 the homologues of each pair of homologous
chromosomes separate and go to opposite poles. Which chromosome goes to which pole depends upon the
orientation of a chromosome pair at the metaphase plate. This orientation and subsequent separation is random for
each homologous pair. For some chromosome pairs, the chromosome that is mostly maternal may go to one pole,
but for another pair, the maternal chromosome may go to the other pole.
3. Joining of gametes. Because sexual reproduction requires the gametes of two individuals, new and variable
combinations are created. Further variation is introduced because which sperm fertilizes which egg is to a large
degree a random event. In many cases, however, this event may be affected by the genetic composition of a gamete.
For example, some sperm may be faster swimmers and have a better chance of fertilizing the egg.
Regulation of the Cell Cycle
Various factors determine whether and when a cell divides. Two functional limitations for cell size li
