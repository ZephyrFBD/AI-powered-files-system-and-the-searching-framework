 would require the presence of oxygen and mitochondria, so
those choices are all incorrect.
16. (D) Oxygen is a product of photosynthesis, so the areas where the bacteria congregated would correspond with
the areas that carried out the most photosynthesis. According to the table, wavelengths of 420–470 nm and 660–
700 nm correspond to blue-violet and red light, respectively, so those colors of light resulted in the greatest
amount of photosynthesis. Photosynthetic pigments absorb light of specific wavelengths; not every wavelength
of light can drive the process of photosynthesis, making choice (A) incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because
aerobic bacteria are not required for the algae to produce oxygen; the concentration of aerobic bacteria are used
as an indirect measure of the amount of oxygen produced. According to the table, green light has a wavelength
in the range of 495–570 nm, which does not correspond to the areas where the greatest numbers of bacteria
congregated. Therefore
