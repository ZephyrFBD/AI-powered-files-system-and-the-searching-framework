CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
62. Why are plants with shallow roots more easily
damaged by some herbivores?
a.
Shallow roots do not anchor the plant to the
ground and can be easily uprooted. Once the
plant is no longer in the ground, the roots are
unable to grow back.
b.
Plants with shallow roots do not anchor the plant
to the ground; meristems can be easily damaged
and cannot grow back when not in the ground.
c.
Shallow roots do not anchor the plant to the
ground and can be easily uprooted. Once the
plant is no longer in the ground, roots take a
long time to grow back.
d.
Shallow roots anchor the plant to the ground
strongly but can be easily uprooted, and they
grow back very slowly.
63. A researcher intends to test the effects of several
growth factors on the differentiation of plant tissue. What
would be the best choice of experimental tissue?
a.
dermal tissue
b.
meristematic tissue
c.

d.
