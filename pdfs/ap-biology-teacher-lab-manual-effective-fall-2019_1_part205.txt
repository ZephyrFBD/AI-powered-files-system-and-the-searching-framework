is model will 
allow for the exploration of parameters that affect allele frequencies, such as selection, 
mutation, and migration. 
The second part of the investigation asks the students to generate their own questions 
regarding the evolution of allele frequencies in a population. Then students will explore 
possible answers to those questions by applying more sophisticated computer models. 
These models are available for free. 
This investigation also provides an opportunity for students to review concepts they 
might have studied previously, including natural selection as the major mechanism 
of evolution; the relationship among genotype, phenotype, and natural selection; and 
fundamentals of classic Mendelian genetics. 
Without an opportunity to build these skills, students, when faced with more 
sophisticated, prebuilt models, tend to click randomly, with no particular plan in mind, 
rather than use a systematic exploration of the modelâ€™s parameters and output. Likewise, 
without
