12. To diï¬€erentiate between two unique carbohydrates, scientists
added equal concentrations of both of them to a bag with
selective permeability and submerged it in a container of water, as
shown in the image below.
Both molecules are composed of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen,
but only one is able to move through the membrane. The mass of
each substance at the beginning, middle, and end of the
experiment is shown in the table below.
