a.
Development of antibiotic-susceptible bacteria that can be transferred to humans, and their presence makes
treatment of disease with antibiotics (in animals or humans) much more difficult.
b.
Development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that cannot be transferred to humans, and their presence makes
treatment of disease with antibiotics (in animals or humans) much more difficult.
c.
Development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that can be transferred to humans, and their presence makes
treatment of disease with antibiotics (in animals or humans) much more difficult.
d.
Development of antibiotic-susceptible bacteria that cannot be transferred to humans, and their presence
makes treatment of disease with antibiotics (in animals or humans) much more difficult.
One of the Superbugs: MRSA
