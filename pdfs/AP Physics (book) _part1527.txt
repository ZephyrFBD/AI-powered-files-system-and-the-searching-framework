and thus reduce heat loss to the outside). To take them into account we would
have to add (small) additional terms to the equation.

EXAMPLE 14;5
The exchange of energy, as exemplified in Example 14–4, is the basis for a
technique known as calorimetry, which is the quantitative measurement of heat
exchange. To make such measurements, a calorimeter is used; a simple water
calorimeter is shown in Fig. 14–4. It is very important that the calorimeter be well
insulated so that almost no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. One impor-
tant use of the calorimeter is in the determination of specific heats of substances.
In the technique known as the “method o
