f amino acids is called elongation. Remember that the mRNA contains many codons, or “triplets,” of
nucleotide bases. As each amino acid is brought to the mRNA, it is linked to its neighboring amino acid by a peptide
bond. When many amino acids link up, a polypeptide is formed.
Termination
How does this process know when to stop? The synthesis of a polypeptide is ended by stop codons. A codon
doesn’t always code for an amino acid; there are three that serve as a stop codon. Termination occurs when the
ribosome runs into one of these three stop codons.
How about a little review?
In transcription, mRNA is created from a particular gene segment of DNA.
In eukaryotes, the mRNA is “processed” by having its introns, or noncoding sequences, removed. A 5’ cap and
a 3’ tail are also added.
Now, ready to be translated, mRNA proceeds to the ribosome.
Free-floating amino acids are picked up by tRNA and shuttled over to the ribosome, where mRNA awaits.
In translation, the anticodon of a tRNA molecul
