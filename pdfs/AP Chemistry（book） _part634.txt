ced equation, however, 1 mol K3PO4 requires 3 mol 
AgNO3. Thus, there is insufficient AgNO3 to consume the 
K3PO4, and AgNO3 is the limiting reactant.
(c)  
The precipitate is Ag3PO4, whose molar mass is 31107.92 + 31.0 + 
4116.02 =  418.7 g>mol. To calculate the number of grams of 
Ag3PO4 that could be produced in this reaction (the theoret-
ical yield), we use the number of moles of the limiting reac-
tant, converting mol AgNO3 1 mol Ag3PO4 1 g Ag3PO4. We 
use the coefficients in the balanced equation to convert moles of 
AgNO3 to moles Ag3PO4, and we use the molar mass of Ag3PO4 
to convert the number of moles of this substance to grams.
17.5 * 10-4 mol AgNO32a
1 mol Ag3PO4
3 mol AgNO3
b a
418.7 g Ag3PO4
1 mol Ag3PO4
b 
= 0.10 g Ag3PO4
The answer has only two significant figures because the quantity 
of AgNO3 is given to only two significant figures.
