izes on the main sequence. Exactly where
the star falls along the main sequence depends on its mass. The more massive the
star, the farther up (and to the left) it falls on the H–R diagram of Fig. 33–6.
Our Sun required perhaps 30 million years to reach the main sequence, and is
expected to remain there about 10 billion years 
Although most stars are
billions of years old, evidence is strong that stars are actually being born at this
moment. More massive stars have shorter lives, because they are hotter and the
Coulomb repulsion is more easily overcome, so they use up their fuel faster.
Our Sun may remain on the main sequence for 
but a star ten times
more massive may reside there for only 
As hydrogen fuses to form helium, the helium that is formed is denser and
tends to accumulate in the central core where it was formed. As the core of
helium grows, hydrogen continues to fuse in a shell around it: see Fig. 33–7.
When much of the hydrogen within the core has been consumed, the product
