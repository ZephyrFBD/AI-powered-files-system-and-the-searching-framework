n field can be noted from Fig. 22–6. First, the
electric and magnetic fields at any point are perpendicular to each other, and to the
direction of wave travel. Second, we can see that the fields alternate in direction
(
is into the page at some points and out of the page at others;
points up at
some points and down at others). Thus, the field strengths vary from a maximum
in one direction, to zero, to a maximum in the other direction. The electric and
magnetic fields are “in phase”: that is, they each are zero at the same points and
reach their maxima at the same points in space. Finally, very far from the antenna
(Fig. 22–6b) the field lines are quite flat over a reasonably large area, and the
waves are referred to as plane waves.

If the source voltage varies sinusoidally, then the electric and magnetic field
strengths in the radiation field will also vary sinusoidally. The s
