same habitat and their relative abundance is known as species diversity. Areas with low
diversity, such as the glaciers of Antarctica, still contain a wide variety of living things, whereas the diversity of tropical
rainforests is so great that it cannot be counted. Ecology is studied at the community level to understand how species interact
with each other and compete for the same resources.
Predation and Herbivory
Perhaps the classical example of species interaction is predation: the hunting of prey by its predator. Nature shows on
television highlight the drama of one living organism killing another. Populations of predators and prey in a community
are not constant over time: in most cases, they vary in cycles that appear to be related. The most often cited example of
predator-prey dynamics is seen in the cycling of the lynx (predator) and the snowshoe hare (prey), using nearly 200 year-old
trapping data from North American forests (Figure 36.19). This cycle of predator and prey las
