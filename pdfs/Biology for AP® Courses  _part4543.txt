a certain stimulus.
c.
The alarm call is an innate behavior and contact
call is a learned behavior. Innate behavior
develops over time in response to stimulus after
continuous exposure. Learned behavior develops
over time after observing other birds carrying
out their behavior.
d.
The alarm call is a learned behavior and contact
call is an innate behavior. Learned behavior
comes out automatically whereas innate
behavior develops over time in response to
stimulus after continuous exposure.
75. Mammals such as humans show a behavior known as
the flight or fight response. Explain how natural selection
was likely involved in the development of this behavior
that can be observed in humans today.
a.
Individuals showing fight or flight behavior was
more likely to survive than individuals lacking
the trait. This trait got randomly selected by
natural selection, thus became preferentially
incorporated into the human lineage.
b.
Individuals showing fight or flight behavior
were more l
