cetylene. For part (d), we 
need to recall that ∆Hrxn = g1bond enthalpies of bonds broken2
- g1bond enthalpies of bonds formed2. 
 (Section 8.8) For 
part (e), we need to realize that the lowest energy absorbed by 
a material will tell us its band gap Eg (for a semiconductor or 
insulator) and combine E = hn and c = ln together 1E = hc>l2 
to solve for Eg.

(a) Carbon usually forms four bonds. Thus, each C atom must have  
a single bond to H and a triple bond to the other C atom in 
acetylene. As a result, each C atom has two electron domains and 
must be sp hybridized. This sp hybridization also means that the 
H ¬C ¬ C angles in acetylene are 180° and the molecule is linear.
 
We can write out the partial structure of polyacetylene as follows:
H

Each carbon is identical but now has three bonding electron 
domains that surround it. Therefore, the hybridization of 
each carbon atom is sp2, and each carbon has local trigonal 
planar geometry with 120° angles.
