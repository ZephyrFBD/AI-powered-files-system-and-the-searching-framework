e of us. It helps us with some digestion and makes some things we
need. We have a mutualistic relationship with our gut bacteria.
The human microbiome is the collection of all the microbes in and on your
body. We depend on a huge number of microbes to stay alive. Characterizing
and understanding this population is a growing area of research.
Bacteria divide by fission; however, this does not increase their genetic diversity. Instead, they can perform
conjugation with other bacterial cells and swap some of their DNA. Bacteria can also gain genetic information
through transformation (uptake of DNA) and transposition (movement of DNA within and between DNA
molecules). All of these methods increase the genetic variation of bacteria. Genetic variety among bacteria is leading
to increased antibiotic resistance.
Variations on Genetic Variation

variation makes it more likely that a population will survive a catastrophi
