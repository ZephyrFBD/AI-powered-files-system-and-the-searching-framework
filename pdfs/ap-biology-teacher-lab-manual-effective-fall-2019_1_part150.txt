stalk attaching the blade to the stem) — a much smaller and 
more reasonable amount to count, but you’ll still need to work out whether or not it is a 
representative sample. 
Measuring phenomena in the real world presents similar challenges. Investigation 
10: Energy Dynamics introduces you to energy dynamics by measuring the biomass of 
growing organisms. How do you measure the mass of a small caterpillar? What about 
the water in the organism? Is water included in “biomass”? It is your challenge to come 
up with solutions to these problems, and to define all measurements carefully so that 
someone could measure in the same way you did and replicate the experiment. Perhaps 
you could measure a quantity of caterpillars and sacrifice a few caterpillars to estimate 
how much the “wet mass” of a caterpillar is biomass, and how much is water. You will 
have to perform relatively simple calculations, including percentages, ratios, averages, 
and means. 
Nearly every lab investigation requi
