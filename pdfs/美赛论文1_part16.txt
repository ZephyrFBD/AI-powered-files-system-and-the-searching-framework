lly consider and measure three main factors of the sustainable 
development, we find that there are relations with each main factor. One of main 
factor is in the condition of sustainable development, which will bring positive effect 
on the remaining main factor, and vice versa. We use the linear weighted method to 
process the dynamic weighting indexes gained in Chapter 2.3 and the weights gained 
in the secondary criteria layer to describe three main factors of the sustainable 
development in the first criteria layer. So we make the following assumptions: 
 The connection between the one main factor and another main factor can 
correspond to the proportion of one main factor and the proportion of main factor

for each other.  
 The proportion of the main factor to the influence of one part can correspond to 
the function of [0, 1]*[0, 1], and the opposite of proportion influence will be its 
inverse function.  
 The selection and formation of the influ
