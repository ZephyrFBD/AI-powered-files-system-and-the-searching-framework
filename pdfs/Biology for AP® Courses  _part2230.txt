data from many sources, scientists can put together the phylogeny of an organism; since phylogenetic trees are hypotheses,
they will continue to change as new types of life are discovered and new information is learned.
Limitations of Phylogenetic Trees
It may be easy to assume that more closely related organisms look more alike, and while this is often the case, it is not
always true. If two closely related lineages evolved under significantly varied surroundings or after the evolution of a major
new adaptation, it is possible for the two groups to appear more different than other groups that are not as closely related.
For example, the phylogenetic tree in Figure 20.4 shows that lizards and rabbits both have amniotic eggs, whereas frogs do
not; yet lizards and frogs appear more similar than lizards and rabbits.

At each branch point, organisms with different chara
