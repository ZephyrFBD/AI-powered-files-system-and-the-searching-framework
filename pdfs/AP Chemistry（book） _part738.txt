actants and products of the reaction are 
the system, and the water in which they are dissolved is part of the surroundings. (The 
calorimeter apparatus is also part of the surroundings.) If we assume that the calorime-
ter is perfectly insulated, then any heat released or absorbed by the reaction will raise 
or lower the temperature of the water in the solution. Thus, we measure the tempera-
ture change of the solution and assume that any changes are due to heat transferred 
from the reaction to the water (for an exothermic process) or transferred from the 
water to the reaction (endothermic). In other words, by monitoring the temperature 
of the solution, we are seeing the flow of heat between the system (the reactants and 
products in the solution) and the surroundings (the water that forms the bulk of the 
solution).
For an exothermic reaction, heat is “lost” by the reaction and “gained” by the water 
in the solution, so the temperature of the solution rises. The opposite occurs fo
