 Earth’s atmosphere.
If its initial temperature was 
outside of Earth’s
atmosphere, calculate the minimum velocity the meteorite
must have had before it entered Earth’s atmosphere.
62. The temperature of the glass surface of a 75-W lightbulb is
75°C when the room temperature is 18°C. Estimate the
temperature of a 150-W lightbulb with a glass bulb the same
size. Consider only radiation, and assume that 90% of the
energy is emitted as heat.
63. In a cold environment, a person can lose heat by conduction
and radiation at a rate of about 200 W. Estimate how long it
would take for the body temperature to drop from 36.6°C
to 35.6°C if metabolism were nearly to stop. Assume a mass
of 65 kg. (See Table 14–1.)

Thermodynamics is the study of heat and work. Heat is a transfer of energy due to a difference of temperature. Work is a 
transfer of energy by mechanical means, not due to a temperature difference. The first law of thermodynamics links the two
