 processing for miRNAs.
7. mRNA degradation occurs as a result of RNAi (above), but also because mRNAs are unstable molecules. The
poly-A tail and the 5â€² cap help maintain mRNA stability on a scale of hours. But degradation of the tail occurs as the
mRNA ages and degrading enzymes, targeting the tail and cap, quickly follow. Meanwhile, sequences rich in
adenine and uracil in untranslated regions of the mRNA are recognition sites for other degrading enzymes.
8. Protein degradation is the final stage in the life of proteins. As proteins age, they lose functionality as their 3-
dimensional shape changes. Nonfunctional proteins are marked for destruction with the protein ubiquitin (so called
because it is ubiquitous, present in all eukaryotic cells).
Cells in the early stages of embryonic development are stem cells. When stem cells divide, daughter cells have the
potential to become any kind of fetal or adult cell. But as development continues, cells differentiate, become
specialized, and
