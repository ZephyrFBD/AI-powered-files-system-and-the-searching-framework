 two plates are initially separated by a distance d. Suppose the plates
are pulled apart until the separation is 2d. How has the energy stored in this
capacitor changed?
RESPONSE If we increase the plate separation d, we decrease the capacitance
according to Eq. 17–8,
by a factor of 2. The charge Q hasn’t
changed. So according to Eq. 17–10, where we choose the form
because we know Q is the same and C has been halved, the reduced C means
the PE stored increases by a factor of 2.
NOTE We can see why the energy stored increases from a physical point of
view: the two plates are charged equal and opposite, so they attract each other.
If we pull them apart, we must do work, so we raise the potential energy.

It is useful to think of the energy stored in a capacitor as being stored in the
electric field between the plates. As an example let us calculate the energy stored
in a parallel-plate capacitor in terms of the electric field.
We have se
