g the empirical formula involves 
the three steps given in Figure 3.13.

formula
In 100.00 g of ascorbic acid we have 40.92 g C, 4.58 g H, and 54.50 g O.
(2) Next we calculate the number of moles of each element. We use atomic masses with four significant figures to match the precision  
of our experimental masses.

Moles H = 14.58 g H2a 1 mol C
1.008 g H b = 4.54 mol H
 
 
Moles O = 154.50 g O2a 1 mol O
16.00 g O b = 3.406 mol O
