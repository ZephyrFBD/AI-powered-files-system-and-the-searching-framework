through respiratory system with lungs and air sacs. Archaeopteryx and
Xiaotingia, for example, were flying dinosaurs and are believed to be early precursors of birds.
Figure 30.14 (a) Birds have a flow-through respiratory system in which air flows unidirectionally from the posterior
sacs into the lungs, then into the anterior air sacs. The air sacs connect to openings in hollow bones. (b)
Dinosaurs, from which birds descended, have similar hollow bones and are believed to have had a similar
respiratory system. (credit b: modification of work by Zina Deretsky, National Science Foundation)
