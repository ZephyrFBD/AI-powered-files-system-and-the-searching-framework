inds to the EGFR, a cascade of
downstream events causes the cell to grow and divide. If EGFR is activated at inappropriate times, uncontrolled
cell growth may occur.
In certain cancers, the GTPase activity of the RAS G-protein is inhibited. This means that the RAS protein can no
longer hydrolyze GTP into GDP. What effect would this have on downstream cellular events?
a.
Cells will not proliferate.
b.
ERK is permanently inactivated.
c.
Regulated cell division.
d.
Uncontrolled cell proliferation.
Signaling pathways can get very complicated very quickly because most cellular proteins can affect different downstream
events, depending on the conditions within the cell. A single pathway can branch off toward different endpoints based on
the interplay between two or more signaling pathways, and the same ligands are often used to initiate different signals in
