of the emitted electrons? (c) What is the
de Broglie wavelength of these electrons?
3.53 * 10–28 kgms
93. An electron accelerated from rest by a 96-V potential
difference is injected into a 
magnetic field
where it travels in an 18-cm-diameter circle. Calculate 
from this information.
94. Estimate the number of photons emitted by the Sun in a
year. (Take the average wavelength to be 550 nm and the
intensity of sunlight reaching the Earth (outer atmosphere)
as 
)
95. Apply Bohr’s assumptions to the Earth–Moon system to
calculate the allowed energies and radii of motion. Given
the known distance between the Earth and Moon, is the
quantization of the energy and radius apparent?
96. At what temperature would the average kinetic energy
(Chapter 13) of a molecule of hydrogen gas 
be suffi-
cient to excite a hydrogen atom out of the ground state?
(H2)
1350 Wm2 .
