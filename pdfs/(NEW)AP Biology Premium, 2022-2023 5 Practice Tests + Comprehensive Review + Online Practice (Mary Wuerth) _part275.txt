I stage of meiosis. However, unlike in mitosis, homologous
chromosomes pair up and genetic recombination (also known as crossing-over) can occur in prophase I of
meiosis. This has profound effects on genetic diversity, which will be discussed later in this chapter.
■In the metaphase stage of mitosis, chromosomes line up in a single column along the center of the cell. In the
metaphase I stage of meiosis, however, chromosomes line up in homologous pairs along the center of the
cell.
■During the anaphase stage of mitosis, the sister chromatids in each chromosome separate and move toward
opposite ends of the cell. Each of these sister chromatids has its own centromere after this separation, so the
number of chromosomes in the cell is doubled by the end of the anaphase stage of mitosis. In the anaphase I
stage of meiosis, pairs of homologous chromosomes separate. There are the same number of chromosomes at
the end of the anaphase I stage of meiosis as there are at the beginning of this sta
