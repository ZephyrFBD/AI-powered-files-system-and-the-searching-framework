ded to make it bounce back up?
(b) If so, what exerts the force?

Question 9.
In Problems involving a slope or an “inclined plane,” avoid making errors in
the directions of the normal force and gravity. The normal force on an incline is
not vertical: it is perpendicular to the slope or plane. And gravity is not perpendic-
ular to the slope—gravity acts vertically downward toward the center of the Earth.

on a 1-kg rock. Why then doesn’t the heavier rock fall
faster?

11. (a) You pull a box with a constant force across a frictionless
table using an attached rope held horizontally. If you now
pull the rope with the same force at an angle to the hori-
zontal (with the box remaining flat on the table), does the
acceleration of the box increase, decrease, or remain the
same? Explain. (b)
