st, many introns
have been deleted. Because introns do not encode proteins,
mutations can remain silent and accumulate.
A. As described above, introns are ancestral remnants that
are replicated because they do not disadvantage the
organism. Consider the claim that introns are “junk DNA.”
Evaluate the claim with supporting evidence.
B. Introns may be retained during transcription. Explain
how the retention of a transcribed intron between two
transcribed exons within a gene could do the following:
•
block expression of one polypeptide sequence
•
increase expression of a polypeptide
•
alter the polypeptide expressed

every cell. The control of which genes are expressed dictates whether a cell is (a) an eye
