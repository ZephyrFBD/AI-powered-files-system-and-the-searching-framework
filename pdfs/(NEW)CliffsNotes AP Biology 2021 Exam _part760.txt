sequence are paired, nucleotide by nucleotide, for
each species. A fraction and percentage are given for the nucleotides that are identical (e.g., 5575/5575, 100%) and
for the gaps that occur where parts of the sequence is missing (e.g., 0/5575, 0%). The alignment score takes into
account both of these values.
Once you’ve obtained a BLAST result for your sequence, use the alignment scores to support your placement of the
fossil on your cladogram. Only consider sequences with E values smaller than 0.01% (0.0001 or 1e-04), as values
larger than this suggest that the match occurs by chance and not from a biological relationship.
Part II: Additional Investigations Using BLAST
For the remainder of the lab, you explore a gene or protein of your choice using the BLAST resource.
Investigation 4: Diffusion and Osmosis
This investigation provides exercises that examine the movement of water across selectively permeable membranes.
Refer to Chapter 3, “Cells,” for a complete review of diffusion, o
