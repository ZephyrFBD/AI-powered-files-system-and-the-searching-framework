Ball thrown upward at edge of cliff. Suppose that the 
person of Examples 2–12, 2–13, and 2–15 throws the ball upward at 
while standing on the edge of a cliff, so that the ball can fall to the 
base of the cliff 50.0 m below, as shown in Fig. 2–25a. (a) How long does it 
take the ball to reach the base of the cliff? (b) What is the total distance trav-
eled by the ball? Ignore air resistance (likely to be significant, so our result is an
approximation).
APPROACH We again use Eq. 2–11b, with y as
upward, but this time we set
the bottom of the cliff, which is 50.0 m below the initial position
hence the minus sign.
SOLUTION (a) We use Eq. 2–11b with
and
To solve any quadratic equation of the form 
where a, b, and c are constants (a is not acceleration here), we use the quadratic
formula (see Appendix A–4):
We rewrite our y equation just above in standard form,
Using the quadratic formula, we find as solutions  
and
The first solution,
is the answer we are seeking:
