 ‘collides’ with the other half of the
laser (Fig 14). This creates a waveform interference paĴern which
contains the waveﬁeld information of whatever is being
photographed (Fig 15 overleaf). The process can be likened to
dropping pebbles in a pond. Waves generated by each one spread
out across the water to collide with the others and create a wave
representation of where the stones fell and at what speed, weight
and distance. A waveform interference paĴern of a hologram is akin
to the waveform information in The Field which the ﬁve senses
decode into electrical signals to be decoded by the brain into a
holographic illusory ‘physical’ reality. In the same way when a laser
(think human aĴention) is directed at the waveform interference
paĴern a three-dimensional version of the subject is projected into
apparently ‘solid’ reality (Fig 16). An amazing trait of holograms
reveals more ‘paranormal mysteries’. Information of the whole
hologram is encoded in waveform in every part of the inter
