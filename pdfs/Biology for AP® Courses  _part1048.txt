n increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) inside the cell. Also known as epinephrine, adrenaline is a hormone
(produced by the adrenal gland attached to the kidney) that readies the body for short-term emergencies. Cyclic AMP
activates PKA (protein kinase A), which in turn phosphorylates two enzymes. The first enzyme promotes the degradation
of glycogen by activating intermediate glycogen phosphorylase kinase (GPK) that in turn activates glycogen phosphorylase
(GP) that catabolizes glycogen into glucose. (Recall that your body converts excess glucose to glycogen for short-term
storage. When energy is needed, glycogen is quickly reconverted to glucose.) Phosphorylation of the second enzyme,
glycogen synthase (GS), inhibits its ability to form glycogen from glucose. In this manner, a muscle cell obtains a ready
pool of glucose by activating its formation via glycogen degradation and by inhibiting the use of glucose to form glycogen,
thus preventing a futile cycle of glycogen degradation and synthe
