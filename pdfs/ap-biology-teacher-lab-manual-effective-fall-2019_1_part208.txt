 start over completely but can bring up a file 
that had the beginnings of a working model. 
Encourage idea sharing but not necessarily file swapping. Students should generate 
their own work to get the maximal benefit from this exercise.  
Finally, your students may be able to produce a rudimentary spreadsheet but have 
difficulty refining the sheet. Consider having these students rely on a hybrid approach — 
use the spreadsheet to generate the random samples, but use reliable pencil and paper to 
archive and graph the results.  
The other issue to consider is the ease of digital reproduction and sharing. Without 
a doubt, the students will be able find a Hardy-Weinberg spreadsheet model on the 
Internet. Likewise, it will be easy for them to share with one another. Keep this in mind 
as you make the assignment, and consider having most of the work done in class if you 
have access to computers.
