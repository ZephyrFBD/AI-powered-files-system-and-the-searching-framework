Finding average rates of change is important in many contexts.  
The average rate of change of the function y = f(x) between x = a and x = b is

The average rate of change is the slope of the secant line between x = a and x = b on the 
graph of f, that is, the line that passes through (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)). 
 
 
Example 1 
For the function f(x) = (x-3)2 whose graph is shown below, find the net change and the 
average rate of change between the following points: 
(a) x = 1 and x = 3 
(b) x = 4 and x = 7

1.4.1 Linear Functions 
Note that a linear function is a function of the form f (x) = ax + b.
