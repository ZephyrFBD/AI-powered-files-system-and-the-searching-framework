 compounds. Two of these 
that you might encounter in the laboratory are the sulfide ion and the carbonate 
ion. Both of these anions react with acids to form gases that have low solubilities in 
water.
Hydrogen sulfide 1H2S), the substance that gives rotten eggs their foul odor, forms 
when an acid such as HCl(aq) reacts with a metal sulfide such as Na2S:
Molecular equation:
 
2 HCl1aq2 + Na2S1aq2 ยก H2S1g2 + 2 NaCl1aq2 
[4.16]
Net ionic equation:
 
2 H+1aq2 + S2-1aq2 ยก H2S1g2 
[4.17]
Carbonates and bicarbonates react with acids to form CO21g2. Reaction of CO3
2- or 
HCO3
- with an acid first gives carbonic acid 1H2CO32. For example, when hydrochloric 
acid is added to sodium bicarbonate, the reaction is
 
HCl1aq2 + NaHCO31aq2 ยก NaCl1aq2 + H2CO31aq2 
[4.18]
Carbonic acid is unstable. If present in solution in sufficient concentrations, it decom-
poses to H2O and CO2, which escapes from the solution as a gas:
 
H2CO31aq2 ยก H2O1l2 + CO21g2 
[4.19]
