96. A parallel-plate capacitor with plate area 
and
plate separation 
is connected to a 35-V battery
(Fig.17–51a). (a) Determine the charge on the capacitor, the
electric field, the capacitance, and the energy stored in 
the capacitor. (b) With the capacitor still connected to the
battery, a slab of plastic with dielectric strength 
is placed between the plates of the capacitor, so that the gap is
completely filled with the dielectric (Fig. 17–51b). What are
the new values of charge,
electric field, capacitance,
and the energy stored in
the capacitor?

94. In the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) of a
computer, each memory cell contains a capacitor for
charge storage. Each of these cells represents a single binary-
bit value of “1” when its 35-fF capacitor 
is
charged at 1.5 V, or “0” when uncharged at 0 V. (a) When
fully charged, how many excess electrons are
