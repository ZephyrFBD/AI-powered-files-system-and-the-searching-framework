44. (I) If a soap bubble is 120 nm thick, what wavelength is
most strongly reflected at the center of the outer surface
when illuminated normally by white light? Assume that
45. (I) How far apart are the dark bands in Example 24–10 if
the glass plates are each 21.5 cm long?
46. (II) (a) What is the smallest thickness of a soap film
that would appear black if illuminated with 480-nm
light? Assume there is air on both sides of the soap film.
(b) What are two other possible thicknesses for the film to
appear black? (c) If the thickness was much less than 
why would the film also appear black?
