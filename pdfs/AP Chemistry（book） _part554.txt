soluble 
in water.
Plan We can use Table 4.1 to answer the question. Thus, we need 
to focus on the anion in each compound because the table is orga-
nized by anions.
Solve
(a)  
According to Table 4.1, most carbonates are insoluble. But carbon-
ates of the alkali metal cations (such as sodium ion) are an excep-
tion to this rule and are soluble. Thus, Na2CO3 is soluble in water.
(b)  
Table 4.1 indicates that although most sulfates are water solu-
ble, the sulfate of Pb2+ is an exception. Thus, PbSO4 is insolu-
ble in water.
