fined, and how magnetic fields
exert forces on electric currents and
on charged particles. We also discuss
useful applications of the interaction
between magnetic fields and electric
currents and moving electric charges,
such as motors and loudspeakers.
CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
Which of the following can experience a force when placed in the magnetic field
of a magnet?
(a) An electric charge at rest.
(c) An electric current in a wire.
(b) An electric charge moving.
(d) Another magnet.
T
he history of magnetism began thousands of years ago, when in a region of
Asia Minor known as Magnesia, rocks were found that could attract each
other. These rocks were called “magnets” after their place of discovery.
Not until the nineteenth century, however, was it seen that magnetism and
electricity are closely related. A crucial discovery was that electric currents produce
magnetic effects (we will say “magnetic fields”) like magnets do. All kinds of
practical devices depend on magnetism,
