re likely to have a statistically significant difference between them.
15. (D) At higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, more substrate was available to the enzyme so more
oxygen was produced and the paper disks floated faster. The amount of heat generated did not change with
higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, so choice (A) is incorrect. There is no evidence that more
concentrated hydrogen peroxide changed the shape of the active site of the enzyme, so choice (B) is incorrect.
Oxygen is not an allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme, so choice (C) is also incorrect.
16. (C) Boiling denatures most enzymes, irreversibly changing their shape so they do not function. Choice (A) is
incorrect because the enzyme is exposed to the boiling water bath, not the hydrogen peroxide. Boiling will
change the time required for the paper disk to float, so choice (B) is incorrect. Not all enzymes are less effective
at higher temperatures, so choice (D) is incorrect.
17. (B) Oxygen is the final e
