Give It Some Thought
A solute dissolved in water causes the boiling point to increase by 0.51 °C. Does 
this necessarily mean that the concentration of the solute is 1.0 m (Table 13.3)?
Automotive antifreeze contains ethylene glycol, CH21OH2CH21OH2, a nonvolatile nonelectrolyte, in water. Calculate the boiling 
point and freezing point of a 25.0% by mass solution of ethylene glycol in water.
Solve
The molality of the solution is calculated 
as follows:
We can now use Equati
