14.89 Consider the reaction A + B ¡ C + D. Is each of the fol-
lowing statements true or false? (a) The rate law for the reac-
tion must be Rate = k3A43B4. (b) If the reaction is an elemen-
tary reaction, the rate law is second order. (c) If the reaction is 
an elementary reaction, the rate law of the reverse reaction is 
ﬁrst order. (d) The activation energy for the reverse reaction 
must be greater than that for the forward reaction.
 14.90 Hydrogen sulﬁde 1H2S2 is a common and troublesome 
pollutant in industrial wastewaters. One way to remove 
H2S is to treat the water with chlorine, in which case the 
following reaction occurs:
H2S1aq2 + Cl21aq2 ¡ S1s2 + 2 H+1aq2 + 2 Cl -1aq2
 
 The rate of this reaction is ﬁrst order in each reactant. 
The rate constant for the disappearance of
