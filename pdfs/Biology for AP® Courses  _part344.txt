Even though the RNA is single stranded, most RNA types show extensive intramolecular base pairing between
complementary sequences, creating a predictable three-dimensional structure essential for their function.
As you have learned, information flow in an organism takes place from DNA to RNA to protein. DNA dictates the structure
of mRNA in a process known as transcription, and RNA dictates the structure of protein in a process known as translation.
This is known as the Central Dogma of Life, which holds true for all organisms; however, exceptions to the rule occur in
connection with viral infections.
