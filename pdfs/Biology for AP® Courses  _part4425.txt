Parasitism
A parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and derives nutrients from it. In this relationship,
the parasite benefits, but the organism being fed upon, the host is harmed. The host is usually weakened by the parasite
as it siphons resources the host would normally use to maintain itself. The parasite, however, is unlikely to kill the host,
especially not quickly, because this would allow no time for the organism to complete its reproductive cycle by spreading
to another host.
The reproductive cycles of parasites are often very complex, sometimes requiring more than one host species. A tapeworm
is a parasite that causes disease in humans when contaminated, undercooked meat such as pork, fish, or beef is consumed
(Figure 36.28). The tapeworm can live inside the intestine of the host for several years, benefiting from the food the host
