s of nitrogen. The only organic
form of nitrogen among the answer choices is found in (C).
59. A
The conversion of ammonia or ammonium to nitrate is an oxidation
reaction. The only other reaction among the options provided that is
also oxidation is the metabolism of glucose to carbon dioxide (CO2).
(A) is thus correct.
60. A
From the figure, it can be seen that free nitrogen (N2) does not flow
directly from the atmosphere into plants. This makes (A) a viable
explanation and the correct answer. Indeed, plants must obtain
nitrogen through absorption of ammonium and nitrate, which rules
out (B). Unlike other minerals, ammonium and nitrate are not derived
from the breakdown of rock, so (C) is incorrect as well. (D) is untrue
because there is more than enough nitrogen in the atmosphere to
facilitate all plant needs; it just happens to be in a form (N2) that plants
cannot utilize directly.
