(a) Assuming that species I is the ancestral species of the group, explain the most likely genetic 
change that produced the polypeptide in species II and the most likely genetic change that 
produced the polypeptide in species III. (2 points maximum) 
 
Explanation: 1 point per row 
NOTE: Specific names of mutation types are not required. 
Species 
Genetic Change in DNA / Bases 
Result of Change to Polypeptide / Protein 
II 
mutation / substitution / point 
mutation / missense mutation 
an amino acid change only at position 4 (Val to 
Lys)  
III 
mutation (e.g., substitution / insertion / 
deletion / point mutation / frameshift 
mutation / nonsense mutation) that 
introduces a stop codon after the 
codon for Val
