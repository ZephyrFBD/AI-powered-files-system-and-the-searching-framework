Weight, normal force, and a box. A friend has given you 
a special gift, a box of mass 10.0 kg with a mystery surprise inside. The box is
resting on the smooth (frictionless) horizontal surface of a table (Fig. 4–15a).
(a) Determine the weight of the box and the normal force exerted on it by 
the table. (b) Now your friend pushes down on the box with a force of 40.0 N,
as in Fig. 4–15b. Again determine the normal force exerted on the box by 
the table. (c) If your friend pulls upward on the box with a force of 40.0 N 
(Fig. 4–15c), what now is the normal force exerted on the box by the table?
APPROACH The box is a
