population inhabits; see Figure 12.1. The most common pattern of
dispersion is clumped. Fish travel this way in schools because there is
safety in numbers. Some populations are spread in a uniform pattern. For
example, certain plants may secrete toxins that keep away other plants that
would compete for limited resources. Random spacing occurs in the
absence of any special attractions or repulsions. Trees can be spaced
randomly in a forest.

4. Survivorship Curves
Survivorship or mortality curves show the size and composition of a
population. There are three types of survivorship curves.
Type 1 curves show organisms with low death rates in young and
middle age and high mortality in old age. There is a great deal of
parenting, which accounts for the high survival rates of the young.
This is characteristic of humans.
Type 2 curves describe
