ion 5.21. (b) We can use the molar mass of 
water and dimensional analysis to convert from heat capacity per 
gram to heat capacity per mole.
Solve
(a) The water undergoes a temperature change of:
∆T = 98 °C - 22 °C = 76 °C = 76 K 
Using Equation 5.21, we have:
(b)  
The molar heat capacity is the heat capacity of one mole of 
substance. Using the atomic weights of hydrogen and oxy-
gen, we have:
Cm = a4.18 J
g@K b a
18.0 g
1 mol b = 75.2 J>mol@K
From the specific heat used in part (a), we have:
1 mol H2O = 18.0 g H2O
 q = Cs * m * ∆T 
 = 14.18 J>g@K21250 g2176 K2 = 7.9 * 104 J
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
The coinage metals (Group 1B) copper, silver, and gold have 
specific heats of 0.385, 0.233, and 0.129 J/g-K, respectively. 
Among this group, the specific heat capacity 
 and 
the molar heat capacity 
 as the atomic weight  
increases. (a) increases, increases (b) increases, decreases  
(c) decreases, increases (d) decreases, decreases
