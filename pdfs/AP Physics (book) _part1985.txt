olts, but a typical event might transfer 
of energy
across a potential difference of perhaps 
during a time interval of about
0.2 s. Use this information to estimate (a) the total amount of charge transferred
between cloud and ground, (b) the current in the lightning bolt, and (c) the
average power delivered over the 0.2 s.
APPROACH We estimate the charge Q, recalling that potential energy change
equals the potential difference 
times the charge Q, Eq. 17–3. We equate
with the energy transferred,
Next, the current I is
(Eq. 18–1) and the power P is energy/time.
SOLUTION (a) From Eq. 17–3, the energy transformed is 
We
solve for Q:
(b) The current during the 0.2 s is about
(c) The average power delivered is
We can also use Eq. 18–5:
NOTE Since most lightning bolts consist of several stages, it is possible that indi-
vidual parts could carry currents much higher than the 100 A calculated above.
P = IV = (100 A)(5 * 107 V) = 5 GW.
P = energy
