 ∆H values, reversing their 
signs if the reactions are reversed and multiplying them by what-
ever coefficient is employed in the equation.
Solve Because the target equation has C2H2 as a product, we turn 
the first equation around; the sign of ∆H is therefore changed. 
The desired equation has 2 C1s2 as a reactant, so we multiply the 
second equation and its ∆H by 2. Because the target equation has 
H2 as a reactant, we keep the third equation as it is. We then add 
the three equations and their enthalpy changes in accordance 
with Hess’s law:
2 CO21g2 + H2O1l2 ¡  C2H21g2 + 5
2  O21g2  - ∆H = 1299.6 kJ 
  2 C1s2 + 2 O21g2 ¡  2 CO21g2  
∆H = -787.0 kJ 
    H21g2 + 1
2 O21g2 ¡  H2O1l2 
∆H = -285.8 kJ 
   2 C1s2 + H21g2 ¡  C2H21g2  
∆H = 226.8 kJ
When the equations are added, there are 2 CO2, 5
2 O2, and H2O 
on both sides of the arrow. These are canceled in writing the net 
equation.
Check The procedure must be correct because we obtained the cor-
rect net equation. In cases like this,
