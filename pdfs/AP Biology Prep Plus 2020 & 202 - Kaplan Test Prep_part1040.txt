eath, such as a famine would be. (B) and (C) are factually
inaccurate.
29. A
The region labeled A is composed of long fatty acid tails of the phospholipids that make
up the cell plasma membrane. These tails are nonpolar, so (A) is correct. Region B is the
polar, hydrophilic region of the molecule, so (B) is incorrect. The structure labeled C is a
membrane-bound protein, making (C) incorrect. The lipid portion of the membrane is
nonpolar and thus hydrophobic, which prevents charged ions such as Na+ from crossing
the membrane, so (D) is incorrect.
30. C
You might have been tempted to choose (D) if you simply added the frequency of
individuals expressing blood type r (0.24 + 0.01) and did the same for blood type F (0.24 +
0.60). This type of addition can lead you to the frequency of the recessive r allele, but it
does not work for the F allele. The frequency of the r blood type (q2 in the Hardy-
Weinberg equation, p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1) is equal to the sum of the last two rows in the table,
