uire energy to move large molecules into 
and out of cells—
a.	In exocytosis, internal vesicles fuse with 
the plasma membrane and secrete large 
macromolecules out of the cell.
b.	In endocytosis, the cell takes in 
macromolecules and particulate matter 
by forming new vesicles derived from the 
plasma membrane.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-2.G
Explain how the structure of 
a molecule affects its ability 
to pass through the plasma 
membrane.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-2.G.1
Membrane proteins are required for facilitated 
diffusion of charged and large polar molecules 
through a membrane—
a.	Large quantities of water pass through 
aquaporins.
b.	Charged ions, including Na+ and K+, 
require channel proteins to move through 
the membrane.
c.	Membranes may become polarized by
