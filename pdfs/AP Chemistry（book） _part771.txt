 
done here, to keep track of the associations between reactions and their ∆H values.)
Notice that we have used Hess’s law to write the standard enthalpy change for Equa-
tion 5.29 as the sum of the enthalpy changes for Equations 5.26 through 5.28. We can 
use values from Table 5.3 to calculate ∆H°
rxn:
∆H°
rxn = ∆H1 + ∆H2 + ∆H3
= -∆Hf°3C3H81g24 + 3∆Hf°3CO21g24 + 4∆Hf°3H2O1l24
= -1-103.85 kJ2 + 31-393.5 kJ2 + 41-285.8 kJ2 = -2220 kJ

The enthalpy diagram in Figure 5.23 shows the components of this calculation. In 
Step 1  the reactants are decomposed into their constituent elements in their standard 
states. In Steps 2  and 3  the products are formed from the elements. Several aspects of 
how we use enthalpy changes in this process depend on the guidelines we discussed in 
Section 5.4.
Decomposition. Equation 5.26 is the reverse of the formation reaction for C3H81g2, 
so the enthalpy change for this decomposition reaction is the negative of the ∆Hf° 
value for the propane format
