(a) Identify which cellular process thylakoids are associated with.
Thylakoids are associated with photosynthesis.
(b) Explain why ions in the hydroponic tank cannot pass into the roots by simple diffusion.
The roots, like all cells, have a phospholipid bilayer membrane. This membrane is not permeable to polar or charged
things. The inner hydrophobic space prevents things like ions from diffusing through. Ions must enter by facilitated
diffusion or sometimes active transport using a pump.
(c) Predict the immediate effect this would have on the cellâ€™s ability to produce reactants necessary for carbon
fixation.
The reactants for the carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle would not be produced.
(d) Justify your prediction.
The permeability of the thylakoid membrane would make the hydrogen ions able to flow freely from one side to the
other. Without the ability to create a concentration gradient with hydrogen ions, the electron transport chain would
fail. This would prevent production of
