ie’s Hypothesis
Applied to Atoms
Bohr’s theory was largely of an ad hoc nature. Assumptions were made so that
theory would agree with experiment. But Bohr could give no reason why the orbits
were quantized, nor why there should be a stable ground state. Finally, ten years
later, a reason was proposed by Louis de Broglie. We saw in Section 27–8 that 
in 1923, de Broglie proposed that material particles, such as electrons, have a wave
nature; and that this hypothesis was confirmed by experiment several years later.
One of de Broglie’s original arguments in favor of the wave nature of elec-
trons was that it provided an explanation for Bohr’s theory of the hydrogen
atom. According to de Broglie, a particle of mass m moving with a nonrelativistic
speed v would have a wavelength (Eq. 27–8) of
Each electron orbit in an atom, he proposed, is actually a standing wave. As we
saw in Chapter 11, when a violin or guitar string is plucked, a vast number of
wavelengths are excited. But only certain
