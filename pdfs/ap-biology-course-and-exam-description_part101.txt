Required Course Content 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-2.K
Describe the membrane-
bound structures of the 
eukaryotic cell.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-2.K.1
Membranes and membrane-bound organelles 
in eukaryotic cells compartmentalize 
intracellular metabolic processes and specific 
enzymatic reactions. 
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
ENE-2
Cells have membranes that allow them to establish and maintain internal 
environments that are different from their external environments.
TOPIC 2.10
Compartmentalization
SUGGESTED SKILL
Argumentation
6.E.a 
Predict the causes or 
effects of a change in, or 
disruption to, one or more 
components in a biological 
system based on biological 
concepts or processes.
ENE-2.L
Explain how internal 
membranes and membrane-
bound organelles contribute 
to compartmentalization of 
eukaryotic cell functions.
