 Helium boils at 4.2 K and 
 
1 atm, the lowest boiling point of any substance. It is found in relatively high concentra-
tions in many natural-gas wells from which it is isolated.
Noble-Gas Compounds
Because the noble gases are exceedingly stable, they react only under rigorous condi-
tions. We expect the heavier ones to be most likely to form compounds because their 
ionization energies are lower. 
 (Figure 7.10) A lower ionization energy suggests the 
possibility of sharing an electron with another atom, leading to a chemical bond. In 
addition, because the group 8A elements (except helium) already contain eight elec-
trons in their valence shell, formation of covalent bonds will require an expanded 
valence shell. Valence-shell expansion occurs most readily with larger atoms. 
 
 (Section 8.7)
The first noble-gas compound was reported in 1962. This discovery caused a sen-
sation because it undercut the belief that the noble-gas elements were inert. The initial 
study involved xenon
