bond, the arrangement is trigonal planar (sp2 hybridization). With a triple bond, it is lin-
ear (sp hybridization). Examples are shown in Figure 24.1.
Almost every organic molecule contains C ¬H bonds. Because the valence shell 
of H can hold only two electrons, hydrogen forms only one covalent bond. As a result,

▲ Figure 24.1 Carbon geometries. The three common geometries around carbon are tetrahedral 
as in methane 1CH42, trigonal planar as in formaldehyde 1CH2O2, and linear as in acetonitrile 
1CH3CN2. Notice that in all cases each carbon atom forms four bonds.
