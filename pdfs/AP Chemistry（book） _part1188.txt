Properties of Metals and Nonmetals (Section 7.6)
 7.55  (a) Does metallic character increase, decrease, or remain 
unchanged as one goes from left to right across a row of the 
periodic table? (b) Does metallic character increase, decrease, 
or remain unchanged as one goes down a column of the peri-
odic table? (c) Are the periodic trends in (a) and (b) the same 
as or different from those for first ionization energy?
 7.56  You read the following statement about two elements X and 
Y: One of the elements is a good conductor of electricity, and 
the other is a semiconductor. Experiments show that the ﬁrst 
ionization energy of X is twice as great as that of Y. Which 
element has the greater metallic character?
 7.57  Discussing this chapter, a classmate says, “An element 
that commonly forms a cation is a metal.” Do you agree or 
disagree?
 7.58  Discussing this chapter, a classmate says, “Since elements 
that form cations are metals and elements that form anions
