a.
The plasma membrane is impermeable to polar molecules, so transport proteins are required.
b.
The plasma membrane is selectively permeable to polar molecules, and a transport protein is required for
larger molecules.
c.
The plasma membrane is permeable to all polar molecules, but a transport protein is required.
d.
The plasma membrane is selectively permeable to all polar molecules and a transport protein is never
required for them.
Animals have an additional membrane constituent that assists in maintaining fluidity. Cholesterol, which lies alongside the
phospholipids in the membrane, tends to dampen the effects of temperature on the membrane. Thus, this lipid functions
as a buffer, preventing lower temperatures from inhibiting fluidity and preventing increased temperatures from increasing
fluidity too much. Thus, cholesterol extends, in both directions, the range of temperature in which the membrane is
appropriately fluid and consequently functional. Cholesterol also serves other
