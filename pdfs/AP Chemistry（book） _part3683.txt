CO is col-
orless and odorless, CO poisoning occurs with very little warning. Improperly venti-
lated combustion devices, such as kerosene lanterns and stoves, thus pose a potential 
health hazard.

A Closer look Entropy and the Chelate Effect
We learned in Section 19.5 that chemical processes are favored by 
positive entropy changes and by negative enthalpy changes. The spe-
cial stability associated with the formation of chelates, called the che-
late effect, can be explained by comparing the entropy changes that 
occur with monodentate ligands with the entropy changes that occur 
with polydentate ligands.
We begin with the reaction in which two H2O ligands of 
the square-planar Cu(II) complex 3Cu(H2O)442+ are replaced by 
monodentate NH
