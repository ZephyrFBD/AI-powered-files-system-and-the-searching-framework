the speed of adding water. Now we can make some changes to the picture above to
describe the relationship between the time and the speed of draining away the water.

Combined with two steps above, including both adding water and draining away
water, we can come to the fact that there are two processes happening in the bathtub:
(1) The flow of the water: In this process, hot water is added into the bathtub, while
the cold water, which is the same volume as the hot water, will overflow out of the
bathtub. As a result, this can be understood that we can regard the whole bathtub
as a riverbed, and the flow of the water in the bathtub is like the fluxion of a river
with the single faucet as a water inlet, the overflow drain as a water outlet and the
casing wall as a river bank. At the time water is added into the bathtub through the
faucet, all the other water will flow because of the interaction between water
molecules, making the water float to the outlet entirely a
