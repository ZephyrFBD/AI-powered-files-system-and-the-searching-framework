script are in the untranslated region because this is generally the site for
ribosome binding. Without this region, the ribosome couldn’t bind, and there would be no translation.
33. A
Before the transcripts are completed and leave the nucleus, they undergo certain modifications including the
removal of introns and the addition of a 5′ GTP cap and a 3′ poly-A tail. The transcript in the nucleus would
not have undergone these modifications yet, so it would contain introns.
34. B
The coding strand is the strand that is identical to the mRNA transcript, except that the mRNA has the
nucleotide uracil in place of the nucleotide thymine. It is the partner strand to the coding strand and used as a
template during transcription. Therefore, the answer should match the transcript shown in the image with
“U’s” in place of any “T’s.”
35. D
A transcription factor binds to DNA before RNA is created during transcription. Since this is already a map of
an RNA transcript, transcription has already happ
