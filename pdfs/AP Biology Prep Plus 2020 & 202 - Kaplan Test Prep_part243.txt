fruit was either
artificially induced to mature (AMI) or allowed to mature naturally
(NMI).
Which option produces the largest fruit, and why?

The largest fruit is produced by the Sugarloaf cultivar when
natural flowering induction is used, regardless of the
maturation approach used. This technique allows the plant
to invest maximum amounts of energy into fruit growth.
(A)
The largest fruit is produced by the Sugarloaf cultivar with
artificial flowering induction and by the Smooth Cayenne
cultivar with natural flowering induction. This technique
allows the plant to save more energy for future fruit
production.

when natural flowering induction is used, regardless of the
maturation approach used. This technique allows the plant
