rom our everyday encounters with water. The triple point of H2O falls at a rel-
atively low pressure, 0.00603 atm. Below this pressure, liquid water is not stable and 
ice sublimes to water vapor on heating. This property of water is used to “freeze-dry” 
foods and beverages. The food or beverage is frozen to a temperature below 0 °C. Next 
it is placed in a low-pressure chamber (below 0.00603 atm) and then warmed so that 
the water sublimes, leaving behind dehydrated food or beverage.
The phase diagram for CO2 is shown in Figure 11.29. The melting curve (blue line) 
behaves typically, slanting to the right with increasing pressure, telling us that the 
melting point of CO2 increases with increasing pressure. Because the pressure at the
