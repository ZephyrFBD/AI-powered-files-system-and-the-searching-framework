om is always greater than its ﬁrst ionization 
energy. (d) The third ionization energy is the energy needed 
to ionize three electrons from a neutral atom.
 7.41  (a) What is the general relationship between the size of an 
atom and its first ionization energy? (b) Which element in 
the periodic table has the largest ionization energy? Which 
has the smallest?
 7.42  (a) What is the trend in ﬁrst ionization energies as one pro-
ceeds down the group 7A elements? Explain how this trend 
relates to the variation in atomic radii. (b) What is the trend 
in ﬁrst ionization energies as one moves across the fourth 
period from K to Kr? How does this trend compare with the 
trend in atomic radii?
 7.43  Based on their positions in the periodic table, predict which 
atom of the following pairs will have the smaller first ioniza-
tion energy: (a) Cl, Ar; (b) Be, Ca; (c) K, Co; (d) S, Ge; (e) Sn, Te.
 7.44  For each of the following pairs, indicate which element has 
the smaller ﬁrst ionization en
