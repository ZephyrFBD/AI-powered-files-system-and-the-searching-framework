ncy of the carrier signal is made 
to change in proportion to the audio signal’s
amplitude. This method is used by FM radio 
and television.
The mixing of the audio and carrier frequencies is done in two ways. In
amplitude modulation (AM), the amplitude of the high-frequency carrier wave 
is made to vary in proportion to the amplitude of the audio signal, as shown in 
Fig.22–14. It is called “amplitude modulation” because the amplitude of the car-
rier is altered (“modulate”means to change or alter). In frequency modulation (FM),
the frequency of the carrier wave is made to change in proportion to the audio
signal’s amplitude, as shown in Fig. 22–15. The mixed signal is amplified further
and sent to the transmitting antenna (Fig. 22–13), where the complex mixture 
of frequencies is sent out in the form of EM waves. In digital communication,
the signal is put into digital form (Section 17–10) which modulates the carrier.
A television transmitter works in a similar way, using FM for audi
