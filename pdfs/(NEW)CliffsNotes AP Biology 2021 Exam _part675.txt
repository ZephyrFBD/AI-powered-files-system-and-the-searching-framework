i with the roots of plants. Plants provide carbohydrates to
the fungus, and the filaments of the fungus increase the surface area of the roots, facilitating the absorption of water
and minerals, especially phosphorus. Mycorrhizae are common; they form with most flowering plants and some
conifers, ferns, and mosses.
2. In commensalism, one species benefits, while the second species is neither helped nor harmed (+, 0).
 
Many birds build their nests in trees. Generally, the tree is neither helped nor harmed by the presence of the nests.
Egrets gather around cattle. The birds benefit because they eat the insects aroused by the grazing cattle. The cattle,
however, are neither helped nor harmed.
