aqueous HBr. The solution that remains is still acidic. It is 
then titrated with 0.500 M NaOH solution, and it takes 88.5 
mL of the NaOH solution to reach the equivalence point. 
What mass of Zn1OH22 was added to the HBr solution?
35.0 g Zn
42.0 g Cu
6.55 mL Hg
150 mL of 0.750 M AgNO3(aq)
150 mL of 3.00 M HNO3(aq)

 4.105 Suppose you have 5.00 g of powdered magnesium metal, 
1.00 L of 2.00 M potassium nitrate solution, and 1.00 L of 
2.00 M silver nitrate solution. (a) Which one of the solutions 
will react with the magnesium powder? (b) What is the net 
ionic equation that describes this reaction? (c) What volume 
of solution is needed to completely react with the magne-
sium? (d) What is the molarity of the Mg2+ ions in the result-
ing solution?
