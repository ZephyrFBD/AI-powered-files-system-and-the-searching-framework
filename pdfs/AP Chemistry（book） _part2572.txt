▲ Figure 16.13 The structure of citric acid.
The solubility of CO2 in water at 25 °C and 0.1 atm is 0.0037 M. The common practice is to assume that all the dissolved CO2 is 
in the form of carbonic acid 1H2CO32, which is produced in the reaction
CO21aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ H2CO31aq2
What is the pH of a 0.0037 M solution of H2CO3?
Analyze We are asked to determine the pH of a 0.0037 M solution 
of a polyprotic acid.
SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 16.14 
Calculating the pH of a Solution of a Polyprotic Acid
Plan H2CO3 is a diprotic acid; the two acid-dissociation constants, 
Ka1 and Ka2 (Table 16.3), differ by more than a factor of 103. Con-
sequently, the pH can be determined by considering only Ka1,
