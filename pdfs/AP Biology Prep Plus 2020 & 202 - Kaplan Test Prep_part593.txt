communicate their relative position. The
concentration of morphogens tells cells the proximity of the cell releasing
the signal and determines the spatial organization of tissues and organs.
Cells exposed to higher concentrations of morphogen will develop
diﬀerently than cells exposed to lower concentrations of morphogen. Hox
genes (homeotic genes), which are also involved in pattern formation,
control the development of appendages like antennae and legs. When one
of the Hox genes is mutated, the wrong body part forms.

Fertilization, the first step in embryonic development, is the
fusion of one sperm with one egg (gametes) to produce a
zygote that becomes a fully formed organism.

In gene regulation, negative control occurs when a repressor
switches genes oﬀ by inhibiting transcription, while positive
control occurs when an activator switches genes on by
promoting transcription. Inducers are molecules that bind to
repress
