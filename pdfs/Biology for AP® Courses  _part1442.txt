e number of complete sets of chromosomes. They are caused by nondisjunction, which occurs when pairs of homologous
chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis. Misaligned or incomplete synapsis, or a dysfunction of
the spindle apparatus that facilitates chromosome migration, can cause nondisjunction. The risk of nondisjunction occurring
increases with the age of the parents.
Nondisjunction can occur during either meiosis I or II, with differing results (Figure 13.6). If homologous chromosomes
fail to separate during meiosis I, the result is two gametes that lack that particular chromosome and two gametes with two
copies of the chromosome. If sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis II, the result is one gamete that lacks that
chromosome, two normal gametes with one copy of the chromosome, and one gamete with two copies of the chromosome.
