l Knowledge
1.C.3: Populations of organisms continue to evolve. 
Science Practice
5.3: The student can evaluate the evidence provided by 
data sets in relation to a particular scientific question.
Learning Objective 
1.26: The student is able to evaluate given data sets that 
illustrate evolution as an ongoing process.
(A)
This option is correct. It demonstrates understanding of evolution through 
natural selection and explains the relationship between changes in genotype, 
phenotype, and environment. During the drought period, plants with thick-
walled seeds were favored; in turn, finches with larger beaks that could crack 
the seeds to obtain nourishment were selected for, thus increasing chances  
for survival.
(B)
This option is incorrect. There are no data to support this conclusion that draws a 
correlation between beak size and predatory behavior.
(C)
This option is incorrect. There are no data to support this conclusion that draws a 
correlation between beak size and flight mus
