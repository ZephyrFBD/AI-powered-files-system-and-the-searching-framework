rce on
an electron traveling 
horizontally to the east
in a vertically upward magnetic field of strength 0.45 T.
10. (I) An electron is projected vertically upward with a speed
of 
into a uniform magnetic field of 0.640 T
that is directed horizontally away from the observer.
Describe the electron’s path in this field.
11. (I) Alpha particles (charge
, mass
)
move at 
What magnetic field strength
would be required to bend them into a circular path of
radius
12. (I) Find the direction of the force on a negative charge for
each diagram shown in Fig. 20–52, where 
(green) is the
velocity of the charge and 
(blue) is the direction of the
magnetic field. (
means the vector points inward.
means
it points outward, toward you.)
