 sucrose. (ENE-2)
(C) Signal transduction pathways are highly specific and regulated.
Their similarity across different kingdoms speaks to a common
ancestry. Receptors that stimulate signal transduction pathways are
located both on the surface of the membrane, as well as within the
cytoplasm. (IST-3)
(B) The key word is “initiates.” The first thing that must happen
before transduction can occur or before a response can result is that
a receptor must be activated. (IST-3)
(B) Hydrophobic molecules (acting as the first messenger) bind with
receptors on the surface of cell membranes. Once activated, the

receptor catalyzes a reaction within the cytoplasm to produce cAMP,
a common second messenger. The presence of cAMP in the
cytoplasm leads to a cascade effect that ultimately causes a response
in the cytoplasm or nucleus. (IST-3)
(D) Hydrophobic signaling molecules dissolve through the plasma
membrane and bind with a receptor in the
