Why must scientists distinguish between homologous and analogous characteristics before building phylogenetic
trees? Do more closely related organisms share homologous or analogous traits? Which type of trait is used to support
convergent or divergent evolution?
20.3 | Perspectives on the Phylogenetic Tree
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What is horizontal gene transfer and its significance in constructing phylogenetic trees?
•
How do prokaryotes and eukaryotes transfer genes horizontally?
•
What are other models of phylogenetic relationships and how do they differ from the original phylogenetic tree
concept?

Newer technologies have uncovered surprising discoveries with unexpected relationships among organisms, such as the fact
that humans seems to be more closely related to fungi than fungi are to plants. (Think about that the next time you see a
