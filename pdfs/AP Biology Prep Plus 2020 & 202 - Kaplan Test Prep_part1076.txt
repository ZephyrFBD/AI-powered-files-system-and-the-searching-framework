Linked genes violate the law of independent assortment, which states individual traits assort independently
during gamete production.
Multiple genes violate the law of segregation, which states the oﬀspring receives one allele for a trait from each
parent.  
Co-dominance or incomplete dominance violate the law of dominance, which states
