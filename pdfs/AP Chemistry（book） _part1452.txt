(rule 1).
The Li 1s orbitals combine to form s
1s and s
1s
*  bonding and antibonding MOs, as they 
did for H2. The 2s orbitals interact with one another in exactly the same way, producing 
bonding 1s
2s2 and antibonding 1s
2s
*2 MOs. In general, the separation between bonding 
and antibonding MOs depends on the extent to which the constituent atomic orbitals 
overlap. Because the Li 2s orbitals extend farther from the nucleus than the 1s orbitals do, 
the 2s orbitals overlap more effectively. As a result, the energy difference between the s
2s 
and s
2s
* orbitals is greater than the energy difference between the s
1s and s
1s
*  orbitals. The 
1s orbitals of Li are much lower in energy than the 2s orbitals; therefore, the energy of the 
s
1s
*  antibonding MO is much lower than the energy of the s
2s bonding MO.
Each Li atom has three electrons, so six electrons must be placed in Li2 MOs. As 
shown in Figure 9.35, these electrons occupy the s
1s, s1s
* , and s
2s MOs, each with two
