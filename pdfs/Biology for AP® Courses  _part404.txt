Figure 4.3 (a) These Salmonella bacteria appear as tiny purple dots when viewed with a light microscope. (b) This
scanning electron microscope micrograph shows Salmonella bacteria (in red) invading human cells (yellow). Even
though subfigure (b) shows a different Salmonella specimen than subfigure (a), you can still observe the comparative
increase in magnification and detail. (credit a: modification of work by CDC/Armed Forces Institute of Pathology,
