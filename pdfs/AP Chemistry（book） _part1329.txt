 substance XY, formed from two 
different elements, boils at -33 Â°C. Is XY likely to be a cova-
lent or an ionic substance?
 8.32 Which of these elements are unlikely to form covalent 
bonds? S, H, K, Ar, Si.
 8.33 Using Lewis symbols and Lewis structures, diagram the for-
mation of SiCl4 from Si and Cl atoms, showing valence-shell 
electrons. (a) How many valence electrons does Si have ini-
tially? (b) How many valence electrons does each Cl have 
initially? (c) How many valence electrons surround the Si 
in the SiCl4 molecule? (d) How many valence electrons sur-
round each Cl in the SiCl4 molecule? (e) How many bonding 
pairs of electrons are in the SiCl4 molecule?
 8.34 Use Lewis symbols and Lewis structures to diagram the for-
mation of PF3 from P and F atoms, showing valence-shell 
electrons. (a) How many valence electrons does P have ini-
tially? (b) How many valence electrons does each F have 
initially? (c) How many valence electrons surround the P in 
the PF3 molecule? (d) How
