Electromagnetic Waves
38. (I) The variable capacitor in the tuner of an AM radio has a
capacitance of 2500 pF when the radio is tuned to a station
at 550 kHz. What must the capacitance be for a station near
the other end of the dial, 1610 kHz?
39. (I) The oscillator of a 98.3-MHz FM station has an induc-
tance of 
What value must the capacitance be?
40. (II) A certain FM radio tuning circuit has a fixed capacitor
Tuning is done by a variable inductance. What
range of values must the inductance have to tune stations
from 88 MHz to 108 MHz?
41. (II) An amateur radio operator wishes to build a receiver that
can tune a range from 14.0 MHz to 15.0 MHz. A variable
capacitor has a minimum capacitance of 86 pF. (a) What 
is the required value of the inductance? (b) What is the 
maximum capacitance used on the variable capacitor?
42. (II) A satellite beams microwave radiation with a power of
13 kW
