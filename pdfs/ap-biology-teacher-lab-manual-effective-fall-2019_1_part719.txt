■ Option 1: Potometer with or Without Gas Pressure Sensor 
Materials 
•  Representative plant species available 
in your region/season, such as  
Impatiens (a moisture-loving plant), 
Coleus, 
 oleander (more drought toler-
ant), Phaseolus vulgaris (bean seed-
lings), pea plants, varieties of Lycoper-
sicon (tomato), peppers, and ferns 
• Potometer, which you assemble from  
clear plastic tubing, a ring stand with 
clamp, and a 0.1-mL or 1.0-mL pipette, 
depending on the diameter of the stem 
of the plant you choose. Your teacher 
will have several different sizes of 
plastic tubing available. (The tubing 
can be filled using a water bottle or 
plastic syringe without a needle.) If 
using a syringe, attach it to the end 
of the pipette and pull water into the 
potomete
