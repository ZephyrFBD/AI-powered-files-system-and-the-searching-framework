n is faster when solute weight is smaller. All molecules at the same temperature have the same
average kinetic
 
energy, but because kinetic energy equals ½ × mass × velocity2, lighter
 
molecules move faster.
By measuring the weights of the dialysis bags before and after immersion into the solutions, you are able to
determine the direction of osmosis, the movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane. But how do
you know if the solutes were able to pass across the membrane? Several qualitative tests can be used to determine
the presence of the solutes inside and outside of the dialysis bags:
1. A commercial glucose testing tape can be used to test for the presence of glucose.
 
2. A Benedict’s test can be used to test for the presence of glucose or fructose.
3. A biuret test can be used to test for the presence of proteins.
4. A flame test can be used to test for the presence of sodium.
5. Lugol’s solution can be used to test for the presence of starch. Lugol’s solution (i
