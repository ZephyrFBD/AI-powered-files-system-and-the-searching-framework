Standard Temperature Scale
Different materials do not expand in quite the same way over a wide temperature
range. Consequently, if we calibrate different kinds of thermometers exactly as
described above, they will not usually agree precisely.
Because of such discrepancies, some standard kind of thermometer must be
chosen so that all temperatures can be precisely defined. The chosen standard for
this purpose is the constant-volume gas thermometer. As shown in the simplified
diagram of Fig. 13–8, this thermometer consists of a bulb filled with a low-
pressure gas connected by a thin tube to a mercury manometer (Section 10–6).
The volume of the gas is kept constant by raising or lowering the right-hand tube
of the manometer so that the mercury in the left-hand tube coincides with the
reference mark. An increase in temperature causes a proportional increase in
pressure in the bulb. Thus the tube must be lifted higher to keep the gas volume
constant. The height of the merc
