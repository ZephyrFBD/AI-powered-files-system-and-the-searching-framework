Females need two mutated X chromosomes to not be hemophilic.
Lethality
A large proportion of genes in an individualâ€™s genome are essential for survival. Occasionally, a nonfunctional allele for an
essential gene can arise by mutation and be transmitted in a population as long as individuals with this allele also have a
wild-type, functional copy. The wild-type allele functions at a capacity sufficient to sustain life and is therefore considered
to be dominant over the nonfunctional allele. However, consider two heterozygous parents that have a genotype of wild-
type/nonfunctional mutant for a hypothetical essential gene. In one quarter of their offspring, we would expect to observe
individuals that are homozygous recessive for the nonfunctional allele. Because the gene is essential, these individuals
might fail to develop past fertilization, die in utero, or die later in life, depending on what life stage requires this gene. An
inheritance pattern in which an
