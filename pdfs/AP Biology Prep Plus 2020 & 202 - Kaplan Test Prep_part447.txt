ghter cells
would inherit an incomplete set of chromosomes.
(C)
The two G phases must be exactly the same length to ensure
that the cell cycle repeats at perfectly even intervals, as the
cell cannot control the cell cycle except by dividing at very
consistent intervals of time.
(D)
2. A cell culture is treated with a drug that eﬀectively prevents DNA
synthesis, but which aﬀects no other process in the cell. How
would the administration of this drug aﬀect mitosis in a culture of
otherwise healthy adult epithelial cells?
It would not aﬀect the cells because each cell already has two
copies of the whole genome, which is enough to allow for
division.
(A)
It would not aﬀect the cells because cells cease to divide once
an organism reaches its full size at adulthood.
(B)
It would aﬀect the cells because they would still be able to
divide once but would end up with only half the ordinary
amount of DNA.
(C)
It would aﬀect the cells because they would not progress
beyond the synthesis phase of t
