r to estimate
the age of the earth, a process known as radiometric dating. Radioisotopes
(radioactive isotopes) are useful in many other ways. For example,
radioactive iodine (I-131) can be used both to diagnose and to treat
certain diseases of the thyroid gland. Additionally, a tracer such as
radioactive carbon can be incorporated into a molecule and used to trace
the path of carbon dioxide in a metabolic pathway.
BONDING
A bond is formed when two atomic nuclei attract the same electron(s).
Energy is released when a bond is formed because atoms acquire a more
stable configuration by completing their outer shell. Energy must be
supplied to break a bond. There are two main types of bonds: ionic and

covalent.
REMEMBER
Bond formation releases energy.
Ionic bonds result from the transfer of electrons. An atom that gains
electrons becomes an anion (a negative ion). An atom that loses an
electron becomes a cation, a positive ion. The Na+, Ca++, an
