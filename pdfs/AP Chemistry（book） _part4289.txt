 process. (Section 13.2)
cubic close packing A crystal structure where the atoms are 
packed together as close as possible, and the close-packed layers 
of atoms adopt a three-layer repeating pattern that leads to a 
face-centered cubic unit cell. (Section 12.3)
curie A measure of radioactivity: 1 curie = 3.7 * 1010 nuclear 
disintegrations per second. (Section 21.4)
cycloalkanes Saturated hydrocarbons of general formula CnH2n in 
which the carbon atoms form a closed ring. (Section 24.2)
Dalton’s law of partial pressures A law stating that the total 
pressure of a mixture of gases is the sum of the pressures that 
each gas would exert if it were present alone. (Section 10.6)
d–d transition The transition of an electron in a transition-metal 
compound from a lower-energy d orbital to a higher-energy d 
orbital. (Section 23.6)
decomposition reaction A chemical reaction in which a single 
compound reacts to give two or more products. (Section 3.2)
degenerate A situation in which two or mo
