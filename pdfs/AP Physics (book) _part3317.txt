o conduct when the wavelength of
the light is 620 nm. Estimate the energy gap 
18. (I) Calculate the longest-wavelength photon that can cause
an electron in silicon 
to jump from the
valence band to the conduction band.
19. (II) The energy gap between valence and conduction bands
in germanium is 0.72 eV. What range of wavelengths can a
photon have to excite an electron from the top of the valence
band into the conduction band?
20. (II) The band gap of silicon is 1.12 eV. (a) For what 
range of wavelengths will silicon be transparent? (See
Example 29â€“5.) In what region of the electromagnetic
spectrum does this transparent range begin? (b) If window
glass is transparent for all visible wavelengths, what is the
minimum possible band gap value for glass (assume
[Hint: If the photon has less
energy than the band gap, the photon will pass through the
solid without being absorbed.]
21. (II) The energy gap 
in germanium is 0.72 eV. When
used as a photon detector, roughly how many electrons
can
