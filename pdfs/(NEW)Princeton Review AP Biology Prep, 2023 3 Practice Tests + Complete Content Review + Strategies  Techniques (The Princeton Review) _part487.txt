le, suppose data was collected from 100 families with three children each. Fourteen families had three
female children, 36 families had two females and a male, 30 families had one female and two males, and 20 families
had three male children. We would expect offspring sex to segregate independently. In other words, the sex of a
given child shouldn’t be affected by the sex of previous children. Let’s test whether this is true for this dataset.
Since we expect sex to segregate independently, this is the null hypothesis (H0). Each family has three children, so
there are four possible outcomes for each family:
1. three daughters
2. two daughters and a son
3. one daughter and two sons
4. three sons
Using some advanced math (that you don’t need to worry about), the probabilities for each of these is:
1. P(three females) = 12.5%
2. P(two females, one male) = 37.5%
3. P(one female, two males) = 37.5%
4. P(three males) = (1)(0.50)3 = 12.5%
Because there are 100 families, we expect 12.5 to have
