41. Why is the transmission of a prion not reliant upon
genes made of DNA or RNA?
a.
DNA or RNA, though present, is not transmitted
when a prion causes infection.
b.
The prion does not contain DNA or RNA.
c.
Only parts of DNA or RNA are transmitted in a
prion.
d.
More of protein and less of DNA or RNA is
transmitted.

42. The table below shows the Baltimore Classification
used to classify viruses based on their genetic material.
What is the difference between how Group I and Group III
viruses reproduce?
a.
In Group I, RNA is transcribed from an RNA
genome while in Group III, RNA is transcribed
from a DNA genome.
b.
In Group I, RNA is transcribed from a DNA
genome while in Group III, RNA is transcribed
from an RNA genome.
c.
In Group I, DNA is transcribed from a DNA
genome while in Group III, RNA is transcribed
from an RNA genome.
d.
In Group I, DNA is transcribed from an RNA
genome while in Group III, RNA is transcribed
from a DNA g
