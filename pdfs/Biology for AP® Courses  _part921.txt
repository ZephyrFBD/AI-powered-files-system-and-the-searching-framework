es place in leaves, which consist of several layers of cells. The process of
photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll. The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs
through small, regulated openings called stomata (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange
and water balance. The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss. Each
stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to
osmotic changes.
In all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast. For plants, chloroplast-
containing cells exist in the mesophyll. Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope (composed of an outer membrane
and an inner membrane). Within the chloroplast are stacked, disc-shaped structures called thylakoids. Embedded in the
thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll, a pigment (molecule tha
