roteins found in membranes are:
Integral Proteins—transmembrane proteins with hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions
Peripheral Proteins—bind to integral proteins on the outside of the cell membrane
ii. Functions of membrane proteins include:
transport
enzymatic activity
signal transduction and cell communication
II.
Cell Membrane Transport
A. Cell Size is limited by the surface area-to-volume ratio. Cells need a high surface area-to-volume ratio to
efficiently exchange materials with the environment.
1. As cells increase in size (volume) the surface area-to-volume ratio decreases as the demand for
materials to be imported and exported from the cell increases.
2. To make exchange more efficient, membrane folds might be present to make more surface area for
exchange of materials.
B. There are two main types of cellular transport: passive transport and active transport.
1. Passive transport does not require the cell to use ATP energy and plays a role in both the import of
resources and the
