he moths with
darker wings had a survival advantage during the Industrial Revolution and became more prevalent in the population
due to natural selection. When the environment changed in the second half of the 20th century, the moths with
darker wings no longer had an advantage, so the moths with lighter wings then became more common.
According to the theory of natural selection, the environment selects for individuals with phenotypes that confer
a survival advantage in that environment. If the environment changes, different phenotypes may confer an
advantage, and the changing environment can change the direction of evolution, as was seen in the peppered moths
example.
Remember, evolution is the result of changes in a population over multiple generations. Individuals with characteristics that provide a
survival advantage are more likely to survive and reproduce than individuals without those characteristics. With each generation, the
proportion of the population with characteristics th
