 of the s orbital electrons to the nucleus as we move 
left to right across the periodic table. In other words, in each period the 
d electrons become more corelike as the atomic number increases. By 
the time we get to zinc, it is not possible to remove electrons from the 
3d orbitals through chemical oxidation.
In the transition metals of periods 5 and 6, the increased size of the 
4d and 5d orbitals makes it possible to attain maximum oxidation states 
as high as +8, which is achieved in RuO4 and OsO4. In general, the max-
imum oxidation states are found only when the metals are combined 
with the most electronegative elements, especially O, F, and in some 
cases Cl.
