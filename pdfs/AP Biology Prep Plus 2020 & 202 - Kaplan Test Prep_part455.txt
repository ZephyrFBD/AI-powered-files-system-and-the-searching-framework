 called the metaphase plate.
Anaphase
In anaphase, paired sister chromatids separate as kinetochore
microtubules shorten rapidly. The polar microtubules lengthen as the
kinetochore microtubules shorten, thereby pushing the poles of the cell
farther apart.
Telophase
During telophase, separated sister chromatids group at opposite ends of
the cell, near the centrosome region, having been pulled there by the
receding microtubules. A new nuclear envelope forms around each group
of separated chromosomes. At this point, mitosis has ended.
Cytokinesis
In cytokinesis, the contractile ring of actin protein fibers shortens at the
center of the cell. A cleavage furrow, or indentation, is created as the ring
contracts. As one side of the cell contacts the other, the membrane
pinches oﬀ and two cells exist where one did before.
Meiosis
Meiosis is the process that sexually reproducing organisms use to
generate gametes, haploid cells that combine (usually with gametes
from another member of the same s
