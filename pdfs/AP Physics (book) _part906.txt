92. The Moon orbits the Earth such that the same side always
faces the Earth. Determine the ratio of the Moon’s spin
angular momentum (about its own axis) to its orbital angu-
lar momentum. (In the latter case, treat the Moon as a
particle orbiting the Earth.)
93. A spherical asteroid with radius 
and mass
rotates about an axis at four revolu-
tions per day. A “tug” spaceship
attaches itself to the asteroid’s
south pole (as defined by the
axis of rotation) and fires
its engine, applying a
force F tangentially to
the asteroid’s surface as
shown in Fig. 8–65. If
how long
will it take the tug to
rotate 
the 
asteroid’s
axis of rotation through
an angle of 5.0° by this
method?
