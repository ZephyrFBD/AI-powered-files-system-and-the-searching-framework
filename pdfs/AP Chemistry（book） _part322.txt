Three Cl- ions are required to balance the charge of  
one Al3+ ion, making the empirical  
formula AlCl3.
(b)  
Two Al3+ ions are required to balance the charge of  
three O2- ions. A 2:3 ratio is needed to balance the total  
positive charge of 6+  and the total negative charge of 6-.  
The  
empirical formula is Al2O3.
(c)  
Two NO3
- ions are needed to balance the charge of one  
Mg2+, yielding Mg1NO322. Note that the formula for the  
polyatomic ion, NO3
-, must be enclosed in parentheses so 
that it is clear that the subscript 2 applies to all the atoms  
of that ion.

2.8 ∣ Naming Inorganic Compounds
The names and chemical formulas of compounds are essential vocabulary in chemistry. 
The system used in naming substances is called chemical nomenclature, from the 
Latin words nomen (name) and calare (to call).
There are more than 50 million known chemical substances. Naming them all 
would be a hopelessly complicated task if each had
