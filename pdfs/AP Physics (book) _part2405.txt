5. (II) An 18.5-cm-diameter loop of wire is initially oriented
perpendicular to a 1.5-T magnetic field. The loop is rotated
so that its plane is parallel to the field direction in 0.20 s.
What is the average induced emf in the loop?
6. (II) A fixed 10.8-cm-diameter wire coil is perpendicular to
a magnetic field 0.48 T pointing up. In 0.16 s, the field is
changed to 0.25 T pointing down. What is the average
induced emf in the coil?
7. (II) A 16-cm-diameter circular loop of wire is placed in a
0.50-T magnetic field. (a) When the plane of the loop is
perpendicular to the field
