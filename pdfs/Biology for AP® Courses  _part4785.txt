 to Africa and may have been spread throughout the world by transport of a commonly used laboratory
and pet species: the African clawed toad (Xenopus laevis). It may well be that biologists themselves are responsible for
spreading this disease worldwide. The North American bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, which has also been widely introduced
as a food animal but which easily escapes captivity, survives most infections of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and can
act as a reservoir for the disease.

Early evidence suggests that another fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, introduced from Europe is
responsible for white-nose syndrome, which infects cave-hibernating bats in eastern North America and has spread from
a point of origin in western New York State (Figure 38.
