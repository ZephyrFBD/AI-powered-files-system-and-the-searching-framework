ides are strong acids in water. In general, as the H—A bond strength 
decreases, the stronger the acid.
t Conjugate Base Stability A third factor that affects the ease with which a hy-
drogen atom ionizes from HA is the stability of the conjugate base, A-. In general, the 
greater the stability of the conjugate base, the stronger the acid.
Binary Acids
For a series of binary acids HA in which A represents members of the same group in the 
periodic table, the strength of the H¬A bond is generally the most important factor 
determining acid strength. The strength of an H¬A bond tends to decrease as the ele-
ment A increases in size. As a result, the bond strength decreases and acidity increases 
down a group. Thus, HCl is a stronger acid than HF, and H2S is a stronger acid than H2O.
Bond polarity is the major factor determining acidity for binary acids HA when A 
represents members of the same period. Thus, acidity increases as the electronegativity 
of the element A increases, as it ge
