45. (I) A space shuttle releases a satellite into a circular orbit
780 km above the Earth. How fast must the shuttle be
moving (relative to Earth’s center) when the release occurs?
46. (I) Calculate the speed of a satellite moving in a stable 
circular orbit about the Earth at a height of 4800 km.
47. (II) You know your mass is 62 kg, but when you stand on a
bathroom scale in an elevator, it says your mass is 77 kg.
What is the acceleration of the elevator, and in which
direction?
48. (II) A 12.0-kg monkey hangs from a cord suspended from
the ceiling of an elevator. The cord can withstand a tension
of 185 N and breaks as the elevator accelerates. What 
was the elevator’s minimum acceleration (magnitude and
direction)?
49. (II) Calculate the period of a satellite orbiting the Moon,
95 km above the Moon’s surface. Ignore effects of the
Earth. The radius of the Moon is 1740 km.
50. (II) Two satellites orbit Earth at altitudes of 7500 km and
15,000 km above the Earth’s surfac
