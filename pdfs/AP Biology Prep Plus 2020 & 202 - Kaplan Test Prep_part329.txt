1. D
Learning Objective: 8.1
According to the diagrams, the same transducing cascade is employed
in both skeletal and smooth muscles, up until the point when protein
kinase A is activated. In skeletal muscles, it leads to the breakdown of
glycogen, while in smooth muscles, it causes less interaction between
myosin and actin. Thus, protein kinase A has diﬀerent targets in the
two muscle types, making (D) correct. (A) is incorrect because
epinephrine attaches to the β2 adrenergic receptor in both skeletal and
smooth muscles. (B) is incorrect because cAMP is the second
messenger in both types of muscles. (C) is incorrect because glycogen
metabolism is not aﬀected in smooth muscle.
2. B
Learning Objective: 8.2
Cells in the late stage of growth secrete a signal molecule in the
medium. If the hypothesis is correct, a supernatant conditioned by
these cells would induce quorum sensing in cells that have not yet
reached high density. Thus, (B) presents the most
