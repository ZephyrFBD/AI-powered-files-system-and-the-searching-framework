. Metal atoms have relatively
loosely held outer electrons. Metallic bond theories propose that in a metallic
solid, these outer electrons roam rather freely among all the metal atoms which,
without their outer electrons, act like positive ions. According to the theory, the
electrostatic attraction between the metal ions and this negative electron “gas” is
responsible, at least in part, for holding the solid together. The binding energy of
metal bonds is typically 1 to 3 eV, somewhat weaker than ionic or covalent bonds
(5 to 10 eV in solids). The “free electrons” are responsible for the high electrical
and thermal conductivity of metals. This theory also nicely accounts for the
shininess of smooth metal surfaces: the free electrons can vibrate at any frequency,
so when light of a range of frequencies falls on a metal, the electrons can vibrate
in response and re-emit light of those same frequencies. Hence, the reflected
light will consist largely of the same frequencies as the incident
