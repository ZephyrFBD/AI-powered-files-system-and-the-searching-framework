 Design an ammeter to read 1.0 A at
full scale using a galvanometer with a full-scale sensitivity of 
and a
resistance
Check if the scale is linear.
APPROACH Only 
of the 1.0-A current passes
through the galvanometer to give full-scale deflection. The rest of the current
passes through the small shunt resistor,
Fig. 19–31. The
potential difference across the galvanometer equals that across the shunt
resistor (they are in parallel). We apply Ohm’s law to find 
SOLUTION Because 
when
flows into the meter, we
want 
through the shunt resistor to be 
The potential differ-
ence across the shunt is the same as across the galvanometer, so
Then
or 
The shunt resistor must thus have a very low resistance and most of
the current passes through it.
Because 
and 
is constant, we see that the scale is 
linear (needle deflection is proportional to 
). If the current 
into the 
meter is half of full scale, 0.50 A, the current to the galvanometer will be
which would make
the needle deflect halfway, as
