ew millimeters thick alternate with light-colored and
iron-poor shale or chert. Hematite and magnetite can form
precipitates from water that has a high concentration of
dissolved oxygen. Shale and chert can form under
conditions that have high concentrations of carbonates
(CO3-2). These banded iron formations appeared 3.7
billion years ago (and became less common 1.8 billion
years ago). Justify the claim that these sedimentary rock
formations reveal early Earth conditions.
48. The following diagram summarizes the light reactions
of photosynthesis.
Figure 8.22
The diagram shows light-dependent reactions of
photosynthesis, including the reaction centers, electron
transport chains, and the overall reactions within each of
these. The free energy per electron is shown for the
oxidation-reduction reactions. The free change of the
captured radiant energy is shown.
