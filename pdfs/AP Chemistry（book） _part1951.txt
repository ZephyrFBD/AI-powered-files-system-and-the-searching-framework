t consists of 
C60 and a related molecule, C70, which has a more elongated structure. The carbon-rich 
gases from which C60 and C70 condense also contain other fullerenes, mostly containing 
more carbon atoms, such as C76 and C84. The smallest possible fullerene, C20, was first 
detected in 2000. This small, ball-shaped molecule is much more reactive than the larger 
fullerenes. Because fullerenes are molecules, they dissolve in various organic solvents, 
whereas diamond and graphite do not. This solubility permits fullerenes to be separated 
from the other components of soot and even from one another. It also allows the study 
of their reactions in solution.
