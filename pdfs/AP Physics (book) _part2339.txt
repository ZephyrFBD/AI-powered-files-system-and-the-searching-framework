FIGURE 21–24 A dc voltage turned
on and off as shown in (a) produces
voltage pulses in the secondary (b).
Voltage scales in (a) and (b) are not
the same.
If the secondary coil contains more loops than the primary coil 
we have a step-up transformer. The secondary voltage is greater than the primary
voltage. For example, if the secondary coil has twice as many turns as the primary
coil, then the secondary voltage will be twice that of the primary voltage. If 
is
less than 
we have a step-down transformer.
Although ac voltage can be increased (or decreased) with a transformer, we
don’t get something for nothing. Energy conservation tells us that the power
output can be no greater than the power input. A well-designed transformer can
be greater than 99% efficient, so little energy is lost to heat. The power output
thus essentially equals the power input. Since power 
(Eq. 18–5), we have
