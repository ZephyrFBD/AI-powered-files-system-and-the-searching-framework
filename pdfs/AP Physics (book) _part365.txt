because the box remains
at rest  
Newton’s second law gives
We solve this equation for the normal force:
which is greater than in (a). The table pushes back with more force when a person
pushes down on the box. The normal force is not always equal to the weight!
(c) The box’s weight is still 98.0 N and acts downward. The force exerted by
your friend and the normal force both act upward (positive direction), as shown
in Fig. 4–15c. The box doesn’t move since your friend’s upward force is less 
than the weight. The net force, again set to zero in Newton’s second law because
is
so
The table does not push against the full weight of the box because of the upward
force exerted by your friend.
NOTE The weight of the box 
does not change as a result of your friend’s
push or pull. Only the normal force is affected.
Recall that the normal force is elastic in origin (the table in Fig. 4–15 sags
slightly under the weight of the box). The normal force in Example 4–6 is verti-
cal, perpendicular to
