art of the host’s genome, to become active only when exposed to radiation or
other environmental disturbance. When activated, the viral DNA begins the lytic cycle.
Some viruses are RNA retroviruses. Some of these RNA viruses produce the enzyme reverse transcriptase to first
manufacture DNA, which in turn, enters a lytic or lysogenic cycle.
b. Bacteria, unlike viruses, do not usually cause disease by direct destruction of host cells. Rather, most bacteria
cause disease by producing toxins, usually waste products of their normal metabolism. When the toxins affect the
normal metabolism of the host, disease results.
Some bacteria also cause disease by competing for the same resources as do the host cells. In other cases, the
symptoms of a disease are the result of the host’s response to invasion by foreign bodies. For example, in
pneumonia, the mucus that accumulates in the lungs is produced by the lung cells in response to the presence of the
bacteria.
