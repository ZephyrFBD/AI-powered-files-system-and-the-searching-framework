r furan? (b) How many 
valence electrons are there in the molecule? (c) What is 
the hybridization at each of the carbon atoms? (d) How 
many electrons are in the p system of the molecule? (e) The 
C ¬C ¬C bond angles in furan are much smaller than those 
in benzene. The likely reason is which of the following: (i) The 
hybridization of the carbon atoms in furan is different from 
that in benzene, (ii) Furan does not have another resonance 
structure equivalent to the one above, or (iii) The atoms in a 
five-membered ring are forced to adopt smaller angles than in 
a six-membered ring. [Section 9.5]
 9.10 The following is part of a molecular orbital energy-level dia-
gram for MOs constructed from 1s atomic orbitals.
 
 (a) What labels do we use for the two MOs shown? (b) For 
which of the following molecules or ions could this be the 
energy-level diagram:
 
 
H2, He2, H2
+, He2
+, or H2
-?
 
 (c) What is the bond order of the molecule or ion? (d) If an 
electron is added to the system
