 which consists of P4 
tetrahedra. In reaction with the halogens, phosphorus forms triha-
lides PX3 and pentahalides PX5. These compounds undergo hydroly-
sis to produce an oxyacid of phosphorus and HX.
Phosphorus forms two oxides, P4O6 and P4O10. Their corre-
sponding acids, phosphorous acid and phosphoric acid, undergo 
condensation reactions when heated. Phosphorus compounds are 
important in biochemistry and as fertilizers.
CARBON AND THE OTHER GROUP 4A ELEMENTS (SECTIONS 22.9  
AND 22.10) The allotropes of carbon include diamond, graphite, 
fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. Amorphous forms of 
graphite include charcoal and carbon black. Carbon forms two com-
mon oxides, CO and CO2. Aqueous solutions of CO2 produce the 
weak diprotic acid carbonic acid 1H2CO32, which is the parent acid 
of hydrogen carbonate and carbonate salts. Binary compounds of 
carbon are called carbides. Carbides may be ionic, interstitial, or co-
valent. Calcium carbide 1CaC22 contains the strongly
