47. (I) A person on a rocket traveling at 0.40c (with respect to
the Earth) observes a meteor come from behind and pass
her at a speed she measures as 0.40c. How fast is the
meteor moving with respect to the Earth?
48. (II) Two spaceships leave Earth in opposite directions, each
with a speed of 0.60c with respect to Earth. (a) What is the
velocity of spaceship 1 relative to spaceship 2? (b) What 
is the velocity of spaceship 2 relative to spaceship 1?
