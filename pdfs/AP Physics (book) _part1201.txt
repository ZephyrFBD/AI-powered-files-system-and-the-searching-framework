This relation shows explicitly that the intensity of a wave is proportional both to
the square of the wave amplitude A at any point and to the square of the 
frequency f.

1–10 Reflection and Transmission
of Waves
When a wave strikes an obstacle, or comes to the end of the medium in which it is
traveling, at least a part of the wave is reflected. You have probably seen water
waves reflect off a rock or the side of a swimming pool. And you may have heard
a shout reflected from a distant cliff—
