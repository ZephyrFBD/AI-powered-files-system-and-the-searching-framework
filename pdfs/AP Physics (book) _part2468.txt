l. Proposals have been made to use
the radiation pressure from the Sun to help propel spacecraft around the solar
system. (a) About how much force would be applied on a
highly
reflective sail when about the same distance from the Sun as the Earth is?
(b) By how much would this increase the speed of a 5000-kg spacecraft in one year?
(c) If the spacecraft started from rest, about how far would it travel in a year?
APPROACH (a) Pressure P is force per unit area, so
We use the estimate
of Example 22–5, doubling it for a reflecting surface 
(b) We find the
acceleration from Newton’s second law, and assume it is constant, and then find
the speed from
(c) The distance traveled is given by
SOLUTION (a) Doubling the result of Example 22–5, we get a solar pressure 
that is about 
rounding off. Then the force is 
(b) The acceleration is 
One
year has
The speed increase is
(c) Starting from rest, this acceleration would result in a distance traveled of
about 
in a year, about seven
times the Sun–E
