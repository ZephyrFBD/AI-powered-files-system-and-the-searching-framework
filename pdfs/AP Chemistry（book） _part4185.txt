H 6 7. We must consider the 3H+4 that is 
must lie on all lattice points. In an ionic compound there are at 
least two different types of atoms, and only one can lie on the lat-
tice points. page 493 Four. The empirical formula of potassium 
oxide is K2O. Rearranging Equation 12.1 we can determine the 
potassium coordination number to be anion coordination num-
ber *  (number of anions per formula unit/number of cations per 
formula unit) = 811>22 = 4. page 504 A condensation polymer. 
The presence of both ¬ COOH and  ¬NH2 groups allow molecules 
to react with one another forming C ¬ N bonds and eliminating 
H2O. page 505 As the vinyl acetate content increases more side 
chain branching occurs which inhibits the formation of crystalline 
regions thereby lowering the melting point. page 507 No. The 
emitted photons have energies that are similar in energy to the band 
gap of the semiconductor. If the size of the crystals is reduced into 
the nanometer range, the band gap will increase.
