6.4 Heat exchange between the bathtub and outside
Team#44509
Page 23 of 26
The width of most bathtubs is higher than eight centimeters, and the material of
the bathtub is usually acrylic and has good insulation effect. We find that when the
bathtub is filled with water, the temperature of the inner casing wall is the same as the
temperature of the water in the bathtub while the temperature of the outer casing wall
is the same as the temperature of the air. That is why we think the bathtub has no heat
exchange with the outside.
6.5 Calculating the time of cooling
Due to the relationship between heat flux and heat, wo can know that
