 niches of specialists are more specific and
limited.

Density and Dispersion
A. Population—group of individuals of the same species living together in the same location during the same
period of time.
B. Population characteristics include size, density, patterns of dispersion, and age structure.
1. Population size—the number of individuals in the population; can be measured by direct counting in
small populations or by sampling a portion of the population if it is larger.
2. Population density—refers to the number of individuals in a defined unit of space, such as the number
of single-cell algae per milliliter of pond water or ferns per square kilometer of forest floor.
3. Dispersion—the pattern of distribution of individuals within a population.
i.
Uniform (or even) dispersion pattern—one in which the members of the population are spaced at
relatively equal distances from one another, and often occurs in species that defend a defined
territory.
ii. Random dispersion pattern—each
