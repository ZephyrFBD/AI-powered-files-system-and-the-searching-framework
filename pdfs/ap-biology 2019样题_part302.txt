ecific data points, describe 
trends or patterns, and describe 
relationships between variables
Free-response questions 2 and 6 
focus on Science Practice 4, with 
approximately half of the points for 
each question assessing this practice.
Free-response question 1 also 
assesses this practice in one or  
two points.
5: Statistical Tests and Data Analysis
Individual and/or set-based multiple-
choice questions will assess students’ 
ability to perform statistical tests and 
mathematical calculations to analyze 
and interpret data.
Students will need to perform 
mathematical calculations, use 
confidence intervals, perform 
chi-square hypothesis testing, and 
use data to evaluate a hypothesis 
or prediction.
Free-response question 1 or 2 
assess students’ ability to perform 
a mathematical calculation. Free-
response question 6 assesses 
students’ ability to use data to 
evaluate a hypothesis or prediction.
6: Argumentation
Individual and/or set-based  
multiple-choice questions will
