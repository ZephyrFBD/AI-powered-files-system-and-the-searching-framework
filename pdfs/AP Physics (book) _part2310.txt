make up for the flux decrease.
(c) Magnetic field lines point into the S pole of a magnet, so as the magnet
moves toward us and the loop, the magnet’s field points into the page and is
getting stronger. The current in the loop will be induced in the counterclock-
wise direction in order to produce a field 
out of the page.
(d) The field is in the plane of the loop, so no magnetic field lines pass through
the loop and the flux through the loop is zero throughout the process; hence
there is no change in flux and no induced emf or current in the loop.
(e) Initially there is no flux through the loop. When you start to rotate the loop,
the external field through the loop begins increasing to the left. To counteract
this change in flux, the loop will have current induced in a counterclockwise
direction so as to produce its own field to the right.
