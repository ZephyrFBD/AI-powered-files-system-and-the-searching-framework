 a framework for adding new species.
However, as already noted, at the present rate of description of new species, it will take close to 500 years before the
complete catalog of life is known. Many, perhaps most, species on the planet do not have that much time.
There is also the problem of understanding which species known to science are threatened and to what degree they are
threatened. This task is carried out by the non-profit IUCN which, as previously mentioned, maintains the Red Listâ€”an
online listing of endangered species categorized by taxonomy, type of threat, and other criteria (Figure 38.17). The Red List
is supported by scientific research. In 2011, the list contained 61,000 species, all with supporting documentation.
