NA would not affect the individuals as the
proteins made are finally altered and modified.
RNA would cause harm to the person as the
RNA is encoded by the DNA and is not altered.
c.
DNA is the genetic material and is transferred
from one generation to another making use of
repair mechanisms for every mutation. The RNA
does not use a repair mechanism.
d.
DNA, when mutated, makes use of the repair
mechanisms and can be repaired whereas RNA
is not repaired and is transferred in generations.

75. The capture of radiant energy through the conversion
of carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates is the
engine that drives life on Earth. Ribose, C5H10O5, and
hexose, C6H12O6, form stable five- and six-carbon rings.
Figure 3.37
The numbering of the carbons on these rings is important
in organizing our description of the role these molecules
play in biological energy transfer and information storage
and retrieval. Glycolysis is a sequence of chemical
reactions
