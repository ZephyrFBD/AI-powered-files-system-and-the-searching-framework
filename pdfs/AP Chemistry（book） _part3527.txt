be the stronger oxidizing agent, NaBrO3 or NaClO3?
Perchloric acid and its salts are the most stable oxyacids and oxyanions. Dilute solu-
tions of perchloric acid are quite safe, and many perchlorate salts are stable except when 
heated with organic materials. When heated, however, perchlorates can become vigor-
ous, even violent, oxidizers. Considerable caution should be exercised, therefore, when 
handling these substances, and it is crucial to avoid contact between perchlorates and 
readily oxidized material. The use of ammonium perchlorate 1NH4ClO42 as the oxidizer 
in the solid booster rockets for the Space Shuttle demonstrates the oxidizing power of 
perchlorates. The solid propellant contains a mixture of NH4ClO4 and powdered alumi-
num, the reducing agent. Each shuttle launch requires about 6 * 105 kg (700 tons) of 
NH4ClO4 (Figure 22.10).
