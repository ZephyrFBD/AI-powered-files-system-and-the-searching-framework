Total magnification is
mtotal = mAmB
(b) Lens A has a magnification (Eq. 23–9)
Thus, the first image is inverted and is half as high as the object (again Eq. 23–9):
Lens B takes this first image as object and changes its height by a factor
The second lens reinverts the image (the minus sign) but doesn’t change its size.
The final image height is (remember 
is the same as 
)
The total magnification is the product of 
and 
which here equals
or half the original height, and the final
image is upright.
