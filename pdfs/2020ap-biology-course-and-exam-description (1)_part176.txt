ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
IST-1
Heritable information provides for continuity of life.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-1.N
Describe the mechanisms 
by which genetic information 
flows from DNA to RNA 
to protein.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.N.1
The sequence of the RNA bases, together with 
the structure of the RNA molecule, determines 
RNA function—
a.	mRNA molecules carry information from 
DNA to the ribosome.
b.	Distinct tRNA molecules bind specific amino 
acids and have anti-codon sequences that 
base pair with the mRNA. tRNA is recruited to 
the ribosome during translation to generate 
the primary peptide sequence based on the 
mRNA sequence.
c.	rRNA molecules are functional building 
blocks of ribosomes.
