EXERCISE A You have a 
and a 
resistor. What is the smallest and largest
equivalent resistance that you can make with these two resistors?
15-
10-
Series or parallel? (a) The lightbulbs in
Fig. 19–5 are identical. Which configuration produces more light? (b) Which way
do you think the headlights of a car are wired? Ignore change of filament
resistance R with current.
RESPONSE (a) The equivalent resistance of the parallel circuit is found from
Eq. 19–4,
Thus
The parallel com-
bination then has lower resistance 
than the series combination
There will be more total current in the parallel configu-
ration (2), since 
and V is the same for both circuits. The tot
