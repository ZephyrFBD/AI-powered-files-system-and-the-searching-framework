 and Na2CO3 should be added 
to soften (remove the Ca2+ and Mg2+) 1200 L of  water in which
3Ca2+4 = 5.0 * 10-4 M  and
3Mg2+4 = 7.0 * 10-4 M?
 18.53  (a) What are trihalomethanes (THMs)? (b) Draw the Lewis 
structures of two example THMs.
 18.54  (a) Suppose that tests of a municipal water system reveal 
the presence of bromate ion, BrO3
-. What are the likely ori-
gins of this ion? (b) Is bromate ion an oxidizing or reducing 
agent?
Green Chemistry (Section 18.5)
 18.55  One of the principles of green chemistry is that it is better 
to use as few steps as possible in making new chemicals. 
In what ways does following this rule advance the goals of 
green chemistry? How does this principle relate to energy 
efficiency?
 18.56  Discuss how catalysts can make processes more energy 
efficient.
