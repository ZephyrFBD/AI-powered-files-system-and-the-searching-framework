either tetrahedral or square planar. In complexes having 
coordination number 6, the geometry is nearly always octahedral.

CHAPTER 23 Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry
One common chelating agent is the bidentate ligand ethylenediamine, denoted en:
CH2
H2N
NH2
CH2
in which each donor nitrogen atom has one nonbonding electron pair. These donor at-
oms are sufficiently far apart to allow both of them to bond to the metal ion in adjacent 
positions. The 3Co(en)343 +  complex ion, which contains three ethylenediamine ligands 
in the octahedral coordination sphere of cobalt(III), is shown in Figure 23.11. Notice that 
in the image on the right the en is written in a shorthand notation as two nitrogen atoms 
connected by an arc.
