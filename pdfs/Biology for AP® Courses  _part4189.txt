 beauty is an ephemeral spring plant that flowers early in the spring to avoid competing with
larger forest trees for sunlight. (credit: John Beetham)
In aquatic ecosystems, the availability of light may be limited because sunlight is absorbed by water, plants, suspended
particles, and resident microorganisms. Toward the bottom of a lake, pond, or ocean, there is a zone that light cannot
reach. Photosynthesis cannot take place there and, as a result, a number of adaptations have evolved that enable living
things to survive without light. For instance, aquatic plants have photosynthetic tissue near the surface of the water; for
example, think of the broad, floating leaves of a water lilyâ€”water lilies cannot survive without light. In environments such
as hydrothermal vents, some bacteria extract energy from inorganic chemicals because there is no light for photosynthesis.
The availability of nutrients in aquatic systems is also an important aspect of energy or photosynthesis. Many organi
