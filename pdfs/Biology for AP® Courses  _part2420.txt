al (3D) structures, or folding, of
proteins have been shown to contain more information
about evolutionary relationships than the sequences of
DNA nucleotides that encode the proteins. Amino acid
sequences of rabbit skeletal muscle actin (375 amino
acids) and bovine ATPase (386 amino acids) have only 39
locations in common. However, the 3D structure of these
proteins are nearly identical (Flaherty et al., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA, 1991). As information about the 3D
folding of proteins and the number of sequenced whole
genomes has increased, folding has been shown to be an
evolutionarily conserved property.
A. Analyze these data to refine the following model: The
evolutionary history of life on Earth can be inferred from
variations over time of the nucleotide sequence of a gene.
By applying a classification scheme based on protein
folding, Nasir and Caetano-Anoll√©s (Sci. Adv. 2015) have
determined the number of folding families that viruses
share with the three domains. Approximately
