separately, and the two are brought together with proper coefficients 
to balance the electrons on each side of the equation, so the elec-
trons cancel when the half-reactions are added.
VOLTAIC CELLS (SECTION 20.3) A voltaic (or galvanic) cell uses a 
spontaneous oxidationâ€“reduction reaction to generate electricity. In 
a voltaic cell the oxidation and reduction half-reactions often occur 
in separate half-cells. Each half-cell has a solid surface called an elec-
trode, where the half-reaction occurs. The electrode where oxidation 
occurs is called the anode, and the electrode where reduction occurs is 
called the cathode. The electrons released at the anode flow through 
an external circuit (where they do electrical work) to the cathode. 
Electrical neutrality in the solution is maintained by the migration of 
ions between the two half-cells through a device such as a salt bridge.
