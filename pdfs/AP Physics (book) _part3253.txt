curve). This 
curve, at least in the vicinity of the equilibrium separation 
closely
resembles the potential energy of a harmonic oscillator,
which is
shown superposed in dashed lines. Thus, for small displacements from 
each atom
experiences a restoring force approximately proportional to the displacement,
and the molecule vibrates as a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO)—see Chapter 11.
According to quantum mechanics, the possible quantized energy levels are 
(29;3)
where f is the classical frequency (see Chapter 11—f depends on the mass of 
the atoms and on the bond strength or “stiffness”) and 
is an integer called the
vibrational quantum number. The lowest energy state 
is not zero (as for
rotation), but has 
This is called the zero-point energy. Higher states
have energy 
and so on, as shown in Fig. 29–18. Transitions between
vibrational energy levels are subject to the selection rule
so allowed transitions occur only between adjace
