Exercise affects our brains. Studies have shown that regular exercise
over time increases the production of neurochemicals in the brain
and increases the volume of the hippocampus (a key part of the
brain’s memory network). In a study that involved exercise and
memory, scientists recruited 50 healthy men and women, who were
