perature of the reddish star is
The temperature of the bluish star will be double this because its peak wavelength
is half (350 nm vs. 700 nm):
(b) The Stefan-Boltzmann equation, Eq. 14–6, states that the power radiated
per unit area of surface from a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of
the Kelvin temperature,
The temperature of the bluish star is double that of
the reddish star, so the bluish one must radiate 
times as
much energy per unit area. But we are given that they have the same luminosity
(the same total power output); so the surface area of the blue star must be 
that of the red one. The surface area of a sphere is 
so the radius of the
reddish star is 
times larger than the radius of the bluish star (or 
times the volume).

An important astronomical discovery, made around 1900, was that for most stars,
the color is related to the intrinsic luminosity and therefore to the mass. A useful
way to present this relationship is by the so-called Hertzsprung–R
