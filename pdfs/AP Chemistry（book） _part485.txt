decomposition reactions, in which a single reactant forms two or 
more products; and (3) combustion reactions in oxygen, in which a 
substance, typically a hydrocarbon, reacts rapidly with O2 to form 
CO2 and H2O.
FORMULA WEIGHTS (SECTION 3.3) Much quantitative infor-
mation can be determined from chemical formulas and balanced 
chemical equations by using atomic weights. The formula weight of a 
compound equals the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms in its 
formula. If the formula is a molecular formula, the formula weight is 
also called the molecular weight. Atomic weights and formula weights 
can be used to determine the elemental composition of a compound.
AVOGADRO’S NUMBER AND THE MOLE (SECTION 3.4) A mole of 
any substance contains Avogadro’s number  16.02 * 10232 of formula 
units of that substance. The mass of a mole of atoms, molecules, or 
ions (the molar mass) equals the formula weight of that material ex-
pressed in grams. The mass of 1 molecule of H2O, for example, is
