Step 3 The gel will become cloudy as it solidifies (15–20 minutes). Do not disturb or touch 
the gel while it is solidifying! 
Step 4 When the agarose has set, carefully remove the ends of the casting tray and place 
the tray in the electrophoresis gel box so that the comb is at the negative (black) end. 
•  Why do you place the wells at the negative end of the gel box? 
•  What is the chemical nature of DNA? Will the DNA fragments migrate toward the 
positive end of the gel box or toward the negative end? 
Step 5 Fill the box with 1x TAE buffer, to a level that just covers the entire surface of the 
gel. 
Step 6 Gently remove the comb, taking care not to rip the wells. Make sure that the sample 
wells left by the comb are completely submerged in the buffer. 
Step 7 The gel is now ready to be loaded with your DNA samples. (If your teacher says 
that you will load the gel on another lab day, close the electrophoresis box to prevent 
drying
