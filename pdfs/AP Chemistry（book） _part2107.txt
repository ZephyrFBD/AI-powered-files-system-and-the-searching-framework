are colloids. A colloid particle may even consist of a single giant molecule. The hemoglo-
bin molecule, for example, which carries oxygen in your blood, has molecular dimen-
sions of 6.5 * 5.5 * 5.0 nm and a molar mass of 64,500 g>mol.
Although colloid particles may be so small that the dispersion appears uniform even 
under a microscope, they are large enough to scatter light. Consequently, most colloids 
appear cloudy or opaque unless they are very dilute. (For example, homogenized milk is a 
colloid of fat and p
