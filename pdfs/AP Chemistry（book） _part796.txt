United States.* In 2015 the United States 
consumed a total of 1.02 * 1017 kJ of 
energy.
Natural gas burns with far fewer by-products and produces less CO2 than either petro-
leum or coal. Petroleum is a liquid composed of hundreds of compounds, most of which 
are hydrocarbons, with the remainder being chiefly organic compounds containing sul-
fur, nitrogen, or oxygen. Coal, which is solid, contains hydrocarbons of high molecular 
weight as well as compounds containing sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen. Coal is the most 
abundant fossil fuel; current reserves are projected to last for well over 100 years at current 
consumption rates. However, the use of coal presents a number of problems.
Coal is a complex mixture of substances, and it contains components that cause air 
pollution. When coal is combusted, the sulfur it contains is converted mainly to sulfur
