2. While demonstrating Faraday’s law to her class, a physics
professor inadvertently moves the gold ring on her finger
from a location where a 0.68-T magnetic field points along
her finger to a zero-field location in 45 ms. The 1.5-cm-
diameter ring has a resistance and mass of 
and 15 g,
respectively. (a) Estimate the thermal energy produced in
the ring due to the flow of induced current. (b) Find the
temperature rise of the ring, assuming all of the thermal
energy produced goes into increasing the ring’s temper-
ature. The specific heat of gold is 
3. A small electric car overcomes a 250-N friction force when
traveling 
The electric motor is powered by ten
12-V batteries connected in series and is coupled directly
to the wheels whose diameters are 58 cm. The 290 armature
coils are rectangular, 12 cm by 15 cm, and rotate in a 0.65-T
magnetic field. (a) How much current does the motor draw
