w DNA sequences can be used to create phylogenetic trees.
(c) Using the data in the table, represent the most likely phylogenetic relationships among these organisms.
(d) Identify two other types of data that could be used to create phylogenetic trees.
Long Free-Response
13. In an experiment, students grow 100 Brassica rapa plants for 10 days. The mean plant height at day 10 and the
standard error of the mean are calculated and shown in the table (as Generation 1). The 10 tallest plants are
allowed to continue to grow, while the remaining 90 plants are eliminated from the population. When these 10
tallest plants flower, they are cross-pollinated, seed pods form, and their seeds are harvested. These seeds are
grown to day 10, and the heights of the resulting plants are recorded. The mean plant height at day 10 and the
standard error of the mean are calculated and shown in the table (as Generation 2).
