xplain what important control(s) the scientists should do to account for the procedure in Step 2.
It would be important to make sure the injection process itself is not causing a problem. There should be a control
group of wild-type cells that is injected with saline to account for the injection and make sure it is the actual
mitochondria that is causing the mutant phenotype.
c. If the nuclear DNA was injected into the wild-type Neurospora cells instead of the mitochondria, explain
whether the resulting fungi would have the poky phenotype.
They should NOT have the poky phenotype.
d. Justify your prediction.
The resulting fungi should not have the poky phenotype because the trait is not carried on a nuclear genome. It is
part of the mitochondrial genome, and giving the nuclear genome is not going to provide the gene for the poky
phenotype.

underground dwellings. Descri
