ominator is less than 1, the observed frequency 
is higher than
the source frequency f. That is,
For example, if a source emits a sound of
frequency 400 Hz when at rest, then when the source moves toward a fixed
observer with a speed of 
the observer hears a frequency (at 20°C) of
Now consider a source moving away from a stationary observer at a 
speed 
(observer on the left in Fig.12–19). Using the same arguments as above,
the wavelength 
perceived by our observer will have the minus sign on 
(first equation on this page) changed to plus:
The difference between the observed and emitted wavelengths will be
The observed frequency of the wave is
which equals
