result if bacteria (that were resistant to streptomycin and contained the F+
plasmid) were used to transform the bacteria from plate #4. Justify your prediction.
Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (D) Restriction enzymes (also known as restriction endonucleases) cut DNA at specific base pair sequences.
DNA ligase connects pieces of DNA, so choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because gel
electrophoresis is used to separate DNA fragments according to their size. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is
used to amplify specific sequences of DNA, so choice (C) is incorrect.
2. (D) Polymerase chain reaction is used to make multiple copies of (amplify) specific DNA sequences. Choice
(A) is incorrect because bacterial transformation is the process in which bacteria absorb and express foreign
DNA. CRISPR-Cas9 is used in gene editing, so choice (B) is incorrect. Gel electrophoresis is used to separate
fragments of DNA by size, so choice (C) is incorrect.
3. (C) Gel electrophoresis se
