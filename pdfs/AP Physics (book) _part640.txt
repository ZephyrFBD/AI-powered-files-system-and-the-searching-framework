ish system, the unit of power is the foot-pound per second
For practical purposes, a larger unit is often used, the horsepower. One horsepower†
(hp) is defined as 
which equals 746 W. An engine’s power is usually
specified in hp or in kW
‡.
To see the distinction between energy and power, consider the following
example. A person is limited in the work he or she can do, not only by the total
energy required, but also by how fast this energy is transformed: that is, by power.
For example, a person may be able to walk a long distance or climb many flights
of stairs before having to stop because so much energy has been expended.
On the other hand, a person who runs very quickly up stairs may feel exhausted
after only a flight or two. He or she is limited in this case by power, the rate at
which his or her body can transform chemical energy into mechanical energy.
