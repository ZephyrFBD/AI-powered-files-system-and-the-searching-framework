CHAPTER 24 The Chemistry of Life: Organic and Biological Chemistry
The common names of many carboxylic acids are based on their historical origins. 
Formic acid, for example, was first prepared by extraction from ants; its name is derived 
from the Latin word for “ant,” formica.
Carboxylic acids can be pro
