 to a bigger 
 
 ward upstairs with fifty empty beds and Famine ghosts galore with 
 
 green mouths and bony fingers pointing.At night I lie in bed thinking 
 
 about Tom Brown and his adventures at Rugby School and all the characters 
 
 in P. G.Wodehouse. I can dream about the red-lipped landlord’s 
 
 daughter and the highwayman, and the nurses and nuns can do nothing 
 
 about it. It’s lovely to know the world can’t interfere with the inside of 
 
 your head. 
 
 It’s August and I’m eleven. I’ve been in this hospital for two months 
 
 and I wonder if they’ll let me out for Christmas.The Kerry nurse tells 
 
 me I should get down on my two knees and thank God I’m alive at all 
 
 at all and not be complaining. 
 
 I’m not complaining, nurse, I’m only wondering if I’ll be home for 
 
 Christmas. 
 
 She won’t answer me. She tells me behave myself or she’ll send Sister 
 
 Rita up to me and then I’ll behave myself. 
 
 Mam comes to the hospital on my birthday and sends up a package
