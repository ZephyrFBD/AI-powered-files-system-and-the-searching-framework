 urine is
produced in the kidneys.
(C) Uric acid is excreted as a crystal to conserve water by many
terrestrial animals. However, humans and earthworms release
nitrogenous waste in the form of urea.
(B) The flame cell is a primitive excretory structure in
Platyhelminthes like planaria. All freshwater Protista have
contractile vacuoles that pump out water that continually leaks in.
The other pairings are all correct.
(C) All of the other options would greatly contribute to thirst.
Alcohol, particularly, is dehydrating because it blocks the
production of antidiuretic hormone, thus causing the release of extra
water in the urine.
(D) Uric acid is not soluble in water; therefore, it does not require
water in order to be excreted from the body.
(C) Filtration occurs in Bowmanâ€™s capsule.
(A) Secretion occurs in the proximal and distal tubules.
(B) The ascending loop of Henle is impermeable to water.
(D) The target structure of ADH is the collecting tubule within the
kidney.
