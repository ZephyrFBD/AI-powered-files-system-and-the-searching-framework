f the two remains constant. At the bottom of the hill it has 
its maximum kinetic energy, and as it climbs up the other side the kinetic 
energy changes back to potential energy. When the car comes to rest again at 
the same height from which it started, all of its energy will be potential energy.
Given that the gravitational potential energy is proportional to the vertical height,
energy conservation tells us that (in the absence of friction) the car comes to rest
at a height equal to its original height. If the two hills are the same height, the car
will just barely reach the top of the second hill when it stops. If the second hill is
lower than the first, not all of the carâ€™s kinetic energy will be transformed to poten-
tial energy and the car can continue over the top and down the other side. If the
second hill is higher, the car will reach a maximum height on it equal to its original
height on the first hill. This is true (in the absence of friction) no matter how steep
the hill i
