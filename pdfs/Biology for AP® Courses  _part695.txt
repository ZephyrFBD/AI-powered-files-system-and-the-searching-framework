Figure 6.12 Entropy is a measure of randomness or disorder in a system. Gases have higher entropy than liquids, and
liquids have higher entropy than solids.
Think About It
•
Imagine a large ant colony with an elaborate nest, containing many tunnels and passageways. Now imagine that
an earthquake shakes the ground and demolishes the nest. Did the ant nest have higher entropy before or after the
earthquake? What can the ants do to restore their nest to close to its original amount of entropy? Explain your
answers.
•
Energy transfers take place constantly in everyday activities. Think of two scenarios: cooking on a stove and
driving a car. Explain how the second law of thermodynamics applies to these two scenarios.
Section Summary
In studying energy, scientists use the term “system” to refer to the matter and its environment involved in energy t
