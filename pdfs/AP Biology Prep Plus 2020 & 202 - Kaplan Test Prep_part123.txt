urrounded by membranes on the margins of the cell.
Ribosomes were visible in the cytoplasm. Which of the following
conclusions can the scientists most reasonably draw from their
observations?
The organism is a eukaryote because it is visible to the naked
eye and contains loose membranes.
(A)
The organism cannot be yet classified because there are too

(B)
The organism is probably a virus because it was found inside

(C)
The organism is a prokaryote because it does not contain a

(D)
2. Scientists measured the density of mitochondria in several human
tissues. They estimated the mitochondrial content by measuring
the activity of a marker enzyme, citrate synthase, which is present
only in mitochondria. Their results are plotted in the bar graph
below.
