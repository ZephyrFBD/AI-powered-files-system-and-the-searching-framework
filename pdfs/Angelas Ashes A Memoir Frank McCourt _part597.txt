talking like that because of Mr.Hannon. 
 
 Like a son, she says, and I’m glad he had that feeling. His working 
 
 days are over, you know. He has to stay at home from this out.There 
 
 might be a cure and if there is sure he might be able to get a job as a 
 
 watchman where he doesn’t have to be lifting and hauling. 
 
 I won’t have a job anymore, Mrs. Hannon. 
 
 You have a job, Frank. School.That’s your job. 
 
 That’s not a job,Mrs.Hannon. 
 
 You’ll never have another job like it, Frank. It breaks Mr.Hannon’s 
 
  
  
 heart to think of you dragging bags of coal off a float and it breaks your 
 
 mother’s heart and ’twill destroy your eyes. God knows I’m sorry I ever 
 
 got you into this for it had your poor mother caught between your eyes 
 
 and Mr.Hannon’s legs. 
 
 Can I go to the hospital to see Mr.Hannon? 
 
 They might not let you in but surely you can come here to see him. 
 
 God knows he won’t be doing much but reading and looking out the 
 
 window.
