at 
 
 with the First Officer and the Wireless Officer.The man in the boat says 
 
 his name is Tim Boyle from Mayo God help us and we docked there at 
 
 the right time because there’s a bit of a party and we’re all invited. He 
 
 359 
 
 takes us to a house with a lawn, a fountain and three pink birds standing 
 
 on one leg.There are five women in a room called a living room. 
 
 The women have stiff hair, spotless frocks. They have glasses in their 
 
 hands and they’re friendly and smile with perfect teeth. One says,Come 
 
 right in. Just in time for the pawty. 
 
 Pawty.That’s the way they talk and I suppose I’ll be talking like that 
 
 in a few years. 
 
  
  
 Tim Boyle tells us the girls are having a bit of a time while their 
 
 husbands are away overnight hunting deer, and one woman, Betty, says, 
 
 Yeah. Buddies from the war.That war is over nearly five years and they 
 
 can’t get over it so they shoot animals every weekend and drink Rheingold 
 
 till they can’t see.
