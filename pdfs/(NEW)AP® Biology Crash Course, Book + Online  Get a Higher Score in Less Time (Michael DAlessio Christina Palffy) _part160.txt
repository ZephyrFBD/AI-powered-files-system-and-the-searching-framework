 community.
1. Food chains—are single energy pathways in which food is transferred from one trophic level to the
next.
2. Food webs—an elaborate web of organisms feeding at more than one trophic level.
Example of a Food Chain (→) within a Food Web (→)
The arrows in a food chain or web indicate the flow of energy. If all arrows originating from a species point away from it, it is
most likely a primary producer. If all arrows point only toward a species, it is either a consumer or a decomposer.

Nutrient Cycles
A. Nutrient cycles recycle water, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, which move the ecosystem’s organic
matter to the abiotic portions of an ecosystem and back again.
B. Water Cycle—involves the processes of evaporation, transpiration, and precipitation.
C. Carbon Cycle—involves the processes of photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and combustion.
D. Nitrogen Cycle—involves a complex series of biochemical reactions by different soil bacteria to
compounds assimilated by plants.
