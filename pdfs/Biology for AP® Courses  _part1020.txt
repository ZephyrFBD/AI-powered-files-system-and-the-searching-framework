 extracellular region of the channel, there
is a conformational change in the proteins structure that allows ions such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen to
pass through (Figure 9.5).

Figure 9.5 Gated ion channels form a pore through the plasma membrane that opens when the signaling molecule
binds. The open pore then allows ions to flow into or out of the cell.
G-protein-linked receptors bind a ligand and activate a membrane protein called a G-protein. The activated G-protein then
interacts with either an ion channel or an enzyme in the membrane (Figure 9.6). All G-protein-linked receptors have seven
transmembrane domains, b
