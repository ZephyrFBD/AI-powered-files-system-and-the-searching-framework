Pressure Effects
The solubilities of solids and liquids are not appreciably affected by pressure, whereas 
the solubility of a gas in any solvent is increased as the partial pressure of the gas above the sol-
vent increases. We can understand the effect of pressure on gas solubility by considering

Figure 13.12, which shows carbon dioxide gas distributed between the gas and solution 
phases. When equilibrium is established, the rate at which gas molecules enter the solu-
tion equals the rate at which solute molecules escape from the solution to enter the gas 
phase. The equal number of up and down arrows in the left container in Figure 13.12 
represent these opposing proces
