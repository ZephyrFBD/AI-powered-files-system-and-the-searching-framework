 is usually underground. Figure 23.2 shows the
organ systems of a typical plant.
Figure 23.2 The shoot system of a plant consists of leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The root system anchors the
plant while absorbing water and minerals from the soil.
Plant Tissues
Plants are multicellular eukaryotes with tissue systems made of various cell types that carry out specific functions. Plant
tissue systems fall into one of two general types: meristematic tissue, and permanent (or non-meristematic) tissue. Cells
of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems, which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth.
Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated, and they continue to divide and
contribute to the growth of the plant. In contrast, permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively
dividing.
Meristematic tissues consist of three types, based on their location in the plant. Apical meristems contain meristematic
