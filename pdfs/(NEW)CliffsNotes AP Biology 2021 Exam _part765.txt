d monosaccharides
(glucose), but not disaccharides (sucrose), polysaccharides (starch), or proteins.
In this investigation, diffusion and osmosis are manipulated by two variables:
1. Solute type. Smaller molecules (water, NaCl, glucose) can diffuse across the model “plasma membrane” (dialysis
tubing), while larger molecules (sucrose, proteins) cannot.
2. Solute concentration. The relative concentration of solutes inside and outside the bag determines the net flow of
solutes or water across the membrane; the greater the solute concentration gradient, the faster the initial flow of
solutes.
To investigate the influence of solute type and concentration, nine bags are prepared. Four bags are each filled with
a different solute: sucrose, NaCl, glucose, and ovalbumin (a protein). These four bags are immersed in water.
Another four bags are filled with water and each is immersed in one of the four different solute solutions. A ninth
bag, a control, is filled with water and immersed in water.
