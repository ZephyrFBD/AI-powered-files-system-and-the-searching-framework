um sensitive. Troponin binds to the calcium and moves the tropomyosin binding site.
b.
Myosin binding sites are covered by the troponin complex to which is attached tropomyosin. Tropomyosin
is calcium sensitive. It binds to the calcium and moves the troponin binding site.
c.
Actin binding sites are covered by tropomyosin to which the troponin complex is attached. This complex is
calcium sensitive. Troponin binds to the calcium and moves the tropomyosin binding site.
d.
Myosin binding sites are covered by tropomyosin to which the troponin complex is attached. This complex
is calcium sensitive. Troponin binds to the calcium and moves the tropomyosin binding site.

Figure 29.37 The cross-bridge muscle contraction cycle, which is triggered by Ca2+ binding to the actin active
site, is shown. With each contraction cycle, actin moves relative to myosin.
