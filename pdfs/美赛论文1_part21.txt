d countries and take 
the reference of their indexes of the sustainable development, and finally we set e as 
0.4. In most times, when the index of a developing country reaches 0.4, the 
developing country is in sustainable development. However, if the developing country 
wants to advance the index from 0.4 to 0.6, it will be a tremendously harsh process, 
which is also the process that a developing country turns into a developed country 
gradually. 
From the table below, we can evaluate the sustainability better and smoothly.
