e molar mass: urms = 13RT>ℳ. The 
most probable speed of a gas molecule is given by ump = 12RT>ℳ.
MOLECULAR EFFUSION AND DIFFUSION (SECTION 10.8) It follows 
from kinetic-molecular theory that the rate at which a gas undergoes 
effusion (escapes through a tiny hole) is inversely proportional to the 
square root of its molar mass (Graham’s law). The diffusion of one gas 
through the space occupied by a second gas is another phenomenon re-
lated to the speeds at which molecules move. Because moving molecules 
undergo frequent collisions with one another, the mean free path—the 
mean distance traveled between collisions—is short. Collisions between 
molecules limit the rate at which a gas molecule can diffuse.

Departures from ideal behavior increase in magnitude as pressure 
increases and as temperature decreases. Real gases depart from ideal 
behavior because (1) the molecules possess finite volume and (2) the
