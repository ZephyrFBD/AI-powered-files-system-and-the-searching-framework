ipped
further, the CG goes past the pivot point and the torque causes the object to topple,
Fig. 9–16c. In general, an object whose center of gravity is above its base of support
will be stable if a vertical line projected downward from the CG falls within the base
of support. This is because the normal force upward on the object (which balances
out gravity) can be exerted only within the area of contact, so if the force of gravity
acts beyond this area, a net torque will act to topple the object.
Stability, then, can be relative. A brick lying on its widest face is more stable
than a brick standing on its end, for it will take more of an effort to tip it over. In
the extreme case of the pencil in Fig. 9–15b, the base is practically a point and the
slightest disturbance will topple it. In general, the larger the base and the lower
the CG, the more stable the object.
In this sense, humans are less stable than four-legged mammals, which have a
larger base of support because of their four
