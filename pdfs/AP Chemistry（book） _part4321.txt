 an element exhibits the 
physical and chemical properties characteristic of metals, for 
example, luster, malleability, ductility, and good thermal and 
electrical conductivity. (Section 7.6)
metallic elements (metals) Elements that are usually solids at 
room temperature, exhibit high electrical and heat conductivity, 
and appear lustrous. Most of the elements in the periodic table 
are metals. (Sections 2.5 and 12.1)
metallic hydrides Compounds formed when hydrogen reacts 
with transition metals; these compounds contain the hydride 
ion, H-. (Section 22.2)
metallic solids Solids that are composed of metal atoms held 
together by a delocalized “sea” of collectively shared valence 
electrons. (Sections 12.1 and 12.3)
metalloids Elements that lie along the diagonal line separating 
the metals from the nonmetals in the periodic table; the 
properties of metalloids are intermediate between those of 
metals and nonmetals. (Section 2.5)
metallurgy The science of extracting metals from thei
