gas Matter that has no fixed volume or shape; it uniformly fills 
its container. (Section 1.2)
gas constant (R) The constant of proportionality in the ideal-gas 
equation. (Section 10.4)
geometric isomerism A form of isomerism in which compounds 
with the same type and number of atoms and the same 
chemical bonds have different spatial arrangements of these 
atoms and bonds. (Sections 23.4 and 24.3)
Gibbs free energy A thermodynamic state function that 
combines enthalpy and entropy, in the form G = H - TS. For a 
change occurring at constant temperature and pressure, the 
change in free energy is ∆G = ∆H - T∆S. (Section 19.5)
glass An amorphous solid formed by fusion of SiO2, CaO, and 
Na2O. Other oxides may also be used to form glasses with 
differing characteristics. (Section 22.10)
glucose A polyhydroxy aldehyde whose formula is 
CH2OH1CHOH24CHO; it is the most important of the 
monosaccharides. (Section 24.8)
glycogen The general name given to a group of p
