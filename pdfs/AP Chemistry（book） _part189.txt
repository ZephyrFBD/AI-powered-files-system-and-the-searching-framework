 Dimensional Analysis
Because measured quantities have units associated with them, it is important to 
keep track of units as well as numerical values when using the quantities in calcu-
lations. Throughout the text we use dimensional analysis in solving problems. In 
dimensional analysis, units are multiplied together or divided into each other 
along with the numerical values. Equivalent units cancel each other. Using di-
mensional analysis helps ensure that solutions to problems yield the proper units. 
Moreover, it provides a systematic way of solving many numerical problems and of 
checking solutions for possible errors.
Conversion Factors
The key to using dimensional analysis is the correct use of conversion factors to change 
one unit into another. A conversion factor is a fraction whose numerator and
