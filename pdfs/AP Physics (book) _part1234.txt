eriod twice that of the
lighter one.
(b) The lighter child swings with a period twice that of the
heavier one.
(c) Both children swing with the same period.
8. A grandfather clock is “losing” time because its pendulum
moves too slowly. Assume that the pendulum is a massive
bob at the end of a string. The motion of this pendulum can
be sped up by (list all that work):
(a) shortening the string.
(b) lengthening the string.
(c) increasing the mass of the bob.
(d) decreasing the mass of the bob.

17. The speed of sound in most solids is somewhat greater
than in air, yet the density of solids is much greater (
to
times). Explain.
18. Give two reasons why circular water waves decrease in
amplitude as they travel away from the source.
19. Two linear waves have the same amplitude and speed, and
otherwise are identical, except one has half the wavelength
of the other. Which transmits more energy? By what factor?
20. When a sinusoidal wave crosses the boundary between two
sections of
