the water hyacinth and zebra mussel, or whether it will be the destroyer of the largest freshwater fishery of
the world.
The issues associated with Asian carp show how population and community ecology, fisheries
management, and politics intersect on issues of vital importance to the human food supply and economy.
Socio-political issues like this make extensive use of the sciences of population ecology (the study of
members of a particular species occupying a particular area known as a habitat) and community ecology
(the study of the interaction of all species within a habitat).
Why are invasive species such as the A
