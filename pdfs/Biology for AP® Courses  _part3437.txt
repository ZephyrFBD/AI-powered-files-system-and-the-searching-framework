e ligand binding site of a nuclear receptor, new drugs
can be developed to match the site and regulate expression
when the endocrine system fails. Even greater flexibility in
drug design is allowed when small molecules, called
positive (PAM) and negative (NAM) allosteric modulators,
change the shape of the ligand binding site. The receptors
for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing
hormone (LH) were subjects in a drug discovery program
using PAMs and NAMs (Nataraja et al., Frontiers in
Endocrinology, 6, 2015).
E. Explain how the refinement of nuclear receptor by
attachment of a molecule other than the ligand of the
receptor can increase the level of expression of genes
targeted by the transcription factor.
73. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates
the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and
luteinizing hormone (LH). The concentration of these
hormones over time in females regulates the menstrual
cycle. GnRH expressing neurons (GEN) are scattered
