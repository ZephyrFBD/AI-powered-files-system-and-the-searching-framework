em modeling are routinely used in research and ecosystem
management: a conceptual model, an analytical model, and a simulation model. A conceptual model is an ecosystem model
that consists of flow charts to show interactions of different compartments of the living and nonliving components of the
ecosystem. A conceptual model describes ecosystem structure and dynamics and shows how environmental disturbances
affect the ecosystem; however, its ability to predict the effects of these disturbances is limited. Analytical and simulation
models, in contrast, are mathematical methods of describing ecosystems that are indeed capable of predicting the effects
of potential environmental changes without direct experimentation, although with some limitations as to accuracy. An
analytical model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of
environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics. A simulation model is an ecosystem model that
