This reaction is strongly endothermic, telling us that O3 is less stable than O2.
Although both O2 and O3 are colorless and therefore do not absorb visible light, O3 
absorbs certain wavelengths of ultraviolet light that O2 does not. Because of this difference, 
the presence of ozone in the upper atmosphere is beneficial, filtering out harmful UV light. 
Ozone and oxygen also have different chemical properties. Ozone, which has a pungent odor, 
is a powerful oxidizing agent. Because of this property, ozone is sometimes added to water to 
kill bacteria or used in low levels to help to purify air. However, the reactivity of ozone also 
makes its presence in polluted air near Earth’s surface detrimental to human health.
Oxygen has a great tendency to attract electrons from other elements (to oxi-
dize them). Oxygen in combination with a metal is almost always present as the oxide 
ion, O2-. This ion has a noble-gas configuration and is particularly stable. As shown
