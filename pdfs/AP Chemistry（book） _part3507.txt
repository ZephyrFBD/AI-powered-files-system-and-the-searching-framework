rogen economy. Although H2(g) has 
a high energy density by mass, it has a low energy density by volume. 
Thus, storing hydrogen as a gas requires a large volume compared to 
the energy it delivers. There are also safety issues associated with han-
dling and storing the gas because its combustion can be explosive. 
Storing hydrogen in the form of various hydride compounds such as 
LiAlH4 is being investigated as a means of reducing the volume and 
increasing the safety. One problem with this approach, however, is 
that such compounds have high energy density by volume but low 
energy density by mass.

Uses of Hydrogen
Hydrogen is commercially important. About half of the H2 produced is used to synthe-
size ammonia by the Haber process. 
 (Section 15.2) Much of the remaining hydrogen 
is used to convert high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons from petroleum into lower- 
molecular-weight hydrocarbons suitable for fuel (gasoline, diesel, and others) in a p
