Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section, support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in
Big Idea 2 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework
provide a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional
activities, and AP® Exam questions. A Learning Objective merges required content with one or more of the seven Science
Practices.
