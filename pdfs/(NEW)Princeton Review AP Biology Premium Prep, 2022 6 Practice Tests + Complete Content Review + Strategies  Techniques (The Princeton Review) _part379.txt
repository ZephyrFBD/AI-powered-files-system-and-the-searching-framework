Evidence for Evolution
In essence, nature “selects” which living things survive and reproduce. Today, we find support for the theory of
evolution in several areas:
Paleontology, or the study of fossils: paleontology has revealed to us both the great variety
of organisms (most of which, including trilobites, dinosaurs, and the woolly mammoth, have
died off) and the major lines of evolution. Fossils can be dated by:
i. The age of the rocks where a fossil is found
ii. The rate of decay of isotopes including carbon-14
iii. Geographical data
Biogeography, or the study of the distribution of flora (plants) and fauna (animals) in the
environment: scientists have found related species in widely separated regions of the world.
For example, Darwin observed that animals in the Galápagos have traits similar to t
