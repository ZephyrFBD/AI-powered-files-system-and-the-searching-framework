de emission are located in the eastern half 
of the United States, and prevailing winds carry emissions in an 
eastward direction. Figure 18.10 CaSO31s2 Figure 18.12 The 
Earth’s surface absorbs 492 W/m2. Of that amount 390 W/m2 or 
79% is radiated back toward the atmosphere. Figure 18.14 The 
increasing slope corresponds to an increasing rate of addition of 
CO2 to the atmosphere, probably as a result of ever-increasing burn-
ing of fossil fuels worldwide. Figure 18.16 Evaporation from sea 
water, evaporation from freshwater; evaporation and transpiration 
from land. Figure 18.17 As the temperature of water goes down 
its density increases. Therefore, density increases as depth increases 
(note the pressure also increases which also results in an increase 
in density). Figure 18.21 To reduce concentrations of dissolved 
iron and manganese, remove H2S and NH3, and reduce bacterial 
levels.
