io strains. The graph represents the probability of 
antagonism between any two given strains of Vibrio bacteria as a function of genetic relatedness (genetic 
distance). The greater the genetic distance, the less related are any two bacterial strains. 
(a) Describe ONE type of molecular evidence that can be used to determine the genetic relatedness of bacterial 
strains isolated from naturally occurring populations. 
(b) Using the information presented in the graph, describe the relationship between antagonism and genetic 
relatedness in the communities of Vibrio bacteria sampled for the study. 
(c) Provide reasoning to show how the results of the study support the claim that cooperation among Vibrio 
bacteria can increase the fitness of some individual bacteria living in a natural environment.
