r relationships between
different quantities—that is, determining how one quantity affects another.
As a simple example, the ancients found that if one circle has twice the
diameter of a second circle, the first also has twice the circumference. If the
diameter is three times as large, the circumference is also three times as large. In
other words, an increase in the diameter results in a proportional increase in the
circumference. We say that the circumference is directly proportional to the
diameter. This can be written in symbols as
where “ ” means “is
proportional to,” and C and D refer to the circumference and diameter of a circle,
respectively. The next step is to change this proportionality to an equation,
which will make it possible to link the two quantities numerically. This means
inserting a proportionality constant, which in many cases is determined by meas-
urement. The ancients found that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter
of any circle was 3.1416 (to keep onl
