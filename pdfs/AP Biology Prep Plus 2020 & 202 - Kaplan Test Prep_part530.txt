events
the moths from overheating by transferring the heat to the abdomen:
the temperature of the thorax plateaus while the temperature of the
abdomen increases. For the dead moths, the thorax overheats while
the temperature of the abdomen remains at the ambient temperature.
In the second experiment, metabolic heat from the contraction of
flight muscles would increase the body temperature in the thorax of
the free-flying moths. The free-flying moths with circulation intact
would exhibit body temperatures like that of the live moth, while the
moths with circulation blocked would exhibit body temperatures like
that of the dead moth. The correct answer is thus (B). (A) is incorrect
because, with circulation intact, the thorax would not overheat and
the temperature of the abdomen would increase. (C) is incorrect
because only the thorax would become overheated when the
circulation is blocked. (D) is incorrect because the temperature in the
abdomen of the free-flying moths with circulation b
