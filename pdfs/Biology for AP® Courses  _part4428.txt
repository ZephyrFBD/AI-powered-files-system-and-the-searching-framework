Biodiversity, Species Richness, and Relative Species Abundance
Biodiversity describes a communityâ€™s biological complexity: it is measured by the number of different species (species
richness) in a particular area and their relative abundance (species evenness). The area in question could be a habitat, a
biome, or the entire biosphere. Species richness is the term that is used to describe the number of species living in a habitat
or biome. Species richness varies across the globe (Figure 36.30). One factor in determining species richness is latitude,
with the greatest species richness occurring in ecosystems near the equator, which often have warmer temperatures, large
amounts of rainfall, and low seasonality. The lowest species richness occurs near the poles, which are much colder, drier,
and thus less conducive to life in Geol
