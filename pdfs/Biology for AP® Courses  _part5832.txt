One final thought …
The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Flame on burn desire
Love with tongues of ﬁre
Purge the soul
Make love your goal
I’ll protect you from the hooded claw
Keep the vampires from your door
When the chips are down I’ll be around
With my undying, death-defying
Love for you
Envy will hurt itself
Let yourself be beautiful
Sparkling love, ﬂowers
And pearls and preĴy girls
Love is like an energy
Rushin’ rushin’ inside of me
This time we go sublime
Lovers entwine, divine, divine,
Love is danger, love is pleasure
Love is pure – the only treasure
I’m so in love with you
Purge the soul
Make love your goal
The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
The power of love
A force
