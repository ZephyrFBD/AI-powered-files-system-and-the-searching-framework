FIGURE 6–16 A crate is pushed slowly at 
constant speed across a rough floor from 
position 1 to position 2 via two paths, one
straight and one curved. The pushing 
force 
is in the direction of motion at 
each point. (The friction force opposes the 
motion.) Hence for a constant magnitude 
pushing force, the work it does is  
so if the distance traveled d is greater (as for
the curved path), then W is greater. The work
done does not depend only on points 1 and 2;
it also depends on the path taken.

You do more work on the curved path because the distance is greater and, unlike
the gravitational force, the pushing force 
is in the direction of motion at 
each point. Thus the work done by the person in Fig.6–16 does not depend only on
points 1 and 2; it depends also on the path taken. The force of kinetic friction, also
shown in Fig. 6–16, always opposes the motion; it too is a nonconservativ
