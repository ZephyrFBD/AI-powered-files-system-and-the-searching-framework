ure on the diver given 
the atmospheric pressure 198 kPa2 and the depth of the water  
131.0 m2.
Plan The total pressure on the diver equals that of the atmosphere 
plus that of the water. The pressure of the water can be calculated 
starting with Equation 10.1, P = F>A. The force, F, due to the 
water above the diver is given by its mass times the acceleration 
due to gravity, F = mg, where g = 9.81 m>s2.
Solve The pressure caused by the water is
P = F
A =

The mass of the water is related to its density 1d = m>V, so  
m = d * V2. We can treat the water as a column whose volume 
equals its cross-sectional area times its height: V = A * h. When  
we make these substitutions for mass 1m = d * V2 and volume  
1V = A * h2, we have

Using a Manometer to Measure Gas Pressure
On a certain day, a laboratory barometer indicates that the atmospheric pressure is 
764.7 torr. A sample of gas is placed in a flask attached to an open-end me
