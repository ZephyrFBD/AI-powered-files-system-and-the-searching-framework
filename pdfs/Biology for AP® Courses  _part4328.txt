iginally designed to study human populations. For example,
life tables, which detail the life expectancy of individuals within a population, were initially developed by life insurance
companies to set insurance rates. In fact, while the term “demographics” is commonly used when discussing humans, all
living populations can be studied using this approach.

Population Size and Density
The study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species exist, and how
closely associated they are with each other. Within a particular habitat, a population can be characterized by its population
size (N), the total number of individuals, and its population density, the number of individuals within a specific area or
volume. Population size and density are the two main characteristics used to describe and understand populations. For
example, populations with more individuals may be more stable than smaller popu
