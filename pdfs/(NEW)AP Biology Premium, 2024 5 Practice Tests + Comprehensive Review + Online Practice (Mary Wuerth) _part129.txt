turn completely yellow first.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
12. Apoptosis is programmed cell death. Apoptosis is often triggered by mutations that could cause a cell to form a
tumor if the cell continued to grow and multiply.
(a) Describe the organelle in a eukaryotic cell that is most likely to participate in apoptosis.
(b) Explain other functions the organelle from part (a) would have in the cell besides participating in
apoptosis.
(c) A mutation causes the enzymes in the organelle from part (a) to become nonfunctional. Predict what
effects this would have on the cell.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
Long Free-Response
13. Two different molecules, A and B, can enter a cell using passive transport. A cell that did not initially contain
molecule A or molecule B was placed in a beaker with a solution containing equal concentrations of both
molecules for 30 minutes. The cell was removed from the beaker, and the concentration of each molecule
inside the cell was me
