57. What are the four types and functions of RNA?
a.
mRNA is a single stranded transcript of DNA.
rRNA is found in ribosomes. tRNA transfers
specific amino acids to a developing protein
strand. miRNA regulates the expression of
mRNA strands.
b.
mRNA is a single stranded transcript of rRNA.
rRNA is translated in ribosomes to make
proteins. tRNA transfers specific amino acids to
a developing protein strand. microRNA
(miRNA) regulates the expression of the mRNA
strand.
c.
mRNA regulates the expression of the miRNA
strand. rRNA are found in ribosomes. tRNA
transfers specific amino acids to a developing
protein strand. miRNA is a single stranded
transcript of DNA.
d.
mRNA is a single stranded transcript of DNA.
rRNA transfers specific amino acids to a
developing protein strand. tRNA is found in
ribosomes. miRNA regulates the expression of
the mRNA strand.
