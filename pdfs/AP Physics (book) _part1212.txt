ing will persist. The ends of the string, since they are fixed, will be
nodes. There may be other nodes as well. Some of the possible resonant modes of
vibration (standing waves) are shown in Fig. 11–41b. Generally, the motion will
be a combination of these different resonant modes, but only those frequencies
that correspond to a resonant frequency will be present.

To determine the resonant frequencies, we first note that the wavelengths of
the standing waves bear a simple relationship to the length of the string. The
lowest frequency, called the fundamental frequency, correspon
