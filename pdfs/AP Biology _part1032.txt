nsists of the following stages in this order: G1
(the cell is growing), S (DNA replicates), G2 (second gap of
growth), and then mitosis (division of the nucleus). Therefore, if the
quantity of DNA in G1 is X (before the S phase), then in mitosis
(after the S phase), the DNA content must be double X or 2X.
(B) There is a double hydrogen bond between adenine and thymine
in DNA and a triple bond between cytosine and guanine. Breaks in
DNA occur more often between adenine and thymine than between
cytosine and guanine.
(C) This is a chloroplast. The light-dependent reactions, where ATP
is synthesized and oxygen is released, occurs in the grana (C). The
light-independent reactions, where PGAL is made, occur in the
stroma (B). Nothing related to photosynthesis is occurring in A,
which is the outer membrane of the chloroplast.
