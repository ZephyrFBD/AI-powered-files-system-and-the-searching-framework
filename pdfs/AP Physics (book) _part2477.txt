ivers have more stages than those shown. Various means are used
to increase the sensitivity and selectivity (ability to detect weak signals and dis-
tinguish them from other stations), and to minimize distortion of the original
signal.†
A television receiver does similar things to both the audio and the video signals.
The audio signal goes finally to the loudspeaker, and the video signal to the monitor
screen, such as an LCD (Sections 17–11 and 24–11).

One kind of antenna consists of one or more conducting rods; the electric field
in the EM waves exerts a force on the electrons in the conductor, causing them to
move back and forth at the frequencies of the waves (Fig. 22–18a). A second type
of antenna consists of a tubular coil of wire which detects the magnetic field of the
wave: the changing B
