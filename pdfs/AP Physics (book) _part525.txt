tion of 1 day) and
almost 25 h, respectively, roughly in circles. The orbits of the planets as seen from
Earth are very complicated, however.
In the Sun’s reference frame, Earth makes one revolution (
definition of the
year) in 365.256 days, in an ellipse that is nearly a circle. The Sun’s reference frame
has the advantage that the other planets also have simple elliptical orbits. (Or nearly
so—each planet’s gravity pulls on the others, causing small perturbations.) The Sun’s
vastly greater mass (
Earth’s) allows it to be an easier reference frame to use.
The Sun itself (and the Earth with it) revolves around the center of our Galaxy
(see Fig. 33–2 or 5–49) which itself moves relative to other galaxies. Indeed, there is
no one reference frame that we can consider as preferred or central.
