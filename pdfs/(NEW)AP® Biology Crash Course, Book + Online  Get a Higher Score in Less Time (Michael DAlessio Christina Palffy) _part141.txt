Species B and C are more closely related to each other than to species A.
All species are generated from an ancestor species with bi-pedalism.
All species retain traits from the ancestor but have evolved to gain some specific trait through time.

A. The Origin of Life: Hypotheses and Evidence
1. Primitive Earth was thought to have the following atmospheric molecules—water (H2O), methane
(CH4), hydrogen (H2), and ammonia (NH3)—and no oxygen.
2. These inorganic precursors of organic molecules on primitive Earth could have been formed as a
result of an electrical spark and the lack of oxygen.
3. As a result, crude organic molecules including mono-saccharides, fatty acids, amino acids, and nucleic
acids were formed.
Miller-Urey experiment—tested the Oparin-Haldane model; the atmosphere on primitive Earth was
the precursor for the synthesis of organic molecules.
4. Mo
