oundings through specialized exchange surfaces. As cells increase in volume, the
surface area-to-volume ratio decreases, and the exchange of materials becomes less efficient.
The surface area and volumes of cells can be calculated using typical geometry formulas listed below. Different
types of cells have different shapes, so be careful to use the appropriate formula if you’re asked to calculate the
ratio!
Surface Area-to-Volume Ratio
This is a concept that comes up often. Use the volume formulas on the
Equations and Formulas sheet to practice calculating the surface area-to-
volume ratios of different-sized cubes and spheres.
Relevant Equations
Volume of a Sphere: 
πr3
Volume of a Cube: V = s3
Volume of a Rectangular Solid: V = lwh
Volume of a Cylinder: V = πr2h
Surface Area of a Sphere: SA = 4πr2
Surface Area of a Cube: SA = 6s2
Surface Area of a Rectangular Solid: SA = 2lh + 2lw + 2wh
Surface Area of a Cylinder: SA = 2πrh + 2πr2
r = radius
l = length
h = height
w = width
