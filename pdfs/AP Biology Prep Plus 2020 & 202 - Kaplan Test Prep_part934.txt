would all get one healthy X
chromosome from their mother and the disorder is recessive.
7. B
Transpiration is able to counter the force of gravity by depending on
some of the distinctive properties of water. Because water is cohesive
and adhesive, evaporation from stomata in the leaves literally pulls
water up the tree, much like sucking up liquid through a straw. (B) is
thus correct. Transpiration is a passive process, one that does not
require energy expenditure by the plant, ruling out (A). Although
positive pressure in the roots can cause some water loss, it is not the
typical case and does not occur in very tall trees, so (C) is incorrect. (D)
is incorrect because gravity could only exert pressure downward.
8. C
Complete cellular respiration is an aerobic (oxygen-requiring) process.
In the absence of oxygen, fermentation occurs and the amount of ATP
yielded decreases. (C) is thus correct. Adding glucose to the system,
(A), would not decrease the amount of ATP produced, nor would i
