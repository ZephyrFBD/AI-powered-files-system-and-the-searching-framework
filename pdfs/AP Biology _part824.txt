rent sizes and shapes.
Calculate the ratio of surface area to volume in both small and large
cells. Predict which cell(s) might eliminate waste and take in nutrients
faster by diffusion—a small cell or a large cell. See Figure 19.6.

of Different Sizes
Part 2: Create models of living cells.
OBJECTIVE
Investigate the processes of diffusion, osmosis, and water potential in a
model membrane system and in living cells. This section has three parts:
A, B, and C.

SEMIPERMEABLE MEMBRANE.
Fashion a length of semipermeable dialysis tubing into a bag, and fill it
with two solutions: starch and glucose. Place the bag into a beaker that
contains Lugol’s iodine solution, and allow the system to stand for 30
minutes. The contents of the bag will turn blue-black because iodine
molecules are small enough to diffuse into the bag and react with the
starch.
