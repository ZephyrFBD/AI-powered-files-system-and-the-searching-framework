ms, especially chronic
diarrhea. Obviously, trying to treat this problem with antibiotics only makes it worse. However, it has been
successfully treated by giving the patients fecal transplants from healthy donors to reestablish the normal
intestinal microbial community. Scientists are also discovering that the absence of certain key microbes
from our intestinal tract may set us up for a variety of problems including obesity, insulin resistance, and
autoimmune disorders. Pictured here is a scanning electron micrograph of Clostridium difficile, a Gram-
positive, rod-shaped bacterium that causes severe diarrhea. Infection commonly occurs after the normal gut
