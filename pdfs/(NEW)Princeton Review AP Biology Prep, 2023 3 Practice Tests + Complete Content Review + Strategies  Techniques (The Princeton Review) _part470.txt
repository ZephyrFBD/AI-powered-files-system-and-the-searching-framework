e (n) refers to the number of members of the population that are included in the study. Sample size is
an important consideration when you’re trying to determine how well the data in the study represents a population.
Large sample sizes are always better, but for technical reasons, experiments can’t be infinitely large.
The mean (x) is the average of the sample, calculated by adding all of the individual values and dividing by the
number of values you have. The mean is not necessarily a number provided in the sample. You should be able to
recognize what the mean of a given dataset is and be able to calculate the mean using the equation on the AP
Biology Equations and Formulas sheet. One limitation of mean is that it is influenced by outliers, or numerical
observations that are far removed from the rest of the observations.
The standard deviation (s) can determine if numbers are packed together or dispersed, because it is a measure of
how much each individual number differs from the mea
