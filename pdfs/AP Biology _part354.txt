ort time. If scientists can master this technique, many lives will
be improved.
To prepare multiple copies of a gene itself for analysis. Since
most genes exist in only one copy on a chromosome, the ability to
make multiple copies is of great value as a research tool.
To engineer bacteria to clean up the environment. Scientists have
engineered many bacteria; one modified species can even eat toxic
waste.
The Technique of Gene Cloning
Isolate a gene of interest, for example, the gene for human insulin.
Insert the gene into a plasmid.
Insert the plasmid into a vector, a cell that will carry the plasmid,
such as a bacterium. To accomplish this, a bacterium must be made
competent, which means it must be able to take up a plasmid.

Clone the gene. As the bacteria reproduce themselves by fission,
the plasmid and the selected gene are also being cloned. Millions of
copies of the gene are produced.
Identify the bacteria that contain the selected
