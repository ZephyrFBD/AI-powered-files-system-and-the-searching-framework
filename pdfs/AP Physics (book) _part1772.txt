†The magnitude of the constant electric field between two parallel plates is given by 
where Q is the magnitude of the charge on each plate and A is the area of one plate. We show this in
the optional Section 16–12 on Gauss’s law.

16–9 Electric Fields and Conductors
We now discuss some properties of conductors. First, the electric field inside a
conductor is zero in the static situation—that is, when the charges are at rest. If
there were an electric field within a conductor, there would be a force on the free
electrons. The electrons would move until they re
