urs as follows:
1. Enzymes, called helicases, unwind the helix at the origins of replication and help break the hydrogen
bonds holding the strands together, creating a replication fork.
i.
Leading Strand—the daughter strand that is synthesized into the replication fork. This strand is
synthesized in a continuous fashion.
ii. Lagging Strand—the daughter strand that is synthesized away from the replication fork. This
strand is synthesized in a discontinuous fashion or in fragments called Okazaki fragments.
2. An enzyme called primase then synthesizes a short segment of RNA called a primer that is
complementary to nucleotides on the DNA strand.
3. DNA polymerases bind to each separated strand and begin adding the proper complementary
nucleotides to the primer to produce a new copy of each strand.
4. The bond formed between two nucleotides is a covalent bond between the deoxyribose sugar of one
and the phosphate of the other.
5. Another enzyme, called DNA ligase, helps seal gaps between th
