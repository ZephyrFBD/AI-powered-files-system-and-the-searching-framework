ake 1x buffer from the 50x stock, mix 100 mL of 50x 
TAE concentrate with 4,900 mL of distilled or deionized water. Mix for 1–2 minutes. 
This is a 1:50 dilution for a final volume of 5 L. 
For the four-station kit: To make 1x buffer from the 50x stock, mix 50 mL of 50x TAE 
concentrate with 2,450 mL of distilled or deionized water. Mix for 1–2 minutes. This is a 
1:50 dilution for a final volume of 2.5 L. 
■ Preparation of Agarose Solution/Casting Gels 
Prepare 0.8% agarose solution before class on Lab Day 1. You will use approximately 
50 mL of agarose per gel depending upon your electrophoresis apparatus. Prepare the 
agarose gel just before the lab and maintain it in its liquid state by placing it in a 55–65°C 
water bath. Cover the top of the agarose container (flask) to minimize evaporation. 
For eight-station kit: Add 5 grams of agarose to 625 mL of 1x TAE buffer that 
you prepared. Melt the agarose using a microwave (2–10 minutes) OR a hot plate 
with magnetic stir bar OR a boi
