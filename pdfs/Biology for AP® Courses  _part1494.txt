the molecule’s
double-helix shape and dimensions. The two strands that make up the double helix are complementary and anti-parallel in
nature. That is, one strand runs in the 5' to 3' direction, whereas the complementary strand runs in the 3' to 5' direction.
(The significance of directionality will be important when we explore how DNA copies itself.) DNA is a polymer of
nucleotides that consists of deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases—A, T, C, and G—with
a purine always pairing with a pyrimidine (as Chargaff found). The genetic “language” of DNA is found in sequences of
the nucleotides. During cell division each daughter cell receives a copy of DNA in a process called replication. In the years
since the discovery of the structure of DNA, many technologies, including DNA sequencing, have been developed that
enable us to better understand DNA and its role in our genomes.
