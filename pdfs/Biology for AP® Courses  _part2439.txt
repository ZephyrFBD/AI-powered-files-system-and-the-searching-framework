 back to the
5th century BC. Panspermia is the idea that life is distributed to different parts of the universe on objects
such as meteoroids and asteroids. If this were to occur, organic compounds and microorganisms would be
able to survive the extreme conditions of space.
However, in the 1960s, scientists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey conducted laboratory experiments that
showed it was possible for organic compounds, including amino acids, to be formed under certain conditions
from inorganic molecules and energy, both of which would have been present in the early conditions of
Earth. Subsequently, fossilized evidence of microbial mats by deep sea hydrothermal vents that dates back
3.5 billion years was discovered. Consequently, there are now several hypotheses regarding how life could
have evolved on Earth.
