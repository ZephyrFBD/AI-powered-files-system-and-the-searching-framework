r food with crop pests, most of which are insects. Pesticides control these competitors;
however, pesticides are costly and lose their effectiveness over time as pest populations adapt. They also lead to collateral
damage by killing non-pest species and risking the health of consumers and agricultural workers. Ecologists believe that
the bulk of the work in removing pests is actually done by predators and parasites of those pests, but the impact has not
been well studied. A review found that in 74 percent of studies that looked for an effect of landscape complexity on natural
enemies of pests, the greater the complexity, the greater the effect of pest-suppressing organisms. An experimental study
found that introducing multiple enemies of pea aphids (an important alfalfa pest) increased the yield of alfalfa significantly.
This study shows the importance of landscape diversity via the question of whether a diversity of pests is more effective at
control than one single pest; the results
