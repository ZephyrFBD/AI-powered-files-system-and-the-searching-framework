calculate the frequency of each
type and add that value to the table.
From these frequencies the probabilities of the A, B,
and O alleles in the population were determined as
shown in the table below.
Allele
probability
A
0.201
B
0.265
O
0.542

•
Using these probabilities calculate the expected
frequencies, E, of each blood type using
E(A) = (pA
2 + 2pA + 2pA pO)N
E(B) = (pB
2 + 2pB + 2pB pO)N
E(A/ B) = 2 · pa · pB · N
E(O) = pO
2 · N
Add these expected frequencies to the table.

Apply your understanding of the conceptual
foundation of these equations by restating in words
the relationship represented by E(A).
•
Apply a χ2 test at the 95% confidence level and 3
degrees of freedom (number of traits minus one) to
evaluate the claim that these data indicate Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium of the ABO system for this
population. The definition of the statistic
χ2 = ∑(O −E)2
