10. A noisy truck approaches you from behind a building. Ini-
tially you hear it but cannot see it. When it emerges and you
do see it, its sound is suddenly “brighter”—you hear more of
the high-frequency noise. Explain. [Hint: See Section 11–14
on diffraction.]
11. Standing waves can be said to be due to “interference in
space,” whereas beats can be said to be due to “interfer-
ence in time.” Explain.
12. In Fig. 12–16, if the frequency of the speakers is lowered,
would the points D and C (where destructive and con-
structive interference occur) move farther apart or closer
together? Explain.
13. Traditional methods of protecting the hearing of people who
work in areas with very high noise levels have consisted
mainly of efforts to block or reduce noise levels. With a
relatively new technology, headphones are worn that do
not block the ambient noise. Instead, a device is used which
detects the noise, inve
