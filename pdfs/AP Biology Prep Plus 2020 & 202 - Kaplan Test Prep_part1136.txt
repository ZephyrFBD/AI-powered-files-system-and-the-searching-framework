serve membrane-bound ribosomes, making (D) correct.
The DNA of prokaryotes is kept directly within the cytoplasmic region.
However, (A) would not be observed in eukaryotic cells, which house their
genetic material within a nucleus. Glycoproteins are found in eukaryotes
and play an important role in cell-to-cell signaling, but these proteins are
located on the outer surface of the membrane, so (B) is also incorrect. (C)
would also be unique to prokaryotes because the lack of membrane-
bound organelles results in ribosomes only free-floating in the cytosol.
5. D
Speciation can occur when a small group breaks oﬀ from the main group.
Aȇer several more generations, the new species will become
reproductively isolated from the main species and speciation will have
occurred. Thus, (D) is correct. It is highly unlikely that the male Boundary
Waters grizzled skipper is sterile since that population of butterfly had not
died out; therefore, (A) is incorrect. (B) can be eliminated because the
