nformation breach their rigid
perceptions. He was writing long before ‘Covid’, but I think you will
recognise followers of the ‘Covid’ religion oh just a little bit:
People who are channelling the vibratory frequency of wetiko align with each other through
psychic resonance to reinforce their unspoken shared agreement so as to uphold their
deranged view of reality. Once an unconscious content takes possession of certain
individuals, it irresistibly draws them together by mutual attraction and knits them into groups
tied together by their shared madness that can easily swell into an avalanche of insanity.
A psychic epidemic is a closed system, which is to say that it is insular and not open to any
new information or informing influences from the outside world which contradict its fixed,
limited, and limiting perspective.
There we have the Woke mind and the ‘Covid’ mind. Compatible
resonance draws the awakening together, too, which is clearly
happening today.
