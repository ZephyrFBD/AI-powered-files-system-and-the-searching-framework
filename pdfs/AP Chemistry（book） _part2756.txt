SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 17.12 
Calculating Solubility from Ksp
for the dissolution and set up a table of initial and equilibrium 
concentrations. We then use the equilibrium-constant expression. 
In this case we know Ksp, and so we solve for the concentrations of 
the ions in solution. Once we know these concentrations, we use 
the formula weight to determine solubility in g>L.
Solve
Assume that initially no salt has dissolved, 
and then allow x mol/L of CaF2 to dissociate 
completely when equilibrium is achieved:
CaF21s2 ∆ Ca2 +1aq2 + 2 F-1aq2

The stoichiometry of the equilibrium dictates 
that 2x mol>L of F- are produced for each 
x mol>L of CaF2 that dissolve. We now use the 
expression for Ksp and substitute the equilib-
rium concentrations to solve for the value of x:
