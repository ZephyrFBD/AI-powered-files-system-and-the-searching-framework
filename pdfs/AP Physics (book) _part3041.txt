udy of the surface structure
of materials. The “topographic” image of a surface actually represents the
distribution of electron charge.
The atomic force microscope (AFM), developed in the 1980s, is in many
ways similar to an STM, but can be used on a wider range of sample materials.
Instead of detecting an electric current, the AFM measures the force between a
cantilevered tip and the sample, a force which depends strongly on the
tip–sample separation at each point. The tip is moved as for the STM.
27–10 Early Models of the Atom
The idea that matter is made up of atoms was accepted by most scientists by 1900.
With the discovery of the electron in the 1890s, scientists began to think of the atom
itself as having a structure with electrons as part of that structure. We now discuss
how our modern view of the atom developed, and the quantum theory with which
it is intertwined.†
A typical model of the atom in the 1890s visualized the atom as a homogene-
ous sphere of positive charge inside
