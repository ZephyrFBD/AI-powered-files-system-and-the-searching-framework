A student formulated a hypothesis that water-soluble pollutants damage living organisms by increasing the 
permeability of cellular membranes. To test the hypothesis, the student investigated the effect of isopropanol and 
acetone on beet root cells. The vacuoles of beet root cells contain large amounts of betacyanin, a water-soluble 
pigment that is released into the extracellular environment
