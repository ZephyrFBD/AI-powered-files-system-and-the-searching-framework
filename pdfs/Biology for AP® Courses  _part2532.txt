abiotically. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes. After photosynthesis, BNF is the
second most important biological process on Earth. The most important source of BNF is the symbiotic interaction
between soil bacteria and legume plants.
Microbial bioremediation is the use of microbial metabolism to remove pollutants. Bioremediation has been used to
remove agricultural chemicals that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface. Toxic metals and oxides, such as
selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be removed by bioremediation. Probably one of the most useful and interesting
examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the cleanup of oil spills.
Human life is only possible due to the action of microbes, both those in the environment and those species that call us
home. Internally, they help us digest our food, produce crucial nutrients for us, protect us from pathogenic microbes, and
help train our immune syste
