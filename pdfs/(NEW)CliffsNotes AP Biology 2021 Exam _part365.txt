plasmid fragments.
4. Apply DNA ligase to stabilize attachments. Some of the plasmids, by chance, are now recombinant plasmids
containing the foreign gene. Other plasmids will not contain the foreign gene.
5. Mix plasmids with bacteria to allow transformation. Some of the bacteria will absorb the plasmids
(transformation). Some bacteria will absorb recombinant plasmids. Others will absorb nonrecombinant plasmids.
6. Grow the transformed bacteria in the presence of ampicillin and X-gal. Only bacteria that have absorbed a
plasmid (transformed bacteria) will grow in the presence of ampicillin because only the
introduced plasmids contain the ampR gene. Of those bacteria, only bacteria that have absorbed a recombinant
plasmid will be white because they lack a functioning lac Z gene. For these bacteria, the foreign DNA was inserted
within the lac Z gene of the plasmid, making the gene dysfunctional. Bacteria that absorbed a non recombinant
plasmid have a functioning lac Z gene and turn X-gal
