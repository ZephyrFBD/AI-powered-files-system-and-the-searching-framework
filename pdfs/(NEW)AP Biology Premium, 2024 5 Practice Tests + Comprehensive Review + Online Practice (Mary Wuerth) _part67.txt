and hydrogen are
unequally shared, with the electrons spending more time around the oxygen atom. This results in a polar covalent
bond, with a partial negative charge around the oxygen atom and a partial positive charge around the hydrogen
atom, as shown in Figure 3.1.
Figure 3.1 Polarity of Water
As a result, the partial negative charge on an oxygen atom in one water molecule is attracted to the partial
positive charge on a hydrogen atom in another water molecule, resulting in a hydrogen bond. This causes water
molecules to be attracted to one another, as shown in Figure 3.2.
Figure 3.2 Hydrogen Bonds Between Water Molecules
Since water molecules can form hydrogen bonds, they have properties that help sustain life on Earth, including:
Exhibiting cohesive and adhesive behavior: Water molecules are “sticky.” They are attracted to other water
molecules and to other polar molecules. This is what gives water its unique properties like water’s high surface
tension and its ability to climb u
