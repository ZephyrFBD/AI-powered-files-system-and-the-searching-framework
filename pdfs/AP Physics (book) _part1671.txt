els in cars, power plants, and industrial furnaces—gives rise to smog and other
problems. Another issue is the buildup of CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the
burning of fossil fuels; the carbon in them combines with O2 of the air, forming CO2.
This CO2 absorbs some of the infrared radiation that the Earth naturally emits
(Section 14–8), and thus contributes to global warming. The carbon footprint of
any activity (home appliances,steel production, manufacture of goods, transportation)
refers to the negative impact on the environment due to the burning of fossil fuels
which release CO2 (and other noxious products) into the atmosphere, contributing
to climate change. A carbon footprint can be expressed in kg or tons of carbon
(in the CO2). Limiting the burning of fossil fuels can help reduce these problems.
Thermal pollution, however, is unavoidable. Engineers can try to design and
build engines that are more efficient, but they cannot surpass the Carnot efficiency
and must live with
