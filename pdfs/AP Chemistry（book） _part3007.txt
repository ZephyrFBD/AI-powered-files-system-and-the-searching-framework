from the higher temperature (greater average kinetic energy) to lower temperature (lesser 
average kinetic energy) until the tea and its surroundings reach the same temperature. This 
natural tendency for energy to spread from a more concentrated form to a less concentrated 
form renders some of the energy unavailable to do work. Interestingly, a reversible process 
produces the maximum amount of work that can be done by a system on its surroundings.

Entropy and the Second Law  
of Thermodynamics
In order to apply what we have learned about irreversible processes to predict whether 
an unfamiliar process is spontaneous, we must examine the thermodynamic quantity 
called entropy. 
 (Section 13.1)
Entropy is a measure of the tendency for energy to spread or disperse, thereby 
reducing its ability to accomplish work. In a general sense, it reflects the degree of 
 
randomness or disorder associated with the particles that carry the energy.
In this section, we consider how
