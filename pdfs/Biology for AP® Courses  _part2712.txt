igest the insect. The released
nutrients are absorbed by the leaves, which reopen for the next meal.
The mimosa plant is also known as the sensitive plant, because its leaves are sensitive to touch and will
fold inward and droop. Leaves in their normal state are shown on the left.

Thigmomorphogenesis is a slow developmental change in the shape of a plant subjected to continuous mechanical stress.
When trees bend in the wind, for example, growth is usually stunted and the trunk thickens. Strengthening tissue, especially
xylem, is produced to add stiffness to resist the windâ€™s force. Researchers hypothesize that mechanical strain induces growth
and differentiation to strengthen the tissues. Ethylene and jasmonate are likely involved in thigmomorphogenesis.
