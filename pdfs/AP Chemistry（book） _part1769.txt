n this curve where the vapor pressure 
is 1 atm is the normal boiling point of the substance. The vapor-pressure curve ends 
at the critical point (C), which corresponds to the critical temperature and critical 
pressure of the substance. At temperatures and pressures beyond the critical point, 
the liquid and gas phases are indistinguishable from each other, and the substance 
is a supercritical fluid.
2. The green curve, the sublimation curve, separates the solid phase from the gas phase 
and represents the change in the vapor pressure of the solid as it sublimes at dif-
ferent temperatures. Each point on this curve represents a condition of equilibrium 
between the solid and the gas.
3.  
The blue curve, the melting curve, separates the solid phase from the liquid phase 
and represents the change in melting point of the solid with increasing pressure. 
Each point on this curve represents an equilibrium between the solid and the liq-
uid. This curve usually slopes slightly to the rig
