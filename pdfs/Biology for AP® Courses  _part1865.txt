can be inserted. Restriction enzymes
stitch together the new gene to the existing piece of DNA.
c.
Restriction enzymes splice DNA at a specific point, so the new piece of DNA can be inserted. DNA ligase
stitches together the new foreign gene to the existing piece of DNA.
d.
Restriction enzymes splice the existing piece of DNA only to accommodate the new piece of DNA. DNA
ligase ligates the new DNA with the existing DNA.
Activity
Cloning can be used to quickly replicate crop plants that have advantageous genes, such as greater disease
resistance or greater fruit production. However, cloning also produces crop plants that have little genetic
variation. In a group, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using clones as human food sources in
an era where the Earth is undergoing a period of climate change. How well will cloned populations of crop
plants be able to adapt to climate change, compared to non-clone crop plants? Then, defend your groupâ€™s
position against those of other group
