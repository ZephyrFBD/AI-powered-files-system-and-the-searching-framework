in circuits in this Chapter. (The large triangle is an amplifier
chip containing transistors.) We also discuss how voltmeters
and ammeters work, and how measurements affect the
quantity being measured.

lectric circuits are basic parts of all electronic devices from cell phones and
TV sets to computers and automobiles. Scientific measurements—whether in
physics, biology, or medicine—make use of electric circuits. In Chapter 18,
we discussed the basic principles of electric current. Now we apply these princi-
ples to analyze dc circuits involving combinations of batteries, resistors, and
capacitors. We also study the operation of some useful instruments.†
When we draw a diagram for a circuit, we represent batteries, capacitors, and
resistors by the symbols shown in Table 19–1. Wires whose resistance is negligible
compared with other resistance in the circuit are drawn as straight lines. A ground
symbol (
or 
) may mean a real connection to the ground, perhap
