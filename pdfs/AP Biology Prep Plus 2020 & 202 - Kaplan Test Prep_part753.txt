11. While developing a cladogram from genetic data, a researcher
discovers that one organism, organism X, has diﬀerent physical
characteristics from those clustered nearby on the cladogram. All
of the nearby organisms originate from the same node as
organism X. Which of the following is most likely true regarding
organism X?
Organism X must have diverged long before the nearby
organisms.
(A)
Organism X does not share a common ancestor with the
nearby organisms.
(B)
Organism X may have diverged in appearance, but its recent
common ancestry with nearby organisms suggests they are
still closely-related.
(C)
It is likely that organism X has been placed incorrectly on the
cladogram because those placed close toget
