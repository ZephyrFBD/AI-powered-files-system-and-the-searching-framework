. Electrons
emitted by a heated filament in a vacuum
tube are accelerated by a high voltage.
When they strike the surface of the
anode, the “target,” X-rays are emitted.

Investigations into the nature of X-rays indicated they were not charged par-
ticles (such as electrons) since they could not be deflected by electric or magnetic
fields. It was suggested that they might be a form of invisible light. However,
they showed no diffraction or interference effects using ordinary gratings.
Indeed, if their wavelengths were much smaller than the typical grating spacing
of 
no effects would be expected. Around 1912, Max von Laue
(1879–1960) suggested that if the atoms in a crystal were arranged in a regular
array (see Fig. 13–2a), such a crystal might serve as a diffraction grating for very
short wavelengths on the order of the spacing between atoms, estimated to be
about 
Experiments soon showed that X-rays scattered
