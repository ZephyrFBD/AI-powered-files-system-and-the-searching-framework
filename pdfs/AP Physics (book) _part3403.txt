e mass of a stable nucleus is less than the sum of the
masses of its constituent nucleons. The difference in mass
(times 
) is the total binding energy. It represents the energy
needed to break the nucleus into its constituent nucleons.
The binding energy per nucleon averages about 8 MeV per
nucleon, and is lowest for low mass and high mass nuclei.
Unstable nuclei undergo radioactive decay; they change
into other nuclei with the emission of an 
or 
particle.
An 
particle is a 
nucleus; a 
particle is an electron or
positron; and a 
ray is a high-energy photon. In 
decay,
a neutrino is also emitted. The transformation of parent nuclei
into daughter nuclei is called transmutation of the elements.
Radioactive decay occurs spontaneously only when the mass
of the products is less than the mass of the parent nucleus.
The loss in mass appears as kinetic energy of the products.
Nuclei are held together by the strong nuclear force. The
weak nuclear force makes itself apparent in decay. These tw
