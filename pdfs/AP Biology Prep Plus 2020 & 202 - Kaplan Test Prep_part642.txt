 polygenic trait.
Genetic recombination is a molecular process by which an
organism’s genes are rearranged in its oﬀspring. Through this
process, two alleles can be separated and replaced by diﬀerent
alleles, thereby changing the genetic makeup but preserving
the structure of the gene. Chromosomal crossing over is an
example of a mechanism by which this process takes place.
Gene transfer can be vertical or horizontal. Vertical gene
transfer occurs when an organism receives genetic material
(i.e., DNA) from a parent organism or from a predecessor
species. Horizontal gene transfer occurs when an organism
transfers genetic material to cells that are not its oﬀspring.
Examples of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria were
discussed in chapter 6.

Chromosomes are the basic units of inheritance. How they
reorganize and combine directly influences the genetic
material present in an oﬀspring.
