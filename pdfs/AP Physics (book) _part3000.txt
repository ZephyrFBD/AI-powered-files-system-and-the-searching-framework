Fig. 27–4. In the visible region, the curve will be descending, so the shortest visible
wavelengths will be strongest. Hence the star will appear bluish (or blue-white).
NOTE This example helps us to understand why stars have different colors
(reddish for the coolest stars; orangish, yellow, white, bluish for “hotter” stars.)

Planck’s Quantum Hypothesis
In the year 1900, Max Planck (1858–1947) proposed a theory that was able to
reproduce the graphs of Fi
