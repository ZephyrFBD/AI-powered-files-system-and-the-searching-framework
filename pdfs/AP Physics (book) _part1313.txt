e ED is equal to AD. Thus we see that if the distance BE
is equal to precisely one-half the wavelength of the sound, the two waves will be
exactly out of phase when they reach D, and destructive interference occurs.
This then is the criterion for determining at what points destructive interference
occurs: destructive interference occurs at any point whose distance from one
speaker is one-half wavelength greater than its distance from the other speaker.
Notice that if this extra distance (BE in Fig. 12–17b) is equal to a whole wave-
length (or 2, 3,
wavelengths), then the two waves will be in phase and
constructive interference occurs. If the distance BE equals
wave-
lengths, destructive interference occurs.
It is important to realize that a person sitting at point D in Fig. 12–16 or
12–17 hears nothing at all (or nearly so), yet sound is coming from both speakers.
Indeed, if one of the speakers is turned off, the sound from the other speaker will
be clearly heard.
If a loudspeaker emit
