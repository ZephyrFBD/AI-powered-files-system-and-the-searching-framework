students might simply buy a few 
packages of seeds of a particular leafy vegetable, root vegetable, tomato, etc., and then 
grow them in varying conditions (salinities, temperatures, and so forth). Other students 
may choose to do nonlab mini-research projects on the topic. Although the links among 
growth, environment, and enzymes are more difficult to connect, regardless of their 
approach, students are establishing a protocol to do further work on those plants that 
vary tremendously from each other. 
■ Summative Assessment 
1. Review the learning objectives and students’ answers to analysis questions that you 
ask. Do students understand the concepts? You can use the learning objectives to 
generate questions. 
2. Review the students’ experimental evidence. Did they make the appropriate 
measurements and graphs to reflect their results? Can they draw conclusions from 
their data? 
3. Have the students prepare laboratory notebooks and record their experimental 
designs, data, graphs
