exam. The most important things to know are why DNA replication is considered semiconservative and the differences between leading and
lagging strand replication. Make sure you understand the functions of helicase, topoisomerase, DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase, and
ligase in this process.
On one strand of the double helix, DNA polymerase reads the original strand in the 3′ to 5′ direction and can add
new nucleotides continuously in the 5′ to 3′ direction. This process is called leading strand replication.
However, the other strand of the double helix is oriented in the 5′ to 3′ direction, which makes the replication
process on this strand more complicated. On this strand, DNA polymerase must proceed in the opposite direction in
order to read the strand in the 3′ to 5′ direction. Replication on this strand occurs discontinuously, producing short
fragments called lagging strand fragments (also known as Okazaki fragments), which are then joined together by the
enzyme
