Hg, will sink; the least dense, cyclohexane, will ﬂoat; H2O will be in 
the middle. 1.82 density of solid = 1.63 g/mL 1.85 (a) Density of 
peat = 0.13 g/cm3, density of soil = 2.5g/cm3. It is not correct to say 
that peat is “lighter” than topsoil. Volumes must be speciﬁed in order 
to compare masses. (b) Buy 16 bags of peat (more than 15 are needed).

diameter of the tube is 1.71 cm. 1.91 The separation with distinctly 
separated red and blue spots is more successful. To quantify the char-
acteristics of the separation, calculate a reference value for each spot: 
distance traveled by spot/distance traveled by solvent. If the values 
for the two  spots are fairly
