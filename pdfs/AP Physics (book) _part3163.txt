EXERCISE F Write the complete ground-state configuration for gallium, with its 31
electrons.
The grouping of atoms in the Periodic Table is according to increasing atomic
number, Z. It was designed to also show regularity according to chemical prop-
erties. Although this is treated in chemistry textbooks, we discuss it here briefly
because it is a result of quantum mechanics. See the Periodic Table inside the
back cover.
All the noble gases (in column VIII of the Periodic Table) have completely
filled shells or subshells. That is, their outermost subshell is completely full, and
the electron distribution is spherically symmetric. With such full spherical sym-
metry, other electrons are n
