Energy is harvested during cellular respiration in stages. Which of
the following correctly states which stage of cellular respiration
harvests the most energy and provides the correct explanation for
why that occurs?
The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because it
is here that pyruvate is completely broken down into CO2.
The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because, in
addition to the production of ATP, both FADH2 and NADH are
produced. Each of those molecules will release 2 ATPs and 3
ATPs, respectively.
The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation

because, in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP,
all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH2 is
transferred to ATP.
