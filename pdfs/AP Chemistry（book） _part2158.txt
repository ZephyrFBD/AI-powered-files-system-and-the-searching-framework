(e) How many mL of a concentrated 18.0 M HCl aque-

(a “kilo”) of the free-base form of cocaine into its hydro-
chloride form?
 13.92  A supersaturated solution of sucrose (C12H22O11) is made 
by dissolving sucrose in hot water and slowly letting the 
solution cool to room temperature. After a long time, the 
excess sucrose crystallizes out of the solution. Indicate 
whether each of the following statements is true or false:
(a) After the excess sucrose has crystallized out, the remain-
ing solution is saturated.
(b) After the excess sucrose has crystallized out, the system 
is now unstable and is not in equilibrium.
(c) After the excess sucrose has crystallized out, the rate of 
sucrose molecules leaving the surface of the crystals to 
be hydrated by water is equal to the rate of sucrose mol-
ecules in water attaching to the surface of the crystals.
