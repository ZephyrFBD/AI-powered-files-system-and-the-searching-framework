essive disorder. Homozygous recessive individuals have red blood cells
that can assume a sickle shape when oxygen levels are low. These sickled blood cells can cause blockages in
blood vessels, leading to pain and possibly fatal complications. Heterozygous individuals do not suffer the pain
or complications from sickle cell disease and are more resistant to malaria than individuals with two nonsickle
alleles. The following figure shows the pattern of inheritance of sickle cell disease through three generations of
a family. Squares indicate males, circles indicate females, and shaded shapes indicate individuals who have
sickle cell disease.
(a) Describe the genotype of individual I-2. Justify your answer with evidence from the pedigree.
(b) What is the genotype of individual III-6? Explain how you know her genotype.
(c) Create a Punnett square that represents the possible genotypes of the offspring of individuals 1 and 2 from
generation I.
(d) Explain which genotype from this pedigree w
