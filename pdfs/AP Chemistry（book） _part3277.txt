ucts of the two-electron 
reduction of FeF21s2 in water. (b) Use the Ksp value and the standard reduction potential of Fe2+1aq2 to calculate the standard 
reduction potential for the half-reaction in part (a). (c) Rationalize the difference between the reduction potential in part (a) and 
the reduction potential for Fe2+1aq2.

(a) Iron(II) ﬂuoride is an ionic substance that 
consists of Fe2+ and F- ions. We are asked to 
predict where two electrons could be added 
to FeF2. We cannot envision adding the elec-
trons to the F- ions to form F2 -, so it seems 
likely that we could reduce the Fe2+ ions to 
Fe1s2. We therefore predict the half-reaction:
Analyze We are going to combine what we know about equi-
librium constants and electrochemistry to obtain reduction 
potentials.
Plan For (a) we need to determine which ion, Fe2+ or F -, is more 
likely to be reduced by two electrons and complete the overall 
reaction FeF2 + 2 e- ¡ ?. For (b) we need to write the chemical 
equation associ
