 vast amount of data generated for proteomic analysis.
Genomic- and proteomic-scale analyses are part of systems biology. Systems biology is the study of whole biological
systems (genomes and proteomes) based on interactions within the system. The European Bioinformatics Institute and the
Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) are developing and establishing effective tools to sort through the enormous pile
of systems biology data. Because proteins are the direct products of genes and reflect activity at the genomic level, it is
natural to use proteomes to compare the protein profiles of different cells to identify proteins and genes involved in disease
processes. Most pharmaceutical drug trials target proteins. Information obtained from proteomics is being used to identify
novel drugs and understand their mechanisms of action.
Figure 17.16 Two-hybrid screening is used to determine whether two proteins interact. In this method, a transcription
factor is split into a DNA-binding domain (BD)
