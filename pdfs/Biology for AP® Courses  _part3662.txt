The graph plots percent oxygen saturation of hemoglobin
as a function of oxygen partial pressure in the alveoli.
Oxygen saturation increases in an S-shaped curve, from 0
to 100 percent as the partial pressure of oxygen increases
from 0 to 100. What happens as the curve levels off
around a partial pressure of 60 mmHg?
a.
As the percent saturation of hemoglobin
increases to its maximum, hemoglobin’s affinity
for oxygen increases as the availability of
oxygen increases.
b.
As the percent saturation of hemoglobin
decreases (without all of the oxygen
dissociating), hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen
decreases as the availability of oxygen
decreases.
c.
As the percent saturation of hemoglobin
increases to very high levels, hemoglobin’s
