In 2012 it was used to provide
evidence for the Higgs boson. Note

32–2 Beginnings of Elementary 
Particle Physics—Particle Exchange
The accepted model for elementary particles today views quarks and leptons as
the fundamental constituents of ordinary matter. To understand our present-day
view of elementary particles, it is necessary to understand the ideas leading up to
its formulation.
Elementary particle physics might be said to have begun in 1935 when the
Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa (1907–1981) predicted the existence of a new
particle that would in some way mediate the strong nuclear force. To understand
Yukawa’s idea, we first consider the electromagnetic force. When we first dis-
cussed electricity, we saw that the electric force acts over a distance, without
contact. To better perceive how a force can act ove
