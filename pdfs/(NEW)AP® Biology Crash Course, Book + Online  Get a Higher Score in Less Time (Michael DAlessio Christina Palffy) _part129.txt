ger. This was when there was less
rain (1950 and 1980) and seed sizes change due to the amount of rain. The long-beaked finches
that survive in 1950 and 1980 are able to eat seeds that are available in the dry season. A larger
beak indicates a selective advantage. However, when the rainy season comes, different seeds are
available, and finches with smaller beaks are better able to get food in order to survive and
reproduce.
Below is hypothetical data: Dry seasons are 1950 and 1980; wet seasons are 1960, 1970,
1990, and 2000.
Darwinian biology permeates all aspects of biology. Early theories of evolution can make up a series of questions on the AP®
Biology exam. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the major evolutionary theories for the exam. Remember that the term
“fitness” means an organism’s ability to survive to reproduce.
