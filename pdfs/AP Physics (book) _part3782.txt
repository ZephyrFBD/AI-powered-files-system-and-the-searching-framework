Stars are believed to begin life as collapsing masses of gas
(protostars), largely hydrogen. As they contract, they heat up
(potential energy is transformed to kinetic energy). When the
temperature reaches about 10 million degrees, nuclear fusion
begins and forms heavier elements (nucleosynthesis), mainly
helium at first. The energy released during these reactions
heats the gas so its outward pressure balances the inward grav-
itational force, and the young star stabilizes as a main-sequence
star. The tremendous luminosity of stars comes from the energy
released during these thermonuclear reactions. After billions
of years, as helium is collected in the core and hydrogen is used
up, the core contracts and heats further. The outer envelope
expands and cools, and the star becomes a red giant (larger
diameter, redder color).
The next stage of stellar evolution depends on the mass of
the star, which may have lost much of its original mass as its
outer envelope escaped into space. Stars o
