pulls his or her hand away. Even humans, with our great
capacity to learn, still exhibit a variety of innate behaviors.
Kinesis and Taxis
Another activity or movement of innate behavior is kinesis, or the undirected movement in response to a stimulus.
Orthokinesis is the increased or decreased speed of movement of an organism in response to a stimulus. Woodlice, for
example, increase their speed of movement when exposed to high or low temperatures. This movement, although random,
increases the probability that the insect spends less time in the unfavorable environment. Another example is klinokinesis,
an increase in turning behaviors. It is exhibited by bacteria such as E. coli which, in association with orthokinesis, helps the
organisms randomly find a more hospitable environment.
A similar, but more directed version of kinesis is taxis: the directed movement towards or away from a stimulus. This
movement can be in response to light (phototaxis), chemical signals (chemotaxis), or grav
