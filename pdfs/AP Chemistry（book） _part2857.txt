 1 ppm means one part by volume in 1 million vol-
umes of the whole. Because volume is proportional to number of moles of gas via the 
ideal-gas equation 1PV = nRT2, volume fraction and mole fraction are the same. Thus, 
1 ppm of a trace constituent of the atmosphere amounts to 1 mol of that constitu-
ent in 1 million moles of air; that is, the concentration in parts per million is equal to 
the mole fraction times 106. For example, Table 18.1 lists the mole fraction of CO2 in 
the atmosphere as 0.000400, which means its concentration in parts per million is 
0.000400 * 106 = 400 ppm.

CHAPTER 18 Chemistry of the Environment
Other minor constituents of the troposphere, in addition to CO2, are listed in 
 
Table 18.2.
Before we consider the chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere, letâ€™s review 
some of the properties of the two major components, N2 and O2. Recall that the N2 mol-
ecule possesses a triple bond between the nitrogen atoms. 
 (Section 8.3) This very 
strong bond
