lest particles (quarks, leptons)
are “strings” with lengths on the order of the Planck length,
These theories also suggest that the “Big Bang,”
with which the universe is believed to have begun, started
from an initial size on the order of the Planck length.]

40. Global positioning satellites (GPS) can be used to determine
your position with great accuracy. If one of the satellites is
20,000 km from you, and you want to know your position to
what percent uncertainty in the distance is required?
How many significant figures are needed in the distance?

wafers of thickness 0.300 mm that are sliced from a solid
cylindrical silicon crystal of length 25 cm. If each wafer can
hold 400 chips, what is the max
