bides that formally 
contain C4 -  ions are observed only in the case of a few compounds of carbon with very 
active metals. Formation of 4+ ions by electron loss is not observed for any of these ele-
ments; the ionization energies are too high. The +4 oxidation state is common, how-
ever, and is found in the vast majority of the compounds of the group 4A elements. The 
+2 oxidation state is found in the chemistry of germanium, tin, and lead, however, 
and it is the principal oxidation state for lead. Carbon usually forms a maximum of 
four bonds. The other members of the family are able to form more than four bonds. 
 
 (Section 8.7)
Table 22.8 shows that the strength of a bond between two atoms of a given element 
decreases as we go down group 4A. Carbonâ€“carbon bonds are quite strong. Carbon, there-
fore, has a striking ability to form compounds in which carbon atoms are bonded to one 
another in extended chains and rings, which accounts for the large number of organic 
compounds tha
