■ General Safety Precautions 
When growing plants under lights, be careful to avoid any situation where water or 
fertilizer could come in contact with the electrical wires. 
■ THE INVESTIGATIONS 
■ Getting Started 
In On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin used artificial selection — the kind 
of selection that is used to develop domestic breeds of animals and plants — as a 
way to understand and explain natural selection. Like natural selection, artificial 
selection requires variation in the population under selection. For selection to work, 
the variations must be inheritable. To conduct artificial selection, humans decide 
on a specific trait of a plant or animal to enhance or diminish and then select which 
individuals with that desired trait will breed, producing the next generation and the next 
population.
