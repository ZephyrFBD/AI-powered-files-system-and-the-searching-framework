rgy from different compounds.
b.
ATP energy cannot activate the ROS dependent
stress response whereas food molecules are
responsible for activating ROS.
c.
ATP is low in energy, but food molecules
possess higher levels of energy that cells can
use.
d.
ATP is readily available to cells, unlike
compounds that have to first be phosphorylated
in order to release their energy.
