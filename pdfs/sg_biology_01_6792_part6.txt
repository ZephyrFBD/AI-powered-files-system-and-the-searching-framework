cceptable: Chorionic villus 
Finger-like projection in the 
placenta 
 
 
* Absorption of digested material 
(nutrients) 
• increase surface area 
• secrete mucus 
 
 
 
 
Maternal-fetal exchange for 
nutrients, gases, etc. 
 
* Increases amount of surface area 
for absorption of nutrients in 
digestive system 
 
 
 
 
 
Increases surface area for 
exchange in the reproductive 
system during fetal development 
Capillary 
* Small(est) blood vessel (i.e., tiny 
tubes carrying blood) 
• one-cell layer 
• simple squamous epithelial 
(endothelium) 
• porous (fenestrated) 
• connects arterioles 
(arteries,metarterioles) to venules 
(veins) 
 
 
* Movement of material (gases, 
nutrients, wastes, hormones, etc.) 
across capillary membrane  
• increases surface area 
• blood cells moving through one  
at a time 
• low pressure 
• slowest velocity of blood 
• allows passage (conduit) for  
white blood cells 
• heat dissipation 
 
 
* Increases vessel contact with all 
body cells for the exchange
