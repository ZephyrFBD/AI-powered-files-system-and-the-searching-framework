far less important in the chemistries of these other elements. The Si¬Si bond strength 
1226 kJ>mol2, for example, is much lower than the Si¬O bond strength 1386 kJ>mol2. 
As a result, the chemistry of silicon is dominated by the formation of Si¬O bonds, and 
Si¬Si bonds play a minor role.
Occurrence and Preparation of Silicon
Silicon is the second most abundant element, after oxygen, in Earth’s crust. It occurs 
in SiO2 and in an enormous variety of silicate minerals. The element is obtained by the 
reduction of molten silicon dioxide with carbon at high temperature:
 
SiO21l2 + 2 C1s2 ¡ Si1l2 + 2 CO1g2

Elemental silicon has a diamond-like structure. Crystalline silicon is a gray metallic- 
looking solid that melts at 1410 °C. The element is a semiconductor, as we saw in Chap-
ters 7 and 12, and is used
