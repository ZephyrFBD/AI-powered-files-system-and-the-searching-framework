period of 
24 h. Assume the electrolytic cell is 85% efficient. (b) What 
is the minimum voltage required to drive the reaction?
 20.94  Elemental calcium is produced by the electrolysis of mol-
ten CaCl2. (a) What mass of calcium can be produced 
by this process if a current of 7.5 * 103 A is applied for 
48 h? Assume that the electrolytic cell is 68% efficient. 
(b) What is the minimum voltage needed to cause the 
electrolysis?
 20.95  Metallic gold is collected from below the anode when a 
mixture of copper and gold metals is refined by electrolysis. 
Explain this behavior.
 20.96  A mixture of copper and gold metals that is subjected to 
electrorefining contains tellurium as an impurity. The stan-
dard reduction potential between tellurium and its lowest 
common oxidation state, Te4+, is
Te4+1aq2 + 4 e- ¡ Te1s2 E°
red = 0.57 V
Given this information, describe the probable fate of tellu-
rium impurities during electroreﬁning. Do the impurities 
fall to the bottom of the reﬁning bath
