Note that Eq. 5–5 does not give precise values for g at different locations
because the Earth is not a perfect sphere. The Earth not only has mountains and
valleys, and it bulges at the equator, but also its mass is not distributed precisely 
uniformly. (See Table 5–1.) The Earth’s rotation also affects the value of g. However,
for most practical purposes, when an object is near the Earth’s surface, we will
simply use  
and write the weight of an object as mg.
g = 9.80 ms2
EXERCISE E Suppose you could double the mass of a planet but keep its volume the
same. How would the acceleration of gravity, g, at the surface change?
