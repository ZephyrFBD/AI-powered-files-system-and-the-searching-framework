or volts, with italic V for voltage.)
If we wish to speak of the potential 
at some point a, we must be aware 
that 
depends on where the potential is chosen to be zero. The zero for electric
potential in a given situation can be chosen arbitrarily, just as for potential energy,
because only differences in potential energy can be measured. Often the ground,
or a conductor connected directly to the ground (the Earth), is taken as zero
potential, and other potentials are given with respect to ground. (Thus, a point
where the voltage is 50 V is one where the difference of potential between it and
ground is 50 V.) In other cases, as we shall see, we may choose the potential to be
zero at an infinite distance.
