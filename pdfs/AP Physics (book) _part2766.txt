often an average with nearest-neighbor colors to reduce memory size

compression, see page 489).
Each different color of pixel in a Bayer array is counted as a separate pixel.
In contrast, in an LCD screen (Sections 17–11 and 24–11), a group of three
subpixels is counted as one pixel, a more conservative count.
An alternative technology, called “Foveon,” uses a semiconductor layer sys-
tem. Different wavelengths of light penetrate silicon to different depths, as shown in
Fig. 25–3: blue wavelengths are absorbed in the top layer, allowing green and red
light to pass through. Longer wavelengths (green) are absorbed in the second
layer, and the bottom layer detects the longest wavelengths (red). All three colors
are detected by each “tri-pixel” site, resulting in better color resolution and fewer
artifacts.
Digital Artifacts
Digital cameras can produce image artifacts (artificial effects in the image not
present in the original) resulting from the electronic sensing of the image. One
