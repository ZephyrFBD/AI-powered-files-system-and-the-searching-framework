Because amino acid-derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not lipid-soluble, they bind to plasma membrane
hormone receptors located on the outer surface of the membrane. Unlike steroid hormones, they cannot act directly on
DNA but activate a signaling pathway; this triggers intracellular activity and carries out the specific effects associated with
the hormone. The hormone that initiated the signaling pathway is called a first messenger. In the case of the epinephrine
signaling pathway, binding of the amino acid-derived hormone epinephrine to its receptor activates a G-protein which, in
turn, activates cAMP, a second messenger, ultimately resulting in a cellular response such as the conversion of glycogen to
glucose.
