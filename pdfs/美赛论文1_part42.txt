ication. Our model can be applied not only in the evaluation of 
sustainable development but also in the evaluation of other kinds of indexes, such 
as grade calculation, the assessment of annual benefit of a company and so on. 
 
6.2 Weaknesses 
 Parameters. There are quite a few parameters in our model. Irrationality and 
error in setting parameters can be easily added up exponentially. In the end, it will 
influence the evaluation results greatly. 
 Inconsistency. Although we set scientific standards, follow the opinions of the 
majority and sum up from the historical data during data selection, weight setting 
and function selection, such as the potential occurrence rate, we still cannot avoid 
the subjective color and uncertainty in the process, causing impossibility to 
achieve consistent, rational, objective index. 
 Ideal hypothesis. We do some idealistic process in some assumptions to simplify 
the model and facilitate the assessment. In the case, the influence of probabili
