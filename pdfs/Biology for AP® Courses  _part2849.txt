 the body cells require glucose, glycogen is broken down. (You
can probably hypothesize how your liver will respond if you eat a dozen jelly donuts!) The failure to maintain homeostasis
can be detrimental and can even cause death. Consequently, negative and/or positive feedback loops regulate homeostasis.
Negative feedback mechanisms result in slight fluctuations above and below the set point. For example, if you were to
consume a dozen jelly donuts, your blood sugar level would rise, and your pancreas would release insulin, a hormone
involved in the conversion of glucose to glycogen, thus returning your blood glucose level to its appropriate set point. By
comparison, positive feedback amplifies responses in the same direction, with the variable initiating the response moving
the system even further away from the set point. There are fewer examples of positive feedback, but one is the onset of labor
in childbirth when uterine contractions increase in strength with the secretion of oxyt
