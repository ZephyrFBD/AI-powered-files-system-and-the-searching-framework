 represent the rate of effusion and 
molar mass of the gas, we can write
rx
rO2
= A
ℳO2
ℳx
Solve From the information given,
rx = 0.355 * rO2
Thus,
 rx
rO2
= 0.355 = A
32.0 g>mol
ℳx
 
32.0 g>mol
ℳx
= 10.35522 = 0.126
 
ℳx =
32.0 g>mol
0.126
= 254 g>mol
Because we are told that the unknown gas is composed of homo-
nuclear diatomic molecules, it must be an element. The molar 
mass must represent twice the atomic weight of the atoms in the 
unknown gas. We conclude that the unknown gas must have an 
atomic weight of 127 g>mol and therefore is I2.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
In a system for separating gases, a tank containing a mixture 
of hydrogen and carbon dioxide is connected to a much larger 
tank where the pressure is kept very low. The two tanks are 
separated by a porous membrane through which the molecules 
must effuse. If the initial partial pressure of each gas is  
5.00 atm, what will be the mole fraction of hydrogen in the 
tank after the partial pressure of carbon dioxide has decl
