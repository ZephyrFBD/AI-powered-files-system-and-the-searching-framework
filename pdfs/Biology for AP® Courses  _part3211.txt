 L-glutamate. In fact, monosodium glutamate,
or MSG, is often used in cooking to enhance the savory taste of certain foods. What is the adaptive value of being able to
distinguish umami? Savory substances tend to be high in protein.
All odors that we perceive are molecules in the air we breathe. If a substance does not release molecules into the air from
its surface, it has no smell. And if a human or other animal does not have a receptor that recognizes a specific molecule,
then that molecule has no smell. Humans have about 350 olfactory receptor subtypes that work in various combinations
to allow us to sense about 10,000 different odors. Compare that to mice, for example, which have about 1,300 olfactory
receptor types, and therefore probably sense more odors. Both odors and tastes involve molecules that stimulate specific
chemoreceptors. Although humans commonly distinguish taste as one sense and smell as another, they work together to
create the perception of flavor. A personâ€™s per
