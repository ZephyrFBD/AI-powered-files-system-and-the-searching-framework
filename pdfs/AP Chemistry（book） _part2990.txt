olored molecular models). This overall DNA/protein structure, called  
the nucleosome, is the basic unit of chromosomes in the nuclei of our 
cells. These structures are highly ordered, yet also must be unraveled for 
gene expression to take place. Both packaging and unpackaging of DNA 
in the nucleosome involve changes in the energy of the system.
The amazing organization of  
living systems, from complex molecular 
structures such as those of nucleosomes, to 
cells, to tissues, and finally to whole plants and 
animals, is an unending source of wonder and 
delight to the scientists who study them. Energy 
must be spent, somehow, to form and maintain 
these organized systems. But how is that 
energy channeled to accomplish these tasks? 
We cannot merely take the requisite atoms, put 
them in a pot, add energy, and get something 
like a nucleosome.
Understanding natural processes, whether they be DNA replication, 
photosynthesis, or merely the rusting of a nail, relies on understand-
