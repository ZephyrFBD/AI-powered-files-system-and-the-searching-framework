n than the bacterial protein.
c.
The bacterial protein will be more similar to the yeast protein than the human protein.
d.
The bacterial and yeast proteins will share a similar sequence, but the human protein will be unrelated.

How does controlling gene expression alter the overall protein level in the cell?
16.2 | Prokaryotic Gene Regulation
In this section, you will explore the following question:
•
What are operons and what are the roles of activators, inducers, and repressors in regulating operons and gene
expression?
Connection for AP® Courses
The regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs at the transcriptional level. Simply stated, if a cell does
not transcribe the DNA’s message into mRNA, translation (protein synthesis), does not occur. Bacterial genes are often
organized into common pathways or processes called operons for more coordinated regulation of expression. For example,
in E. coli, genes responsible for lactose metabolism are located toge
