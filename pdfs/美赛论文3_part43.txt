me of bathtub impacts largely on the pervious strategies. If volume
changes a lot, especially heights, to a large extent, our strategies will be affected.
Modification is to increase the speed and the time of adding water appropriately.
5.3 The shape of the person
(1)Even time：
According to the previous two models, people’s size affects little on water
movement because the flow of water is slow. For the same reason, people’s size won’t
influence heat conduction a lot.
Therefor as long as a person doesn’t prevent water from flowing, there is little
effect on water movement and heat conduction caused by people’s size.
(2)Suffering degree:
In the similar way, the process of cooling mainly depends on the surface of water,
while people’s shape doesn’t matter a lot. In other words, people’s shape makes little
difference on the change of water when a person is taking a shower.
Whereas temperature varies from part to part in the bathtub, especially before
water gets a balanced temperature. If
