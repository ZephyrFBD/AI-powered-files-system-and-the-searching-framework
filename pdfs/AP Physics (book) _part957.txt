 is not really appropriate. First of all,
it is only an approximation, and second, it refers only to a limited set of phenomena. Most physicists
today prefer to reserve the word “law” for those relations that are deeper and more encompassing
and precise, such as Newton’s laws of motion or the law of conservation of energy.

‡The fact that E is in the denominator, so 
is the actual proportionality constant, is merely a 
convention. When we rewrite Eq. 9–4 to get Eq. 9–5, E is found in the numerator.

EXERCISE E Two steel wires have the same length and are under the same tension. But
wire A has twice the diameter of wire B. Which of the following is true? (a) Wire B
stretches twice as much as wire A. (b) Wire B stretches four time
