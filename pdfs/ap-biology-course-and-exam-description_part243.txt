impact the validity 
and accuracy of their results. Many questions on the 
AP exam are written in an experimental context, so 
these skills will prove invaluable for both concept 
comprehension and exam performance.
It is important that the AP Biology laboratory program 
be adapted to local conditions and funding even while 
it aims to offer the students a well-rounded experience 
with experimental biology. Adequate lab facilities should 
be provided so that each student has a work space 
where equipment and materials can be left overnight if 
necessary. Sufficient lab glassware for the anticipated 
enrollment and appropriate instruments (balances, and 
pH meters) should be provided.
Students in AP Biology will find it helpful to have access 
to computers with software appropriate for processing 
lab data and writing reports. A lab assistant in the form 
of a paid or unpaid aide may also be helpful; previous 
students may be able to earn credit by serving as 
assistants in the lab.
