 a monosaccharide with a
ketone group (carbonyl group in the middle of the carbon chain) is a
ketose. Glucose and galactose are examples of aldoses, and fructose is an
example of a ketose; all three are hexoses because they each have six
carbons.
Disaccharides are formed when two monosaccharides undergo
dehydration synthesis to form a glycosidic bond. Common disaccharides
include lactose (glucose and galactose), maltose (two glucose
molecules), and sucrose (glucose and fructose).
Polysaccharides are composed of many monosaccharides linked by
glycosidic bonds. In plants, both starch and cellulose are polysaccharides
composed of glucose molecules, but they diﬀer in structure and function.
The diﬀerence is the linkage of the glucose bonds formed during
dehydration synthesis: starch contains alpha linkages and cellulose
contains beta linkages. Starch serves as the main energy storage material
in plants, while cellulose provides structural support. To use energy
stored in starch, organisms
