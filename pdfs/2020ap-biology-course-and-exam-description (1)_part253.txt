Pre-lab work that is acknowledged or checked can 
help determine what gaps students may have prior 
to engagement with the lab. Modeling lab skills and 
procedures is sometimes necessary for students to 
have a successful lab experience. 
At the conclusion of each experiment, students should 
compose a lab report for which they receive feedback, 
identifying gaps in skills or lab procedures. Conducting 
post-lab discussions is an excellent strategy to ensure 
students are mastering lab and inquiry techniques and 
skills. These discussions also help students to connect 
the lab investigation to the enduring understandings.
The lab, as well as pre- and post-lab work should be 
extensions of student learning in the classroom rather 
than discrete activities. Design pre-lab exercises 
and discussions that prepare students for each lab 
experience and then follow up each investigation with 
a post-lab discussion to debrief procedures, errors, 
and conclusions. Test the
