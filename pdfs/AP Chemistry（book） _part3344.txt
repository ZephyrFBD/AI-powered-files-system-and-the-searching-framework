have different mass numbers. The mass number is the total number of nucleons 
in the nucleus.
t Atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers are known as isotopes.
The different isotopes of an element are distinguished by their mass numbers. 
For example, the three naturally occurring isotopes of uranium are uranium-234, 
 
uranium-235, and uranium-238, where the numerical suffixes represent the mass num-
bers. These isotopes are also written 234
92U, 235
92U, and 238
92U, where the superscript is the 
mass number and the subscript is the atomic number.*
Different isotopes of an element have different natural abundances. For example, 
99.3% of naturally occurring uranium is uranium-238, 0.7% is uranium-235, and only 
a trace is uranium-234. Different isotopes of an element also have different stabilities. 
Indeed, the nuclear properties of any given isotope depend on the number of protons 
and neutrons in its nucleus.
