d oxygen (O) are found in all macromolecules.
2. Additionally, nitrogen (N) is found in significant amounts in proteins and nucleic acids.
3. Sulfur (S) is an element commonly found in proteins.
4. Phosphorous (P) is prominent in nucleic acids.
B. There are four classes of biological molecules:
1. Carbohydrates—consist of sugar (monosaccharides) and polymers of sugars (disaccharides and
polysaccharides).
i.
The most important monosaccharide is glucose (C6H12O6).
ii. Sugars are key metabolites used in the synthesis of other organic molecules, as well as the
substrates of glycolysis and the products of photosynthesis.
iii. The particular bonding between carbohydrate subunits is what determines the specific orientation
of the carbohydrate and its secondary structure.
2. Lipids—water-insoluble molecules composed of glycerol and fatty acids.
i.
Fats (triglycerides) are energy storage molecules consisting of one glycerol molecule with three
fatty acid molecules attached.
Saturated fatty acid
