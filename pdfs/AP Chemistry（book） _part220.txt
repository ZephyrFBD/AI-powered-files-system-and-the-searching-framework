 1.11  Consider the jar of jelly beans in the photo. To get an esti-
mate of the number of beans in the jar you weigh six beans 
and obtain masses of 3.15, 3.12, 2.98, 3.14, 3.02, and 3.09 g. 
Then you weigh the jar with all the beans in it, and obtain a 
mass of 2082 g. The empty jar has a mass of 653 g. Based on 
these data, estimate the number of beans in the jar. Justify 
the number of significant figures you use in your estimate.
