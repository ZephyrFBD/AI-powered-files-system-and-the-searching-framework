 If we assume that the voltage declines lin-
early as current is withdrawn, estimate the total maximum 
electrical work the battery could perform during discharge.
 20.106 Disulﬁdes are compounds that have S ¬ S bonds, like per-
oxides have O ¬ O bonds. Thiols are organic compounds 
that have the general formula R ¬ SH, where R is a generic 
hydrocarbon. The SH- ion is the sulfur counterpart of 
hydroxide, OH-. Two thiols can react to make a disulﬁde, 
R ¬ S ¬ S ¬ R. (a) What is the oxidation state of sulfur in 
a thiol? (b) What is the oxidation state of sulfur in a disul-
ﬁde? (c) If you react two thiols to make a disulﬁde, are you 
oxidizing or reducing the thiols? (d) If you wanted to con-
vert a disulﬁde to two thiols, should you add a reducing 
agent or oxidizing agent to the solution? (e) Suggest what 
happens to the H’s in the thiols when they form disulﬁdes.
