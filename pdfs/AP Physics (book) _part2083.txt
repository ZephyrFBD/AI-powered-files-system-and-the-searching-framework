by 20 V, but when it passes from b to c it drops by 12 V. So the net change is
You might think that connecting batteries in reverse like
this would be wasteful. For most purposes that would be true. But such a reverse
arrangement is precisely how a battery charger works. In Fig. 19â€“14b, the 20-V
source is charging up the 12-V battery. Because of its greater voltage, the 
20-V source is forcing charge back into the 12-V battery: electrons are being
forced into its negative terminal and removed from its positive terminal.
An automobile alternator keeps the car battery charged in the same way.
A voltmeter placed across the terminals of a (12-V) car battery with the engine
running fairly fast can tell you whether or not the alternator is charging the
battery. If it is, the voltmeter reads 13 or 14 V. If the battery is not being charged,
the voltage will be 12 V, or less if the battery is discharging. Car batteries can be
recharged, but other batteries may not be rechargeable because the c
