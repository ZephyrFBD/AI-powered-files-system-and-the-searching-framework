Both dmpe and en are bidentate ligands, binding through P and 
N, respectively. Because phosphorus is less electronegative than N, 
dmpe is a stronger electron pair donor and Lewis base than en. Dmpe 
creates a stronger ligand ﬁeld and is higher on the spectrochemical 
series. Structurally, dmpe occupies a larger volume than en. M–P 
bonds are longer than M—N bonds and the two ¬ CH3 groups on 
each P atom in dmpe create more steric hindrance than the H atoms 
on N in en. (b) The oxidation state of Mo is zero. (c) The symbol P P 
represents the bidentate dmpe ligand.
