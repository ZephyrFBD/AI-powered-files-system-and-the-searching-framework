r AP Biology. However, hormonal control of the menstrual cycle
includes negative and positive feedback mechanisms, which are
important topics and may be included on the AP exam.
After fertilization, the zygote undergoes a rapid mitotic cell division
called cleavage, which results in the formation of a hollow ball of
tiny cells called a blastocyst, the mammalian version of a blastula.
The cells of the blastocyst are pluripotent or omnipotent, meaning
that they retain the ability to differentiate into any cell type. As
embryonic development continues, specific genes turn off
sequentially, causing the differentiation of omnipotent cells into
specialized cells. As mitotic cell division continues, the process of
gastrulation leads to the development of three embryonic layers:
ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. They will each develop into
separate body structures: nerves and skin, blood and bones, and
digestive organs, respectively.
Programmed cell death (apoptosis) plays an important role in
