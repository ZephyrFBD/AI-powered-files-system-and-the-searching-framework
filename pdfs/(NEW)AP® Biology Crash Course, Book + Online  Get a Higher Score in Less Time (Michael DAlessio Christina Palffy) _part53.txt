ATP.
B. Lactic acid fermentation includes glycolysis plus an additional reaction that generates NAD+ and lactic
acid.
1. Certain fungi, bacteria, and muscle cells have special enzymes that carry out lactic acid fermentation.
2. In vigorously exercising muscle cells, lactic acid fermentation provides ATP when the circulatory
system cannot keep up with the oxygen demands of the muscle cells.
C. Alcohol fermentation includes glycolysis plus additional reactions that produce NAD+, ethanol, and CO2.
1. Single-celled organisms, such as yeast and some plant cells, have special enzymes to carry out alcohol
fermentation.
2. Yeast is used in bread making because CO2 gas causes bread to rise; the ethanol is removed by
subsequent baking. Yeast is also used in beer making because it produces ethanol; CO2 in an enclosed
container produces carbonation.
There is usually at least one APÂ® Biology exam question that requires comparing photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Also,
keep in mind that plant
