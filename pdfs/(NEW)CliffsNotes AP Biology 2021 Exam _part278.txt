mosome to properly
move to opposite poles during meiosis or mitosis. Some examples of nondisjunction follow:
1. During meiosis, the failure for two homologous chromosomes (during anaphase I) or two chromatids of a single
chromosome (during anaphase II) to separate produces gametes with extra or missing chromosomes.
2. During mitosis, the failure of two chromatids of a single chromosome (during anaphase) to separate produces
daughter cells with extra or missing chromosomes. This happens most often during embryonic development and
results in mosaicism, in which a fraction of the body cells, those descendent of a cell where nondisjunction occurs,
have an extra or missing chromosome.
3. Polyploidy occurs if all of the chromosomes undergo meiotic nondisjunction and produce gametes with twice the
number of chromosomes. If a polyploid gamete is fertilized with a similar gamete, then a polyploidy zygote and
individual can form. Polyploidy is common in plants.
