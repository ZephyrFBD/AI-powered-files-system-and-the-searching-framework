ta G (∆G). The change in free energy can be calculated
for any system that undergoes such a change, such as a chemical reaction. To calculate ∆G, subtract the amount of energy
lost to entropy (denoted as ∆S) from the total energy change of the system. This total energy change in the system is called
enthalpy and is denoted as ∆H . The formula for calculating ∆G is as follows, where the symbol T refers to absolute
temperature in Kelvin (degrees Celsius + 273):
ΔG = ΔH −TΔS
The standard free energy change of a chemical reaction is expressed as an amount of energy per mole of the reaction product
(either in kilojoules or kilocalories, kJ/mol or kcal/mol; 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal) under standard pH, temperature, and pressure
conditions. Standard pH, temperature, and pressure conditions are generally calculated at pH 7.0 in biological systems,
25 degrees Celsius, and 100 kilopascals (1 atm pressure), respectively. It is important to note that cellular conditions vary
considerably from these standa
