Problem 43.
38. (II) A power line carries a current of 95 A west along the
tops of 8.5-m-high poles. (a) What is the magnitude and
direction of the magnetic field produced by this wire at 
the ground directly below? How does this compare with the
Earth’s magnetic field of about
(b) Where would the
wire’s magnetic field cancel the Earth’s field?
39. (II) A compass needle points 17° E of N outdoors. However,
when it is placed 12.0 cm to the east of a vertical wire inside
a building, it points 32° E of N. What is the magnitude and
direction of the current in the wire? The Earth’s field there
is 
and is horizontal.

20–7 Solenoids and Electromagnets
44. (I) A thin 12-cm-long solenoid has a total of 460 turns of
wire and carries a current of 2.0 A. Calculate the field inside
the solenoid near the center.
45. (I) A 30.0-cm-long solenoid 1.25 cm in diameter is to
produce a field of 4.65 mT at its center. How much current
should the solenoid carry if it has 935 turns
