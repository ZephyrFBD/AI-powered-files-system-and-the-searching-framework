 battery is an example of a primary 
cell battery. Lead–acid, nickel–cadmium, nickel–metal hydride, 
and lithium-ion batteries are examples of secondary cells. Fuel 
cells are voltaic cells that utilize redox reactions in which reactants 
such as H2 have to be continuously supplied to the cell to generate 
voltage.
CORROSION (SECTION 20.8) Electrochemical principles help us 
understand corrosion, undesirable redox reactions in which a metal 
is attacked by some substance in its environment. The corrosion of 
iron into rust is caused by the presence of water and oxygen, and it 
is accelerated by the presence of electrolytes, such as road salt. The 
protection of a metal by putting it in contact with another metal that 
more readily undergoes oxidation is called cathodic protection. Galva-
nized iron, for example, is coated with a thin layer of zinc; because 
zinc is oxidized more readily than iron, the zinc serves as a sacrificial 
anode in the redox reaction.
