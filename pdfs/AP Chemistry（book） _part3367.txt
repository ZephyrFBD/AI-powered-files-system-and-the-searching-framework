Accelerating Charged 
Particles
Alpha particles and other positively 
charged particles must move very 
fast to overcome the electrostatic 
repulsion between them and the tar-
get nucleus. The higher the nuclear 
charge on either the bombarding par-
ticle or the target nucleus, the faster 
the bombarding particle must move 
to bring about a nuclear reaction. 
Many methods have been devised to 
accelerate charged particles, using 
strong magnetic and electrostatic 
fields. These particle accelera-
tors, popularly called “atom smash-
ers,” bear such names as cyclotron and 
synchrotron.
A common theme of all parti-
cle accelerators is the need to create 
charged particles so that they can be 
manipulated by electric and magnetic 
fields. In addition, the region through 
which the particles move must be kept 
at high vacuum so that they do not col-
lide with any gas-phase molecules.

linear accelerator. A charged particle, 
such as
