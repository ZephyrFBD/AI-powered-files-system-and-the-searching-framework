 basic acetylide 
ion 1C2
2 -2, which reacts with water to form acetylene.
The other group 4A elements show great diversity in physical 
and chemical properties. Silicon, the second most abundant ele-
ment, is a semiconductor. It reacts with Cl2 to form SiCl4, a liquid at 
room temperature, a reaction that is used to help purify silicon from 
its native minerals. Silicon forms strong Si¬O bonds and therefore 
occurs in a variety of silicate minerals. Silica is SiO2; silicates consist 
of SiO4 tetrahedra, linked together at their vertices to form chains, 
sheets, or three-dimensional structures. The most common three- 
dimensional silicate is quartz 1SiO22. Glass is an amorphous (non-
crystalline) form of SiO2. Silicones contain O¬ Si¬O chains with 
organic groups bonded to the Si atoms. Like silicon, germanium is a 
metalloid; tin and lead are metallic.
