 how prokaryotes exchange genetic material by HGT, it was initially thought that this process
was absent in eukaryotes. After all, prokaryotes are but single cells exposed directly to their environment, whereas the
sex cells of multicellular organisms are usually sequestered in protected parts of the body. It follows from this idea that
the gene transfers between multicellular eukaryotes should be more difficult. Indeed, it is thought that this process is
rarer in eukaryotes and has a much smaller evolutionary impact than in prokaryotes. In spite of this fact, HGT between
distantly related organisms has been demonstrated in several eukaryotic species, and it is possible that more examples will
be discovered in the future.
In plants, gene transfer has been observed in species that cannot cross-pollinate by normal means. Transposons or “jumping
genes” have been shown to transfer between rice and millet plant species. Furthermore, fungal species feeding on yew trees,
from which the anti-c
