obacco plant is crossed with
an albino (gg) tobacco plant, and 100 offspring are produced. Fifty offspring are expected to be green (Gg), and
50 offspring are expected to be albino (gg). However, when the offspring are counted, 60 green plants and 40
albino plants are observed.
(a) Identify the degrees of freedom in this experiment.
(b) Calculate the chi-square value for this data.
(c) Make a claim about whether or not the observed data are likely significantly different statistically from the
expected data. Use a p-value of 0.05.
(d) Justify your claim from part (c) with your knowledge of the chi-square test.

13. Organic gardeners will sometimes use ladybugs as a method of reducing aphid populations in their gardens. A
garden infested with aphids is divided into three sections. In the first section, no treatment (to reduce the aphid

third section, a chemic
