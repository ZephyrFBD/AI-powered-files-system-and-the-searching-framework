LEARNING OBJECTIVE
SYI-3.D
Explain how the genetic 
diversity of a species or 
population affects its ability 
to withstand environmental 
pressures. 
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SYI-3.D.1
The level of variation in a population affects 
population dynamics—
a.	 Population ability to respond to changes in the 
environment is influenced by genetic diversity. 
Species and populations with little genetic 
diversity are at risk of decline or extinction. 
b. Genetically diverse populations are more 
resilient to environmental perturbation 
because they are more likely to contain 
individuals
