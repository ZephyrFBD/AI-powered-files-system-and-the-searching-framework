f information and a vital
part of this decoding process and the body’s connection to other
realities. Change DNA and you change the way we decode and
connect with reality – see ‘Covid vaccines’. Think of computers
decoding Wi-Fi. You have information encoded in a radiation ﬁeld
and the computer decodes that information into a very diﬀerent
form on the screen. You can’t see the Wi-Fi until its information is
made manifest on the screen and the information on the screen is
inside the computer and not outside. I have just described how we
decode the ‘human world’. All ﬁve senses decode the waveform ‘Wi-
Fi’ ﬁeld into electrical signals and the brain (computer) constructs
reality inside the brain and not outside – ‘You don’t just look at a
rainbow, you create it’. Sound is a simple example. We don’t hear
sound until the brain decodes it. Waveform sound waves are picked
up by the hearing sense and communicated to the brain in an
electrical form to be decoded into the sounds that we hear.
