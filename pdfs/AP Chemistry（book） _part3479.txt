. (b) How does this mass loss arise? (c) It is esti-
mated that the Sun contains 9 * 1056 free protons. How 
many protons per second are consumed in nuclear reac-
tions in the Sun?
 21.85  The average energy released in the fission of a single 
uranium-235 nucleus is about 3 * 10-11 J. If the conver-
sion of this energy to electricity in a nuclear power plant is 
40% efficient, what mass of uranium-235 undergoes fission 
in a year in a plant that produces 1000 megawatts? Recall 
that a watt is 1 J/s.
 21.86  Tests on human subjects in Boston in 1965 and 1966, fol-
lowing the era of atomic bomb testing, revealed average 
quantities of about 2 pCi of plutonium radioactivity in the 
average person. How many disintegrations per second does 
this level of activity imply? If each alpha particle deposits 
8 * 10-13 J of energy and if the average person weighs 75 
kg, calculate the number of rads and rems of radiation in 1 
yr from such a level of plutonium.
