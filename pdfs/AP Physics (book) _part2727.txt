water waves, where each point vibrates up and down.
2. Why is light sometimes described as rays and sometimes as
waves?
3. We can hear sounds around corners but we cannot see
around corners; yet both sound and light are waves.
Explain the difference.
4. Two rays of light from the same source destructively interfere
if their path lengths differ by how much?
5. Monochromatic red light is incident on a double slit, and
the interference pattern is viewed on a screen some distance
away. Explain how the fringe pattern would change if the
red light source is replaced by a blue light source.
6. If Young’s double-slit experiment were submerged in water,
how would the fringe pattern be changed?

The Wave Nature of Light
7. Why doesn’t the light from the two headlights of a distant
car produce an interference pattern?
8. Why are interference fringes noticeable only for a thin film
like a soap bubble and not for a thick piece of glass?
9. Why are the fringes of Newton’s rin
