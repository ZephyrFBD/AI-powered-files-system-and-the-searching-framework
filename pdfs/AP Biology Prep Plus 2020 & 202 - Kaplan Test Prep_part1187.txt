on with higher water potential is a hypotonic solution, so water moves into the cell.
5. Scoring Guidelines for Free-Response Question 5
(a) Describe the three stages of speciation shown in the figure. (1 point)
Description (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Speciation is the formation of new and distinct species via divergent
evolution. The initial stage is separation, the second stage is evolution (e.g.,
adaptation to new environments), and the third stage is  reproductive isolation
resulting in a new species.
(b) Explain the diﬀerence between allopatric and sympatric speciation. (1
point)
Explanation (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
In allopatric speciation, geographic isolation occurs. The original population
separates and evolves into distinct populations since the geographic barrier
prevents genetic interchange. In sympatric speciation, polymorphism
(individuals within a population acquire distinctively diffe
