from the interplay of mechanoreceptors.
Density of Mechanoreceptors
The distribution of touch receptors in human skin is not consistent over the body. In humans, touch receptors are less dense
in skin covered with any type of hair, such as the arms, legs, torso, and face. Touch receptors are denser in glabrous skin

(the type found on human fingertips and lips, for example), which is typically more sensitive and is thicker than hairy skin
(4 to 5 mm versus 2 to 3 mm).
How is receptor density estimated in a human subject? The relative density of pressure receptors in different locations on
the body can be demonstrated experimentally using a two-point discrimination test. In this demonstration, two sharp points,
such as two thumbtacks, are brought into contact with the subjectâ€™s skin (though not hard enough to cause pain or break the
skin). The subject reports if he or she feels one point or two points. If the
