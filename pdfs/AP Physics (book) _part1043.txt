f a stream. When you lift 
the rock through the surface of the water, it suddenly seems to be much heavier.
Many objects, such as wood, float on the surface of water. These are two exam-
ples of buoyancy. In each example, the force of gravity is acting downward. But
in addition, an upward buoyant force is exerted by the liquid. The buoyant 
force on fish and underwater divers almost exactly balances the force of gravity
downward, and allows them to “hover” in equilibrium.
The buoyant force occurs because the pressure in a fluid increases with depth.
Thus the upward pressure on the bottom surface of a submerged object is greater
than the downward pressure on its top surface. To see this effect, consider a
cylinder of height 
whose top and bottom ends have an area A and which is
completely submerged in a fluid of density 
as shown in Fig. 10–10. The 
fluid exerts a pressure
at the top surface of the cylinder (Eq. 10–3a).
