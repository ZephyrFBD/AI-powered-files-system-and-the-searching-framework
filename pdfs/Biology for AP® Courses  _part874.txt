arries the electrons to a
later pathway for ATP production. At this point, the glucose molecule that originally entered cellular respiration has been
completely oxidized. Chemical potential energy stored within the glucose molecule has been transferred to electron
carriers or has been used to synthesize a few ATPs.
The citric acid cycle is a series of redox and decarboxylation reactions that remove high-energy electrons and carbon
dioxide. The electrons temporarily stored in molecules of NADH and FADH2 are used to generate ATP in a subsequent
pathway. One molecule of either GTP or ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation on each turn of the cycle.
There is no comparison of the cyclic pathway with a linear one.
7.4 Oxidative Phosphorylation
The electron transport chain is the portion of aerobic respiration that uses free oxygen as the final electron acceptor of the
electrons removed from the intermediate compounds in glucose catabolism. The electron transport chain is composed
