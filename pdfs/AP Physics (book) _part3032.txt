Electron Diffraction
From Example 27–11, we see that electrons can have wavelengths on the order
of 
and even smaller. Although small, this wavelength can be detected:
the spacing of atoms in a crystal is on the order of 
and the orderly array
of atoms in a crystal could be used as a type of diffraction grating, as was done
earlier for X-rays (see Section 25–11). C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer per-
formed the crucial experiment: they scattered electrons from the surface of a metal
crystal and, in early 1927, observed that the electrons were scattered into a pattern
of regular peaks. When they interpreted these peaks as a diffraction pattern, the
wavelength of the diffracted electron wave was found to be just that predicted by
de Broglie, Eq. 27–8. In the same year, G. P
. Thomson (son of J. J. Thomson) used
a different experimental arrangement and also detected diffraction of electrons.
