6 O atoms. Because there 
are equal numbers of N and O atoms in the two boxes, the 
drawing is consistent with the law of conservation of mass.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
In the following diagram, the white spheres represent hydrogen 
atoms and the blue spheres represent nitrogen atoms.
?
The two reactants combine to form a single product, ammo-
nia, NH3, which is not shown. Write a balanced chemical 
equation for the reaction. Based on the equation and the 
contents of the left (reactants) box, how many NH3 mole-
cules should be shown in the right (products) box?  
(a) 2 (b) 3 (c) 4 (d) 6 (e) 9
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
In the following diagram, the white spheres represent hy-
drogen atoms, the black spheres carbon atoms, and the red 
spheres oxygen atoms.
