In general, for the functions y = a sin x and y = a cos x, the number |a| is called the 
amplitude and is the largest value these functions attain. 
 
 
Example 2 
Find the amplitude of y = −3 cos x and sketch its graph. 
 
 
 
 
 
Since the sine and cosine functions have period 2π, the functions y = a sin kx and y = a 
cos kx complete one period as kx varies from 0 to 2π, that is, for

So these functions complete one period as x varies between 0 and 2π/k, and thus have 
period 2π/k. 
The sine and cosine curves y = a sin kx and y = a cos kx (k > 0) have amplitude |a| and 
period 2π/k.

We see that the effect is to shrink the graph horizontally if k > 1 or to stretch the graph 
horizontally if k < 1. 
For comparison, we show the graphs of one period of the sine curve y = a sin kx for 
several values of k. 
 
 
Example 3 
Find the amplitude and period of each function, and sketch its graph.
