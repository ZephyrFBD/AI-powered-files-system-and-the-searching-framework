Suffering degree:
Due to the influence of the bubble, the temperature of the water will not be so
easy to get lost, which indirectly results in the time of being uncomfortable
increasing so that the suffering degree increases.
(3)Wasting water:
The time during the process of fusion and cleaning increases, so the times of
adding water decreases. That is to say, wasting water decreases.
(4)Conclusion:
Bubbles will have some impacts on our strategies before to some extent.
Modification is to increase the speed of adding water and stir the water
continuously during the process of adding water to enable the water to be even much
more quickly.
6. Improvement of model
Actually, our cooling model is still rough and ideal so that there is a lot of space
to improve our cooling model. This time, we are trying to improve our cooling model
from a new perspective. Using Weber-Fechner law to solve the problem of water
being cool in a natural condition will have some errors, so we specifically analyze
