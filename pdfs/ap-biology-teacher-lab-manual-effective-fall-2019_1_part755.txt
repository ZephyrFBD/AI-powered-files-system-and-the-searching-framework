of Behavior. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1999. 
This book is a classic read about the behavior of fruit flies as investigated by Seymour 
Benzer, one of the great biologists of the 20th century. This text is a very good 
summary of research completed in classical experiments in physiology and behavior. 
It sets the stage for a teacher interested in working with fruit flies. It would be an 
excellent book for students to read after completing the experiments because of the 
engaging connections made between Drosophila and the researchers.
