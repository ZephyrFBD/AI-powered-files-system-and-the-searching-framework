all
molecules, including signaling molecules, to flow between neighboring cells. Cell communication can also happen over
long distances using. For example, hormones released from endocrine cells travel to target cells in multiple body systems.
How does a ligand such as a hormone traveling through the bloodstream “know” when it has reached its target organ
to initiate a cellular response? Nearly all cell signaling pathways involve three stages: reception, signal transduction, and
cellular response.
Cell signaling pathways begin when the ligand binds to a receptor, a protein that is embedded in the plasma membrane of the
target cell or found in the cell cytoplasm. The receptors are very specific, and each ligand is recognized by a different one.
This stage of the pathway is called reception. Molecules that are nonpolar, such as steroids, diffuse across the cell membrane
and bind to internal receptors. In turn, the receptor-ligand complex moves to the nucleus and interacts with cellular D
