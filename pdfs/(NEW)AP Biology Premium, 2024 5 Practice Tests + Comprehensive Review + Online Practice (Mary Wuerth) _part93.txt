The two strands in the double helix of DNA are antiparallel; the 5′ phosphate group of one of the strands in the
double helix is at the opposite end from the 5′ phosphate group of the other strand, as shown in Figure 4.8.
Figure 4.8 Antiparallel Structure of DNA
Thymine, uracil, and cytosine are all in a class of macromolecules called pyrimidines. Adenine and guanine are
purines. When DNA strands form, a purine complements a pyrimidine and forms a series of hydrogen bonds,
making the “rungs” of the ladder in the double helix. Thymine and adenine form two hydrogen bonds with one
another, whereas guanine and cytosine form three hydrogen bonds with each other. Chapter 15 will discuss the
profound implications this has for how DNA is replicated.
