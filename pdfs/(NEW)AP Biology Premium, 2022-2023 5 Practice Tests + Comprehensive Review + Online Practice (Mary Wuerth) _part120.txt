ad” and two hydrophobic (or nonpolar) “tails.” When the bilayer of
phospholipids is formed in an aqueous environment, the hydrophobic lipid tails orient themselves away from the
water toward the interior of the membrane, while the hydrophilic phosphate heads are oriented facing the aqueous
environment on the exterior of the membrane, as shown in Figure 5.12.
Figure 5.12 Phospholipid
Embedded in this phospholipid bilayer are membrane proteins, modified proteins called glycoproteins, modified
lipids called glycolipids, and steroids. These components of the membrane are mobile and can flow throughout the
surface of the plasma membrane, allowing the cell to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Proteins in the
plasma membrane have many functions, including transporting materials, participating in cell signaling processes,
anchoring the cell to its surroundings, and catalyzing chemical reactions. Glycoproteins and glycolipids function in
cell recognition. Steroids in the plasma membra
