sine are
pyrimidines. The nitrogenous bases of opposite chains are paired to one
another by hydrogen bonds: the adenine nucleotide bonds by a double
hydrogen bond to the thymine nucleotide, and the cytosine nucleotide
bonds by a triple hydrogen bond to the guanine nucleotide; see Figure
9.3.
REMEMBER
The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions.
IST-1
Both DNA and RNA exhibit base pairing rules that are conserved (unchanged)
through evolutionary history.
DNA gets packed and unpacked in the nucleus as needed. Eukaryotic
DNA combines with a large amount of proteins called histones from
which it separates only briefly during replication. This complex of DNA
plus histones is called by the general name chromatin. The double helix
of DNA wraps twice around a core of histones, forming structures called
nucleosomes that look like beads on a string, as depicted later in this
chapter in Figure 9.14.
