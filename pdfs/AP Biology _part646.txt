oxygen atom with the same ease; there is no cooperativity.
Graph D: Here is a dissociation curve for mammals evolved at sea
level and mammals evolved at very high altitudes. Since less
oxygen is available at high altitudes, mammals that evolved there
must have hemoglobin with a greater affinity for oxygen.

Being able to interpret graphs is important.

Transport of Carbon Dioxide
Very little carbon dioxide is transported by hemoglobin. Most carbon
dioxide is carried in the plasma as part of the reversible blood buffering
carbonic acid–bicarbonate ion system, which maintains the blood at a
constant pH of 7.4. The bicarbonate ion is produced in a two-stage
reaction. First, carbon dioxide combines with wa
