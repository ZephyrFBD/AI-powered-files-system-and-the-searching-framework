 12.76  Cadmium telluride is an important material for solar cells. 
(a) What is the band gap of CdTe? (b) What wavelength of 
light would a photon of this energy correspond to? (c) Draw 
a vertical line at this wavelength in the figure shown in Exer-
cise 12.75, which shows the light output of the sun as a func-
tion of wavelength. (d) With respect to silicon, does CdTe 
absorb a larger or smaller portion of the solar spectrum?

 12.77  The semiconductor CdSe has a band gap of 1.74 eV. What 
wavelength of light would be emitted from an LED made 
from CdSe? What region of the electromagnetic spectrum is 
this?
 12.78  The first LEDs were made from GaAs, which has a band 
gap of 1.43 eV. What wavelength of light would be emit-
ted from an LED made from GaAs? What region of the 
electromagnetic spectrum does this light
