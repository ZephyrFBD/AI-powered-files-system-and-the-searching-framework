Figure 37.4 These are the trophic levels of a food chain in Lake Ontario at the United States-Canada border. Energy
and nutrients flow from photosynthetic green algae at the bottom to the top of the food chain: the Chinook salmon.
One major factor that limits the length of food chains is energy. Energy is lost as heat between each trophic level due to the
second law of thermodynamics. Thus, after a limited number of trophic energy transfers, the amount of energy remaining
in the food chain may not be great enough to support viable populations at yet a higher trophic level.
The loss of energy between trophic levels is illustrated by the pioneering studies of Howard T. Odum in the Silver Springs,
Florida, ecosystem in the 1940s (Figure 37.5). The primary producers generated 20,819 kcal/m2/yr (kilocalories per square
meter per year), the primary consu
