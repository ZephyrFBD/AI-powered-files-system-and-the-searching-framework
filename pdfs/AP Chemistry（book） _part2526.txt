▲ Figure 16.4 Relative strengths of select conjugate acid–base pairs. The two members of each  
pair are listed opposite each other in the two columns.
Give It Some Thought
Given that HClO4 is a strong acid, how would you classify the basicity of ClO4

16.3 ∣ The Autoionization of Water
One of the most important chemical properties of water is its ability to act as either a 
Brønsted–Lowry acid or a Brønsted–Lowry base. In the presence of an acid, it acts as a 
proton acceptor; in the presence of a base, it acts as a proton donor. In fact, one water 
molecule can donate a proton to another water molecule:
 
[16.12]
We call this process the autoionization of water.
Because the forward and reverse reactions in Equation 16.12 are extremely rapid, 
no water molecule remains ionized for long. At room temperature only about two out 
of every 109 water molecules are ionized at any given instant. T
