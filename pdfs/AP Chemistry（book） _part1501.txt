CHAPTER 9 Molecular Geometry and Bonding Theories
 9.18  Would you expect the nonbonding electron-pair domain in 
NH3 to be greater or less in size than the corresponding one 
in PH3?
 9.19 In which of these molecules or ions does the presence of 
nonbonding electron pairs produce an effect on molecular 
shape? (a) SiH4, (b) PF3, (c) HBr, (d) HCN, (e) SO2.
 9.20 In which of the following molecules can you confidently 
predict the bond angles about the central atom, and for 
which would you be a bit uncertain? Explain in each case. 
 
(a) H2S, (b) BCl3, (c) CH3I, (d) CBr4, (e) TeBr4.
