nd the chloroplasts will condense into a small circle. If you wash away
the salt water solution and rehydrate the cells with distilled water, you will
see the cell fill up with water (turgor) and appear similar to the way it was
initially. However, the cell is no longer alive; see Figure 19.11.

LAB #5: PHOTOSYNTHESIS
Introduction
The process of photosynthesis provides oxygen for Earth’s atmosphere.
Like all enzyme-driven reactions, the rate of photosynthesis can be
measured by either the disappearance of substrate or by the accumulation
of products or by-products. The photosynthesis equation can be
summarized as:
6CO2+12H2O→C6H12lightO6+6H2O + 6O2
Objective
Determine the rate of photosynthesis in living plant tissue using the
floating leaf disk technique.
In this lab, you will determine the rate of photosynthesis by measuring
the accumulation of oxygen by counting the number of disks that rise. You
