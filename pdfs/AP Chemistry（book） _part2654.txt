 in the blood of people with phenylketon-
uria, an inherited disorder that can cause mental retarda-
tion or even death. A 0.085 M solution of C6H5CH2COOH 
has a pH of 2.68. Calculate the Ka value for this acid.
 16.53  A 0.100 M solution of chloroacetic acid 1ClCH2COOH2 
is 11.0% ionized. Using this information, calculate 
3ClCH2COO-4, 3H+4, 3ClCH2COOH4, and Ka for chloroace-
tic acid.
 16.54  A 0.100 M solution of bromoacetic acid 1BrCH2COOH2 is 
 
13.2% ionized. Calculate 3H+4, 3BrCH2COO-4, 3BrCH2COOH4 
and Ka for bromoacetic acid.
 16.55  A particular sample of vinegar has a pH of 2.90. If acetic acid 
is the only acid that vinegar contains 1Ka = 1.8 * 10-52, 
calculate the concentration of acetic acid in the vinegar.
 16.56  If a solution of HF 1Ka = 6.8 * 10-42 has a pH of 3.65, cal-
culate the concentration of hydrofluoric acid.
 16.57  The acid-dissociation constant for benzoic acid 1C6H5COOH2 
is 6.3 * 10-5. Calculate the equilibrium concentrations of 
H3O+, C6H5COO-, and C6H5
