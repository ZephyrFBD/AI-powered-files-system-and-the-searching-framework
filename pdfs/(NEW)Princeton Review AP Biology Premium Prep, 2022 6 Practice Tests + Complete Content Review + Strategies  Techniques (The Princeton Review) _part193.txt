 the cytoskeleton. The most important fibers you’ll need to know
are microtubules and microfilaments.
Microtubules, which are made up of the protein tubulin, participate in cellular division and movement. These small
fibers are an integral part of three structures: centrioles, cilia, and flagella. We’ve already mentioned that centrioles
help chromosomes separate during cell division.
Microfilaments, like microtubules, are important for movement. These thin, rod-like structures are composed of the
protein actin. Actin monomers are joined together and broken apart as needed to allow microfilaments to grow and
shrink. Microfilaments assist during cytokinesis, muscle contraction, and formation of pseudopodia extensions
during cell movement.
Cilia and Flagella
Cilia and flagella are threadlike structures best known for their locomotive properties in single-celled organisms.
The beating motion of cilia and flagella structures propels these organisms through their watery environments.
The two
