84. The frequency of a steam train whistle as it approaches you
is 565 Hz. After it passes you, its frequency is measured as
486 Hz. How fast was the train moving (assume constant
velocity)?
85. Two trains emit 508-Hz whistles. One train is stationary.
The conductor on the stationary train hears a 3.5-Hz beat
frequency when the other train approaches. What is the
speed of the moving train?
86. Two loudspeakers are at opposite ends of a railroad car as
it moves past a stationary observer at 
as shown in
Fig. 12–41. If the speakers have identical sound frequen-
cies of 348 Hz, what is the beat frequency heard by the
observer when (a) he listens from position A, in front of
the car, (b) he is between the speakers, at B, and (c) he
hears the speakers after they have passed him, at C?
