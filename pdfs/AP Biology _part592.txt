pool?
The genetic trait of altruism arises frequently as a mutation
because the colony must be protected.
The worker honeybee that dies shares most of her genes with
her sister worker honeybees. When she dies, others that share
most of the same genes will get to pass the altruistic trait on to

Only some worker honeybees carry the altruism trait. They

Among hens, the alpha (top-ranked) male controls the behavior of
