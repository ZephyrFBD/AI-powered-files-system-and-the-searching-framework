 such as ammonia or carbon dioxide are 
generally considered “inorganic.”
The study of the chemistry of living species is called biological chemistry, chemical bi-
ology, or biochemistry. In this chapter, we present some of the elementary aspects of 
both organic chemistry and biochemistry.

General Characteristics  
of Organic Molecules
What is it about carbon that leads to the tremendous diversity in its compounds and 
allows it to play such crucial roles in biology and society? Let’s consider some general fea-
tures of organic molecules and, as we do, review principles we learned in earlier chapters.
the structures of Organic Molecules
Because carbon has four valence electrons (3He42s22p2), it forms four bonds in virtually 
all its compounds. When all four bonds are single bonds, the electron pairs are disposed 
in a tetrahedral arrangement. 
 (Section 9.2) In the hybridization model, the carbon 
2s and 2p orbitals are then sp3 hybridized. 
 (Section 9.5) When there is one d
