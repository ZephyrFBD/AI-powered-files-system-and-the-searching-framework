ar bodies, but they
ultimately undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death). Concentrating the cytoplasm in one viable secondary oocyte
(and at the end of meiosis II, one egg) assures that adequate amounts of stored food, as well as mitochondria,
ribosomes, and other cytoplasmic organelles, will be available for the developing embryo. In contrast, the sperm
contributes very little cytoplasm at fertilization.
Ovulation marks the release of the secondary oocyte from the follicle. If it is fertilized by a sperm as it moves
through the oviduct, the secondary oocyte will complete meiosis II and produce an egg that combines with the
chromosomes contributed by the sperm. The second daughter cell of meiosis II, again a polar body, undergoes
apoptosis.
Spermatogenesis begins at puberty within the seminiferous tubules of the testes. Cells called spermatogonia divide
by mitosis repeatedly to produce primary spermatocytes that begin meiosis. Meiosis I produces two secondary
spermatocytes, which, at t
