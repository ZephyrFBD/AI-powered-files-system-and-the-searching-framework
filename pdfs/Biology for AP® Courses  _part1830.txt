28. The lac operon consists of regulatory regions such as
the promoter as well as the structural genes lacZ, lacY, and
lacA, which code for proteins involved in lactose
metabolism. What would be the outcome of a mutation in
one of the structural genes of the lac operon?
a.
Mutation in structural genes will stop
transcription.
b.
Mutated lacY will produce an abnormal Î²
galactosidase protein.
c.
Mutated l
