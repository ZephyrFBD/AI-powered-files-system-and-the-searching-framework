erefore the rate of the reaction.
(A)
At 30°C, the substrate molecules have more kinetic energy
than at 37°C. The excess kinetic energy makes it harder for
the substrate to bind to the enzyme.
(B)
At 37°C, the enzymes have formed the correct shape to
maximize the reaction rate. At 30°C, the enzymes have
denatured due to excess heat and the substrates have more
diﬀiculty binding to the active site.
(C)
At 37°C, the concentration of the substrates is higher than at
30°C. This allows the reaction to proceed more rapidly.
(D)

7. Lactase catalyzes the breakdown of lactose into monosaccharides
(galactose and glucose). Students performed an experiment to
study the eﬀects of lactose concentration and pH on the reaction.
