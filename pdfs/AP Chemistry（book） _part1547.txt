The gases in our atmosphere, primarily N2 and O2  
molecules, are heated by the Sun and moved here 
and there by pressure differences that create wind.
It is the behavior of gases that creates our weather—the gentle breezes, 
the violent storms, the humidity, and the rain. Tornadoes, like the 
one shown in the chapter-opening photo, form when moist, warm air 
at lower elevations converges with cooler, dry air above. The resultant 
air flows produce winds that can approach speeds up to 500 km/hr 
 
(300 mph).
In this chapter, we examine the physical properties of gases—what 
is atmospheric pressure, how do gases respond to changes in pressure 
and temperature, and what does temperature measure at the molec-
ular level? Because gases are the simplest state of matter, they serve as 
an excellent starting point for probing the behavior of large collections 
of atoms or molecules. Indeed, it is fairly straightforward to formulate a 
simple model for gases that expla
