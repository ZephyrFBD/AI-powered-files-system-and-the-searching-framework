librium concentrations, and so the 
reaction will proceed to the right (toward products) to achieve equilibrium. If Q 7 K, 
product concentrations are too high and reactant concentrations are too low, and so 
the reaction will proceed to the left to achieve equilibrium. If Q = K, the reaction is at 
equilibrium.
For solubility-product equilibria, the relationship between Q and Ksp is exactly like 
that for other equilibria. For Ksp reactions, products are always the soluble ions, and the 
reactant is always the solid.
Therefore, for solubility equilibria,
t
If Q = Ksp, the system is at equilibrium, which means the solution is saturated; 
this is the highest concentration the solution can have without precipitating.
t If Q 6 Ksp, the reaction will proceed to the right, toward the soluble ions; no 
precipitate will form.
t If Q 7 Ksp, the reaction will proceed to the left, toward the solid; precipitate will 
form.
For the case of the barium sulfate solution, then we would calculate Q
