13–13 Diffusion
If you carefully place a few drops of food coloring in a glass of water as in 
Fig. 13–27, you will find that the color spreads throughout the water. The process
may take some time (assuming you do not shake the glass), but eventually the
color will become uniform. This mixing, known as diffusion, is readly explained by
kinetic theory as due to the random movement of the molecules. Diffusion occurs
in gases too. Common examples include perfume or smoke (or the odor of some-
thing cooking on a stove) diffusing in air, although convection (moving air currents)
often plays a greater role in spreading odors than does diffusion. Diffusion
depends on concentration, by which we mean the number of molecules or moles
per unit volume. In general, the diffusing substance moves from a region where
its concentration is high to a region where its conce
