119. A flask of nutrient broth, buffered to maintain pH, is
inoculated with a strain of E. coli. The flask is placed in a
constant temperature environment where it is aerated by
shaking.
A. Predict the effect of a change in energy availability
over time.
B. Represent the change graphically in terms of the
number of cells as a function of time.
C. In your graph as time progresses there is a change in the
growth rate of the population. Add annotation to your
graph to describe the time interval during which the
growth rate is increasing linearly in proportion to the
number of cells. Add annotation to your graph to describe
another time interval during which the growth rate is
decreasing in proportion
