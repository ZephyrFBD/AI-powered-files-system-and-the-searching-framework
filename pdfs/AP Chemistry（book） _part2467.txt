15.7 When lead(IV) oxide is heated above 300 °C, it decom-
poses according to the following reaction PbO21s2 ∆
PbO1s2 + O21g2. Consider the two sealed vessels of PbO2 
shown here. If both vessels are heated to 400 °C and 
allowed to come to equilibrium, which of the following 
statements is true? (a) There will be less PbO2 remaining 
in vessel A, (b) There will be less PbO2 remaining in vessel 
B, (c) The amount of PbO2 remaining in each vessel will 
be the same. [Section 15.4]
