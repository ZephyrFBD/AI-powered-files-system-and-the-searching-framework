There was not a clear correlation between energy and time of
arrival. Nonetheless, a careful analysis of that experiment set a rough upper limit
on the electron antineutrino mass of about 
The more recent results
mentioned above are much more definitive—they provide evidence that mass is
much smaller, and that it is not zero—but precise neutrino masses still elude us.
32–6 Particle Classification
In the decades after the discovery of the 
meson in the late 1940s, hundreds of
other subnuclear particles were discovered. One way to categorize the particles
is according to their interactions, since not all particles interact via all four of the
forces known in nature (though all interact via gravity). Table 32–2 (next page) lists
some of the more common particles classified in this way along with many of their
properties. At the top of Table 32–2 are the so-called “fundamental” particles which
we believe have no internal structure. Below them are some of the “composite”
particles which are
