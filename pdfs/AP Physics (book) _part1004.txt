or whose total
(loaded) mass is not to exceed 3100 kg. If the maximum
acceleration of the elevator is 
calculate the diam-
eter of cable required. Assume a safety factor of 8.0.
*9–7 Arches and Domes
*57. (II) How high must a pointed arch be if it is to span a space
8.0 m wide and exert one-third the horizontal force at its
base that a round arch would?
*58. (II) The subterranean tension ring that exerts the balancing
horizontal force on the abutments for the dome in Fig. 9–34
is 36-sided, so each segment makes a 10° angle with the
adjacent one (Fig. 9–77). Calculate the tension F that must
exist in each segment so that the required force of
can be exerted at each corner (Example 9–13).

59. A woman holds a 2.0-m-long uniform 10.0-kg pole as shown
in Fig. 9–78. (a) Determine the forces she must exert with
each hand (magnitude and direction). To what position
should she move her left hand so that 
neither hand has to exert a force
greater than (b) 150 N? (c) 85 N?
