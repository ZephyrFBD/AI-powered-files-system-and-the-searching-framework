 to prepare the buffer. According to Equation 17.5, for example, the pH of a 1-L 
solution that is 1 M in CH3COOH and 1 M in CH3COONa is the same as the pH of a 1-L 
solution that is 0.1 M in CH3COOH and 0.1 M in CH3COONa. The first solution has a 
greater buffering capacity, however, because it contains more CH3COOH and CH3COO-.
The pH range of any buffer is the pH range over which the buffer acts effectively. Buf-
fers most effectively resist a change in pH in either direction when the concentrations of 
weak acid and conjugate base are about the same. From Equation 17.9 we see that when 
the concentrations of weak acid and conjugate base are equal, pH = pKa. This relation-
ship gives the optimal pH of any buffer. Thus, we usually try to select a buffer whose acid 
form has a pKa close to the desired pH. In practice, we find that if the concentration of 
one component of the buffer is more than 10 times the concentration of the other com-
ponent, the buffering action is poor. Because
