 provide one example of each.
a.
Carbon sources, such as burning fossil fuels, produce carbon while carbon sinks, such as oceans, absorb
carbon.
b.
Carbon sources, such as volcanic activity, absorb carbon while carbon sinks, such as vegetation, produce
carbon.
c.
Carbon sources, such as vegetation, produce carbon while carbon sinks, such as volcanic activity, absorb
carbon.
d.
Carbon sources, such as volcanic activity, produce carbon while carbon sinks, such as burning fossil fuels,
absorb carbon.
The Biological Carbon Cycle
Living organisms are connected in many ways, even between ecosystems. A good example of this connection is the
exchange of carbon between autotrophs and heterotrophs within and between ecosystems by way of atmospheric carbon
dioxide. Carbon dioxide is the basic building block that most autotrophs use to build multi-carbon, high energy compounds,
such as glucose. The energy harnessed from the sun is used by these organisms to form the covalent bonds that link
carbon
