An appropriate sample size for the experiment is 150 plants. Figure 19.3 is
a histogram that shows the number of trichomes in the first plant
population.

Figure 19.3 Trichome Numbers
Letâ€™s assume the class decides to breed the plants to increase the number
of trichomes. Select the least hairy 10% of your original population of
plants to use in your experiment. Perform one round of artificial selection
by cross-pollinating the plants you have selected. After the F1 plants
germinate, mature, and flower, collect the seeds and grow them to produce
another generation. As a control, pollinate an equal number of plants from
the original population that were not part of your experimental group.
Remember to keep the controls separate from the experimental plants. The
histogram in Figure 19.4 shows the data from the F2 experimental plants,
which were selected for having fewer trichomes.
