s, the frequency of the yellow
allele would likely decrease over time.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) If both of the parental plants in the cross are heterozygous, one would expect  of the progeny to be tall and 
 of the progeny to be short. TT and Tt plants would be tall, and tt plants would be short.
(b) The independent variable is the presence or absence of Supersize Food. The dependent variable is the
number of plants that are tall or short. One appropriate constant might be the amount of light the plants were
exposed to. Other appropriate constants include the amount of water the plants were given or the type of soil
the plants were grown in.
(c) Using the chi-square equation:
There are two possible outcomes in the experiment (tall or short), so there is one degree of freedom (df =
number of possible outcomes â€“ 1). Using a p-value of 0.05 and the chi-square table, the critical value is
3.84. The calculated chi-square value of 1.94 is less than the critical value. So it fails to reject
