for many atoms, because (as we have seen) the wavelength of the shortest
characteristic X-rays emitted will be inversely proportional to 
Actually,
for an electron jumping from, say, the 
to the 
level (
line), the
wavelength is inversely proportional to 
because the nucleus is shielded
by the one electron that still remains in the 1s level. In 1914, H. G. J. Moseley
(1887–1915) found that a plot of 
vs. Z produced a straight line, Fig. 28–12,
where 
is the wavelength of the 
line. The Z values of a number of elements
were determined by fitting them to such a Moseley plot. The work of Moseley put
the concept of atomic number on a firm experimental basis.
