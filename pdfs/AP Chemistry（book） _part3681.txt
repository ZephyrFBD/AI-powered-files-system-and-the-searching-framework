n and hemoglobin, the iron is coordinated 
to the four nitrogen atoms of a porphyrin and to a nitrogen atom 
from the protein chain (Figure 23.15). In hemoglobin, the sixth 
position around the iron is occupied either by O2 (in oxyhemo-
globin, the bright red form) or by water (in deoxyhemoglobin, the 
purplish red form). The oxy form is the one shown in Figure 23.15.
Carbon monoxide is poisonous because the equilibrium 
binding constant of human hemoglobin for CO is about 210 times 
greater than that for O2. As a result, a relatively small quantity of 
CO can inactivate a substantial fraction of the hemoglobin in the 
blood by displacing the O2 molecule from the heme-containing 
subunit. For example, a person breathing air that contains only 
0.1% CO takes in enough CO after a few hours to convert up to 
60% of the hemoglobin (Hb) into COHb, thereby reducing the 
bloodâ€™s normal oxygen-carrying capacity by 60%.
Under normal conditions, a nonsmoker breathing unpol-
luted air has about 0
