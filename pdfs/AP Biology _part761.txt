are antigen-presenting cells that gobble up
antigens and present them to the immune system. B lymphocytes
produce antibodies.
(D) Donor blood type O has no antigens on the surface of its red
blood cells, while recipient blood type AB has no antibodies
circulating in its plasma. Therefore, the recipient has no antibodies
to clot the donor’s blood. Type A blood has A antigens on the
surface of its red blood cells and antibodies against B (anti-B)
circulating in its plasma. Type B has B antigens on the surface of its
red blood cells and antibodies against A (anti-A) circulating in its
plasma. AB blood has A and B antigens on the surface of its red
blood cells, but no circulating antibodies to both A and B antigens.
Choice B is not the best answer because the fact that type O blood
has been classified as the “universal donor” does not provide
sufficient scientific reasoning as to why choice B is the safest option
of those listed. In fact, although type O blood is called the “universal
dono
