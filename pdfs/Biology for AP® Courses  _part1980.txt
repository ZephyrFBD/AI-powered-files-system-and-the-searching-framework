of platypuses are an adaptation for swimming. The snow leopards’ thick fur is an adaptation for living in the cold. The
cheetahs’ fast speed is an adaptation for catching prey.
These adaptations can occur through the rearrangements of entire genomes or can be caused by the mutation of a single
gene. For example, dogs have 78 chromosomes while cats have 38. A large number of the characteristics that distinguish
dogs from cats arose from chromosomal rearrangements that have occurred since both groups diverged from their last
common ancestor. On the other hand, certain mice are white and other mice are black. The difference in fur color occurs
through the mutation of a single gene. Thus, as a result of a single mutation, a mouse population can become more adapted
to survive in snowy environments versus a dark, forest floor.
