 clearly indicated.
Question 3
For this question, describe the various mechanisms that influence embryonic development, including mechanisms of
gene expression: embryonic induction, apoptosis, gene regulation, morphogens, DNA methylation, microRNAs, and
homeotic genes. Experiments you can cite include the dorsal lip induction of the notochord (for embryonic
induction), the effect of mutant homeotic genes in fruit flies (for gene regulation), and the importance of the gray
crescent (for the influence of egg cytoplasm). Also mention Hans Spemann. Past AP exams indicate that the subject
of development is one of the few areas where you may need to give historical informationâ€”the names of biologists
and a description of their experiments.
Animal Behavior
Review
In its quest to evaluate your understanding of how living things survive and reproduce, the AP exam will ask you
questions about how animals respond to external stimuli. These stimuli may originate from the physical environment
or th
