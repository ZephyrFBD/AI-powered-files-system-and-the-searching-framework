Factors
It is often necessary to use several conversion factors in solving a problem. As an exam-
ple, letâ€™s convert the length of an 8.00-m rod to inches. The table on the back inside cover 
does not give the relationship between meters and inches. It does, however, give the re-
lationship between centimeters and inches 11 in. = 2.54 cm2. From our knowledge of SI 
prefixes, we know that 1 cm = 10-2 m. Thus, we can convert step by step, first from me-
ters to centimeters and then from centimeters to inches:
Combining the given quantity (8.00 m) and the two conversion factors, we have
Number of inches = 18.00 m2a 1 cm
10-2 m
b a
1 in.
2.54 cmb = 315 in.
The first conversion factor is used to cancel meters and convert the length to centime-
ters. Thus, meters are written in the denominator and centimeters in the numerator. 
 
The second conversion factor is used to cancel centimeters and convert the length to inches, 
so it has centimeters in the denominator and inches, the desired unit,
