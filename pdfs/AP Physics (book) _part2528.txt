ays leave a single point 
on the object. After reflection from a (small)
mirror, the point at which these rays cross is the image point 
All other rays
from the same object point will also pass through this image point. To find the
image point for any object point, only these three types of rays need to be drawn.
Only two of these rays are needed, but the third serves as a check.
We have shown the image point in Fig. 23–15 only for a single point on the
object. Other points on the object are imaged nearby. For instance, the bottom of
the arrow, on the principal axis at point O, is imaged on the axis at point I. So a
complete image of the object is formed (dashed arrow in Fig. 23–15c). Because the
light actually passes through the image, this is a real image that will appear on a
white surface or film placed there. This can be compared to the virtual image
formed by a plane mirror (the light does not pass through that image, Fig. 23–7).
The image in Fig. 23–15 can be seen by the eye onl
