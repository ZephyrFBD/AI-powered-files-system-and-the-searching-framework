a much lower solubility in bio-
logical ﬂuids than N2. For example, divers working at a depth of 100 ft 
 
experience a pressure of about 4 atm. At this pressure, a mixture of 95% 
 
helium and 5% oxygen gives an oxygen partial pressure of about 
 
0.2 atm, which is the partial pressure of oxygen in normal air at 1 atm. 
If the oxygen partial pressure becomes too great, the urge to breathe 
is reduced, CO2 is not removed from the body, and CO2 poisoning 
occurs. At excessive concentrations in the body, carbon dioxide acts 
as a neurotoxin, interfering with nerve conduction and transmission.
