he EDTA chelates the lead, allowing it to be removed from 
the body via urine.
Give It Some Thought
Cobalt(III) has a coordination number of 6 in all its complexes. Is the carbonate ion a 
monodentate or bidentate ligand in the 3Co(NH3)4(CO3)4 + ion?
Metals and Chelates in Living Systems
Ten of the 29 elements known to be necessary for human life are transition metals. 
 
 (Section 2.7, “Elements Required by Living Organisms”) These 10 elements—V, Cr, 
Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, and Cd—form complexes with a variety of groups present in 
biological systems.
Although our bodies require only small quantities of metals, deficiencies can lead to 
serious illness. A deficiency of manganese, for example, can lead to convulsive disorders. 
Some epilepsy patients have been helped by the addition of manganese to their diets.
