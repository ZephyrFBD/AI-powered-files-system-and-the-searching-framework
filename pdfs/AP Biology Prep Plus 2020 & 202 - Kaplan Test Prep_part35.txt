e will reach a higher point in the flowering plant
because the vessel walls in Myrothamnus do not interact with
water and have lower adhesion forces.
(C)
No movement of water will be observed in the wilted
Myrothamnus because the hydrophobic lining interferes with
the cohesion of water molecules.

hopes to determine its origin. The nucleic acid consists of a single
strand and does not have characteristics of a viral nucleic acid.
