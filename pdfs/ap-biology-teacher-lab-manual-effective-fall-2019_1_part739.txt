icals such as 
HCl or NaOH should be no more concentrated than 0.1 M, and care should be given 
when these solutions are made and used. 
•  Construction of choice chamber: For eight lab groups, collect at least 16 plastic water 
bottles with caps. Soft plastic bottles are best because they are easy to cut. Obtain 
extra caps in order to change the conditions for the choice chamber. While all of the 
bottles do not need to be the same size, collect pairs of the same type so that each 
team has two matching bottles. The choice chambers can vary in size from team to 
team. Students should cut off the bottom of the bottle using scissors, rinse out the 
bottle, and dry the bottle with towels if there is any liquid remaining. Then they 
match two bottles end-to-end on the cut side, use clear plastic packing tape to tape 
the bottles together, and label one side “
A” and the other “B” (see Figure 2). They can 
remove the caps to add cotton balls with the testing substances.
