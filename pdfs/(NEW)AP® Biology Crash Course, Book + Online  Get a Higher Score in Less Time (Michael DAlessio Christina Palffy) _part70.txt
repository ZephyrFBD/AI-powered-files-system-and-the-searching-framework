ass through the plasma membrane and bind to
receptor proteins within the cytoplasm or the nucleus of cells.
i.
Hormone binding to a cytoplasmic receptor may trigger the response in the target cell.
ii. Some steroids enter the nucleus bound to DNA regulatory proteins and stimulate transcription of
specific genes.
C. Cells can also communicate cell to cell. Examples include antigen-presenting helper T cells, Killer T cells,
and plasmodesmata between plant cells that allow the transport of materials from cell to cell.
D. Signal transmission between cells can also affect gene expression. For example, cytokines can regulate
gene expression by regulating cell replication and division, and ethylene levels signal changes in specific
enzymes in fruit that indicate that it is time to ripen.
E. Communication between cells also affects cell function. For example, changes in the activity of gene p53
can cause cancer.
