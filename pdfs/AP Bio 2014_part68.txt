 
allele because broad leaves appear in every 
generation. 
(B) The purple allele is dominant to the white 
allele because all the offspring from the 
cross of purple-flowered and white-
flowered plants had purple flowers. 
(C) The narrow allele is codominant with the 
purple allele because the purple-flower trait 
and the narrow-leaf trait segregate together. 
(D) The white allele is dominant to both the 
broad and narrow alleles because plants 
with either type of leaf shape can have 
white flowers. 
 
 
 
32. In Table II, the F1 offspring of the cross between 
broad-leaved, white-flowered plants with narrow-
leaved, purple-flowered plants have a phenotype 
that differs from that of either parent. However, 
many testcross offspring have the same phenotype 
as one of the two plants in the parental cross, but 
relatively few testcross offspring have the same 
phenotype as the F1 offspring. Which of the 
following best explains the observation? 
(A) Recombination between the leaf-shape
