ice, it is necessary to work with large sample sizes because small sample sizes are prone
to deviations caused by chance. The large quantities of pea plants that Mendel examined allowed him calculate the
probabilities of the traits appearing in his F2 generation. As you will learn, this discovery meant that when parental traits
were known, the offspring’s traits could be predicted accurately even before fertilization.

In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What is the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes in dominant and recessive gene systems?
•
How can a Punnett square be used to calculate expected proportions of genotypes and phenotypes in a monohybrid
cross?
•
How do phenomena such as incomplete dominance, codominance, recessive lethals, multiple alleles, and sex
linkage explain deviations
