 24.41  The molar heat of combustion of gaseous cyclopro-
pane is -2089 kJ>mol; that for gaseous cyclopentane is 
-3317 kJ>mol. Calculate the heat of combustion per CH2 
group in the two cases, and account for the difference.
 24.42  The heat of combustion of decahydronaphthalene 
1C10H182 is -6286 kJ>mol. The heat of combustion of 
naphthalene 1C10H82 is -5157 kJ>mol. (In both cases 
CO21g2 and H2O1l2 are the products.) Using these data and 
data in Appendix C, calculate the heat of hydrogenation 
and the resonance energy of naphthalene.
