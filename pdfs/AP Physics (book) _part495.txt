 are not aware of any force of
attraction between ordinary-sized objects, such as between two baseballs. The
force between two ordinary objects was first measured by Henry Cavendish in
1798, over 100 years after Newton published his law. To detect and measure the
incredibly small force between ordinary objects, he used an apparatus like that
shown in Fig. 5–18. Cavendish confirmed Newton’s hypothesis that two objects
attract one another and that Eq. 5–4 accurately describes this force. In addition,
because Cavendish could measure 
and r accurately, he was able to
determine the value of the constant G as well. The accepted value today is
(See Table inside front cover for values of all constants to highest known precision.)
Equation 5–4 is called an inverse square law because the force is inversely propor-
tional to 
[Strictly speaking, Eq. 5–4 gives the magnitude of the gravitational force that
one particle exerts on a second particle that is a distance r away. For an extended
object (t
