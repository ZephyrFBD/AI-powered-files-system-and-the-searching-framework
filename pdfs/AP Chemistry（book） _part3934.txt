 24.91  Which of the following peptides have a net positive charge 
at pH 7? (a) Gly-Ser-Lys, (b) Pro-Leu-Ile, (c) Phe-Tyr-Asp.
 24.92  Glutathione is a tripeptide found in most living cells. Par-
tial hydrolysis yields Cys-Gly and Glu-Cys. What structures 
are possible for glutathione?
 24.93  Monosaccharides can be categorized in terms of the 
number of carbon atoms (pentoses have five carbons and 
hexoses have six carbons) and according to whether they 
contain an aldehyde (aldo- prefix, as in aldopentose) or 
ketone group (keto- prefix, as in ketopentose). Classify glu-
cose and fructose in this way.
 24.94  Can a DNA strand bind to a complementary RNA strand? 
Explain.
