 to be
stored in the flywheel. (b) What is the angular velocity of the
flywheel when it has a full “energy charge”? (c) About how
long would it take a 150-hp motor to give the flywheel a full
energy charge before a trip?
*7. A person stands on a platform, initially at rest, that can
rotate freely without friction. The moment of inertia of the
person plus the platform is 
The person holds a spinning
bicycle wheel with its axis horizontal. The wheel has moment
of inertia 
and angular velocity 
What will be the
angular velocity 
of the platform if the person moves 
the axis of the wheel so that it points (a) vertically upward,
(b) at a 60° angle to the vertical, (c) vertically downward?
(d) What will 
be if the person reaches up and stops the
wheel in part (a)? See Sections 8–8 and 8–9.
