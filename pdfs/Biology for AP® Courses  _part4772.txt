ere forest loss is primarily from timber extraction, 272,000 km2 was lost out of a global total of 11,564,000
km2 (or 2.4 percent). In the tropics, these losses certainly also represent the extinction of species because of high levels of
endemism.

Figure 38.11 (a) One species of orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus, is found only in the rainforests of Borneo, and
the other species of orangutan (Pongo abelii) is found only in the rainforests of Sumatra. These animals are
examples of the exceptional biodiversity of (c) the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. Other species include the (b)
Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) and the (d) Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus), both
critically endangered species. Rainforest habitat is being removed to make way for (e) oil palm plantations such as this
one in Borneoâ€™s Sabah Province. (credit a: modification of work by Thorsten Bachner; credit b: modification of work
