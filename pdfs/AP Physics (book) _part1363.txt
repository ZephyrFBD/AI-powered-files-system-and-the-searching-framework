51. (II) The two sources of sound in Fig. 12–16 face each other
and emit sounds of equal amplitude and equal frequency
(305 Hz) but 180° out of phase. For what minimum separa-
tion of the two speakers will there be some point at which 
(a) complete constructive interference occurs and (b) com-
plete destructive interference occurs. (Assume

52. (II) Two piano strings are supposed to be vibrating at
220 Hz, but a piano tuner hears three beats every 2.5 s when
they are played together. (a) If one is vibrating at 220.0 Hz,
what must be the frequency of the other (is there only one
answer)? (b) By how much (in percent) must the tension be
increased or decreased to bring them in tune?
53. (III) Two loudspeakers are 1.60 m apart. A person stands
3.00 m from one speaker and 3.50 m from the other. (a)What
is the lowest frequency at which destructive interference will
occur at this point if the sp
