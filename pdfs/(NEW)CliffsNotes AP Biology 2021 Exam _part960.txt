55. A. Reproductive isolation is the initial requirement for the evolution of two species from one species. Mutations,
genetic drift, and gene flow can cause changes that result in a population evolving into a new species, but two
species will only be created from one species if the population is divided into two groups that are reproductively
isolated.
56. B. Since the trait is X-linked, the cross is XRXr × XrY. Note that there is no allele on the Y chromosome because
an X-linked gene occurs only on the X chromosome. The Punnett square below shows that the ratio for the different
traits among the offspring is 1:1:1:1, or 1 each of red
eyed female (XRXr), white-eyed female(XrXr), red-eyed male (XRY), and white-eyed male (XrY).
 
57. C. Since the expected ratio for the genotypes is 1:1:1:1, or 25% each, the expected number of each type of fly is
0.25 × 100, or 25. Using the formula provided on the equations and formulas pages for determining
χ2 gives the
