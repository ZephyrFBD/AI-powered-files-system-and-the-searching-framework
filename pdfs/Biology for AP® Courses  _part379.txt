g polysaccharide,
with repeating units of N-acetyl- Î² -D-
glucosamine, a modified sugar.
b.
Chitin is similar to amylase, but with sulfur
linkages between the monomers.
c.
Chitin is similar to inulin, a polysaccharide with
fructose, but with additional glucose monomers.
d.
Chitin contains phosphate groups that give it a
stiffness not found in other polysaccharides.
68. What categories of amino acids would you expect to
find on the surface of a soluble protein and which would
you expect to find in the interior? Which of these are some
examples for each part of the answer?
a.
Non-polar and charged amino acids will be
present on the surface and polar in the interior of
the membrane whereas non-polar will be found
in the membrane embedded proteins.
b.
Non-polar and uncharged proteins will be found
on the surface with non-polar in the interior,
while only non-polar will be found in the
embedded proteins.
c.
Polar and charged amino acids will be found on
the surface whereas non-polar in the
