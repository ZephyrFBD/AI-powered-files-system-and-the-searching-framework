by a molecule is called photodissociation. No ions are formed when the bond between 
two atoms is cleaved by photodissociation. Instead, half the bonding electrons stay with 
one atom and half stay with the other atom. The result is two electrically neutral particles.
One of the most important processes occurring above an altitude of about 120 km is 
photodissociation of the oxygen molecule:

The minimum energy required to cause this change is determined by the bond energy (or 
dissociation energy) of O2, 495 kJ>mol.
