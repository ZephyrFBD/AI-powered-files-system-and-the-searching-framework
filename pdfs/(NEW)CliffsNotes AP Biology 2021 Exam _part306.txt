1. Answer: 0.11
Without crossing over, the homozygous recessive parent can only produce one gamete genotype and the
heterozygous parent can only produce two gamete genotypes (see Figure 8-6). Without crossing over, then, only two
kinds of progeny phenotypes are produced and they would be produced in equal numbers. These would be the
progeny in the table with the largest numbers, 652 and 683. The smaller numbers, then, represent the progeny that
are produced as a result of crossing
over. The total number of crossover progeny produced is 77 + 88, or 165. Since the total number of progeny is 77 +
88 + 652 + 683, or 1,500, the crossover frequency is 165 ÷ 1,500, or 0.11 (11%).
2. Answer:
First, find the probabilities for each gene:
Aa × Aa → ¼ AA + ½ Aa + ¼aa
Bb × Bb → ¼ BB + ½ Bb + ¼bb
CC × Cc →½ CC + ½Cc
dd × Dd → ½ Dd + ½dd
EE × EE → 1 EE
Then multiply the probabilities for each gene in the offspring: aa × BB × CC × dd × EE = ¼ × ¼ × ½ × ½ × 1 = .
