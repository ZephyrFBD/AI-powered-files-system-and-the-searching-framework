r it or it’ll spread. If you broke your arm she’d say don’t touch that 
 
 with water it’ll spread.The sore spreads into my eyes anyway and now 
 
 they’re red and yellow from the stuff that oozes and makes them stick 
 
 in the morning.They stick so hard I have to force my eyelids open with 
 
 my fingers and Mam has to scrub off that yellow stuff with a damp rag 
 
 and boric powder.The eyelashes fall off and every bit of dust in Limerick 
 
 blows into my eyes on windy days. Grandma tells me I have naked 
 
 eyes and she says it’s my own fault, all that eye trouble comes from sitting 
 
 up there at the top of the lane under the light pole in all kinds of 
 
 weather with my nose stuck in books and the same thing will happen

 to Malachy if he doesn’t give over with the reading.You can see little 
 
 Michael is getting just as bad sticking his nose in books when he should 
 
 be out playing like a healthy child. Books, books, books, says Grandma, 
 
 ye will ruin yeer eyes
