haploid organisms through mitosis.
b.
Spores are haploid precursors to gametes that
give rise to gametes when environmental
conditions are favorable.
c.
Spores are haploid reproductive cells that can
produce diploid cells without fertilization.
d.
Spores are haploid cells formed only during
asexual reproduction and so are not formed by
meiosis.
24. In prophase I, the homologous chromosomes are

chromosomes together and maintains their alignment?
a.
cohesin proteins

25. One of the ways that sexual reproduction enhances the
diversity of offspring from the same parents is through a
process called crossing over. What entities does this occur
between during prophase I?
a.
sister chromatids
b.
tetrads
c.
non-homologous chromosomes
d.
non-sister chromatids of homologous
