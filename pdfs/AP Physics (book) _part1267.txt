†Although pitch is determined mainly by frequency, it also depends to a slight extent on loudness. For
example, a very loud sound may seem slightly lower in pitch than a quiet sound of the same frequency.
12–1 Characteristics of Sound
We saw in Chapter 11, Fig. 11–26, how a vibrating drumhead produces a sound
wave in air. Indeed, we usually think of sound waves traveling in the air, because
normally it is the vibrations of the air that force our eardrums to vibrate. But sound
waves can also travel in other materials.
Two stones struck together under water can be heard by a swimmer beneath
the surface, for the vibrations are carried to the ear by the water. When you put
your ear flat against the ground, you can hear a
