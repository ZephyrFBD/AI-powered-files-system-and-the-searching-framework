any dilute aqueous solution and can 
be used to calculate either 3H+4 (if 3OH -4 is known) or 3OH -4 (if 3H+4 is known).
Calculate the concentration of H+1aq2 in (a) a solution in which 3OH -4 is 0.010 M, (b) a solution in which 3OH -4 is 
1.8 * 10-9M. Note: In this problem and all that follow, we assume, unless stated otherwise, that the temperature is 25 °C.
Solve
(a) Using Equation 16.16, we have
Analyze We are asked to calculate the 3H+4 concentration in an 
aqueous solution where the hydroxide concentration is known.
Plan We can use the equilibrium-constant expression for the auto-
ionization of water and the value of Kw to solve for each unknown 
concentration.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
