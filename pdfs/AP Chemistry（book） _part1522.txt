 bond? Explain. (c) Predict the molecular ge-
ometry of PF4Cl. How did your answer for part (b) influence 
your answer here in part (c)? (d) Would you expect the mol-
ecule to distort from its ideal electron-domain geometry? If 
so, how would it distort?
 [9.89]  The vertices of a tetrahedron correspond to four alternating 
corners of a cube. By using analytical geometry, demonstrate 
that the angle made by connecting two of the vertices to a 
point at the center of the cube is 109.5Â°, the characteristic 
angle for tetrahedral molecules.
 9.90 Fill in the blank spaces in the following chart. If the molecule 
column is blank, find an example that fulfills the conditions 
of the rest of the row.
