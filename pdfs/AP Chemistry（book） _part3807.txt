e alkanes given in Table 24.2 are written in a notation called con-
densed structural formulas. This notation reveals the way in which atoms are bonded to 
one another but does not require drawing in all the bonds. For example, the structural 
formula and the condensed structural formulas for butane 1C4H102 are
