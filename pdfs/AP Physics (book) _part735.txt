if the collision is one dimensional (head-on).]

Momentum Conservation 
and Collisions
1. Choose your system. If the situation is complex,
think about how you might break it up into separate
parts when one or more conservation laws apply.
2. Consider whether a significant net external force
acts on your chosen system; if it does, be sure the time
interval 
is so short that the effect on momentum
is negligible. That is, the forces that act between the
interacting objects must be the only significant ones
if momentum conservation is to be used. [Note: If
this is valid for a portion of the problem, you can
use momentum conservation only for that portion.]
3. Draw a diagram of the initial situa
