Free-Response Questions Some Typical Answers to Short
Questions
1. When a protein is heated above a critical temperature, it begins to lose its three-dimensional structure. When the
secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of a protein break down, as they will when excessively heated, the
structure of the protein is permanently destroyed.
2. Because water has a high specific heat capacity, its temperature changes very slowly in response to energy
changes. As a result, metabolic activities occurring in the cell that release or absorb energy do not significantly
change the temperature of the cell, allowing the internal temperature of the cell to remain fairly constant.
3. A double-helix DNA molecule consists of two single-strands of DNA. The base paring between nucleoti
