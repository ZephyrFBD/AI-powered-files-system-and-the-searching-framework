ases with the number of hydrogen atoms 
bonded to the central atom. (c) Hydrotelluric acid 1H2Te2 is 
a stronger acid than H2S because Te is more electronegative 
than S.
 16.92  Indicate whether each of the following statements is true or 
false. For each statement that is false, correct the statement 
to make it true. (a) Acid strength in a series of H ¬ A mole-
cules increases with increasing size of A. (b) For acids of the 
same general structure but differing electronegativities of 
the central atoms, acid strength decreases with increasing 
electronegativity of the central atom. (c) The strongest acid 
known is HF because fluorine is the most electronegative 
element.
Lewis Acids and Bases (Section 16.11)
 16.93  Ammonia, NH3, acts as an Arrhenius base, a Brønsted-Lowry 
base, and a Lewis base, in aqueous solution. Write out the 
reaction NH3 undergoes with water and explain what prop-
erties of ammonia correspond to each of the three defini-
tions of “base.”
