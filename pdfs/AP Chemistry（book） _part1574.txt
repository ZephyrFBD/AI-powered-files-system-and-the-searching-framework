 between volume and 
pressure 1PV = constant2, we conclude that if the volume does 
not increase on injecting more gas the pressure must increase.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
A helium balloon is filled to a volume of 5.60 L at 25 °C. 
What will the volume of the balloon become if it is put  
into liquid nitrogen to lower the temperature of the helium 
to 77 K?
(a) 17 L (b) 22 L (c) 1.4 L (d) 0.046 L (e) 3.7 L
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
An oxygen cylinder used in a hospital contains 35.4 L  
of oxygen gas at a pressure of 149.6 atm. How much volume 
would the oxygen occupy if it were transferred to a container 
that maintained a pressure of 1.00 atm if the temperature 
remains constant?

Give It Some Thought
If 1.00 mol of an ideal gas at STP were confined to a cube, what would be the 
length in cm of an edge of this cube?
