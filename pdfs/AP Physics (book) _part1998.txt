Electron speed in wire. A copper wire 3.2 mm in diameter
carries a 5.0-A current. Determine the drift velocity of the free electrons. Assume
that one electron per Cu atom is free to move (the others remain bound to the atom).
APPROACH We apply Eq. 18–10 to find the drift velocity 
if we can determine
the number n of free electrons per unit volume. Since we assume there is one
free electron per atom, the density of free electrons, n, is the same as the number
of Cu atoms per unit volume. The atomic mass of Cu is 63.5 u (see Periodic Table
inside the back cover), so 63.5 g of Cu contains one mole or 
free
electrons. To find the volume V of this amount of copper, and then
we use the mass density of copper (Table 10–1),
where
(We use 
to distinguish it here from for resistivity.)
SOLUTION The number of free electrons per unit volume,
(where
), is
The cross-sectional area of the wire is 
Then, by Eq. 18–10, the drift velocity has magnitude
