Measuring a magnetic field. A rectangular loop of wire
hangs vertically as shown in Fig. 20–14. A magnetic field 
is directed horizontally,
perpendicular to the plane of the loop, and points out of the page as represented
by the symbol 
The magnetic field 
is very nearly uniform along the horizontal
portion of wire ab (length
) which is near the center of the gap of a
large magnet producing the field. The top portion of the wire loop is out of the
field. The loop hangs from a balance (reads 0 when 
) which measures a
downward magnetic force of
when the wire carries a current
What is the magnitude of the magnetic
