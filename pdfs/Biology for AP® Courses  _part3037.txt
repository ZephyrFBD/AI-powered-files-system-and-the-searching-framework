vertebrates, the brain and spinal cord comprise the central nervous system, while neurons extending into the rest of
the body comprise the peripheral nervous system. (credit e: modification of work by Michael Vecchione, Clyde F.E.

Compared to invertebrates, vertebrate nervous systems are more complex, centralized, and specialized. While there is great
diversity among different vertebrate nervous systems, they all share a basic structure: a CNS that contains a brain and spinal
cord and a PNS made up of peripheral sensory and motor nerves. One interesting difference between the nervous systems
of invertebrates and vertebrates is that the nerve cords of many invertebrates are located ventrally whereas the vertebrate
spinal cords are located dorsally. There is debate among evolutionary biologists as to whether these different nervous system
plans evolved separately or whether the inverte
