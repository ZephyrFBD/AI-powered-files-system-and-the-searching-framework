1) There is only one treatment center in every country, and vaccine and drugs 
are distributed from the center to the epidemic areas. 
2) The demand of drugs of each epidemic area is relation to the confirmed 
cases in this area. Assume they have a linear relation. 
3) The increase cases of next circle will obey to the SIR model. 
4) Each infected person need a unit of drugs, and each susceptible person need 
a unit of vaccine. 
5) Only if one epidemic area can meet the demand of itself, than it can deliver 
vaccine and drugs to other epidemic area

we assume it is the beginning of the 49th week in Improved Model 2, so we only need 
to forecast the statistics of infected people in Sierra Leone the 50th week and later on. 
Table 1 shows the forecast through Improved Model 2 with p
