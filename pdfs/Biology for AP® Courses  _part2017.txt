two rodent populations became divided by the formation of a new lake, continued gene flow would be unlikely; therefore,
speciation would be more likely.
Biologists group allopatric processes into two categories: dispersal and vicariance. Dispersal is when a few members of a
species move to a new geographical area, and vicariance is when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms.
Scientists have documented numerous cases of allopatric speciation taking place. For example, along the west coast of
the United States, two separate sub-species of spotted owls exist. The northern spotted owl has genetic and phenotypic
differences from its close relative: the Mexican spotted owl, which lives in the south (Figure 18.14).

different climates and ecosystems. The owl is an example of allopatric speciation. (credit "northern spotted owl":
