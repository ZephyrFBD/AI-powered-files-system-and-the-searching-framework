f residual mass less
than about 1.4 solar masses cool further and become white
dwarfs, eventually fading and going out altogether. Heavier
stars contract further due to their greater gravity: the density
approaches nuclear density, the huge pressure forces electrons
to combine with protons to form neutrons, and the star becomes
essentially a huge nucleus of neutrons. This is a neutron star,
and the energy released during its final core collapse is believed
to produce supernova explosions. If the star is very massive, it
may contract even further and form a black hole, which is so
dense that no matter or light can escape from it.
In the general theory of relativity, the equivalence principle
states that an observer cannot distinguish acceleration from a
gravitational field. Said another way, gravitational and inertial
masses are the same. The theory predicts gravitational bending
of light rays to a degree consistent with experiment. Gravity 
is treated as a curvature in space and time,
