measured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). Each dot represents a galaxy. The
distance from us is obtained from the
redshift and Hubble’s law, and is given in
units of 
light-years (Gly). The point 0
represents us, our observation point. This
diagram may seem to put us at the center,
but remember that at greater distances,
fewer galaxies are bright enough to be
detected, thus resulting in an apparent
thinning out of galaxies. Note the “walls”
and “voids” of galaxies.

Summary
979
The night sky contains myriads of stars including those in the
Milky Way, which is a “side view” of our Galaxy looking along
the plane of the disk. Our Galaxy includes over 
stars.
Beyond our Galaxy are billions of other galaxies.
Astronomical distances are measured in light-years
The nearest star is about 4 ly away and the
nearest large galaxy is 2 million ly away. Our Galactic disk has
a diameter of about 100,000 ly. [Distances are sometimes speci-
fied in parsecs, where
