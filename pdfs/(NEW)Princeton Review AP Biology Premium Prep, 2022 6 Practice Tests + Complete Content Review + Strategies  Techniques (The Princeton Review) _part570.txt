3. Schizosaccharomyces pombe, or fission yeast, has a cell cycle that resembles that of mammalian cells. During
interphase, fission yeast grow to twice their normal size, and at the end of mitosis, both daughter offspring are
equal in size to the original parent cell. Genes that regulate the division of fission yeast are known as cell-
division cycle, or cdc, genes.
The following experiments were conducted to determine the effect of cdc gene mutations on yeast cell
division.
Experiment 1
In order to determine the effect of cdc mutations, wild-type cells and mutants were grown at 37°C in the
presence of a radioactive drug that specifically binds to the spindle apparatus. Stages of the cell cycle were
elucidated for both cell types incubated at this temperature. At 37°C, temperature-sensitive cdc mutants were
unable to re-enter interphase after mitosis. The illustration below depicts the results for wild-type cells and cdc
mutants.
