st-lab discussion to debrief procedures, errors, 
and conclusions. Test the students’ understanding of 
biology concepts by asking them “what if” questions 
like “Predict what will happen if….” or “What should the 
next experiment be if…”
Bullet Rephrasing or refining the learning objectives that 
align to the unit of study to create an inquiry-based 
investigation for students. 
Students should be given latitude to make design 
modifications or ask for additional equipment 
appropriate for their design. It is also helpful for 
individual groups to share with the class their basic 
design to elicit feedback on feasibility. During labs, 
students are encouraged to proceed independently, 
receiving only minor guidance from the teacher by 
the end of the course. Students should have many 
opportunities for post-lab reporting to share the 
successes and challenges of individual lab designs.
