ing is between cells that are in direct contact, so choice (B) is incorrect. Endocrine
signaling occurs over long distances, so choice (D) is incorrect.
10. (B) If a cell lacks the receptor for a ligand, the signal transduction process cannot start. Choice (A) is incorrect
because if cAMP was lacking, the cell might still be able to mount an incomplete response if the ligand could
bind to a receptor and trigger steps in the signal transduction process that do not depend on the presence of
cAMP. Ligands are usually not produced in their target cells, so lacking a gene for the ligand would likely have
no effect on the target cell, making choice (C) incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because the inability to
metabolize a ligand would likely not affect the target cellâ€™s ability to respond to the ligand.
Short Free-Response
11. (a) Receptors for hydrophilic ligands are found on the cell membrane. Receptors for hydrophobic ligands are
found in the cytosol.
(b) The cell membrane is made of a
