the shuttle’s velocity and 
acceleration are shown by the 
green 
and gold 
arrows.
Motion is described using 
the concepts of velocity and 
acceleration. In the case 
shown here, the velocity 
is 
to the right, in the direction
of motion. The acceleration 
is in the opposite direction 
from the velocity 
which 
means the object is slowing 
down.
We examine in detail motion
with constant acceleration,
including the vertical motion 
of objects falling under gravity.

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
[Don’t worry about getting the right answer now—you will get another chance later in the
Chapter. See also p. 1 of Chapter 1 for more explanation.]
Two small heavy balls have the same diameter but one weighs twice as much as
the
