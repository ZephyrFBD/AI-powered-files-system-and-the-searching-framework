orm a compound that is measured 
to be 74.0% mercury and 26.0% chlorine by mass. Thus, if we had a 100.0-g sample of 
the compound, it would contain 74.0 g of mercury and 26.0 g of chlorine. (Samples of 
any size can be used in problems of this type, but we will generally use 100.0 g to simplify 
the calculation of mass from percentage.) Using atomic weights to get molar masses, we 
calculate the number of moles of each element in the sample:
 
174.0 g Hg2a
1 mol Hg
200.6 g Hgb = 0.369 mol Hg
 
126.0 g Cl2a 1 mol Cl
35.5 g Cl b = 0.732 mol Cl
 Atoms O = 11.75 * 1022 molecules C6H12O62a
6 atoms O
molecule C6H12O6
b 
 = 1.05 * 1023 atoms O

We then divide the larger number of moles by the smaller number to obtain the Cl:Hg 
mole ratio:
moles of Cl
moles of Hg = 0.732 mol Cl
0.369 mol Hg = 1.98 mol Cl
1 mol Hg
Because of experimental errors, calculated values for a mole ratio may not be whole 
numbers, as in the calculation here. The nu
