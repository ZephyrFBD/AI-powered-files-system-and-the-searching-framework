s favorable depends on the environmental conditions at the time. The same traits are not always
selected because environmental conditions can change. For example, consider a species of plant that grew in a moist climate
and did not need to conserve water. Large leaves were selected because they allowed the plant to obtain more energy from
the sun. Large leaves require more water to maintain than small leaves, and the moist environment provided favorable
conditions to support large leaves. After thousands of years, the climate changed, and the area no longer had excess water.
The direction of natural selection shifted so that plants with small leaves were selected because those populations were able
to conserve water to survive the new environmental conditions.
The evolution of species has resulted in enormous variation in form and function. Sometimes, evolution gives rise to groups
of organisms that become tremendously different from each other. When two species evolve in diverse direc
