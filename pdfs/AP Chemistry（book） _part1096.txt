s much more likely to be found close to the 
nucleus than are the four n = 3 electrons, and, therefore, the 2p electron experiences a 
much greater effective nuclear charge than do the 3s and 3p electrons.
Every element exhibits a large increase in ionization energy when the first of its 
inner-shell electrons is removed. This observation supports the idea that only the out-
ermost electrons are involved in the sharing and transfer of electrons that give rise to 
chemical bonding and reactions. As we will see when we talk about chemical bonds in 
Chapters 8 and 9, the inner electrons are too tightly bound to the nucleus to be lost from 
the atom or even shared with another atom.
