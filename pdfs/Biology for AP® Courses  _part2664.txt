Matric Potential
Matric potential (Ψm) is always negative to zero. In a dry system, it can be as low as –2 MPa in a dry seed, and it is zero in
a water-saturated system. The binding of water to a matrix always removes or consumes potential energy from the system.
Ψm is similar to solute potential because it involves tying up the energy in an aqueous system by forming hydrogen bonds
between the water and some other component. However, in solute potential, the other components are soluble, hydrophilic
solute molecules, whereas in Ψm, the other components are insoluble, hydrophilic molecules of the plant cell wall. Every
plant cell has a cellulosic cell wall and the cellulose in the cell walls is hydrophilic, producing a matrix for adhesion of
water: hence the name matric potential. Ψm is very large (negative) in dry tissues such as seeds or drought-affected soils.
However, it quickly goes to zero as the see
