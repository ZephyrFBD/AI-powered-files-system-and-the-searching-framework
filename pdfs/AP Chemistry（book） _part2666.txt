Butyric acid is responsible for the foul smell of rancid but-
ter. The pKa of butyric acid is 4.84. (a) Calculate the pKb for 
the butyrate ion. (b) Calculate the pH of a 0.050 M solution 
of butyric acid. (c) Calculate the pH of a 0.050 M solution 
of sodium butyrate.

A 0.25 M solution of a salt NaA has pH = 9.29. What is the 
value of Ka for the parent acid HA?
 
[16.112]   The following observations are made about a diprotic acid 
H2A: (i) A 0.10 M solution of H2A has pH = 3.30. (ii) A 0.10 M 
 
solution of the salt NaHA is acidic. Which of the follow-
ing could be the value of pKa2 for H2A: (i) 3.22, (ii) 5.30, 
 
(iii) 7.47, or (iv) 9.82?
