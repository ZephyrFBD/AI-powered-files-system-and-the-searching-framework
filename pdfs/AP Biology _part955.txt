will cover one side of
the choice chamber with paper towels and leave the other side
exposed to light. After allowing some time to pass (for the flies
to get used to this environment), I will make observations for
30 minutes. Then, I will record the number of flies that remain
in each chamber at the end of the experiment.
The null hypothesis is that fruit flies demonstrate no preference
for either chamber (the presence or absence of light).
Below is a histogram that shows the results for this experiment.
After the 30 minutes that were allotted for this experiment, 24
fruit flies preferred the chamber with light while 6 fruit flies
preferred the chamber in the dark.
Given the predicted data, I would reject the null hypothesis
because clearly the fruit flies demonstrate a preference for the
presence of light. They choose the chamber with light over the
chamber in the dark: 4 to 1. The data show that, by the end of
the experiment, 24 fruit flies preferred the chamber with light,
while onl
