Capacitor Discharging
The circuit just discussed involved the charging of a capacitor by a battery
through a resistance. Now let us look at another situation: a capacitor is already
charged to a voltage 
and charge 
and it is then allowed to discharge through
a resistance R as shown in Fig. 19–21a. In this case there is no battery. When the
switch S is closed, charge begins to flow through resistor R from one side of 
the capacitor toward the other side, until the capacitor is fully discharged.
The voltage across the capacitor decreases,
