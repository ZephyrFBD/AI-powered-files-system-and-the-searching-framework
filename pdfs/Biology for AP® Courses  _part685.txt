ntropy is a measure of the disorder of the system. (Think of your bedroom as a
system. On Sunday evening, you throw dirty clothes in the laundry basket, put books back on the shelves, and return dirty
dishes to the kitchen. Cleaning your room requires an input of energy. What gradually happens as the week progresses? You
guessed it: entropy.) All biological systems obey the laws of chemistry and physics, including the laws of thermodynamics
that describe the properties and processes of energy transfer in systems. The first law states that the total amount of energy
in the universe is constant; energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transformed and transferred. The second
law states that every energy transfer involves some loss of energy in an unusable form, such as heat energy, resulting in a
more disordered system (e.g., your bedroom over the course of a week). Thus, no energy transfer is completely efficient.
(We will explore how free energy is stored, transferred, and
