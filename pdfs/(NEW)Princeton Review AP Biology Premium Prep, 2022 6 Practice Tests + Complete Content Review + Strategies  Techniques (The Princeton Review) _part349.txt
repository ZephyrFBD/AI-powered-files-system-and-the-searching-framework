pressor binds to the operator, transcription will not
occur. On the other hand, if the repressor does not bind to the operator, RNA polymerase moves right along the
operator and transcription occurs. In the lac operon, the inducer, lactose, binds to the repressor, causing it to
fall off the operator, and “turns on” transcription.
The two diagrams on the next page show the lac operon when lactose is absent (A) and when lactose is present (B).
Other operons, such as the trp operon, operate in a similar manner except that this mechanism is continually “turned
on” and is “turned off” only in the presence of high levels of the amino acid, tryptophan. Tryptophan is a product of
the pathway that codes for the trp operon. When tryptophan combines with the trp repressor protein, it causes the
repressor to bind to the operator, which turns the operon “off,” thereby blocking transcription. In other words, a high
level of tryptophan acts to repress the further synthesis of tryptophan.
