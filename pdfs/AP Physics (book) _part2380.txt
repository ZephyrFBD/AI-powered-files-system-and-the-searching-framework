Loudspeaker cross-over
Loudspeakers having separate “woofer”(low-frequency speaker) and “tweeter”
(high-frequency speaker) may use a simple “cross-over” that consists of a capaci-
tor in the tweeter circuit to impede low-frequency signals, and an inductor in the
woofer circuit to impede high-frequency signals 
Hence mainly low-
frequency sounds reach and are emitted by the woofer. See Fig. 21–42c.

1–14 LRC Series AC Circuit
Let us examine a circuit containing all three elements in series: a resistor R, an
inductor L, and a capacitor C, Fig. 21–43. If a given circuit contains only two of
these elements, we can still use the results
