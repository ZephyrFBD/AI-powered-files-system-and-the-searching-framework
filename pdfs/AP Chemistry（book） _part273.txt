lectrical charge.
Protons and neutrons reside in the tiny nucleus of the atom. The vast majority of 
an atom’s volume is the space in which the electrons reside (Figure 2.10). Most atoms 
have diameters between 1 * 10-10 m 1100 pm2 and 5 * 10-10 m 1500 pm2. A conve-
nient non-SI unit of length used for atomic dimensions is the angstrom 1A
° 2, where 
1 A
° = 1 * 10-10 m = 100 pm. Thus, atoms have diameters of approximately 1 - 5 A
° . 
The diameter of a chlorine atom, for example, is 200 pm, or 2.0 A
° .
Electrons are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the electrostatic force that 
exists between particles of opposite electrical charge. In later chapters, we will see that 
the strength of the attractive forces between electrons and nuclei can be used to explain 
many of the differences among different elements.
The diameter of an atomic nucleus is approximately 10-4 A
° , only a small fraction of 
the diameter of the atom as a whole. You can appreciate the relative sizes of the
