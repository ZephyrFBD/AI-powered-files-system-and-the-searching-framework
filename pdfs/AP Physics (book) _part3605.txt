ny particles listed in Table 32–2 are unstable. The lifetime of an unstable par-
ticle depends on which force is most active in causing the decay. When a stronger
force influences a decay, that decay occurs more quickly. Decays caused by the
weak force typically have lifetimes of 
or longer (W and Z decay directly
and more quickly). Decays via the electromagnetic force have much shorter
lifetimes, typically about 
to 
and normally involve a 
(photon).
Most of the unstable particles included in Table 32–2 decay either via the weak or
the electromagnetic interaction.
Many particles have been found that decay via the strong interaction, with
very short lifetimes, typically about 
Their lifetimes are so short they do
not travel far enough to be detected before decaying. The existence of such
short-lived particles is inferred from their decay products. Consider the first such
particle discovered (by Fermi), using a beam of 
particles with varying
amounts of energy directed through a hydroge
