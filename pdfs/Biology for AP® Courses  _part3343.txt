Figure 28.11 Insulin and glucagon regulate blood glucose levels.
Pancreatic tumors may cause excess secretion of glucagon. Type I diabetes results from the failure of the pancreas to
produce insulin. Which of the following statement about these two conditions is true?
a.
A pancreatic tumor and Type 1 diabetes will have the opposite effects on blood sugar levels.
b.
A pancreatic tumor and Type 1 diabetes can both cause hyperglycemia.
c.
A pancreatic tumor and Type 1 diabetes can both cause hypoglycemia.
d.
Both pancreatic tumors and Type 1 diabetes result in the inability of cells to take up glucose.
Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Thyroid Hormones
The basal metabolic rate, which is the amount of calories required by the body at rest, is determined by two hormones
produced by the thyroid gland: thyroxine, also known as tetraiodothyronine or T4, and triiodothyronine, also known as T3.
These hormones affect nearly every cell in the body except for the adult brain, uterus,
