, certain probabilities exist that an elec-
tron will arrive at different points. This is very different from the classical view, in
which the path of a particle is precisely predictable from the initial position and
velocity and the forces exerted on it. According to quantum mechanics, the position
and velocity of an object cannot even be known accurately at the same time.
This is expressed in the uncertainty principle, and arises because basic entities,
such as electrons, are not considered simply as particles: they have wave properties
as well. Quantum mechanics allows us to calculate only the probabilityâ€  that, say,
an electron (when thought of as a particle) will be observed at various places.
Quantum mechanics says there is some inherent unpredictability in nature. This
is very different from the deterministic view of classical mechanics.
Because matter is considered to be made up of atoms, even ordinary-sized
objects are expected to be governed by probability, rather than by str
