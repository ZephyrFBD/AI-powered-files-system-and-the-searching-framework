 the frontline defenses of
macrophages involved in the innate immune response. Some intracellular bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
have evolved to multiply in macrophages after they have been engulfed. These pathogens evade attempts by macrophages to
destroy and digest the pathogen. When M. tuberculosis infection occurs, macrophages can stimulate naïve T cells to become
TH1 cells. These stimulated T cells secrete specific cytokines that send feedback to the macrophage to stimulate its digestive
capabilities and allow it to destroy the colonizing M. tuberculosis. In the same manner, TH1-activated macrophages also
become better suited to ingest and kill tumor cells. In summary; TH1 responses are directed toward intracellular invaders
while TH2 responses are aimed at those that are extracellular.
B Lymphocytes
When stimulated by the TH2 pathway, naïve B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. A plasma cell
is an immune cell that secrets antibodies; these cel
