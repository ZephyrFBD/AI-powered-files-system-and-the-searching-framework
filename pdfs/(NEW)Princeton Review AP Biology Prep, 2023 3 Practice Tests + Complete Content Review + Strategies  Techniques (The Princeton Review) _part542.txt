for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Choices (A), (B), and (C) all prevent Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium and predict evolution. The population is small, mutations are inevitable, and humans
usually do not mate randomly. This population will definitely evolve or undergo genetic drift.

A
Choice (A) is correct because the trait is being selected based on female mating preferences. Longer, bigger
tails indicate reproductive fitness. Peahens choose males who are healthy and strong enough to grow these big
tails and will hopefully produce the best offspring. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they do not
describe the female mating preferences.

The behavior displayed by the chimpanzee represents insight because the chimpanzee has figured out how to
solve the problem without external influence or learning.

Viruses would display reproductive strategies most similar to r-strategists because they aim to reproduce as
fast as possible and create as many
