Table D–1 indicates that the 
for diatomic gases is about
times as great as
for a monatomic gas—that is, in the same ratio as their degrees of freedom. This
result led nineteenth-century physicists to the principle of equipartition of energy.
This principle states that energy is shared equally among the active degrees of
freedom, and each active degree of freedom of a molecule has on average an
energy equal to 
Thus, the average energy for a molecule of a monatomic 
gas would be 
(which we already knew) and of a diatomic gas 
Hence 
the internal energy of a diatomic gas would be 
where n
is the number of moles. Using the same argument we did for monatomic gases,
we see that for diatomic gases the
