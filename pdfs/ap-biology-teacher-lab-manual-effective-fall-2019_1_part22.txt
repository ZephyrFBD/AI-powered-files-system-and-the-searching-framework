ic, not linear; each observation or experimental 
result raises new questions about how the world works (Johnson 2009), thus leading to 
open-ended investigations.  Students also appreciate that inquiry requires identification 
of assumptions, use of critical and logical thinking, and consideration of alternative 
explanations (National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment and 
National Research Council 1996, 23). 
Inquiry-based instruction encourages students to make connections between 
concepts and big ideas and allows scaffolding of both concepts and science practices to 
increase students’ knowledge and skills, thus promoting deeper learning (see Appendix 
C for the science practices). As students work through their investigations, the teacher 
asks probing, follow-up questions to assess students’ thinking processes, understanding 
of concepts, and misconceptions. Teachers can modify these and other labs to be more 
or less inquiry based to meet their students’
