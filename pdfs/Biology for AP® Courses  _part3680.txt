the amount of oxygen that can reach some of the organs and tissues of the body, reducing the overall metabolic capacity of
fish.
In amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the

heart, which is called pulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the
brain (systemic circulation). In amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is
referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation.
As shown in Figure 31.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the
two-chambered heart of fish. The two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the
lungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heartâ€™s ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which
reduces the efficiency of oxygenation. The advant
