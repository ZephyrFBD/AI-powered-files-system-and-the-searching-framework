•  Use of different-aged fruit flies: Some experiments could be designed using fruit flies 
of different ages. To set up those cultures, be sure to have flies arrive at least two weeks 
before the experiments. Isolate any adult flies into a new vial of food. These flies will 
then be two weeks old for your tests. Young flies will not emerge until about two 
weeks later in the new culture. The original culture can then be used as young flies if 
the adults are let out of the culture the day or two before the experiments. 
•  Use of larvae: Students could design experiments using fruit fly larvae. The 
third instar larvae leave the moist food in a culture and climb up into the dryer 
environment of the vial to get ready for pupation. Students should place larvae on a 
glass slide to test for chemotaxis or phototaxis. The larvae will move more easily if a 
layer of non-nutrient agar is
