tronegativities, their MOs resemble those in homonuclear diatomics, with one import-
ant modification: The energy of the atomic orbitals of the more electronegative atom is 
lower than that of the atomic orbitals of the less electronegative element. In Figure 9.46, 
you see that the 2s and 2p atomic orbitals of oxygen are slightly lower than those of nitro-
gen because oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen. The MO energy-level diagram 
for NO is much like that of a homonuclear diatomic moleculeâ€”because the 2s and 2p 
orbitals on the two atoms interact, the same types of MOs are produced.
There is one other important difference in the MOs of heteronuclear molecules. The 
MOs are still a mix of atomic orbitals from both atoms, but in general an MO in a hetero-
nuclear diatomic molecule has a greater contribution from the atomic orbital to which it is closer 
in energy. In the case of NO, for example, the s
2s bonding MO is closer in energy to the 
O 2s atomic orbital than to the
