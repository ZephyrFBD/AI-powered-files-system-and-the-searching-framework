sure in either direction, the
frequency of the allele would remain roughly constant, (A).
56. B
Bacteria, which have short generation times, reproduce asexually and very rapidly. This
allows rare individual genetic mutations that create new alleles to have a large eﬀect on
the overall genetic diversity observed in a population. (B) is therefore correct. While
much of the genetic variation among humans is the result of sexual recombination of
existing alleles, this does not explain why the impact of mutations is greater in bacteria
populations, so (A) is incorrect. (C) is factually inaccurate; bacteria reproduce asexually.
(D) is incorrect because it is too extreme to be accurate.
57. B
The guiding principle behind chemotherapy involves utilizing the biochemical
similarities and diﬀerences between host and parasite cells. As stated in the question
stem, antimetabolites, while chemically similar enough to metabolites to allow a
reaction to proceed, are also chemically dissimilar enough t
