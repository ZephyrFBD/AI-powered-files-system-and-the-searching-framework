most coronavirus strains are nothing more than cold/ﬂu-like
symptoms’. We had farcical situations like an 84-year-old German
man testing positive for ‘Covid-19’ and his nursing home ordered to
quarantine only for him to be found to have a common cold. The
scientist described back then why PCR tests and what he called the
‘Mickey Mouse test kits’ were useless for what they were claimed to
be identifying. ‘The idea these kits can isolate a speciﬁc virus like
Covid-19 is nonsense,’ he said. Signiﬁcantly, he pointed out that ‘if
you want to create a totally false panic about a totally false pandemic
– pick a coronavirus’. This is exactly what the Cult-owned Gates,
World Economic Forum and Johns Hopkins University did with
their Event 201 ‘simulation’ followed by their real-life simulation
called the ‘pandemic’. The scientist said that all you had to do was
select the sickest of people with respiratory-type diseases in a single
location – ‘say Wuhan’ – and administer PCR tests to them
