r increases; thus, the warmer the environment, the
greater the potential for transpiration. Plants that live in hot environments must have mechanisms to conserve water,
and a lower density of stomata may be a solution.
2. Humidity. A decrease in humidity decreases the water potential in the surrounding air. In response, the rate of
transpiration increases. Dry habitats often accompany hot environments. Plants that live in dry habitats must have
mechanisms that conserve water loss, and a lower density of stomata may be a solution.
However, not all dry habitats experience hot or even warm temperatures. Alpine habitats and other habitats with
prolonged snow coverage are dry habitats except during the short period of the year when the snow is melting.
(Plants canâ€™t absorb water in the form of snow or ice.) In contrast, plants that live in moist habitats, where water is
readily available, can easily remediate water loss from transpiration.
3. Air movement. Moving air removes recently evapor
