ly that you know the general structure of a nucleotide (nitrogen base + five-carbon sugar + phosphate),
the names of the nucleotides, which are double-ring purines and which are single-ring pyrimidines, and the
differences between DNA and RNA.
Chemical Reactions in Metabolic Processes
In order for a chemical reaction to take place, the reacting molecules (or atoms) must first collide and then have
sufficient energy (activation energy) to trigger the formation of new bonds. Although many reactions can occur
spontaneously, the presence of a catalyst accelerates the rate of the reaction because it lowers the activation energy
required for the reaction to take place. A catalyst is any substance that accelerates a reaction but does not undergo a
chemical change itself. Since the catalyst is not changed by the reaction, it can be used over and over again.
Chemical reactions that occur in biological systems are referred to as metabolism. Metabolism includes the
breakdown of substances (catabo
