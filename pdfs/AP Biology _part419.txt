tructures and of evolutionary relationships.
The wing of a bat, the lateral fin of a whale, and the human arm all
have the same internal bone structure, although the function of each
varies. These structures, known as homologous structures, have a
common origin and reflect a common ancestry. See Figure 11.1.
Analogous structures, such as a bat’s wing and a fly’s wing, have
the same function. However, the similarity is superficial and

reflects an adaptation to similar environments, not descent from a
recent common ancestor.
Vestigial structures, such as the appendix, are evidence that
structures have evolved. The appendix is a vestige of a structure
needed when human ancestors ate a very different diet.

Organisms that have a common ancestor will have common biochemical
pathways. The more closely related the organisms are to each other, the
more simi
