d. Mode of nutrition
 
Bacteria: photosynthesis producing oxygen, photosynthesis producing sulfur, chemosynthesis (chemolithotrophy)
using
 
inorganic molecules (or sulfur or nitrogen compounds or H2S,
 
NH3−, or NO2−), or heterotrophs (chemoheterotrophs)
 
Archaea: chemosynthesis (chemolithotrophy)
 
Plants: photosynthesis (producing oxygen); (also heterotrophic parasitic plants)
 
Fungi: heterotrophs
 
Animals: heterotrophs
 
e. Motility
 
Bacteria: flagella without 9 + 2 microtubule arrangement (motion
 
like that of spinning propeller); (energy from H+ gradient)
Archaea: flagella different from those of bacteria, without 9 + 2 microtubule arrangement; (motion like that of
spinning propeller); (energy from ATP)
Plants: mostly absent; with 9 + 2 microtubule arrangement when present, as in some gametes
 
Fungi: mostly absent; without 9 + 2 microtubule arrangement when present
 
Animals: flagella and cilia with 9 + 2 microtubule array (energy from ATP); (motion is whip-like)
