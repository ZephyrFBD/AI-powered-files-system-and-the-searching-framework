3 ligands at 27 °C:
3Cu(H2O)442+(aq) + 2 NH3(aq) ∆
 
 3Cu(H2O)2(NH3)242+(aq) + 2 H2O(l)
∆H° = -46 kJ; ∆S° = -8.4 J>K; ∆G° = -43 kJ
The thermodynamic data tell us about the relative abilities of 
H2O and NH3 to serve as ligands in this reaction. In general, NH3 
binds more tightly to metal ions than does H2O, so this substitution 
reaction is exothermic (∆H 6 0). The stronger bonding of the NH3 
ligands also causes the 3Cu(H2O)2(NH3)242+ ion to be more rigid, 
which is probably the reason ∆S° is slightly negative.
We can use Equation 19.20, ∆G° = -RT ln K, to calculate 
the equilibrium constant of the reaction at 27 °C. The result, 
K = 3.1 * 107, tells us that the equilibrium lies far to the right, 
favoring replacement of H2O by NH3. For this equilibrium, therefore, 
the enthalpy change, ∆H° = -46 kJ, is large enough and negative 
enough to overcome the entropy change, ∆S° = -8.4 J>K.
Now let’s use a single bidentate ethylenediamine (en) ligand in 
our substitution reaction:
3Cu(H2O)4
