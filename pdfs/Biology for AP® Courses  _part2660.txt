h side of the tube (Ψtotalright or left), and therefore, the difference
between Ψtotal on each side (ΔΨ). (Ψm , the potential due to interaction of water with solid substrates, is ignored
in this example because glass is not especially hydrophilic). Water moves in response to the difference in water
potential between two systems (the left and right sides of the tube).
Positive water potential is applied on the left side of a tube by increasing Ψp so that the water level rises on the right
side. The equation for water potential is: Ψsystem = Ψtotal = Ψs + Ψp + Ψg + Ψm where Ψs, Ψp, Ψg, and Ψm refer to
the solute, pressure, gravity, and matric potentials, respectively. Could you equalize the water level on each side of the
tube by adding solute?
a.
Yes, water level can be equalized by adding solute to the right side of the tube so that water moves toward
the left until the water levels are equal.
b.
No, water level cannot be equalized on both sides of the tubes by adding solutes with no
