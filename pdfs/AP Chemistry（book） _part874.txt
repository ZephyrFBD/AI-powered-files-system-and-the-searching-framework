ctrons in these 
excited atoms lose energy and fall back to their ground state orbitals.
 
6.1 ▶ The Wave Nature of Light Learn that  
light (radiant energy, or electromagnetic 
radiation) has wave-like properties and is 
characterized by wavelength, frequency, and 
speed.
 
6.2 ▶ Quantized Energy and Photons  
Recognize that electromagnetic radiation 
also has particle-like properties and can be 
described as “particles” of light called photons.
 
6.3 ▶ Line Spectra and the Bohr Model  
Examine the light emitted by electrically excited 
atoms (line spectra) and infer from those spectra 
that only certain energy levels are allowed for 
electrons in atoms. These observations lead to 
the Bohr model of the atom, which pictures the 
electrons moving around the nucleus only in 
certain allowed orbits.
 
6.4 ▶ The Wave Behavior of Matter  
Recognize that matter also has wave-like 
properties. As a result, it is impossible to 
determine simultaneously the exact position 
and the exact moment
