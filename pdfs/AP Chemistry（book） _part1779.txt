crystalline materials.
Liquid phase
Molecules 
arranged 
randomly
Nematic liquid 
crystalline phase
Long axes of 
molecules 
aligned, but ends 
are not aligned
Smectic A liquid 
crystalline phase
Molecules aligned 
in layers, long 
axes of molecules 
perpendicular to 
layer planes
Smectic C liquid 
crystalline phase
Molecules aligned 
in layers, long 
axes of molecules 
inclined with 
respect to layer 
planes
Cholesteric liquid 
crystalline phase
Molecules pack into 
layers, long axes of 
molecules in one layer 
rotated relative to the 
long axes in the layer 
above it
â–² Figure 11.32 Molecular order in nematic, smectic, and cholesteric liquid crystals. In the liquid phase  
of any substance, the molecules are arranged randomly, whereas in the liquid crystalline phases the  
molecules are arranged in a partially ordered way.
illustrated in Figure 11.32. Depending on the nature of the ordering, liquid crystals are 
classified as nematic, smectic A, smectic C, or cholesteric.
