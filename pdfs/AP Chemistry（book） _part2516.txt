es as a base. To be a Brønsted–Lowry acid, a molecule or ion must have a 
hydrogen atom it can lose as an H+ ion. To be a Brønsted–Lowry base, a molecule or ion 
must have a nonbonding pair of electrons it can use to bind the H+ ion.
Some substances can act as an acid in one reaction and as a base in another. For 
example, H2O is a Brønsted–Lowry base in Equation 16.3 and a Brønsted–Lowry acid in 
Equation 16.5. A substance capable of acting as either an acid or a base is called amphi-
protic. An amphiprotic substance acts as a base when combined with something more 
strongly acidic than itself and as an acid when combined with something more strongly 
basic than itself.

Give It Some Thought
In the forward reaction of this equilibrium, which substance acts as the Brønsted–
Lowry base?
