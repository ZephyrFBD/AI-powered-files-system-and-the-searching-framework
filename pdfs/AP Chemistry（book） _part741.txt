homes to store heat. Assume that the specific heat of 
the rocks is 0.82 J>g@K. Calculate the quantity of heat 
absorbed by 50.0 kg of rocks if their temperature increases 
by 12.0 °C. (b) What temperature change would these 
rocks undergo if they emitted  450 kJ of heat?

endothermic reaction: Heat is gained by the reaction and lost by the water in the solu-
tion, and the temperature of the solution decreases. The heat gained or lost by the solu-
tion, qsoln, is therefore equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the heat absorbed or 
released by the reaction, qrxn, in mathematical terms qsoln = -qrxn. The value of qsoln is 
readily calculated from the mass of the solution, its specific heat, and the temperature 
change:
 
qsoln = 1specific heat of solution2 * 1grams of solution2 * ∆T = -qrxn

For dilute aqueous solutions we usually assume that the specific heat of the solution is the 
same as that of water, 4.18 J>g@K.
