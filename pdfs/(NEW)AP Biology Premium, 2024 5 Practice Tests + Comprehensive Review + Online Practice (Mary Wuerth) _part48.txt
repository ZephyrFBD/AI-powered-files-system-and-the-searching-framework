ing data sets. In the previous example, the 95% confidence intervals for generations 1
and 2 do not overlap. If the 95% confidence intervals for two sets of data do not overlap, it is likely there is a
statistically significant difference between the two groups. In that example, there is likely a statistically significant
difference between the mean plant heights on day 28 for generations 1 and 2.
However, if the 95% confidence intervals do overlap, the data are inconclusive, and it is not possible to say
whether or not there is a significant difference between the groups. The experiment would need to be repeated. Here
is another example that illustrates this point.
On field trips to a salt marsh, an AP Biology class counted the number of crustaceans in a 100 cm2 quadrant.
Three different locations in the marsh were visited, and multiple quadrants were counted at each location. The mean
number of crustaceans per quadrant and the standard error of the mean were calculated from the data
