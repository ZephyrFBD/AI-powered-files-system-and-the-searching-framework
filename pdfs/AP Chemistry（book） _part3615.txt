 22.28  The H2>O2 fuel cell converts elemental hydrogen and oxy-
gen into water, producing, theoretically, 1.23 V. What is 
the most sustainable way to obtain hydrogen to run a large 
number of fuel cells? Explain.
 22.29  Why does xenon form stable compounds with fluorine, 
whereas argon does not?
 22.30  A friend tells you that the “neon” in neon signs is a com-
pound of neon and aluminum. Can your friend be correct? 
Explain.
 22.31  Write the chemical formula for each of the following, and

atom in each: (a) calcium hypobromite, (b) bromic acid, 
(c) xenon trioxide, (d) perchlorate ion, (e) iodous acid, 
 
(f) iodine pentafluoride.
 22.32  Write the chemical formula for each of the following com-
pounds, and indicate the oxidation state of the halogen 
or noble-gas atom in each: (a) chlorate ion, (b) hydroio-
dic acid, (c) iodine trichloride, (d) sodium hypochlorite,
