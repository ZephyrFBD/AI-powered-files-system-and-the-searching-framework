types, but as a range of varieties. The heights of humans, for example, are not just short or tall but are displayed as a
continuous variation from very short to very tall. Continuous variation usually results from polygenic inheritance,
the interaction of many genes to shape a single phenotype.
Linked Genes
If two genes are on different chromosomes, such as the seed color and seed texture genes of pea plants, the genes
segregate independently of one another (law of independent assortment). Linked genes are genes that reside on the
same chromosome and thus cannot segregate independently because they are physically connected. Genes that are
linked do not obey the law of independent assortment and are usually inherited together.
In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, flies reared in the laboratory occasionally exhibit mutations in their genes.
Two such mutations, affecting body color and wing structure, are linked. The normal, or wild, body color is gray
(B), while the
