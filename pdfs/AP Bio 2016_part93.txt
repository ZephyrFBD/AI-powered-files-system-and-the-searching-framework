cus with three alleles by using the 
following equations. 
p2 + q2 + r2 + 2pq + 2pr + 2qr = 1 
p + q + r = 1 
Assuming that the population is in Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium with respect to blood type, 
what is the frequency of the i allele? Give your 
answer to two decimal places.

124. Biological communities containing a large number of species 
that are evenly distributed exhibit high species diversity—a 
concept that encompasses both species richness (the number 
of different species present) and relative abundance  
(the number of individuals of each species). One measure of 
species diversity is Simpson’s index of diversity, which is 
represented by the following mathematical equation.
