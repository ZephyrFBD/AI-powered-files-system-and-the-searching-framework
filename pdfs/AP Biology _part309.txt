genes by tagging them with fluorescent dye.
However, until the 1940s, many scientists believed that proteins, not
DNA, were the molecules that make up genes and constitute inherited
material. Several factors contributed to that belief. First, proteins are a
major component of all cells. Second, they are complex macromolecules
that exist in seemingly limitless variety and have great specificity of
function. Third, a great deal was known about the structure of proteins and
very little was known about DNA. The work of many brilliant scientists
has transformed our knowledge of the structure and function of the DNA
molecule and led to the acceptance of DNA as the molecule responsible
for heredity.
This chapter covers the history of the search for the heritable material,
the structure of nucleic acids, and how DNA makes proteins. It also
includes an extensive review
