A holistic ecosystem model attempts to quantify the composition, interaction, and dynamics of entire ecosystems; it is the
most representative of the ecosystem in its natural state. A food web is an example of a holistic ecosystem model. However,
this type of study is limited by time and expense, as well as the fact that it is neither feasible nor ethical to do experiments
on large natural ecosystems. To quantify all different species in an ecosystem and the dynamics in their habitat is difficult,
especially when studying large habitats such as the Amazon Rainforest, which covers 1.4 billion acres (5.5 million km2) of
the Earthâ€™s surface.
For these reasons, scientists study ecosystems under more controlled conditions. Experimental systems usually involve
either partitioning a part of a natural ecosystem that can be used for experiments, termed a mesocosm, or by re-creating an
ecosystem entirely in an indoor or outdoor laboratory environment, which is referred to as a
