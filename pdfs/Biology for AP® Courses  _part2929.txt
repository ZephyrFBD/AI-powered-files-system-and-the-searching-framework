secreted from the (b) salivary glands. Enzymes in the saliva begin to digest starches and fats. With the help of the
tongue, the resulting bolus is moved into the esophagus by swallowing. (credit: modification of work by the National

Esophagus
The esophagus is a tubular organ that connects the mouth to the stomach. The chewed and softened food passes through the
esophagus after being swallowed. The smooth muscles of the esophagus undergo a series of wave like movements called
peristalsis that push the food toward the stomach, as illustrated in Figure 25.10. The peristalsis wave is unidirectionalâ€”it
moves food from the mouth to the stomach, and reverse movement is not possible. The peristaltic movement of the
esophagus is an involuntary reflex; it takes place in response to the act of swallowing.
Figure 25.10 The esophagus transfers food from the mouth to the stomach through peristaltic movements.
