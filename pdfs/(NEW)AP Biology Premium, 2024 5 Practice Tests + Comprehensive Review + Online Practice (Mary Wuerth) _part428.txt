n enzyme.
12. (a) The phosphates in the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA have a slight negative charge. They would be
attracted to a positively charged electrode.
(b) Any mutagen could damage DNA and result in longer tails. Some examples are ionizing radiation, UV light,
and carcinogens (all of which can cause breaks in the DNA sequence).
(c)
(d) Cell A has two functional p53 alleles and thus would have a greater capacity to repair the DNA damage.
Therefore, the tail in the comet assay would be shorter for cell A than the tail for cell B, which only has one
functional p53 allele.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) Restriction endonucleases would be used to cut the desired genes from their original plasmids, and DNA
ligase would be used to connect them together in a recombinant plasmid.
(b) The plate that acts as this control is plate #2, which contains both ampicillin and tetracycline. This plate
shows that the bacteria used in the transformation procedure were not originally resistant to the a
