The Central Vacuole
Previously, we mentioned vacuoles as essential components of plant cells. If you look at Figure 4.8b, you will see that plant
cells each have a large central vacuole that occupies most of the area of the cell. The central vacuole plays a key role in
regulating the cell’s concentration of water in changing environmental conditions. Have you ever noticed that if you forget
to water a plant for a few days, it wilts? That’s because as the water concentration in the soil becomes lower than the water
concentration in the plant, water moves out of the central vacuoles and
