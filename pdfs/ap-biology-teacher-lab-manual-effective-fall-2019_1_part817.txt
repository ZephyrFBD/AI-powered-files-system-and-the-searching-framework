p = pressure potential

s = solute potential 
The water potential will be equal to 
the solute potential of a solution in an 
open container because the pressure 
potential of the solution in an open 
container is zero.

s = – iCRT 
i = ionization constant (1.0 for sucrose 
 
because sucrose does not ionize in 
water) 
C = molar concentration
