l use the word debase in this sense, meaning to lower the value of something.) 
When a base is added to an acid, the base “lowers” the amount of acid. Indeed, when 
acids and bases are mixed in the right proportions, their characteristic properties seem to 
disappear altogether. 
 (Section 4.3)
By 1830 it was evident that all acids contain hydrogen but not all hydrogen- 
containing substances are acids. During the 1880s, the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhe-
nius (1859–1927) defined acids as substances that produce H+ ions in water and bases as 
substances that produce OH - ions in water. Over time the Arrhenius concept of acids 
and bases came to be stated in the following way:
t An acid is a substance that, when dissolved in water, increases the concentration of 
H + ions.
t A base is a substance that, when dissolved in water, increases the concentration of 
OH -  ions.
Hydrogen chloride gas, which is highly soluble in water, is an example of an Arrhe-
nius acid. When it dissolves in w
