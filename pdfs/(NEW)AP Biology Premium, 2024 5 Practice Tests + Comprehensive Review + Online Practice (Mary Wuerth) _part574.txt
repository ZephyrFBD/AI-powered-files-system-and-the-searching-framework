Lab 1: Artificial Selection
One of the key driving forces in evolution is selection. Natural selection is the process by which organisms that are
better adapted to their environment survive and reproduce at a greater rate. In artificial selection, humans choose
organisms with desirable traits, and only these organisms are allowed to survive and reproduce.
While many different organisms can be used to study artificial selection, Fast Plants (Brassica rapa) are an ideal
model organism for studying evolution in the classroom because they are easy to grow and have a short generation
