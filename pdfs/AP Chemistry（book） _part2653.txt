 16.76  Use the acid-dissociation constants in Table 16.3 to ar-
range these oxyanions from strongest base to weakest: 
SO4

2-, SO3
2-, and PO4
3-.
 16.77 (a) Given that Ka for acetic acid is 1.8 * 10-5 and that for 
hypochlorous acid is 3.0 * 10-8, which is the stronger acid?  
(b) Which is the stronger base, the acetate ion or the hypo-
chlorite ion? (c) Calculate Kb values for CH3COO- and ClO-.
 16.50  Write the chemical equation and the Ka expression for the 
acid dissociation of each of the following acids in aqueous 
solution. First show the reaction with H+1aq2 as a prod-
