not transferred, (D). (A) is incorrect because only a small minority of
the energy is transferred between levels. (B) is incorrect because about
99% of energy is lost between producers and primary consumers, but
only about 90% between primary and secondary consumers. (C) is
incorrect because energy does not cycle through the various levels;
rather, it flows from the lowest levels to the highest, with most energy
being lost with each transfer.

The reaction occurring in organelle A is photosynthesis, as indicated by
the splitting of water and fixation of CO2. The first reaction in this
organelle represents the light reactions, in which the Sunâ€™s energy is
converted to chemical energy in the form of ATP, labeled E II in the
diagram. (C) is thus correct. (A) corresponds to E I and (B) corresponds
to E III. (D) is not represented in the figure because glycolysis occurs in
the cytoplasm, not within an organelle.

The reaction occurring in organelle B is cellular respiration, as
in
