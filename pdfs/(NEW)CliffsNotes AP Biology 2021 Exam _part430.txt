 processes that are believed to
have contributed to the formation of the first living things. The steps
hypothesized to have led to the first primitive cell and the subsequent steps
that led to more complex living cells are outlined below with supporting
information:
1. The earth and its atmosphere formed 4.6 bya.
 
There is considerable geologic evidence that the earth formed 4.6 billion years ago (bya). The earth remained
inhospitable to life for billions of years.
The primordial atmosphere originated from outgassing of the molten interior of the planet (through volcanos) and
consisted
 
primarily of CO2 and N2, but little or no O2.
 
2. The primordial seas formed.
 As the earth cooled, gases condensed to produce primordial seas consisting of water and minerals.
 
3. Organic molecules were synthesized.
 
Energy catalyzed the formation of organic molecules from inorganic molecules. An organic “soup” formed.
Energy was provided mostly by ultraviolet light (UV), but also lightning, radi
