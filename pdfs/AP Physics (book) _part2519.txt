he mirror surface curves away
from the viewer (like a “cave”), Fig. 23–10b. Concave mirrors are used as shaving
or cosmetic mirrors (magnifying mirrors), Fig. 23–11a, because they magnify.
Convex mirrors are sometimes used on cars and trucks (rearview mirrors) and in
shops (to watch for theft), because they take in a wide field of view, Fig. 23–11b.

includes a wide field of view.
