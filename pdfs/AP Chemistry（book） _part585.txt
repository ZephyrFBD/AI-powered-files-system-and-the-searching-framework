s) to form Fe3+.
The reaction between iron and oxygen tends to be relatively slow, but other metals, 
such as the alkali and alkaline earth metals, react quickly upon exposure to air. Figure 4.12 
shows how the bright metallic surface of calcium tarnishes as CaO forms in the reaction
 
2 Ca1s2 + O21g2 ยก 2 CaO1s2 
[4.22]
In this reaction, Ca is oxidized to Ca2+ and neutral O2 is transformed to O2- ions. In Equa-
tion 4.22, the oxidation involves transfer of electrons from the calcium metal to the O2, 
leading to formation of CaO. When an atom, ion, or molecule becomes more negatively 
charged (gains electrons), we say that it is reduced. The gain of electrons by a substance 
is called reduction. When one reactant loses electrons (that is, when it is oxidized), 
another reactant must gain them. In other words, oxidation of one substance must be 
accompanied by reduction of some other substance. In Equation 4.22, then, molecular 
oxygen is reduced to oxide (O2-) ions.
O2(g) is reduced
