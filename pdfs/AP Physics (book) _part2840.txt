fashion, Fig. 25–38, with atoms spaced a distance d apart. Suppose that a beam of
X-rays is incident on the crystal at an angle 
to the surface, and that the two rays
shown are reflected from two subsequent planes of atoms as shown. The two rays
will constructively interfere if the extra distance ray I travels is a whole number
of wavelengths farther than the distance ray II travels. This extra distance is
Therefore, constructive interference will occur when
(25;10)
where m can be any integer. (Notice that is not the angle with respect to the normal
to the surface.) This is called the Bragg equation after W. L. Bragg (1890–1971),
who derived it and who, together with his father, W. H. Bragg (1862–1942),
developed the theory and technique of X-ray diffraction by crystals in 1912–1913.
If the X-ray wavelength is known and the angle 
is measured, the distance d
between atoms can be obtained. This is the basis for X-ray crystallography.
