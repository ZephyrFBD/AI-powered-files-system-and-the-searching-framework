(c) How long was the first child in the air?
81. If there were no air resistance, how long would it take a
free-falling skydiver to fall from a plane at 3200 m to an
altitude of 450 m, where she will open her parachute? What
would her speed be at 450 m? (In reality, the air resis-
tance will restrict her speed to perhaps 
)
82. You stand at the top of a cliff while your friend stands on
the ground below you. You drop a ball from rest and see
that she catches it 1.4 s later. Your friend then throws the
ball up to you, such that it just comes to rest in your hand.
What is the speed with which your friend threw the ball?
150 kmh.

196.0 kmh,

83. On an audio compact disc (CD), digital bits of infor-
mation are encoded sequentially along a spiral path. Each
bit occupies about 
A CD player’s readout laser
scans along the spiral’s sequence of bits at a constant
speed of about 
as the CD spins. (a) Determine
the number N of digital bits that a CD player reads
