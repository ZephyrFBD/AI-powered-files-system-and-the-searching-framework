s a “one-way street.” For the creation of the water molecule
shown above, the chemical equation would be:
2H + O → H2 O
An example of a simple chemical reaction is the breaking down of hydrogen peroxide molecules, each of which consists
of two hydrogen atoms bonded to two oxygen atoms (H2O2). The reactant hydrogen peroxide is broken down into water,
containing one oxygen atom bound to two hydrogen atoms (H2O), and oxygen, which consists of two bonded oxygen atoms
(O2). In the equation below, the reaction includes two hydrogen peroxide molecules and two water molecules. This is an
example of a balanced chemical equation, wherein the number of atoms of each element is the same on each side of the
equation. According to the law of conservation of matter, the number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction should
be equal, such that no atoms are, under normal circumstances, created or destroyed.
2H2 O2  (hydrogen peroxide) → 2H2 O (water) + O2  (oxygen)
Even though all of the reactant
