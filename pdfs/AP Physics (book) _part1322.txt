FIGURE 12–20 Determination of
the frequency shift in the Doppler
effect (see text). The red dot is the
source.
In a time T (just defined), the first wave crest has moved a distance
where 
is the velocity of the sound wave in air (which is the same whether 
the source is moving or not). In this same time, the source has moved a distance
Then the distance between successive wave crests, which is the
wavelength 
the observer on the right will perceive, is
We subtract 
from both sides of this equation and find that the shift in wave-
length,
is
So the shift in wavelength is directly proportional to the source speed 
The
frequency 
that will be perceived by our stationary observer on the ground is
given by (Eq. 11–12)
