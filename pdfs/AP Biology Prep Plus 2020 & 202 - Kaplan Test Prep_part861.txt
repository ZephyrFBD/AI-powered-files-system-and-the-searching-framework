 pol for all RNA (sigma factor), –10 and –35
region of promoter
Euk — RNA pol I, II, and III (rRNA, mRNA, tRNA), transcription
factors
(b) Euk — Introns removed to form single gene, cap/poly A tail added 
Prok — many genes on one mRNA (operon/polycistronic), no
introns, cap, or tail
(c) Prok — cytoplasm, translation begins before transcription done
→ Christmas-tree structure
Euk — nucleus (rRNA in nucleolus), no translation until exits
For Section II, you’ll have 80 minutes (aȇer the reading period) to answer
six questions. That’s an average of 13.3 minutes per question, but you’ll
want to spend about 22 minutes each on the two long questions and
about 9 minutes each on the four short ones. Take the time to make your
answers as precise and detailed as possible while managing the allotted
time.
Important Distinctions
Each free-response question will, of course, be about a distinct topic.
However, this is not the only way in which these questions diﬀer from one
another. Each question wil
