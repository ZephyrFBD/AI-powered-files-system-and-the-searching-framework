ll swells, and the spaces
between the lipids and proteins become too large, the cell will break apart.
In contrast, when excessive amounts of water leave a red blood cell, the cell shrinks, or crenates. This has the effect of
concentrating the solutes left in the cell, making the cytosol denser and interfering with diffusion within the cell. The cell’s
ability to function will be compromised and may also result in the death of the cell.
Various living things have ways of controlling the effects of osmosis—a mechanism called osmoregulation. Some
organisms, such as plants, fungi, bacteria, and some protists, have cell walls that surround the plasma membrane and prevent
cell lysis in a hypotonic solution. The plasma membrane can only expand to the limit of the cell wall, so the cell will not
lyse. In fact, the cytoplasm in plants is always slightly hypertonic to the cellular environment, and water will always enter
a cell if water is available. This inflow of water produces turgor pressur
