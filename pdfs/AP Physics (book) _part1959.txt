ed in coulombs per second; this is given a special
name, the ampere (abbreviated amp or A), after the French physicist André Ampère
(1775–1836). Thus,
Smaller units of current are often used, such as
the milliampere  
and microampere  
A current can flow in a circuit only if there is a continuous conducting path.
We then have a complete circuit. If there is a break in the circuit, say, a cut wire,
we call it an open circuit and no current flows. In any single circuit, with only a single
path for current to follow such as in Fig. 18–6b, a steady current at any instant is the
same at one point (say, point A) as at any other point (such as B). This follows
from the conservation of electric charge: charge doesn’t disappear. A battery does
not create (or destroy) any net charge, nor does a lightbulb absorb or destroy charge.
