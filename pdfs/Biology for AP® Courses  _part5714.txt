 for [Electron] properties, like
electric charge, or spin, or lepton number, but the electron doesn’t care what we call it, the
properties are just numbers.
This is the illusory reality Gnostics were describing. This is the
simulation. The A, C, G, and T codes of DNA have a binary value –
A and C = 0 while G and T = 1. This has to be when the simulation is
digital and the body must be digital to interact with it. Recurring
mathematical sequences are encoded throughout reality and the
body. They include the Fibonacci sequence in which the two
previous numbers are added to get the next one, as in ... 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,
8, 13, 21, 34, 55, etc. The sequence is encoded in the human face and
body, proportions of animals, DNA, seed heads, pine cones, trees,
shells, spiral galaxies, hurricanes and the number of petals in a
ﬂower. The list goes on and on. There are fractal paĴerns – a ‘never-
ending paĴern that is inﬁnitely complex and self-similar across all
scales in the as above, so below, princ
