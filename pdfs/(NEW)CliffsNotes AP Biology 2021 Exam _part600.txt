he end of meiosis II, become four spermatids. Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules
provide nourishment to the spermatids as they specialize, or differentiate, into mature spermatozoa. The
spermatozoa complete their development in the epididymis, a coiled tube attached to each testis, where they are
stored until needed.
Hormonal Control of Human Reproduction
The human female reproductive cycle is characterized by events in the ovary (ovarian cycle) and the uterus
(menstrual cycle). The purposes of these cycles are to produce an egg and prepare the uterus for the implantation of
the egg, should it become fertilized. The activities of the ovary and the uterus are coordinated by negative and
positive feedback responses involving gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary, and the hormones estrogen
and progesterone from the follicle and corpus luteum. A description of the event
