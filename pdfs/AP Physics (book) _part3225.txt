–3). The chlorine atom acquires a net negative charge
as a result of the extra electron, whereas the sodium atom is left with a net positive
charge. The electrostatic attraction between these two charged atoms holds them
together. The resulting bond is called an ionic bond because it is created by the
attraction between the two ions (
and 
). But to understand the ionic bond,
we must understand why the extra electron from the sodium spends so much of
its time around the chlorine. After all, the chlorine atom is neutral; why should 
it attract another electron?
The answer lies in the probability distributions of the electrons in the two
neutral atoms. Sodium contains 11 electrons, 10 of which are in spherically sym-
metric closed shells (Fig. 29–4). The last electron spends most of its time beyond
these closed shells. Because the closed shells have a total charge of 
and the
nucleus has charge
