terval. For example, in one rotation both children rotate through the
same angle (
or 
radians). The two children have the same angular velocity.

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 8;3
The total linear acceleration of a point in the rotating object is the vector sum
of two components:
where the radial component,
is the radial or “centripetal” acceleration and 
its direction is toward the center of the point’s circular path; see Fig. 8–6. We saw
in Chapter 5 (Eq. 5–1) that a particle moving in a circle of radius r with linear
speed v has a radial acceleration
We can rewrite this in terms of 
using Eq. 8–4:
(8;6)
Thus the centripetal acceleration is greater the farther you are from the axis of
rotation: the children farthest out on a carousel feel the greatest acceleration.
Equations 8–1, 8–4, 8–5, and 8–6 relate the angular quantities describing the 
rotation of an object to the linear quantities for each point of a rotating object.
Table 8–1 summarizes these relationships.
