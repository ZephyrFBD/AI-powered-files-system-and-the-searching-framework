HYPOTHESIS TESTING
t-test and p-values
Many experiments involve comparing two datasets or two groups, and a t-test can be used to calculate whether the
means of two groups are significantly different from each other. This test is most often applied to datasets that are
normally distributed. A p-value equal to or below 0.05 is considered significant in most biology-related fields. T-test
calculations involve comparing each data point to the group’s mean and also take standard deviation and sample size
into consideration.
Understanding mathematically how p-values are calculated and t-tests are performed is not important here. Instead,
it’s important that you understand how these values are used to interpret data.
Let’s work through an example to demonstrate how common statistics are used in biological labs.
A researcher has sections of two different types of skin cancers from human patients. She stains them for the protein
CD31, which is a marker of endothelial cells. She then takes d
