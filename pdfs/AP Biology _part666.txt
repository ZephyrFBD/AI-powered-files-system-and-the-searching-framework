ave millions of microscopic, thin-walled, moist air sacs
called alveoli that maximize diffusion of respiratory gases.
The walls of arteries are made of thick, smooth muscle that can
withstand the tremendous pressure of the blood they carry away
from the heart. Veins, in contrast, have thin walls because they
carry blood back to the heart under low pressure. The walls that
make up capillaries are one cell thick so that respiratory gases can
diffuse through them readily to and from the surrounding tissue.
The left ventricle of the heart is the chamber that pumps blood
away from the heart and around the body under high pressure. It has
the thickest wall of any chamber.
Skeletal muscles are ideally suited to contract. They consist of actin
and myosin filaments that are organized so the filaments can slide
past each other rapidly.
The villi and microvilli expand the absorption function of the small
intestine by greatly increasing the surface area for the diffusion of
nutrients and waste.
