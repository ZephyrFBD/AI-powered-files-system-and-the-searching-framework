yotic nucleus resulted from the fusion of archaeal and bacterial genomes,
and that (b) Gram-negative bacteria, which have two membranes, resulted from the fusion of Archaea and Gram-
positive bacteria, each of which has a single membrane.
The nucleus-first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first (Figure 20.16a), followed by a later
fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria. The mitochondria-first hypothesis proposes that
mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host (Figure 20.16b), which subsequently acquired a nucleus, by fusion
or other mechanisms, to become the first eukaryotic cell. Most interestingly, the eukaryote-first hypothesis proposes that
prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity (Figure 20.16c). All of these hypotheses are
testable. Only time and more experimentation will determine which hypothesis is best supported by data.
