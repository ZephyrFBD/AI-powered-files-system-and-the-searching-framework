onomer are combined. The reverse process is
3.4 Diﬀerentiate between common monomers and polymers
3.5 Determine how structure aﬀects properties of polymers
hydrolysis. Hydrolysis reactions use water to break down polymers and
release energy—one monomer gains a hydrogen atom and the other
monomer gains a hydroxyl group.
CARBOHYDRATES
Carbohydrates are a source of immediate energy in living systems and
serve as structural components. The three primary classes of
carbohydrates are monosaccharides, disaccharides, and
polysaccharides.
Monosaccharides are simple sugars that have the formula (CH2O)n,
where n represents the number of carbons in the backbone and ranges
from three to seven. Monosaccharides are classified based on the
number of carbon atoms (triose, tetrose, pentose, hexose, or heptose), as
well as on the position of their carbonyl group (an oxygen double-bonded
to a carbon). A monosaccharide with an aldehyde group (carbonyl group
at the end of the carbon chain) is an aldose, and
