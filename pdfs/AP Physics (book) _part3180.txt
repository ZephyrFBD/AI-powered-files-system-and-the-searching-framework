om in the excited state,
it stimulates this atom to emit a photon of the same frequency, moving in the same
direction, and in phase with it. These two photons then move on to strike other
atoms causing more stimulated emission. As the process continues, the number of
photons multiplies. When the photons strike the end mirrors, most are reflected
back, and as they move in the opposite direction, they continue to stimulate more
atoms to emit photons. As the photons move back and forth between the mirrors,
a small percentage passes through the partially transparent mirror at one end.
These photons make up the narrow coherent external laser beam. (Inside the
tube, some spontaneously emitted photons will be emitted at an angle to the axis,
and these will merely go out the side of the tube and not affect the narrow width
of the main beam.)

†An excited atom may land in such a state and can jump to a lower state only by a so-called forbidden
transition (Section 28–6),
