ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY
Third Line of Defense
The adaptive third line of defense relies on B lymphocytes and T
lymphocytes, which arise from stem cells in bone marrow. Once mature,
both cell types circulate in the blood, lymph, and lymphatic tissue (spleen,
lymph nodes, tonsils, and adenoids). Both cell types recognize different
specific antigens.*
The adaptive immune response is a specific response and involves three
phases:
RECOGNITION: Antigen receptors on B and T lymphocytes
recognize specific antigens or epitopes by binding to them.
Antigens are any substance that elicits an immune response from B
cells or T cells. Epitopes are an accessible piece of an antigen that
elicits an immune response from a B or T cell. Each B cell or T cell
displays specificity for one particular epitope. In order to recognize
an antigen, it must be presented to a B or T cell by an antigen-
presenting cell.
ACTIVATION PHASE: The binding of an antigen receptor activates B
