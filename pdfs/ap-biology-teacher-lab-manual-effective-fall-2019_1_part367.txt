 the leaf disks to sink in the 
experimental solution. If the solution has bicarbonate ions and enough light, the leaf 
disk will begin to produce sugars and oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. 
Oxygen collects in the leaf as photosynthesis progresses, causing the leaf disks to float 
again. The length of time it takes for leaf disks to float again is a measure of the net rate 
of photosynthesis. This process is shown in Figure 3.

Question: If the leaf disks are treated in a way you know increases the net rate of 
photosynthesis, should they start to float faster or slower? Why?
Step 1 Prepare 300 mL of 0.2% bicarbonate solution for each experiment. The bicarbonate 
will serve as a source of carbon dioxide for the leaf disks while they are in the solution.
Step 2 Pour the bicarbonate solution into a clear plastic cup to a depth of about 3 cm.
