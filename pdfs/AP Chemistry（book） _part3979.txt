2.88 (a) 2 protons, 1 neutron, 2 electrons (b) tritium, 3H, is more mas-
sive. (c) A precision of 1 * 10-27 g would be required to differentiate 
between 3H+ and 3He+. 2.90 Arrangement A, 4.1 * 1014 atoms>cm2
(b) Arrangement B, 4.7 * 1014 atoms>cm2 (c) The ratio of atoms 
going from arrangement B to arrangement A is 1.2 to 1. In three 
dimensions, arrangement B leads to a greater density for Rb metal.
