uble-stranded DNA are antiparallel in directionality.
3. The following figure shows the complementarity of DNA and RNA:
B. The functions of RNA and DNA are different.
1. DNA stores genetic information on how to make RNA and proteins, and it passes this information
from cell to cell and from parents to offspring.
2. Different types of RNA function in different ways.
i.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) transfers genetic information from DNA in the nucleus to ribosomes in
the cytoplasm, where its information is translated into proteins.
ii. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is incorporated into large complexes called ribosomes, which are the sites
of protein synthesis in the cytoplasm; rRNA also regulates gene expression at the level of mRNA
transcription.
iii. Transfer RNA (tRNA) carries amino acids to a ribosome so they can be assembled into proteins.
3. The three types of RNA have different structures and functions, but all are made during the process of
transcription, and all are important in the subsequent p
