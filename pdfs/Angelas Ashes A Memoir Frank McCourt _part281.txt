r. No one talks to Uncle Tom’s wife, Jane, because she’s from 
 
 Galway and she has the look of a Spaniard. Everyone talks to Mam’s 
 
 brother Uncle Pat, because he was dropped on his head, he’s simple,and 
 
 he sells newspapers. Everyone calls him The Abbot or Ab Sheehan and 
 
 no one knows why.Everyone talks to Uncle Pa Keating because he was 
 
 gassed in the war and married Aunt Aggie and if they didn’t talk to him 
 
  
  
 he wouldn’t give a fiddler’s fart anyway and that’s why the men in 
 
 South’s pub call him a gas man. 
 
 That’s the way I’d like to be in the world, a gas man, not giving 
 
 a fiddler’s fart, and that’s what I tell the Angel on the Seventh Step 
 
 till I remember you’re not supposed to say fart in the presence of an 
 
 angel. 
 
 Uncle Tom and Galway Jane have children but we’re not supposed 
 
 to talk to them because our parents are not talking.They have a son and 
 
 daughter,Gerry and Peggy, and Mam will yell at us for talking to them 
 
 but we do
