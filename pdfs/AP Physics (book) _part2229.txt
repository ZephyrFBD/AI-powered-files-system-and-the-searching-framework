the field inside the solenoid, and is the length cd. We set 
equal to 
times the current enclosed by our chosen rectangular loop: if a current I flows
in the wire of the solenoid, the total current enclosed by our path abcd is NI,
where N is the number of loops (or turns) our path encircles (five in Fig. 20–33).
Thus Ampère’s law gives us
so
(20;8 again)
as we quoted in the previous Section. This is the magnetic field magnitude inside
a solenoid. B depends only on the number of loops per unit length,
and the
current I. The field does not depend on the position within the solenoid, so B is
uniform inside the solenoid. This is strictly true only for an infinite solenoid, but
it is a good approximation for real ones at points not close to the ends.
The direction of the magnetic field inside the solenoid is found by applying
right-hand-rule-1, Fig. 20–8d (see also Figs. 20–9 and 20–10), and is as shown in
Fig. 20–33.
