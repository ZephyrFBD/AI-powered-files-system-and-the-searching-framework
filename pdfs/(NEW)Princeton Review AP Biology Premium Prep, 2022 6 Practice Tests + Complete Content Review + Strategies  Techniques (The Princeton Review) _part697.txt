levels: 50–60% and 5–10%.
(a) Soil moisture and temperature are important for plant survival. Explain how plants react to environmental
stimuli to maintain homeostasis.
(b) Explain how harsh environmental condition can change the phenotypes of a population over many
generations.
(c) Predict what might have led to the change in water preference for the sunflower population.
(d) Justify your prediction.
5. The pedigree shown in Figure 1, numbered by individual, tracks the instances of color blindness within the
family. Squares are male, circles are female, and each half of a shape represents one of the two copies of the
gene. Shading represents that the allele for color blindness is present.

(a) Explain the importance of diploid and haploid cells in sexual reproduction.
(b) Explain what the genotype of an individual with no shading would be. If you use abbreviations, be sure to
indicate what they represent.
(c)
