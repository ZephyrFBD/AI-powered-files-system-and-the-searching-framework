en the plane of
polarization is parallel to the Polaroid’s transmission axis, and a minimum when
perpendicular to it. If you do this while looking at the sky, preferably at right
angles to the Sun’s direction, you will see that skylight is polarized. (Direct sunlight
is unpolarized, but don’t look directly at the Sun, even through a polarizer, for
damage to the eye may occur.) If the light transmitted by an analyzer Polaroid
falls to zero at one orientation, then the light is 100% plane-polarized. If it merely
reaches a minimum, the light is partially polarized.
Unpolarized light consists of light with random directions of polarization.
Each of these polarization directions can be resolved into components along two
mutually perpendicular directions. On average, an unpolarized beam can be
thought of as two plane-polarized beams of equal magnitude perpendicular to
one another. When unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, one component
is eliminated. So the intensity of the light pa
