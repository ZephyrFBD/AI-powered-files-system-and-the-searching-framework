es of the elements, but sometimes they are derived from a foreign name 
instead (last column in Table 1.1). You will need to know these symbols and learn 
others as we encounter them in the text.
All of the known elements and their symbols are listed on the front 
inside cover of this text in a table known as the periodic table. In the peri-
odic table, the elements are arranged in columns so that closely related ele-
ments are grouped together. We describe the periodic table in more detail in 
(c) Molecules
      of a compound
(b) Molecules
      of an element
(a) Atoms of an element
(d) Mixture of elements
      and a compound
Elements are composed
of only one kind of atom.
Compounds must have at
least two kinds of atoms.
