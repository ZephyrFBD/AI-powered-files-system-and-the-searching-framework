research in the development of therapeutic drugs or
industrial applications. Why do you think this is so?
a.
Extremophiles can be altered genetically in vitro
to allow them to live in extreme conditions and
this capability of alteration can be used to help
humans. For example, some water-resistant
prokaryotes have developed DNA repair
mechanisms. Also, they could be developed and
used in the treatment of human disease.
b.
Extremophiles have specialized adaptations that
allow them to live in extreme conditions. These
adaptations can be mobilized to help humans.
For example, some water-resistant prokaryotes
have developed DNA repair mechanisms. Also,
they could be developed and used in the
treatment of human disease.
c.
Extremophiles can be altered genetically in vitro
to allow them to live in extreme conditions and
this capability of alteration can be used to help
humans. For example, some radiation-resistant
prokaryotes have developed DNA repair
mechanisms. Also, they could be develope
