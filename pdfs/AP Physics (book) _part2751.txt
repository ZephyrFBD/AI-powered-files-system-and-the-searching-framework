oming from beneath the sur-
face? Compare to the angle for total internal reflection, and
to Brewster’s angle from above the surface.
70. (II) Unpolarized light of intensity 
passes through six
successive Polaroid sheets each of whose axis makes a 35°
angle with the previous one. What is the intensity of the
transmitted beam?
71. (III) Two polarizers are oriented at 48° to each other and
plane-polarized light is incident on them. If only 35% of
the light gets through both of them, what was the initial
polarization direction of the incident light?
72. (III) Four polarizers are placed in succession with their axes
vertical, at 30.0° to the vertical, at 60.0° to the vertical, and
at 90.0° to the vertical. (a) Calculate what fraction of the
incident unpolarized light is transmitted by the four 
polarizers. (b) Can the transmitted light be decreased by
removing one of the polarizers? If so, which one? (c) Can
the transmitted light intensity be extinguished by removing
polarizers? If so, whi
