10.2 ▶  Pressure Describe gas pressure, the units 
used to express it, and consider Earth’s 
atmosphere and the pressure it exerts.
 
10.3 ▶  The Gas Laws Express the state of 
a gas in terms of its volume, pressure, 
temperature, and quantity and examine 
several gas laws, which are empirical 
relationships among these four variables.
 
10.4 ▶  The Ideal-Gas Equation Examine 
and use the ideal-gas equation, PV = nRT. 
Although this equation is not obeyed exactly 
by any real gas, most gases come very close 
to obeying it at ordinary temperatures and 
pressures.
 
10.5 ▶  Further Applications of the 
Ideal-Gas Equation Use the ideal-gas 
equation in additional calculations, such as 
the calculation of the density or molar mass 
of a gas.
 
10.6 ▶  Gas Mixtures and Partial 
Pressures Recognize and utilize the fact 
that in a mixture of gases, each gas exerts 
a pressure that is part of the total pressure. 
This partial pressure is the pressure the gas 
would exert if it were b
