ategorized by chemical 
properties (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or 
ionic), and the interactions of these R groups 
determine structure and function of that 
region of the protein. 
c.	Complex carbohydrates comprise sugar 
monomers whose structures determine the 
properties and functions of the molecules.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
d.	Lipids are nonpolar macromolecules—
 i.	 Differences in saturation determine the 
structure and function of lipids. 
ii.	 Phospholipids contain polar regions that 
interact with other polar molecules, such 
as water, and with nonpolar regions that 
are often hydrophobic.
