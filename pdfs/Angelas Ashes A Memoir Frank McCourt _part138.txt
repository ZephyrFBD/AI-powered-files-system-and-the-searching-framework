 bless you, ma’am, and her eyes are watery. 
 
 Dad is walking back and forth with Oliver in his arms and Eugene 
 
 is playing on the floor with a pot and a spoon. Dad says, Did you get 
 
 the onion? 
 
 I did, says Mam, and more. I got coal and the way of lighting it. 
 
 I knew you would. I said a prayer to St. Jude. He’s my favorite saint, 
 
 patron of desperate cases. 
 
 I got the coal. I got the onion, no help from St. Jude. 
 
 Dad says,You shouldn’t be picking up coal off the road like a common 
 
 beggar. It isn’t right. Bad example for the boys. 
 
 Then you should have sent St. Jude down the Dock Road. 
 
 Malachy says, I’m hungry, and I’m hungry, too, but Mam says,Ye’ll 
 
 wait till Oliver has his onion boiled in milk. 
 
  
  
 She gets the fire going, cuts the onion in half, drops it in the boiling 
 
 milk with a little butter and sprinkles the milk with pepper. She 
 
 takes Oliver on her lap and tries to feed him but he turns away and 
 
 looks into the fire.
