▲ Figure 3.16 Procedure for calculating 
amounts of reactants consumed or products 
formed in a reaction. The number of grams 
of a reactant consumed or product formed 
can be calculated in three steps, starting 
with the number of grams of any reactant or 
product.

Many chemical reactions either consume or produce heat (Figure 3.8). This heat is 
also a stoichiometric quantity. For instance, if a given reaction of a given number of reac-
tant moles produces 100 J of energy in the form of heat, performing the reaction with 
twice the number of moles of reactants will produce 200 J of heat. We will explore these 
ideas further in Chapter 5.
