Throughout the AP Biology course, students will develop skills that are fundamental to the discipline of biology. 
Since these science practices represent the complex skills that adept biologists demonstrate, students will benefit 
from multiple opportunities to develop these skills in a scaffolded manner.
The science practices enable students to apply their content knowledge and establish lines of evidence, using them 
to develop and refine testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena. The science practices that follow 
capture important aspects of the work that scientists engage in, at the level of competence expected of AP Biology 
students. These practices are effectively integrated with the course content and can be paired with a variety of 
learning objectives. You are strongly encouraged to design instruction with these science practices in mind.
Science Practice 1: Explain biological concepts, processes, and 
models presented in written format.
