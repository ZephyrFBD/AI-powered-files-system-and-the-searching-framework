 the 100 g of solution.
solution. Let’s assume that there is exactly 100 g of solution. 
Because the solution is 36% HCl, it contains 36 g of HCl and 
1100 - 362 g = 64 g of H2O. We must convert grams of solute 
(HCl) to moles to calculate either mole fraction or molality. We 
must convert grams of solvent 1H2O2 to moles to calculate mole 
fractions and to kilograms to calculate molality.

A solution with a density of 0.876 g>mL contains 5.0 g of toluene 1C7H82 and 225 g of benzene. Calculate the molarity of the solution.
Solve 
The number of moles of solute is:
Analyze Our goal is to calculate the molarity of a solution, given 
the masses of solute 15.0 g2 and solvent 1225 g2 and the density of 
the solution 10.876 g>mL2.
Check The magnitude of our answer is reasonable. Round-
ing moles to 0.05 and liters to 0.25 gives a molarity of 
10.05 mol2>10.25 L2 = 0.2 M.
The units for our answer 1mol>L2 are correct, and the answer, 0.21,
