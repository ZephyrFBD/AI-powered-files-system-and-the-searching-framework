To maintain the security of the exam and the validity of my AP score, I will allow no one else to see the multiple-choice questions. I will seal the
multiple-choice booklet when asked to do so, and I will not discuss these questions with anyone at any time after completing the
section. I am aware of and agree to the AP Programâ€™s policies and procedures as outlined in the 2013-14 Bulletin for AP Students and Parents,
including using testing accommodations (e.g., extended time, computer, etc.) only if I have been preapproved by College Board Services 
for Students with Disabilities.
