e
or the penetration of anti-microbial compounds)
Bile, Host Defenses, Viruses
II.
Solutions:
Lipopolysaccharide(s) (LPS) attached to the outer
membrane of gram-negative (G–) bacteria; LPS
contains the O-antigen (outward-facing)
LPS repels fat-dissolving molecules such as bile, which
might damage the bacterial cell membrane
Changing the O-antigen (via mutation) protects against
host's defenses (e.g., antibodies, memory B-cells,
memory T-cells, plasma cells, etc.)
Changing the O-antigen protects against viruses that utilize
the O-antigen for bacterial cell recognition
Phagocytes, Antibodies, Viruses, Desiccation, Nutrient Deprivation, Waste Products
III:
Solutions:
Glycocalyx (capsule or slime layer)–any network of
polysaccharides or glycoproteins secreted outside of
the cell wall
Protects bacteria from being engulfed by host phagocytes
Protects bacteria from host antibodies
Protects bacteria against desiccation
Allows bacteria to form a spherical clump, protecting
bacteria in interior
