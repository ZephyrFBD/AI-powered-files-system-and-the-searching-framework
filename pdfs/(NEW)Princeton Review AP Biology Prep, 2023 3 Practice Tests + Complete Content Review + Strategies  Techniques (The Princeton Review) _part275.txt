cause they are what make a
cancer cell different from a normal cell.
Let’s recap:
The cell cycle consists of two things: interphase and mitosis.
During the S phase of interphase, the chromosomes replicate via DNA replication.
Growth and preparation for mitosis occur during the G1 and G2 stages of interphase.
Cell cycle checkpoints make sure the cell is ready to continue through the cell cycle.
CDK and cyclin proteins work together to promote cell cycle progression.
Oncogenes promote cell growth and tumor suppressor genes inhibit cell growth.
MITOSIS: THE DANCE OF THE CHROMOSOMES
Once the chromosomes have replicated, the cell is ready to begin mitosis—the period during which the cell divides
into two genetically identical daughter cells. Mitosis is important for growth, tissue repair, and asexual reproduction.
Mitosis consists of a sequence of four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. It is not important to
memorize the name of each phase, but it is important that you k
