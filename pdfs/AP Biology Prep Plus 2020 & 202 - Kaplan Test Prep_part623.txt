ociated with a reduced risk of malaria. The
figure shows G6PD enzyme activity in men and women by
genotype.
The researchers found that one copy of the mutant allele was
suﬀicient to reduce the risk of malaria in men but homozygosity of
the mutant allele was required to reduce the risk of malaria in
women. What is the most likely explanation for these results?

Answers to this quiz can be found at the end of this chapter.
Women possess two copies of the X chromosome, so both
copies must contain the recessive mutant allele to yield
resistance to malaria.
(A)
Gene expression is impacted by whether an individual is
likely to be aﬀected by malaria, meaning that individuals in
high-risk areas are more likely to have the mutant allele.
(B)
Hemizygous individuals have the greatest protection against
malaria b
