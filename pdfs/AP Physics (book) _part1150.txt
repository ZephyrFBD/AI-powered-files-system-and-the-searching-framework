 11–5a, c), all the energy is stored
in the spring as potential energy (and is the same whether the spring is com-
pressed or stretched to the full amplitude). At these extreme points, the mass stops
for an instant as it changes direction, so
and
(11;4a)
Thus, the total mechanical energy of a simple harmonic oscillator is proportional
to the square of the amplitude. At the equilibrium point,
(Fig. 11–5b), all
the energy is kinetic:
(11;4b)
where
is the maximum speed during the motion (which occurs at
). At
intermediate points (Fig. 11–5d), the energy is part kinetic and part potential;
because energy is conserved (we use Eqs. 11–3 and 11–4a),
(11;4c)
From this conservation of energy equation, we can obtain the velocity as a
function of position. Solving for 
we have
From Eqs. 11–4a and 11–4b, we have
so
or 
(11;5a)
Inserting this equation into the equation just above it and taking the square root,
we have
(11;5b)
This gives the velocity of the object at any position x. The object moves
