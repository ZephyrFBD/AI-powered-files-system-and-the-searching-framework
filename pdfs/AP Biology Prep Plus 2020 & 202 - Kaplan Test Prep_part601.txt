7. Gibberellins are a family of hormones that promote germination
in seeds. A number of gibberellin-dependent transcription factors
mediate the eﬀect of the hormone on the seeds. A student is
investigating the mechanism of gibberellin action on germination.
He sprayed seeds with the hormone gibberellin and noted
changes in the concentration of proteins and mRNA in the seeds.
He found a decrease in proteins that attach to gibberellin-
dependent transcription factors. This drop in protein
concentration preceded an increase in the transcription of
gibberellin-dependent mRNAs. Which of the following provides
the best interpretation of the student’s finding?
Gibberellins remove inhibitory proteins that prevent
transcription of gibberellin-dependent proteins.
(A)
Pre-existing proteins must be degraded to provide amino
acids for newly synthesized gibberellin-dependent proteins.
(B)
Gibberellin-dependent transcription
