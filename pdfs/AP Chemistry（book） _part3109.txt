ghest temperature shown. (a) What processes corre-
spond to the entropy increases along the vertical lines 
labeled 1 and 2? (b) Why is the entropy change for 2 
larger than that for 1? (c) If this substance is a perfect 
crystal at T = 0 K, what is the value of S at this tempera-
ture? [Section 19.3]

19.6  Isomers are molecules that have the same chemical formula 
but different arrangements of atoms, as shown here for 
two isomers of pentane, C5H12. (a) Do you expect a sig-
nificant difference in the enthalpy of combustion of the 
two isomers? Explain. (b) Which isomer do you expect 
to have the higher standard molar entropy? Explain.

atoms of A shown in red in the diagram and atoms of B 
shown in blue. (a) If Kc = 1, which box represents the sys-
tem at equilibrium? (b) If
