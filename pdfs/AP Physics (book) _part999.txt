w as shown in Fig. 9–74, what is the maximum
force 
that the biceps muscle exerts on the forearm?
Assume the forearm and hand have a total mass of 2.0 kg
with a CG that is 15 cm from the elbow, and that the biceps
muscle attaches 5.0 cm
from the elbow.

radius. The top is 4.5 m off center. Is the tower in stable equi-
librium? If so, how much farther can it lean before it becomes
unstable? Assume the tower is of uniform composition.

each brick overhanging the one below it, so that the top
brick extends as far as possible beyond the edge of the
table. (a) To achieve this, show that success
