n in Fig. 29–32c. (The variation in output shown
in Fig. 29–32c is called ripple voltage.)
Rectifier circuits are important because most line voltage in buildings is ac,
and most electronic devices require a dc voltage for their operation. Hence, diodes
are found in nearly all electronic devices including radios, TV sets, computers, and
chargers for cell phones and other devices.
Photovoltaic Cells
Solar cells, also called photovoltaic cells, are rather heavily doped pn junction
diodes used to convert sunlight into electric energy. Photons are absorbed, creating
electron–hole pairs if the photon energy is greater than the band gap energy,
(see Figs. 29–25c and 29–28). That is, the absorbed photon excites an electron
from the valence band up to the conduction band, leaving behind a hole in the
valence band. The created electrons and holes produce a current that, when 
connected to an external circuit, becomes a source of emf and power. A typical
silicon pn junction may produce about 0.6
