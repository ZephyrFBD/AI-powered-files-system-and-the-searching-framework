Crossing-over is the exchange of genetic material of homologous
chromosomes and occurs during meiosis I. It produces individual
chromosomes that combine genes inherited from two parents. In
humans, two or three crossover events occur per homologous pair.
The random fertilization of one ovum by one sperm out of
millions results in enormous variety among the offspring.

The more genetic variation in a population, the greater the capacity for change or
evolution and survival.
4. Outbreeding
Outbreeding is the mating of organisms within one species that are not
closely related. It is the opposite of inbreeding, the mating of closely
related individuals. Outbreeding maintains both variation within a species
and a strong gene pool. Inbreeding weakens the gene pool because if
organisms that are closely related interbreed, detrimental recessive traits
tend to appear in homozygous recessive individuals. Many mechanisms
have evolved to promote ou
