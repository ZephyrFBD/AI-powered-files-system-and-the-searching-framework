Question 1 
In an investigation of the effect of a particular insecticide on plant growth and development, 
researchers established 20 test plots containing mature Haplopappus squarrosus shrubs. H. squarrosus 
is pollinated by certain species of insects and is eaten by other species of insects. Ten test plots were 
sprayed with the water-soluble insecticide, and ten test plots were sprayed with water only. The 
researchers recorded the numbers of plants or plant parts at different life stages in each test plot. The 
results of the investigation are shown in the table.
