essentially zero and the mixture is always homogeneous. (b) To 
determine whether Faraday’s dispersion is a true solution or a colloid, 
shine a beam of light on it. If light is scattered, the dispersion is a col-
loid. 13.87 Choice (d), CH3(CH2)11COONa, is the best emulsifying 
agent. The long hydrocarbon chain will interact with the hydropho-
bic component, while the ionic end will interact with the hydrophilic 
component, as well as stabilize the colloid. 13.89 (a) No. The hydro-
phobic or hydrophilic nature of the protein will determine which elec-
trolyte at which concentration will be the most effective precipitating 
agent. (b) Stronger. If a protein has been “salted out”, protein-protein 
interactions are stronger than protein-solvent interactions and solid 
protein forms. (c) The ﬁrst hypothesis seems plausible, since ion-
dipole interactions among electrolytes and water molecules are stron-
ger than dipole-dipole and hydrogen bonding interactions between 
water and protein mo
