Introduction
The muscular and skeletal systems provide support to the body and allow for a wide range of movement. The bones of the
skeletal system protect the body’s internal organs and support the weight of the body. The muscles of the muscular system
contract and pull on the bones, allowing for movements as diverse as standing, walking, running, and grasping items.
Injury or disease affecting the musculoskeletal system can be very debilitating. In humans, the most common
musculoskeletal diseases worldwide are caused by malnutrition. Ailments that affect the joints are also widespread, such
as arthritis, which can make movement difficult and—in advanced cases—completely impair
