e food is due to the strong contractions produced by the stomach muscles. The process of emesis is regulated
by the medulla.
25.4 | Digestive System Regulation
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
How is neural regulation involved in the digestive processes?
•
How do hormones regulate digestion?
Connection for AP® Courses
The concepts presented in this module are not within the scope for AP® other than to note that the brain houses the control
center for the sensation of hunger and satiety (fullness). The functions of the digestive system are regulated through neural
and hormonal responses. In the chapter that discusses the endocrine system, we explore in detail the role of the endocrine
system in maintaining homeostasis, including the normal functioning of the digestive system.
