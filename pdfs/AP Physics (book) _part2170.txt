ance of an old radio tuner consists of four
plates connected together placed
alternately between four other plates,
also connected together (Fig.19–92).
Each plate is separated from its neigh-
bor by 1.6 mm of air. One set of plates
can move so that the area of overlap
of each plate varies from

1. Compare the formulas for resistors and for capacitors when
connected in series and in parallel by filling in the Table below.
Discuss and explain the differences. Consider the role of
voltage V.
4. A potentiometer is a device to precisely measure potential
differences or emf, using a null technique.
