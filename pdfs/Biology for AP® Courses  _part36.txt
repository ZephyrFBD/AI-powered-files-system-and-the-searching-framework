Errata
All OpenStax textbooks undergo a rigorous review process. However, like any professional-grade textbook, errors
sometimes occur. Since our books are web based, we can make updates periodically when deemed pedagogically necessary.
If you have a correction to suggest, submit it through the link on your book page on OpenStax.org. Subject matter experts
review all errata suggestions. OpenStax is committed to remaining transparent about all updates, so you will also find a list
of past errata changes on your book page on OpenStax.org.
