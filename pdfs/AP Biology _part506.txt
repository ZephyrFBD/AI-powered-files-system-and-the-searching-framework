re two related outcomes, besides extinction, if two
species inhabit the same niche and therefore compete for resources. One
of the species will evolve through natural selection to exploit different
resources. This is called resource partitioning. Another possible outcome
is what occurred on the Galapagos Islands. Finches evolved different
beak sizes through natural selection and were able to eat different kinds of
seeds and avoid competition. This divergence in body structure is called
character displacement.
2. Predation
Predation can refer to one animal eating another animal, or it can also
refer to animals eating plants. For their protection, animals and plants have
evolved defenses against predation.
Animals have evolved active defenses such as hiding, fleeing, or
defending themselves. These, however, can be very costly in terms of
energy. Animals have also evolved passive defenses such as cryptic
coloration or camouflage that make the prey difficult to spot. Here are
three example
