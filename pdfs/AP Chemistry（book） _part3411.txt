bomb used in war-
fare, the bomb, code-named “Little Boy,” that was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on 
August 6, 1945. The bomb contained about 64 kg of uranium-235, which had been 
separated from the nonfissionable uranium-238 primarily by gaseous diffusion of 
uranium hexafluoride, UF6.   
 (Section 10.8) To trigger the fission reaction, two 
subcritical masses of uranium-235 were slammed together using chemical explosives. 
The combined masses of the uranium formed a supercritical mass, which led to a 
rapid, uncontrolled chain reaction and, ultimately, a nuclear explosion. The energy 
released by the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was equivalent to that of 16,000 tons 
of TNT (it therefore is called a 16-kiloton bomb). Unfortunately, the basic design of a 
fission-based atomic bomb is quite simple, and the fissionable materials are poten-
tially available to any nation with a nuclear reactor. The combination of design sim-
plicity and materials availability has generated international con
