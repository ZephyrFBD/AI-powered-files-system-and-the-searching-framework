for the same trait are
called alleles. In classical (Mendelian) genetics, an individual
receives one allele from each parent. Individuals with matching
alleles are homozygous for that trait while those with diﬀerent
alleles are heterozygous. Usually, one version of the allele is
dominant (e.g., brown eye color) and the other is recessive
(e.g., blue eye color). Heterozygotes are “ruled” by the
dominant allele.

Geneticists perform test crosses to determine the genetic
makeup (genotype) of organisms displaying the dominant
phenotype. A Punnett square is used to illustrate a test cross.
Mendel’s Law of Segregation states that an individual’s alleles
separate during meiosis, and either may be passed on to the
oﬀspring. Mendel’s Law of Independent Assortment states that
inheritance of a particular allele for one trait does not aﬀect
inheritance of other traits.

Sex-linked genes in humans occur on the X or Y chromosome.
