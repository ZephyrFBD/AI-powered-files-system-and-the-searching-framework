Calculating Equilibrium Constants (section 15.5)
 15.31 Methanol 1CH3OH2 is produced commercially by the 
catalyzed reaction of carbon monoxide and hydrogen: 
CO1g2 + 2 H21g2 ∆ CH3OH1g2. An equilibrium mix-
ture in a 2.00-L vessel is found to contain 0.0406 mol 
CH3OH, 0.170 mol CO, and 0.302 mol H2 at 500 K. Calcu-
late Kc at this temperature.
 15.32 Gaseous hydrogen iodide is placed in a closed container 
at 425 °C, where it partially decomposes to hydrogen and 
iodine: 2 HI1g2 ∆ H21g2 + I21g2. At equilibrium it is 
found that 3HI4 = 3.53 * 10-3 M, 3H24 = 4.79 * 10-4 M, 
and 3I24 = 4.79 * 10-4 M. What is the value of Kc at this 
temperature?
 15.14 The equilibrium constant for the dissociation of molecu-
lar iodine, I21g2 ∆2 I1g2, at 800 K is Kc = 3.1 * 10-5.

elementary processes, which reaction has
