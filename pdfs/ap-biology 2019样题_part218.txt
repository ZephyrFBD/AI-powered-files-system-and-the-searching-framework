 and ecosystems will change based on those interactions. The more 
biodiversity present in a system, the more likely that system is to maintain its health and 
success in the face of disruption. Energy flows through systems; the rate of flow determines 
the success of the species within the systems. By this point in the curriculum, a student 
should be able to accurately determine what happens within biological systems when 
disruptions occur.

Bullet How does diversity 
among and between 
species in a biological 
system affect the 
evolution of species 
within the system?
BIG IDEA 2
Energetics ENE
Bullet How does the 
acquisition of energy 
relate to the health of 
a biological system?
Bullet How do communities 
and ecosystems 
change, for better 
or worse, due to 
biological disruption?

and Transmission  IST
Bullet How does a disruption 
of a biological system 
affect genetic 
information storage and 
transmission?
