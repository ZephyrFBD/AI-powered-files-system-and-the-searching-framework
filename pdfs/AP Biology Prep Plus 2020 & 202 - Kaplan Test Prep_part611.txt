stem as increasing juvenile hormone levels, so it is unlikely to act as a
hormone itself.

The question stem specifies that “bee morphology is driven by an
external chemical signal.” One possible source of this external
chemical signal could be the food that is fed to larvae; larvae fed
diﬀerent foods could develop diﬀerent body types. (B) is thus correct.
(A) is incorrect because the question stem specifies that the diﬀerences
in morphology are driven by an external chemical signal, not a
temperature diﬀerential. (C) is incorrect because it is highly unlikely
that random mutations could produce the consistent diﬀerences in
morphology between queens and workers. (D) is incorrect because the
question stem specifies an external chemical signal is responsible, not
a diﬀerence in the use of body parts.
