tic Ocean, the predominant primary 
producers are phytoplankton. Phytoplankton  
are consumed by zooplankton, which in turn are 
eaten by codfish. In years when there is more 
open water (less ice coverage), there are more 
zooplankton and fish than in years with less open 
water (more ice coverage). Based on the graph 
above, the difference is most likely because 
(A) when there is less open water, light is blocked 
from the zooplankton, so they cannot 
produce as much food for the fish 
(B) when there is more open water, the 
temperature is warmer, so the zooplankton 
and fish populations increase in size 
(C) the ice blocks the light, so in years with more 
ice coverage, there is less photosynthesis by 
the phytoplankton 
(D) the ice increases the light available for 
photosynthesis, so primary production 
increases and zooplankton populations 
increase in size
