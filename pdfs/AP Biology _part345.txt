The newest research reveals that
much of this nongene DNA gets transcribed into RNA and consists of
regulatory and repetitive sequences that alter the expression of genes.
A number of genetic disorders, including Huntington’s disease, are
caused by abnormally long stretches of tandem repeats (back-to-back
repetitive sequences) within affected genes. Many of these tandem repeats
make up the telomeres. Scientists have also identified certain noncoding
regions of DNA, polymorphic regions, that are highly variable from one
region to the next.
Short tandem repeats (STR) consist of units of 2–5 nucleotides. One
example is GTTAC. The number of repeats of a unit can vary from site to
site within a genome. There can be as many as several hundred thousand
repeats of the GTTAC or other STR at one site but only half that number
in another. Also, the STR at any one site in the genome varies from person
to person. This individual variation from one person to another enables
forensic scientists to cr
