 incorporation of P into Si. 
(Section 12.7)
double bond A covalent bond involving two electron pairs. 
(Section 8.3)
double helix The structure for DNA that involves the 
winding of two DNA polynucleotide chains together in a 
helical arrangement. The two strands of the double helix are 
complementary in that the organic bases on the two strands are 
paired for optimal hydrogen bond interaction. (Section 24.10)
dynamic equilibrium A state of balance in which opposing 
processes occur at the same rate. (Section 11.5)
effective nuclear charge The net positive charge experienced by 
an electron in a many-electron atom; this charge is not the full 
nuclear charge because there is some shielding of the nucleus by 
the other electrons in the atom. (Section 7.2)
effusion The escape of a gas through an orifice or hole. 
(Section 10.8)
elastomer A material that can undergo a substantial change in 
shape via stretching, bending, or compression and return to its 
original shape upon release of t
