species) present. Then, using the DNA to uncover
phylogenetic relationships, the team could identify whether a newly discovered plant was in this family and
assess its potential medicinal properties.
Figure 20.9 Dalbergia sissoo (D. sissoo) is in the Fabaceae, or legume family. Scientists found that D. sissoo
shares a DNA marker with species within the Fabaceae family that have antifungal properties. Subsequently, D.
sissoo was shown to have fungicidal activity, supporting the idea that DNA markers can be used to screen for
plants with potential medicinal properties.

Part b of the figure shows a hypothetical model of the evolution of the cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria,
which has a double membrane. If this hypothesis is true, what does it suggest about the evolution of mitochondria and
chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells and why?
a.
Chloroplasts and mitochondria did not come about through endosymbiosis with gram-negative bacteri
