tissues, sodium and chloride ions pass freely through open channels, whereas in other tissues a gate must be
opened to allow passage. An example of this occurs in the kidney, where both forms of channels are found in different
parts of the renal tubules. Cells involved in the transmission of electrical impulses, such as nerve and muscle cells, have

gated channels for sodium, potassium, and calcium in their membranes. Opening and closing of these channels changes
the relative concentrations on opposing sides of the membrane of these ions, resulting in the facilitation of electrical
transmission along membranes (in the case of nerve cells) or in muscle contraction (in the case of muscle cells).
Carrier Proteins
Another type of protein embedded in the plasma membrane is a carrier protein. This aptly named protein binds a substance
and, in doing so, triggers a change of its own shape, moving the bound molecule from the outside of t
