ns the concentration of S2 -1aq2 is higher than in acidic solutions. Under 
these conditions, the ion products for many of the more soluble sulﬁdes exceed their 
Ksp values and thus precipitation occurs. The metal ions precipitated at this stage 
 
are Al3 +1aq2, Cr3 +1aq2, Fe3 +1aq2, Zn2 +1aq2, Ni2 +1aq2, Co2 +1aq2, and Mn2 +1aq2. (The 
Al3 +1aq2, Fe3 +1aq2, and Cr3 +1aq2 ions do not form insoluble sulﬁdes; instead they pre-
cipitate as insoluble hydroxides, as Figure 17.23 shows.)
Group 4. Insoluble phosphates: At this point, the solution contains only metal ions 
from groups 1A and 2A of the periodic table. Adding 1NH422HPO4 to a basic solu-
tion precipitates the group 2A elements Mg2 +1aq2, Ca2 +1aq2, Sr2 +1aq2, and Ba2 +1aq2 
because these metals form insoluble phosphates.
Group 5. The alkali metal ions and NH4
+1aq2: The ions that remain after removing the 
insoluble phosphates are tested for individually. A ﬂame test can be used to determine 
the presence of K+1aq2, for example,
