o acid differences from the other species than does
species V, so species II is not the outgroup. Thus, choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because
species I has only four amino acid differences from species IV but eight amino acid differences from species III,
so species IV should share a more recent common ancestor with species I.
5. (D) Species V is the outgroup because it has the greatest number of amino acid differences from the other four
species.
6. (A) All living organisms perform glycolysis in their cytoplasm, indicating a common ancestor of all life-forms.
Choice (B) is incorrect because not all living organisms have membrane-bound organelles. Prokaryotes do not
have linear chromosomes or introns, so choices (C) and (D) are incorrect.
7. (A) Bird songs are an example of behavioral isolation. Choice (B) is incorrect because gametic isolation occurs
when gametes are incompatible and cannot form a zygote. Habitat isolation involves separation by area, so
choice (C)
