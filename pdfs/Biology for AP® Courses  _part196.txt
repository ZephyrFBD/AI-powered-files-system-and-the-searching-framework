nheit), the heat is able to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules, and the kinetic energy (motion)
between the water molecules allows them to escape from the liquid as a gas. Even when below its boiling point, water’s
individual molecules acquire enough energy from other water molecules such that some surface water molecules can escape
and vaporize: this process is known as evaporation.
The fact that hydrogen bonds need to be broken for water to evaporate means that a substantial amount of energy is used in
the process. As the water evaporates, energy is taken up by the process, cooling the environment where the evaporation is
taking place. In many living organisms, including in humans, the evaporation of sweat, which is 90 percent water, allows
the organism to cool so that homeostasis of body temperature can be maintained.
Water’s Solvent Properties
Since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges, ions and polar molecules can readily
