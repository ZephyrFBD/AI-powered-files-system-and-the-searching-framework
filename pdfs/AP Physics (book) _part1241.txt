at 
is the value of the effective spring constant of the water?
(b) A partially filled water bottle of mass 0.28 kg and almost
the same size and shape of the balsa block is tossed into
the water. At what frequency would you expect the bottle
to bob up and down? Assume SHM.
11. (II) At what displacement of a SHO is the energy half
kinetic and half potential?
12. (II) An object of unknown mass m is hung from a vertical
spring of unknown spring constant k, and the object is
observed to be at rest when the spring has stretched by
14 cm. The object is then given a slight push upward and
executes SHM. Determine the period T of this oscillation.
13. (II) A 1.65-kg mass stretches a vertical spring 0.215 m. If
the spring is stretched an additional 0.130 m and released,
how long does it take to reach the (new) equilibrium
position again?
14. (II) A 1.15-kg mass oscillates according to the equation
where x is in meters and in seconds.
Determine (a) the amplitude, (b) the frequency, (c) the
total
