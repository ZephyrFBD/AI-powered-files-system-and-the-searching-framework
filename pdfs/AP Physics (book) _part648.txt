ring stiffness con-
stant. Other potential energies include chemical, electrical, and
nuclear energy. The change in potential energy when an object
changes position is equal to the external work needed to take
the object from one position to the other.
Potential energy is associated only with conservative forces,
for which the work done by the force in moving an object from
one position to another depends only on the two positions and
not on the path taken. Nonconservative forces like friction are
differentâ€”work done by them does depend on the path taken
and potential energy cannot be defined for them.
The law of conservation of energy states that energy can
be transformed from one type to another, but the total energy
remains constant. It is valid even when friction is present,
because the heat generated can be considered a form of energy
transfer. When only conservative forces act, the total mechanical
energy is conserved:

When nonconservative forces such as friction act, then
