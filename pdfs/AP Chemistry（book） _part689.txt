are initially far apart. What happens to their electrostatic 
potential energy as they are brought closer together?

â–² Figure 5.2 Electrostatic potential energy. At finite separation distances the electrostatic 
potential energy, Eel, is positive for objects with like charges, and negative for objects 
that are oppositely charged. As the particles move farther apart, their electrostatic potential energy 
approaches zero.
