*62. (II) A mallet consists of a uniform cylindrical head of mass
2.30 kg and a diameter 0.0800 m mounted on a uniform
cylindrical handle of mass 0.500 kg and length 0.240 m, as
shown in Fig. 7–42. If this mallet is tossed, spinning, into
the air, how far above the bottom of the handle is the point
that will follow a parabolic trajectory?

initially at rest together in outer space. They then push each
other apart. How far apart are they when the lighter astronaut
has moved 12 m?
