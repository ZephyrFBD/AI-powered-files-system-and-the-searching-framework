▲ Figure 7.22 Placed in a flame, ions of each alkali metal emit light of a characteristic wavelength.
Give It Some Thought
Cesium tends to be the most reactive of the stable alkali metals (francium, Fr, is 
radioactive and has not been extensively studied). What atomic property of Cs is 
most responsible for its high reactivity?
Go Figure
If we had potassium vapor lamps, what color would they be?
3p
E
3s
Electrical energy used to 
excite the electron from 
the 3s to the 3p orbital
Yellow photon is emitted when 
the electron drops from the 3p 
to the 3s orbital.
▲ Figure 7.23 The characteristic yellow light in a sodium lamp results from excited electrons in the 
high-energy 3p orbital falling back to the lower-energy 3s orbital.
Write a balanced equation for the reaction of cesium metal with (a) Cl21g2, (b) H2O1l2, (c) H21g2.
