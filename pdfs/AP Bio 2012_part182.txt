on the plant population and prairie community and justify 
the predictions. However, justifications are more limited. 
For example, the student may describe how the population 
size decreased due to death of infected members, or that 
the herbivore population could decrease due to increased 
competition for resources. Similarly, the student may 
describe how unaffected plant species gain resources because 
the loss of infected plants leads to more available resources. 
(Part d) The student is able to predict two to three potential 
effects — both negative and positive — of long-term 
change due to a viral infection on the plant population and 
prairie community and justify those predictions. However, 
justifications are more limited. For example, the student  
may describe how plant species become locally extinct due 
to increased death rate attributed to infection. Similarly,  
the student could predict a change in allele frequency  
when naturally resistant phenotypes are selected f
