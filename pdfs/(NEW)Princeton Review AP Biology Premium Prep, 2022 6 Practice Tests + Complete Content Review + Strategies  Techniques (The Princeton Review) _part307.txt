R), the resulting progeny will be pink
(RW). In other words, neither color is dominant over the other.
Codominance: Sometimes you’ll see an equal expression of both alleles. For example, an individual can have
an AB blood type. In this case, each allele is equally expressed. That is, both the A allele and the B allele are
expressed (IAIB). That’s why the person is said to have AB blood. The expression of one allele does not prevent
the expression of the other.
Polygenic inheritance: In some cases, a trait results from the interaction of many genes. Each gene will have a
small effect on a particular trait. Height, skin color, and weight are all examples of polygenic traits.
Non-nuclear inheritance: Apart from the genetic material held in the nucleus, there is also genetic material in
the mitochondria. The mitochondria are always provided by the egg during sexual reproduction, so
mitochondrial inheritance is always through the maternal line, not the male line. In plants the mitochondria
