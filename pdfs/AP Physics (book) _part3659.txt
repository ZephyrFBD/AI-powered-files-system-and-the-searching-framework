ggs boson at rest
decays into two tau leptons, what is the kinetic energy of
each tau? Follow the analysis of Example 32–5. See
Table 32–2. (b) What are the signs of the electric charges
of the two tau leptons? (c) Could a Higgs boson decay into
two Z bosons (Table 32–2)?
5. (a) Show, by conserving momentum and energy, that it is
impossible for an isolated electron to radiate only a single
photon. (b) With this result in mind, how can you defend
the photon exchange diagram in Fig. 32–8?
