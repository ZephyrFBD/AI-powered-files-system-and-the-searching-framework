3H+4 is very small, as is often the case, it would be unim-
portant. That reasoning is quite incorrect! Remember that many chemical processes 
depend on the ratio of changes in concentration. For example, if a kinetic rate law is 
first order in 3H+4, doubling the H+ concentration doubles the rate even if the change 
is merely from 1 * 10-7 M to 2 * 10-7 M.

CHAPTER 16 Acid–Base Equilibria
many reactions involve proton transfers and have rates that depend on 3H+4. Because 
the speeds of these reactions are crucial, the pH of biological fluids must be maintained 
within narrow limits. For example, human blood has a normal pH range of 7.35 to 7.45. 
Illness and even death can result if the pH varies much from this narrow range.
pOh and Other “p” Scales
The negative logarithm is a convenient way of expressing the magnitudes of other small 
quantities. We use the convention that the negative logarithm of a quantity is labeled 
“p” (quantity). Th
