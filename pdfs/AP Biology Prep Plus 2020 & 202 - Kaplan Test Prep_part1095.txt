mount of protein X and protein Y was measured over
time and compared to that of a non-treated control. The results for protein X
levels are shown in the figure. Note: The asterisk indicates the time point at which
protein X and Y are added in the experiments. 
22. A point mutation is introduced into the structural gene that codes for
protein X in a special line of E. coli cells, resulting in a mutant version of
protein X that can no longer bind to its promoter. When Experiment 1 is
repeated with this special line of E. coli, the expected outcome would
most likely be:
A continuous increase in the amount of mutant protein X over time
(A)
No increase in the amount of mutant protein X
(B)
A continuous increase in wild-type protein X over time
(C)
An initial increase in mutant protein X that levels oﬀ over time
(D)
23. Based on the data, how could protein X and protein Y be regulating the X
operon?
Protein X induces a positive feedback loop on itself, while protein Y
inhibits transcription
