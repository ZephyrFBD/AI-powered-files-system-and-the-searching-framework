released, the “empty” energy carriers return to the light-dependent reaction to obtain more energy. Figure 8.7 illustrates the
components inside the chloroplast where the light-dependent and light-independent reactions take place.
Figure 8.7 Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: light dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. Light-dependent
reactions, which take place in the thylakoid membrane, use light energy to make ATP and NADPH. The Calvin cycle,
which takes place in the stroma, uses energy derived from these compounds to make GA3P from CO2.

Explain how the light reactions and light independent reactions (Calvin cycle) of photosynthesis are interdependent on
each other.
