c friction. If
the objects are at rest relative to each other, then 
is just 
large enough to hold them at rest and satisfies the inequality
where 
is the coefficient of static friction.
For solving problems involving the forces on one or more
objects, it is essential to draw a free-body diagram for each
object, showing all the forces acting on only that object.
Newton’s second law can be applied to the vector components
for each object.

Summary
1. Why does a child in a wagon seem to fall backward when
you give the wagon a sharp pull forward?
2. A box rests on the (frictionless) bed of a truck. The truck
driver starts the truck and accelerates forward. The box
immediately starts to slide toward the rear of the truck bed.
Discuss the motion of the box, in terms of Newton’s laws, as
seen (a) by Mary standing on the ground beside the truck,
and (b) by Chris who is riding on the truck (Fig.4–35).
