ity, including both full-length genomic RNA
and shorter viral mRNAs. Group V viruses contain ssRNA genomes with a negative polarity, meaning that their sequence
is complementary to the mRNA. As with Group IV viruses, dsRNA intermediates are used to make copies of the genome
and produce mRNA. In this case, the negative-stranded genome can be converted directly to mRNA. Additionally, full-
length positive RNA strands are made to serve as templates for the production of the negative-stranded genome. Group
VI viruses have diploid (two copies) ssRNA genomes that must be converted, using the enzyme reverse transcriptase, to
dsDNA; the dsDNA is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and inserted into the host genome. Then, mRNA can
be produced by transcription of the viral DNA that was integrated into the host genome. Group VII viruses have partial
dsDNA genomes and make ssRNA intermediates that act as mRNA, but are also converted back into dsDNA genomes by
reverse transcriptase, ne
