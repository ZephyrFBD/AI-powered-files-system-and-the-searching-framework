 transcription rate increases due to clogging
of the transcription factors.
33. The wnt transcription pathway is responsible for key
changes during animal development. Based on the
transcription pathway shown below. In this diagram,
arrows indicate the transformation of one substance into
another. Square lines, or the lines with no arrowheads,
indicate inhibition of the product below the line. Based on
this, how would increased wnt gene expression affect the
expression of Bar-1?

a.
RBPs can bind first to the RNA, thus preventing
the binding of miRNA, which degrades RNA.
b.
RBPs bind the miRNA, thereby protecting the
mRNA from degradation.
c.
RBPs methylate miRNA to inhibit its function
and thus stop mRNA degradation.
d.
RBPs direct miRNA degradation with the help
of a DICER protein complex.
