CHEMIOSMOSIS. This is the process by which ATP is formed during
the light reactions of photosynthesis. Protons that were released
from water during photolysis are pumped by the thylakoid
membrane from the stroma into the thylakoid space (lumen). ATP
is formed as these protons diffuse down the gradient from the
thylakoid space, through the ATP synthase channels, and into the
stroma. The ATP produced here provides the energy that powers
the Calvin cycle.
NADP becomes reduced when it picks up the two protons that were
released from water in P680. Newly formed NADPH carries
hydrogen to the Calvin cycle to make sugar in the light-independent
reactions.
PHOTOSYSTEM Iâ€”P700. Energy is absorbed by P700. Electrons from
the head of chlorophyll a become energized and are captured by a
primary electron receptor. This process is similar to the way it
happens in P680. One difference is that the electrons that escape
from chlorophyll a are replaced with electrons from photosystem II,
P680, inst
