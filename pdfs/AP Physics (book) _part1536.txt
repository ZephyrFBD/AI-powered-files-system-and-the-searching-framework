C
†For any algebraic equation
if you subtract B from both sides you get
or
Thus, if you move a term from one side of an equals sign to the other, the sign 
changes.
(± or –)
A - B = 0.
A - B = B - B = 0,
A = B,
4. If phase changes do or might occur, there may be
terms in the energy conservation equation of the form
where L is the latent heat. But before
applying energy conservation, determine (or estimate)
in which phase the final state will be, as we did in
Example 14–7 by calculating the different contrib-
uting values for heat Q.
5. Note that when the system reaches thermal equilibrium,
the final temperature of each substance will have the
same value. There is only one

1. Be sure you have sufficient information to apply energy
conservation. Ask yourself: is the system isolated (or
nearly so, enough to get a good estimate)? Do we know
or can we calculate all significant sources of en
