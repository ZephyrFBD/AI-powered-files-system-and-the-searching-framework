nose whether a person has
restrictive or obstructive lung disease. In restrictive lung disease, FVC is reduced but airways are not obstructed, so
the person is able to expel air reasonably fast. In obstructive lung disease, airway obstruction results in slow exhalation
as well as reduced FVC. Thus, the FEV1/FVC ratio is lower in persons with obstructive lung disease (less than 69
percent) than in persons with restrictive disease (88 to 90 percent).
Dead Space: V/Q Mismatch
Pulmonary circulation pressure is very low compared to that of the systemic circulation. It is also independent of cardiac
output. This is because of a phenomenon called recruitment, which is the process of opening airways that normally remain
closed when cardiac output increases. As cardiac output increases, the number of capillaries and arteries that are perfused
(filled with blood) increases. These capillaries and arteries are not always in use but are ready if needed. At times, however,
there is a mismatch betwee
