as
not legitimate. We cannot even view an electron as a localized object, much less
a spinning one. What is important is that the electron can have two different
states due to some intrinsic property that behaves like an angular momentum, and
we still call this property “spin.” The two possible values of

are often said to be “spin up” and “spin down,” referring to the two possible
directions of the spin angular momentum.
The possible values of the four quantum numbers for an electron in the
hydrogen atom are summarized in Table 28–1.
