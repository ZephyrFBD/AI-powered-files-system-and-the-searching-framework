ge acceleration
is the same for both cars. (b) Instantaneous acceleration is the slope of the tangent
to the 
vs. curve. For the first 4 s or so, the top curve (car A) is steeper than the
bottom curve, so car A has a greater acceleration during this interval. The
bottom curve is steeper during the last 6 s, so car B has the larger acceleration
for this period. (c) Except at
and
car A is always going 
faster than car B. Since it is going faster, it will go farther in the same time.

Slope and Acceleration
We can also draw a graph of the velocity,
vs. time, , as shown in Fig. 2–30. Then the
average acceleration over a time interval 
is represented by the slope
