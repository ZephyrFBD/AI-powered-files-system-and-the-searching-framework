 vector sum of the fields created
separately by 
and 
The field due to the negative charge 
points toward 
and the field due to the positive charge 
points away from 
Thus both
fields point to the left as shown in Fig. 16–27b, and we can add the magnitudes
of the two fields together algebraically, ignoring the signs of the charges. In (b) we
use Newton’s second law
to find the acceleration, where
SOLUTION (a) Each field is due to a point charge as given by Eq. 16–4,
The total field points to the left and has magnitude
(b) The electric field points to the left, so the electron will feel a force to the
right since it is negatively charged. Therefore the acceleration
(Newton’s
second law) will be to the right. The force on a charge q in an electric field E is
(Eq. 16–5). Hence the magnitude of the electron’s initial acceleration is
NOTE By considering the directions of each field (
and 
) before doing any
calculations, we made sure our calculation could be done simply and correctly.
