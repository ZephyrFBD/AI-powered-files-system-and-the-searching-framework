water through the process called bleaching. Animals whose source of food is coral reefs also decline in
numbers.
Estuaries: Where the Ocean Meets Fresh Water
Estuaries are biomes that occur where a source of fresh water, such as a river, meets the ocean. Therefore, both fresh water
and salt water are found in the same vicinity; mixing results in a diluted (brackish) saltwater. Estuaries form protected areas
where many of the young offspring of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish begin their lives. Salinity is a very important factor
that influences the organisms and the adaptations of the organisms found in estuaries. The salinity of estuaries varies and
is based on the rate of flow of its freshwater sources. Once or twice a day, high tides bring salt water into the estuary. Low
tides occurring at the same frequency reverse the current of salt water.
The short-term and rapid variation in salinity due to the mixing of fresh water and salt water is a difficult physiological
