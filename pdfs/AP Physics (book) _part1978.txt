Resistance thermometer. The variation in electrical resis-
tance with temperature can be used to make precise temperature measurements.
Platinum is commonly used since it is relatively free from corrosive effects and has
a high melting point. Suppose at 20.0°C the resistance of a platinum resistance
thermometer is 
When placed in a particular solution, the resistance is
What is the temperature of this solution?
APPROACH Since the resistance R is directly proportional to the resistivity 
we can combine Eq. 18–3 with Eq. 18–4 to find R as a function of temperature T,
and then solve that equation for T.
SOLUTION Equation 18–3 tells us 
so we multiply Eq. 18–4 by
to obtain 
Here 
is the resistance of the wire at 
We solve this
equation for T and find (see Table 18–1 for )
NOTE Resistance thermometers have the advantage that they can be used at
very high or low temperatures where gas or liquid thermometers would be useless.
