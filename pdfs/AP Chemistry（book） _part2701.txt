 log 10 = 1, buffers usually have a usable 
range within {1 pH unit of pKa (that is, a range of pH = pKa {1).

We obtain 3OH-4 from the given pH:
pOH = 14.00 - pH = 14.00 - 9.00 = 5.00
and so:
3OH-4 = 1.0 * 10-5 M
Because Kb is small and the common ion 3NH4
+4 is present, the 
equilibrium concentration of NH3 essentially equals its initial 
concentration:
3NH34 = 0.10 M
We now use the expression for Kb to calculate 3NH4
+4 :
3NH4
+4 = Kb
3NH34
3OH-4 = 11.8 * 10-52
10.102
11.0 * 10-52
= 0.18 M
Thus, for the solution to have pH = 9.00, 3NH4
+4 must equal 
0.18 M. The number of moles of NH4Cl needed to produce this 
concentration is given by the product of the volume of the solu-
tion and its molarity:
12.0 L210.18 mol NH4Cl>L2 = 0.36 mol NH4Cl
Comment Because NH4
+ and NH3 are a conjugate acid–base pair, we 
could use the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation (Equation 17.9) to 
solve this problem. To do so requires first using Equation 16.41 to 
calculate pKa for NH4
+ from the value of p
