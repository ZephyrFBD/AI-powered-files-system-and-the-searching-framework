 metal. Based on the standard reduction potential for Al3+, for 
example, we expect aluminum metal to be readily oxidized. The many aluminum soft-
drink and beer cans that litter the environment are ample evidence, however, that alu-
minum undergoes only very slow chemical corrosion. The exceptional stability of this 
active metal in air is due to the formation of a thin protective coat of oxide—a hydrated 
form of Al2O3—on the metal surface. The oxide coat is impermeable to O2 or H2O and so 
protects the underlying metal from further corrosion.
Magnesium metal is similarly protected, and some metal alloys, such as stainless 
steel, likewise form protective impervious oxide coats.
Corrosion of Iron (Rusting)
The rusting of iron is a familiar corrosion process that carries a significant economic 
impact. Up to 20% of the iron produced annually in the United States is used to replace 
iron objects that have been discarded because of rust damage.
Rusting of iron requires both oxygen and w
