 induce 
him to come, but he was really too ill to offer any effective resistance to Stroeve's entreaties and to 
my determination. We dressed him, while he feebly cursed us, got him downstairs, into a cab, and 
eventually to Stroeve's studio. He was so exhausted by the time we arrived that he allowed us to 
put him to bed without a word. He was ill for six weeks. At one time it looked as though he could 
not live more than a few hours, and I am convinced that it was only through the Dutchman's 
doggedness that he pulled through. I have never known a more difficult patient. It was not that he 
was exacting and querulous; on the contrary, he never complained, he asked for nothing, he was 
perfectly silent; but he seemed to resent the care that was taken of him; he received all inquiries 
about his feelings or his needs with a jibe, a sneer, or an oath. I found him detestable, and as soon 
as he was out of danger I had no hesitation in telling him so.
"Go to hell," he answered briefly.
