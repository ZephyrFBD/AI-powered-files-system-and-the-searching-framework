10. When a battery is connected to a capacitor, why do the 
two plates acquire charges of the same magnitude? Will
this be true if the two plates are different sizes or shapes?

11. A conducting sphere carries a charge Q and a second iden-
tical conducting sphere is neutral.The two are initially isolated,
but then they are placed in contact. (a) What can you say
about the potential of each when they are in contact? (b) Will
charge flow from one to the other? If so, how much?
12. The parallel plates of an isolated capacitor carry opposite
charges, Q. If the separation of the plates is
