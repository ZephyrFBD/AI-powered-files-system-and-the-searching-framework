Question 1 (cont’d.) 
 
1. (b) 
Maximum 4 points — Explain the contradiction 
 
 
 
Sources of difference in DNA fingerprint 
• 
Variation in non-coding material (introns, spacers, minisatellites, “junk,” transposable elements) 
• 
Point mutations, small deletions, SNPs (single NT polymorphisms) 
• 
Variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs/STRs) 
 
Recognition of differences 
• 
A small percentage difference of a very large genome results in a large number of nucleotide 
differences 
• 
PCR-based fingerprinting: differences found by where primers anneal 
• 
Variation in restriction enzyme cutting sites 
 
Similarities among proteins 
• 
Redundancy in the code for amino acids 
• 
Neutral/silent mutation does not alter the function of the protein 
 
Caution: No explanation points in (a) without an attempted description of procedure 
 
Order of procedure points is not important if the
