When the phenotype associated with two traits is mixed, this is considered an example of incomplete
dominance. In this case, neither red nor blue is dominant, and the resulting progeny exhibited a mixture of
the traits (purple).

Crossing the pea plant that is heterozygous for both traits (TtGg) with a plant that is recessive for both
traits (ttgg) results in the following possible combinations, each of which should occur 25 percent of the
time: TtGg (tall and green), Ttgg (tall and yellow), ttGg (short and green), and ttgg (short and yellow).
Using the rules of probability, there is a 1/2 likelihood of it being tall and also a 1/2 likelihood of it being
yellow. Multiply them together to get 1/4.

Because the woman is a carrier, she must have one normal copy of the X chromosome and one diseased
copy. Since the boy will receive an X chromosome from his mother, there is a 50 percent chance that he
will receive a diseased copy. Because he doesnâ€™t have
