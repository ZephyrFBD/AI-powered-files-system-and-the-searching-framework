he pension. 
 
 Is it coddin’ me you are? Do you hear what I said, Frankie? Pension 
 
 my arse. If you pass the exam you’ll stay in the post office nice and 
 
 secure the rest of your life.You’ll marry a Brigid and have five little 
 
 Catholics and grow little roses in your garden.You’ll be dead in your 
 
 head before you’re thirty and dried in your ballocks the year before. 
 
 Make up your own bloody mind and to hell with the safeshots and the 
 
 begrudgers. Do you hear me, Frankie McCourt? 
 
 I do, Uncle Pa.That’s what Mr. O’Halloran said. 
 
  
  
 What did he say? 
 
 Make up your own mind. 
 
 True for Mr. O’Halloran. ’Tis your life, make your own decisions 
 
 and to hell with the begrudgers, Frankie. In the heel o’ the hunt you’ll 
 
 be going to America anyway,won’t you? 
 
 I will, Uncle Pa. 
 
 The day of the exam I’m excused from work.There’s a sign in an 
 
 office window on O’Connell Street, smart boy wanted, neat handwriting, 
 
 good at sums, apply here to manager
