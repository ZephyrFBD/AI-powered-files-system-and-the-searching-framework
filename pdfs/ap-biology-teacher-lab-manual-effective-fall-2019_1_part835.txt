 III differs from Processes I and II in that the progress curve for 
III is not a perfectly straight line. It is steepest at the beginning, becomes less steep after 
1 hour, and again after 3 hours. Obviously, because the rate of the process is changing 
with time, the corresponding rate curve will not be perfectly flat. The rate has to start 
out high, then drop at 1 hour and at 3 hours, and you can see in the graph on the right 
A12  Appendix B 
 
that this is exactly what it does. In fact, the rate curve looks like steps because whenever 
the slope of the progress curve decreases, the rate curve must show a drop to a lower 
value. Conversely, if the progress curve for a process should get steeper, as sometimes 
happens (the reaction goes faster after it gets “warmed up”), the rate curve must show a 
corresponding increase to a higher value. 
Until now we have been able to read the steepness, or slope, of the progress curve 
directly from the scales of the graph because the progress
