CHAPTER 16 Acid–Base Equilibria
Phosphorous acid 1H3PO32 has the Lewis structure shown at right.
(a) Explain why H3PO3 is diprotic and not triprotic. (b) A 25.0-mL sample of an H3PO3 solution titrated 
with 0.102 M NaOH requires 23.3 mL of NaOH to neutralize both acidic protons. What is the molarity 
of the H3PO3 solution? (c) The original solution from part (b) has a pH of 1.59. Calculate the percent 
ionization and Ka1 for H3PO3, assuming that Ka1 W Ka2. (d) How does the osmotic pressure of a  
0.050 M solution of HCl compare qualitatively with that of a 0.050 M solution of H3PO3? Explain.
(a) Acids have polar H ¬X bonds. From Figure 8.8 (p. 310) we see 
that the electronegativity of H is 2.1 and that of P is also 2.1. 
Because the two elements have the same electronegativity, the 
H ¬P bond is nonpolar. 
 (Section 8.4) Thus, this H cannot 
be acidic. The other two H atoms, however, are bonded to O, 
which has an electronegativity of 3.5. The H ¬O bonds are, 
therefore, polar w
