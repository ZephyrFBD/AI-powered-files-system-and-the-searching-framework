ced equation page 104 To obey the law of conserva-
tion of mass the mass of the products consumed must equal the 
mass of reactants formed, therefore the mass of H2O produced is 
1.00 g + 3.59 g - 3.03 g = 1.56 g H2O.

bases and Al1OH23 is insoluble. page 136 SO21g2 page 139  
(a) -3, (b) +5 page 142 (a) Yes, nickel is below zinc in the activity 
series so Ni2+1aq2 will oxidize Zns to form Nis and Zn2+1aq2.  
(b) No reaction will occur because the Zn2+1aq2 ions cannot be fur-
ther oxidized. page 147 The concentration is halved to 0.25 M.
