If the gas molecules contain more than one atom, then the rotational and
vibrational energy of the molecules (Fig. 14–2) must also be taken into account.
The internal energy will be greater at a given temperature than for a monatomic
gas, but it will still be a function only of temperature for an ideal gas.
The internal energy of real gases also depends mainly on temperature, but
where real gases deviate from ideal gas behavior, their internal energy depends
also somewhat on pressure and volume (due to atomic potential energy).
The internal energy of liquids and solids is quite complicated, for it includes
electrical potential energy associated with the forces (or “chemical”bonds) between
atoms and molecules.
