ow the Big Ideas are interwoven throughout multiple
units. For example, Big Idea 3 (Information Storage and Transmission) is covered in five units. This idea is
first introduced in Unit 1 during the discussion of nucleic acids. This idea reappears in many topics of Unit 4
(such as cell communication, signal transduction, and the cell cycle) and in several topics of Unit 5 (including
Mendelian genetics and non-Mendelian genetics). Big Idea 3 is also included in every topic of Unit 6 (gene
expression and regulation). Finally, this concept is covered in Unit 8, when discussing ecological responses to
the environment. As seen from this example, the Big Ideas are the foundation of this course and exam, and it is
important to recognize how each of these four concepts connects with multiple units and topics.
