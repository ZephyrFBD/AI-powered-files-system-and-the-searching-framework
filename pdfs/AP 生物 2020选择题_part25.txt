21. Oncogenes are genes that can cause tumor 
formation as a result of a particular mutation. 
Which of the following potential therapies 
would be most effective at preventing the 
expression of an oncogene? 
(A) Reducing the number of ribosomes in the 
cell to prevent the creation of the 
oncogene’s proteins 
(B) Blocking membrane-bound receptors of 
transcription factors 
(C) Introducing a chemical that binds to 
transcription factors associated with the 
oncogene’s promoter

for tumor suppressor genes in the cell 
22. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can damage DNA by 
breaking weak bonds. Which of the following 
best explains how this occurs?

structure by breaking the covalent bonds 
between the nitrogenous base pairs. 
(B) UV radiation di
