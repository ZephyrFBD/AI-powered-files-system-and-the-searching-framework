ancer drug paclitaxel is derived from the bark, have acquired the ability to make paclitaxel themselves,
a clear example of gene transfer.
In animals, a particularly interesting example of HGT occurs within the aphid species (Figure 20.13). Aphids are insects
that vary in color based on carotenoid content. Carotenoids are pigments made by a variety of plants, fungi, and microbes,
and they serve a variety of functions in animals, who obtain these chemicals from their food. Humans require carotenoids

to synthesize vitamin A, and we obtain them by eating orange fruits and vegetables: carrots, apricots, mangoes, and sweet
potatoes. On the other hand, aphids have acquired the ability to make the carotenoids on their own. According to DNA
analysis, this ability is due to the transfer of fungal genes into the insect by HGT, presumably as the insect consumed fungi
for food. A carotenoid enzyme called a desaturase is responsible for the red c
