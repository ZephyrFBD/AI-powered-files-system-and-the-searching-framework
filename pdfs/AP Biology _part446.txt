 LARGE. In a large population, a
small change in the gene pool will be diluted by the sheer number
of individuals and no change in the frequency of alleles will occur.
(In a small population, the smallest change in the gene pool will
have a major effect in allelic frequencies.)
THE POPULATION MUST BE ISOLATED FROM OTHER POPULATIONS.
There must be no migration of organisms into or out of the gene
pool because that could alter allelic frequencies.
THERE MUST BE NO MUTATIONS IN THE POPULATION. A mutation in
the gene pool could cause a change in allelic frequency by
introducing a new allele.
MATING MUST BE RANDOM. If individuals select mates, then those
individuals that are better adapted will have a reproductive
advantage and the population will evolve.
THERE MUST BE NO NATURAL SELECTION. Natural selection causes
changes in relative frequencies of alleles in a gene pool.
