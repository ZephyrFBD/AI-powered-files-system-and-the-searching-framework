hysical states (gas, liquid, and solid). The substance has a high specific
heat so it serves as a temperature stabilizer for other compounds and
vaporizes at a relatively high temperature.
Water plays a key role in hydrolysis, condensation, and other chemical
reactions that are essential to life. It is also fundamental to the biological
activity of nucleotides, carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. There are two
specific characteristics of water that are particularly important to
remember. First, the polar nature of water makes it “sticky.” The positive
charges on the hydrogen atoms cling to the negative charges on the
oxygen atoms between molecules; that is, water molecules attract one
another, causing water to have high surface tension. This is what makes
water bead on windshields and form round raindrops. Even matter with
greater density can float on top of water if it doesn’t break the surface
tension.
This surface tension is also the force behind capillary action, by which
water (a
