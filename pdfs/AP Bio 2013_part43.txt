27. The observation that the rabbit mRNA was 
successfully translated in the frog tissues supports 
which of the following conclusions? 
(A) Frog cells are able to replace their own 
hemoglobin with rabbit hemoglobin.  
(B) Undeveloped frog eggs can be induced to 
form genetically identical copies of a rabbit. 
(C) Rabbit hemoglobin can induce an immune 
response in frogs. 
(D) Rabbits and frogs share a common genetic 
code for expressing heritable information. 
 
28. The electrophoresis results best support which of 
the following conclusions? 
(A) Cell specialization during development 
results in some cells losing the ability to 
synthesize proteins. 
(B) Cells from different tissues share a common 
ability to use genetic material
