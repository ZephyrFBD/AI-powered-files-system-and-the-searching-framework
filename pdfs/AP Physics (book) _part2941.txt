mes been inter-
preted as an increase in the mass of an object. In this interpretation, a particle
can have a relativistic mass,
which increases with speed according to
In this “mass-increase” formula, m is referred to as the rest mass of the object.
With this interpretation, the mass of an object appears to increase as its speed
increases. But there are problems with relativistic mass. If we plug it into formu-
las like
or
we obtain formulas that do not agree with
experiment. (If we write Newton’s second law in its more general form,
that would get a correct result.) Also, be careful not to think a mass acquires
more particles or more molecules as its speed becomes very large. It doesn’t.
Today, most physicists prefer not to use relativistic mass, so an object has only
one mass (its rest mass), and it is only the momentum that increases with speed.
Whenever we talk about the mass of an object, we will always mean its rest
mass (a fixed value). [But see Problem 46.]
