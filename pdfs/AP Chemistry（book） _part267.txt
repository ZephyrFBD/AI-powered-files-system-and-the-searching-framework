ectromagnetic 
radiation similar to X rays; it does not consist of particles and it carries no charge.
The Nuclear Model of the Atom
With growing evidence that the atom is composed of smaller particles, scientists gave atten-
tion to how the particles fit together. During the early 1900s, Thomson reasoned that be-
cause electrons contribute only a very small fraction of an atom’s mass, they probably are 
responsible for an equally small fraction of the atom’s size. He proposed that the atom consists 
of a uniform positive sphere of matter in which the mass is evenly distributed and in which 
the electrons are embedded like raisins in a pudding or seeds in a watermelon (Figure 2.8). 
 
This plum-pudding model, named after a traditional English dessert, was very short-lived.
In 1910, Rutherford was studying the angles at which a particles were deflected, or scat-
tered, as they passed through a thin sheet of gold foil (Figure 2.9). He discovered that almost 
all the particles passed dire
