 (the formation of glycogen from glucose monomers) for short-term energy storage, another to
the transport of glucose into the cell. In liver cells, glycogen synthesis is also stimulated, and in addition, glucose
synthesis from smaller molecules is inhibited. In fat cells, the pathway leads to triglyceride formation (for long term
energy storage) instead of glycogen formation.
The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are an example of a kinase cascade activated by a G protein.
Mitogens (mitosis + generating) are substances that stimulate cell division. After a protein kinase receptor is
activated by a signaling molecule, the receptor dimerizes, autophosphorylates, and activates Ras, a G protein, by
exchanging a GTP for a GDP. The Ras protein then activates a mitogen-kinase (MK) cascade, where one mitogen
kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of the next mitogen kinase in the sequence. In this fashion, mitogen kinase
kinase kinase (MKKK) activates MKK, which activates MK. This final M
