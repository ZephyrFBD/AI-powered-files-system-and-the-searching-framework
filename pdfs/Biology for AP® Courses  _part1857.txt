Figure 17.4 Polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, is used to amplify a specific sequence of DNA. Primers—short pieces
of DNA complementary to each end of the target sequence—are combined with genomic DNA, Taq polymerase, and
deoxynucleotides. Taq polymerase is a DNA polymerase isolated from the thermostable bacterium Thermus aquaticus
that is able to withstand the high temperatures used in PCR. Thermus aquaticus grows in the Lower Geyser Basin of
Yellowstone National Park. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is similar to PCR, but cDNA is made from an RNA
template before PCR begins.
DNA fragments can also be amplified from an RNA template in a process called reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR).
The first step is to recreate the original DNA template strand (called cDNA) by applying DNA nucleotides to the mRNA.
This process is called reverse transcription. This requires the presence of an enzyme called
