nmental Limits to Population Growth
Populations with unlimited resources grow exponentially, with an accelerating growth rate. When resources become
limiting, populations follow a logistic growth curve. The population of a species will level off at the carrying capacity of
its environment.
36.4 Population Dynamics and Regulation
Populations are regulated by a variety of density-dependent and density-independent factors. Species are divided into two
categories based on a variety of features of their life history patterns: r-selected species, which have large numbers of
offspring, and K-selected species, which have few offspring. The r- and K-selection theory has fallen out of use; however,
many of its key features are still used in newer, demographically-based models of population dynamics.
36.5 Human Population Growth
The world’s human population is growing at an exponential rate. Humans have increased the world’s carrying capacity
through migration, agriculture, medical advances, and
