tatistically significant difference between species B and species C.
(d) Species A would be best suited for a dry climate because its rate of water loss due to transpiration is lower
than that of species B and species C.

(a) This is an example of artificial selection because a person is selecting for a particular trait (antibiotic
resistance).
(b) Since plate 2 contains the antibiotic, only bacteria with resistance to the antibiotic will grow on plate 2.
Plate 1 does not contain antibiotic, so bacteria with and without resistance to the antibiotic will grow on
plate 1. There will be fewer bacteria on plate 2 than on plate 1.
(c) Plate 6 will have bacteria with the greatest resistance to the antibiotic.
(d) Plate 6 has the greatest concentration of ampicillin, so the bacteria that survive on that plate will have the
greatest resistance to ampicillin.

(a) Seagulls have no predators in this ecosystem. Penguins are prey for seals. Penguins are primary consumers
