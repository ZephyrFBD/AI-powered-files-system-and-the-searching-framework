 
(Eq. 17–3). The loss in potential
energy will equal its gain in kinetic energy (energy conservation).
SOLUTION (a) The charge on an electron is 
Therefore its change in potential energy is
The minus sign indicates that the potential energy decreases. The potential
difference,
has a positive sign because the final potential 
is higher than the
initial potential 
Negative electrons are attracted toward a positive electrode
(or plate) and repelled away from a negative electrode.
(b) The potential energy lost by the electron becomes kinetic energy KE. From
conservation of energy (Eq. 6–11a),
so
where the initial kinetic energy is zero since we are given that the electron
started from rest. So the final
(c) In the equation just above we solve for v:
NOTE The electric potential energy does not depend on the mass, only on the
charge and voltage. The speed does depend on m.
