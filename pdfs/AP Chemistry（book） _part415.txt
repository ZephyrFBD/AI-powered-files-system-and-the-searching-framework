reactions we observe involve O2 from air as a reactant. The combustion of hydrocarbons 
(compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen) in air, as illustrated in Equation 3.5, 
is a major energy-producing process in our world. 
(Section 2.9) 
Hydrocarbons combusted in air react with O2 to form CO2 and H2O.* The number of 
molecules of O2 required and the number of molecules of CO2 and H2O formed  
depend 
on the composition of the hydrocarbon, which acts as the fuel in the reaction. For example, 
the combustion of propane (C3H8, Figure 3.8), a gas used for cooking and home heating, is 
described by the equation
 
C3H81g2 + 5 O21g2 ยก 3 CO21g2 + 4 H2O1g2  
[3.9] 
The state of the water in this reaction, H2O1g2 or H2O1l2, depends on the  
reaction condi-
tions. In this case, H2O(g) is formed as the high-temperature flame burns in air.
Combustion of oxygen-containing derivatives of hydrocarbons, such as CH3OH, 
also produces CO2 and H2O. The rule that hydrocarbons and their oxyg
