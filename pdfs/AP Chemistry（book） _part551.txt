 hydroxides are generally 
insoluble. Because Mg2+ is not an exception, Mg(OH22 is insoluble and thus forms a pre-
cipitate. NaNO3, however, is soluble, so Na+ and NO3
- remain in solution. The balanced 
equation for the precipitation reaction is
 
Mg1NO3221aq2 + 2 NaOH1aq2 ยก Mg1OH221s2 + 2 NaNO31aq2
