om one another, but they all share certain fundamental characteristics.
All types of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum at 2.998 * 108 m>s, 
the speed of light. All have wave-like characteristics similar to those of waves that move 
through water. Water waves are the result of energy imparted to the water, perhaps by 
a dropped stone or the movement of a boat across the waterâ€™s surface (Figure 6.1). This 
energy is expressed as the up-and-down movements of the water.
A cross section of a water wave (Figure 6.2) shows that it is periodic, which means that 
the pattern of peaks and troughs repeats itself at regular intervals. The distance between 
two adjacent peaks (or between two adjacent troughs) is called the wavelength. The 
number of complete wavelengths, or cycles, that pass a given point each second is the 
frequency of the wave.
Just as with water waves, we can assign a frequency and wavelength to electromag-
netic waves, as illustrated in Figure 6.3. These and all
