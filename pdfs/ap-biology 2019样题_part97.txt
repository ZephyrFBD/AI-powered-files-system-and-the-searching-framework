Tonicity and 
Osmoregulation
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
ENE-2
Cells have membranes that allow them to establish and maintain internal 
environments that are different from their external environments.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-2.H
Explain how concentration 
gradients affect the 
movement of molecules 
across membranes.
ENE-2.H.1
External environments can be hypotonic, 
hypertonic or isotonic to internal environments 
of cells—
a. Water moves by osmosis from areas 
of high water potential/low osmolarity/
low solute concentration to areas of low 
water potential/high osmolarity/high 
solute concentration.
