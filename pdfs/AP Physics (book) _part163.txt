es and the axes wherever you
like to make your calculations easier. You also choose
which direction is positive and which is negative.
Usually we choose the x axis to the right as positive.]
4. Write down what quantities are “known” or “given,”
and then what you want to know. Consider quan-
tities both at the beginning and at the end of the
chosen time interval. You may need to “translate”
language into physical terms, such as “starts from
rest” means
5. Think about which principles of physics apply in
this problem. Use common sense and your own
experiences. Then plan an approach.
6. Consider which equations (and/or definitions) relate
the quantities involved. Before using them, be sure
their range of validity includes your problem (for
example, Eqs. 2–11 are valid only when the accel-
eration is constant). If you find an applicable
v0 = 0.
t = 0.
