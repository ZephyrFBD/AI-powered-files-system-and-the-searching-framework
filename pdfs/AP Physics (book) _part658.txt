ghter climbs a flight of stairs 28.0 m high.
How much work does he do?
2. (I) The head of a hammer with a mass of 1.2 kg is allowed to
fall onto a nail from a height of 0.50 m. What is the maxi-
mum amount of work it could do on the nail? Why do people
not just “let it fall” but add their own force to the hammer
as it falls?
3. (II) How much work did the movers do (horizontally) push-
ing a 46.0-kg crate 10.3 m across a rough floor without
acceleration, if the effective coefficient of friction was
0.50?
4. (II) A 1200-N crate rests on the floor. How much work is
required to move it at constant speed (a) 5.0 m along 
the floor against a friction force of 230 N, and (b) 5.0 m
vertically?
5. (II) What is the minimum work needed to push a 950-kg
car 710 m up along a 9.0° incline? Ignore friction.
6. (II) Estimate the work you do to mow a lawn 10 m by 20 m
with a 50-cm-wide mower. Assume you push with a force
of about 15 N.
7. (II) In a certain library the first shelf is 15.0 cm off the gro
