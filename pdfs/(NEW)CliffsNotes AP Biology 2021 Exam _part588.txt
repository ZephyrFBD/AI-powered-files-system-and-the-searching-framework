14. C. Flame cells function in the excretory system of flatworms. Be careful not to confuse excretory and digestive
functions. Excretory systems maintain water balance, filter body fluids, and remove cellular wastes, such as nitrogen
wastes (often in the form of urea). The digestive system chemically breaks down food into absorbable molecules.
Feces consist mostly of undigested food and bacteria, material that never really entered any cells of the body.
