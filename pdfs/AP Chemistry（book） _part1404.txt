this example, at 0.74 Å) corresponds to the bond length of the molecule. The potential 
energy at this minimum corresponds to the bond strength. Thus, the observed bond 
length is the distance at which the attractive forces between unlike charges (electrons 
and nuclei) are balanced by the repulsive forces between like charges (electron–electron 
and nucleus–nucleus).
