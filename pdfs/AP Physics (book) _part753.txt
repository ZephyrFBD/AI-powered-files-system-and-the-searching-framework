CHAPTER 7
Linear Momentum
1. We claim that momentum is conserved. Yet most moving
objects eventually slow down and stop. Explain.
2. A light object and a heavy object have the same kinetic
energy. Which has the greater momentum? Explain.
3. When a person jumps from a tree to the ground, what happens
to the momentum of the person upon striking the ground?
4. When you release an inflated but untied balloon, why does
it fly across the room?
5. Explain, on the basis of conservation of momentum, how a
fish propels itself forward by swishing its tail back and forth.
6. Two children float motionlessly in a space station. The 
20-kg girl pushes on the 40-kg boy and he sails away at
The girl (a) remains motionless; (b) moves in the
same direction at 
(c) moves in the opposite direc-
tion at 
(d) moves in the opposite direction at
(e) none of these.
7. According to Eq. 7â€“4, the lon
