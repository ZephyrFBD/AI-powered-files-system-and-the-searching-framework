ss, the reception of radio and TV
programs at home. A simple radio receiver is diagrammed in Fig. 22–16. The EM
waves sent out by all stations are received by the antenna. The signals the antenna
detects and sends to the receiver are very small and contain frequencies from many
different stations. The receiver uses a resonant LC circuit (Section 21–15) to select
out a particular RF frequency (actually a narrow range of frequencies) correspond-
ing to a particular station. A simple way of tuning a station is shown in Fig. 22–17.
A particular station is “tuned in” by adjusting C and or L so that the resonant
frequency of the circuit (
Eq. 21–19) equals that of the station’s
carrier frequency. The signal, containing both audio and carrier frequencies, next
goes to the demodulator, or detector (Fig. 22–16), where “demodulation” takes
place—that is, the audio signal is separated from the RF carrier frequency. The
audio signal is amplified and sent to a loudspeaker or headphones.
