nless, but the floor is not, deter-
mine the forces exerted on the ladder by the floor and by the wall.
APPROACH Figure 9–11 is the free-body diagram for the ladder, showing all
the forces acting on the ladder. The wall, since it is frictionless, can exert a force
only perpendicular to the wall, and we label that force 
The cement floor
exerts a force 
which has both horizontal and vertical force components:
is frictional and 
is the normal force. Finally, gravity exerts a force
on the ladder at its midpoint, since the
ladder is uniform.
SOLUTION Again we use the equilibrium conditions,
We will need all three since there are three unknowns:
and
. The y component of the force equation is
so immediately we have
The x component of the force equation is
To determine both 
and 
we need a torque equation. If we choose to 
calculate torques about an axis through the point where the ladder touches 
the cement floor, then 
which acts at this point, will have a lever arm of 
zero and so won’t en
