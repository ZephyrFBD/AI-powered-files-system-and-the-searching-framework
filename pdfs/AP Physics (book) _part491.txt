 Earth on any object decreases
with the square of its distance r from the Earth’s center:
The Moon is 60 Earth radii away, so it feels a gravitational force only
times as strong as it would if it were at a point on the Earth’s surface.
Newton realized that the force of gravity on an object depends not only on
distance but also on the object’s mass. In fact, it is directly proportional to its
mass, as we have seen (Eq. 4–3). According to Newton’s third law, when the Earth
exerts its gravitational force on any object, such as the Moon, that object exerts an
equal and opposite force on the Earth (Fig. 5–17). Because of this symmetry,
Newton reasoned, the magnitude of the force of gravity must be proportional to
both masses:
where 
and 
are the masses of the Earth and the other object, respectively,
and r is the distance from the Earth’s center to the center of the other object.
