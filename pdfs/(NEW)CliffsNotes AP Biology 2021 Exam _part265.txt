ill be Tt. However, the
identification of the genotype as TT will become more conclusive as the number of offspring observed increases.
Incomplete Dominance
Sometimes, the alleles for a gene do not exhibit the dominant and recessive behaviors discussed above. Instead, the
combined expression of two different alleles in the heterozygous condition produces a blending of the individual
expressions of the two alleles called incomplete dominance. In snapdragons, for example, the heterozygous
condition consisting of one allele for red flowers ( R ) and one allele for white flowers ( r ) results in a pink
phenotype ( Rr ). Sometimes, both alleles are written with the same uppercase or lowercase letter but with a prime or
a superscript or subscript number or letter to differentiate the two. As an example, R and Râ€² might represent red and
white alleles for snapdragons. As another example, H1
and H2might represent straight and curly hair alleles in humans. The H1H2
phenotype is expressed as an i
