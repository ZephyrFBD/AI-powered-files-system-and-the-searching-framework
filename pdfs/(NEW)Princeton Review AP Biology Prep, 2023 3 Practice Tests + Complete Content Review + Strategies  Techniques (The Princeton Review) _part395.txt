, too, were dark. The dark- and the light-colored moths
lived happily side by side until something from the outside—in our example, the environment—changed all that.
The initial variation came about by chance. This variation gave the dark moths an edge. However, that advantage did
not become apparent until something made it apparent. In our case, that something was the intensive pollution from
coal burning. The abundance of soot made it easier for predators to spot the light-colored moths, thus effectively
removing them from the population. Therefore, dark color is an adaptation, a variation favored by natural selection.
Survival of the fittest is the name of the game, and any trait that causes an individual to reproduce better gives that
individual evolutionary fitness.
Fittest of the Fit
Don’t confuse evolutionary fitness with physical fitness. Often, things like
strength and speed will increase evolutionary fitness, but anything that
increases survival and reproducing will add to ev
