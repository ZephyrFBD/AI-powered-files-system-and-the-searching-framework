state, and such
images can produce resolution of 1 mm or better. This NMR technique (some-
times called spin-echo) produces images of great diagnostic value, both in the
delineation of structure (anatomy) and in the study of metabolic processes. An
NMR image is shown in Fig. 31–27.
NMR imaging is considered to be noninvasive. We can calculate the 
energy of the photons involved: as mentioned above, in a 1.0-T magnetic 
field,
for 
This corresponds to an energy of 
or about 
Since molecular
bonds are on the order of 1 eV, the RF photons can cause little cellular disrup-
tion. This should be compared to X- or 
rays, whose energies are 
to 
and thus can cause significant damage. The static magnetic fields, though often
large (as high as 1.0 to 1.5 T), are believed to be harmless (except for people who
wear heart pacemakers).
