ubule also adjusts blood pH by selectively secreting
ammonia (NH3) into the filtrate, where it reacts with H+ to form NH4+. The more acidic the filtrate, the more ammonia
is secreted. (3) The descending loop of Henle is lined with cells containing aquaporins that allow water to pass from
the filtrate into the interstitial fluid. (4) In the thin part of the ascending loop of Henle, Na+ and Cl– ions diffuse into the
interstitial fluid. In the thick part, these same ions are actively transported into the interstitial fluid. Because salt but not
water is lost, the filtrate becomes more dilute as it travels up the limb. (5) In the distal convoluted tubule, K+ and H+ ions
are selectively secreted into the filtrate, while Na+, Cl–, and HCO3– ions are reabsorbed to maintain pH and electrolyte
balance in the blood. (6) The collecting duct reabsorbs solutes and water from the filtrate, forming dilute urine. (credit:
