(such as insulin) into a bacterium for production. In other words, bacteria can be hijacked and put to work as little
protein factories. This branch of technology that produces new organisms or products by transferring genes between
cells is called genetic engineering.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a laboratory technique that is used to create billions of identical copies of
genes within hours. The process of creating many copies of genes is known as amplification. PCR utilizes a
machine called a thermocycler to mimic the process of DNA replication, thereby creating many copies of genes.
Amplified DNA fragments have many practical uses. For example, they can be utilized to perform phylogenetic
analyses.
Transformation
Insulin, the protein hormone that lowers blood sugar levels, can now be made for medical purposes by bacteria. Yes,
bacteria can be induced to use the universal DNA code to transcribe and translate a human gene! The process of
