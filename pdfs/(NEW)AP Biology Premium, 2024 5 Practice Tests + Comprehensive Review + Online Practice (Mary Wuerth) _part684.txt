y repressors can bind
directly to the operator.
58. (C) The cell membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer in which the polar phosphate heads are on both
the inner and outer surfaces of the membrane and the hydrophobic lipid tails are in the interior of the membrane.
The hydrophobic portions of transmembrane proteins would most likely be found in contact with the
hydrophobic (nonpolar) lipids in the cell membrane. The hydrophobic portions of transmembrane proteins
would be repelled by the polar phosphates of the phospholipids, so choice (A) is incorrect. Both the aqueous
surroundings of the cell and the cellâ€™s cytosol are largely polar, so the hydrophobic portions of transmembrane
proteins would be repelled by those environments, making choices (B) and (D) incorrect.
59. (D) Ribosomes produce proteins, so a cell that produced large amounts of a peptide (protein) hormone would
likely have a high concentration of ribosomes. Lysosomes are involved in digesting compounds; they are not
