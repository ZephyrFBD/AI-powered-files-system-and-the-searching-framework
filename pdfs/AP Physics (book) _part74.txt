to about 0.1 cm (1 mm), the smallest
division on the ruler, although half of this value might be a valid claim as well.
The reason is that it is difficult for the observer to estimate (or “interpolate”)
between the smallest divisions. Furthermore, the ruler itself may not have been
manufactured to an accuracy very much better than this.
When giving the result of a measurement, it is important to state the
estimated uncertainty in the measurement. For example, the width of a board
might be written as
The 
(“plus or minus 0.1 cm”) repre-
sents the estimated uncertainty in the measurement, so that the actual width
most likely lies between 8.7 and 8.9 cm. The percent uncertainty is the ratio of
the uncertainty to the measured value, multiplied by 100. For example, if the
measurement is 8.8 cm and the uncertainty about 0.1 cm, the percent uncertainty is
“is approximately equal to.”
Often the uncertainty in a measured value is not specified explicitly. In such
cases, the
uncertainty in a num
