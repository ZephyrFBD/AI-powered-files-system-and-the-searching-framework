When energy travels through a food chain, only 10% of the energy
is actually converted into organic matter at the next trophic level.
The rest is lost to heat and cellular respiration in animals along
the way. Toxins that enter at the bottom of a food chain accumulate
and concentrate in the higher trophic levels. This phenomenon is
called biological magnification.
The distribution of local and global ecosystems changes over time.
This refers to ecological succession and biomes.
Lastly, humans threaten Earth in many ways. Our population is
increasing exponentially. We waste natural resources, destroy
animal habitats, and pollute the air and water. Be able to discuss
other specific examples of how humans negatively impact our
world, such as acid rain and acidification of the oceans,
eutrophication of lakes, global warming, and the introduction of
invasive species. A
