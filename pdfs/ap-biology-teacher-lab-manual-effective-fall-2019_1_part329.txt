 the cups to indicate what solution is inside the cell 
and inside the cup. 
Step 2 Make dialysis tubing cells by tying a knot in one end of five pieces of dialysis 
tubing. Fill each “cell” with 10 mL of the solution you chose for the inside, and knot the 
other end, leaving enough space for water to diffuse into the cell. 
Step 3 Weigh each cell, record the initial weight, and then place it into a cup filled with the 
second solution for that pair. Weigh the cell after 30 minutes and record the final weight. 
Step 4 Calculate the percent change in weight using the following formula:  
(final – initial)/initial X 100. Record your results. 
•  Which pair(s) that you tested did not have a change in weight? How can you explain 
this? 
•  If you compared 1 M solutions, was a 1 M NaCl solution more or less hypertonic 
than a 1 M sucrose solution? What is your evidence? What about  
1 M NaCl and 1 M glucose and 1 M sucrose? 
•  Does the protein solution have a high molarity? What is evidenc
