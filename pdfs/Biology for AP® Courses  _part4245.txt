s low or nonexistent. Bogs usually occur in areas where there is a clay bottom with poor percolation. Percolation is
the movement of water through the pores in the soil or rocks. The water found in a bog is stagnant and oxygen depleted
because the oxygen that is used during the decomposition of organic matter is not replaced. As the oxygen in the water is
depleted, decomposition slows. This leads to organic acids and other acids building up and lowering the pH of the water.
At a lower pH, nitrogen becomes unavailable to plants. This creates a challenge for plants because nitrogen is an important
limiting resource. Some types of bog plants (such as sundews, pitcher plants, and Venus flytraps) capture insects and extract
the nitrogen from their bodies. Bogs have low net primary productivity because the water found in bogs has low levels of
nitrogen and oxygen.
