Junctions
Gap junctions in animals and plasmodesmata in plants are connections between the plasma membranes of neighboring cells.
These fluid-filled channels allow small signaling molecules, called intracellular mediators, to diffuse between the two
cells. Small molecules, such as calcium ions (Ca2+), are able to move between cells, but large molecules like proteins and
DNA cannot fit through the channels. The specificity of the channels ensures that the cells remain independent but can
quickly and easily transmit signals. The transfer of signaling molecules communicates the current state of the cell that is
directly next to the target cell; this allows a group of cells to coordinate their response to a signal that only one of them may
have received. In plants, plasmodesmata are ubiquitous, making the entire plant into a giant communication network.
