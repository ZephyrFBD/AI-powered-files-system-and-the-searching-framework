xercise 8.5 we saw that 
the dipole moment of HCl corresponds to a partial charge of 0.178+ 
on H and 0.178- on Cl, in remarkably good agreement with our sim-
ple approximation based on electronegativities. Although our ap-
proximation method provides ballpark numbers for the magnitude 
of charge on atoms, the relationship between electronegativities and 
charge separation is generally more complicated. As we have already 
seen, computer programs employing quantum-mechanical princi-
ples have been developed to obtain more accurate estimates of the 
partial charges on atoms, even in complex molecules. A computer- 
graphical representation of the calculated charge distribution in HCl 
is shown in Figure 8.12(c).
