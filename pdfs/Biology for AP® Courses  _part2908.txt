Using a human eating a turkey sandwich as an example, food is ingested through the mouth. The mouth is the location
where both mechanical (chewing) and chemical breakdown of food begins via the enzyme amylase, which breaks down
carbohydrates into simpler sugars. The food bolus then travels by peristalsis (alternating waves of contraction) down the
pharynx and esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, pepsinogen mixes with hydrochloric acid to form pepsin, which
begins digesting proteins, such as turkey, into smaller chains of amino acids. Mucus in the stomach protects its lining
from damage by acidity, and the tightening of a sphincter prevents stomach contents from regurgitating into the esophagus.
Further digestion of the ingredients of the sandwich occurs in the small intestine aided by a variety of enzymes; for example,
bile salts and pancreatic amylase dumped into the small intestine from the gallbladder and pancreas, respectively, help
emulsify fats. Once the ingredients of t
