(A) Trabectedin increases the production of

(B)
Trabectedin interferes with the plasma
membrane, causing it to break down and
expose the DNA to damage. 
(C)
Trabectedin interferes with the duplication
of DNA during interphase and thus
prevents cancer cells from passing the G2
checkpoint. 
(D) Trabectedin interferes with the regulations
of cyclin proteins, causing their levels to
increase and creating errors in DNA.
