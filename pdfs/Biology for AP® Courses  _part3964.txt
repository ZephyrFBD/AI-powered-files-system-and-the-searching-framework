Figure 33.25 (a) Affinity refers to the strength of single interaction between antigen and antibody, while avidity refers
to the strength of all interactions combined. (b) An antibody may cross react with different epitopes.
The term avidity describes binding by antibody classes that are secreted as joined, multivalent structures (such as IgM
and IgA). Although avidity measures the strength of binding, just as affinity does, the avidity is not simply the sum of the
affinities of the antibodies in a multimeric structure. The avidity depends on the number of identical binding sites on the
antigen being detected, as well as other physical and chemical factors. Typically, multimeric antibodies, such as pentameric
IgM, are classified as having lower affinity than monomeric antibodies, but high avidity. Essentially, the fact that multimeric
antibodies can bind many antigens s
