seven Science Practices.
Big Idea 2
Biological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,
and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.
Enduring
Understanding
2.B
Growth, reproduction and dynamic homeostasis require that cells create and maintain
internal environments that are different from their external environments.
Essential
Knowledge
2.B.3 Eukaryotic cells maintain internal membranes that partition the cell into specialized
regions.
