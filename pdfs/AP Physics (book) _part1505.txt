s in the direction tending to equalize the tempera-
ture. If the two objects are kept in contact long enough for their temperatures to
become equal, the objects are said to be in thermal equilibrium, and there is no
further heat flow between them. For example, when a fever thermometer is first
placed in your mouth, heat flows from your mouth to the thermometer. When
the thermometer reaches the same temperature as the inside of your mouth, the
thermometer and your mouth are then in equilibrium, and no more heat flows.
Heat and temperature are often confused. They are very different concepts,
and in this Chapter we will make a clear distinction between them. We begin by
defining and using the concept of heat. We also discuss how heat is used in
calorimetry, how it is involved in changes of state of matter, and the processes of
heat transfer—conduction, convection, and radiation.
14–1 Heat as Energy Transfer
We use the term “heat” in everyday life as if we knew what we meant. But the
term
