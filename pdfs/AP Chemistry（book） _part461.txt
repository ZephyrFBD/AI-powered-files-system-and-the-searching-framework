lustrated in Figure 3.16. These three 
conversions can be combined in a single equation:
 Grams CO2 = 11.00 g C4H102a 1 mol C4H10
58.0 g C4H10
b a 8 mol CO2
2 mol C4H10
b a
44.0 g CO2
1 mol CO2
b 
 = 3.03 g CO2
To calculate the amount of O2 consumed in the reaction of Equation 3.13, we 
again rely on the coefficients in the balanced equation for our stoichiometric factor, 
2 mol C4H10 ] 13 mol O2:
 Grams O2 = 11.00 g C4H102a 1 mol C4H10
58.0 g C4H10
b a 13 mol O2
2 mol C4H10
b a
32.0 g O2
1 mol O2
b 
 = 3.59 g O2

Give It Some Thought 
In the previous example, 1.00 g of C4H10 reacts with 3.59 g of O2 to form 3.03 g of 
CO2. Using only addition and subtraction, calculate the amount of H2O produced.
