es was through so-called thought experiments. Thought exper-
iments are hypothetical scenarios that can lead to paradoxes within 
a given theory. Let’s brieﬂy discuss one of these thought experiments 
that was used to test ideas within quantum theory.
Quantum theory caused a great deal of discussion with respect to 
its nondeterministic description of matter. We have touched on two 
such areas in this chapter. First, we have seen that the descriptions 
of light and matter have become less distinct—light has particle-like 
properties and matter has wave-like properties. The description of 
matter that results—in which we can talk only about the probability 
of an electron being at a certain place as opposed to knowing exactly 
where it is—was very bothersome to many. Einstein, for example, fa-
mously said that “God doesn’t play dice with the world”* about this 
probabilistic description. Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, which
