ansport pumps in the membrane actively restore the ions to
the appropriate side. Other ions, such as large, negatively charged proteins and nucleic acids, reside inside the cell. It
is these large, negatively charged ions that contribute to the overall negative charge on the inside of the cell
membrane compared to the outside.
The following events characterize the transmission of a nerve impulse (Figure 13-1):
1. Resting potential and graded potentials. The resting potential describes the unstimulated, polarized state of a
neuron (at about −70 millivolts). A stimulus arriving at the plasma membrane of a neuron can open or close a gated
ion channel. Depending upon the kind of ion channel activated, the membrane potential can become depolarized, or
more positive on the inside (for example, −60 mv) or hyperpolarized, or more negative on the inside (for example
−80 mv). Weak stimuli that cause small variations in the membrane potential are called graded potentials. Because
