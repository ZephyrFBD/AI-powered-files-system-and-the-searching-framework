 up the lane. Malachy calls,Telegram boy, do you have something for

 rides away. 
 
 Mam puffs on her Woodbine.Well, we have all day though I’d like

 the butcher. She can’t leave the fire and we can’t leave the lane for fear 
 
 the telegram boy might come and find no one at home.Then we’d have

 weekend entirely.We’d have to watch the Meehans and everyone el
