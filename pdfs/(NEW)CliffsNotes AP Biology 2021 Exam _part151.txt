CoA. Proteins are hydrolyzed to amino acids. Each of the various amino acids produces
different products when broken down. Some of these products are converted to acetyl CoA; others are converted to
OAA or other Krebs cycle intermediates. NH3is a toxic waste product from amino acid breakdown and is exported
from the cell.
Question 3
The first part of this question is the same as question 2, except there is an
additional focus on the function of O2. For this question, then, it is especially important that you state that the
purpose of O2is to accept
electrons at the end of the electron transport chain in oxidative phosphorylation. Then describe the consequences if
oxygen is not presentâ€” no ATP, no oxidative phosphorylation, and no Krebs cycle. For the second part, you would
describe lactic acid fermentation and alcohol fermentation, specifically indicating that the function of these two
processes is to
regenerate NAD+so that glycolysis can continue and produce 2 ATP for each glucose.
