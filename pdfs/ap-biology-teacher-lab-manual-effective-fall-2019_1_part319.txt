n of solute to the water 
lowers the solute potential and therefore decreases the water potential. This means that a 
solution at atmospheric pressure has a negative water potential due to the solute. 
The solute potential (ψ ) = – iCRT

, where i is the ionization constant, C is the molar 
concentration, R is the pressure constant (R = 0.0831 liter bars/mole-K), and T is the 
temperature in K (273 + °C). 
A 0.15 M solution of sucrose at atmospheric pressure (ψP = 0) and 25°C has an 
osmotic potential of -3.7 bars and a water potential of -3.7 bars. A bar is a metric 
measure of pressure and is the same as 1 atmosphere at sea level. A 0.15 M NaCl 
solution contains 2 ions, Na+ and Cl-; therefore i = 2 and the water potential = -7.4 bars. 
When a cell’s cytoplasm is separated from pure water by a selectively permeable 
membrane, water moves from the surrounding area, where the water potential is higher 
(ψ = 0), into the cell, where water potential is lower because of solutes in the cy
