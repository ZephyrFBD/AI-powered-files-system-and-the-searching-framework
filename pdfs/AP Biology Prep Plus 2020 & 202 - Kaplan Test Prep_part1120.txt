a reproductive advantage, resulting
in directional selection in species D.
(A)
The interbreeding of species A and D led to a new hybrid phenotype.
(B)
Higher UV reflectance provides a reproductive advantage, thus
causing disruptive selection in species D.
(C)
Higher UV reflectance provides a reproductive advantage, thus
causing stabilizing selection in the population.

55. As part of an experiment, a cell biologist treats cultured mitochondria
with 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), a compound that dissipates the
mitochondrial proton gradient, and measures the resulting oxygen
concentration in the culture compared to that of untreated controls. In
follow-up experiments, the cell biologist also plans to measure additional
metabolic markers to evaluate DNP’s eﬀects on cellular metabolism.
Based on the data represented in Figure 1, what could the cell biologist
reasonably expect to find following the addition of DNP?

culture with and without DNP
