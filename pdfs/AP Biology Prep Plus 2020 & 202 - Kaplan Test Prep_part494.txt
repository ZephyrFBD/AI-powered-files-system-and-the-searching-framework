1. The following diagrams represent biotic and abiotic components
of the arctic tundra. Which diagram represents the most accurate
flow of energy between the components of the ecosystem?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
2. A small pond is populated by algae, paramecia, and amoebae.
Sunlight is absorbed by the microscopic algae. Paramecia eat the
algae. Amoebae feed on the paramecia and algae. Which of the
following statements is correct about the pond, based on the laws
of thermodynamics?
Algae transform all of the solar energy into chemical energy
in the form of sugars.
(A)
Solar energy is only converted into chemical energy in this
ecosystem.
(B)
Photosynthesis is an endergonic process because algae have
more energy at the en
