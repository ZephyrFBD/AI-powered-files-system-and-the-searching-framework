of the X operon.
(A)
Protein X induces a positive feedback loop on itself, while protein Y
promotes transcription of the X operon.
(B)
Protein X induces a negative feedback loop on itself, while protein Y
inhibits transcription of the X operon.
(C)
Protein X induces a negative feedback loop on itself, while protein Y
promotes transcription of the X operon.

24. The researcher does a fourth experiment in which they add high amounts
of lactose to E. coli cells. AÈ‡erward, the researcher sees an increase in
protein Y levels. How does lactose increase protein Y levels?
Lactose acts as an enhancer of the Y operon.
(A)
Lactose decreases transcription of the X operon, thereby stopping
protein X from acting as a repressor for the Y operon.
(B)
Lactose binds to the Y operon repressor as an inducer.
(C)
Lactose inhibits RNA polymerase from binding to the Y operon
promoter.

25. In a later discovery, the researcher learns that glucose acts as a
corepressor for the Y operon. How would high le
