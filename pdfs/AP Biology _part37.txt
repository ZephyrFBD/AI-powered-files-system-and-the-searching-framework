PROPERTIES OF WATER
Figure 2.1 H2O: A Polar Molecule
Because the oxygen atom in a molecule of water exerts a greater pull on
the shared electrons than do the hydrogen atoms, one side of the molecule
has a slightly negative charge and the other side has a slightly positive
charge. The molecule is therefore asymmetrical and highly polar. See
Figure 2.1. In addition, the positive hydrogen of one molecule is attracted
to the negative oxygen of an adjacent molecule. The two molecules are
held together by this hydrogen bonding. The strong hydrogen attraction
that water molecules have for each other is responsible for the special
characteristics of water that are important for life on Earth. See Figure 2.2,
which shows the hydrogen atom of one molecule of water attracted to the
oxygen atom of an adjacent molecule.

Living systems depend on the properties of water that result from its polarity and
hydrogen bonding.
