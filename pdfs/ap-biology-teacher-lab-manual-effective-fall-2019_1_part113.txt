 they are able to transfer their modeling insights to other 
subject areas (Svoboda 2010). The impact of working with models on student learning 
makes modeling instruction well worth the time invested.

■ CONCLUSION  
The pyramid model for quantitative reasoning in biology (see Figure 1) demonstrates 
that there are various biological activities that are useful in many laboratory contexts 
and student learning. However, from a teaching standpoint, it must be stressed that the 
pyramid can be easily misconstrued as stressing activities at the bottom because that 
portion of the pyramid is larger, or that the only goal is to get all students to be good 
modelers. An alternative structure, such as the interconnected network, would be an 
equally valid organizational tool (see Figure 8). It is realistic because all of the arenas 
interact and rei
