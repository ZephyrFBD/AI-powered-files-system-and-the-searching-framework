stem states that the drug binds to a location that is not
the active site and subsequently deactivates the enzyme, which is an
example of allosteric inhibition, (C). Upon binding, the drug causes the
enzyme to change shape, which stops it from being able to bind the
substrate. In noncompetitive inhibition, the enzyme possesses two
active sites that bind two substrates that do not resemble each other. If
one substrate binds to its active site, it blocks the other substrate from
binding to the other active site. Here, the question stem tells us the
drug is not binding to an active site at all. Thus, this is not an example
of noncompetitive inhibition, (A). Because it does not bind at the
active site itself, the drug is not in direct competition with the
substrate. Thus, this is not an example of competitive inhibition,
eliminating (B). (D) is incorrect because the inhibition is allosteric, as
noted above.
