ore of the halogens, or a special grouping 
of carbon and oxygen atoms, such as the carboxylic acid group, —COOH. Here are a few 
examples of functional groups you will be encountering in the chapters that lie ahead 
(the functional group is outlined in blue):

properties of alkanes and alcohols change as the chains get longer. Octanes, which are 
alkanes with eight carbon atoms, are liquids under normal conditions. If the alkane 
series is extended to tens of thousands of carbon atoms, we obtain polyethylene, a solid 
substance that is used to make thousands of plastic products, such as plastic bags, food 
containers, and laboratory equipment.
