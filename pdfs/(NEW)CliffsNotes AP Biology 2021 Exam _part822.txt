different treatments on the rate of H2O2decomposition. In this part of
 
the investigation, you investigate the effect of pH. You prepare a series of
 
test tubes, substituting various pH solutions for the H2O component in the
 
baseline solution. For each pH investigated, record the amount of
 
accumulated product (measured by color intensity, absorbance, or O2
generated), at various time intervals and graph that data to determine the rate of each reaction. Then plot the rates
together on a graph as a function of pH.
Part III: Investigate Other Effects on Enzyme Activity
In this part of the investigation, you explore how the rate of peroxidase activity is influence by a variable of your
choice. Consider enzyme concentration, substrate concentration, or temperature. Be sure that you test only one
variable at a time. For example if you investigate the effect of enzyme or substrate concentration by adding
additional enzyme or
substrate, be sure to reduce the amount of H2O by the same amo
