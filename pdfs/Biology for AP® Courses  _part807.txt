7.3 | Oxidation of Pyruvate and the Citric Acid Cycle
In this section, you will explore the following question:
•
How is pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, prepared for entry into the citric acid cycle?
•
What are the products of the citric acid cycle?
Connection for AP® Courses
In the next stage of cellular respiration—and in the presence of oxygen—pyruvate produced in glycolysis is transformed
into an acetyl group attached to a carrier molecule of coenzyme A. The resulting acetyl CoA is usually delivered from the
cytoplasm to the mitochondria, a process that uses some ATP. In the mitochondria, acetyl CoA continues on to the citric acid
cycle. The citric acid cycle (CAC or TCA- tricarboxylic acid cycle) is also known as the Krebs cycle. During the conversion
of pyruvate into the acetyl group, a molecule of CO2 and two high-energy electrons are removed. (Remember that glycolysis
produces two molecules of
