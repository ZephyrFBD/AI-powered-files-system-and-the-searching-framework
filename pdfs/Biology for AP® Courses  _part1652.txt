ukaryotic transcription does not end with the polymerases and promoters. An army of basal transcription
factors, enhancers, and silencers also help to regulate the frequency with which pre-mRNA is synthesized from a gene.
Enhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed. Basal
transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation complex on the DNA template that subsequently recruits
RNA polymerase II for transcription initiation.
The names of the basal transcription factors begin with “TFII” (this is the transcription factor for RNA polymerase II) and
are specified with the letters A–J. The transcription factors systematically fall into place on the DNA template, with each
one further stabilizing the preinitiation complex and contributing to the recruitment of RNA polymerase II.
The processes of bringing RNA polymerases I and III to the DNA template involve slightly less complex collections of
transcripti
