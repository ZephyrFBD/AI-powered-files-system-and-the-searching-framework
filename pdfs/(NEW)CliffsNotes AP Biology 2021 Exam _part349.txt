gulation of Gene Expression
Although some genes, like those that code for ribosomal proteins, are always turned on, most are not. That is
because a cell is constantly modifying biochemical activities to respond to varying internal and external conditions.
In order to accomplish this feat, mechanisms exist to turn genes on and off at appropriate times.
Regulatory mechanisms in prokaryotes occur as part of operons. An operon is a unit of DNA that contains multiple
genes whose products work together to direct a single metabolic pathway. It contains the following components:
1. The promoter region is a sequence of DNA to which the RNA polymerase attaches to begin transcription.
 
2. The operator region is engaged by a regulatory protein to either block or promote the action of the RNA
polymerase.
3. The structural genes contain coding DNA, that is, DNA sequences that code for various related enzymes that
direct the production of some particular end product.
4. A regulatory gene, lying outs
