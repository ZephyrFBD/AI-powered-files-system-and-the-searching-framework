6. Jupiter is about 320 times as massive as the Earth. Thus, it
has been claimed that a person would be crushed by the
force of gravity on a planet the size of Jupiter because 
people cannot survive more than a few g’s. Calculate the
number of g’s a person would experience at Jupiter’s 
equator, using the following data for Jupiter:
equatorial
rotation
55 min. Take the centripetal acceleration into
account. [See Sections 5–2, 5–6, and 5–7.]
7. A plumb bob (a mass m hanging on a string) is deflected
from the vertical by an angle due to a massive mountain
nearby (Fig. 5–51). (a) Find an approximate formula for 
in terms of the mass of the mountain,
the distance to
its center,
and the radius and mass of the Earth.
(b) Make a rough estimate of the mass of Mt. Everest,
assuming it has the shape of a cone 4000 m high and base
of diameter 4000 m. Assume its mass per unit volume is
(c) Estimate the angle of the plumb bob
if it is 5 km from th
