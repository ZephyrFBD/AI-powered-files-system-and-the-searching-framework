ld most likely affect the activity of those enzymes. Lipase and trypsin are found in the
small intestine, so changes in the pH of the mouth and the stomach acid would not likely affect their activity.
Thus, choices (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect.
14. (C) Lipase and trypsin are found in the relatively neutral pH of the small intestine. So if the acidic contents of
the stomach were added to the small intestine in an uncontrolled manner, the pH of the small intestine would
most likely change. This would affect the activity of lipase and trypsin. Amylase is found in the mouth, so a
change in the pH of the small intestine would not affect its activity. This rules out choices (A) and (D). Choice
(B) is incorrect because pepsin is most active in the stomach and a change in the pH of the small intestine would
not affect its activity.
15. (A) Anaerobic prokaryotes do not have mitochondria nor do they have access to oxygen, so they are limited to
performing glycolysis. Choices (B), (C), and (D)
