l plant and animal species and 84 percent of marine
species became extinct, vanishing forever near the end of the Permian period. Organisms that had adapted to wet and warm
climatic conditions, such as annual rainfall of 300–400 cm (118–157 in) and 20 °C–30 °C (68 °F–86 °F) in the tropical wet
forest, may not have been able to survive the Permian climate change.

Watch this NASA video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/climate_plants) to discover the mixed effects of global warming
on plant growth. While scientists found that warmer temperatures in the 1980s and 1990s caused an increase in plant
productivity, this advantage has since been counteracted by more frequent droughts.
What impact does climate change have on plants?
a.
Warmer temperatures extend the growing season of plants, which increases their water requirement
throughout the season. Once the growing season
