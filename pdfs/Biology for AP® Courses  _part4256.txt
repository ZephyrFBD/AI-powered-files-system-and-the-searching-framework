gly increases (or decreases).
Changes in solar intensity have been proposed as one of several possible explanations for the Little Ice Age.
Finally, volcanic eruptions are a third natural driver of climate change. Volcanic eruptions can last a few days, but the solids
and gases released during an eruption can influence the climate over a period of a few years, causing short-term climate
changes. The gases and solids released by volcanic eruptions can include carbon dioxide, water vapor, sulfur dioxide,
hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide. Generally, volcanic eruptions cool the climate. This occurred in 1783
when volcanos in Iceland erupted and caused the release of large volumes of sulfuric oxide. This led to haze-effect cooling,
a global phenomenon that occurs when dust, ash, or other suspended particles block out sunlight and trigger lower global
temperatures as a result; haze-effect cooling usually extends for one or more years. In Europe and North America, haze-
