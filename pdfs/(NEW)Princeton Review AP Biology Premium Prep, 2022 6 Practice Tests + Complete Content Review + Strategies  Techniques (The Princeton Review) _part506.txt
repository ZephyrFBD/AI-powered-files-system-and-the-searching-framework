cross the cell membrane. Small
cells have a large surface area-to-volume ratio; however, as cells become larger, this ratio becomes smaller, giving
the cell relatively less surface area to exchange solutes. A cell is limited in size by the surface area-to-volume ratio.
There are many organisms that have evolved strategies for increasing surface area, like root hairs on plants and villi
in the small intestines of animals.
LAB 5: PHOTOSYNTHESIS
The chemical equation for photosynthesis is
6CO2 + 6H2O â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2
Because plants consume some of this energy during photosynthesis, measuring the oxygen produced by a plant can
tell us about the net photosynthesis that is occurring. In this laboratory, photosynthesis rates are measured by using
leaf discs that begin to float as photosynthesis is carried out, allowing you to see that photosynthesis is occurring.
There are several properties that affect the rates of photosynthesis, including:
light intensity, color, and direction
temperature
