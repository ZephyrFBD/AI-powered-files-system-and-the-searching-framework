 is in the center of the atom and contains protons and neutrons, and
the outermost region of the atom which holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus, as illustrated in Figure 2.2. Atoms
contain protons, electrons, and neutrons, among other subatomic particles. The only exception is hydrogen (H), which is
made of one proton and one electron with no neutrons.
Figure 2.2 Elements, such as helium, depicted here, are made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of protons and
neutrons located within the nucleus, with electrons in orbitals surrounding the nucleus.
Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, about 1.67 Ã— 10-24 grams. Scientists arbitrarily define this amount
of mass as one atomic mass unit (amu) or one Dalton, as shown in Table 2.2. Although similar in mass, protons and neutrons

differ in their electric charge. A proton is positively charged whereas a neutron is uncharged. Therefore, the number of
neutrons in an atom con
