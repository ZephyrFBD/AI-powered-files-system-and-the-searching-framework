as in
(C), and flagella, as in (D), are not associated with the amoeboid movement of human
white blood cells.
36. B
Â Artificial selection, as in (A), leads to changes in gene frequencies, as breeders select for
some traits over others. The presence of mutations that decrease reproductive fitness, as
in (C), will also lead to genetic change, as the new alleles are selected against over time.
Natural selection for some colors of insects over others, as in (D), will also lead to
changes in allele frequencies. In contrast, a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is
one for which allele frequencies remain constant, the complete absence of evolution. (B)
is thus correct.
37. B
Life cycles are characterized by the timing of meiosis and the characteristics of the
diploid and haploid generations. Embryonic development, (A), does not reveal either of
these characteristics, nor does the timing of fertilization, (C). All gametes are unicellular,
ruling out (D). Only (B) involves an examination
