Sample Exercise 9.8 
Bond Order
SOLUTION
Analyze We will determine the bond order for the He2
+ ion and use 
it to predict whether the ion is stable.
Plan To determine the bond order, we must determine the number 
of electrons in the molecule and how these electrons populate the 
available MOs. The valence electrons of He are in the 1s orbital, 
and the 1s orbitals combine to give an MO diagram like that for H2 
or He2 (Figure 9.33). If the bond order is greater than 0, we expect 
a bond to exist, and the ion is stable.
Solve The energy-level diagram for the He2
+
 ion is shown in  
Figure 9.34. This ion has three electrons. Two are placed in the 
bonding orbital and the third in the antibonding orbital. Thus, 
the bond order is
Bond order = 1
2 12 - 12 = 1

Because the bond order is greater than 0, we predict the He2
