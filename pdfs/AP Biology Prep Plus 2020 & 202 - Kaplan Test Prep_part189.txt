sed on the value provided by the question stem. The pressure
constant, R, is equal to 0.0831. (This value is included in the formula
sheet provided to you on Test Day.) The temperature, T, is 298 Kelvins,
based on the 25°C temperature from the question stem. Plugging in
these values results in the following: ΨS = –(2)(0.5)(0.0831)(298) = –
24.76. Thus, the value of the solute potential for the salt solution is –
24.76. Since the cell is being considered immediately aȇer being
placed in the salt solution, water has not had a chance to leave the cell
to equilibrate with its surroundings. Thus, the pressure potential is still
zero, making the water potential equal to –24.76. Therefore, the
diﬀerence in water potential is –24.76 – 0 = –24.76, or –24.8 (A), when
rounded to the nearest tenth.
(B) is the result of inputting 1 for the ionization constant. (C) is the
result of inputting 25°C for temperature. (D) is the result of making the
mistakes of both (B) and (C).
