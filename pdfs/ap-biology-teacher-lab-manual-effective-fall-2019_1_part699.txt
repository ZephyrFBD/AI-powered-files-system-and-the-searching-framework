es, might contribute to the rate of 
transpiration? 
â€¢  What structural features and/or physiological processes help plants regulate the 
amount of water lost through transpiration? How do plants maintain the balance 
between the transport of CO2 and O2 and the amount of water lost through 
transpiration? 
Students are then asked to design an experiment to investigate one or more questions, 
and their exploration will likely generate more questions about transpiration. For a 
supplemental activity, students can make thin sections of stems, identify xylem and 
phloem cells, and relate the function of these vascular tissues to observations made 
about the structure of these cells. 
The lab also provides an opportunity for students to apply, review, and/or scaffold 
concepts they have studied previously, including the relationship between cell structure 
and function, evolution of plant structures, the movement of molecules and ions across 
cell membranes, the physical and chemical proper
