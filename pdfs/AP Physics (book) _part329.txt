pring scale, once calibrated, can be used to measure other kinds of forces 
as well, such as the pulling force shown in Fig. 4–2.
A force exerted in a different direction has a different effect. Force has direc-
tion as well as magnitude, and is indeed a vector that follows the rules of vector
addition discussed in Chapter 3. We can represent any force on a diagram by an
arrow, just as we did with velocity. The direction of the arrow is the direction of the
push or pull, and its length is drawn proportional to the magnitude of the force.

CHAPTER 4
Dynamics: Newton’s Laws of Motion
†We treat everyday objects in motion here. When velocities are extremely high, close to the speed of
light 
we use the theory of relativity (Chapter 26), and in the submicroscopic world
of atoms and molecules we use quantum theory (Chapter 27 ff).
