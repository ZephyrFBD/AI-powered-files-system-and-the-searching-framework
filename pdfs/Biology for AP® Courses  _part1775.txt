Sxl is transcribed only in females (see the figure, left part). Sxl is a splicing repressor and binds to its target, the
primary RNA of the transformer (tra) gene, which undergoes differential splicing depending on the presence (female)
or absence (male) of Sxl, yielding a protein-coding tra mRNA only in females. The Tra protein binds to the primary
RNAs of doublesex (dsx) and fruitless (fru). In females, Tra promotes splicing to occur near its binding site, whereas in
males it uses an alternative, default splice site. The dsx primary RNA thus produces female-specific mRNA and male-
specific mRNA, both of which encode functional Dsx proteins, DsxF and DsxM, respectively. The presence (female)
and absence (male) of Tra similarly results in female-type fru mRNA and male-type fru mRNA, but here, only the male-
type fru mRNA encodes a functional protein.
