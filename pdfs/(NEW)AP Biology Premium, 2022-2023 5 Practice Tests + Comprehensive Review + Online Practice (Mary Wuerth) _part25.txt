oint pen to write your answer. If you make a mistake, just cross it
out with a single strikethrough—any more than that is unnecessary. If your handwriting is particularly
difficult to read, consider writing on every other line in the test booklet. Don’t worry about running out of
pages—the test booklet usually contains more blank pages than are typically needed, and the test proctor is
required to give you extra pages if you do run out of paper in the test booklet.
■DO label your graphs completely with units. If a question asks you to construct a graph, always make sure
the axes are labeled clearly with the appropriate units. A unitless graph will not earn points. Use consistent
scaling on your axes, and give your graph a title.
■DO label the parts of your answer appropriately. This makes it easier for the reader who scores your exam
to award you points. However, if you happen to answer part (a) of a question in the section you labeled (b),
the reader will still award you points for it
