With increasing age, women are at increased risk of having a baby with a chromosomal abnormality such as Down
syndrome. Why is age a risk factor?
a.
Cells are more likely to make mistakes as we age due to an increase in the nondisjunction of cells during cell
division, which is the reason for the occurrence of Down syndrome.
b.
The chance of this disorder increases with age due to increased mistakes in the mitotic cells with age.
c.
There are increased risks of translocation mutations with age, even though other mutation rates are const
