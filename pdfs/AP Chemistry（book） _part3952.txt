responds to the change in the independent variable, called the dependent variable,

is then shown along the vertical axis (y-axis). For example, consider an experiment 
in which we vary the temperature of an enclosed gas and measure its pressure. The 
independent variable is temperature and the dependent variable is pressure. The 
data shown in Table A.1 can be obtained by means of this experiment. These data are 
shown graphically in Figure A.1. The relationship between temperature and pressure is 
linear. The equation for any straight-line graph has the form
y = mx + b
where m is the slope of the line and b is the intercept with the y-axis. In the case of 
 
Figure A.1, we could say that the relationship between temperature and pressure takes the 
form
P = mT + b
where P is pressure in atm and T is temperature in °C. As shown in Figure A.1, the slope 
is 4.10 * 10-4 atm>°C, and the intercept—the point where the line crosses the
