Equations 16–4 are referred to as the electric field form of Coulomb’s law.
If we are given the electric field 
at a given point in space, then we can calcu-
late the force
on any charge q placed at that point by writing (see Eq. 16–3):
(16;5)
This is valid even if q is not small as long as q does not cause the charges creating
to move. If q is positive,
and 
point in the same direction. If q is negative,
and 
point in opposite directions. See Fig. 16–24.

This Example illustrates a general result: The electric field 
due to a positive
charge points away from the charge, whereas 
due to a negative charge points
toward that charge.
EXERCISE F Find the magnitude and direction of the electric field due to a
charge 50 cm below it.
If the electric field at a given point in space is due to more than one c
