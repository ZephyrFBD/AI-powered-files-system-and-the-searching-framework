the pulley, as well
as any friction, is small and ignorable. These assumptions ensure that the 
tension 
in the cable has the same magnitude on both sides of the pulley. Let the
mass of the counterweight be  
Assume the mass of the empty
elevator is 850 kg, and its mass when carrying four passengers is
For the latter case
calculate (a) the acceleration of the 
elevator and (b) the tension in the cable.
APPROACH Again we have two objects, and we will need to apply Newton’s
second law to each of them separately. Each mass has two forces acting on it:
gravity downward and the cable tension pulling upward,
Figures 4–23b
and c show the free-body diagrams for the elevator 
and for the counter-
weight 
The elevator, being the heavier, will accelerate downward,
whereas the counterweight will accelerate upward. The magnitudes of their
accelerations will be equal (we assume the cable is massless and doesn’t stretch).
For the counterweight,
so 
must be
greater than 9800 N (in order that
