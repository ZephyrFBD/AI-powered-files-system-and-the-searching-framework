and remains that way at temperatures above 179 °C. 
When cooled, the clear liquid turns viscous and milky at 179 °C, and the milky liquid 
solidifies at 145 °C.
Reinitzer’s work represents the first systematic report of what we call a liquid crys-
tal, the term we use today for the viscous, milky state that some substances exhibit 
between the liquid and solid states.
This intermediate phase has some of the structure of solids and some of the freedom 
of motion of liquids. Because of the partial ordering, liquid crystals may be viscous and 
possess properties intermediate between those of solids and those of liquids. The region 
in which they exhibit these properties is marked by sharp transition temperatures, as in 
Reinitzer’s sample. Just like solid, liquid, and gas phases, the liquid crystalline phase is 
represented by a distinct region on a phase diagram.
Today liquid crystals are used as pressure and temperature sensors and as liquid crys-
tals displays (LCDs) in such devices as
