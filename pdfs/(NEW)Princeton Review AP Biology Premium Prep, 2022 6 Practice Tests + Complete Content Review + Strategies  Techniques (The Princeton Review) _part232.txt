at a wavelength of 680 nanometers. The reaction center for photosystem I—P700—best absorbs light at a
wavelength of 700 nanometers.
When light energy is used to make ATP, it is called photophosphorylation. Autotrophs are using light (that’s
photo) and ADP and phosphates (that’s phosphorylation) to produce ATP.
An absorption spectrum shows how well a certain pigment absorbs electromagnetic radiation. Light absorbed is
plotted as a function of radiation wavelength. This spectrum is the opposite of an emission spectrum, which gives
information on which wavelengths are emitted by a pigment. The absorption spectrum for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll
b, and carotenoids is on the next page. You can see that chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b absorb blue and red light
quite well but do not absorb light in the green part of the spectrum. Light in the green range of wavelengths is
reflected, and this is why chlorophyll and many plants are green. Carotenoids absorb light on the blue-green end of
the
