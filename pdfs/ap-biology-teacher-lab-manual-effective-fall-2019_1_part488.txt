lls, gametes. Before you begin the 
modeling exercise, your teacher will ask you to discuss these questions. 
•  How do sexually reproducing organisms produce gametes from diploid progenitors? 
•  How does the process increase gamete diversity? 
•  What are the outcomes from independent assortment and crossing over? 
•  How does the distance between two genes or a gene and a centromere affect crossover 
frequencies?

Use the model chromosomes from Part 1 to explain meiosis and crossing-over events. 
During your investigation, answer the following questions:  
•  When is the DNA replicated during meiosis? 
•  Are homologous pairs of chromosomes exact copies of each other?  
•  What is crossing over? 
•  What physical constraints control crossover frequencies? 
•  What is meant by independent assortment? 
•  How can you calculate the possible number of different kinds of gametes?  
•  What happens if a homologous pair of chromosomes fails
