 usually taken
up by a large vacuole—the central vacuole—that crowds the other organelles. In mature plants, this vacuole
contains the cell sap. A full vacuole in a plant is a sign that it is not dehydrated. Dehydrated plants cannot fill their
vacuoles and they wilt. Plant cells also differ from animal cells in that plant cells do not contain centrioles.
Why do we need to know about the structure of cells? Because biological structure is often closely related to
function. To help you remember the differences among prokaryotes, plant cells, and animal cells, we’ve put together
a simple table (on the next page).
Make sure you learn these differences, as the AP Biology Exam almost always
has a question about cellular structures.
Transport: Traffic Across Membranes
We’ve talked about the structure of cell membranes; now let’s discuss how molecules and fluids pass through the
plasma membrane. What are some of the patterns of membrane transport? The ability of molecules to move across
