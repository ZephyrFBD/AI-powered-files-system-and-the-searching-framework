s law, which states that the partial pressure 
exerted by solvent vapor above the solution, P
solution, equals the product of the mole frac-
tion of the solvent, Xsolvent, times the vapor pressure of the pure solvent, P°

For example, the vapor pressure of pure water at 20 °C is P°
H2O = 17.5 torr. Imagine 
holding the temperature constant while adding glucose 1C6H12O62 to the water so that 
the mole fractions in the resulting solution are XH2O = 0.800 and XC6H12O6 = 0.200.
