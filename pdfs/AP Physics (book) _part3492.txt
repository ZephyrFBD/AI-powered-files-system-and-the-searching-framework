Large doses of radiation can cause unpleasant symptoms such as nausea,
fatigue, and loss of body hair, because of cellular damage. Such effects are some-
times referred to as radiation sickness. Very large doses can be fatal, although the
time span of the dose is important. A brief dose of 10 Sv (1000 rem) is nearly
always fatal. A 3-Sv (300-rem) dose in a short period of time is fatal in about 
50% of patients within a month. However, the body possesses remarkable repair
processes, so that a 3-Sv dose spread over several weeks is usually not fatal. It
will, nonetheless, cause considerable damage to the body.
The effects of low doses over a long time are difficult to determine and are
not well known as yet.
