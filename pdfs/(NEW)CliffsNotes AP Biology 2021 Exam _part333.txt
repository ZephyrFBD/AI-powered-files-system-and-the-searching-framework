a prelude to the details, note the following:
 
1. As in transcription, translation is categorized into three steps— initiation, elongation, and termination.
2. Energy for translation is provided by several GTP (guanosine triphosphate) molecules. GTP acts as an energy
supplier in the same manner as ATP.
3. A ribosome has three binding sites for tRNA molecules arranged in a series:
 
The A site (for amino acid or “acceptor”), in the first position, accepts an incoming tRNA carrying an amino acid.
The amino acid is passed on to the tRNA in the second position.
The P site (for polypeptide), in the second position, holds the tRNA with a growing chain of amino acids
(polypeptide).
The E site (for exit), in the third position, holds the tRNA after it gives up its amino acid.
The details of translation follow, with numbers corresponding to events illustrated in Figure 9-6:
 
1. Initiation begins when the small ribosomal subunit attaches near the end of the mRNA.
 
2. A tRNA (with anticodon UA
