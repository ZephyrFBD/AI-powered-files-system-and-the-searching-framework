We will see examples of the usefulness of ∆G throughout the remain-
der of this chapter and this text.
When ﬁrst learning about ∆G, two common questions often 
arise: Why is the sign of ∆G an indicator of the spontaneity of reac-
tions? And what is “free” about free energy?
In Section 19.2, we saw that the second law of thermodynamics 
governs the spontaneity of processes. In order to apply the second 
law (Equation 19.4), however, we must determine ∆Suniv, which is 
often difficult to evaluate. When T and P are constant, however, 
we can relate ∆Suniv to the changes in entropy and enthalpy of just 
the system by substituting the Equation 19.9 expression for ∆Ssurr in 
Equation 19.4:
∆Suniv = ∆Ssys + ∆Ssurr = ∆Ssys + a

Thus, at constant temperature and pressure, the second law becomes
