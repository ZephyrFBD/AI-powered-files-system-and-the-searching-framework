tial of the 0.1 molar sodium chloride solution.
(c) There would be no effect on the dandelion cells because they would be open to the atmosphere and have a
pressure potential of zero.
(d) Water would flow into the dandelion cells because the water potential in the dandelion cells would be
lower than the water potential of the 0.1 molar sodium chloride solution.

11. The paramecium Paramecium aurelia has a contractile vacuole, which it uses to pump excess water out of its
cell. P. aurelia was placed in four different salt solutions with concentrations of 0.02 molar, 0.04 molar, 0.08
molar, and 0.10 molar salt. The number of contractions of the contractile vacuole per minute was measured
over a 10-minute period.
(a) Describe how the water potential of the surrounding solutions would affect the rate of contraction of the
contractile vacuole.
(b) Identify the independent variable and dependent variable in this experiment.
(c) As a follow-up experiment, P. aurelia is plac
