. Because the force of static
friction can vary from zero to this maximum value, we write
[static friction]
You may have noticed that it is often easier to keep a heavy object sliding
than it is to start it sliding in the first place. This is consistent with 
generally
being greater than 
(see Table 4–2).
Friction: static and kinetic. Our 10.0-kg mystery box rests
on a horizontal floor. The coefficient of static friction is  
and the 
coefficient of kinetic friction is 
Determine the force of friction,
acting on the box if a horizontal applied force 
is exerted on it of magnitude:
(a) 0, (b) 10 N, (c) 20 N, (d) 38 N, and (e) 40 N.
APPROACH We don’t know, right off, if we are dealing with static friction or
kinetic friction, nor if the box remains at rest or accelerates. We need to draw a
free-body diagram, and then determine in each case whether or not the box will
move: the box starts moving if 
is greater than the maximum static friction
force (Newton’s second law). The forces on the
