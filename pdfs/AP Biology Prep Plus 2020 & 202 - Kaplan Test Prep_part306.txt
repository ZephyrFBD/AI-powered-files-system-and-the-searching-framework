ular process) may be stimulatory or
inhibitory. Stimulatory responses typically involve activators or growth
factors that promote gene expression, cell growth, and cell proliferation,
whereas inhibitory responses involve inhibitors that may block signals
from one molecule to another and/or lower enzyme activity. Epinephrine,
also known as adrenaline, is an example that elicits both stimulatory and
inhibitory responses. Epinephrine not only activates glycogen
breakdown, but it also inhibits the enzyme that catalyzes glycogen
synthesis. Another example is apoptosis. In a normal cell, apoptosis is
prevented by inhibiting the expression of pro-apoptotic factors and by
promoting the expression of anti-apoptotic factors. However, when DNA
damage is beyond repair, the cell signals apoptosis to occur.Â 
Selective pressures such as predators, diseases, and environmental
threats also impact which signaling pathway that cells within an
organism choose. If the selective pressure is neutral, the pre
