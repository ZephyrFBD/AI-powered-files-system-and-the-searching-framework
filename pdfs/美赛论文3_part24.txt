2.2.7 Problem solving
2.2.7.1 Analysis of process
(1) The process of cooling
This step refers to: Firstly, add water into the bathtub until the bathtub is full.
Secondly, start to have a bath until the temperature reaches the predesigned water
temperature
2
u . This period of time is
0
t .
(2) The Process of Looping
This part is a process of cycle. The first step is the three stages of adding water
into the bathtub. The moment the user stop adding water, the fusion of water starts
until the temperature becomes even. The final step is to take the bath until the water
temperature drops to
2
u .
2.2.7.2 Analysis of model
Assuming that
2
n 
, which means adding water twice, the whole process needs
to go through the loop twice.
First step is the process of cooling, which lasts for
0
t . In the end, the water’s
temperature in the bathtub is
2
u . Then it goes through the loop twice. The whole
process can be divided into th
