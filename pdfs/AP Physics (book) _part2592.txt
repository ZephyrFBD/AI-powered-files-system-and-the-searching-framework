and the focal length f, is given by the thin lens equation:
(23;8)
The ratio of image height to object height, which equals
the magnification m for a lens, is
(23;9)
When using the various equations of geometric optics, you
must remember the sign conventions for all quantities involved:
carefully review them (pages 655 and 665) when doing Problems.
[*When two (or more) thin lenses are used in combination
to produce an image, the thin lens equation can be used for each
lens in sequence. The image produced by the first lens acts as
the object for the second lens.]
[*The lensmaker’s equation relates the radii of curvature
of the lens surfaces and the lens’ index of refraction to the focal
length of the lens.]
