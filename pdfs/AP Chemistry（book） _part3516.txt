on states, the halogens tend to be good oxidizing agents, readily 
accepting electrons.
Chlorine, bromine, and iodine are found as the halides in seawater and in salt depos-
its. Fluorine occurs in the minerals fluorspar 1CaF22, cryolite 1Na3AlF62, and fluorapatite 
3Ca51PO423F4.* Only fluorspar is an important commercial source of fluorine.
All isotopes of astatine are radioactive. The longest-lived isotope is astatine-210, 
which has a half-life of 8.1 h and decays mainly by electron capture. Because astatine is so 
unstable, very little is known about its chemistry.
Properties and Production of the Halogens
Most properties of the halogens vary in a regular fashion as we go from fluorine to iodine 
(Table 22.2).
Under ordinary conditions the halogens exist as diatomic molecules. The molecules 
are held together in the solid and liquid states by dispersion forces.

Because I2 is the largest and most polarizable halogen molecule, the intermolecular forces 
between I2 m
