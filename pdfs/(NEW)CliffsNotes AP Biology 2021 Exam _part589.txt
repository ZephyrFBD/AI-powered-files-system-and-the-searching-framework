en it moves down the
collecting duct.
16. B. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), produced by the posterior pituitary, increases reabsorption of water in the
kidneys, making urine more concentrated.
17. C. Although the pancreas supplies digestive enzymes to the small intestine (specifically, the duodenum of the
small intestine), no digestion actually takes place in the pancreas.
18. C. Pepsin splits proteins into polypeptides in the stomach. Trypsin digests proteins in the small intestine.
Secretin is a hormone(not an enzyme) that stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes into the intestine. Bile
emulsifies fats, not digests them. Another hormone, gastrin, stimulates the secretion of pepsin and other gastric
juices into the stomach.
19. B. Hormone receptors in certain target cells initiate cellular responses to hormones when cAMP triggers the
activity of specific enzymes. cAMP is not involved in muscle contraction.
20. A. The order of events during muscle contraction is: ATP binds to myosi
