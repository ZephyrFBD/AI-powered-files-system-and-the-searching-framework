Think About It
New drugs are being developed that decrease DNA methylation and prevent the removal of acetyl groups from histone
proteins. Explain how these drugs could affect gene expression to help kill tumor cells.
How can understanding the gene expression in a cancer cell tell you something about that specific form of cancer?
