Fibrous Joints
The bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue. There is no cavity, or space, present between
the bones and so most fibrous joints do not move at all, or are only capable of minor movements. There are three types
of fibrous joints: sutures, syndesmoses, and gomphoses. Sutures are found only in the skull and possess short fibers of
connective tissue that hold the skull bones tightly in place (Figure 29.23).

Figure 29.23 Sutures are fibrous joints found only in the skull.
Syndesmoses are joints in which the bones are connected by a band of connective tissue, allowing for more movement
than in a suture. An example of a syndesmosis is the joint of the tibia and fibula in the ankle. The amount of movement in
these types of joints is determined by the length of th
