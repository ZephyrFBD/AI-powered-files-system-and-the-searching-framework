d the M phase lasts approximately one-half hour. In early embryos of fruit flies, the
cell cycle is completed in about eight minutes. The timing of events in the cell cycle is controlled by mechanisms that are
both internal and external to the cell.
Regulation of the Cell Cycle by External Events
Both the initiation and inhibition of cell division are triggered by events external to the cell when it is about to begin the
replication process. An event may be as simple as the death of a nearby cell or as sweeping as the release of growth-
promoting hormones, such as human growth hormone (HGH). A lack of HGH can inhibit cell division, resulting in
dwarfism, whereas too much HGH can result in gigantism. Crowding of cells can also inhibit cell division. Another factor
that can initiate cell division is the size of the cell; as a cell grows, it becomes inefficient due to its decreasing surface-to-
volume ratio. The solution to this problem is to divide.
