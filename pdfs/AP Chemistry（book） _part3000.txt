ometimes these processes are referred to as being thermodynamically reversible or thermo-
dynamically irreversible to add greater clarity to their meanings.

If the flow of heat into or out of the system is to be reversible, what must 
be true of dT?

▲ Figure 19.3 Reversible flow of heat. Heat can flow reversibly between a system and its surroundings  
only if the two have an infinitesimally small difference in temperature dT. (a) Increasing the temperature  
of the system by dT causes heat to flow from the hotter system to the colder surroundings. (b) Decreasing  
the temperature of the system by dT causes heat to flow from the hotter surroundings to the colder system.
