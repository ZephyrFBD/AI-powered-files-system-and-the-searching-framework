 the principle of induction. In one form, a microphone is just the inverse of a loud-
speaker (Section 20–10). A small coil connected to a membrane is suspended close
to a small permanent magnet, as shown in Fig.21–31. The coil moves in the magnetic
field when sound waves strike the membrane, and this motion induces an emf in
the moving coil. The frequency of the induced emf will be just that of the impinging
sound waves, and this emf is the “signal” that can be amplified and sent to 
loudspeakers or recorder.
Credit Card Reader
When you pass a credit card through a reader at a store, the magnetic stripe on 
the back of the card passes over a read head just as for a computer hard 
drive. The magnetic stripe contains personal information about your account 
and connects by telephone line for approval from your credit card company.
Newer cards use semiconductor chips that are more difficult to fraudulently
copy.
