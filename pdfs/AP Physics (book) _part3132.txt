is not simply a particle). Similarly, the
energy can be uncertain (or nonconserved) by an amount 
for a time
Because Planck’s constant, h, is so small, the uncertainties expressed in the
uncertainty principle are usually negligible on the macroscopic level. But at the
level of atomic sizes, the uncertainties are significant. Because we consider
ordinary objects to be made up of atoms containing nuclei and electrons, the
uncertainty principle is relevant to our understanding of all of nature. The
uncertainty principle expresses, perhaps most clearly, the probabilistic nature of
quantum mechanics. It thus is often used as a basis for philosophic discussion.
