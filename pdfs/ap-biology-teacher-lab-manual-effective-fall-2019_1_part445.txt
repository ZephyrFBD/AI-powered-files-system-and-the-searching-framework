mework or as a group activity. 
•  What is your experimental hypothesis? Your null hypothesis? Are these the same? 
•  How would you design an experiment with onion bulbs to test whether lectins  
increase the number of cells in mitosis?  
•  What would you measure, and how would you measure it? 
•  What would be an appropriate control for your experiment? 
Notes about the lectin: Phytohemagglutinin (PHA-M) is a lectin; a lectin is a protein 
that binds to specific carbohydrates. PHA-M induces mitosis (acts as a mitogen) in 
cultured T-lymphocytes by binding to the T-cell receptor for antigen (part of the Ti-C3 
complex). This causes an intracellular signal involving Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic 
reticulum, ultimately causing cell replication.
