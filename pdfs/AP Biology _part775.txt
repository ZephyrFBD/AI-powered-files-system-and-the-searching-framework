injection with Ca++. The development of an unfertilized egg is called
parthenogenesis. The adult that results is haploid. Drone honeybees
develop by natural parthenogenesis from unfertilized eggs and are haploid
males.
EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT
Embryonic development is characterized by exquisite timing and
coordination of many different events. Many genes are silenced by
microRNAs (miRNA), while others are “turned on.” Programmed cell
death (apoptosis) removes cells that would impede the proper
development of others.
Embryonic 
development 
consists 
of 
three 
stages: 
cleavage,
gastrulation, and organogenesis. The stages that are discussed below
generally describe the development of all animal eggs but are typical of the
sea urchin that has almost no yolk. In eggs with more yolk, such as those
of the frog, cleavage is unequal, with very little cell division in the yolky
region. In eggs with a great deal of yolk, such as a bird egg, cleavage is
limited to a small, nonyolky disc at the t
