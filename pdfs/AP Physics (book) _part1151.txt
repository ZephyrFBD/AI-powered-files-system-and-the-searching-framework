 back and
forth, so its velocity can be either in the 
or 
direction, but its magnitude
depends only on its position x.
Doubling the amplitude. Suppose the
spring in Fig. 11–5 is stretched twice as far (to 
). What happens to 
(a) the energy of the system, (b) the maximum velocity of the oscillating mass,
(c) the maximum acceleration of the mass?
RESPONSE (a) From Eq. 11–4a, the total energy is proportional to the square
of the amplitude A, so stretching it twice as far quadruples the energy
You may protest, “I did work stretching the spring from 
to 
Don’t I do the same work stretching it from A to 2A?” No. The force you exert
is proportional to the displacement x, so for the second displacement, from
to 2A, you do more work than for the first displacement (
to A).
(b) From Eq. 11–5a, we can see that when the amplitude is doubled, the maxi-
mum velocity must be doubled.
(c) Since the force is twice as great when we stretch the spring twice as far 
the acceleration is also twice as gre
