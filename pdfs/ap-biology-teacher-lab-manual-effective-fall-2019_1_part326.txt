These three blocks will be your models for cells. 
•  What is the surface area of each of your three cells? 
•  What is the total volume of each of your cells? 
•  If you put each of the blocks into a solution, into which block would that solution 
diffuse throughout the entire block fastest? Slowest? How do you explain the 
difference? 
■ Alternative Method 
Mix one packet of unflavored gelatin with 237 mL of water: add 2.5 mL 1% 
phenolphthalein and a few drops of 0.1 M NaOH. The solution should be bright pink. 
Pour the gelatin mixture into shallow pans and refrigerate overnight. 
You may use white vinegar in place of the 0.1 M HCl. 
■ Designing and Conducting Your Investigation 
Using the materials listed earlier, design an experiment to test the predictions you just 
made regarding the relationship of surface area and volume in the artificial cells to the 
diffusion rate using the phenolphthalein–NaOH agar and the HCl solution. Once you 
have finished planning your experiment, hav
