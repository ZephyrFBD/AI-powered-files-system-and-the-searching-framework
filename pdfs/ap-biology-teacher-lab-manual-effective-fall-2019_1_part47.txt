 it is plugged again.
An additional technique to avoid the problem of flies escaping is to refrigerate them 
before the transfer. If vials are chilled for at least 15–30 minutes before tossing, they 
are easier to transfer. Be sure that the chilling does not add moisture to the culture, as 
moisture can make the flies stick to the vials.
Students may have the misconception that fruit flies are attracted to fruit, but they 
will determine that it is not the fruit but rather the rotting fruit and the accompanying 
chemotaxis to various products, such as vinegar or alcohol, of this decomposition 
process that prompts the fly’s behavior. How can you help students identify the difference 
without telling them? Is the chemotaxis a strong taxis? Does a geotaxis or phototaxis 
override the chemotaxis?
