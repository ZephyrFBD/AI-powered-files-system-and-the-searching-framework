er.
SOLUTION Since the mass of the 
is 4.002603 u (Appendix B), the total
mass in the final state 
is
The mass lost when the 
decays 
is
Because
the energy Q released is
and this energy appears as kinetic energy of the 
particle and the daughter
nucleus.
Additional Example
Kinetic energy of the 
in 
decay. For the 
decay
of Example 30–6, how much of the 5.4-MeV disintegration energy will be carried
off by the 
particle?
APPROACH In any reaction, momentum must be conserved as well as energy.
SOLUTION Before disintegration, the nucleus can be assumed to be at rest, so
the total momentum was zero. After disintegration, the total vector momentum
must still be zero so the magnitude of the 
particle’s momentum must equal
the magnitude of the daughter’s momentum (Fig. 30–6):
Thus 
and the 
kinetic energy is
The total disintegration energy is
Hence
The lighter 
particle carries off (57 58) or 98% of the total kinetic energy. The
total energy released is 5.4 MeV, so the daughter nucleus, which
