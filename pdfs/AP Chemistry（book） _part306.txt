 formulas? As we will see in Chapter 3, certain 
common methods of analyzing substances lead to the empirical formula only. For exam-
ple, if you decomposed hydrogen peroxide H2O2 into its elements and weighed them, you 
could determine that there were equal numbers of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, but you 
would not know if the molecular formula was HO, H2O2, H3O3, or the like. Once the empir-
ical formula is known, additional experiments can give the information needed to convert 
the empirical formula to the molecular one. In addition, there are many substances that 
do not exist as isolated molecules, one example being ionic compounds that are discussed 
later in this chapter. For these substances, we must rely on empirical formulas.
Picturing Molecules
The molecular formula of a substance does not show how its atoms are joined together. 
A structural formula is needed to convey that information, as in the following 
examples:
Hydrogen peroxide
Water
Methane
H
