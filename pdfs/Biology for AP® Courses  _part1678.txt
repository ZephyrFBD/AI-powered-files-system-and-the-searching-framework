A lack of protein in the diet can cause hair loss. Explain why this occurs.
a.
Due to lack of protein in the diet, our body will not be able to form other proteins; thus, it will conserve the
protein it has for critical use, leading to hair loss.
b.
Lack of protein in the diet can weaken the immune system, thus leading to hair loss.
c.
Due to lack of protein in the diet, energy will be lost, thus leading to hair loss.
d.
Lack of protein in the diet will lead to breakage of disulfide bonds between proteins, thus leading to hair loss.
Ribosomes
Even before an mRNA is translated, a cell must invest energy to build each of its ribosomes. In E. col
