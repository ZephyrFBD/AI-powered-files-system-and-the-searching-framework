human hair, keratin, is composed mostly of alpha helixes, while silk and
spider webs consist of proteins made of beta-pleated sheets.
Tertiary structure is the intricate three-dimensional shape or
conformation of a protein that is superimposed on its secondary structure.
Tertiary structure determines the protein’s specificity. The following
intramolecular factors contribute to the tertiary structure:
Hydrogen bonding between R groups of amino acids
Ionic bonding between R groups
Hydrophobic interactions
Van der Waals interactions

Disulfide bonds between cysteine amino acids
Quaternary structure refers to proteins that consist of more than one
polypeptide chain. Hemoglobin exhibits quaternary structure because it
consists of four polypeptide chains, each one forming a heme group.
PROTEIN FOLDING
Under normal cellular conditions, the primary structure of a protein
determines how it folds into its particular three-dimensional shap
