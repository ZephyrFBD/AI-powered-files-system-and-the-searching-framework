ly and magnetically:
… these … invisible electromagnetic waves strike a human retina, and if (and only if) the
waves happen to measure between 400 and 700 nano meters in length from crest to crest,
then their energy is just right to deliver a stimulus to the 8 million cone-shaped cells in the
retina.
Each in turn send an electrical pulse to a neighbour neuron, and on up the line this goes, at
250 mph, until it reaches the … occipital lobe of the brain, in the back of the head. There, a
cascading complex of neurons fire from the incoming stimuli, and we subjectively perceive
this experience as a yellow brightness occurring in a place we have been conditioned to call
the ‘external world’.
You hear what you decode
If a tree falls or a building collapses they make no noise unless
someone is there to decode the energetic waves generated by the
disturbance into what we call sound. Does a falling tree make a
noise? Only if you hear it – decode it. Everything in our reality is a
frequency ﬁeld
