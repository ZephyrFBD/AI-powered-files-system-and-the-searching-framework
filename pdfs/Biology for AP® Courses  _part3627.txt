id (H2CO3). Carbonic acid is an unstable intermediate molecule
that immediately dissociates into bicarbonate ions (HCO3
âˆ’) and hydrogen (H+) ions. Since carbon dioxide is quickly
converted into bicarbonate ions, this reaction allows for the continued uptake of carbon dioxide into the blood down its
concentration gradient. It also results in the production of H+ ions. If too much H+ is produced, it can alter blood pH.
However, hemoglobin binds to the free H+ ions and thus limits shifts in pH. The newly synthesized bicarbonate ion is
transported out of the red blood cell into the liquid component of the blood in exchange for a chloride ion (Cl-); this is
called the chloride shift. When the blood reaches the lungs, the bicarbonate ion is transported back into the red blood cell in
exchange for the chloride ion. The H+ ion dissociates from the hemoglobin and binds to the bicarbonate ion. This produces
the carbonic acid intermediate, which is converted back into carbon dioxide through the e
