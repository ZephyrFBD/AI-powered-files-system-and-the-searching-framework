34. (II) What is the temperature inside an ideal refrigerator-
freezer that operates with a
in a 22°C room?
35. (II) A heat pump is used to keep a house warm at 22°C.
How much work is required of the pump to deliver 3100 J
of heat into the house if the outdoor temperature is 
(a) 0°C, (b) 
Assume a COP of 3.0. (c) Redo for
both temperatures, assuming an ideal (Carnot) coefficient
of performance
36. (II) (a) What is the coefficient of performance of an ideal
heat pump that extracts heat from 6°C air outside and
deposits heat inside a house at 24°C? (b) If this heat pump
operates on 1200 W of electrical power, what is the maximum
heat it can deliver into the house each hour? See Problem 35.
37. (II) What volume of water at 0°C can a freezer make into
ice cubes in 1.0 h, if the coefficient of performance of the
cooling unit is 6.0 and the power input is 1.2 kilowatt?
38. (II) How much less per year would it cost a family to operate
a heat pump that has a coefficient of performance of 2
