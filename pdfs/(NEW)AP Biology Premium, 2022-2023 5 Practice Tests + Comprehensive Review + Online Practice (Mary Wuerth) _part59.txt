used on raw data, such as the numbers of individuals in each
category. The values used in the chi-square table have been calculated by statisticians and are designed to be
used with raw data. Processed data, such as means and percentages, cannot be used with the chi-square test,
making choices (A), (B), and (C) incorrect.
4. (C) Since there are four different phenotypes that could be produced, there are 3 degrees of freedom. Degrees
of freedom = number of possible outcomes in the experiment – 1 = 4 – 1 = 3.
5. (D)
. Using the observed and expected values in the problem: 
. There are two possible outcomes in the experiment (tall or dwarf), so
the degrees of freedom = 2 – 1 = 1. Using the p-value of 0.05 and the chi-square table, the critical value is 3.84.
The calculated chi-square value from the data is less than the critical value, so there is likely no statistically
significant difference between the observed data and the expected data. Choices (A) and (B) are incorrect
because they
