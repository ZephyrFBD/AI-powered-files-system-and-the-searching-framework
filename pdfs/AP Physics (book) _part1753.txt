le investigate the electric field surrounding a charge or
group of charges by measuring the force on a small positive test charge which is
at rest. By a test charge we mean a charge so small that the force it exerts does
not significantly affect the charges that create the field. If a tiny positive test
charge q is placed at various locations in the vicinity of a single positive charge Q
as shown in Fig. 16–23 (points A, B, C), the force exerted on q is as shown. The
force at B is less than at A because B’s distance from Q is greater (Coulomb’s
law); and the force at C is smaller still. In each case, the force on q is directed
radially away from Q. The electric field is defined in terms of the force on such a
positive test charge. In particular, the electric field,
at any point in space is
defined as the force 
exerted on a tiny positive test charge placed at that point
divided by the magnitude of the test charge q:

More precisely,
