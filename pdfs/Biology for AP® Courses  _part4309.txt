59. In a temperate grassland system area of North
America, vegetation has been destroyed by fire. What will
happen to the net primary productivity and the local
ecosystem when rains return in the next season?
a.
The grasses will grow back, but the herbivores
that lived there will not return, as they would
have found new land to live on. Therefore, the
net primary productivity would decrease.
b.
The grasses will not grow back, therefore the
herbivores that lived there will not return. Thus,
the net primary productivity would decrease.
c.
The grasses will grow back and the herbivores
that lived there will return. The net primary
productivity should also be similar to the
previous season.
d.
The grasses will grow back and the herbivores
that lived there will return. The net primary
productivity would be less than the previous
season.
