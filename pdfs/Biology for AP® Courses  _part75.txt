alsifiable, meaning that it can be disproven by experimental
results. Importantly, science does not claim to “prove” anything because scientific understandings are always subject to
modification with further information. This step—openness to disproving ideas—is what distinguishes sciences from non-
sciences. The presence of the supernatural, for instance, is neither testable nor falsifiable. To test a hypothesis, a researcher
will conduct one or more experiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. Each experiment will have one
or more variables and one or more controls. A variable is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the
experiment. The control group contains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation
that is hypothesized about. Therefore, if the results of the experimental group differ from the control group, the difference
must be due to the hypothesized manipulation, rather than some outside factor. Look
