Advantages
Disadvantages
Fossil-fuel steam plants: burn coal,
oil, or natural gas to boil water,
producing high-pressure steam that
turns a turbine of a generator 
(Figs. 15–12b, 15–21); uses heat
engine.
Nuclear energy:
Fission: nuclei of uranium or
plutonium atoms split (“fission”)
with release of energy (Chapter 31)
that heats steam; uses heat engine.
Fusion: energy released when
isotopes of hydrogen (or other
small nuclei) combine or “fuse”
(Chapter 31).
Hydroelectric:
falling water 
turns turbines at 
the base of a 
dam.
Geothermal: natural steam from
inside the Earth comes to the
surface (hot springs, geysers, steam
vents); or cold water passed down
into contact with hot, dry rock is
heated to steam.
Wind power:
3-kW to 5-MW 
windmills (vanes 
up to 50 m long)
