2.2.3 Compound Interest Rate 
Exponential functions occur in calculating compound interest. If an amount of money P, 
called the principal, is invested at an interest rate i per time period, then after one time 
period the interest is P i, and the amount A of money is 
A = P + P i = P(1 + i) 
If the interest is reinvested, then the new principal is P(1 + i), and the amount after another 
time period is

r = interest rate per year 
n = number of times interest is compounded per year
