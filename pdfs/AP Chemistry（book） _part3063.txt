difference in free energy between reactants and products.
A listing of standard free energies of formation is given in Appendix C.

Give It Some Thought
What does the superscript ° indicate when associated with a thermodynamic 
quantity, as in ∆H °, ∆S°, or ∆G°?
Standard free energies of formation are useful in calculating the standard free- 
energy change for chemical processes. The procedure is analogous to the calculation of 
∆H° (Equation 5.31) and ∆S° (Equation 19.8):
 
∆G° = a n∆Gf°1products2 - a m∆Gf°1reactants2
