ly is calculated by measuring 
the consumption of carbon dioxide, but this requires expensive equipment and complex 
procedures. Students are asked to consider variables that might affect the rate of 
photosynthesis and the floating disk procedure itself. A number of questions emerge 
about the process that leads to independent student investigations. The investigation also 
provides an opportunity for students to apply concepts that they have studied previously, 
including enzymatic activity, cell structure and function (big idea 4), and the evolution 
of conserved core processes in plants (big idea 1).
 Investigation 6: Cellular Respiration  is a revision of Laboratory 5 (Cell 
Respiration) in the 2001 AP Biology Laboratory Manual and reflects the shift toward 
more student-directed and inquiry-based laboratory experiences as students explore 
factors that might affect the rate of cellular respiration in multicellular organisms.
