er, thereby increasing solubility. Glucose (C6H12O6, Figure 13.10) has five 
OH groups on a six-carbon framework, which makes the molecule very soluble in 
water: 830 g dissolves in 1.00 L of water at 17.5 °C. In contrast, cyclohexane 1C6H122, 
which has a similar structure to glucose but with all of the OH groups replaced by H, 
is essentially insoluble in water (only 55 mg of cyclohexane can dissolve in 1.00 L of 
water at 25 °C).
Over years of study, examination of different solvent–solute combinations has led to 
an important generalization:
 
Substances with similar intermolecular attractive forces tend to be  
soluble in one another.
