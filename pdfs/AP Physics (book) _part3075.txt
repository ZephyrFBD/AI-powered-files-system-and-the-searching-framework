circle. The circular wave, on the other hand, represents the
amplitude of the electron “matter wave,” and in Fig. 27–31 the wave amplitude 
is shown superimposed on the circular path of the particle orbit for convenience.
Bohr’s theory worked well for hydrogen and for one-electron ions. But it did
not prove successful for multi-electron atoms. Bohr theory could not predict line
spectra even for the next simplest atom, helium. It could not explain why some emis-
sion lines are brighter than others, nor why some lines are split into two or more
closely spaced lines (“fine structure”). A new theory was needed and was indeed
developed in the 1920s. This new and radical theory is called quantum mechanics.
It finally solved the problem of atomic structure, but it gives us a very different
view of the atom: the idea of electrons in well-defined orbits was replaced with the
idea of electron “clouds.” This new theory of quantum mechanics has given us a
wholly different view of the basic mechani
