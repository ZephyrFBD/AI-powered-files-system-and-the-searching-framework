s because of the ubiquitous presence of 
O2, a good oxidizing agent.
The information contained in Table 20.1 is summarized graphically in Figure 20.11. 
For the half-reactions at the top of Table 20.1 the substances on the reactant side of the 
equation are the most readily reduced species in the table and are therefore the strongest 
oxidizing agents. Substances on the product side of these reactions are the most difficult 
to oxidize and so are the weakest reducing agents in the table. Thus, Figure 20.11 shows 
F21g2 as the strongest oxidizing agent and F-1aq2 as the weakest reducing agent. Con-
versely, the reactants in half-reactions at the bottom of Table 20.1, such as Li+1aq2 are the 
most difficult to reduce and so are the weakest oxidizing agents, while the products of 
these reactions, such as Li(s), are the most readily oxidized species in the table and so are 
the strongest reducing agents.
This inverse relationship between oxidizing and reducing strength is similar to the
