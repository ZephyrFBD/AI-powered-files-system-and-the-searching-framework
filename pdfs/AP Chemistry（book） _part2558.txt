 percent ionization of the acid.
Plan The percent ionization is given by Equation 16.27.

0.10 M
* 100% = 4.2%
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
A 0.077 M solution of an acid HA has pH = 2.16. What is 
the percentage of the acid that is ionized?
(a) 0.090% (b) 0.69% (c) 0.90% (d) 3.6% (e) 9.0%
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
A 0.020 M solution of niacin (see Sample Exercise 16.10) has 
a pH of 3.26. Calculate the percent ionization of the niacin.
Using Ka to Calculate ph
Knowing the value of Ka and the initial concentration of a weak acid, we can calculate 
the concentration of H+1aq2 in a solution of the acid.
How to Calculate pH Using Ka
 
1. Write the ionization equilibrium.
 
2. Write the equilibrium-constant expression and the value for the equilibrium 
constant.
 
3. Express the concentrations involved in the equilibrium reaction.
 
4. Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium-constant expres-
