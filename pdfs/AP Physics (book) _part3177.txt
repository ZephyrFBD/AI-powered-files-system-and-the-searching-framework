ght source, on the other hand, emits light in all directions (so the
intensity decreases rapidly with distance), and the emitted light is incoherent (the
different parts of the beam are not in phase with each other). The excited atoms that
emit the light in an ordinary lightbulb act independently, so each photon emitted
can be considered as a short wave train lasting about 
Different wave trains
bear no phase relation to one another. Just the opposite is true of lasers.
The action of a laser is based on quantum theory. We have seen that a photon
can be absorbed by an atom if (and only if) the photon energy hf corresponds to
the energy difference between an occupied energy level of the atom and an avail-
able excited state, Fig. 28â€“16a. If the atom is already in the excited state, it may
jump down spontaneously (i.e., no stimulus) to the lower state with the emission
of a photon. However, if a photon with this same energy strikes the excited 
atom, it can stimulate the atom to make the
