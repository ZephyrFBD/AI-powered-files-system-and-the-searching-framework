5;8 Kepler’s Laws
57. (I) Neptune is an average distance of
from the
Sun. Estimate the length of the Neptunian year using the
fact that the Earth is
from the Sun on average.
58. (I) The asteroid Icarus, though only a few hundred meters
across, orbits the Sun like the planets. Its period is 410 d.
What is its mean distance from the Sun?
59. (I) Use Kepler’s laws and the period of the Moon (27.4 d)
to determine the period of an artificial satellite orbiting
very near the Earth’s surface.
60. (II) Determine the mass of the Earth from the known
period and
