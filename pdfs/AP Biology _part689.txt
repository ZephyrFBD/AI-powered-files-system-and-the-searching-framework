example, the pressure of
the baby’s head against sensors near the opening of the uterus stimulates
more uterine contractions, which causes increased pressure against the
uterine opening, which causes yet more contractions. This positive
feedback loop brings labor to an end and the birth of a baby. This is very
different from negative feedback. Negative feedback is a common
mechanism in the endocrine system (and elsewhere) that maintains
homeostasis. A good example is how the body maintains proper levels of
thyroxine. When the level of thyroxine in the blood is too low, the
hypothalamus releases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which
stimulates the anterior pituitary to release a hormone, thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH), which stimulates the thyroid to release more thyroxine.
Thyroxine exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamus and the anterior
pituitary. When the level of thyroxine is adequate, the hypothalamus stops
stimulating the pituitary. (See “Positive and Negative Feedba
