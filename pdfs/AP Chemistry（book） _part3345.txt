Nuclides that are radioactive are called radionuclides, and atoms containing these 
nuclei are called radioisotopes.
Nuclear Equations
Most nuclei in nature are stable and remain intact indefinitely. Radionuclides, however, 
are unstable and spontaneously emit particles and electromagnetic radiation. Emis-
sion of radiation is one of the ways in which an unstable nucleus is transformed into a 
more stable one that has less energy. The emitted radiation is the carrier of the excess 
energy. Uranium-238, for example, is radioactive, undergoing a nuclear reaction emit-
ting helium-4 nuclei. The helium-4 particles are known as alpha (A) particles, and a 
stream of them is called alpha radiation. When a 238
92U nucleus loses an alpha particle, the 
remaining fragment has an atomic number of 90 and a mass number of 234. The element 
with atomic number 90 is Th, thorium. Therefore, the products of uranium-238 decom-
position are an alpha particle and a thorium-234
