Cell division and growth are almost always stimulated by external signals called
growth factors; left unregulated, cell growth leads to cancer. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, removes damaged or
unnecessary cells and plays a vital role in development, including morphogenesis of fingers and toes. Termination of the
cell signaling cascade is important to ensure that the response to a signal is appropriate in timing and intensity. Degradation
of signaling molecules and dephosphorylation of intermediates of the pathway are two ways signals are terminated within
cells. Conditions where signaling pathways are blocked or defective can be deleterious, preventative, or prophylactic;
examples include diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune disease, toxins, anesthetics, and birth control pills.
