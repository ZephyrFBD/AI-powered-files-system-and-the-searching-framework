 of the five mechanisms of evolution is
active.
 
2. Small populations are more subject to genetic drift than larger populations.
3. The dominant or recessive characteristic of an allele does not influence its selective value. A dominant or
recessive allele has selective value only if the phenotype it generates has selective value. Thus, a recessive trait may
have a greater selective value than a dominant trait. Without selection, the allele frequencies remain unchanged,
regardless of the dominant or recessive characteristic of the allele.
4. Selection can affect an individual at any stage during its life cycle: gamete, zygote, egg, larva, juvenile, or adult.
Ultimately, you should conclude that any of the five processes listed at the beginning of this investigation can
influence the evolution of populations. But which of these has the greatest influence? Although each population is
different and although evolution may progress differently in the same population at different times, stu
