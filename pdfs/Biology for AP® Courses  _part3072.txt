ynapses depend on the release
of neurotransmitter molecules from synaptic vesicles to pass on their signal, there is an approximately one millisecond
delay between when the axon potential reaches the presynaptic terminal and when the neurotransmitter leads to opening
of postsynaptic ion channels. Additionally, this signaling is unidirectional. Signaling in electrical synapses, in contrast,
is virtually instantaneous (which is important for synapses involved in key reflexes), and some electrical synapses are
bidirectional. Electrical synapses are also more reliable as they are less likely to be blocked, and they are important for
synchronizing the electrical activity of a group of neurons. For example, electrical synapses in the thalamus are thought to
regulate slow-wave sleep, and disruption of these synapses can cause seizures.
Signal Summation
Sometimes a single excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is strong enough to induce an action potential in the
postsynaptic neuron, but oft
