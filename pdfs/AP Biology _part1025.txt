transcription of a gene or genes to occur, RNA
polymerase must bind to a promoter. In choices A and B, the
repressor is bound to the operator, which excludes RNA polymerase
from binding to the promoter and prevents transcription. Choice D
does not make any sense because RNA polymerase does not bind to
the operator. It’s a matter of specificity, like a lock and key.
(B) A mutation in AUG would have disastrous consequences
because translation could not begin. Choice C refers to what
happens 
after 
transcription. 
RNA 
processing 
occurs 
after
transcription.
(C) The new strand is built 5' to 3', and the Okazaki fragments form,
moving away from the replication fork.
(B) RNA processing occurs before the preRNA transcript leaves the
nucleus. Introns, which are intervening sequences, are removed.
Exons are the expressed sequences, which are the genes or coding
regions.
(B) Restriction enzymes are referred to as “molecular scissors”
because they cut DNA at specific restriction sites. They ar
