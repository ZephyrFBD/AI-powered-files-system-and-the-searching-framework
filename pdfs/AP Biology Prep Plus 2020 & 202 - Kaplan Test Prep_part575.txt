The signal transduction pathway amplifies the signal at every step.
Therefore, the earlier in the pathway the doubling is made, the more of
an eﬀect it will have. (A) targets the earliest step in the process,
receptor-ligand binding. (B), (C), and (D) are all later in the pathway
and therefore would have less of an eﬀect.

Constantly phosphorylating Raf would permanently turn on the
production of mitosis-promoting genes. This would lead to
unregulated cell division, a hallmark trait of cancer. Thus, (A) is
correct. If Raf phosphorylation were turned oﬀ, mitosis would happen
less frequently, so (B) is incorrect. Directly phosphorylating MAPK
would decrease the frequency of mitosis because there would be no
amplification eﬀect of the cascade, so (C) is incorrect. (D) is incorrect
because if Ras could no longer interact with Sos, there would be no
activation of mitosis by this pathway.
