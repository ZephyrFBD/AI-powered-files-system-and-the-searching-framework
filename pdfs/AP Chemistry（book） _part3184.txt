Now we can use the summary in Figure 20.6 to help us describe 
the voltaic cell. The first half-reaction is the reduction process 
(electrons on the reactant side of the equation). By definition, the 
reduction process occurs at the cathode. The second half-reaction 
is the oxidation process (electrons on the product side of the equa-
tion), which occurs at the anode.
The I- ions are the source of electrons, and the Cr2O7
2- ions accept 
the electrons. Hence, the electrons flow through the external cir-
cuit from the electrode immersed in the KI solution (the anode) 
to the electrode immersed in the K2Cr2O7–H2SO4 solution (the 
cathode). The electrodes themselves do not react in any way; they 
merely provide a means of transferring electrons from or to the 
solutions. The cations move through the solutions toward the 
cathode, and the anions move toward the anode. The anode (from 
which the electrons move) is the negative electrode, and the cath-
ode (toward
