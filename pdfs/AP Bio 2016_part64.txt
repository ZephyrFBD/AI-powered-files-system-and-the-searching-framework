and water (H2O) vapor in experiment 1 could react spontaneously to produce 
the phospholipids required by the first life-forms. 
(B) The nitrogen (N2) gas and ammonia (NH3) gas in experiment 1 could provide the elemental nitrogen 
required for the formation of amino acids. 
(C) The sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas in experiment 2 could donate the excited electrons required to drive the 
process of photosynthesis. 
(D) The methane (CH4) gas in experiment 2 could act as the electron acceptor required to complete the process  
of cellular respiration.
