When light energy boosts electrons from photosystem P680 to the
electron acceptor, what replaces the missing electrons?
photosystem I
photosystem II
water
NADPH
In an experiment, chloroplasts are isolated from cells and placed in
an Erlenmeyer flask with all the chemicals necessary for the
chloroplasts to carry out ATP synthesis. Next, you place the flask
under strong white light. Predict what will happen to the rate of
photosynthesis if a compound that makes membranes permeable to
protons (H+) is added to the flask, and give the correct reason for
your prediction.
ATP production will decrease because the compound
introduced will shut down the electron transport chain in the
thylakoid membrane.
ATP production will decrease because no proton gradient can
be maintained across the thylakoid membrane.
ATP production will increase
