 reactors must be stopped 
periodically to either replace or reprocess the nuclear fuel. When the fuel elements are 
removed from the reactor, they are initially very radioactive. It was originally intended 
that they be stored for several months in pools at the reactor site to allow decay of short-
lived radioactive nuclei. They were then to be transported in shielded containers to 
reprocessing plants where the unspent fuel would be separated from the fission prod-
ucts. Reprocessing plants have been plagued with operational difficulties, however, and 
there is intense opposition in the United States to the transport of nuclear wastes on the 
nationâ€™s roads and rails.
Even if the transportation difficulties could be overcome, the high level of radio-
activity of the spent fuel makes reprocessing a hazardous operation. At present in the 
United States, spent fuel elements are kept in storage at reactor sites. Spent fuel is repro-
cessed, however, in France, Russia, the United Kingdom,
