re sensors with computer interface) are described in the Student Manual, and 
alternative procedures may be equally and successfully substituted. For example, in the 
procedures outlined in the Student Manual, consumption of O2 gas in respiration is

measured, but students also can measure the production of CO2 or even simultaneous 
changes in volumes of both gases, depending on available equipment. 
Measuring the rate of respiration is more technically challenging than many lab 
procedures because there are many places for potential error in the assembly and use 
of the respirometers described in the AP Biology Lab Manual (2001), Lab 5. Since gas 
pressure sensors are expensive, the microrespirometer system described in the Student 
Manual provides an easier, cheaper, and more reliable method to study both plant 
seed and small insect metabolisms. Microrespirometers provide advantages for use 
in high school laboratories because they cost less
