or the semipermeable cell membrane. A
solution of glucose and starch is placed into dialysis tubing and is tied off at both ends to create a model cell. This
model is placed into a beaker of water to which iodine has been added. The dialysis tubing that is used has pores
through which relatively small molecules can pass but much larger molecules cannot.
When iodine comes into contact with starch, the iodine-starch complex turns deep blue or blue-black in color,
allowing one to monitor the movement of iodine and starch. The movement of glucose can be monitored in a
number of ways, including the use of the Benedictâ€™s assay for glucose or simple glucose test strips.
The experimental results, as shown in Figure 24.4, indicate that while water, glucose, and iodine can pass
through the pores in the semipermeable dialysis tubing, the starch molecules cannot.
