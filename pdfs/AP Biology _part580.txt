the offspring can survive without the parent, the response
disappears.
Classic imprinting experiments were carried out by Konrad Lorenz
with geese. Geese hatchlings will follow the first thing they see that
moves. Although the object is usually the mother goose, it can be a box
tied to a string or, in the case of the classic experiment, it was Konrad
Lorenz himself. Lorenz was the first thing the hatchlings saw, and they
became imprinted on the scientist. Wherever he went, they followed.
Examples of Learning and Problem Solving
If a chimpanzee is placed into a room with several boxes spaced out on the
floor and a banana hanging high out of reach, the chimp will stack the
boxes on top of each other until he reaches the banana. This problem-
solving behavior is highly developed in some mammals, especially in
primates. It has also been observed in some birds, especially ravens. In one
study, a raven was able to fly to a branch and step on a string in order to
bring some hanging food withi
