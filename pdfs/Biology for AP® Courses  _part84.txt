basic science.
One example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred after the discovery of
DNA structure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication. Strands of DNA, unique
in every human, are found in our cells, where they provide the instructions necessary for life. During DNA replication,
DNA makes new copies of itself, shortly before a cell divides. Understanding the mechanisms of DNA replication enabled
scientists to develop laboratory techniques that are now used to identify genetic diseases. Without basic science, it is
unlikely that applied science would exist.
Another example of the link between basic and applied research is the Human Genome Project, a study in which each
human chromosome was analyzed and mapped to determine the precise sequence of DNA subunits and the exact location
of each gene. (The gene is the basic unit of heredity; an individualâ€™s complete collection of ge
