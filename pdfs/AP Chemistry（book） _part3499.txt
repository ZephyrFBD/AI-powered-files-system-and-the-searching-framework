st of the hydrogen on our planet is found associated with oxygen. Water, which 
is 11% hydrogen by mass, is the most abundant hydrogen compound.
Isotopes of Hydrogen
The most common isotope of hydrogen, 1
1H, has a nucleus consisting of a single pro-
ton. This isotope, sometimes referred to as protium,* makes up 99.9844% of naturally 
occurring hydrogen.

Two other isotopes are known: 2
1H, whose nucleus contains a proton and a neutron, and 
3
1H, whose nucleus contains a proton and two neutrons. The 2
1H isotope, deuterium, makes 
up 0.0156% of naturally occurring hydrogen. It is not radioactive, and it is often given the 
symbol D in chemical formulas, as in D2O (deuterium oxide), which is known as heavy water.
Because an atom of deuterium is about twice as massive as an atom of protium, the 
properties of deuterium-containing substances vary somewhat from those of the protium- 
containing analogs. For example, the normal melting and boiling points of D
