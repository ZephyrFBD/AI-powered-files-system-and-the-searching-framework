Remember to take the reciprocal
Current in one branch. What is the current 
through the
resistor in Fig. 19–7a?
APPROACH We need the voltage across the 
resistor, which is the voltage
between points b and c in Fig.19–7a, and we call it 
Once 
is known, we can
apply Ohm’s law,
to get the current. First we find the voltage across the
resistor,
since we know that 17.4 mA passes through it (Example 19–4).
SOLUTION
can be found using 
The total voltage across the network of resistors is
so 
must be
Ohm’s law gives the current 
through the 
resistor:
This is the answer we wanted. We can also calculate the current 
through the
resistor since the voltage across it is also 5.0 V:
NOTE When 
combines with 
to form the total current I (at point c in
Fig.19–7a), their sum is
This equals the total current I
as calculated in Example 19–4, as it should.
10 mA + 7 mA = 17 mA.
