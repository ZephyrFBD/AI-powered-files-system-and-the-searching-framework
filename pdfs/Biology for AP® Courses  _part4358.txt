Think About It
Why is long-term parental care not associated with having many offspring during a reproductive episode?
Section Summary
All species have evolved a pattern of living, called a life history strategy, in which they partition energy for growth,
maintenance, and reproduction. These patterns evolve through natural selection; they allow species to adapt to their
environment to obtain the resources they need to successfully reproduce. There is an inverse relationship between fecundity
and parental care. A species may reproduce early in life to ensure surviving to a reproductive age or reproduce later in life
to become larger and healthier and better able to give parental care. A species may reproduce once (semelparity) or many
times (iteroparity) in its life.
