The results of crossing over during meiosis can be readily visualized under the microscope in the asci of the fungus
Sordaria. Fungi grow as filaments called hyphae. Specialized hyphae, called asci, are reproductive filaments that
contain eight haploid ascospores. The asci are embedded in other hyphae that form a fruiting body. One kind of
fruiting body, a perithecium, surrounds the asci, except for a passageway that allows for the escape of the
ascospores.
Sexual reproduction begins when hyphae from two strains fuse. Nuclei from one strain pair with nuclei from the
second strain. Subsequently, these pairs of unlike nuclei fuse to produce diploid nuclei, which then undergo meiosis.
During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair and separate. During meiosis II, each chromosome separates into
two chromatids. At the end of meiosis, there are four daughter cells, each possessing a single chromatid originating
from one of the four chromatids that made up each pair of homologous chr
