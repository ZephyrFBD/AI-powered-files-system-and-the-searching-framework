ve). Since
Ψ for the distilled water is 0, and Ψ for the potato is negative, water, which moves from areas of higher water
potential to lower water potential, will move into the potato. As the water concentration
increases in the potato cell, Ψs will increase (it will become less
 
negative) and the value of Ψ in the potato will increase (it will become less negative).
19. D. Restriction enzymes cut DNA molecules. Like all enzymes, restriction enzymes have active sites that are
specific to their substrates, so the sequence of nucleotides on the DNA molecule where the cut occurs is different for
different restriction enzymes.
20. C. Many restriction enzymes do not make a straight cut across a DNA double helix, but instead leave single-
stranded DNA tails on the DNA segments produced. These single-stranded DNA tails are called sticky ends.
21. B. Catalyzing the union of two DNA segments with complementary sticky ends occurs with the enzyme DNA
ligase, the same enzyme that joins Okazaki s
