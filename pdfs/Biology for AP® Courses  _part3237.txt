to only 10 percent of the afferent neurons, and each afferent neuron innervates many hair cells. The afferent, bipolar neurons
that convey auditory information travel from the cochlea to the medulla, through the pons and midbrain in the brainstem,
finally reaching the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe.
Vestibular Information
The stimuli associated with the vestibular system are linear acceleration (gravity) and angular acceleration and deceleration.
Gravity, acceleration, and deceleration are detected by evaluating the inertia on receptive cells in the vestibular system.
Gravity is detected through head position. Angular acceleration and deceleration are expressed through turning or tilting of
the head.
The vestibular system has some similarities with the auditory system. It utilizes hair cells just like the auditory system, but
it excites them in different ways. There are five vestibular receptor organs in the inner ear: the utricle, the saccule, and three
