bonds between atoms form because of the interaction of their electrons. The electronegativity of
an atom, or the ability of an atom to attract electrons, plays a large part in determining the kind of bond that forms.
There are three kinds of bonds, as follows:
1. Ionic bonds form between two atoms when one or more electrons are transferred from one atom to the other. This
bond occurs when the electronegativities of the atoms are very different and one atom has a much stronger pull on
the electrons (high electronegativity) than the other atom in the bond. The atom that gains electrons has an overall
negative charge, and the atom that loses electrons has an overall positive charge. Because of their positive or
negative charges, these atoms are ions. The attraction of the positive ion to the negative ion constitutes the
ionic bond. Sodium and chlorine form ions (Na+ and Clâˆ’), and the bond
 
formed in a molecule of sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic bond.
2. Covalent bonds form when electr
