CHAPTER 21
Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday’s Law
14. A bar magnet falling inside a vertical metal tube reaches a
terminal velocity even if the tube is evacuated so that there
is no air resistance. Explain.
15. It has been proposed that eddy currents be used to help sort
solid waste for recycling. The waste is first ground into tiny
pieces and iron removed with a magnet. The waste then 
is allowed to slide down an incline over permanent magnets.
How will this aid in the separation of nonferrous metals
(Al, Cu, Pb, brass) from nonmetallic materials?
16. The pivoted metal bar with slots in Fig. 21–50 falls much
more quickly through
a magnetic field than
does a
solid bar.
Explain.
17. If an aluminum sheet is held between the poles of a large
bar magnet, it requires some force to pull it out of the mag-
netic
