 and bind to internal receptors. Water-soluble hydrophilic
ligands are unable to pass through the membrane; instead, they bind to cell-surface receptors, which transmit the signal to
the inside of the cell.
9.2 Propagation of the Signal
Ligand binding to the receptor allows for signal transduction through the cell. The chain of events that conveys the signal
through the cell is called a signaling pathway or cascade. Signaling pathways are often very complex because of the
interplay between different proteins. A major component of cell signaling cascades is the phosphorylation of molecules by
enzymes known as kinases. Phosphorylation adds a phosphate group to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in a
protein, changing their shapes, and activating or inactivating the protein. Small molecules like nucleotides can also be
phosphorylated. Second messengers are small, non-protein molecules that are used to transmit a signal within a cell. Some
examples of second messengers are calcium io
