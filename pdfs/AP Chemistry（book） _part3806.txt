.2 lists the ten simplest alkanes. Many of these substances are familiar 
because they are used so widely. Methane is a major component of natural gas. Ethane 
is also a component of natural gas and is a feedstock for making polyethylene. 
 (Sec-
tion 12.8) Propane is the major component of bottled gas used for home heating and

cooking in areas where natural gas is not available. Butane is used in disposable lighters 
and in fuel canisters for gas camping stoves and lanterns. Alkanes with 5 to 12 carbon 
atoms per molecule are used to make gasoline. Notice that each succeeding compound 
in Table 24.2 has an additional CH2 unit.
