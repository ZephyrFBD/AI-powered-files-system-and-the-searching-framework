35. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) with a wild-type
phenotype have gray bodies and red eyes. Certain
mutations can cause changes to these traits. Mutant flies
may have a black body and/or cinnabar eyes. To study the
genetics of these traits, a researcher crossed a true-
breeding wild-typed male fly with a true-breeding female
fly with a black body and cinnabar eyes. All of the F1
progeny displayed a wild type phenotype. Which of the
following is correct about the traits observed?
a.
Gray body and cinnabar eyes are dominant.
b.
Eye color is sex-linked.
c.
