The most obvious feature of Argumentation questions is that they reference a source of data or a piece of
information. While Concept Explanation questions also reference information, they are more focused on memorized
biological facts instead of justification and evidence. Many of the questions start with “which of the following best
predicts the consequence…” or “which of the following best supports the claim that…”
Questions 4–6 refer to the following material.
Table 1. Effect of temperature on glucose production
Figure 1. Effect of heat on the structure of lactase
Lactase is an enzyme found in many mammals that breaks down lactose, a sugar found in milk, into glucose
through a hydrolysis reaction. Scientists hypothesized that lactase’s efficiency is affected by temperature. To
test this hypothesis, the scientists dissolved lactase table
