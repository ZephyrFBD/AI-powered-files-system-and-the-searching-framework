Familiarizing yourself with the similarities between cellular respiration and photosynthesis is recommended. It’s been a
popular test item on past AP® Biology exams. Be sure you know about ATP production, electron transport use,
compartmentalization between chloroplast and mitochondria, hydrogen and electron acceptor molecules, such as NADH,
FADH2, and NADPH.

Key Concepts
A. Cellular respiration is the catalysis (breakdown) of glucose to produce energy (ATP) and or
