.A.2
Epigenetic changes can affect gene expression 
through reversible modifications of DNA or histones.
IST-2.A.3
The phenotype of a cell or organism is determined 
by the combination of genes that are expressed 
and the levels at which they are expressed—
a. Observable cell differentiation results 
from the expression of genes for tissue-
specific proteins.
