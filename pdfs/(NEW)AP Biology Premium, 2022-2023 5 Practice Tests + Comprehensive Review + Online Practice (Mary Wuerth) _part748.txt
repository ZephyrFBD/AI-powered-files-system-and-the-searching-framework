s an example of negative feedback, so
choice (C) is incorrect. The release of insulin lowers blood sugar, returning blood sugar levels to normal levels,
so choice (D) is also incorrect.
48. (C) Mutations in a splice site could result in errors in intron splicing and the loss of exons. Choice (A) is
incorrect because a nonsense mutation (which would form a stop codon) would result in a truncated protein, not
the deletion of two exons at different locations in the gene. Translocations would most likely form a completely
different protein, so choice (B) is incorrect. A point mutation would not result in the deletion of two different
exons, so choice (D) is incorrect.
49. (D) The F508del mutation results in a misfolded protein, so a treatment that helps the CFTR protein fold
correctly would be an effective treatment for the result of this mutation. Activation of transcription of the CFTR
gene with the F508del mutation would not be effective. It would just produce more of the misfolded prot
