m g
Gravity on Everest. Estimate the effective
value of g on the top of Mt. Everest, 8850 m (29,035 ft) above sea level 
(Fig. 5–20). That is, what is the acceleration due to gravity of objects allowed to
fall freely at this altitude? Ignore the mass of the mountain itself.
APPROACH The force of gravity (and the acceleration due to gravity g) depends
on the distance from the center of the Earth, so there will be an effective value
on top of Mt. Everest which will be smaller than g at sea level. We assume the
Earth is a uniform sphere (a reasonable “estimate”).
SOLUTION We use Eq. 5–5, with 
replaced by  
which is a reduction of about 3 parts in a thousand (0.3%).
