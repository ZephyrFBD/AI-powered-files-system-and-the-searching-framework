f solute molecules across a semi-permeable membrane by the movement of water to the side of higher solute
concentration. Facilitated diffusion utilizes protein channels to move solute molecules from areas of higher to lower
concentration while active transport mechanisms are required to move solutes against concentration gradients. Osmolarity
is measured in units of milliequivalents or milliosmoles, both of which take into consideration the number of solute
particles and the charge on them. Fish that live in fresh water or saltwater adapt by being osmoregulators or
osmoconformers.
32.2 The Kidneys and Osmoregulatory Organs
The kidneys are the main osmoregulatory organs in mammalian systems; they function to filter blood and maintain the
osmolarity of body fluids at 300 mOsm. They are surrounded by three layers and are made up internally of three distinct
regionsâ€”the cortex, medulla, and pelvis.
The blood vessels that transport blood into and out of the kidneys arise from and merge with
