ensor, and actually be seen on a white
surface or screen placed at the position of the image (Fig. 23–38).

Half-blocked lens. What happens to the
image of an object if the top half of a lens is covered by a piece of cardboard?
RESPONSE Let us look at the rays in Fig.23–37. If the top half (or any half of the
lens) is blocked, you might think that half the image is blocked. But in Fig. 23–37c,
we see how the rays used to create the “top” of the image pass through both 
the top and the bottom of the lens. Only three of many rays are shown—many
more rays pass through the lens, and they can form the image. You don’t lose
the image. But covering part of the lens cuts down on the total light received and
reduces the brightness of the image.
NOTE If the lens is partially blocked by your thumb, you may notice an out of
focus image of part of that thumb.
