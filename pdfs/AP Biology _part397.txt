Fungi
All are heterotrophs and eukaryotes
Secrete hydrolytic enzymes outside the body where extracellular
digestion occurs; then the building blocks of the nutrients are
absorbed into the body of the fungus by diffusion
Are important in the ecosystem as decomposers
Cell walls are composed of chitin, not cellulose
Examples: yeast, mold, mushrooms, the fungus that causes
athleteâ€™s foot
Plantae
All are autotrophic eukaryotes
Some plants have vascular tissue (Tracheophytes); some do not
have any vascular tissue (Bryophytes)
Examples: mosses, ferns, cone-bearing and flowering plants
Animalia All are heterotrophic, multicellular eukaryotes
Are grouped in 35 phyla, but this book discusses 9 main phyla:
Porifera, Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Annelida,
Mollusca, Arthropoda, Echinodermata, and Chordata
Most animals reproduce sexually with a dominant diploid stage
In most species, a small, flagellated sperm fertilizes a larger,
nonmotile egg
