uence 2 has more guanines and cytosines. The G-C bond has three hydrogen bonds between it rather
than the two hydrogen bonds that the A-C bond has. This results in a higher melting temperature because
it is more difficult to break the strands apart.

C
There are 40/360 (0.11) homozygous recessives = the frequency of homozygous recessive = q2, and then
q = 0.33 and if p + q = 1, then p = 0.67. The frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq = 2 (0.33)(0.67) = 0.44.

Blood pressure is increased when the space gets smaller (constriction of blood vessels) or when the
volume gets bigger. When the blood gets too salty, it takes on water to dilute the salt and the volume
increases. So, constricting vessels and increasing salt intake will increase blood pressure.

A
The substrate is H2O2 because that is what the HRP enzyme acts upon. Water and oxygen are the
products.

B
The substrate increases from 10% to 100%, so we know the substrate is still available. However, it is the
enzyme that re
