Figure 37.9 Swimming shrimp, a few squat lobsters, and hundreds of vent mussels are seen at a hydrothermal vent
at the bottom of the ocean. As no sunlight penetrates to this depth, the ecosystem is supported by chemoautotrophic
bacteria and organic material that sinks from the oceanâ€™s surface. This picture was taken in 2006 at the submerged NW
Eifuku volcano off the coast of Japan by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The summit of

Productivity within Trophic Levels
Productivity within an ecosystem can be defined as the percentage of energy entering the ecosystem incorporated into
biomass in a particular trophic level. Biomass is the total mass, in a unit area at the time of measurement, of living or
