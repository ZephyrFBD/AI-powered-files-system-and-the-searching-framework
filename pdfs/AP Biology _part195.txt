GLYCOLYSIS
Glycolysis is a ten-step process that breaks down 1 molecule of glucose (a
six-carbon molecule) into 2 three-carbon molecules of pyruvate or
pyruvic acid and releases 4 molecules of ATP. The energy of activation
to begin glycolysis is 2 ATP. After subtracting 2 ATPs from the 4 ATPs
released from the reaction, the glycolysis of 1 molecule of glucose results

in a net gain of 2 ATP. Here is the simplified equation.
RELAX
You do not have to memorize the details of glycolysis or the Krebs cycle for the exam.
2 ATP + 1 Glucose â†’ 2 Pyruvate + 4 ATP
Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and releases ATP without using
oxygen. Each step is catalyzed by a different enzyme. Although this
process releases only one-fourth of the energy stored in glucose (most of
the energy remains locked in pyruvate), the reac
