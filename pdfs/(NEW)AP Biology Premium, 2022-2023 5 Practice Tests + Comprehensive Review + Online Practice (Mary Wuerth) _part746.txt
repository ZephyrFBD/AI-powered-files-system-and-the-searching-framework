water molecules. Hydrogen bonds do not form between oxygen atoms, so choice (B) is incorrect.
42. (D) Alpha helixes and beta sheets are forms of secondary structure and are formed by hydrogen bonds. Choices
(A) and (B) are incorrect because alpha helixes and beta sheets are not forms of primary structure. Secondary
structure is formed by hydrogen bonds, not peptide bonds, so choice (C) is incorrect.
43. (C) Nucleic acids contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Choice (A) is incorrect because
carbohydrates do not usually contain nitrogen nor phosphorous. Lipids usually do not contain nitrogen, so
choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because proteins usually do not contain phosphorus.
44. (C) The R-group (also known as the side chain) of an amino acid is unique to that amino acid and determines
whether the amino acid is hydrophobic or hydrophilic. Therefore, it influences how the amino acid would
interact with the aqueous environment of the cell. Ch
