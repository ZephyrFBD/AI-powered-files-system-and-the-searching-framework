ased tree, Annelida and Arthropoda have a more recent common
ancestor than Arthropoda and Nematoda. However, in the molecular data-based tree,
Arthropoda and Nematoda have a more recent ancestor than Annelida and Arthropoda,
making (A) correct. (B) is incorrect because it is not a conclusion that can be drawn from
the morphology-based tree. (C) can be eliminated because the morphology-based tree
does not use DNA sequencing. (D) is incorrect because both trees show a more distant
common ancestor for the Radiata than the Bilateria.

Phylogenetics, by its very nature—looking back into prehistory—is an imperfect science,
one that will never be completely accurate. (D) is therefore correct. (A) is unlikely to be a
true statement and less likely to be supported by both teams of scientists. (B) is incorrect
because the fossil record may be “set in stone,” but it is far from the ultimate authority—
the most robust phylogenetic hypotheses are those evidenced by numerous lines of
