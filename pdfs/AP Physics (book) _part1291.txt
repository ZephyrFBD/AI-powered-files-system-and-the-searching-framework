11–19b), where

the overtones. All of the standing waves,
are called harmonics†,
as we saw in Section 11–12.
When a finger is placed on the string of a guitar or violin, the effective length
of the vibrating string is shortened. So its fundamental frequency, and pitch, is
higher since the wavelength of the fundamental is shorter (Fig. 12–8). The strings
on a guitar or violin are all the same length. They sound at a different pitch
because the strings have different mass per unit length,
which affects
the velocity on the string, Eq. 11–13,
[stretched string]
Thus the velocity on a heavier string is lower and the frequency will be lower for
the same wavelength. The tension 
also has an effect: indeed, adjusting the ten-
sion is the means for tuning the pitch of each string. In pianos and harps the strings
are of different lengths. For the lower notes the strings are not only longer, but
heavier as well, and the reason is illustrated in the following Examp
