d the south pole.
It is a familiar observation that when two magnets are brought near one another,
each exerts a force on the other. The force can be either attractive or repulsive
and can be felt even when the magnets don’t touch. If the north pole of one bar
magnet is brought near the north pole of a second magnet, the force is repulsive.
Similarly, if the south poles are brought close, the force is repulsive. But when
the north pole of one magnet is brought near the south pole of another magnet,
the force is attractive. These results are shown in Fig. 20–2, and are reminiscent
of the forces between electric charges: like poles repel, and unlike poles attract.
But do not confuse magnetic poles with electric charge. They are very different.
One important difference is that a positive or negative electric charge can easily
be isolated. But an isolated single magnetic pole has never been observed. If a
bar magnet is cut in half, you do not obtain isolated north and south poles.
Instead,
