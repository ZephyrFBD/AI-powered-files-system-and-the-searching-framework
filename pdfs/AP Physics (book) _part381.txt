Our next Example involves two boxes connected by a cord. We can refer to
this group of objects as a system. A system is any group of one or more objects we
choose to consider and study.

wo boxes connected by a cord. Two boxes, A and B, are
connected by a lightweight cord and are resting on a smooth (frictionless) table.
The boxes have masses of 12.0 kg and 10.0 kg. A horizontal force 
of 40.0 N is
applied to the 10.0-kg box, as shown in Fig. 4–22a. Find (a) the acceleration of
each box, and (b) the tension in the cord connecting the boxes.
APPROACH We streamline our approach by not listing each step. We have two
boxes so we draw a free-body diagram for each. To draw them correctly, we
must consider the forces on each box by itself, so that Newton’s second law 
can
