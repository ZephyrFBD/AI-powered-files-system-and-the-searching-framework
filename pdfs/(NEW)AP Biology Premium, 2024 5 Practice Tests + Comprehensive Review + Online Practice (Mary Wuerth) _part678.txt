she cannot inherit the allele from him, so
there is no probability for her to be color blind. Choices (B), (C), and (D) do not list the correct percentage.
48. (D) The woman in generation II is not color blind but her father in generation I was color blind, so the pedigree
shown in choice (D) matches the text description. Choice (A) is incorrect because the male in generation II is
not color blind (according to the text), so his square should not be shaded. The woman in generation II is not
color blind (according to the text), so her circle should not be shaded. Therefore, choice (B) is incorrect. Choice
(C) is incorrect for two reasons. First, the male in generation I was color blind, so his square should be shaded.
Second, the male in generation II is not color blind, so his square should not be shaded.
49. (D) Weather is a density-independent factor that is not affected by population density. Choices (A), (B), and
(C) all do depend on population density and are therefore incorrect.
