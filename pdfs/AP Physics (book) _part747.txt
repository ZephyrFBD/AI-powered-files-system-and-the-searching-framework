If we use the same reasoning as we did to obtain Eq. 7–10, we find

(7;11)
That is, the sum of all the forces acting on the system is equal to the total mass of
the system times the acceleration of its center of mass. This is Newton’s second 
law for a system of particles. It also applies to an extended object (which can be
thought of as a collection of particles). Thus the center of mass of a system of 
particles (or of an object) with total mass M moves as if all its mass were concen-
trated at the center of mass and all the external forces acted at that point. We can
thus treat the translational motion of any object or system of objects as the
motion of a particle (see Figs. 7–20 and 7–21). This result simplifies our analysis
of the motion of complex systems and extended objects. Although the motion of
