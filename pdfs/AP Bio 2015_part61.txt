 The transmission of information from sensory 
neurons to interneurons typically involves the 
(A) exchange of electrons between specialized 
 
proteins embedded in the plasma membrane 
of the sensory neuron to the plasma 
membrane of the interneuron 
(B) release of chemical messengers into the space 
between the axon of the sensory neuron 
 and 
the plasma membrane of the interneuron 
(C) transfer of a phosphate group from ATP in 
the sensory neuron to a protein substrate in 
the interneuron 
(D) flow of protons down an electrochemical 
gradient through a gated channel between 
the sensory neuron and the interneuron
