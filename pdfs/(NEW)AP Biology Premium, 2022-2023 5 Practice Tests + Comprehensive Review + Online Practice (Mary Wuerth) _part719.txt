Fordinae geocia and Fordinae formicaria are two species of gall-forming aphids. By creating galls, nutrient-rich sap
from the phloem of the host plant is suctioned into these voids, providing food for the aphids.
F. geocia were introduced onto a rose bush upon which F. formicaria had already inhabited and built galls. Three
months later, the number of F. formicaria was reduced by 84%, while the number of F. geocia increased by over
300%. Analysis of the gall co
