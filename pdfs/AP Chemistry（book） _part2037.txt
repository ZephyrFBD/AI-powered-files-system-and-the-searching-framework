▲ Figure 13.7 Precipitation from a supersaturated sodium acetate solution. The solution on the left was  
formed by dissolving about 170 g of the salt in 100 mL of water at 100 °C and then slowly cooling it to  
20 °C. Because the solubility of sodium acetate in water at 20 °C is 46 g per 100 mL of water, the solution  
is supersaturated. Addition of a sodium acetate crystal causes the excess solute to crystallize from solution.
Give It Some Thought
What happens if a solute is added to a saturated solution?

13.3 ∣ Factors Affecting Solubility
The extent to which one substance dissolves in another depends on the nature of both 
substances. 
 (Section 13.1) It also depends on temperature and, at least for gases, on 
pressure.
Solute–Solvent Interactions
The natural tendency of substances to mix and the various interactions among sol-
ute and solvent particles are all involved in determining
