Explain.
4. Can a copper wire and an aluminum wire of the same
length have the same resistance? Explain.
5. One terminal of a car battery is said to be connected to
“ground.” Since it is not really connected to the ground,
what is meant by this expression?
6. The equation 
indicates that the power dissipated
in a resistor decreases if the resistance is increased, whereas
the equation
implies the opposite. Is there a
contradiction here? Explain.
7. What happens when a lightbulb burns out?
8. If the resistance of a small immersion heater (to heat water
for tea or soup, Fig. 18–32) was increased, would it speed up
or slow down the heating process? Explain.
P = I2R
P = V2R
(Ah)?
Questions
9. If a rectangular solid made of carbon has sides of lengths a,
2a, and 3a, to which faces would you connect the wires
from a battery so as to obtain (a) the least resistance, (b) the
greatest resistance?
10. Explain why lightbulbs almost always burn out just as they
are turned on and no
