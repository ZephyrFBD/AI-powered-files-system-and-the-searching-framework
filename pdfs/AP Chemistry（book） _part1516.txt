.72  (a) Sketch the molecular orbitals of the H2
- ion and draw its 
energy-level diagram. (b) Write the electron configuration of 
the ion in terms of its MOs. (c) Calculate the bond order in 
H2
-. (d) Suppose that the ion is excited by light, so that an 
electron moves from a lower-energy to a higher-energy molec-
ular orbital. Would you expect the excited-state H2
- ion to be 
stable? (e) Which of the following statements about part (d) 
 
is correct: (i) The light excites an electron from a bonding or-
bital to an antibonding orbital, (ii) The light excites an elec-
tron from an antibonding orbital to a bonding orbital, or (iii) 
In the excited state there are more bonding electrons than 
antibonding electrons?
 9.73 Draw a picture that shows all three 2p orbitals on one atom 
and all three 2p orbitals on another atom. (a) Imagine the 
atoms coming close together to bond. How many s bonds 
can the two sets of 2p orbitals make with each other? (b) How 
many p bonds can the two sets
