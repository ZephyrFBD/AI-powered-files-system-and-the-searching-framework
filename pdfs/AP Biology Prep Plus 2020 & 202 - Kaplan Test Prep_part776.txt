mics include predation and symbiosis
(mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism). Predation involves one
organism feeding on another and typically occurs interspecies. For
instance, some protozoans prey on bacteria and some plants can trap
and digest insects. Symbiosis describes the relationship between two
diﬀerent organisms. In mutualism, both organisms in the relationship
benefit. Examples include bacteria in digestive tracts of animals and
pollination. Bacteria in cows help cows digest cellulose and in turn cows
provide bacteria with nutrients and a hospitable place to live. During
pollination, plants provide insects with food and insects help plants
spread their pollen from one plant to another. In commensalism, one
organism benefits and the other is unharmed, whereas in parasitism one
benefits while the other is harmed. Remoras attached to sharks obtain
protection and leȇover food, while the shark is unaﬀected. Fleas and
ticks, in contrast, are external parasites that feed on the b
