extrapolate and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid. Studies in climate
change can illustrate this type of reasoning. For example, scientists may predict that if the climate becomes warmer in a
particular region, then the distribution of plants and animals should change. These predictions have been made and tested,
and many such changes have been found, such as the modification of arable areas for agriculture, with change based on
temperature averages.
Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive science and hypothesis-
based science. Descriptive (or discovery) science, which is usuall
