er aquatic organisms, has gills that allow it to obtain oxygen from water.

The folded surfaces of the gills provide a large surface area to ensure that the fish gets sufficient oxygen. Diffusion is a
process in which material travels from regions of high concentration to low concentration until equilibrium is reached. In
this case, blood with a low concentration of oxygen molecules circulates through the gills. The concentration of oxygen
molecules in water is higher than the concentration of oxygen molecules in gills. As a result, oxygen molecules diffuse from
water (high concentration) to blood (low concentration), as shown in Figure 30.5. Similarly, carbon dioxide molecules in
the blood diffuse from the blood (high concentration) to water (low concentration).
