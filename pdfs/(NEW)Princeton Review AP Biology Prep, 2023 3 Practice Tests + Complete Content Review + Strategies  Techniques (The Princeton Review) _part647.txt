ls cause the heart to contract. If chamber 3 is full of more blood, then that would indicate
that the preceding chamber, chamber 2 (right atrium), had suddenly contracted a larger amount.

Normal cells can become cancerous when a virus invades the cell and takes over the replicative machinery.
This would occur if the mammalian genome is altered, such as if the viral genome inserted itself and disrupted
mammalian gene expression. A pilus forms between two bacteria, so (A) is wrong. Also eliminate (C) because
the hostâ€™s genome is not converted to the viral genome. Choice (D) is incorrect because spores are released by
fungi, not viruses.
25. D
Crossing-over and synapsis occur during meiosis, which produces haploid gametes, not diploid. Separation of
homologous chromosomes occurs during meiosis I, while separation of sister chromatids does not occur until
meiosis II.

If the scientist is trying to investigate inter-species breeding, the two potential mates must come from differe
