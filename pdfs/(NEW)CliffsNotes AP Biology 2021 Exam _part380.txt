Answers and Explanations
Multiple-Choice Questions
1. B. Weak hydrogen bonds form between bases of the two strands. In particular, a pyrimidine (a base with one
nitrogen ring) in one strand bonds to a purine (a base with two nitrogen rings) in the second strand.
2. C. Thymine is not used as a base in any RNA nucleotide. Instead, RNA uses the uracil base, which base-pairs
with the adenine DNA nucleotide during transcription.
3. A. Ribosome is a complex of rRNA molecules (RNA nucleotides) and proteins (amino acids). The remaining
choices are incorrect because the uracil nucleotide contains a ribose sugar (not a deoxyribose sugar), adenine
nucleotides base-pair with uracil nucleotides, and both DNA and RNA are produced in the nucleus.
4. C. R
