ling linoleum at Cannock’s big shop on Patrick Street. His 
 
 uncle, Foncey, sold linoleum there for years and made enough money 
 
 to start his own shop in Dublin, where he has his three sons selling 
 
 linoleum. Father Gorey, the director, can easily get Declan the reward of 
 
 a job at Cannock’s if he’s a good prefect and has perfect attendance in 
 
 his section and that’s why Declan will destroy us if we’re absent. He tells 
 
 us,No one will stand between me and the linoleum. 
 
 Declan likes Question Quigley and lets him miss an occasional Friday 
 
 night because the Question said, Declan, when I grow up and get 
 
 married I’m going to cover my house in linoleum and I’ll buy it all 
 
  
  
 from you. 
 
 Other boys in the section try this trick with Declan but he says, 
 
 Bugger off, ye’ll be lucky enough to have a pot to piss in never mind 
 
 yards of linoleum. 
 
 Dad says when he was my age in Toome he served Mass for years and 
 
 it’s time for me to be an altar boy
