by burning 2.0 tons of coal containing 3.5% S by mass? 
 
(c) What mass of elemental sulfur is produced? Assume that 
all reactions are 100% efficient.
 22.99  The maximum allowable concentration of H2S1g2 in air is 20 
mg per kilogram of air (20 ppm by mass). How many grams 
of FeS would be required to react with hydrochloric acid 
to produce this concentration at 1.00 atm and 25 °C in an 
average room measuring 12 ft * 20 ft * 8 ft? (Under these 
conditions, the average molar mass of air is 29.0 g>mol.)
22.100 The standard heats of formation of H2O1g2, H2S1g2, H2Se1g2, 
and H2Te1g2 are -241.8, -20.17, +29.7, and +99.6 kJ>
mol, respectively. The enthalpies necessary to convert the 
elements in their standard states to one mole of gaseous 
atoms are 248, 277, 227, and 197 kJ>mol of atoms for O, S, 
Se, and Te, respectively. The enthalpy for dissociation of H2 
is 436 kJ>mol. Calculate the average H ¬O, H ¬S, H ¬ Se, 
and H ¬ Te bond enthalpies, and co
