The building blocks of DNA are nucleotides. The important components of the nucleotide are a nitrogenous base,
deoxyribose (5-carbon sugar), and a phosphate group (Figure 14.5). The nucleotide is named depending on the nitrogenous
base. The nitrogenous base can be a purine such as adenine (A) and guanine (G), or a pyrimidine such as cytosine (C) and
thymine (T).

Figure 14.5 Each nucleotide is made up of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The sugar is
deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA.
The nucleotides combine with each other by covalent bonds known as phosphodiester bonds or linkages. The purines have
a double ring structure with a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Pyrimidines are smaller in size; they have
a single six-membered ring structure. The carbon atoms of the five-carbon sugar are numbered 1', 2', 3', 4', an
