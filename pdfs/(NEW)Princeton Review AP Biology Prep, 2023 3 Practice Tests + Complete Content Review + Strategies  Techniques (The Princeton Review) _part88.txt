pacing,” is probably the most important part of our overall strategy.
But before we talk strategy, let’s look at the topics that are covered by the AP Biology Exam.
Be Calculating
Students may use a four-function, scientific, or graphing calculator. However,
be aware that some models have unapproved features (like keyboards,
styluses, or wireless capability) and are not permitted, so please check the
College Board website. If you’re still unsure, you can bring two calculators so
that if one is rejected (or not functioning), you do not have to rely on a school-
provided backup that you may be unfamiliar with.
