chain. The charges
on these amino acids can change as the pH changes because of the
available H+ and OH− ions.
The last things you need to understand from this lab are the eﬀects of
changing the amount of enzyme and substrate available.
You may think that as you add more H2O2, you get more reaction. You
would be right … to a point. Eventually, no matter how much substrate
you add, the reaction maxes out. This is because there are a limited
number of enzyme molecules in the system. These enzymes can handle
only one molecule of H2O2 at a time. Think of enzymes as cashiers at the
grocery store. If several customers want to check out at the same time,
they can only be helped one at a time by any single cashier. Once all of
the cashiers are busy, a customer has to wait for the next available
cashier. Thus, H2O2 has to wait for the next available enzyme to catalyze
the reaction.
Changing the enzyme concentration aﬀects the reaction in a similar way,
except the reaction becomes almost instant
