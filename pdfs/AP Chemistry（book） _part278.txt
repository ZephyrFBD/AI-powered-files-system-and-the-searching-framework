n atoms could be 
aligned side by side across the width of a pencil line that is  
0.20 mm wide?
SOLUTION
The unknown is the number of silver (Ag) atoms. Using the  
relationship 1 Ag atom = 2.88 A
°  as a conversion factor relating 
number of atoms and distance, we start with the diameter of the 
dime, first converting this distance into angstroms and then  
using the diameter of the Ag atom to convert distance to number 
of Ag atoms:
Ag atoms = 117.9 mm2a 10-3 m

That is, 62.2 million silver atoms could sit side by side across a dime!
Four basic forces are known in nature: (1) gravitational, (2) electro-
magnetic, (3) strong nuclear, and (4) weak nuclear. Gravitational forces 
are attractive forces that act between all objects in proportion to their 
masses. Gravitational forces between atoms or between subatomic 
particles are so small that they are of no chemical significance.
Electromagnetic forces are attractive
