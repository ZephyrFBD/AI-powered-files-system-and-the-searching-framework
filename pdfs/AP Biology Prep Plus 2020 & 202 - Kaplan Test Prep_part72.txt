The hydrophilic portion of the protein would be found toward the
outside of the plasma membrane extending into the cytoplasm of the
cell or outward into the extracellular matrix. In the intact cell, the
hydrophobic portion would be contained within the hydrophobic lipid
region of the membrane. (D) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because
the interior of the cell contains cytoplasm, an aqueous solution, which
would repel the hydrophobic portion of the protein. (B) is incorrect
because the interior of the phospholipid bilayer is hydrophobic and
would repel the hydrophilic portion of the protein. (C) is incorrect
because the hydrophobic portion of the prot
