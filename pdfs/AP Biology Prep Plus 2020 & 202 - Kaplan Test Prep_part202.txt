viral mRNA and protein synthesis, replication of the genome, and
assembly and release.
Attachment and penetration by parent virion (viral particle): The specificity
of the proteins coating the capsid of the virus determines the host range
of the particular virus, or how many kinds of cells the virus can infect.
Those viruses with a wide range of surface proteins (unusual) or with
proteins that can bind to many kinds of cell surface receptors (more
common) are said to have a wide host range.
Uncoating of the viral genome: As the viral particle penetrates, the cell
traps it in a vesicle, at which point the virus will break open its capsid.
When the vesicle breaks due to viral uncoating, the inner core of the virus
with its genetic material can dump itself into the cytoplasm.
Viral mRNA and protein synthesis: DNA viruses repl
