Oxidation Numbers
Before we can identify an oxidation-reduction reaction, we must have a bookkeeping sys-
tem—a way of keeping track of electrons gained by the substance being reduced and elec-
trons lost by the substance being oxidized. The concept of oxidation numbers (also called 
oxidation states) was devised as a way of doing this. Each atom in a neutral substance or 
ion is assigned an oxidation number (also known as an oxidation state). For mon-
atomic ions, the oxidation number is the same as the charge. For neutral molecules and 
polyatomic ions, the oxidation number of a given atom is a hypothetical charge. This 
charge is assigned by artificially dividing up the electrons among
