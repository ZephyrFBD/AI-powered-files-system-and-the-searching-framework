, such as animals.
Nearly all organisms perform glycolysis, the first part of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration. One of the key enzymes
of glycolysis is pyruvate kinase. Without this enzyme, an organism will die because it is unable to convert nutrients into
the energy it needs for survival. Scientists have taken advantage of that fact by blocking pyruvate kinase in some deadly
parasites, such as the ones that cause African Sleeping Sickness and Chagas disease. Read more about this research here

7.1 | Energy in Living Systems
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What is the importance of electrons for the transfer of energy in living systems?
•
How is ATP used by the cell as an energy source?
Connection for AP® Courses
As we learned in previous chapters, living organisms require free energy to power life processes such as growth,
reproduction, movement, and active transport. ATP
