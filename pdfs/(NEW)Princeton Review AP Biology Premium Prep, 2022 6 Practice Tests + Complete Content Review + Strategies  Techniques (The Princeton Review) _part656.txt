hest mortality percentage.
d. Over many more years the number of breeding adults was measured, and it was found that over a long time the
number of breeding adults averaged around 100. Describe how this would change information in Figure 1.
Justify your answer. (3 points)
It would not change Figure 1, which measures only the percentage of surviving offspring per brood size. If the
number of surviving offspring were counted, then the information could be put on Figure 2, but just the number of
mating adults is not enough for Figure 1 or Figure 2.
Question 2
a. Explain how the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain are related and how they are affected by
exercise. (2 points)
The citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) is an important part of cell respiration. The reduced electron carriers created
during the citric acid cycle bring their electrons to the electron transport chain, which is used to generate ATP. During
exercise the muscle cells will need more energy. The process of cel
