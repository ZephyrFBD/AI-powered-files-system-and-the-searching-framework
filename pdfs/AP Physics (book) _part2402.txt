16. When you swipe a credit card, the machine sometimes fails
to read the card. What can you do differently?
(a) Swipe the card more slowly so that the reader has more
time to read the magnetic stripe.
(b) Swipe the card more quickly so that the induced emf is
higher.
(c) Swipe the card more quickly so that the induced currents
