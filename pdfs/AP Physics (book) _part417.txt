 a train going the same speed?
22. What would your bathroom scale read if you weighed your-
self on an inclined plane? Assume the mechanism functions
properly, even at an angle.
3. Matt, in the foreground of Fig. 4–39, is able to move the
large truck because 
(a) he is stronger than the truck.
(b) he is heavier in some respects than the truck.
(c) he exerts a greater force on the truck than the truck
exerts back on him.
(d) the ground exerts a greater friction force on Matt than
it does on the truck.
(e) the truck offers no resistance because its brakes are off.
MisConceptual Questions
1. A truck is traveling horizontally to the right (Fig.4–38). When
the truck starts to slow down, the crate on the (frictionless)
truck bed starts to slide. In what direction could the net
force be on the crate? 
(a) No direction. The net force is zero.
(b) Straight down (because of gravity).
(c) Straight up (the normal force).
(d) Horizontal and to the right.
(e) Horizontal and to the left.
