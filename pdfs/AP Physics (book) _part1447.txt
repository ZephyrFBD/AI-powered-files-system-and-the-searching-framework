FIGURE 13–22 Phase diagram for
water (note that the scales are not
linear).
At 1 atm, the freezing point of water is 0°C, as shown. Notice also in Fig. 13–22
that at a pressure of 1 atm, the substance is in the liquid phase if the temperature 
is between 0°C and 100°C, but is in the solid or vapor phase if the temperature is
below 0°C or above 100°C. The curve labeled s-v is the sublimation point versus
pressure curve. Sublimation refers to the process whereby at low pressures a
solid changes directly into the vapor phase without passing through the liquid
phase. For water, sublimation occurs if the pressure of the water vapor is less than
0.0060 atm. Carbon dioxide, which in the solid phase is called dry ice, sublimates
