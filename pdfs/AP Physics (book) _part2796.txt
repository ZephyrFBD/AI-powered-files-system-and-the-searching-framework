Much of the remainder of this Chapter will deal with optical devices that are used
to produce magnified images of objects. We first discuss the simple magnifier,
or magnifying glass, which is simply a converging lens (see Chapter-Opening
Photo, page 713).
How large an object appears, and how much detail we can see on it, depends
on the size of the image it makes on the retina. This, in turn, depends on the
angle subtended by the object at the eye. For example, a penny held 30 cm from
the eye looks twice as tall as one held 60 cm away because the angle it subtends is
twice as great (Fig. 25–16). When we want to examine detail on an object, we
bring it up close to our eyes so that it subtends a greater angle. However, our
eyes can accommodate only up to a point (the near point), and we will assume
a standard distance of
as the near point in what follows.
A magnifying glass allows us to place the object closer to our eye so that it
subtends a greater angle. As shown in Fig. 25–17a, the
