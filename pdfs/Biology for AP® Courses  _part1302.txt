ate between the homozygous phenotypes (e.g., a pink-flowered offspring is produced from a
cross between a red-flowered parent and a white-flowered parent). Codominance describes the simultaneous expression of
both of the alleles in the heterozygote (e.g., human blood types). It is also common for more than two alleles of a gene
to exist in a population (e.g., variations in sizes of pumpkins). In humans, as in many animals and some plants, females
have two X chromosomes, and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Genes on the X chromosome are
X-linked, and males inherit and express only one allele for the gene (e.g., hemophilia, color-blindness). Some alleles can
also be lethal, so their phenotype will never be observed.
Many human genetic disorders, including albinism, cystic fibrosis, and Huntingtonâ€™s disease can be explained on the basis
of simple Mendelian inheritance patterns created by pedigree analysis. (In later Chapters we will learn how DNA analysis
can be used to d
