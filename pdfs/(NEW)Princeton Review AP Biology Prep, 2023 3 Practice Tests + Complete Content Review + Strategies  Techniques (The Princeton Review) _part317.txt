c Errors
Sometimes, a set of chromosomes has an extra or a missing chromosome. This occurs because of nondisjunction—
chromosomes failed to separate properly during meiosis. This error, which produces the wrong number of
chromosomes in a cell, usually results in miscarriage or significant genetic defects. For example, humans typically
have two copies of each chromosome, but individuals with Down syndrome have three—instead of two—copies of
the 21st chromosome. Nondisjunction can occur in anaphase I (meaning chromosomes don’t separate when they
should), or in anaphase II (meaning chromatids don’t separate). Either one can lead to aneuploidy, or the presence
of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell.
Down syndrome is also known as trisomy 21. Two other conditions you should
be familiar with are Turner Syndrome (45XO), which occurs when a female is
missing part of or a whole X chromosome, and Klinefelter’s Syndrome
(47XXY), which occurs when a male has an extra X chromosome.
