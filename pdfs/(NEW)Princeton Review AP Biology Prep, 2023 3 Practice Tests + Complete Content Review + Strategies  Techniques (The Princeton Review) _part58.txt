PRACTICE TEST 1 EXPLANATIONS
Section I: Multiple Choice
1.
B
Adding salt would increase the osmolality (a similar measure to osmolarity) and since Organism 4 is an
osmoconformer it would change its intracellular osmolality/osmolarity to mimic the surroundings. This means
that it would increase its osmolality and maintain it unless further changes are made to the system.
2.
B
The only choice that has direct ties to maintaining osmotic balance is the sodium-potassium pump.
3.
D
Since the organisms mimic their surroundings, the only choice that would decrease their osmolalities would be
one that decreases the osmolality of their surrounding tank. Choice (A) increases
