the digestion of starches and
proteins(which began in the mouth and stomach, respectively) as well as all remaining food types (including fats
and nucleotides). Enzymes for these various processes originate from the following sources:
Small intestine. The wall of the small intestine is the source of various enzymes, including various proteases
(enzymes that break down proteins), sucrase, maltase, and lactase (for the digestion of disaccharides) and
phosphatases (for the digestion of nucleotides).
Pancreas. The pancreas produces various enzymes, including trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen (proteases),
lipase (digestion of fats), and pancreatic amylase (digestion of starch). These and other enzymes, packaged in an
alkaline solution that serves to neutralize the HCl in the chyme, enter the duodenum through the pancreatic duct.
Trypsinogen is converted to its active form, trypsin, by a protease secreted by the small intestines. Trypsin then
converts chymotrypsinogen to its active form, chym
