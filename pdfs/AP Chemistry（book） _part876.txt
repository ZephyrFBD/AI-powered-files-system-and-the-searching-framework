rbitals of the hydrogen atom can be used 
to describe the arrangements of electrons 
in many-electron atoms. Using patterns in 
orbital energies as well as some fundamental 
characteristics of electrons described by Hund’s 
rule, we determine how electrons are distributed 
among the orbitals (electron configurations).
 
6.9  ▶  Electron Configurations and the 
Periodic Table Recognize that the 
electron configuration of an atom is related 
to the location of the element in the periodic 
table.
WHAT’S AHEAD
The beginning of the twentieth 
century was truly one of the most revolutionary 
periods of scientific discovery. Two theoretical 
developments caused dramatic changes in our 
view of the universe. The first, Einstein’s theory 
of relativity, forever changed our views of the 
relationships between space and time. The 
second—which will be the focus of this chapter—
is quantum theory, which explains much of the 
behavior of electrons in atoms.
Quantum theory led to the explosion in te
