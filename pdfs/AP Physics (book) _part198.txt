is the change of velocity during the time interval 
Instantaneous acceleration is the average acceleration taken
over an infinitesimally short time interval.
If an object has position 
and velocity 
at time
and
moves in a straight line with constant acceleration, the velocity 
and position x at a later time are related to the acceleration a,
the initial position 
and the initial velocity 
by Eqs. 2–11:

1. Does a car speedometer measure speed, velocity, or both?
Explain.
2. When an object moves with constant velocity, does its
average velocity during any time interval differ from its
instantaneous velocity at any instant? Explain.
3. If one object has a greater speed than a second object,
does the first necessarily have a greater acceleration?
Explain, using examples.
4. Compare the acceleration of a motorcycle that accelerates
from 
to 
with the acceleration o
