ctors in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that instruct peptidyl
transferase to add a water molecule to the carboxyl end of the P-site amino acid. This reaction forces the P-site amino acid
to detach from its tRNA, and the newly made protein is released. The small and large ribosomal subunits dissociate from the
mRNA and from each other; they are recruited almost immediately into another translation initiation complex. After many
ribosomes have completed translation, the mRNA is degraded so the nucleotides can be reused in another transcription
reaction.
Protein Folding, Modification, and Targeting
During and after translation, individual amino acids may be chemically modified, signal sequences may be appended,
and the new protein “folds” into a distinct three-dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions. A signal
sequence is a short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment. These sequences at the
amino end or the carboxyl end of the p
