(a) Describe the type of selection (directional, stabilizing, or disruptive) that is caused by the presence of C.
alta.
(b) On the axes provided, construct a graph of the mean number of spots per male guppy for each group.
Include 95% confidence intervals on your graph.
(c) Use the graph you constructed in part (b) to make a claim about the mean number of spots per male guppy
in the no-predator environment as compared to the mean number of spots per male guppy in the
environment with C. alta. Support your claim with evidence from the graph.
(d) As a follow-up experiment, some of the guppies in the environment with C. alta were removed and placed
in an environment with no predators. They were allowed to reproduce for 20 generations. Predict what
you would expect to happen to the mean number of
