ts momentum, mv: l = h>mv.
Discovery of the wave properties of the electron led to Heisen-
bergâ€™s uncertainty principle, which states that there is an inherent limit 
to the accuracy with which the position and momentum of a particle 
can be measured simultaneously.
QUANTUM MECHANICS AND ORBITALS (SECTION 6.5) In the 
quantum-mechanical model of the hydrogen atom, the behavior 
of the electron is described by mathematical functions called wave 
functions, denoted with the Greek letter c. Each allowed wave func-
tion has a precisely known energy, but the location of the electron 
cannot be determined exactly; rather, the probability of it being at 
a particular point in space is given by the probability density, c2. The 
SOLUTION
(a) The two isotopes of boron differ in the number of neutrons in the 
nucleus. 
 (Sections 2.3 and 2.4) Each of the isotopes contains 
five protons, but 10B contains five neutrons, whereas 11B contains 
six neutrons. The two isotopes of boron have identical el
