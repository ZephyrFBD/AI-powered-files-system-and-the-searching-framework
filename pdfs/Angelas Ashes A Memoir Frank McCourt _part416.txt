nt in the 
 
 room and it’s the priest, Father Gorey, from the Confraternity saying 
 
 Mass at a table in the corner. I drift off again and now they’re waking 
 
 me and pulling down the bedclothes. Father Gorey is touching me with 
 
 oil and praying in Latin. I know it’s Extreme Unction and that means 
 
 I’m going to die and I don’t care.They wake me again to receive Communion. 
 
 I don’t want it, I’m afraid I might get sick. I keep the wafer on 
 
 my tongue and fall asleep and when I wake up again it’s gone. 
 
  
  
 It’s dark and Dr. Campbell is sitting by my bed. He’s holding my 
 
 wrist and looking at his watch. He has red hair and glasses and he always 
 
 smiles when he talks to me. He sits now and hums and looks out the 
 
 window. His eyes close and he snores a little. He tilts over on the chair 
 
 and farts and smiles to himself and I know now I’m going to get better 
 
 because a doctor would never fart in the presence of a dying boy.
