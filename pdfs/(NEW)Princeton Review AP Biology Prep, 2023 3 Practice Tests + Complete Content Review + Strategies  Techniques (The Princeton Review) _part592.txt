ucers. Population B is most likely composed of producers
because they have the largest biomass.
48. B
An increase in the number of organisms in population C would most likely lead to a decrease in the biomass of
B because population B is the food source for population C. Make a pyramid based on the biomasses given. If
population C increases, population B will decrease. Eliminate (A) and (C), as you cannot necessarily predict
what will happen to the biomass of populations that are above population C. Choice (D) can also be eliminated
because the food source available to population C would most likely decrease, not increase.
49. B
Chromosomes replicate during interphase, the S phase. Choices (A) and (C) are incorrect because during G1
and G2, the cell makes protein and performs other metabolic duties.
50. A
The first sign of prophase in mammalian cells is the appearance of chromosomes, which are usually invisible.
They are condensed at the start of mitosis.
51. D
To induce cell cycle pro
