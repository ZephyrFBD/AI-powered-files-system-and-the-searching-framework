 and feeding behaviors. For instance, crickets suppress
their calling behavior to avoid acoustically-hunting parasites. Invasive
species may dominate in a new ecosystem because they grow and
reproduce rapidly and/or lack natural enemies or pests. As a result, the
invasive species will displace the native species, as illustrated by both
kudzu and Dutch elm disease. Kudzu is an invasive plant that has
replaced the diverse ecosystem in the southeastern United States with a
monoculture. Dutch elm disease, caused by the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi
and transmitted to trees by elm bark beetles, has killed native
populations of elms that are not resistant to the disease. Indirect threats
include changing the food web by destroying or replacing native food
sources, decreasing the abundance and diversity of native species, and
changing the environment. For example, invasive plants can modify
nutrient availability (making an environment less inhabitable) by
aï¬€ecting soil pH or causing erosion (because
