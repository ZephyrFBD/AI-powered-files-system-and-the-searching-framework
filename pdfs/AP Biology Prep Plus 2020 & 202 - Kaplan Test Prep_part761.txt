morphological analysis is closer to reality. Therefore, (B) and (C) are
incorrect.

Evaluate each answer choice. According to the figure, parasitism did
not arise only once because there are multiple clades with parasitic
bees. In addition to those under Nomadinae, there are those under
Apinae such as Ctenoplectrini, Euglossini, Protepeolini, and Melectini,
so (A) is incorrect. The eusocial bees shown all had ancestors that were
primitively eusocial. Thus, (B) is the correct answer. (C) is incorrect
because the majority of the parasitic clades shown did not arise from a
eusocial common ancestor. (D) is also incorrect because the majority
of the solitary clades shown did not arise from a eusocial common
ancestor.

According to the tree, Drosophila melanogaster diverged from other
Drosophila (D. yakuba and D. santomea) at the node labeled 16.78
million years ago, so (B) is correct.
