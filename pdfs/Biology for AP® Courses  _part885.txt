articular hydrogen identified.
RH + NAD+ â†’NADH + R
a.
RH acts as a reducing agent and donates its
electrons to the oxidizing agent NAD+ ,
forming NADH and R .
b.
NAD+ , the oxidizing agent, donates its
electrons to the reducing agent RH , forming R
and NADH .
c.
RH acts as an oxidizing agent and donates
electrons to the reducing agent NAD+ ,
producing NADH and R .
d.
NAD+ , the reducing agent, accepts electrons
from the oxidizing agent RH , producing
NADH and R .
28. Nearly all organisms on earth carry out some form of
glycolysis. How does this fact support or not support the
assertion that glycolysis is one of the oldest metabolic
pathways?
a.
To be present in so many different organisms,
glycolysis was probably present in a common
ancestor rather than evolving many separate
times.
b.
Glycolysis is present in nearly all organisms
because it is an advanced and recently evolved
pathway that has been widely used as it is so
beneficial.
c.
Glycolysis is absent in a few higher organisms.
