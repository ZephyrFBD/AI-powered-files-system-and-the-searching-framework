d nutrients from the soil. Root
hairs are finger-like extensions of root epidermal cells near the tip
of each root. By increasing the root’s surface area, they greatly
enhance the absorption of water and minerals from the soil into the
plant.
Transport tissue (xylem and phloem) can move fluids great
distances.

Stomates open to exchange photosynthetic gases and close to
minimize excessive water loss.
The waxy coating on the leaves, cutin, helps prevents excess water
loss from the leaves.
In some plants, gametes and zygotes form within a protective jacket
of cells called gametangia that prevents drying out.
Sporopollenin, a tough polymer, is resistant to almost all kinds of
environmental damage and protects plants in a harsh terrestrial
environment. It is found in the walls of spores and pollen.
Seeds and pollen are a means of dispersing offspring. They also
have a protective coat that prevents desiccation.
