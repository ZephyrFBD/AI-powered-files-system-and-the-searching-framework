electronic device, is because
capacitors may still be carrying charge even if the external power is turned off.
On the other hand, the basis of a heart defibrillator is a capacitor charged to
a high voltage. A heart attack can be characterized by fast irregular beating of
the heart, known as ventricular (or cardiac) fibrillation. The heart then does not
pump blood to the rest of the body properly, and if the interruption lasts for long,
death results. A sudden, brief jolt of charge through the heart from a defibrillator
can cause complete heart stoppage, sometimes followed by a resumption of normal
beating. The defibrillator capacitor is charged to a high voltage, typically a few
thousand volts, and is allowed to discharge very rapidly through the heart via a
pair of wide contacts known as “pads” or “paddles” that spread out the current
over the chest (Fig. 17–21).
