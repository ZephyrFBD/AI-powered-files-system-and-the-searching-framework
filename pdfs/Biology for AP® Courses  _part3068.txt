le with the presynaptic membrane causes neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft, the
extracellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, as illustrated in Figure 26.15. The
neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane.

Figure 26.15 Communication at chemical synapses requires release of neurotransmitters. When the presynaptic
membrane is depolarized, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open and allow Ca2+ to enter the cell. The calcium entry
causes synaptic vesicles to fuse with the membrane and release neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft.
The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to ligand-gated ion channels in the postsynaptic
membrane, resulting in a localized depolarization or hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron.
The binding of a specific neurotransmitter causes particular ion channels, in this case ligand
