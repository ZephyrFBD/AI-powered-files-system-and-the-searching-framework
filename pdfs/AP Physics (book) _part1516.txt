plicity in nature can be expressed in the equation
(14;2)
where c is a quantity characteristic of the material called its specific heat.
Because
specific heat is specified in units† of 
(the proper
SI unit) or 
For water at 15°C and a constant pressure of 1 atm,
or 
since, by definition of the cal and
the joule, it takes 1 kcal of heat to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 C°.
Table 14–1 gives the values of specific heat for other substances at 20°C. The values
of c depend to some extent on temperature (as well as slightly on pressure), but
for temperature changes that are not too great, c can often be considered constant.
1.00 kcalkgC°,
c = 4.186 * 103 JkgC°

If the iron vat in part (a) of Example 14–2 had been cooled from 90°C to 10°C,
720 kJ of heat would have flowed out of the iron. In other words, Eq.14–2 is valid for
heat flow either in or out, with a corresponding increase or decrease in temperature.
