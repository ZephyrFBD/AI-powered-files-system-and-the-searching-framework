 be dead for the want of bread. 
 
 I put on my shoes and run quickly through the streets of Limerick 
 
 to keep myself warm against the February frost.You can look in people’s 
 
 windows and see how cozy it is in their kitchens with fires glowing 
 
 or ranges black and hot everything bright in the electric light cups 
 
 and saucers on the tables with plates of sliced bread pounds of butter 
 
 jars of jam smells of fried eggs and rashers coming through the windows 
 
 enough to make the water run in your mouth and families sitting there 
 
 digging in all smiling the mother crisp and clean in her apron everyone 
 
 washed and the Sacred Heart of Jesus looking down on them from the 
 
 wall suffering and sad but still happy with all that food and light and 
 
 good Catholics at their breakfast. 
 
 I try to find music in my own head but all I can find is my mother 
 
  
  
 moaning for lemonade.
