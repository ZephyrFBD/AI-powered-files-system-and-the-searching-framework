1. 
The shell with principal quantum number n consists of exactly 
n subshells. Each subshell corresponds to a different allowed 
value of l from 0 to 1n - 12. Thus, the first shell 1n = 12 
consists of only one subshell, the 1s 1l = 02; the second 
shell 1n = 22 consists of two subshells, the 2s 1l = 02 and 
2p 1l = 12; the third shell consists of three subshells, 3s, 3p, 
and 3d, and so forth.
2. 
Each subshell consists of a specific number of orbitals. Each  
orbital 
corresponds to a different allowed value of ml. For a given value 
of l, there are 12l + 12 allowed values of ml, ranging from -l to 
+l. Thus, each s 1l = 02 subshell consists of one orbital; each 
p 1l = 12 subshell consists of three orbitals; each d 1l = 22 
 
subshell consists of five orbitals, and so forth.
3. 
The total number of orbitals in a shell is n2, where n is the princi-
pal quantum number of the shell. The resulting number of or-
bitals for the shells—1, 4, 9, 16—is related to a pattern seen
