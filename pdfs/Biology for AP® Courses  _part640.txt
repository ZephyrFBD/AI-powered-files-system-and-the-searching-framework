 maintain
homeostasis, all organisms, including the simple bacterium
E. coli, must sense the temperature of the environment and
adapt to changes.
Samples of E. coli were grown at four different
temperatures, and then researchers determined the fatty
acid composition of their plasma membranes. The data are
shown in the following table.

Table 5.3
Fatty acid compositions of the plasma membrane of E. coli
were incubated at the temperatures shown. Myristic and
palmitic acid are saturated, while palmitoleic and oleic
acids each have one C-C double bond.
A.
Analyze the data to calculate the ratio of the
fraction of unsaturated (U) to the fraction of
saturated (S) fatty acids in the plasma
membrane, and complete the table.
B.
Graph the ratio U/S versus growth temperature.
C.
Explain the response of E. coli to the
temperature of the enviro
