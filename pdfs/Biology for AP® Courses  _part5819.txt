nd Wojcicki expressed support for
tech platforms like hers to censor content that is ‘technically legal but
could be harmful’. Who decides what is ‘harmful’? She does and
they do. ‘Harmful’ will be whatever the Cult doesn’t want people to
see and we have legislation proposed by the UK government that
would censor content on the basis of ‘harm’ no maĴer if the
information is fair, legal and provably true. Make that especially if it
is fair, legal and provably true. Wojcicki called for a global coalition
to be formed to enforce content moderation standards through
automated censorship. This is a woman and mega-censor so self-
deluded that she shamelessly accepted a ‘free expression’ award –
Wojcicki – in an event sponsored by her own YouTube. They have no
shame and no self-awareness.
You know that ‘Covid’ is a scam and Wojcicki a Cult operative
when YouTube is censoring medical and scientiﬁc opinion purely on
the grounds of whether it supports or opposes the Cult ‘Covid’
narrative. Flori
