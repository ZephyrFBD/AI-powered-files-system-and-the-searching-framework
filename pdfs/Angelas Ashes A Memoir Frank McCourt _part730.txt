fear of consumption and 
 
 the shilling tip and her green eyes and she’s on the sofa don’t stop or I’ll 
 
 die and she’s crying and I’m crying for I don’t know what’s happening 
 
 323 
 
 to me if I’m killing myself catching consumption from her mouth I’m 
 
 riding to heaven I’m falling off a cliff and if this is a sin I don’t give a 
 
 fiddler’s fart. 
 
 We take our ease on the sofa a while till she says, Don’t you have 
 
 more telegrams to deliver? and when we sit up she gives a little cry, Oh, 
 
 I’m bleeding. 
 
  
  
 What’s up with you? 
 
 I think it’s because it’s the first time. 
 
 I tell her,Wait a minute. I bring the bottle from the kitchen and 
 
 splash the iodine on her injury. She leaps from the sofa, dances around 
 
 the parlor like a wild one and runs into the kitchen to douse herself 
 
 with water. After she dries herself she says, Lord, you’re very innocent. 
 
 You’re not supposed to be pouring iodine on girls like that. 
 
 I thought you were cut.
