■ THE INVESTIGATIONS 
■ Getting Started: Prelab Assessment 
The Getting Started section of the student version of this investigation provides students 
with three activities to review or introduce key concepts and principles relating to 
restriction enzymes, DNA mapping using restriction enzymes, and analysis of DNA 
using gel electrophoresis. These activities encou
