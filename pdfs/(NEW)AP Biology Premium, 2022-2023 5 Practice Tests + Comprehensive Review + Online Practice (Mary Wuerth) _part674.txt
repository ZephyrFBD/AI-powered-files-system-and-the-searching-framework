 strand of DNA is synthesized continuously, not
discontinuously. DNA polymerase is used on both strands to synthesize DNA, so choice (C) is incorrect.
Lagging strand and leading strand synthesis occur simultaneously, so choice (D) is incorrect.
40. (D) RNA polymerase is the enzyme that transcribes RNA from a DNA template. Choice (A) is incorrect
because helicase is the enzyme that unwinds DNA at the start of DNA replication. Ligase is used to join DNA
fragments (for example, the Okazaki fragments created during the discontinuous replication of the lagging
strand of DNA), so choice (B) is incorrect. DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA during DNA replication, so
choice (C) is incorrect.
41. (C) Introns are found in eukaryotes (and in archaea). Introns are not translated, so choice (A) is incorrect.
Although introns are not directly converted into proteins, some introns may have a function in gene regulation,
so choice (B) is incorrect. Eukaryotes do contain introns, so choice (D) is incorrect
