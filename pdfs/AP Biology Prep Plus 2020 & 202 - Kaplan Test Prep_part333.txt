otein kinase A, decreasing interaction between actin and myosin and
thereby indirectly decreasing muscle contraction. Therefore, (C) is
correct. (A) is incorrect because acetylcholine binds to an ion-gated
channel while epinephrine binds to a G-protein-coupled receptor, so
the two could not compete for the same receptor. (B) is incorrect
because protein kinase A does not inhibit glucose synthesis, according
to the question stem. (D) is incorrect because the binding of
epinephrine to the receptor activates the adenylyl cyclase, as noted in
the question stem.

The tyrosine kinase domain is what makes RTKs distinctive. The
presence of sequences encoding a putative tyrosine kinase domain in
the protists would be a strong indication that the protein is in fact a
receptor tyrosine kinase. (C) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because
ligand regions are determined by the ligands they bind, so they would
not be conserved unless they bind to the same ligand. (B) is i
