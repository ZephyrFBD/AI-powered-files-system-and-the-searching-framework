diploid;
though at this point, each chromosome would consist of only a single chromatid.
The entire cell cycle includes both mitosis and interphase. Interphase is
 
a period of growth and is divided into three stages, identified G1 S, and G2. The G1 phase describes the first period
of growth following
 
mitosis. During the S phase, a second DNA molecule (chromatid) is
 
replicated from each chromosome. During the G2 phase, the cell
prepares for mitosis. The M phase describes mitosis and cytokinesis. b. There are various factors that induce a cell
to divide. Cell size is functionally limited by surface-to volume and genome-to-volume ratios. As the surface-to-
volume ratio becomes progressively smaller as the cell grows, the ability of the plasma membrane to provide a
surface large enough to meet the import and export requirements of the cell diminishes. Also, when the cell
increases in size, the amount of genetic material remains the same. As a result, the ability of the nucleus to cont
