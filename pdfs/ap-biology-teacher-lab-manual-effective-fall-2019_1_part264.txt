rom the BLAST queries? 
•  How did the students handle any disagreements about the cladogram? Was their 
reasoning evidence based? 
•  Did students have an adequate background in genetics to understand the data they 
had to analyze in this investigation? 
•  Are students able to construct their own cladograms using provided data?

Determine if students truly understand the evolutionary patterns seen in cladograms 
by asking them to include concepts such as speciation, extinction, and natural selection 
when describing a particular cladogram.
