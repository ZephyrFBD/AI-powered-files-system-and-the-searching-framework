 called oxytocin to be released. In turn, oxytocin triggers the motherâ€™s
womb muscles to contract, pushing the baby harder against the womb. This
causes a cycle: further stretching of the womb, further oxytocin release, more
womb contractions, and so on, until the baby is delivered.
Cell Communication in Plants
Plants do not have a nervous system but can produce several proteins found in animal nervous systems, such as
certain neurotransmitter receptors. Plants can also generate electrical signals in response to environmental stimuli,
and this can affect flowering, respiration, photosynthesis, and wound healing. Light receptors are common in plants
and help link environmental cues to biological processes such as seed germination, the timing of flowering, and
chlorophyll production. Some plants can also use chemicals to communicate with nearby plants. For example,
wounded tomatoes produce a volatile chemical as an alarm signal. This warns nearby plants and allows them to
prepare a defen
