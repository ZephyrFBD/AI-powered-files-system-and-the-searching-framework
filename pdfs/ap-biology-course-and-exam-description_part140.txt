Feedback
ENE-3.B
Explain how negative 
feedback helps to maintain 
homeostasis.
ENE-3.C
Explain how positive 
feedback affects 
homeostasis.
ENE-3.B.1
Negative feedback mechanisms maintain 
homeostasis for a particular condition by 
regulating physiological processes. If a system 
is perturbed, negative feedback mechanisms 
return the system back to its target set point. 
These processes operate at the molecular and 
cellular levels.
ENE-3.C.1
Positive feedback mechanisms amplify 
responses and processes in biological 
organisms. The variable initiating the response 
is moved farther away from the initial set point. 
Amplification occurs when the stimulus is further 
activated, which, in turn, initiates an additional 
response that produces system change.
