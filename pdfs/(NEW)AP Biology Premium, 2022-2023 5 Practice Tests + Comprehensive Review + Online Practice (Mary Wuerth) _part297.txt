 is an independent event from inheriting the allele for wrinkled peas. This is because
the gene for flower color in peas is on a separate chromosome than the gene for pea shape. These chromosomes
assort independently in metaphase I of meiosis.
A pedigree is a chart that illustrates the inheritance of a trait through several generations. Horizontal lines
between two individuals in a pedigree show that those individuals have had offspring together. Offspring of these
individuals are indicated by vertical lines. Circles typically represent females, and squares represent males. Circles
or squares that are shaded usually represent individuals who possess the trait shown in the pedigree.
Examining the pattern of inheritance of a trait shown in a pedigree can give clues to the traitâ€™s possible mode of
inheritance. Dominant traits tend to be expressed in at least one parent and their offspring because only one allele for
the trait is required for it to be expressed. Recessive traits often will
