le of the pump, the net eﬀect is the removal of one solute
particle, so activating the pump (and consuming ATP) would reduce the solute gradient
between the cell and the environment and mitigate the swelling. Thus, when placed in a
hypotonic environment, ATP consumption will immediately increase. (C) is correct. (D) is
incorrect because the question specifically asks about an immediate eﬀect.

While there are some subtle diﬀerences between the two phylogenetic trees, the main
diﬀerence is in the relationship among the bilaterians. The morphology-based tree
divides the bilaterians into two taxa: deuterostomes and protostomes. In contrast, the
tree based on molecular data omits Protostomia, replacing it with Lophotrochozoa and
Ecdysozoa, providing a total of three branches for the bilaterians. (B) is thus correct. (A)
and (C) do represent diﬀerences, but they are fairly small in comparison. Both trees show
a convergence on a single ancestor, ruling out (D).
