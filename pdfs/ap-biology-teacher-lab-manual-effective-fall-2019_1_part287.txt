water movement in the cell by the cell wall. This resistance is called turgor pressure. 
The terms hypertonic, hypotonic, and isotonic are used to describe solutions separated 
by selectively permeable membranes. A hypertonic solution has a higher solute 
concentration and a lower water potential as compared to the other solution; therefore, 
water will move into the hypertonic solution through the membrane. A hypotonic 
solution has a lower solute concentration and a higher water potential than the solution 
on the other side of the membrane; water will move down its concentration gradient into 
the other solution. Isotonic solutions have equal water potential.
The movement of solutes and water across cellular membranes is an overarching 
concept. Cells must maintain their internal environments and control solute movement. 
These concepts can be illustrated using model systems and living cells. Students will 
revisit the concepts of osmosis and water potential when they investigate t
