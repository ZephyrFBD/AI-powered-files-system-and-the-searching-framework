of 5 m and a frequency of 3 Hz.
Since three crests pass a given point per second, and the crests are 5 m apart, the
first crest (or any other part of the wave) must travel a distance of 15 m during
the 1 s. So the wave speed is 
EXERCISE H You notice a water wave pass by the end of a pier, with about 0.5 s 
between crests. Therefore (a) the frequency is 0.5 Hz; (b) the velocity is 
(c) the
wavelength is 0.5 m; (d) the period is 0.5 s.

1–8 Types of Waves and Their Speeds:
Transverse and Longitudinal
When a wave travels down a cord—say, from left to right as in Fig. 11–22—the
particles of the cord vibrate back and forth in a direction transverse (that is, perpen-
dicular) to the motion of the wave itself. Such a wave is called a transverse wave
(Fig.11–25a). There exists another type of wave known as a longitudinal wave. In a
longitudinal wave, the vibration of the particles of the medium is along the direction
of the wave’s motion. Longitudinal waves are readily formed on a stretched
