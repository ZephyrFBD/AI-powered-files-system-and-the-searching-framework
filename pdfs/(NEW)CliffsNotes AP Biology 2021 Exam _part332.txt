script, different mRNAs can be produced, each coding for a different
protein product.

Translation
After transcription, the mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomal subunits are transported across the nuclear envelope and into
the cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, a specific amino acid attaches to each of the tRNAs using energy from ATP.
As an introduction, this is what happens during translation:
1. The mRNA attaches to the ribosome.
2. The sequence of codons on the mRNA determines the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide to be
synthesized.
 
3. One by one, a tRNA brings an amino acid to the ribosome such that the anticodon of the tRNA base-pairs with the
codon of the mRNA. 4. The newly-arrived amino acid is attached with a peptide bond to other amino acids already
present.
 
5. A tRNA is released from the ribosome.
 
6. The process is repeated until a “stop” codon on the mRNA has been reached and the completed polypeptide is
released.
 
The details are slightly more complicated. As
