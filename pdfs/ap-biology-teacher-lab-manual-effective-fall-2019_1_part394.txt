Microrespirometers in Two Antarctic Terrestrial Arthropods: Adult Females of the Ixodid 
Tick, Ixodes uriae, and Chironomid Larvae, Belgica antarctica. Data from Lee and Baust 
(1982 a, b). 
Note that the points plotted are respiration rates at various temperatures. Your students 
might not consider the number of treatments or replications typical of even small 
investigations. You might consider sharing this graph or similar ones w
