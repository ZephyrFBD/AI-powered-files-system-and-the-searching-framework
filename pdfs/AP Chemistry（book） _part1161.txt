mic radii increase as we go down 
a column, we would expect the radius of Bi to be greater than 
that of Sb, which is 1.39 Å. We also know that atomic radii 
generally decrease as we proceed from left to right in a period.  
Tables 7.5 and 7.6 each give an element in the same period, 
namely, Ba and Po. We would therefore expect that the radius 
of Bi is smaller than that of Ba (2.15 Å) and larger than that of 
Po (1.40 Å). We also see that in other periods, the difference 
in radius between the neighboring group 5A and group 6A 
elements is relatively small. We might therefore expect that 
the radius of Bi is slightly larger than that of Po—much closer 
to the radius of Po than to the radius of Ba. The tabulated 
value for the atomic radius on Bi is 1.48 Å, in accord with our 
expectations.
(b) The general increase in radius with increasing atomic 
number in the group 5A elements occurs because addi-
tional shells of electrons are being added, with corre-
sponding increases in nuclear
