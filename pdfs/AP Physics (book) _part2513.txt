e also can see that the height of the image is the same
as that of the object.
The light rays do not actually pass through the image location itself in Fig.23–7.
(Note where the red lines are dashed to show they are our projections, not rays.)
The image would not appear on paper or film placed at the location of the image.
Therefore, it is called a virtual image. This is to distinguish it from a real image
in which the light does pass through the image and which therefore could appear
on a white surface, or on film or on an electronic sensor placed at the image position.
Our eyes can see both real and virtual images, as long as the diverging rays enter
our pupils. We will see that curved mirrors and lenses can form real images, as well
as virtual. A movie projector lens, for example, produces a real image that is
visible on the screen.
