 receptor proteins, not to membrane
phospholipids.
5. (B) If an antibody binds to the receptor, the ligand will be prevented from binding to the receptor, and the
signaling process will not occur. Choice (A) is incorrect because the result will be decreased, not increased,
stimulation of the target cell. The effect of the antibody will be decreased stimulation of the target cell, so
choice (C) is also incorrect. Since the antibody is preventing the ligand from binding to the receptor, no
stimulation of gene expression could be triggered, making choice (D) incorrect as well.
6. (C) Both calcium ions and cyclic AMP function as secondary messengers during cell signaling. Ligands bind to
the receptor to start the cell signaling process; neither calcium ions nor cAMP do this, so choice (A) is incorrect.
Receptor proteins and protein kinases are proteins, but neither calcium ions nor cAMP are proteins. So choices
(B) and (D) are incorrect.
7. (C) Protein phosphatases remove phosphate groups
