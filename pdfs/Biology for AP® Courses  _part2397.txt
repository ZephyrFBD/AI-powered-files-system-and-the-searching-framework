jor disease. Viral vaccines may also be used in active
viral infections, boosting the ability of the immune system to control or destroy the virus. A series of antiviral drugs that
target enzymes and other protein products of viral genes have been developed and used with mixed success. Combinations
of anti-HIV drugs have been used to effectively control the virus, extending the lifespans of infected individuals. Viruses
have many uses in medicines, such as in the treatment of genetic disorders, cancer, and bacterial infections.
21.4 Other Acellular Entities: Prions and Viroids
Prions are infectious agents that consist of protein, but no DNA or RNA, and seem to produce their deadly effects by
duplicating their shapes and accumulating in tissues. They are thought to contribute to several progressive brain disorders,
including mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Viroids are single-stranded RNA pathogens that infect plants.
Their presence can have a severe impact on the agricult
