Oncogenic viruses in animals can cause cancer by interfering with the regulation of the host cell cycle. Plant viruses can
cause considerable economic damage caused by poor crop quality and quantity globally.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with o
