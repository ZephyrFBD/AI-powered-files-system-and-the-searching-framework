ormone types (polar and nonpolar) can have the end
result of activating transcription. (B) is correct since polar hormones cannot enter through the cell
membrane and must have a receptor on the outside of the cell. (C) is incorrect because the 620 amino
acids are actually part of the receptor. (D) is incorrect because steroid hormones enter cells and bind to
a cytoplasmic receptor.
3. The correct answer is (A). Here is the chi-square formula. It will be given to you on the exam’s
formula sheet. o = observed data while e = expected data.
The way to calculate a chi-square is for each category, take the difference between observed number
(which are the 86 long-tailed and 14 short-tailed mice) and the expected number (which is 75 and 25 if
the trait were autosomal dominant). You then square each number and divide by the expected number
for each category. The 2 numbers are then added together. So for the long-tailed mice, 86 – 75 = 11.
11 squared is 121. 121 divided by 75 = 1.62. For the sh
