lity, and dominate
other plants in this ecosystem to obtain sunlight. Even in smaller numbers, primary producers in forests are still capable of
supporting other trophic levels.
Another way to visualize ecosystem structure is with pyramids of biomass. This pyramid measures the amount of energy
converted into living tissue at the different trophic levels. Using the Silver Springs ecosystem example, this data exhibits an
upright biomass pyramid (Figure 37.10), whereas the pyramid from the English Channel example is inverted. The plants
(primary producers) of the Silver Springs ecosystem make up a large percentage of the biomass found there. However, the
phytoplankton in the English Channel example make up less biomass than the primary consumers, the zooplankton. As
with inverted pyramids of numbers, this inverted pyramid is not due to a lack of productivity from the primary producers,
but results from the high turnover rate of the phytoplankton. The phytoplankton are consumed rapidly by
