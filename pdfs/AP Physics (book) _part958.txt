s as much as wire A.
(c) Wire A stretches twice as much as wire B. (d) Wire A stretches four times as much as
wire B. (e) Both wires stretch the same amount.
The value of Young’s modulus for various materials is given in Table 9–1 (the
shear modulus and bulk modulus in this Table are discussed later in this Section).
Because E is a property only of the material and is independent of the object’s size
or shape, Eq. 9–4 is far more useful for practical calculation than Eq. 9–3.
