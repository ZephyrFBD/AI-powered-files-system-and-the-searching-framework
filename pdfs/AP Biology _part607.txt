ddition, your teacher may present some of this material to be used for
what the College Board calls “illustrative examples” to help you

Remember, this chapter consists of illustrative examples. Although these topics are not
required for the AP exam, studying them will broaden your understanding of Biology
and provide you with examples to use as you write your answers to the free-response
questions.
