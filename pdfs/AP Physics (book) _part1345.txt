, the
sound can be heard at the other cup (Fig. 12–29). Explain
clearly how the sound wave travels from one cup to the other.
14. Consider the two waves shown in Fig.12–31. Each wave can
be thought of as a superposition of two sound waves with
slightly different frequencies, as in Fig. 12–18. In which of
the waves, (a) or (b), are the two component frequencies
farther apart? Explain.

4. When a sound wave passes from air into water, do you
expect the frequency or wavelength to change?
5. What evidence can you give that the speed of sound in air
does not depend significantly on frequency?
6. The voice of a person who has inhaled helium sounds very
high-pitched. Why?
7. How will the air temperature in a room affect the pitch of
organ pipes?
8. Explain how a tube might be used as a filter to reduce the
amplitude of sounds in various frequency ranges. (An
example is a car muffler.)
9. Why are the frets on a guitar (Fig
