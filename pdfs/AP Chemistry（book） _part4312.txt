l reaction. 
(Section 14.6)
intermetallic compound A homogeneous alloy with definite 
properties and a fixed composition. (Section 12.3)
intermolecular forces Forces that exist between molecules. 
(Chapter 11: Introduction)
internal energy The sum of all the kinetic and potential energies 
of the components of the system. When a system undergoes a 
change, the change in internal energy, ∆E, is defined as the heat, 
q, added to the system, plus the work, w, done on the system by 
its surroundings: ∆E = q + w. (Section 5.2)
interstitial alloy An alloy formed when solute atoms occupy 
interstitial positions in the “holes” between solvent atoms. 
(Section 12.3)
ion Electrically charged atom or group of atoms (polyatomic 
ion); ions can be positively or negatively charged, depending on 
whether electrons are lost (positive) or gained (negative) by the 
atoms. (Section 2.7)
ion–dipole force The force that exists between an ion and a 
polar molecule that possesses a permanent dipole moment.
