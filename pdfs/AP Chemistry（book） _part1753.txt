the attractive forces that lead to the liquid state regardless of how much the substance is 
compressed to bring the molecules closer together. The greater the intermolecular forces, the 
higher the critical temperature of a substance.
Several experimentally determined critical temperatures and pressures are listed in 
Table 11.5. Notice that nonpolar, low-molecular-weight substances, which have weak 
intermolecular attractions, have lower critical temperatures and pressures than sub-
stances that are polar or of higher molecular weight. Notice also that water and ammonia 
have exceptionally high critical temperatures and pressures as a consequence of strong 
intermolecular hydrogen-bonding forces.
Because they provide information about the conditions under which gases liquefy, 
critical temperatures and pressures are often of considerable importance to engineers
