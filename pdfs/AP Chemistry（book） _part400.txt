A Step-by-Step Example of Balancing a Chemical Equation 
To illustrate the process of balancing an equation, consider the reaction that occurs when 
methane 1CH42, the principal component of natural gas, burns in air to produce carbon 
dioxide gas 1CO22 and water vapor 1H2O2 (Figure 3.4). Both products contain oxygen at-
oms that come from O2 in the air. Thus, O2 is a reactant, and the unbalanced equation is
 
CH4 + O2 ¡ CO2 + H2O 1unbalanced2 
[3.2] 
It is usually best to balance first those elements that occur in the fewest chemical 
formulas in the equation. In our example, C appears in only one reactant 1CH42 and one 
product 1CO22. The same is true for H 1CH4 and H2O2. Notice, however, that O appears 
in one reactant 1O22 and two products 1CO2 and H2O2. So, let’s begin with C. Because 
one molecule of CH4 contains t
