y, refers to a transfer of energy from one object
to another because of a difference in temperature.
Notice that the direction of heat flow between two objects depends on their
temperatures, not on how much internal energy each has. Thus, if 50 g of water at
30°C is placed in contact (or mixed) with 200 g of water at 25°C, heat flows from
the water at 30°C to the water at 25°C even though the internal energy of the 25°C
water is much greater because there is so much more of it.
Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas
Let us calculate the internal energy of n moles of an ideal monatomic (one atom
per molecule) gas. The internal energy, U, is the sum of the translational kinetic
energies of all the atoms. This sum is equal to the average kinetic energy per mol-
ecule times the total number of molecules, N:
Using Eq. 13–8,
we can write this as
or (recall Section 13–8)
(14;1)
where n is the number of moles. Thus, the internal energy of an ideal gas depends
only on temperature and the number of mol
