FIGURE 11–23 A wave pulse is 
generated by a hand holding the end
of a cord and moving up and down
once. Motion of the wave pulse is to
the right. Arrows indicate velocity of
cord particles.
Waves carry energy from one place to another. Energy is given to a water wave,
for example, by a rock thrown into the water, or by wind far out at sea. The energy is
transported by waves to the shore. The oscillating hand in Fig. 11–22 transfers
energy to the rope, and that energy is transported down the rope and can be trans-
ferred to an object at the other end. All forms of traveling waves transport energy.
EXERCISE G Return to Chapter-Opening Question 2, page 292, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.
Let us look more closely at how a wave is formed and
