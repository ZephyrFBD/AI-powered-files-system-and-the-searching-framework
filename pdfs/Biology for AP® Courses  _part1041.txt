Think About It
The same second messengers are used in many different cells, but the response to second messengers is
different in each cell. How is this possible?
9.3 | Response to the Signal
In this section you will explore the following questions:
•
How do signaling pathways direct protein expression, cellular metabolism, and cell growth?
•
What is the role of apoptosis in the development and maintenance of a healthy organism?
Connection for AP® Courses
The initiation of a signaling pathway results in a cellular response to changes in the external environment. This response
can take many different forms, including protein synthesis, a change in cell metabolism, cell division and growth, or even
cell death. As we will explore in more detail in later chapters, some pathways activate enzymes that interact within DNA
transcription factors to promote gene expression, others can cause cells to store energy as glycogen as fat, or result in free
energy availability in the form of glucose.
