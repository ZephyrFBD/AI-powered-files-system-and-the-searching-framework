 their size and density. For immobile
organisms such as plants, or for very small and slow-moving organisms, a quadrat may be used (Figure 36.3). A quadrat
is a way of marking off square areas within a habitat, either by staking out an area with sticks and string, or by the use
of a wood, plastic, or metal square placed on the ground. After setting the quadrats, researchers then count the number
of individuals that lie within their boundaries. Multiple quadrat samples are performed throughout the habitat at several
random locations. All of this data can then be used to estimate the population size and population density within the entire
habitat. The number and size of quadrat samples depends on the type of organisms under study and other factors, including
the density of the organism. For example, if sampling daffodils, a 1 m2 quadrat might be used whereas with giant redwoods,
which are larger and live much further apart from each other, a larger quadrat of 100 m2 might be employed. T
