The law of conservation of momentum is particularly useful when we are
dealing with fairly simple systems such as colliding objects and certain types of
“explosions.” For example, rocket propulsion, which we saw in Chapter 4 can be
understood on the basis of action and reaction, can also be explained on the 
basis of the conservation of momentum. We can consider the rocket plus its fuel as an
isolated system if it is far out in space (no external forces). In the reference frame
of the rocket before any fuel is ejected, the total momentum of rocket plus fuel 
is zero. When the fuel burns, the total momentum remains unchanged: the back-
ward momentum of the expelled gases is just balanced by the forward
