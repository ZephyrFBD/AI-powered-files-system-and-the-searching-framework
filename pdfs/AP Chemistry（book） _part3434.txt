The unstable and highly reactive OH molecule is a free radical, a substance with 
one or more unpaired electrons, as seen in the Lewis structure shown in the margin. The 
OH molecule is also called the hydroxyl radical, and the presence of the unpaired electron 
is often emphasized by writing the species with a single dot, # OH. In cells and tissues, 
hydroxyl radicals can attack biomolecules to produce new free radicals, which in turn 
attack yet other biomolecules. Thus, the formation of a single hydroxyl radical via Equa-
tion 21.31 can initiate a large number of chemical reactions that are ultimately able to 
disrupt the normal operations of cells.
The damage produced by radiation depends on the activity and energy of the radi-
ation, the length of exposure, and whether the source is inside or outside the body. 
Gamma rays are particularly harmful outside the body because they penetrate human 
tissue very effectively, just as X rays do. Consequently, their damage is not limited to
