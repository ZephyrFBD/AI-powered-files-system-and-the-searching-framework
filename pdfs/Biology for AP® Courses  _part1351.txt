In pea plants, purple flowers (P) are dominant to white flowers (p) and yellow peas (Y) are dominant to green peas
(y). What are the possible genotypes and phenotypes for a cross between PpYY and ppYy pea plants? What is the
minimum number of squares that you need to do a Punnett square analysis of this cross?
a.
ppYY, Ppyy, ppYY, ppyy yielding white flowers with yellow peas, purple flowers with yellow peas, and
white flowers with green peas. You can find this with a 3×3 Punnett square.
b.
PPYY, PpYy, ppYY, ppyy yielding purple flowers with yellow peas, white flowers with yellow peas, and
white flowers with green peas. You can find this with a 2×2 Punnett square.
c.
Ppyy, PpYy, ppYY, ppyy yielding purple flowers with green peas, purple flowers with yellow peas, white
flowers with yellow peas, and white flowers with green peas. You can find this with a 3×3 Punnett square.
d.
PpYY, PpYy, ppYY, ppYy yielding purple flowers with yellow peas, and white flowers
