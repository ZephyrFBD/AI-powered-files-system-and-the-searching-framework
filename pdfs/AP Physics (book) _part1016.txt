 same answer as in Example 9–6 if you solve
the problem as in part (b). (d) In general, do you see any
patterns in Sections 9–2 and 9–3 for choosing the axis of
rotation to solve Problems in this Chapter?
5. Consider a ladder with a painter climbing up it (Fig. 9–94).
The mass of the uniform ladder
is 12.0 kg, and the mass of the
painter is 55.0 kg. If the ladder
begins to slip at its base when
the painter’s feet are 70%
of the way up the length of
the ladder, what is the coef-
ficient 
of 
static 
friction
between the ladder and the
floor? Assume the wall is
frictionless.
