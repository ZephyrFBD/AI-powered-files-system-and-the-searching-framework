Newton’s three laws of motion are the basic classical laws
describing motion.
Newton’s first law (the law of inertia) states that if the net
force on an object is zero, an object originally at rest remains 
at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion in a straight
line with constant velocity.
Newton’s second law states that the acceleration of an
object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it, and
inversely proportional to its mass:

Newton’s second law is one of the most important and funda-
mental laws in classical physics.
Newton’s third law states that whenever one object exerts
a force on a second object, the second
