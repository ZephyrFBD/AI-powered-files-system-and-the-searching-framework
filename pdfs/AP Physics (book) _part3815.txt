n; this
equation is true, however, only when 
Determining what value (or 
values) the unknown can have to satisfy the equation is called solving the
equation. To solve an equation, the following rule can be used:
An equation will remain true if any operation performed on one side is also
performed on the other side. For example: (a) addition or subtraction of a
number or symbol; (b) multiplication or division by a number or symbol;
(c) raising each side of the equation to the same power, or taking the same
root (such as square root).
Solve for x in the equation
APPROACH We perform the same operations on both sides of the equation 
to isolate x as the only variable on the left side of the equals sign.
SOLUTION We first subtract 7 from both sides:
or
Then we divide both sides by 2 to get
or, carrying out the divisions,
and this solves the equation.
(a) Solve the equation
for the unknown a in terms of b and c. (b) Solve for a assuming that
and
APPROACH We perform operations to isolate a a
