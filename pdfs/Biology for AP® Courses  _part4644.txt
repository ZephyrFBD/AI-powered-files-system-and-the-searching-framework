ng the number of organisms or biomass may be inverted, upright, or even diamond-shaped. Which
type of pyramid is always upright and why?
a.
Pyramid of biomass, as biomass will always be found at the base and there is loss and not gain of biomass
through the trophic levels.
b.
Pyramid of number, as the numbers of producers is always more than the number of consumers in every
ecosystem.
c.
Pyramid of energy, as energy will always be found at the base and there is loss and not gain of energy through
the trophic levels.
d.
Pyramid of predators, as predators are always fewer in an ecosystem than the producers for the ecosystem to
work efficiently.
Consequences of Food Webs: Biological Magnification
One of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification. Biomagnification is
the increasing concentration of persistent, toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level, from the primary producers
to the apex consumers. Many substances have been shown to
