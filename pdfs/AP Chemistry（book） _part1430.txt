 hybridization at each C atom is sp2, there is one p orbital on each C atom, 
each oriented perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. The situation is very much 
like that in ethylene except we now have six p orbitals arranged in a ring [Figure 9.25(b)]. 
 
The remaining six valence electrons occupy these six p orbitals, one per orbital.
We could envision using the p orbitals to form three localized p bonds. As shown 
in Figure 9.26, there are two equivalent ways to make these localized bonds, each corre-
sponding to one resonance structure. However, a representation that reflects both reso-
nance structures has the six p electrons “smeared out” among all six carbon atoms, as 
shown on the right in Figure 9.26. Notice how this smeared representation corresponds
