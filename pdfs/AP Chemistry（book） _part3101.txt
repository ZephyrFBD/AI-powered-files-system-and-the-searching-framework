gases are 
formed from either solids or liquids, or the number of molecules of 
gas increases during a chemical reaction. The third law of thermody-
namics states that the entropy of a pure crystalline solid at 0 K is zero.
ENTROPY CHANGES IN CHEMICAL REACTIONS (SECTION 19.4)  
The third law allows us to assign entropy values for substances at 
different temperatures. Under standard conditions, the entropy of 
a mole of a substance is called its standard molar entropy, denoted S°. 
From tabulated values of S°, we can calculate the entropy change for 
any process under standard conditions. For an isothermal process, 
the entropy change in the surroundings is equal to - ∆H>T.
GIBBS FREE ENERGY (SECTION 19.5) The Gibbs free energy (or 
just free energy), G, is a thermodynamic state function that com-
bines the two state functions enthalpy and entropy: G = H - TS. 
For processes that occur at constant temperature, ∆G = ∆H - T∆S. 
For a process occurring at constant temperature and pressure
