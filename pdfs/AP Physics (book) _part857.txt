tron stars. A neutron star is believed
to form from the inner core of a larger star that collapsed, under its own gravi-
tation, to a star of very small radius and very high density. Before collapse,
suppose the core of such a star is the size of our Sun
with mass
2.0 times as great as the Sun, and is rotating at a frequency of 1.0 revolution every
100 days. If it were to undergo gravitational collapse to a neutron star of radius
10 km, what would its rotation frequency be? Assume the star is a uniform sphere
at all times, and loses no mass.
APPROACH We assume the star is isolated (no external forces), so we can use
conservation of angular momentum for this process.
SOLUTION From conservation of angular momentum, Eq. 8–20,
where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to initial (normal star) and final (neutron star),
respectively. Then, assuming no mass is lost in the process (
),
The frequency

which is 600 Hz or (600 revs)(60 smin) = 36,000 rpm.
