oup 8A are chemically unreactive. Indeed, most of our references to 
these elements have been in relation to their physical properties, as when we discussed 
intermolecular forces.  
 (Section 11.2) The relative inertness of these elements is due 
to the presence of a completed octet of valence-shell electrons (except He, which only 
has a filled 1s shell). The stability of such an arrangement is reflected in the high ioniza-
tion energies of the group 8A elements. 
 (Section 7.4)
The group 8A elements are all gases at room temperature. They are components of 
Earth’s atmosphere, except for radon, which exists only as a short-lived radioisotope. 
 
 (Section 21.9) Only argon is relatively abundant.
