e first MO, which is shown at the bottom 
right of Figure 9.31, is formed by adding the wave functions for the two 1s orbitals. We refer 
to this as constructive combination. The energy of the resulting MO is lower in energy than the 
two atomic orbitals from which it was made. It is called the bonding molecular orbital.
The second MO is formed by what is called destructive combination: combining the 
two atomic orbitals in a way that causes the electron density to be canceled in the central 
region where the two overlap. The process is discussed more fully in the “Closer Look” 
box later in the chapter. The energy of the resulting MO, referred to as the antibonding 
molecular orbital, is higher than the energy of the atomic orbitals. The antibonding 
MO of H2 is shown at the top right in Figure 9.31.
As illustrated in Figure 9.31, in the bonding MO electron density is concentrated 
in the region between the two nuclei. This sausage-shaped MO results from summing
