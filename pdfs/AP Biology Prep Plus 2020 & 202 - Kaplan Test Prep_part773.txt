aging behavior in response to the constantly changing environment
allows honeybees to minimize energetic cost and maximize food
acquisition.
Competition and
Cooperation
Innate and learned behaviors may be cooperative and/or competitive.
Cooperation is the process of acting together for common benefits,
whereas competition is the process of striving for limited resources. Both
cooperation and competition aﬀect survival and occur at various levels of
organization: cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms,
populations, communities, and ecosystems.
On the cellular level, cooperation and competition increase the eﬀiciency
of using matter and energy. Chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes are
aﬀected by the cooperation between enzymes and their substrates, as
well as by the competition between inhibitors and substrates. Examples
of cooperation between organs and organ systems include the
coordination of roots and shoots of plants and of the digestive and
excretory systems of animals
