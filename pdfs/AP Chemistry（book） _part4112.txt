18.55 The fewer steps in a process, the less waste is generated. Pro-
cesses with fewer steps require less energy at the site of the process 
and for subsequent cleanup or disposal of waste. 18.57 (a) H2O  
(b) It is better to prevent waste than to treat it. Atom economy. Less haz-
ardous chemical synthesis and inherently safer for accident preven-
tion. Catalysis and design for energy efficiency. Raw materials should 
be renewable. 18.59 (a) Water as a solvent, by criteria 5, 7, and 12.
