Alternatives to Dominance and Recessiveness
Mendel’s experiments with pea plants suggested that: (1) two “units” or alleles exist for every gene; (2) alleles maintain
their integrity in each generation (no blending); and (3) in the presence of the dominant allele, the recessive allele is hidden
and makes no contribution to the phenotype. Therefore, recessive alleles can be “carried” and not expressed by individuals.
Such heterozygous individuals are sometimes referred to as “carriers.” Further genetic studies in other plants and animals
have shown that much more complexity exists, but that the fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics still hold true. In
