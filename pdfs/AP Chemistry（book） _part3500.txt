2O are 
3.81 °C and 101.42 °C, respectively, versus 0.00 °C and 100.00 °C for H2O. Not surpris-
ingly, the density of D2O at 25 °C 11.104 g>mL2 is greater than that of H2O 10.997 g>mL2. 
Replacing protium with deuterium (a process called deuteration) can also have a profound 
effect on reaction rates, a phenomenon called a kinetic-isotope effect. For example, heavy 
water can be obtained from the electrolysis 32 H2O1l2 ¡ 2 H21g2 + O21g24 of ordinary 
water because the small amount of naturally occurring D2O in the sample undergoes elec-
trolysis more slowly than H2O and, therefore, becomes concentrated during the reaction.
The third isotope, 3
1H, tritium, is radioactive, with a half-life of 12.3 yr:

Because of its short half-life, only trace quantities of tritium exist naturally. The isotope 
can be synthesized in nuclear reactors by neutron bombardment of lithium-6:
