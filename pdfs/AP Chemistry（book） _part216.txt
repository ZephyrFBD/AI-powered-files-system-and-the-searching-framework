ensional anal-
ysis approach to problem solving, we keep track of units as we carry 
measurements through calculations. The units are multiplied to-
gether, divided into each other, or canceled like algebraic quantities. 
Obtaining the proper units for the final result is an important means 
of checking the method of calculation. When converting units and 
when carrying out several other types of problems, conversion factors 
can be used. These factors are ratios constructed from valid relations 
between equivalent quantities.
