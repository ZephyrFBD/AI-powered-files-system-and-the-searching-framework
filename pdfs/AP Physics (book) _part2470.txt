It is possible to move
atoms and molecules around by steering them with a laser beam, in a device
called optical tweezers. Optical tweezers have some remarkable applications.
They are of great interest to biologists, especially since optical tweezers can manip-
ulate live microorganisms, and components within a cell, without damaging them.
Optical tweezers have been used to measure the elastic properties of DNA by
pulling each end of the molecule with such a laser “tweezers.”

Electromagnetic waves offer the possibility of transmitting information over long
distances. Among the first to realize this and put it into practice was Guglielmo
Marconi (1874–1937) w
