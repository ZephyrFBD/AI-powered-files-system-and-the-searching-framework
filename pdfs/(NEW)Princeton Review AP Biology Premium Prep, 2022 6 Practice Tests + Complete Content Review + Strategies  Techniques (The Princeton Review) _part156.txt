What happens when two monosaccharides are brought together? The hydrogen (–H) from one sugar molecule
combines with the hydroxyl group (–OH) of another sugar molecule. What do H and OH add up to? Water (H2O)!
The process illustrated above is called dehydration synthesis, or condensation, because during this process, a
water molecule is lost. When two monosaccharides are joined, the bond is called a glycosidic linkage, and the
resulting sugar is called a disaccharide. The disaccharide formed from two glucose molecules is maltose. Other
common disaccharides include sucrose (table sugar) and lactose (found in dairy products).
Break Down the Words
Dehydration = removal
of water
Synthesis = Creation
Hydro = water
Lysis = breakdown
Now, what if you want to break up the disaccharide and form two monosaccharides again? Just add water. That’s
called hydrolysis, which means “water” (hydro-) and “breaking” (-lysis). The water breaks the bond between the
two monomers. Like condensation, hydrol
