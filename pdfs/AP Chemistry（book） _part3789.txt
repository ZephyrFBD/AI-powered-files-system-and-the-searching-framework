ogen ligands are 
unaffected. (d) The pKa of 3Zn(H2O)642+ is 10. Suggest an 
explanation for the difference between this pKa and that 
of carbonic anhydrase. (e) Would you expect carbonic 
anhydrase to have a deep color, like hemoglobin and other 
metal-ion-containing proteins do? Explain.
 23.93  Two different compounds have the formulation 
CoBr(SO4) # 5 NH3. Compound A is dark violet, and com-
pound B is red-violet. When compound A is treated with 
AgNO3(aq), no reaction occurs, whereas compound B 
reacts with AgNO3(aq) to form a white precipitate. When 
compound A is treated with BaCl2(aq), a white precipi-
tate is formed, whereas compound B has no reaction with 
BaCl2(aq). (a) Is Co in the same oxidation state in these 
complexes? (b) Explain the reactivity of compounds A and 
B with AgNO3(aq) and BaCl2(aq). (c) Are compounds A and 
B isomers of one another? If so, which category from Figure 
23.19 best describes the isomerism observed for these com-
plexes? (d) Would compounds A
