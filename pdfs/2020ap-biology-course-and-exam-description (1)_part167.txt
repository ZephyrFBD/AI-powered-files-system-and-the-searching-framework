difference between a gene and an allele. 
Gene expression occurs at many levels, all of 
which are crucial in producing an organism’s 
phenotype. Students can use the lac operon 
in E. coli to help them understand the 
significance of positive gene regulation. 
Often on the exam, students fail to provide 
reasoning connecting a change on the 
molecular level (e.g., a mutation) to a change 
in phenotype (e.g., an increase or decrease in 
protein levels). Students should understand 
that the location of a mutation in the codon 
can affect the structure and function of a 
protein. Common errors include stating 
that mutations result in the denaturation 
of a protein or that point mutations cause 
frameshift mutations. Students also tend to 
describe all mutations as having negative 
effects; exposure to examples of mutations 
that have no impact on phenotype can help 
prevent this misunderstanding.
