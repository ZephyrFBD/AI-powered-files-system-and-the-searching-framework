 the
whole Earth receives energy from the Sun. (b) Assume the
Earth radiates an equal amount back into space (that is,
the Earth is in equilibrium). Then, assuming the Earth is a
perfect emitter 
estimate its average surface
temperature. [Hint: Discuss why you use area
or
in each part.]

100 grams of (a) ice at 
, (b) ice at 0°C, (c) water at
10°C, (d) water at 100°C, and (e) steam at 110°C.

4. A house has well-insulated walls 19.5 cm thick (assume
conductivity of air) and area 
a roof of wood 5.5 cm
thick and area 
and uncovered windows 0.65 cm
thick and total area 
(a) Assuming that heat is lost
only by conduction, calculate the rate at which heat must
be supplied to this house to maintain its inside tempera-
ture at 23°C if the outside temperature is
(b) If 
the house is initially at 15°C, estimate how much heat 
must be supplied to raise the temperature to 23°C within
30 min. Assume t
