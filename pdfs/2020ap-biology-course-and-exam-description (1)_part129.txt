Students build on their abilities to describe 
and explain biological concepts and 
processes by describing the cell cycle 
regulation. Students should now be able to 
explain the relationships between structure 
and function for all organelles and cellular 
components on both the subcellular and the 
cellular level.
By performing laboratory investigations 
focused on the concepts of cell cycle, 
students should develop an understanding 
of how to formulate and devise a plan 
to investigate the answer to a scientific 
question—critical skills for scientific 
inquiry. Students continue to build skills 
in communicating the results of scientific 
inquiry. This is a unit where students can 
be given opportunities to practice their 
graphing skills.
