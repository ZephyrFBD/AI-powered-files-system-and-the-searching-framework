Grid-In Questions
1. Answer: 22
Since adenine pairs with thymine, adenine equals thymine in their numbers. Since cytosine pairs with guanine,
cytosine equals guanine in their numbers. If adenine = thymine = 28%, and adenine + thymine = 56%, then cytosine
+ guanine must equal 44% and cytosine = guanine = 44 รท 2 = 22%. Also uracil = 0% because there is no uracil in
DNA (only in RNA).
2. Answer: 0.33
 
Using N and n to represent the normal and mutant alleles, respectively, the only living individual who can possess
the allele is a female who is
XNXn . A fetus who is XnXn or XnY does not survive to birth. The genotype of the father must be XNY. Thus, the
cross is XNXn ร
XNY, and the offspring are
 
. Only the XNXn
individual has one copy of the allele.
