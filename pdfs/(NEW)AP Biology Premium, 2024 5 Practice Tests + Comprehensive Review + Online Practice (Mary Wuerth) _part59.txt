he means for those data sets will likely be
different. Therefore, choices (C) and (D) are incorrect.
3. (D) The chi-square test is most appropriately used on raw data, such as the numbers of individuals in each
category. The values used in the chi-square table have been calculated by statisticians and are designed to be
used with raw data. Processed data, such as means and percentages, cannot be used with the chi-square test,
making choices (A), (B), and (C) incorrect.
4. (C) Since there are four different phenotypes that could be produced, there are 3 degrees of freedom. Degrees
of freedom = number of possible outcomes in the experiment – 1 = 4 – 1 = 3.
5. (D)
. Using the observed and expected values in the problem:
. There are two possible outcomes in the experiment (tall or dwarf), so
the degrees of freedom = 2 – 1 = 1. Using the p-value of 0.05 and the chi-square table, the critical value is 3.84.
The calculated chi-square value from the data is less than the critical value, so the
