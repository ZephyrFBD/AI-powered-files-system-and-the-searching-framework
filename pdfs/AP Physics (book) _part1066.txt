 no
obstacles that interrupt the flow. The fluid pressure is exerted on the walls of a
tube or pipe, or on the surface of a material the fluid passes over.
Bernoulli developed an equation that expresses this principle quantitatively.
To derive Bernoulli’s equation, we assume the flow is steady and laminar, the
fluid is incompressible, and the viscosity is small enough to be ignored. To be
general, we assume the fluid is flowing in a tube of nonuniform cross section that
varies in height above some reference level, Fig. 10–22. We will consider the
volume of fluid shown in color and calculate the work done to move it from the
position shown in Fig. 10–22a to that shown in Fig. 10–22b. In this process, fluid
entering area 
flows a distance 
and forces the fluid at area 
to move a
distance 
The fluid to the left of area 
exerts a pressure 
on our section 
of fluid and does an amount of work
(since
). At point 2, the work done on our section of fluid is
The negative sign is present because
