) No, the χ2 value is smaller than 3.84.
7. A mating is set up between two pure breeding strains of plants. One parent has long leaves and long shoots.
The other parent has short leaves and stubby shoots. F1 plants are collected, and all have long leaves and long
shoots. F1 plants are self-crossed, and 1,000 F2 plants are phenotyped. The data is as follows:
Phenotype
# of F2

Short leaves, long shoots
​ ​ ​ 112
Short leaves, stubby shoots

Are the genes for leaf and shoot length segregating independently?
(A) Yes; the degrees of freedom are 3, and the calculated χ2 value is small.
(B) No; the degrees of freedom are 3, and the calculated χ2 value is large.
(C) Yes; the degree of freedom is 1, and the calculated χ2 value is small.
(D) No; the degree of freedom is 1, and the calculated χ2 value is large.
