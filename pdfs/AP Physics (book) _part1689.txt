ginal volume. Draw the process on a
PV diagram.
3. (II) Sketch a PV diagram of the following process: 2.5 L of
ideal gas at atmospheric pressure is cooled at constant
pressure to a volume of 1.0 L, and then expanded isother-
mally back to 2.5 L, whereupon the pressure is increased at
constant volume until the original pressure is reached.
4. (II) A gas is enclosed in a cylinder fitted with a light 
frictionless piston and maintained at atmospheric pressure.
When 254 kcal of heat is added to the gas, the volume 
is observed to increase slowly from 
to 
Calculate (a) the work done by the gas and (b) the change
in internal energy of the gas.
5. (II) A 1.0-L volume of air initially at 3.5 atm of (gauge)
pressure is allowed to expand isothermally until the pressure
is 1.0 atm. It is then compressed at constant pressure to its
initial volume, and lastly is brought back to its original
pressure by heating at constant volume. Draw the process
on a PV diagram, including numbers and labels for t
