up of
populations can be measured over time. Eliminate (A), as genetic changes occur only at the individual
level. Only under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium does the gene pool remain fixed over time in a population.
However, this statement does not explain why the population is the evolving unit, so (B) is incorrect.
Choice (C) is true but does not address the question.

A
Positive feedback occurs when a stimulus causes an increased response. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are
examples of negative feedback.

B
In order to determine the genotype of the parents, use the ratio of the offspring given in the question and
work backward. The ratio of black-haired to white-haired guinea pigs is 3:1. In order to get a white-haired
offspring, each parent must have been able to contribute a b allele. However, since the parents were both
black in color, they must have each been Bb.

D
The mean weight of the offspring in the next generation will be heavier than the mean weight of the
original populat
