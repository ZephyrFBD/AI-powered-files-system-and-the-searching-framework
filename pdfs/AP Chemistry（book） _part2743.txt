of H3PO3 is equal to that of H2PO3
-, and at that point, pH = pKa1. Similar logic is true for 
the second equilibrium reaction: halfway toward its equivalence point, pH = pKa2.
We can then just look at titration data and estimate the pKas for the polyprotic acid 
directly from the titration curve. This procedure is especially useful if you are trying to identify 
an unknown polyprotic acid. In Figure 17.15, for instance, the first equivalence point occurs 
for 50 mL NaOH added. Halfway to the equivalence point corresponds to 25 mL NaOH. 
Because the pH at 25 mL NaOH is about 1.5 we may estimate pKa1 = 1.5 for phosphorous 
acid. The second equivalence point occurs at 100 mL NaOH added; halfway there (from the 
first equivalence point) is at 75 mL NaOH added. The graph indicates the pH at 75 mL NaOH 
added is about 6.5, and we therefore estimate that pKa2 for phosphorous acid is 6.5. The actual 
values for the two pKas are pKa1 = 1.3 and pKa2 = 6.7 (close to
