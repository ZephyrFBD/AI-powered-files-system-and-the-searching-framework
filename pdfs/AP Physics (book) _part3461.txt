makes up only 0.7% of natural uranium, the yearly require-
ment for uranium is on the order of a hundred tons. This is orders of magnitude
less than coal, both in mass and volume. Coal releases

For natural uranium, the figure is 100 times less,
EXERCISE C A nuclear-powered submarine needs 6000-kW input power. How many
fissions is this per second?
Atom Bomb
The first use of fission, however, was not to produce electric power. Instead, it
was first used as a fission bomb (called the “atomic bomb”). In early 1940, with
Europe already at war, Germany’s leader, Adolf Hitler, banned the sale of
uranium from the Czech mines he had recently taken over. Research into the
fission process suddenly was enshrouded in secrecy. Physicists in the United
States were alarmed. A group of them approached Einstein—a man whose name
was a household word—to send a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt about
the possibilities of using nuclear fissi
