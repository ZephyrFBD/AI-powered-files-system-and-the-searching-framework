 that you are rolling a six-
sided die (D) and flipping a penny (P) at the same time. The die may roll any number from 1â€“6 (D#), whereas the penny
may turn up heads (PH) or tails (PT). The outcome of rolling the die has no effect on the outcome of flipping the penny
and vice versa. There are 12 possible outcomes of this action (Table 12.2), and each event is expected to occur with equal
probability.

Of the 12 possible outcomes, the die has a 2/12 (or 1/6) probability of rolling a two, and the penny has a 6/12 (or 1/2)
probability of coming up heads. By the product rule, the probability that you will obtain the combined outcome 2 and heads
is: (D2) x (PH)
