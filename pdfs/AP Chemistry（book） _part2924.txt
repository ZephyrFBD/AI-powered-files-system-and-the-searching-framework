, but there is hope that its cost 
can be greatly reduced.
Water disinfection is one of the greatest public health innovations in human his-
tory. It has dramatically decreased the incidences of waterborne bacterial diseases 
such as cholera and typhus. However, this great benefit comes at a price. In 1974 sci-
entists in Europe and the United States discovered that chlorination of water pro-
duces a group of by-products previously undetected. These by-products are called 
trihalomethanes (THMs) because all have a single carbon atom and three halogen 
atoms: CHCl3, CHCl2Br, CHClBr2, and CHBr3. These and many other chlorine- and 
bromine-containing organic substances are produced by the reaction of dissolved chlo-
rine with the organic materials present in nearly all natural waters, as well as with sub-
stances that are by-products of human activity. Recall that chlorine dissolves in water to 
form the oxidizing agent HClO as shown in Equation 18.15.
