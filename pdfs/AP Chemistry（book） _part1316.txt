, which is the charge that 
the atom would have if all atoms had the same electronegativity. In 
general, the dominant Lewis structure will have low formal charges, 
with any negative formal charges residing on more electronegative 
atoms.
Sometimes a single dominant Lewis structure is inadequate to 
represent a particular molecule (or ion). In such situations, we de-
scribe the molecule by using two or more resonance structures for the 
molecule. The molecule is envisioned as a blend of these multiple 
resonance structures. Resonance structures are important in describ-
ing the bonding in molecules such as ozone, O3, and the organic 
molecule benzene, C6H6.
EXCEPTIONS TO THE OCTET RULE (SECTION 8.7) The octet rule 
is not obeyed in all cases. Exceptions occur when (a) a molecule has 
an odd number of electrons, (b) it is not possible to complete an oc-
tet around an atom without forcing an unfavorable distribution of 
electrons, or (c) a large atom is surrounded by a sufficiently larg
