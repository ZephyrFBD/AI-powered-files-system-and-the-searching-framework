▲ Figure 2.25 Procedure for naming acids. Here acids containing chlorine are used as  
an example. Prefixes used for oxyanions, such as, per- and hypo-, are retained in the acids  
derived from those anions.

The following examples illustrate these rules:
Cl2O
dichlorine monoxide
NF3
nitrogen trifluoride
N2O4
dinitrogen tetroxide
P4S10
tetraphosphorus decasulfide
Rule 4 is necessary because we cannot predict formulas for most molecular sub-
stances the way we can for ionic compounds. Molecular compounds that contain hydro-
gen and one other element are an important exception, however. These compounds can 
be treated as if they were neutral substances containing H+ ions and anions. Thus, you 
can predict that the substance named hydrogen chloride has the formula HCl, contain-
ing one H+ to bal
