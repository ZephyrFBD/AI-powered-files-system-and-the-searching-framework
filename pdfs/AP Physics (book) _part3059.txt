he higher states,
and so on, are called excited states. The
fixed energy levels are also called stationary states.
Notice that although the energy for the larger orbits has a smaller numerical
value, all the energies are less than zero. Thus,
is a higher energy than
Hence the orbit closest to the nucleus 
has the lowest energy (the
most negative). The reason the energies have negative values has to do with the way
we defined the zero for potential energy. For two point charges,
corresponds to zero potential energy when the two charges are infinitely far apart
(Section 17–5). Thus, an electron that can just barely be free from the atom by
reaching
(or, at least, far from the nucleus) with zero kinetic energy will
have
corresponding to 
in Eqs. 27–15. If an
electron is free and has kinetic energy, then
To remove an electron that is
part of an atom requires an energy input (otherwise atoms would not be stable).
Since 
for a free electron, then an electron bound to an atom needs to have
