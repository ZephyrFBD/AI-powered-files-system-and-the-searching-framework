een two points a and b
where a uniform electric field E exists is given by

where d is the distance between the two points.
An equipotential line or surface is all at the same poten-
tial, and is perpendicular to the electric field at all points.
The electric potential at a position P due to a single point
charge Q, relative to zero potential at infinity, is given by

Summary
17–12 Electrocardiogram
(ECG or EKG)
Each time the heart beats, changes in electrical potential occur on its surface that
can be detected using electrodes (metal contacts), which are attached to the 
skin. The changes in potential are small, on the order of millivolts (mV), and must
be amplified. They are displayed with a chart recorder on paper, or on a monitor
(CRT or LCD), Fig. 17–36. An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is the record of
the potential changes for a given person’s heart. An example is shown in Fi
