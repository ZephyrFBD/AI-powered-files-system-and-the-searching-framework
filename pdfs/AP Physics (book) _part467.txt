 a circular path: the net force is directed toward the circle’s center. The
force must be applied by other objects. For example, to swing a ball in a circle on
the end of a string, you pull on the string and the string exerts the force on the
ball. (Try it.) Here, the “centripetal force” that provides the centripetal accelera-
tion is tension in the string. In other cases it can be gravity (on the Moon, for example),
a normal force, or even an electric force.
