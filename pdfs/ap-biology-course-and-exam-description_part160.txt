Environmental Effects
on Phenotype
SUGGESTED SKILL
Concept Explanation
1.C
Explain biological concepts, 
processes, and/or models 
in applied contexts.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
SYI-3.B
Explain how the same 
genotype can result in 
multiple phenotypes under 
different environmental 
conditions.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SYI-3.B.1
Environmental factors influence gene 
expression and can lead to phenotypic 
plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity occurs when 
individuals with the same genotype exhibit 
different phenotypes in different environments.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
SYI-3
Naturally occurring diversity among and between components within biological 
systems affects interactions with the environment.
