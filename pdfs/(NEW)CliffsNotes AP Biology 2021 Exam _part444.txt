an early reptile. Insect wings, therefore, are analogous structures.
9. A. A bottleneck occurs when population size precipitously falls. Surviving individuals may possess only a limited
amount of the total genetic variation present previously. In addition, the effect of genetic drift intensifies when
populations are small.
10. D. A consequence of sexual reproduction is that crossing over during prophase I of meiosis, mixing of maternal
and paternal chromosomes, and random union of gametes produce new combinations of alleles in every generation.
Except for identical twins, no two individuals will ever have exactly the same genetic makeup.
11. C. As a result of genetic variation, there will be some bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. Extensive use of
antibiotics kills bacteria that are susceptible, but resistant variants survive and reproduce. After many generations of
(directional) selection for resistant bacteria, most surviving bacteria are antibiotic resistant.
12. B. The var
