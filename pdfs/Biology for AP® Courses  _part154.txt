ith one
electron in each energy level before a second electron is added. The electrons of the outermost energy level determine the
energetic stability of the atom and its tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms to form molecules.
Under standard conditions, atoms fill the inner shells first, often resulting in a variable number of electrons in the outermost
shell. The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of
eight electrons. This is known as the octet rule, which states, with the exception of the innermost shell, that atoms are
more stable energetically when they have eight electrons in their valence shell, the outermost electron shell. Examples of
some neutral atoms and their electron configurations are shown in this figure. Notice that in this Figure 2.7, helium has
a complete outer electron shell, with two electrons filling its first and only shell. Similarly, neon has a complete outer 2n
shell containing eigh
