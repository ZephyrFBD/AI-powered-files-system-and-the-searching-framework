 based on conservation 
of energy and states that the algebraic sum of the changes in
potential around any closed path of the circuit must be zero.
When capacitors are connected in parallel, the equivalent
capacitance is the sum of the individual capacitances:

Summary
When capacitors are connected in series, it is the recipro-
cals that add up:
(19;6)
When an RC circuit containing a resistance R in series with
a capacitance C is connected to a dc source of emf, the voltage
across the capacitor rises gradually in time characterized by an
exponential of the form 
, where the time constant
(19;7)
is the time it takes for the voltage to reach 63% of its maximum
value.
A capacitor discharging through a resistor is characterized
by the same time constant: in a time 
the voltage across
the capacitor drops to 37% of its initial value. The charge on
the capacitor, and the voltage across it, decrease as 
.
