Then we have the situation shown in Fig. 29–26b, with a few arsenic atoms holding 
positions in the crystal lattice where normally silicon atoms are. Only four of arsenic’s
electrons fit into the bonding structure. The fifth does not fit in and can move
relatively freely, somewhat like the electrons in a conductor. Because of this small
number of extra electrons, a doped semiconductor becomes slightly conducting.
The density of conduction electrons in an intrinsic
semiconductor at
room temperature is very low, usually less than 1 per 
atoms. With an impurity
concentration of 1 in 
or 
when doped, the conductivity will be much higher
and it can be controlled with great precision. An arsenic-doped silicon crystal is an 
n-type semiconductor because negative charges (electrons) carry the electric current.
