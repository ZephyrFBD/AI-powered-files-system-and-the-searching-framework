 and opposition. Synovial joints are also classified into six different
categories on the basis of the shape and structure of the joint: planar, hinge, pivot, condyloid, saddle, and ball-and-socket.
29.4 Muscle Contraction and Locomotion
The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Skeleton muscle
tissue is composed of sarcomeres, the functional units of muscle tissue. Muscle contraction occurs when sarcomeres
shorten, as thick and thin filaments slide past each other, which is called the sliding filament model of muscle contraction.
ATP provides the energy for cross-bridge formation and filament sliding. Regulatory proteins, such as troponin and
tropomyosin, control cross-bridge formation. Excitationâ€“contraction coupling transduces the electrical signal of the
neuron, via acetylcholine, to an electrical signal on the muscle membrane, which initiates force production. The number of
muscle fibers contracting determines how much forc
