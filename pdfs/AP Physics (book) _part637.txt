 to be
for the gravitational potential energy.
5. Is mechanical energy conserved? No. Friction is present.
6. Apply conservation of energy. There is friction acting on the car, so we use
conservation of energy in the form of Eq. 6–16b, with  
and 
Thus
7. Solve. We solve the above equation for 
the energy dissipated to thermal
energy:
The friction force, which acts over a distance of 400 m, averages out to be  
NOTE This result is only a rough average: the friction force at various points
depends on the normal force, which varies with slope.
