instantiation, moveclass (perturb), and cost functions.  Further, tuning of parameter values for temperature 
initialization, equilibration, etc. will likely be needed.  Documentation on these subjects is currently 
limited to the book (see section 1 of this document), the code (e.g., try help hoffmann), and by way 
of example: the six example toy applications included with the package. 
 
Happy annealing!
