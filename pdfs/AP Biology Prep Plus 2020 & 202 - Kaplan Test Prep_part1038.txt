food chain, grass is at the bottom and
has the greatest biomass, making (A) correct.
26. B
The only way a bacterium can be induced to produce a human protein such as insulin is
to have the gene that codes for the production of that protein inserted into the bacterial
genome. (B) is thus correct. (A) is clearly incorrect; bacteria are cultured on sugar-rich
media routinely, but it does not confer human abilities upon them. Both (C) and (D)
suggest technically feasible possibilities, except that the chances of such a beneficial
transfer of genetic information occurring in either case would be virtually zero.
27. D
All three of the ways mentioned in (A), (B), and (C) would decrease the rate at which
atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. While it is true that photosynthesis removes
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and that an increase in the rate of photosynthesis
would decrease the rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide increases, (A) is incorrect
because it is not the only correct me
