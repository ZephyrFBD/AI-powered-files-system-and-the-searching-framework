is process isothermal? (c) Does the change 
in the internal energy, ∆E, depend on the particular path-
way taken to carry out this change of state?
 19.18  A system goes from state 1 to state 2 and back to state 1. 
(a) Is ∆E the same in magnitude for both the forward and 
reverse processes? (b) Without further information, can 
you conclude that the amount of heat transferred to the 
system as it goes from state 1 to state 2 is the same or dif-
ferent as compared to that upon going from state 2 back to 
state 1? (c) Suppose the changes in state are reversible pro-
cesses. Is the work done by the system upon going from 
state 1 to state 2 the same or different as compared to that 
upon going from state 2 back to state 1?
 19.19  Consider a system consisting of an ice cube. (a) Under 
what conditions can the ice cube melt reversibly? (b) If 
the ice cube melts reversibly, is ∆H zero for the process?
 19.20  Consider what happens when a sample of the explosive 
TNT is detonated under atm
