the stapes is not long enough to reach the tympanum. If we did not have the malleus and the incus, then the vibrations
of the tympanum would never reach the inner ear. These bones also function to collect force and amplify sounds. The ear
ossicles are homologous to bones in a fish mouth: the bones that support gills in fish are thought to be adapted for use in the
vertebrate ear over evolutionary time. Many animals (frogs, reptiles, and birds, for example) use the stapes of the middle
ear to transmit vibrations to the middle ear.
Figure 27.13 Sound travels through the outer ear to the middle ear, which is bounded on its exterior by the tympanic
membrane. The middle ear contains three bones called ossicles that transfer the sound wave to the oval window, the
exterior boundary of the inner ear. The organ of Corti, which is the organ of sound transduction, lies inside the cochlea.
