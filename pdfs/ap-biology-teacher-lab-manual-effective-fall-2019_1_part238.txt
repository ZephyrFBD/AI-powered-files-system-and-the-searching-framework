e ratios you would get from flipping two coins at once. Don’t go on until you are sure 
the spreadsheet is making correct calculations. Try out different values for p. Make sure 
that the number of zygotes adds up. Describe your thinking and procedure for checking 
the spreadsheet in your lab notebook. 
Now, copy the cells E5 through J5 down for as many zygotes as you’d like in the first 
generation. Use the SUM function to calculate the numbers of each genotype in the H, 
I, and J columns. Use the genotype frequencies to calculate new allele frequencies and to 
recalculate new p and q values. Make a bar graph of the genotypes using the chart tool. 
Your spreadsheet should resemble Figure 8.

Testing Your Mathematical Model 
You now have a model with which you can explore how allele frequencies behave 
and change from generation to generation. Working with a partner, develop a plan to 
answer this general question: How do inheritance patterns or
