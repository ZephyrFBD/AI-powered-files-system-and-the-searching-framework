otypic results of this cross would produce ¼ TT, ½ Tt, and ¼ tt, while the phenotypic
frequencies would be ¾ tall and ¼ dwarf because both TT and Tt genotypes produce tall plants.

Complete Dominance, Dihybrid Cross
For a dihybrid cross, genes for two different traits are observed at the same time. In peas, seed color can be yellow
(Y) or green (y), and seed texture can be round (R) or wrinkled (r). Thus, Y and y are used to represent the two alleles
(yellow and green) for the gene for seed color, and R and r (round and wrinkled) are used for the alleles for seed
texture. A cross between one pea plant homozygous dominant for both traits and a second plant homozygous
recessive for both traits would be given as YYRR × yyrr. The first step in analyzing this cross is to determine the
alleles of all possible gametes. The YYRR plant can produce only one kind of gamete, YR. This is determined by the
law of segregation; that is, one allele of each allele pair migrates to opposite pol
