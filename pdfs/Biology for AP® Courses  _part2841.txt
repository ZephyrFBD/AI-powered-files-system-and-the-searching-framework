a throughout the cell’s life. The principal job of
an erythrocyte is to carry and deliver oxygen to the tissues.
Leukocytes are the predominant white blood cells found in the peripheral blood. Leukocytes are counted in the thousands in
the blood with measurements expressed as ranges: primate counts range from 4,800 to 10,800 cells per µl, dogs from 5,600
to 19,200 cells per µl, cats from 8,000 to 25,000 cells per µl, cattle from 4,000 to 12,000 cells per µl, and pigs from 11,000
to 22,000 cells per µl.
Lymphocytes function primarily in the immune response to foreign antigens or material. Different types of lymphocytes
make antibodies tailored to the foreign antigens and control the production of those antibodies. Neutrophils are phagocytic
cells and they participate in one of the early lines of defense against microbial invaders, aiding in the removal of bacteria
that has entered the body. Another leukocyte that is found in the peripheral blood is the monocyte. Monocytes give rise to
