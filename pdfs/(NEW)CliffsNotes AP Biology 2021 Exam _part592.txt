plasma membrane surface. These receptors, in turn, trigger the
production of a second messenger, for example, the conversion of ATP to cAMP, which, in turn, activates an
enzyme that produces a particular cellular function.
b. B cells have special antigen receptors on their plasma membranes. In the production of B cells, millions of
possible genetic combinations produce B cells with different kinds of receptors that will bind to different antigens.
When an antigen enters the body, it will bind only to the B cell with the specific antigen receptor. When this occurs,
B cells proliferate, producing plasma cells that have exactly the same antigen receptors. The antigen receptors are
then released into the body fluids as antibodies, which bind and inactivate the antigens that stimulated their
production.
c. When a neurotransmitter, such as acetylcholine, is secreted by the presynaptic membrane, it diffuses across the
synaptic cleft to the postsynaptic membrane. The neurotransmitter binds to
