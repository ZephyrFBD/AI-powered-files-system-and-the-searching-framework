me organs and limbs that the major arteries supply. Fluid is also
brought back to the heart via the lymphatic system.
The structure of the different types of blood vessels reflects their function or layers. There are three distinct layers, or tunics,
that form the walls of blood vessels (Figure 31.17). The first tunic is a smooth, inner lining of endothelial cells that are
in contact with the red blood cells. The endothelial tunic is continuous with the endocardium of the heart. In capillaries,
this single layer of cells is the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the endothelial cells and red
blood cells, as well as the exchange site via endocytosis and exocytosis. The movement of materials at the site of capillaries
is regulated by vasoconstriction, narrowing of the blood vessels, and vasodilation, widening of the blood vessels; this is
important in the overall regulation of blood pressure.
Veins and arteries both have two further tunics that surround the endoth
