ure never exceeds 30° Celsius. If this plant was placed outside for seven days during a
heat wave (in which the high temperature each day reached 39°C), predict the effect this would have on

Multiple-Choice
1. (C) The fox is a secondary consumer because it gets its energy from a primary consumer (the kangaroo rat).
