2 state is at a lower energy than one in the n = 1 state, 
and (c) the energy of an emitted photon equals the energy 
difference of the two states involved in the emission.
 6.37  Is energy emitted or absorbed when the following electronic 
transitions occur in hydrogen? (a) from n = 4 to n = 2,  
(b) from an orbit of radius 2.12 Å to one of radius 8.46 Å, (c) an 
electron adds to the H + ion and ends up in the n = 3 shell?
 6.38  Indicate whether energy is emitted or absorbed when the 
following electronic transitions occur in hydrogen: (a) from 
n = 2 to n = 6, (b) from an orbit of radius 4.76 Å to one of 
radius 0.529 Å, (c) from the n = 6 to the n = 9 state.
 6.39  (a) Using Equation 6.5, calculate the energy of an electron 
in the hydrogen atom when n = 2 and when n = 6. Calcu-
late the wavelength of the radiation released when an elec-
tron moves from n = 6 to n = 2. (b) Is this line in the visible 
region of the electromagnetic spectrum? If so, what color is it?
