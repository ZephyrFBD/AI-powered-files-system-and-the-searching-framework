dy must be transferred to the outside. Is the heat transferred
by conduction? The temperature of the skin in a comfortable environment is 
33 to 35°C, whereas the interior of the body is at 37°C. Calculation shows 
(Problem 52) that, because of this small temperature difference, plus the low thermal
conductivity of tissue, direct conduction is responsible for very little of the heat
that must leave the body. Instead, the heat is carried to the skin by the blood.
In addition to all its other important responsibilities, blood acts as a convective
fluid to transfer heat to just beneath the surface of the skin. It is then conducted
(over a very short distance) to the surface. Once at the surface, the heat is trans-
ferred to the environment by convection, evaporation, and radiation (Section 14–8).
