we will discuss in Section 9–6.
Elasticity and Hooke’s Law
If a force is exerted on an object, such as the vertically suspended metal rod
shown in Fig. 9–18, the length of the object changes. If the amount of elongation,
, is small compared to the length of the object, experiment shows that 
is
proportional to the force exerted on the object. This proportionality can be written
as an equation:
(9;3)
Here F represents the force pulling on the object,
is the change in length, and k
is a proportionality constant. Equation 9–3, which is sometimes called Hooke’s law†
after Robert Hooke (1635–1703), who first noted it, is found to be valid for almost
any solid material from iron to bone—but it is valid only up to a point. For if the
force is too great, the object stretches excessively and eventually breaks.
Figure 9–19 shows a typical graph of applied force versus elongation. Up to a
point called the proportional limit, Eq.9–3 is a good approximation for many common
materials, and the curve
