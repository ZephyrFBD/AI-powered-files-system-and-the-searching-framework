(a) Water waves passing
        blades of grass
FIGURE 11–46 Water waves, coming from upper left, pass objects of 
various sizes. Note that the longer the wavelength compared to the 
size of the object, the more diffraction there is into the “shadow region.”
Cell phones. Cellular phones operate by
radio waves with frequencies of about 1 or 2 GHz
These
waves cannot penetrate objects that conduct electricity, such as a sheet of metal or
a tree trunk. The sound quality is best if the transmitting antenna is within clear
view of the handset. Yet it is possible to carry on a phone conversation even if
the tower is blocked by trees, or if the handset is inside a car. Why?
RESPONSE If the radio waves have a frequency of about 2 GHz, and the speed
of propagation is equal to the speed of light,
(Section 1–5), then
the wavelength is
The waves
can diffract readily around objects 15 cm in diameter or smaller.
