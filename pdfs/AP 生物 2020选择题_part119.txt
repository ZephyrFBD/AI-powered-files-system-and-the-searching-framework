(A) 
Correct. Individuals with two different bands of DNA have two 
different alleles. Individuals with one band of approximately 2500 base 
pairs have two copies of the mutant allele, which is larger because of the 
insertion mutation.
(B) 
Incorrect. Individuals with two different bands of DNA have two 
different alleles. Individuals with two wild-type alleles would have only 
one band of approximately 500 base pairs.
(C) 
Incorrect. Individuals with two wild-type alleles would have only one 
band of approximately 500 base pairs.
(D) 
Incorrect. Individuals with two wild-type alleles would have only one 
band of approximately 500 base pairs. Individuals with two different 
bands of DNA have two different alleles.
