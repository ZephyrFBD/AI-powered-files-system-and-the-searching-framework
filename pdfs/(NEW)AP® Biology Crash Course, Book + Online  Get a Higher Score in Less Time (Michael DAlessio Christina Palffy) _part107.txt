 organisms are used to create more effective vaccines that are less
likely to cause disease than traditionally manufactured vaccines.
2. Cloning human genes in bacteria using expression vectors has resulted in large supplies of important
medicines such as insulin to treat diabetes and interferons and interleukins to treat acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
C. Research applications of genetic engineering have been extensive. For example, cloning, RFLP analysis,
and PCR and related chromosome mapping techniques have been used to map the entire human genome
(as well as the genomes of many other organisms critical to basic research), creating computer databases
that are widely available to researchers in all fields, including medicine, mathematics, engineering,
computer technology, and other biology disciplines.

Key Concepts
A. Gene Expression—the transcription and translation of a gene into protein—is controlled by DNA
sequences surround
