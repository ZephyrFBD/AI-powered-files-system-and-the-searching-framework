nthalpy change for the 
binding reaction is close to zero, and the entropy change is large and 
positive. Suggest an explanation and design an experiment to test 
it. (Hint: Think about water and ions). (d) You try another drug can-
didate with the DNA target and find that this drug candidate has a 
large negative enthalpy change upon DNA binding, and the entropy 
change is small and positive. Suggest an explanation, at the molecu-
lar level, and design an experiment to test your hypothesis.

Batteries are the most familiar devices for converting between electrical 
and chemical energies. Objects like laptop computers, cell phones, pace-
makers, and countless other devices rely on batteries to provide the elec-
tricity needed for operation.
A considerable amount of effort is currently focused on research and 
development of new batteries, particularly for powering electric vehi-
cles. New batteries are needed that are lighter, can charge faster, deliver 
more power, and have longer
