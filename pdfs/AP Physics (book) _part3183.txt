In a helium;neon laser (He–Ne), the lasing material is a gas, a mixture of
about 85% He and 15% Ne. The atoms are excited by applying a high voltage to
the tube so that an electric discharge takes place within the gas. In the process,
some of the He atoms are raised to the metastable state 
shown in Fig. 28–20,
which corresponds to a jump of 20.61 eV, almost exactly equal to an excited state
in neon, 20.66 eV. The He atoms do not quickly return to the ground state by
spontaneous emission, but instead often give their excess energy to a Ne atom
when they collide—see Fig. 28–20. In such a collision, the He drops to the ground
state and the Ne atom is excited to the state 
(the prime refers to neon states).
