selection, the most successful individuals
in a species are selected by the species to
reproduce
b.
Both artificial selection and natural selection are
processes that result in better-adapted
individuals within a species. In artificial
selection, humans have actively modified plants
and animals by selecting beneficial genes from
other organisms and inserting them into the
target organisms. In natural selection, natural
processes such as mutations and viruses
introduce new genes to a population
c.
Both artificial selection and natural selection are
processes that cause organisms to be better
adapted over time. In artificial selection, humans
have trained animals to be more successful in
completing tasks that the humans want
completed. In natural selection, organisms train
the functions that they will need to survive and
reproduce
d.
Both artificial selection and natural selection are
the differential reproduction of individual
organisms with favored traits. In artificial
selection, huma
