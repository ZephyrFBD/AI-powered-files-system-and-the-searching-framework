the atomic level. Gravity, on
the other hand, is a separate force.†

This comb has acquired a static 
electric charge, either from 
passing through hair, or being 
rubbed by a cloth or paper towel.
The electrical charge on the 
comb induces a polarization 
(separation of charge) in scraps 
of paper, and thus attracts them.
Our introduction to electricity 
in this Chapter covers conductors 
and insulators, and Coulomb’s 
law which relates the force 
between two point charges as a 
function of their distance apart.
We also introduce the powerful
concept of electric field.

CHAPTER 16
The earliest studies on electricity date back to the ancients, but only since the
late 1700s has electricity been studied in detail. We will discuss the development
of ideas about electricity, including practical devices, as well as its relation to
magnetism, in the next seven Chapters.
16–1 Static Electricity; Electric Charge
and Its Conservation
The word electricity comes from the Greek word elektron
