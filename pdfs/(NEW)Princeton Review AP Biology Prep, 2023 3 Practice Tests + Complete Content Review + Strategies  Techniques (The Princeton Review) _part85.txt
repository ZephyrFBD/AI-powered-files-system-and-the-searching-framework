n sequences were used, the sequences might show more similarity because there is more than one codon
for some amino acids. This means that the nucleotide sequence might vary, but the amino acid sequence would be the
same. These are called silent mutations.
Question 6
(a) Identify which color moth was the most plentiful between 1969 and 1995?
Although the two moth colors take turns being the most plentiful, most of the years showed the beige colored
moth being the most plentiful.
(b) Explain why the lines of the graph never exceed 100?
The graph is showing the percentages of moths of each color. 100% would represent the entire population of
moths. It cannot be higher than 100%. The two colors of moths should always add up to 100% since they are the only
possible colors of moth.
(c) Predict during which years there was a drought?
There was likely a drought from approximately 1976â€“1988. The beginning of the drought seemed to happen
quickly in 1976 when the green moths disappeared and the
