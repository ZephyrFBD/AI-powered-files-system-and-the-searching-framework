The SI unit for magnetic field B is the tesla (T). From Eq. 20–1 or 20–2, we see
that
An older name for the tesla is the “weber per meter squared”
Another unit sometimes used to specify magnetic field is a cgs
unit, the gauss (G):
A field given in gauss should always be changed
to teslas before using with other SI units. To get a “feel” for these units, we note
that the magnetic field of the Earth at its surface is about
G or 
On the other hand, strong electromagnets can produce fields on the order of 2 T
and superconducting magnets can produce over 10 T.
