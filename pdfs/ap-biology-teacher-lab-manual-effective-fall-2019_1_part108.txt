uares, you can presume that one-half of all rabbits will reproduce in a given 
generation. Similarly, since one-quarter of all space is covered by white squares, you can 
presume that one-quarter of all foxes will die in a given generation. When a fox eats a 
rabbit, increase the fox population by one and decrease the rabbit population by one. 
During the process, the environment does not change in favor of one species, and the 
genetic adaptation is sufficiently slow. The extent of interaction of the two populations 
(how often a fox eats a rabbit) can be estimated by playing the board game many times.

Some less obvious assumptions that students may raise include a number of 
assumptions about the environment and the behavior of each population, such as the 
following: 
•  The prey population finds ample food at all times. 
•  The food supply of the predator population (which makes fertility, reproduction, and
