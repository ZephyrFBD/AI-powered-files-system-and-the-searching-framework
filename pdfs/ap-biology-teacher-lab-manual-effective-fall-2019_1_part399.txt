2. As a result of this lab, did students demonstrate evidence of what they knew and 
could do within the context of the learning objectives? 
3. Have students record their experimental design, procedures, data, results, and 
conclusions in a lab notebook or have them construct a mini-poster to share with 
their classmates. 
4. Have students develop a list of concepts that they had difficulty understanding about 
the process of cellular respiration before conducting their investigations. 
5. Did students have sufficient mathematical skills required to calculate the rate(s) of 
cellular respiration? 
6. If you used the gas pressure sensors to measure O2 consumption or CO2 production, 
were students able to navigate through the computer interface to the lab
