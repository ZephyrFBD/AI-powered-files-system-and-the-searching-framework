 way the table looks. It
also doesn’t matter whether any person picks up the fork to the left of the plate
or the fork to the right. But once that first person picks up either fork, the
choice is set for all the rest at the table as well. The symmetry has been broken.
The underlying symmetry is still there—the blue glasses could still be chosen
either way—but some choice must get made and at that moment the symmetry
of the diners is broken.
Another example of symmetry breaking is a pencil standing on its point
before falling. Standing, it looks the same from any horizontal direction. From
above, it is a tiny circle. But when it falls to the table, it points in one particular
direction—the symmetry is broken.
Proton Decay
Since unification is thought to occur at such tiny distances and huge energies, the
theory is difficult to test experimentally. But it is not completely impossible. One
testable prediction is the idea that the proton might decay (via, for example,
) and violate conserv
