28. Quinine is an antimalarial drug that is used to treat
malaria in the Western Hemisphere. Scientists have
noticed that this drug has become less effective over time.
Based on the data below, what type of selection is being
exerted on the malaria population?

29. A scientist is studying the genetics of a population of
plants that she suspects is undergoing natural selection.
After examining samples of the population’s DNA over
several years, she finds the following data:
Year
Allele A
Frequency
Allele B
Frequency
1
0.80
0.2
2
0.72
0.28
3
0.66
0.34
4
0.52
0.48
5
0.45
0.55
6
0.39
0.61
Does this provide evidence of natural selection in this
population? Why or why not?
a.
No, because the genotype frequencies, not allele
frequencies, have to change for evolution to
occur.
b.
No, because the allele frequencies are changing
randomly, suggesting that genetic drift is
occurring, not natural selection.
c.
Yes, because it shows that the pre
