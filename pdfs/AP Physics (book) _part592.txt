led. We apply the work-energy principle, noting
that 
and are in opposite directions and that the final speed of the car is zero:
Then
Thus, since the force and mass are constant, we see that the stopping distance, d,
increases with the square of the speed:
If the car’s initial speed is doubled, the stopping distance is  
times as great,
or 80 m.
