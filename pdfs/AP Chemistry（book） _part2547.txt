onsists of 0.30 M Na+1aq2 and 0.30 M OH -1aq2; there is 
essentially no undissociated NaOH.
Give It Some Thought
Which solution has the higher pH, a 0.001 M solution of NaOH or a 0.001 M 
solution of Ba1OH22?
What is the pH of a 0.040 M solution of HClO4?
Sample Exercise 16.8 
Calculating the pH of a Strong Acid Solution
SOLUTION
Analyze and Plan Because HClO4 is a strong acid, it is completely 
ionized, giving 3H+4 = 3ClO4
-4 = 0.040 M.
Solve
pH = -log10.0402 = 1.40
Check Because 3H+4 lies between 1 * 10-2 and 1 * 10-1, the pH 
will be between 2.0 and 1.0. Our calculated pH falls within the 
estimated range. Furthermore, because the concentration has two 
significant figures, the pH has two decimal places.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Order the following three solutions from smallest to largest pH:
(i) 0.20 M HClO3  (ii) 0.0030 M HNO3  (iii) 1.50 M HCl
(a) i 6 ii 6 iii (b) ii 6 i 6 iii (c) iii 6 i 6 ii 
(d) ii 6 iii 6 i (e) iii 6 ii 6 i
