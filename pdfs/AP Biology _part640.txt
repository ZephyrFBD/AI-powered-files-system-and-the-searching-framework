f undigested waste; vitamin production, from bacteria
symbionts living in the colon; and the removal of excess water. Together,
the small intestine and colon reabsorb 90 percent of the water that entered
the alimentary canal. If too much water is removed from the intestine,
constipation results; if inadequate water is removed, diarrhea results. The
last 7–8 inches (18–20 cm) of the gastrointestinal tract is called the
rectum. It stores feces until their release. The opening at the end of the
digestive tract is called the anus.
Hormones that Regulate the Digestive System
Hormones are released as needed as a person sees or smells food or as
food moves along the gut. Table 15.1 summarizes the hormones involved
in regulating digestion.
