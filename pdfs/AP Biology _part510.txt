ntire human population for the next 25 years. Most solar radiation,
though, is absorbed, scattered, or reflected by the atmosphere. Only a
small fraction actually reaches green plants, and less than 1% is actually
converted to chemical bond energy by photosynthesis. However, that
energy is the basis for almost all of Earthâ€™s food chains and fuels all life on
Earth. (An example of a food chain that does not rely on solar energy is
one located around deep-ocean thermal vents.) Ecologists use two terms
when they discuss energy flow on Earth: gross primary productivity and
net primary productivity. Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the
amount of light energy that is converted to chemical energy by
photosynthesis per unit time. Net primary productivity (NPP) is equal to
the GPP minus the energy used by producers for their own cellular
respiration.
Different ecosystems vary in their NPP as well as what they contribute
to the total or global NPP of Earth. Tropical rainforests are among the
