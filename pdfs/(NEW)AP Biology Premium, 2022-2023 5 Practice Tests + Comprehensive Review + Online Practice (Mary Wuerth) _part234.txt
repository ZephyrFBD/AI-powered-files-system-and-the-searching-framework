d enter the cell. Consequently, hydrophilic ligands interact with
receptors located on the cell membrane (cell membrane receptors), as shown in Figure 10.5. The binding of the
ligand to the cell membrane receptor then triggers a series of chemical reactions inside the cell (the series of
chemical reactions are shown as A ® B, C ® D, and E ® F in Figure 10.5). Hydrophobic ligands may enter the cell
by sliding between the phospholipids of the cell membrane. These hydrophobic ligands then bind to intracellular
receptors in the cytosol of the cell, as shown in Figure 10.5. Once bound to the intracellular receptor, the ligand can
then cross the nuclear membrane and bind to DNA in the nucleus, changing the expression of genes.

Signal transduction has three major steps:
1. Reception: The ligand binds to a specific receptor on or in the target cell. The receptor may be located on the
cell membrane (as is the case for hydrophilic ligands)
