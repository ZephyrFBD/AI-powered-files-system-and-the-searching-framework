Sample Exercise 2.9
Practice Exercise 2: (a) Rb is from group 1, and readily loses one 
electron to attain the electron conÔ¨Åguration of the nearest noble 
gas element, Kr. (b) Nitrogen and the halogens are all nonmetal-
lic elements, which form molecular compounds with one anoth-
er. (c) Krypton, Kr, is a noble gas element and is chemically inactive 
except under special conditions. (d) Na and K are both from group 
1 and adjacent to one another in the periodic table. They would be 
expected to behave very similarly. (e) Calcium is an active metal 
and readily
