f k-strategists. The c-strategist survivorship line declines evenly, meaning
that they are just as likely to die when old as they are when young, (C).

Animals and fungi might seem different, but in the grand scheme of life, they are not so distant at all.
They branched away from each other most recently on the phylogenetic tree.

Planctomyces are on the bacterial branch of the tree. Bacteria are prokaryotes and do not have segments
of chromosomes because they have one circular chromosome. They do not need a mitotic spindle during
division, (A). They also do not have a nucleus, (C), or mitochondria, (D).

The Calvin-Benson cycle converts the ATP and NADPH into sugar. If the light-dependent reactions made
sugar and ATP, then this cycle would be unnecessary. Plants already do make ATP from the gradient of
their electron transport chain, (B). They also use ATP in their cellular processes, (C). NADPH is made by
photosystem I, and it still needs the Calvin-Benson cycle.
