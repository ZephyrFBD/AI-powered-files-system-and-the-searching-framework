pectrophotometer can be used to determine the amount of
tetraguaiacol product produced by measuring the absorbance of the solution. The darker the solution, the greater its
absorbance, and the more product produced.
3. O2 generation. An oxygen probe can be used to measure the oxygen product directly as it is being produced. In
this case, an organic reducing agent (like guaiacol) is not used.
 
To determine the rate of a reaction in the presence of an enzyme using a color palette, follow these steps.
 
1. Mix the reactants (H2O2, guaiacol) with the enzyme (peroxidase).
 
2. Take pictures at 1-minute intervals.
 
3. Compare pictures with the color palette to determine the amount of product formed at the end of each time
interval.
 
4. Plot product accumulation vs. time.
 
5. The rate of the reaction is the slope of the line of best fit through the plotted points.
