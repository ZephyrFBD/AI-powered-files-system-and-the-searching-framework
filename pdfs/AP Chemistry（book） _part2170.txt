 the dye molecules are in a hydropho-
bic environment. Predict how the intensity of such fluores-
cence would relate to the concentration of sodium stearate 
as the sodium stearate concentration approaches and then 
increases past the cmc.

Design an Experiment
Based on Figure 13.18, you might think that the reason volatile 
solvent molecules in a solution are less likely to escape to the gas 
phase, compared to the pure solvent, is because the solute mole-
cules are physically blocking the solvent molecules from leaving 
at the surface. This is a common misconception. Design an exper-
iment to test the hypothesis that solute blocking of solvent vapor-
ization is not the reason that solutions have lower vapor pressures 
than pure solvents.

Compounds like sodium stearate, called “surfactants” in 
general, can form structures known as micelles in water, 
once the solution concentration reaches the value known 
as t
