nchrotrons, and hence is called
synchrotron radiation. Synchrotron radiation can be useful, however. Intense 
beams of photons (
rays) are sometimes needed, and they are often obtained
from an electron synchrotron. Strong sources of such photons are referred to as 
light sources.

†Robert Wilson, who helped design the Tevatron, and founded the field of proton therapy 
(Section 31–6), expressed his views on accelerators and national security in this exchange with Senator
John Pastore during testimony before a Congressional Committee in 1969:
Pastore: “Is there anything connected with the hopes of this accelerator [the Tevatron] that in
any way involves the security of the country?”
Robert Wilson: “No sir, I don’t believe so.”
Pastore: “Nothing at all?”
Wilson: “Nothing at all.
”
Pastore: “It has no value in that respect?”
Wilson: “It has only to do with the resp
