GAS EXCHANGE IN DIFFERENT ANIMALS
An exchange of the respiratory gases oxygen and carbon dioxide, between
the external environment and cells, occurs passively by diffusion.
Therefore, respiratory surfaces must be thin, be moist, and have large
surface areas. Although all organisms must exchange respiratory gases,
they have evolved different strategies to accomplish it.
In simple animals, like sponges and hydra, gas exchange occurs
over the entire surface of the organism wherever cells are in direct
contact with the environment.
Earthworms and flatworms have an external respiratory surface
because diffusion of O2 and CO2 occurs at the skin. Oxygen is
carried by hemoglobin dissolved in blood.
The grasshopper and other arthropods and crustaceans have an
internal respiratory surface. Air enters the body through ope
