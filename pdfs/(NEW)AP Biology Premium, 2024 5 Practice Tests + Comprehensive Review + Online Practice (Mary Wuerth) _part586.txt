tting the molarity of each solution on the x-axis and the percent change in mass on the
y-axis, as shown in Figure 24.5.

When a line of best fit is drawn, the point at which the line crosses the x-axis (the x-intercept) represents the
concentration of a solution that would be isotonic to a potato cell, with a 0% change in mass expected if a potato cell
was placed in a solution with that sucrose concentration. The concentration of the isotonic solution can be used to
estimate the solute concentration of a potato cell and calculate the water potential of a potato cell.
Part 5: Turgor pressure is the pressure created by the fluids in a cell when the fluid is pressing against the cell
membrane or cell wall. If a plant cell is placed in an environment with a higher water potential than that of the cell,
water will move from the environment into the plant cell, creating turgor pressure. Plasmolysis is the shrinking of
the cytoplasm o
