ain, (b) greenhouse gas, (c) photochemical smog, 
 
(d) ozone depletion. Give a brief explanation of each term and 
identify one or two of the chemicals associated with each.
 18.62  Suppose that on another planet the atmosphere consists of 
17% Kr, 38% CH4, and 45% O2. What is the average molar 
mass at the surface? What is the average molar mass at an 
altitude at which all the O2 is photodissociated?
 18.63  If an average O3 molecule “lives” only 100–200 seconds in 
the stratosphere before undergoing dissociation, how can 
O3 offer any protection from ultraviolet radiation?
 18.64  Show how Equations 18.7 and 18.9 can be added to give 
Equation 18.10.
 18.65  What properties of CFCs make them ideal for various com-
mercial applications but also make them a long-term prob-
lem in the stratosphere?
 18.66  Halons are fluorocarbons that contain bromine, such as 
CBrF3. They are used extensively as foaming agents for 
fighting fires. Like CFCs, halons are very unreactive and 
ultimately
