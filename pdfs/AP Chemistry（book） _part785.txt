reaction:
∆Hrxn = 3D1C ¬H2 + D1Cl ¬Cl24 - 3D1C ¬Cl2 + D1H¬Cl24 
∆Hrxn = 1413 kJ + 242 kJ2 - 1328 kJ + 431 kJ2 = -104 kJ
The reaction is exothermic because the bonds in the products are stronger than the bond 
in the reactants.
Typically, bond enthalpies are used to estimate ∆Hrxn only if the needed ∆Hf° values 
are not readily available. For the preceding reaction, we cannot calculate ∆Hrxn from ∆Hf°

the value of ∆Hf° for CH3Cl( g ) from another source and use Equation 5.31, we find that
