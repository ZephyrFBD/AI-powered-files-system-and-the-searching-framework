euse as an electron carrier for the glycolytic pathway to
continue. How is this done? Some living systems use an organic molecule as the final electron acceptor. Processes that use
an organic molecule to regenerate NAD+ from NADH are collectively referred to as fermentation. In contrast, some living
systems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor. Both methods are called anaerobic cellular respiration in
which organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen.
Anaerobic Cellular Respiration
Certain prokaryotes, including some species of bacteria and Archaea, use anaerobic respiration. For example, the group of
Archaea called methanogens reduces carbon dioxide to methane to oxidize NADH. These microorganisms are found in soil
and in the digestive tracts of ruminants, such as cows and sheep. Similarly, sulfate-reducing bacteria and Archaea, most of
which are anaerobic ( Figure 7.14), reduce sulfate to hydrogen sulfide to regenerate NAD+ from NADH.
