CHAPTER SUMMARY
20.1 Organizing Life on Earth
Scientists continually gain new information that helps understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth. Each group of
organisms went through its own evolutionary journey, called its phylogeny. Each organism shares relatedness with others,
and based on morphologic and genetic evidence, scientists attempt to map the evolutionary pathways of all life on Earth.
Historically, organisms were organized into a taxonomic classification system. However, today many scientists build
phylogenetic trees to illustrate evolutionary relationships.
20.2 Determining Evolutionary Relationships
To build phylogenetic trees, scienti
