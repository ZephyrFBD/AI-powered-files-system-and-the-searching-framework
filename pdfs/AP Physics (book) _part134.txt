le model is useful in
many real situations where we are interested only in translational motion and
the object’s size is not significant. For example, we might consider a billiard ball,
or even a spacecraft traveling toward the Moon, as a particle for many purposes.
2–1 Reference Frames and Displacement
Any measurement of position, distance, or speed must be made with respect to a
reference frame, or frame of reference. For example, while you are on a train
traveling at 
suppose a person walks past you toward the front of the
train at a speed of, say,
(Fig. 2–2). This 
is the person’s speed 
with respect to the train as frame of reference. With respect to the ground,
that person is moving at a speed of 
It is always
important to specify the frame of reference when stating a speed. In everyday
life, we usually mean “with respect to the Earth” without even thinking about it,
but the reference frame must be specified whenever there might be confusion.
