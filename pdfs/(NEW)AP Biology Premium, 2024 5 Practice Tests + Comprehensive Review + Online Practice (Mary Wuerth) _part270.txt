11. (a) Lectin stimulates cell division, as shown by the increased number of cells in mitosis for the treatment with
only lectin added (compared to the number of control cells in mitosis).
(b) The independent variable is the presence or absence of lectin and/or colchicine. The dependent variable is
the number of cells in mitosis or interphase.
(c) The most likely effects of adding only colchicine to the cells would be that the number of cells in mitosis
would be less than that of the control group and the number of cells in interphase would be more than that of
the control group.
(d) The addition of lectin alone increased the number of cells in mitosis (compared to that of the control group).
The addition of both lectin and colchicine resulted in a number of cells in mitosis that was much closer to
that of the control group than it was to that of the group with only lectin added. So colchicine most l
