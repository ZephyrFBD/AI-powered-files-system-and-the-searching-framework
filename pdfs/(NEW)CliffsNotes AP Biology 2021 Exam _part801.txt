me force is applied, such as that applied by a cell wall.
 
6. Pure water at atmospheric pressure has a water potential of zero (pressure potential = 0 and solute potential = 0).
The dominant mechanisms for the movement of water through a plant are transpiration, adhesion, cohesion, and
tension (TACT). These and other contributing factors are described below. (Consult Chapter 12, “Plants,” for a
description of a plant leaf.)
1. Osmosis. Water enters root cells by osmosis because the water potential is higher outside the root in the
surrounding soil than inside the root. Dissolved minerals contribute to a lower water potential inside the root by
decreasing the solute potential.
2. Root pressure. As water enters the xylem cells (plants cells that transport water), the increase in solute potential
produces root pressure. Root pressure, however, causes water to move only a short distance up the stem.
3. Transpiration. In leaves, water moves from mesophyll cells (the principal plant cells i
