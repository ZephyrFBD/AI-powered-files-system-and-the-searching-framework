g, encapsulated receptors that detect touch, low-
frequency vibration, and flutter. Ruffini endings are slowly adapting, encapsulated receptors that detect skin stretch, joint
activity, and warmth. Hair receptors are rapidly adapting nerve endings wrapped around the base of hair follicles that
detect hair movement and skin deflection. Finally, Pacinian corpuscles are encapsulated, rapidly adapting receptors that
