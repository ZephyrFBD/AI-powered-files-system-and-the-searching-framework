cortisol, and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone. These hormones target the
breakdown of fat into fatty acids in the adipose tissue. The fatty acids are released into the bloodstream for other tissues
to use for ATP production. The glucocorticoids primarily affect glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose synthesis.
Glucocorticoids also have anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of the immune system. For example, cortisone is
used as an anti-inflammatory medication; however, it cannot be used long term as it increases susceptibility to disease due
to its immune-suppressing effects.
Mineralocorticoids function to regulate ion and water balance of the body. The hormone aldosterone stimulates the
reabsorption of water and sodium ions in the kidney, which results in increased blood pressure and volume.
Hypersecretion of glucocorticoids can cause a condition known as Cushingâ€™s disease, characterized by a shifting of fat
storage areas of the body. This can cause the accumulatio
