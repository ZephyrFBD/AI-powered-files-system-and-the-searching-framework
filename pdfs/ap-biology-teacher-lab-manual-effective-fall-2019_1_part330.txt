•  How could you test for the diffusion of glucose? 
•  Based on what you learned from your experiment, how could you determine the 
solute concentration inside a living cell?

■ Designing and Conducting Your Investigation 
Living cell membranes are selectively permeable and contain protein channels that 
permit the passage of water and molecules. In some respects, the dialysis tubing you 
used is similar to a cell membrane, and you can use it to explore osmosis in greater 
depth. Think about the questions that came up as you worked through the investigation. 
What unanswered questions do you still have about osmosis that you could investigate 
further? 
Using the available materials, design an investigation to answer one of your questions. 
Have your teacher check your design first. Remember to record your results, and be sure 
to use appropriate controls.
