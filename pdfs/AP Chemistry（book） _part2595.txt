NH4
+ is a weak acid and will donate a proton to water, producing hydronium 
ions and thereby lowering the pH:

A more unusual situation is encountered with some metal salts. For instance, if you dis-
solve Fe1NO323 in water, the solution is quite acidic. Why would this be the case?
You might think that the nitrate ion is somehow producing nitric acid, but you 
would be wrong. Recall that nitrate is the conjugate base of a strong acid, and therefore 
its reaction with water is negligible. Instead, we have to consider what Fe3+ is doing in 
solution. It turns out that other small, highly charged metal cations like Fe3+ also create 
surprisingly acidic solutions in water (Table 16.6). A comparison of Fe2+ and Fe3+ values 
in the table illustrates how acidity increases as ionic charge increases.
Notice that Ka values for the 3+ ions in Table 16.6 are comparable to the values for
