turies and secured ﬁnancial laws that
allow banks to lend hugely more than they have on deposit in a
conﬁdence trick known as fractional reserve lending. Imagine if you
could lend money that doesn’t exist and charge the recipient interest
for doing so. You would end up in jail. Bankers by contrast end up in
mansions, private jets, Malibu and Monaco.
Banks are only required to keep a fraction of their deposits and
wealth in their vaults and they are allowed to lend ‘money’ they
don’t have called ‘credit. Go into a bank for a loan and if you succeed
the banker will not move any real wealth into your account. They
will type into your account the amount of the agreed ‘loan’ – say
£100,000. This is not wealth that really exists; it is non-existent, fresh-
air, created-out-of-nothing ‘credit’ which has never, does not, and
will never exist except in theory. Credit is backed by nothing except
wind and only has buying power because people think that it has
buying power and accept it in return
