the other. Indeed one and the other are illusions. They are
aspects of the same ﬁeld. Paranormal phenomena are all explainable
so why are they still considered ‘mysteries’ or not happening? Once
you go down this road of understanding you begin to expand
awareness beyond the ﬁve senses and that’s the nightmare for the
Cult.

Holographic ‘solidity’
Our reality is not solid, it is holographic. We are now well aware of
holograms which are widely used today. Two-dimensional
information is decoded into a three-dimensional reality that is not
solid although can very much appear to be (Fig 13). Holograms are
created with a laser divided into two parts. One goes directly onto a
holographic photographic print (‘reference beam’) and the other
takes a waveform image of the subject (‘working beam’) before being
directed onto the print where it
