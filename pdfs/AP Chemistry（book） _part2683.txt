strong acid, the major 
species in solution are HF
, H+, and Cl-. The Cl-, which is the 
conjugate base of a strong acid, is merely a spectator ion in any 
acid–base chemistry. The problem asks for 3F-4, which is formed 
by ionization of HF
. Thus, this is the important equilibrium:
The common ion in this problem is the hydrogen (or hydro-
nium) ion. Now we can tabulate the initial and equilibrium 
concentrations of each species involved in this equilibrium:

The equilibrium constant for the ionization of HF
, from Appen-
dix D, is 6.8 * 10-4. Substituting the equilibrium-constant con-
centrations into the equilibrium expression gives:
Ka = 6.8 * 10-4 =

If we assume that x is small relative to 0.10 or 0.20 M, this ex-
