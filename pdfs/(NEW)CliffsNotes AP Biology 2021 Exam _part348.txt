plasmid DNA to the recipient. In some cases, copies of large portions of a donor’s chromosome are sent, allowing
recombination with the recipient’s chromosome. One plasmid, called the F plasmid, contains the genes that enable a
bacterium to produce pili. When a recipient bacterium receives the F plasmid, it too can become a donor cell.
2. Transduction occurs when new DNA is introduced into the genome of a bacterium by a virus. When a virus is
assembled during a lytic cycle, it is sometimes assembled with some bacterial DNA in place of some of the viral
DNA. When this aberrant virus infects another cell, the bacterial DNA that it delivers can recombine with the
resident DNA. Like conjugation, transduction can transfer bacterial resistance or other pathogenic traits to host cells.
3. Transformation occurs when bacteria absorb DNA from their surroundings and incorporate it into their genome.
Specialized proteins on the cell membranes of some bacteria facilitate this kind of DNA uptake.
