elenium is a nonmetal. We there-
fore need to write chemical equations for the reaction of a non-
metal oxide with water and with a base, NaOH. Nonmetal oxides 
are acidic, reacting with water to form an acid and with bases to 
form a salt and water.
Solve
(a) The reaction between selenium dioxide and water is like that 
between carbon dioxide and water (Equation 7.13):
SeO21s2 + H2O1l2 ¡ H2SeO31aq2
(It does not matter that SeO2 is a solid and CO2 is a gas under 
ambient conditions; the point is that both are water-soluble 
nonmetal oxides.)
(b) The reaction with sodium hydroxide is like that in Equation 7.15:
SeO21s2 + 2 NaOH1aq2 ¡ Na2SeO31aq2 + H2O1l2
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Consider the following oxides: SO2, Y
2O3, MgO, Cl2O, N2O5. 
How many are expected to form acidic solutions in water?
(a) 1 (b) 2 (c) 3 (d) 4 (e) 5
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction of solid 
tetraphosphorus hexoxide with water.
