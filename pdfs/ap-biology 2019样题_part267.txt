Misconception 
Check
Present students with 
common or predictable 
misconceptions about 
a designated concept, 
principle, or process. Ask 
them whether they agree 
or disagree and to explain 
why. The misconception 
check can also be 
presented in the form of 
a multiple-choice or true-
false quiz.
Functions as a formative 
assessment technique.
Provide students with a 
statement on the board, or on 
paper, such as “All mutations 
are bad.” Ask them if the 
statement is true or false, 
and ask them to explain 
their reasoning. Address any 
misconceptions according to 
the answers they give.
