locity of P as seen from S will have components 
and 
We can show how these are related to the velocity components in 
by using
Eqs. E–1. For example,
For the other components,
and 
so we have
[Galilean] (E;2)
These are known as the Galilean velocity transformation equations. We see that
the y and z components of velocity are unchanged, but the x components differ
by v. This is just what we have used before when dealing with relative velocity
(Section 3–8). For example, if 
is a train and S the Earth, and the train moves
with speed v with respect to Earth, a person walking toward the front of the train
with speed 
will have a speed with respect to the Earth of
The Galilean transformations, Eqs.E–1 and E–2, are accurate only when the
velocities involved are not relativistic (Chapter 26)—that is, much less than the
speed of light, c. We can see, for example, that the first of Eqs.E–2 will not work
for the speed of light, c, which is the same in all inertial reference frames (a basic
