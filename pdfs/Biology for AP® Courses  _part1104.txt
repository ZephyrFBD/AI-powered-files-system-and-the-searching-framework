47. Bacteria and fungi produce several extracellular
chemicals, including antibiotics that affect other organisms
in the environment. Antibiotics also are produced
industrially in large bacteria-containing fermentation
tanks. However, antibiotics that have been used by humans
to control microbes are now found at subinhibitory
concentrations in the environment. Low levels of
antibiotics in the environment are mutagenic for bacteria
and promote the development of antibiotic resistance.
Bacteria produce chemical signals that detect population
density and regulate gene expression, a phenomenon
called quorum sensing. Density is
