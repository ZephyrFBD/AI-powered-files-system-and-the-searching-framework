ther’s 
representations.
Allows students to 
practice creating different 
representations of 
data and both give and 
receive feedback on each 
other’s work.
Give students a data table, and 
ask them to graph the data. 
They switch papers and then 
offer one another feedback. 
This can be scaffolded by 
distributing multiple data tables 
that require different types of 
graphs. Students can exchange 
papers and provide feedback 
on whether their classmate(s) 
graphed the data appropriately. 
Idea Spinner
The teacher creates 
a spinner marked into 
four quadrants and 
labeled "Predict, Explain, 
Summarize, Evaluate." After 
new material is presented, 
the teacher spins the 
spinner and asks students 
to answer a question 
based on the location of 
the spinner. For example, 
if the spinner lands in the 
"Summarize" quadrant, 
the teacher might say, 
"List the key concepts 
just presented."
Functions as a formative 
assessment technique.
Present students with a written 
or visual scenario
