 and the vol-
ume of the solution from milliliters to liters.
Solve
The number of moles of Na2SO4 is ob-
tained by using its molar mass:
Moles Na2SO4 = 123.4 g Na2SO42a
1 mol Na2SO4
142.1 g Na2SO4
b = 0.165 mol Na2SO4
Converting the volume of the solution to liters:
Liters soln = 1125 mL2a
1 L
1000 mL b = 0.125 L
Thus, the molarity is:
Molarity =
0.165 mol Na2SO4
0.125 L soln
= 1.32 
mol Na2SO4
L soln
= 1.32 M
Check Because the numerator is only slightly larger than the de-
nominator, it is reasonable for the answer to be a little over 1 M. 
The units 1mol>L2 are appropriate for molarity, and three signif-
icant figures are appropriate for the answer because each of the 
initial pieces of data had three significant figures.
