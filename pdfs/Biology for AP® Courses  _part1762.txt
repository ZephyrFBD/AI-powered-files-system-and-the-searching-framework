Epigenetic Control: Regulating Access to Genes within the
Chromosome
As stated earlier, one reason why eukaryotic gene expression is more complex than prokaryotic gene expression is because
the processes of transcription and translation are physically separated. Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells can regul
