ative to the spot directly above it, in order that the
light does not exit the water?
38. (II) A beam of light is emitted 8.0 cm beneath the surface of
a liquid and strikes the air surface 7.6 cm from the point
directly above the source. If total internal reflection occurs,
what can you say about the index of refraction of the liquid?
39. (III) (a) What is the minimum index of refraction for a glass
or plastic prism to be used in binoculars (Fig. 23–28) so that 
total internal reflection occurs at 45°? (b) Will binoculars 
work if their prisms (assume 
) are immersed in
water? (c) What minimum n is needed if the prisms are
immersed in water?
40. (III) A beam of light enters the end of an optic fiber as
shown in Fig. 23–58. (a) Show that we can guarantee total
internal reflection at the side surface of the material (at
point A), if the index of refraction is greater than about
1.42. In other words, regardless of the angle 
the light
beam reflects back into the material at point A, assum
