vironment, which
is hypertonic to their cells, and they secrete salt through their gills and excrete highly concentrated urine.
In vertebrates, the kidneys regulate the amount of water in the body. Osmoreceptors are specialized cells in the brain
that monitor the concentration of solutes in the blood. If the levels of solutes increase beyond a certain range, a hormone
is released that retards water loss through the kidney and dilutes the blood to safer levels. Animals also have high
concentrations of albumin, which is produced by the liver, in their blood. This protein is too large to pass easily through
plasma membranes and is a major factor in controlling the osmotic pressures applied to tissues.

Use the model of the plasma cell membrane you constructed to demonstrate how O2 and CO2, H2O, Na+
and K+, and glucose are transported across the membrane.
