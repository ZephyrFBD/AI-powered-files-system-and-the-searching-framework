anscription later in the chapter.
Because RNA is single-stranded, we have to copy only one of the two DNA strands. The strand that serves as the
template is known as the antisense strand, the non-coding strand, minus-strand, or the template strand. The
other strand that lies dormant is the sense strand, or the coding strand.
Just as DNA polymerase builds DNA, RNA polymerase builds RNA, and just like DNA polymerase, RNA
polymerase adds nucleotides only to the 3’ side, therefore building a new molecule from 5’ to 3’. This means that
RNA polymerase must bind to the 3’ end of the template strand first (which would be the 5’ end of future mRNA).
RNA polymerase doesn’t need a primer, so it can just start transcribing the DNA right off the bat. The promoter
region is considered to be “upstream” of the actual coding part of the gene. This way the polymerase can get set up
before the bases it needs to transcribe, like a staging area before an official parade starting point. The official startin
