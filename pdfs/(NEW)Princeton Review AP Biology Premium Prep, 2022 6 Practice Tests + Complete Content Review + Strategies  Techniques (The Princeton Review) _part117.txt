rack up points on problems that might have seemed difficult at first.
MNEMONICS—OR THE BIOLOGY NAME GAME
One of the big keys to simplifying biology is the organization of terms into a handful of easily remembered
packages. The best way to accomplish this is by using mnemonics. Biology is all about names: the names of
chemical structures, processes, theories, and so on. How are you going to keep them all straight? A mnemoni
