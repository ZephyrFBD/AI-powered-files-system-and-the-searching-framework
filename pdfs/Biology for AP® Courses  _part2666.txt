H. Water from the roots is
pulled up by this tension. At night, when stomata shut and transpiration stops, the water is held in the stem and leaf by the
adhesion of water to the cell walls of the xylem vessels and tracheids, and the cohesion of water molecules to each other.
This is called the cohesionâ€“tension theory of sap ascent.
Inside the leaf at the cellular level, water on the surface of mesophyll cells saturates the cellulose microfibrils of the primary
cell wall. The leaf contains many large intercellular air spaces for the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide, which is

required for photosynthesis. The wet cell wall is exposed to this leaf internal air space, and the water on the surface of the
cells evaporates into the air spaces, decreasing the thin film on the surface of the mesophyll cells. This decrease creates a
greater tension on the water in the me
