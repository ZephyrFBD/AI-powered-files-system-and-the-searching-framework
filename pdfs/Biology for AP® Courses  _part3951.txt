e marrow to the thymus for maturation. In the thymus, immature T cells that express TCRs complementary to
self-antigens are destroyed. This process helps prevent autoimmune responses.
On maturation, T and B lymphocytes circulate to various destinations. Lymph nodes scattered throughout the body, as
illustrated in Figure 33.20, house large populations of T and B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Lymph gathers
antigens as it drains from tissues. These antigens then are filtered through lymph nodes before the lymph is returned
to circulation. APCs in the lymph nodes capture and process antigens and inform nearby lymphocytes about potential
pathogens.
Figure 33.20 (a) Lymphatic vessels carry a clear fluid called lymph throughout the body. The liquid enters (b) lymph
nodes through afferent vessels. Lymph nodes are filled with lymphocytes that purge infecting cells. The lymph then
exits through efferent vessels. (credit: modification of work by NIH, NCI)
