es can be 1000 nm long 
or even longer but are only about 1 nm in diameter. Depending on the diameter of the 
graphite sheet and how it is rolled up, carbon nanotubes can behave as either semicon-
ductors or metals.
The fact that carbon nanotubes can be made either semiconducting or metallic 
without any doping is unique among solid-state materials, and laboratories worldwide 
are making and testing carbon-based electronic devices. Carbon nanotubes are also 
being explored for their mechanical properties. The carbonâ€“carbon bonded framework 
of the nanotubes means that the imperfections that might appear in a metal nanowire of 
similar dimensions are nearly absent. Experiments on individual carbon nanotubes sug-
gest that they are stronger than steel, if steel were the dimensions of a carbon nanotube. 
Carbon nanotubes have been spun into fibers with polymers, adding great strength and 
toughness to the composite material.
The two-dimensional form of carbon, graphene, is the most recent
