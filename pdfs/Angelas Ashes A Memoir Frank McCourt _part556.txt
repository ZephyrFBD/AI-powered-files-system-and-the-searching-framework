er Alphie, 
 
 taking him out in the pram for a bit of fresh air.The child can’t be kept 
 
 in Italy from October to April. If we tell her we want to play with our 
 
 pals she might let fly with a right cross to the head that stings the ears. 
 
 We play games with Alphie and the pram. I stand at the top of Barrack 
 
 Hill and Malachy is at the bottom.When I give the pram a push 
 
 249 
 
 down the hill Malachy is supposed to stop it but he’s looking at a pal on 
 
 roller skates and it speeds by him across the street and through the doors 
 
 of Leniston’s pub where men are having a peaceful pint and not expecting 
 
 a pram with a dirty-faced child saying Goo goo goo goo.The barman 
 
 shouts this is a disgrace, there must be a law against this class of 
 
 behavior, babies roaring through the door in bockety prams, he’ll call 
 
 the guards on us, and Alphie waves at him and smiles and he says, all 
 
 right, all right, the child can have a sweet and a lemonade, the brothers
