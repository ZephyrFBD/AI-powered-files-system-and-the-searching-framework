t. So the 
friction force the road exerts on the tires is static friction. But if static friction 
is not great enough, as under icy conditions or high speed, the static friction 
force is less than 
and the car will skid out of a circular path into a more
nearly straight path. See Fig. 5–12. Once a car skids or slides, the friction force
becomes kinetic friction, which is smaller than static friction.
Skidding on a curve. A 1000-kg car rounds a curve on a 
flat road of radius 50 m at a speed of 
Will the car follow the
curve, or will it skid? Assume: (a) the pavement is dry and the coefficient of static
friction is  
(b) the pavement is icy and  
APPROACH The forces on the car are gravity mg downward, the normal 
force 
exerted upward by the road, and a horizontal friction force due to the
road. They are shown in Fig. 5–13, which is the free-body diagram for the car.
The car will follow the curve if the maximum static friction force is greater than
the mass times the centripetal accel
