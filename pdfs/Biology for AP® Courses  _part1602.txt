nucleotide
excision.
d.
The fragment exposed to UV light contains
thymine dimers. Thymines lying adjacent to
each other can form thymine dimers when
exposed to UV light. They can be synthesized by
nucleotide excision.
69. Discuss how mutations can increase variation within a
population.
a.
Substitution mutations may cause a different
amino acid to be placed at a specific location,
causing small changes in the protein. Frameshift
mutations usually cause multiple amino acid
changes, increasing chances that a new protein
will form, leading to radically different
characteristics in the offspring.
