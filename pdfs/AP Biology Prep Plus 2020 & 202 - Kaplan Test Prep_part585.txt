al fertilization usually occurs in aquatic
environments and can be seen in frogs, sea urchins, and most fish. In
plants, fertilization is preceded by pollination, the transferring of pollen
to the female reproductive organs of a plant. Additionally, in
angiosperms (flowering plants), double fertilization occurs—one sperm
cell fertilizes the egg cell, and the other fuses to form the endosperm,
which provides nutrients to the developing embryo in the seed.

Gene Regulation and Cell
Specialization
In multicellular organisms, the developmental pathways from zygote to
fully formed organism (adult) involve regulatory systems and diﬀerential
gene expression governed by internal and external signals. Though each
eukaryotic cell contains the same genome, each cell does not express the
same set of genes. Some genes may be continually expressed, but most
gene expression is regulated to maximize energy usage
