Tyrosine kinase receptors are pairs of proteins that span
the plasma membrane. On the extracellular side of the
membrane, one or more sites are present that bind to
signaling ligands such as insulin or growth factors. On the
intracellular side, the ends of peptide chains on each
protein phosphorylate the other member of the pair,
providing active docking sites that initiate cellular
responses. The signal is switched off by dissociation of the
ligand. For each ligand-receptor system, the equilibrium
constant, k, controls the distribution of receptor-bound and
unbound ligands. In systems with large values of k, a site
is likely to be occupied, even at low concentrations of
