2.2: The student can apply mathematical routines to 
quantities that describe natural phenomena.
Learning Objectives
4.14: The student is able to apply mathematical routines to 
quantities that describe interactions among living systems 
and their environment, which result in the movement of 
matter and energy. 
4.15: The student is able to use visual representations 
to analyze situations or solve problems qualitatively to 
illustrate how interactions among living systems and  
with their environment result in the movement of matter 
and energy.
Characteristics of a 
STRONG Response
The student is capable of demonstrating understanding 
that interactions among living systems and with their 
environment result in the movement of matter and energy.
(Part a) The student is able to draw a graph showing the 
effect of temperature change on the rate of transpiration 
that possesses properly labeled and scaled axes with points 
accurately plotted. The student may either connect the
