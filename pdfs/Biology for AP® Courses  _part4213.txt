n produces specific growing seasons
for plants. Plant growth is possible when temperatures are warm enough to sustain plant growth and when ample water is
available, which occurs in the spring, summer, and fall. During much of the winter, temperatures are low, and water, which
is stored in the form of ice, is not available for plant growth.
Annual precipitation ranges from 25 cm to 75 cm (9.8â€“29.5 in). Because of relatively lower annual precipitation in
temperate grasslands, there are few trees except for those found growing along rivers or streams. The dominant vegetation
tends to consist of grasses and some prairies sustain populations of grazing animals Figure 35.17. The vegetation is very
dense and the soils are fertile because the subsurface of the soil is packed with the roots and rhizomes (underground stems)
of these grasses. The roots and rhizomes act to anchor plants into the ground and replenish the organic material (humus) in
the soil when they die and decay.
