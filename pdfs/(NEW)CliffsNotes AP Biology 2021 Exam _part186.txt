 a phosphate group from it.
When these enzymes dephosphorylate the kinases in a kinase cascade, they serve to terminate the signaling
response.

There is both great specificity and great flexibility in transduction pathways. Signaling molecules are specific for the
binding sites of receptor proteins. However, the response that a specific signaling molecule initiates varies with cell
type and the influence of cytoplasmic substances.
The complexity of many signal transduction pathways has several advantages:
Amplification. It provides a mechanism for amplifying the effect
of a signaling molecule.
Control. It gives the cell more control over the accuracy of the
signaling pathway. Because all components of the pathway must
be functioning properly, there is a smaller chance that the
transduction might occur in error.
Multiplicity. A single signaling molecule can activate multiple
cytoplasmic proteins, each generating a different biochemical
response. As a result, multiple processe
