 the smallest fundamental unit of
structure and function in living organisms. (This requirement is why viruses are not considered living: they are not made of
cells. To make new viruses, they have to invade and hijack the reproductive mechanism of a living cell; only then can they
obtain the materials they need to reproduce.) Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular. Cells are
classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Prokaryotes are single-celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane-
bound nuclei; in contrast, the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane-bound organelles and a membrane-bound nucleus.
In larger organisms, cells combine to make tissues, which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related
functions. Organs are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function. Organs are present not only
in animals but also in plants. An organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related
