has two significant figures, corresponding to the number of signif-
icant figures in the mass of solute 122.
Comment Because the mass of the solvent 10.225 kg2 and the 
volume of the solution 10.2632 are similar in magnitude, 
the molarity and molality are also similar in magnitude: 
10.054 mol C7H82>10.225 kg solvent2 = 0.24 m.

Maple syrup has a density of 1.325 g>mL, and 100.00 g of ma-
ple syrup contains 67 mg of calcium in the form of Ca2+ ions. 
What is the molarity of calcium in maple syrup?
(a) 0.017 M (b) 0.022 M (c) 0.89 M (d) 12.6 M (e) 45.4 M
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
A solution containing equal masses of glycerol 1C3H8O32 and 
water has a density of 1.10 g>mL. Calculate (a) the molality 
of glycerol, (b) the mole fraction of glycerol, (c) the molarity 
of glycerol in the solution.
