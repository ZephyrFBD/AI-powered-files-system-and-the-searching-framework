nown as the modern synthesis—the coherent understanding of the relationship between natural
selection and genetics that took shape by the 1940s and is generally accepted today. In sum, the modern synthesis describes
how evolutionary processes, such as natural selection, can affect a population’s genetic makeup, and, in turn, how this can
result in the gradual evolution of populations and species. The theory also connects this change of a population over time,
called microevolution, with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher taxonomic groups with widely divergent
characters, called macroevolution.
Connection for AP® Courses
Population genetics studies microevolution by measuring changes in a population’s allele frequencies over time.
(Remember that we studied genotypes and allele frequencies when we explored inheritance patterns proposed by Mendel.)
For example, scientists examining allele frequencies in a pesticide resistance gene in mosquitoes at Equatorial Guinea fou
