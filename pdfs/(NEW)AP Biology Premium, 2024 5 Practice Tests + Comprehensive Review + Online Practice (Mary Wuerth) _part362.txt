nsfer RNA) folds into a three-dimensional structure that acts as an adapter molecule during
translation. One end of the tRNA will bind to a specific amino acid, while the other end of tRNA contains an
anticodon, which will pair with the appropriate mRNA codon at the ribosome during translation.
rRNA (ribosomal RNA) also folds into a three-dimensional structure. rRNA and proteins form ribosomes that
perform translation. The three-dimensional rRNA acts as a ribozyme, catalyzing the reactions needed in
translation.
In music, transcription means the arrangement of a piece of music for different instruments. Think of transcription in biology as the
arrangement of the “music” of genetic information in DNA for the different “instruments” of mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.
To start transcription, the enzyme RNA polymerase must bind to a noncoding DNA sequence called a promoter.
The promoter sequence does not code for any amino acids and instead serves as a binding site for RNA polymerase
