What mass of O21g2 is produced during this reaction?
Design an Experiment 
In this chapter we have seen that the reaction of potassium metal 
with oxygen leads to a product that we might not expect, namely, 
potassium superoxide, KO21s2. Letâ€™s design some experiments to 
learn more about this unusual product.
(a) One of your team members proposes that the capacity to form 
a superoxide such as KO2 is related to a low value for the first ion-
ization energy. How would you go about testing this hypothesis 
for the metals of group 1A? What other periodic property of the 
alkali metals might be considered as a factor favoring superoxide 
formation?
(b) KO21s2 is the active ingredient in many breathing masks used 
by firefighters because it can be used as a source of O21g2. In prin-
ciple, KO21s2 can react with b
