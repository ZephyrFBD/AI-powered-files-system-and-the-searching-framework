DNA evidence to re­
examine old court decisions? What other arguments can you make (or find) against 
using DNA evidence for court cases? 
4. With genetic engineering, biotechnicians can clip out beneficial genes from native 
plants in foreign countries and insert them into their crop plant relatives here in 
the United States, with great benefits to the latter — to prevent attack by insects, 
to increase productivity, or to allow the crops to be grown in colder climates. 
These benefits can be worth billions of dollars, but if the crops are grown in the 
United States, should countries where the native plants are located benefit from the 
bioengineering? Who owns the information in DNA? Who can profit from that 
information? Investigate this controversy on the Internet with examples drawn from 
different crops grown here in the U.S.
