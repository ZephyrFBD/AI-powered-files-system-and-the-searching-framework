 Pairs
In any acid–base equilibrium, both the forward reaction (to the right) and the reverse 
reaction (to the left) involve proton transfer. For example, consider the reaction of an 
acid HA with water:
 
HA1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ A-1aq2 + H3O+1aq2 
[16.6]
In the forward reaction, HA donates a proton to H2O. Therefore, HA is the Brønsted–
Lowry acid and H2O is the Brønsted–Lowry base. In the reverse reaction, the H3O+ ion 
donates a proton to the A-  ion, so H3O+ is the acid and A-  is the base. When the acid HA 
donates a proton, it leaves behind a substance, A-, that can act as a base. Likewise, when 
H2O acts as a base, it generates H3O+, which can act as an acid.
An acid and a base such as HA and A-  that differ only in the presence or absence 
of a proton are called a conjugate acid–base pair. Every acid has a conjugate base, 
formed by removing a proton from the acid. For example, OH -  is the conjugate base of 
H2O, and A-  is the conjugate base of HA. Every base has a conjugate acid,
