tion. A potometer is able to measure the
water taken up by a plant’s cut stem indirectly by measuring the water
lost from a tube connected to the stem. Thus, (A) is correct. (B) is
incorrect because a potometer cannot directly measure water taken up
by the roots, but instead indirectly measures how much is taken up by
a stem. (C) is incorrect because a potometer does not attach to a
plant’s leaves. (D) is incorrect because a potometer measures the
amount of water lost, not pressure, and because the water is not
actively pushed through the plant’s vascular system but drawn up
using capillary action.

Learning Objective: 7.3
To be an eﬀective experiment, the sample size must be suﬀiciently
large and the variable under investigation must be the only condition
that diﬀers between experimental groups. Because it uses a sizable
sample of 200 and divides the group based on lighting direction, the
experiment in (B) presents the most eﬀective design for testing the
impact of phototropism. (
