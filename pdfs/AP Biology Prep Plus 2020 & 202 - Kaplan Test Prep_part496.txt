libration, transferred
to a buﬀer at pH 8 containing ADP and Pi. ATP was synthesized
and accumulated in the medium.
Which of the following hypotheses about the production of ATP in
the thylakoid membrane is best supported by the experiment?
ATP formation in the thylakoid membrane is driven by the
oxidation of NADPH.
(A)
ATP synthesis depends on the light reactions of
photosynthesis.
(B)
ATP synthesis does not require an intact thylakoid
membrane.
(C)
ATP synthesis depends on an H+ gradient across the
thylakoid membrane.
(D)
5. Platelets circulate in the blood in an inactive state. Damage in a
blood vessel exposes and releases molecules not normally found
in blood, which activates platelets. The activated platelets adhere
to each other and to the blood vessel. This sets oﬀ an enzymatic
cascade that activates additional platelets. Plugging of the hole in
the blood vessel finally shuts oﬀ the response of the
platelets. Which of the following statements best describes the
response of the p
