f activity in DD would be the same 
as the pattern of activity in L12:D12. 
 
(d) To investigate the claim that exposure to light overrides the genetically controlled circadian 
rhythm, the researchers plan to repeat the experiment with mutant mice lacking a gene that 
controls the circadian rhythm. Predict the observed activity pattern of the mutant mice under 
L12:D12 conditions and under DD conditions that would support the claim that light overrides the 
genetically controlled circadian rhythm.
