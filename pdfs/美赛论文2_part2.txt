example to show 
the accurate value of the results in our models. 
We set up our Spread Model on the basis of SIR Model, adding the 
influence of both the drugs and vaccines. In other words, the parameters in 
the original SIR Model are not constant, they will change with time. This 
model can be used to forecast the demand of medication in the future. 
In our Production Model, We divide the whole produce process into four 
stages. On stageⅠ~ Ⅲ, the output of the medication is determined by 
technology and is smaller than the demand. On stage Ⅳ, the output of the 
medication is determined by the demand. 
Our Delivery Model consists of vertical transport（medication distributes 
from the treatment center to epidemic areas）and lateral transport(medication 
distributes from one epidemic area to another). There are two objectives in 
our Delivery Model: To minimize the total cost of the transport and to 
minimize the distribution time.
