rode material? 
Explain. (e) If you don’t think cobalt would work as the re-
dox-active partner ion in the sodium version of the electrode, 
suggest an alternative metal ion and explain your reasoning.
 [7.90]  The ionic substance strontium oxide, SrO, forms from the 
reaction of strontium metal with molecular oxygen. The ar-
rangement of the ions in solid SrO is analogous to that in sol-
id NaCl:
 
In terms of the ionization energy and electron affinity of 
atom A, what is the energy change for this reaction? For a 
representative nonmetal such as chlorine, is this process exo-
thermic? For a representative metal such as sodium, is this 
process exothermic?
 7.94  (a) Use orbital diagrams to illustrate what happens when an 
oxygen atom gains two electrons. (b) Why does O3 - not exist?
 [7.95] Use electron conﬁgurations to explain the following observa-
tions: (a) The ﬁrst ionization energy of phosphorus is greater 
than that of sulfur. (b) The electron affinity of nitrogen is 
lower (
