emical became 
a standard treatment for angina pectoris, the chest pains accom-
panying heart failure. It took more than 100 years to discover that 
nitroglycerin was converted in the vascular smooth muscle into NO, 
which is the chemical agent actually causing dilation of the blood 
vessels. In 1998, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was 
awarded to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro, and Ferid Murad for 
their discoveries of the detailed pathways by which NO acts in the 
cardiovascular system. It was a sensation that this simple, common 
air pollutant could exert important functions in mammals, includ-
ing humans.
As useful as nitroglycerin is to this day in treating angina pec-
toris, it has a limitation in that prolonged administration results in 
development of tolerance, or desensitization, of the vascular muscle 
to further vasorelaxation by nitroglycerin. The bioactivation of nitro-
glycerin is the subject of active research in the hope that a means of 
circumventing
