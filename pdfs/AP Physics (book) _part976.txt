antheon in Rome (Fig. 9–32), built nearly 2000 years ago.
Fourteen centuries later, a new cathedral was being built in Florence. It was
to have a dome 43 m in diameter to rival that of the Pantheon, whose construc-
tion has remained a mystery. The new dome was to rest on a “drum” with no
external abutments. Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) designed a pointed dome
(Fig. 9–33), since a pointed dome, like a pointed arch, exerts a smaller side thrust
against its base. A dome, like an arch, is not stable until all the stones are in place.
To support smaller domes during construction, wooden frameworks were used.
But no trees big enough or strong enough could be found to span the 43-m space
required. Brunelleschi decided to try to build the dome in horizontal layers, each
bonded to the previous one, holding it in place until the last stone of the circle
was placed. Each closed ring was then strong enough to support the next layer. It was
an amazing feat. Only in the twentieth century were la
