understand the compositions of molecules and 
their covalent bonds. However, Lewis structures 
do not show one of the most important aspects 
of molecules—their overall shapes. The shape 
and size of molecules—sometimes referred to 
as molecular architecture—are defined by the 
angles and distances between the nuclei of the 
component atoms.
The shape and size of a molecule of a substance, together with the 
strength and polarity of its bonds, largely determine the properties of 
that substance. Some of the most dramatic examples of the important 
roles of molecular architecture are seen in biochemical reactions. 
Drugs are examples of molecules in which small changes in the three- 
dimensional arrangement of atoms have huge consequences. In the 
chapter-opening image, we see two different molecules: their trade 
names are (S)-naproxen and (R)-naproxen. They have the same chem-
ical formula and even the same number of the same kind of chemical 
bonds; but if you look closely, the posi
