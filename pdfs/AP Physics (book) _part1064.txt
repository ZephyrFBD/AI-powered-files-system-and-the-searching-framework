 volume of the
room divided by the 15-min replenishing time.
SOLUTION Consider the room as a large section of the duct, Fig. 10–21, and
think of air equal to the volume of the room as passing by point 2 in
Reasoning in the same way we did to obtain Eq. 10–4a
(changing 
to ), we write 
so 
where 
is the volume of the room. Then the equation of continuity becomes
and
NOTE If the duct is square, then each side has length
or
33 cm. A rectangular duct
will also do.

10–9 Bernoulli’s Equation
Have you ever wondered why an airplane can fly, or how a sailboat can move
against the wind? These are examples of a principle worked out by Daniel
Bernoulli (1700–1782) concerning fluids in motion. In essence, Bernoulli’s principle
states that where the velocity of a fluid is high, the pressure is low, and whe
