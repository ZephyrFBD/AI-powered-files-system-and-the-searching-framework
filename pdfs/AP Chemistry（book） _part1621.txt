Calculate the ratio of the effusion rates of N2 gas and O2 gas.

the same temperature and pressure in two containers with identical pinholes. If the rates 
of effusion of the two gases are r1 and r2 and their molar masses are ℳ1 and ℳ2, Graham’s 
law states that
 
r1
r2
= A

[10.22]
a relationship that indicates that the lighter gas has the higher effusion rate.
The only way for a molecule to escape from its container is for it to “hit” the hole in 
the partitioning wall of Figure 10.14. The faster the molecules are moving, the more often 
they hit the partition wall and the greater the likelihood that a molecule will hit the hole 
and effuse. This implies that the rate of effusion is directly proportional to the rms speed 
of the molecules. Because R and T are constant, we have, from Equation 10.22
