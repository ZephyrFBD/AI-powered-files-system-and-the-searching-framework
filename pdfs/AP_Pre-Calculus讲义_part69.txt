2.10.5 The Decibel Scale 
The ear is sensitive to an extremely wide range of sound intensities. We take as a 
reference intensity

(watts per square meter) at a frequency of 1000 hertz, which measures a sound that is just 
barely audible (the threshold of hearing). 
The psychological sensation of loudness varies with the logarithm of the intensity (the 
Weber-Fechner Law), so the decibel level B, measured in decibels (dB), is defined as 
=

Example 4 
(a) Find the decibel level of a jet engine at takeoff if the intensity was measured at 
100W/m2. 
(b) Find the intensity level of a motorcycle engine at full throttle if the decibel level was 
measured at 90 dB.
