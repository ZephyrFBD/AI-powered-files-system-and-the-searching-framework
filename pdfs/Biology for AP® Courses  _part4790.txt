r hybrid known as a grolar bear, the first wild hybrid ever found.
Range shifts are already being observed: for example, some European bird species ranges have moved 91 km northward.
The same study suggested that the optimal shift based on warming trends was double that distance, suggesting that the
populations are not moving quickly enough. Range shifts have also been observed in plants, butterflies, other insects,
freshwater fishes, reptiles, and mammals.
Climate gradients will also move up mountains, eventually crowding species higher in altitude and eliminating the habitat
for those species adapted to the highest elevations. Some climates will completely disappear. The rate of warming appears
to be accelerated in the arctic, which is recognized as a serious threat to polar bear populations that require sea ice to hunt
seals during the winter months: seals are the only source of protein available to polar bears. A trend to decreasing sea ice
coverage has occurred since observations
