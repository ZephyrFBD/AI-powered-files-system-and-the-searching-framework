previously: How do we express the concentration of a solid? If 
we were to carry out experiments starting with varying amounts of products and reac-
tants, we would find that the equilibrium-constant expression for the reaction of Equa-
tion 15.19 is
 
Kc = 3Pb2+43Cl-42 
[15.20]
Thus, our problem of how to express the concentration of a solid is not relevant in 
the end because PbCl21s2 does not show up in the equilibrium-constant expression. 
More generally, we can state that whenever a pure solid or a pure liquid is involved in 
a heterogeneous equilibrium, its concentration is not included in the equilibrium-constant 
expression.
The fact that pure solids and pure liquids are excluded from equilibrium-constant 
expressions can be explained in two ways. First, the concentration of a pure solid or liq-
uid has a constant value. If the mass of a solid is doubled, its volume also doubles. Thus, 
its concentration, which relates to the ratio of mass to volume, stays the same. Because
