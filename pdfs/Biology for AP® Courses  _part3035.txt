Nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom vary in structure and complexity, as illustrated by the variety of animals
shown in Figure 26.2. Some organisms, like sea sponges, lack a true nervous system. Others, like jellyfish, lack a true
brain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells (neurons) called a “nerve net.” Echinoderms such as
sea stars have nerve cells that are bundled into fibers called nerves. Flatworms of the phylum Platyhelminthes have both
