ductor of electricity and is insoluble in water. Which 
type of solid (molecular, metallic, covalent-network, or 
ionic) might this substance be?
 12.18  You are given a white substance that melts at 100 Â°C. The 
substance is soluble in water. Neither the solid nor the solu-
tion is a conductor of electricity. Which type of solid (mo-
lecular, metallic, covalent-network, or ionic) might this 
substance be?

 12.19  (a) Draw a picture that represents a crystalline solid at the 
atomic level. (b) Now draw a picture that represents an 
amorphous solid at the atomic level.
 12.20  Amorphous silica, SiO2, has a density of about 2.2 g>cm3, 
whereas the density of crystalline quartz, another form of 
SiO2, is 2.65 g>cm3. Which of the following statements is 
the best explanation for the difference in density?
(a) Amorphous silica is a network-covalent solid, but quartz 
is metallic.
(b) Amorphous silica crystallizes in a primitive cubic lattice.
(c) Quartz i
