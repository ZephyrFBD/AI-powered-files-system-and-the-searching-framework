e
decided there must be a way for populations to evolve and change their traits (i.e., a population of finches
developing longer beaks).
He decided that there must have been a variety of beak lengths originally, but only the longest one was particularly
helpful. Since those finches could eat better, survive better, and reproduce better, they were more likely to contribute
offspring to the next generation. Over many years, long-beak finches became more and more plentiful with each
generation until long beaks were the “norm.” In another example, on the first island Darwin studied, there must once
have been short-necked tortoises. Unable to reach higher vegetation, these tortoises eventually died off, leaving only
those tortoises with longer necks. Consequently, evolution has come to be thought of as “the survival of the fittest”:
only those organisms most fit to survive will survive and reproduce.
Darwin elaborated his theory in a book entitled On the Origin of Species. In a nutshell, he
