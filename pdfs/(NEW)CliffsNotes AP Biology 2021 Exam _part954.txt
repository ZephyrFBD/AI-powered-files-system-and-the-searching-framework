carbohydrates and
lipids, accumulate due to the absence of a correctly functioning lysosomal enzyme. Since cytosol glycogen and
blood glucose levels are normal, plasma membrane transport is not the source of the problems associated with the
disease.
40. D. Allopatric speciation occurs when a geographic barrier creates reproductive isolation between two parts of
what was once originally a single population without reproductive barriers. Once gene flow stops between the two
new populations (reproductive isolation), changes in the gene pools of each population can occur independently (by
mutation, genetic drift, natural selection, nonrandom mating, or gene flow from a third population). Changes in the
gene pool (evolution) of the populations may lead to behavioral, physiological, or structural differences that prevent
individuals of the two populations from mating or producing fertile offspring (reproductive barriers). Once these
barriers are established, the two populations represent two
