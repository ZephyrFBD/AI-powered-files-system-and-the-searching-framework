malaria has a mortality rate of 0.1 percent. However, in some parts of the world, the parasite has evolved
resistance to commonly used malaria treatments, so the most effective malarial treatments can vary by
geographic region.

In Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America, P. falciparum has developed resistance to the anti-malarial
drugs chloroquine, mefloquine, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. P. falciparum, which is haploid during the
life stage in which it is infectious to humans, has evolved multiple drug-resistant mutant alleles of the dhps
gene. Varying degrees of sulfadoxine resistance are associated with each of
