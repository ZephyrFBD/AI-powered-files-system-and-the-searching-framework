CHAPTER 22 Chemistry of the Nonmetals
Oxygen also forms strong bonds with many other elements. Consequently, many oxygen- 
containing compounds are thermodynamically more stable than O2. In the absence of 
a catalyst, however, most reactions of O2 have high activation energies and thus require 
high temperatures to proceed at a suitable rate. Once a sufficiently exothermic reaction 
begins, it may accelerate rapidly, producing a reaction of explosive violence.
Production of Oxygen
Nearly all commercial oxygen is obtained from air. The normal boiling point of O2 is 
-183 °C, whereas that of N2, the other principal component of
