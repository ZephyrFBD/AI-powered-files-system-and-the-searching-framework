 the radial probability distributions for the 1s, 2s, and 3s orbitals reveals 
three trends:
1. For an ns orbital, the number of peaks is equal to n, with the outermost peak being larger 
than inner ones.
2. For an ns orbital, the number of nodes is equal to n - 1.
3. As n increases, the electron density becomes more spread out; that is, there is a greater prob-
ability of finding the electron further from the nucleus.
One widely used method of representing orbital shape is to draw a boundary  
surface 
that encloses some substantial portion, say 90%, of the electron density for the orbital. 
This type of drawing is called a contour representation, and the contour representations 
for the s orbitals are spheres (Figure 6.20). All the orbitals have the same shape, but 
they differ in size, becoming larger as n increases, reflecting the fact that the electron 
 
density becomes more spread out as n increases. Although the details of how electron 
density varies within a given contour rep
