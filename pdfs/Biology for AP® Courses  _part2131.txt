In theory, if a population is at equilibrium—that is, there are no evolutionary forces acting upon it—generation after
generation would have the same gene pool and genetic structure, and these equations would all hold true all of the time.

Of course, even Hardy and Weinberg recognized that no natural population is immune to evolution. Populations in nature
are constantly changing in genetic makeup due to drift, mutation, possibly migration, and selection. As a result, the only
way to determine the exact distribution of phenotypes in a population is to go out and count them. But the Hardy–Weinberg
principle gives
