increases directly with T. Nonetheless, this behavior is readily understood as

The
Fermi level, on the other hand, is on the order of several eV: for copper it is
An electron at 
may have 7 eV of energy, but it can
acquire at most only a few times 0.1 eV of energy by a (thermal) collision with
the lattice. Only electrons very near the Fermi level would find vacant states
close enough to make such a transition. Essentially none of the electrons could
increase in energy by, say, 3 eV, so electrons farther down in the electron gas are
unaffected. Only electrons near the top of the energy distribution can be ther-
mally excited to higher states. And their new energy is on the average only
slightly higher than their old energy. This model of free electrons in a metal as a
“gas,” though incomplete, provides good explanations for the thermal and
electrical conductivity of metals.
