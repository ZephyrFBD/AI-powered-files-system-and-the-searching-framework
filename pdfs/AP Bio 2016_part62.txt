 by the students? 
(A) The conclusion is valid because the 
independent and dependent variables  
in the experiment were controlled. 
(B) The conclusion is valid because the 
experimental design included a large  
sample size. 
(C) The conclusion is invalid because other 
variables in the experiment (both biotic 
and abiotic) affected the results. 
(D) The conclusion is invalid because the units  
of measurement were not given in the 
experimental design. 
 
 
 
21. Butterflies of the genus Colias live in the  
Rocky Mountains, where they experience a wide 
range of temperatures. Different variants of a 
particular glycolytic enzyme in the flight muscles 
are optimally active at different temperatures. 
Within the same population, some individual 
butterflies fly most effectively at 29 C
° , while 
others fly most effectively at 40°C.  Still others 
can be equally active at both temperatures. 
  Which of the following claims is most consistent 
with the observed butterfly behavior? 
(A
