be eliminated. A provirus, as mentioned
in (C), is not actually a type of virus, but rather refers to the genetic
material of a virus that is incorporated into and able to replicate in the
genome of a host cell. A viroid, as mentioned in (D), is a plant pathogen
consisting of circular RNA. Since the virus from the question stem
targeted bacteria and replicated within a monkey, (D) is incorrect.

Transformation eﬀiciency is a number that represents the total
number of bacterial cells that express the gene for ampicillin
resistance divided by the amount of DNA plasmid used in the
experiment. It is calculated using the following formula:
For this problem, the student identifies that 35 colonies have grown on
the agar plate, providing the value for the numerator. The
denominator requires slightly more in-depth calculations. To
determine the amount of DNA spread on the agar plate, the first step is
to calculate how many micrograms of plasmid were added by
multip
