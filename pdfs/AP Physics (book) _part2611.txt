56. (III) How far apart are an object and an image formed by
an 85-cm-focal-length converging lens if the image is 
larger than the object and is real?
57. (III) In a film projector, the film acts as the object whose
image is projected on a screen (Fig. 23–59). If a 105-mm-
focal-length lens is to project an image on a screen 25.5 m
away, how far from the lens should the film be? If the film
is 24 mm wide, how wide will the picture be on the screen?

otal Internal Reflection
35. (I) What is the critical angle for the interface between
water and crown glass? To be internally reflected, the light
must start in which material?
36. (I) The critical angle for a certain liquid–air surface is
47.2°. What is the index of refraction of the liquid?
37. (II) A beam of light is emitted in a pool of water from a
depth of 82.0 cm. Where must it strike the air–water inter-
face, rel
