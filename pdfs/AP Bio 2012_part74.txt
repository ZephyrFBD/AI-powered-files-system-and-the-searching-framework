 2. Plants lose water from their aboveground surfaces in the process of transpiration. Most of this water is lost  
from stomata, microscopic openings in the leaves. Excess water loss can have a negative effect on the growth, 
development, and reproduction of a plant. Severe water loss can be fatal. Environmental factors have a major 
impact on the rate of plant transpiration.

(a) Using the data above and the axes provided, draw a graph showing the effect of temperature change on the 
rate of transpiration. Explain the shape of the curve from 23 degrees to 28 degrees. 
(b) Humidity is another environmental factor that af
