10. Over half of the individuals living in a population where a particular parasite is prevalent are heterozygous for a
recessive allele (Aa). Further studies reveal that individuals who are heterozygous for the recessive allele are
resistant to the parasite, while individuals who are homozygous dominant or homozygous recessive are
susceptible to the parasite. If the parasite was totally eliminated from this area, predict what would happen to
the frequencies of the AA, Aa, and aa genotypes.
(A) The frequencies of the AA and aa genotypes would increase, and the frequency of the Aa genotype would
decrease.
(B) The frequency of the AA genotype would decrease, and the frequencies of the Aa and aa genotypes would
increase.
(C) The frequency of the Aa genotype would increase, and the frequencies of the AA and aa genotypes would
decrease.
(D) The frequency of the aa would increase, and the frequencies
