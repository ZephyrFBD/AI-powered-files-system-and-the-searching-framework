 protein, which allows much greater storage of O2 in their muscles
than commonly seen in non-deep-diving animals. (A) and (C) are also modifications that
are found in deep divers, allowing them to carry additional oxygen to their muscles and
other tissues.

Liquids need to absorb heat to escape the liquid phase and be converted into a gas (the
amount of heat required to do this is called the heat of vaporization). Waterâ€™s high heat of
vaporization enables evaporative cooling because the liquid that is converted into gas
when sweat evaporates into the environment absorbs and removes heat from the body.
(A) is therefore correct. (B) suggests the opposite. (C) is irrelevant for cooling the body.
(D) is factually inaccurate.

In the lysogenic cycle, a bacteriophage inserts its DNA into the bacterial chromosome.
This does not kill the host cell, but it does ensure that the viral DNA is replicated when
the bacterium engages in DNA replication and cell division. In the lytic cycle,
