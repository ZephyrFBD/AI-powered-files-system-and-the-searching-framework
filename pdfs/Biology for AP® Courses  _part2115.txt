evolution?
The mechanisms of inheritance, or genetics, were not understood at the time Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace
were developing their idea of natural selection. This lack of understanding was a stumbling block to understanding many
aspects of evolution. In fact, the predominant (and incorrect) genetic theory of the time, blending inheritance, made it
difficult to understand how natural selection might operate. Darwin and Wallace were unaware of the genetics work by
Austrian monk Gregor Mendel, which was published in 1866, not long after publication of Darwin's book, On the Origin
of Species. Mendelâ€™s work was rediscovered in the early twentieth century at which time geneticists were rapidly coming
to an understanding of the basics of inheritance. Initially, the newly discovered particulate nature of genes made it difficult
for biologists to understand how gradual evolution could occur. But over the next few decades genetics and evolution were
integrated in what became k
