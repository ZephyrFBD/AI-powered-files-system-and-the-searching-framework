ther they point along the positive or negative x or y axis. As can be seen in
Fig. 3–10,
by the parallelogram method of adding vectors.
Space is made up of three dimensions, and sometimes it is necessary to
resolve a vector into components along three mutually perpendicular directions.
In rectangular coordinates the components are

To add vectors using the method of components, we need to use the trigo-
nometric functions sine, cosine, and tangent, which we now review.
Given any angle 
as in Fig. 3–11a, a right triangle can be constructed by
drawing a line perpendicular to one of its sides,
