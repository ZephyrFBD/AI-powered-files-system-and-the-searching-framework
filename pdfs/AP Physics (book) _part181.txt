ate how long the 
ball is in the air before it returns to the hand. We could do this calculation 
in two parts by first determining the time required for the ball to reach its
highest point, and then determining the time it takes to fall back down.
However, it is simpler to consider the time interval for the entire motion from
A to B to C (Fig. 2–23) in one step and use Eq. 2–11b. We can do this because
y is position or displacement, and not the total distance traveled. Thus, at both
points A and C,
SOLUTION We use Eq. 2–11b with  
and find
This equation can be factored (we factor out one ):
There are two solutions:
The first solution 
corresponds to the initial point (A) in Fig. 2–23,
when the ball was first thrown from  
The second solution,
corresponds to point C, when the ball has returned to  
Thus the ball is
in the air 3.06 s.
NOTE We have ignored air resistance in these last two Examples, which could
be significant, so our result is only an approximation to a real, practical si
