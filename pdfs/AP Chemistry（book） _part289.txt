ay be needed to create gas-phase atoms or molecules. 
Next, the gas-phase species must be converted to positively charged 
particles called ions. There are many approaches to creating ions, 
including bombardment with beams of high-energy electrons or 
chemical reactions with other gas-phase molecules. Once gas-phase 
ions have been produced, they are accelerated toward a negatively 
charged grid. After the ions pass through the grid, they encoun-
ter two slits that allow only a narrow beam of ions to pass. This 
beam then passes between the poles of a magnet, which deflects 
the ions into a curved path. For ions with the same charge, the 
extent of deflection depends on massâ€”the more massive the ion, 
the less the deflection. The ions are thereby separated according to 
their masses. By changing the strength of the magnetic field or the

accelerating voltage on the grid, ions of various masses can be se-
lected to enter the detector.
