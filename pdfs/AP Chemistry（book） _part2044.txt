body, and so foods con-
taining these vitamins should be included in the daily diet. In con-
trast, the fat-soluble vitamins are stored in sufficient quantities to 
keep vitamin-deﬁciency diseases from appearing even after a person 
has subsisted for a long period on a vitamin-deﬁcient diet.
That some vitamins are soluble in water and others are not can 
be explained in terms of their structures. Notice in Figure 13.11 that 
vitamin A (retinol) is an alcohol with a very long carbon chain. Be-
cause the OH group is such a small part of the molecule, the molecule 
resembles the long-chain alcohols listed in Table 13.2. This vitamin is 
nearly nonpolar. In contrast, the vitamin C molecule is smaller and 
has several OH groups that can form hydrogen bonds with water, 
somewhat like glucose.
