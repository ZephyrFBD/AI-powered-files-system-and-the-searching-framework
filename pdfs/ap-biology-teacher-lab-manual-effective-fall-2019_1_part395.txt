ith your students 
to help them arrive at their own experimental design and analysis. 
A line of best fit is a straight line that best represents data on a scatterplot. Lines of 
best fit are plotted, but there is no indication of the correlation coefficient or the equation 
for either line. Moreover, you do not know whether these are single measurements 
or means that are plotted. These should be indicated if these data are used to support 
a hypothesis. Likewise, if these points are means, standard errors bars for each point 
should be indicated. (In the example above, Lee was demonstrating what the data might 
 
look like when plotted. You would need to go to Lee’s original paper to view how these 
data were used to support a conclusion.) 
■ Designing and Conducting Independent Investigations 
Now that students have learned how to measure the rate of cellular respiration in 
germinating seeds, they have a tool for exploring questions on their own. They begin 
by thinking about the p
