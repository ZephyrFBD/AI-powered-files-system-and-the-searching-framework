nd data collection methods 
used and articulate the hypothesis. They 
should also be able to plan and implement 
data collection strategies that test biological 
systems, in order to understand and develop 
solutions to problems within biological 
systems. An understanding of how to design 
experiments that test biological systems 
is demonstrated by the ability to interpret 
the results of an experiment in relation to 
a hypothesis. Sometimes, experimental 
procedures will need to be modified in order 
to collect appropriate data; students should 
understand how to modify a procedure to 
collect data and test a hypothesis. 
Preparing for the AP Exam 
Students should demonstrate understanding 
of the relationship between organisms 
and their environment by constructing 
and analyzing food chains and food webs 
and analyzing trophic diagrams. On past 
exams, when students have been asked to 
construct a food web from a data table, they 
have struggled with inferring the correct
