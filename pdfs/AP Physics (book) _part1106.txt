and water spills out of the glass.
(c) remains the same.
(d) drops at first, then rises until a little water spills out.
7. Hot air is less dense than cold air. Could a hot-air balloon
be flown on the Moon, where there is no atmosphere?
(a) No, there is no cold air to displace, so no buoyancy
force would exist.
(b) Yes, warm air always rises, especially in a weak
gravitational field like that of the Moon.
(c) Yes, but the balloon would have to be filled with
helium instead of hot air.
8. An object that can float in both water and in oil (whose den-
sity is less than that of water) experiences a buoyant force
that is
(a) greater when it is floating in oil than when floating in
water.
(b) greater when it is floating in water than when floating
in oil.
(c) the same when it is floating in water or in oil.
9. As water flows from a low elevation to a higher elevation
through a pipe that changes in diameter,
(a) the water pressure will increase.
(b) the water pressure will decrease.
(c) the w
