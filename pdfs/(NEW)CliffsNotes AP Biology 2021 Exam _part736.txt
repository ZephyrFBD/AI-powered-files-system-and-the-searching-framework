ot, identify each plot. If you plot more than one set of data on the same graph,
identify each plot with a short phrase. Alternately, you can draw the points of each plot with different symbols (for
example, circles, squares, or triangles) or connect the plotted points using different kinds of lines (solid line, dashed
line, or dash-dot line) and then identify each kind of symbol or line in a legend.
6. Provide a title for the graph. Your title should be brief but descriptive.
7. Use bar graphs for discrete data. Line graphs, as described above, are appropriate for displaying data when the
independent variable is continuous; that is, the independent variable has a countless number of values in an interval.
Time, temperature, concentration, and light intensity are examples of continuous variables. For discrete variables,
variables that have a limited number of values, a bar graph is more appropriate. A discrete variable may represent
drug treatments, diets, genotypes (such as blood type
