ns are involved in cell recognition, so if a cell lacked these molecules, cell
recognition functions would be impaired. Choice (B) is incorrect because cholesterol, not glycoproteins or
glycolipids, is involved in maintaining membrane fluidity. Endocytosis is a process that requires energy to bring
material into the cell, so choice (C) is incorrect. The Na+/K+ pump uses active transport to create the membrane
potential, so choice (D) is also incorrect.
2. (C) Processes that require the use of ATP to move molecules in or out of a cell are called active transport.
Choices (A) and (B) are incorrect because osmosis and diffusion are both forms of passive transport.
Endocytosis does use energy and is a form of active transport, but that process moves molecules into the cell,
not out of the cell. So choice (D) is incorrect.
3. (B) Cellulose is a component of cell walls; it is not a component of the cell membrane. Phospholipids, proteins,
and glycolipids are all components of cell membranes,
