1. On which of the plates would you expect to find bacteria most like the original non-
transformed E. coli colonies you initially observed? Why? 
2. If there are any genetically transformed bacterial cells, on which plate(s) would they 
most likely be located? Again, why? 
3. Which plates should be compared to determine if any genetic transformation has 
occurred? Why? 
4. What barriers might hinder the acquisition of plasmids? 
5. How can the procedures described above (addition of CI2 and “heat shocking”) help 
facilitate the introduction of plasmids into the E. coli cells? 
Consider the amount of bacterial growth you see on each plate. What color are the 
colonies? How many bacterial colonies are on each plate? Additional questions you 
might want to consider include the following:

1. Do your results support your original predictions about the “+ plasmid” transformed 
E. coli cells ve
