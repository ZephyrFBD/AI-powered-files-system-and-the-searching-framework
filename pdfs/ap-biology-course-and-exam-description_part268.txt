. Students can exchange 
papers and provide feedback

graphed the data appropriately. 
Idea Spinner
The teacher creates 
a spinner marked into 
four quadrants and 
labeled "Predict, Explain, 
Summarize, Evaluate." After 
new material is presented, 
the teacher spins the 
spinner and asks students 
to answer a question 
based on the location of 
the spinner. For example, 
if the spinner lands in the 
"Summarize" quadrant, 
the teacher might say, 
"List the key concepts 
justÂ presented."
Functions as a formative 
assessment technique.
Present students with a written 
or visual scenario of the results 
of a laboratory investigation. 
Using the spinner, ask students 
to predict what would happen 
if one of the experimental 
conditions changed, explain the 
results, summarize the results, 
or evaluate the methods used.
