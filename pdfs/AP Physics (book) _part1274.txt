gether), the pressure is
higher than normal, whereas in an expansion (or rarefaction) the pressure is less
than normal. Figure 12–3 shows a graphical representation of a sound wave in air
in terms of (a) displacement and (b) pressure. Note that the displacement wave is
a quarter wavelength out of phase with the pressure wave: where the pressure is a
maximum or minimum, the displacement from equilibrium is zero; and where the
pressure variation is zero, the displacement is a maximum or minimum.
Sound waves whose frequencies are below the audible range (that is, less than
20 Hz) are called infrasonic. Sources of infrasonic waves include earthquakes,
thunder, volcanoes, and waves produced by vibrating heavy machinery. This last
source can be particularly troublesome to workers, because infrasonic waves—even
though inaudible—can cause damage to the human body.These low-frequency waves
act in a resonant fashion, causing motion and irritation of the body’s organs.
