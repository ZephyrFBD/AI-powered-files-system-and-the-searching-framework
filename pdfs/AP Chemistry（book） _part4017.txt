imate for Zeff was a lower limit; the [He] core electrons do not 
perfectly shield the 2s electron from the nuclear charge. (d) Based on 
the experimental ionization energy, Zeff = 1.26. This value is greater 
than the estimate from part (a) but agrees well with the “Slater” 
value of 1.3 and is consistent with the explanation in part (c). 7.113 
(a) Mg3N2 (b) Mg3N2(s) + 3 H2O(l) ¡  3 MgO(s) + 2 NH3(g); 
the driving force is the production of NH3(g). (c) 17% Mg3N2  
(d) 3 Mg(s) + 2 NH3(g) ¡ Mg3N2(s) + 3 H2(g). NH3 is the limit-
ing reactant and 0.46 g H2 is formed. (e) ∆H °

addition of an electron causes the electron cloud to expand. (b) S2 -  is 
larger than O2 -  because for particles with like charges, size increases 
going down a family. (c) S2 -  is larger than K+ because the two ions 
are isoelectronic and K+ has the larger Z and Zeff. (d) K+ is larger than 
Ca2 +  because the two ions are isoelectronic and Ca2 +  has the larger 
Z and Zeff. 7.37 Al(g) ¡ Al+(g) +
