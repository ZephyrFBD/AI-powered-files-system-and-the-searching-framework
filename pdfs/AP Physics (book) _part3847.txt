 in a rotating system, for which a point farther from the 
rotation axis has a higher linear speed. On the other hand, when viewed from
the rotating system, the motion can be described using Newton’s second law,
if we add a “pseudoforce” term corresponding to this Coriolis effect.

Coriolis effect. Looking down on a
rotating platform, (a) as seen from a
nonrotating inertial reference frame,
and (b) as seen from the rotating
platform as frame of reference.
Let us determine the magnitude of the Coriolis acceleration for the simple case
described above. (We assume v is large and distances short, so we can ignore
gravity.) We do the calculation from the inertial reference frame (Fig. C–2a). The
ball moves radially outward a distance
