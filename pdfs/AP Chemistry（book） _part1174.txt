atomic numbers of the noble gases relate to the numbers 
from part (a)? (c) What topic discussed in Chapter 6 is the 
source of the number “2” in the expressions in part (a)?
 7.10  The preﬁx eka- comes from the Sanskrit word for “one.” 
Mendeleev used this preﬁx to indicate that the unknown 
element was one place away from the known element that 
followed the preﬁx. For example, eka-silicon, which we now 
call germanium, is one element below silicon. Mendeleev 
also predicted the existence of eka-manganese, which was not 
experimentally conﬁrmed until 1937 because this element is 
radioactive and does not occur in nature. Based on the peri-
odic table shown in Figure 7.1, what do we now call the ele-
ment Mendeleev called eka-manganese?
 7.11  (a) The five most abundant elements in the Earth’s crust are 
O, Si, Al, Fe, and Ca. Referring to Figure 7.1, are any of these 
elements among those known before 1700? If so which ones? 
(b) Seven of the nine elements known since ancie
