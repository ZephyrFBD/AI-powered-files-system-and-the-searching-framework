where Equation 19.9 substitutes for ∆Ssurr. Multiplying both sides by -T gives
 
-T∆Suniv = ∆Hsys - T∆Ssys 
[19.13]
Comparing Equations 19.11 and 19.13, we see that in a process occurring at con-
stant temperature and pressure, the free-energy change, ∆G, is equal to -T∆Suniv. We 
know that for spontaneous processes, ∆Suniv is always positive and, therefore, -T∆Suniv 
is always negative. Thus, the sign of ∆G provides us with extremely valuable information 
about the spontaneity of processes that occur at constant temperature and pressure. If 
both T and P are constant, the relationship between the sign of ∆G and the spontaneity 
of a reaction is:
t If ∆G 6 0, the reaction is spontaneous in the forward direction.
t If ∆G = 0, the reaction is at equilibrium.
t If ∆G 7 0, the reaction in the forward direction is nonspontaneous (work must be 
done to make it occur) but the reverse reaction is spontaneous.
It is more convenient to
