ith H having a partial positive charge. These 
two H atoms are consequently acidic.
We will use what we have learned about molecular structure and 
its impact on acidic behavior to answer part (a). We will then 
use stoichiometry and the relationship between pH and 3H+4 to 
answer parts (b) and (c). Finally, we will consider percent ioniza-
tion in order to compare the osmotic pressure of the two solutions 
in part (d).
(d) Osmotic pressure is a colligative property and depends on 
the total concentration of particles in solution. 
 (Sec-
tion 13.5) Because HCl is a strong acid, a 0.050 M solution 
will contain 0.050 M H+1aq2 and 0.050 M Cl-1aq2, or a total 
of 0.100 mol>L of particles. Because H3PO3 is a weak acid, 
it ionizes to a lesser extent than HCl and, hence, there are 
fewer particles in the H3PO3 solution. As a result, the H3PO3 
solution will have the lower osmotic pressure.
