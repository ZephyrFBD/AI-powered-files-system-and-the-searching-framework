reached a depth of over 3,000 m. By measuring the amount of CO2 trapped in the ice, scientists have determined past
atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Temperatures relative to modern day were determined from the amount of deuterium
(an isotope of hydrogen) present.
Figure 35.27a does not show the last 2,000 years with enough detail to compare the changes of Earth’s temperature during
the last 400,000 years with the temperature change that has occurred in the more recent past. Two significant temperature
anomalies, or irregularities, have occurred in the last 2000 years. These are the Medieval Climate Anomaly (or the Medieval
Warm Period) and the Little Ice Age. A third temperature anomaly aligns with the Industrial Era. The Medieval Climate
Anomaly occurred between 900 and 1300 AD. During this time period, many climate scientists think that slightly warmer
weather conditions prevailed in many parts of the world; the higher-than-average temperature changes varied between 0.10
°C and 0.20
