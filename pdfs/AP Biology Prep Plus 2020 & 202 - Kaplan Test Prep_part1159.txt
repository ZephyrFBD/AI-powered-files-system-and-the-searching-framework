for irregular segregation,
however, shows a shiȇ toward the genotype A+B+ in the oﬀspring. This
shiȇ can be explained by biased fertilization, which causes some unions to
be more probable than others. Thus, non-random pairing of sperm and
egg at fertilization distorts the expected ratio oﬀspring genotypes. (B) is
correct. As for (A), unequal recombination—where some gametes end up
with too much genetic information and others with too little—can lead to
disorders in the fetus but would not explain the irregular segregation. The
genotypes of the oﬀspring of the two crosses indicate the same genes are
present. (C) is incorrect because independent assortment is a normal
occurrence, and the gametes that result from oogenesis are haploid, not
diploid. (D) is incorrect because this actually describes the situation that
leads to Mendelian inheritance patterns: when the sperm are all equally
capable of producing viable oﬀspring, then fertilization should be
random, and oﬀspring will show Mendel
