In this equation, r is the radius of the circle in which the particle is moving, and
the subscript “tan” in

Is the lion faster than the horse? On a
rotating carousel or merry-go-round, one child sits on a horse near the outer
edge and another child sits on a lion halfway out from the center. (a) Which child
has the greater linear velocity? (b) Which child has the greater angular velocity?
RESPONSE (a) The linear velocity is the distance traveled divided by the time
interval. In one rotation the child on the outer edge travels a longer distance
than the child near the center, but the time interval is the same for both. Thus the
child at the outer edge, on the horse, has the greater linear velocity.
(b) The angular velocity is the angle of rotation of the carousel as a whole divided
by the time in
