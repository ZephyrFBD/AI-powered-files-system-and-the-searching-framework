places where oxygen is not present.
Yeast are simple cells that carry out glycolysis and
fermentation.
The fossil record of the earliest organisms shows that they did
not have internal membranes or organelles.
Mitochondria were once free-living prokaryotes that were
engulfed by larger cells and provided these larger cells with the
mean
