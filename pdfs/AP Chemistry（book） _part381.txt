Additional exercises 
These exercises are not divided by category, although they are 
roughly in the order of the topics in the chapter. They are not paired.
 2.87 Suppose a scientist repeats the Millikan oil-drop experiment 
but reports the charges on the drops using an unusual (and 
imaginary) unit called the warmomb (wa). The scientist ob-
tains the following data for four of the drops:
Droplet
Calculated Charge (wa)
A
3.84 * 10-8
B
4.80 * 10-8
C
2.88 * 10-8
D
8.64 * 10-8
 
 (a) If all the droplets were the same size, which would fall 
most slowly through the apparatus? (b) From these data, 
what is the best choice for the charge of the elec
