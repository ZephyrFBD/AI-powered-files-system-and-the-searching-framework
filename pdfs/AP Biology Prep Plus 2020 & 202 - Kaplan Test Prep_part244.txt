 of energy into fruit growth.
(C)
The largest fruit is produced by the Sugarloaf cultivar when
artificial flowering induction is used, regardless of the
maturation approach used. This technique allows the plant
to save energy to produce larger numbers of fruit.

5. If an error in meiosis in a diploid plant resulted in the production
of diploid gametes, what would be the most likely consequences
for the next generation?
The fusion of three diploid gametes would produce a
hexaploid plant with six sets of chromosomes, which would
then produce hexaploid gametes.
(A)
If the diploid gametes fused with diploid gametes from
another plant, some chromosomes would be lost to produce
a new diploid plant.
(B)
There would be no possibility that the individual could
reproduce because polyploid organisms are not fertile.
(C)
If the diploid gametes were capable of self-fertilization, then
a tetraploid plant with four sets of chromosomes would be
produced. If this plant could self-fertilize, more tet
