nutrients and environmental conditions can be characterized as growth factors.
Auxins
The term auxin is derived from the Greek word auxein, which means "to grow." Auxins are the main hormones responsible
for cell elongation in phototropism and gravitropism. They also control the differentiation of meristem into vascular tissue,
and promote leaf development and arrangement. While many synthetic auxins are used as herbicides, IAA is the only
naturally occurring auxin that shows physiological activity. Apical dominance—the inhibition of lateral bud formation—is
triggered by auxins produced in the apical meristem. Flowering, fruit setting and ripening, and inhibition of abscission (leaf
falling) are other plant responses under the direct or indirect control of auxins. Auxins also act as a relay for the effects of
the blue light and red/far-red responses.
