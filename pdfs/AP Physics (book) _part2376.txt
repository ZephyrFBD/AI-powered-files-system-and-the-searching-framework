tor is connected to an alternating
source of voltage, as in Fig. 21–41a, an alternating current will flow continuously.
This can happen because when the ac voltage is first turned on, charge begins 
to flow and one plate acquires a negative charge and the other a positive charge.
But when the voltage reverses itself, the charges flow in the opposite direction.
Thus, for an alternating applied voltage, an ac current is present in the circuit
continuously.

CHAPTER 21
Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday’s Law
The applied voltage must equal the voltage across the capacitor:
where C is the capacitance and Q the charge on the plates. Thus the charge Q on
the plates is in phase with the voltage. But what about the current I? At point a in
Fig. 21–41b, when the voltage is zero and starts increasing, the charge on the plates
is zero. Thus
