The Discovery of Atomic Structure

A good theory also predicts new facts; Dalton used his theory to deduce
t 
5IFlaw of multiple proportions:
If two elements A and B combine to form more than one compound, the masses of 
B that can combine with a given mass of A are in the ratio of small whole numbers.
We can illustrate this law by considering water and hydrogen peroxide, both of which 
consist of the elements hydrogen and oxygen. In forming water, 8.0 g of oxygen com-
bines with 1.0 g of hydrogen. In forming hydrogen peroxide, 16.0 g of oxygen com-
bines with 1.0 g of hydrogen. Thus, the ratio of the masses of oxygen per gram of 
hydrogen in the two compounds is 2:1. Using Dalton’s atomic theory, we conclude 
that hydrogen peroxide contains twice as many atoms of oxygen per hydrogen atom 
than does water.
Give It Some Thought 
When carbon and oxygen react, two different compounds can form depending 
on the conditions. Compound A contains 1.333 g of oxygen per gra
