these species all shared a common ancestor that was none of the
animals shown.

(C) The molecular evidence suggests that there are undiscovered fossil
angiosperms that are older than 130 million years old but younger
than 215 million years old. Looking at rocks that span that range would
be the best strategy for testing the hypothesis that angiosperms
diverged earlier than 130 million years ago. (A) is incorrect and
unethical. Scientists need to rely on data to drive conclusions rather
than manipulate data to get the answer they want. (B) is incorrect
because there is no reason to believe there would be any angiosperm
fossils older than 215 million years old. Although scientists would
likely find fossil angiosperms in rock strata younger than 125 million
years old, this discovery would do nothing to resolve the diï¬€erence
between the fossil record and the molecular data. Therefore, (D) is not
correct.
