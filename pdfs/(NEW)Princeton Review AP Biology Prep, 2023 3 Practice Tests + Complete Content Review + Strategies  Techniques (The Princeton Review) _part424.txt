Animals undergo imprinting within a few days after birth in order to recognize members of their own species. While

Habituation
Habituation is another form of learning. It occurs when an animal learns not to respond to a stimulus. For example,
if an animal encounters a stimulus over and over again without any consequences, the response to it will gradually
lessen and may altogether disappear. For example, if a certain hallway always smel
