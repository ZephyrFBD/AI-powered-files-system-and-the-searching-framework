ent only apply to traits coded for by genes that are located on
separate chromosomes. As discussed in Chapter 12, genes that are close together on the same chromosome are linked and tend to be inherited together
more often. Mendel’s laws of segregation and independent assortment do not apply to linked genes.
Mendel’s law of segregation states that an organism carries two variations of every trait (called alleles), one
from each parent, and these alleles segregate, or separate, independently into gametes. This segregation occurs
during anaphase of meiosis. When homologous chromosomes separate during anaphase I, the alleles on those
chromosomes will segregate into separate gametes. One variation (or allele) for a trait ends up in each gamete. When
two gametes join during fertilization, the resulting offspring then again has two alleles for the trait.
Mendel’s law of independent assortment states that genes for different traits segregate independently of one
another. This independent asso
