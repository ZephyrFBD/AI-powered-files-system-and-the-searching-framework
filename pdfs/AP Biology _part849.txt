ne half of the choice chamber. Before you put the flies into the
chamber, make sure that you can control and measure the temperature of
each chamber. Be careful that the temperature is not too warm or too cold.
Carry out the experiment in the same way as before. After the same
amount of time as before, carefully count the flies in each chamber to
gather quantitative data.
You must always include a control in any experiment. In this case, your

the light or temperature. After all, you have to make sure that the flies are
not moving from one part of the chamber to the other solely by chance.
LAB #13: ENZYME CATALYSIS
Introduction
In general, the rate at which enzymes catalyze reactions is altered by
environmental factors such as pH, temperature, inhibitors, and salt
concentration. In this lab, the enzyme used is one that is found in all
aerobic cells: peroxidase. Its fu
