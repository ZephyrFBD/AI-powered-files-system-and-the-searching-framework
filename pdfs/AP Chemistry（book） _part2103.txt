A sample of 2.05 g of polystyrene of uniform polymer chain 
length was dissolved in enough toluene to form 0.100 L of solu-
tion. The osmotic pressure of this solution was found to be 1.21 
kPa at 25 °C. Calculate the molar mass of the polystyrene.
reduction in the freezing-point depression (as well as in boiling-point 
elevation, vapor–pressure reduction, and osmotic pressure).
We have been assuming that the van’t Hoff factor, i, is equal to 
the number of ions per formula unit of the electrolyte. The true (mea-
sured) value of this factor, however, is given by the ratio of the mea-
sured value of a colligative property to the value calculated when the 
substance is assumed to be a nonelectrolyte. Using the freezing-point 
depression, for example, we have
