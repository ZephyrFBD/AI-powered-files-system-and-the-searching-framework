Figure 13.8 As with many polyploid plants, this triploid orange daylily (Hemerocallis fulva) is particularly large and
robust, and grows flowers with triple the number of petals of its diploid counterparts. (credit: Steve Karg)
Sex Chromosome Nondisjunction in Humans
Humans display dramatic deleterious effects with autosomal trisomies and monosomies. Therefore, it may seem
counterintuitive that human females and males can function normally, despite carrying different numbers of the X
chromosome. Rather than a gain or loss of autosomes, variations in the number of sex chromosomes are associated with
relatively mild effects. In part, this occurs because of a molecular process called X inactivation. Early in development,
when female mammalian embryos consist of just a few thousand cells (relative to trillions in the newborn), one X
chromosome in each cell inactivates by tightly condensing into a quiescent (dormant) structure called a Barr body. The
chance th
