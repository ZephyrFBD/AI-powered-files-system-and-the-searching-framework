ependence of Resistivity
The resistivity of a material depends somewhat on temperature. The resistance of
metals generally increases with temperature. This is not surprising, because at higher
temperatures, the atoms are moving more rapidly and are arranged in a less orderly
fashion. So they might be expected to interfere more with the flow of electrons. If
the temperature change is not too great, the resistivity of metals usually increases
nearly linearly with temperature. That is,
(18;4)
where 
is the resistivity at some reference temperature 
(such as 0°C or 20°C),
is the resistivity at a temperature T, and 
is the temperature coefficient of
resistivity. Values for are given in Table 18–1. Note that the temperature coefficient
for semiconductors can be negative. Why? It seems that at higher temperatures,
some of the electrons that are normally not free in a semiconductor become free
and can contribute to the current. Thus, the resistance of a semiconductor can
decrease with an incre
