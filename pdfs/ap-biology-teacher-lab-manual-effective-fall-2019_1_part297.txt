hink about 10 dump trucks and 10 small 
cars at the opposite end zones of a football field. Then ask them to predict which vehicles 
will scatter faster across the field. Most will understand that large dump trucks move 
more slowly (have a lower kinetic energy) than the smaller cars. 
■ Skills Development 
Students will develop the following skills, which are reinforced in the transpiration  
investigation:  
• Calculating surface area and volume of a model cell 
• Designing experiments to measure the rate of osmosis in model cells 
• Designing experiments to measure water potential in plant cells 
■ Potential Challenges 
Students struggle with the concepts of the random nature of diffusion (nondirectional) 
and kinetic energy. A good demonstration is to drop some coins over a table to show that 
they spread out in all directions; as the height increases (more kinetic energy), the coins 
spread out farther from each other.
