rce of the Earth pulling it into orbit. In fact,
a satellite in orbit is falling (accelerating) toward Earth, but its high tangential
speed keeps it from hitting Earth.
For satellites that move in a circle (at least approximately), the needed acceler-
ation is centripetal and equals 
The force that gives a satellite this acceleration
is the force of gravity exerted by the Earth, and since a satellite may be at a 
considerable distance from the Earth, we must use Newton’s law of universal
gravitation (Eq. 5–4) for the force acting on it. When we apply Newton’s second
law,
in the radial direction, we find
(5;6)
where m is the mass of the satellite. This equation relates the distance of 
the satellite from the Earth’s center, r, to its speed, v, in a circular orbit.
Note that only one force—gravity—is acting on the satellite, and that r is the sum
of the Earth’s radius 
plus the satellite’s height h above the Earth: r = rE + h.
