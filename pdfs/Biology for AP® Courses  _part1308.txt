ns on homologous chromosomes are called alleles. Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele
forms, but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population.
Phenotypes and Genotypes
Two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics. The
observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype. An organism’s underlying genetic makeup,
consisting of both physically visible and non-expressed alleles, is called its genotype. Mendel’s hybridization experiments
demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype. When true-breeding plants in which one parent had yellow
pods and one had green pods were cross-fertilized, all of the F1 hybrid offspring had yellow pods. That is, the hybrid
offspring were phenotypically identical to the true-breeding parent with yellow pods. However, we know that the allele
donated by the parent with green pods was not
