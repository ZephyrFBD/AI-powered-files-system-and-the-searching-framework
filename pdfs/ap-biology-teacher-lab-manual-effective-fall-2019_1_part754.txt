ology Information website 
offers access to biomedical and genomic information. The database could be used 
as extensions for students or teachers interested in some of the specific sequences of 
DNA or proteins that are characteristic of some of the different Drosophila mutants.

to many other resources. Teachers or students interested in finding more information 
about a particular mutant or images of fruit flies or understand
