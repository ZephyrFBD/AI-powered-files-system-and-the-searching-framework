 of times per second. When a person passes
through the walk-through, any metal object being carried will have eddy currents
induced in it, and the small magnetic field produced by that eddy current can be
detected, setting off an alert or alarm.

1–7 Transformers and
Transmission of Power
A transformer is a device for increasing or decreasing an ac voltage. Transformers
are found everywhere: on utility poles (Fig. 21–22) to reduce the high voltage from
the electric company to a usable voltage in houses (120 V or 240 V), in chargers for
cell phones, laptops, and other electrical devices, in your car to give the needed
high voltage to the spark plugs, and in many other applications. A transformer
consists of two coils of wire known as the primary and secondary coils. The 
two coils can be interwoven (with insulated wire); or they can be linked by an
iron core which is laminated to minimize eddy-current losses (Section 21–6),
as shown in Fig. 21–23. Transformers are designed so that (nea
