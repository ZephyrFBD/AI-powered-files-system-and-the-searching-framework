2. (I) Calculate the mass m needed in order to suspend the
leg shown in Fig. 9–47. Assume the leg (with cast) has a
mass of 15.0 kg, and its CG is 35.0 cm from the hip joint; the
cord holding the sling is 78.0 cm from the hip joint.
3. (I) A tower crane (Fig. 9–48a) must always be carefully
balanced so that there is no net torque tending to tip it.
A particular crane at a building site is about to lift a 
2800-kg air-conditioning unit.
