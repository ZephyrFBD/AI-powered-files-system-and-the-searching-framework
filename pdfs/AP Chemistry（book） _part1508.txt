 in a bond, the weaker the bond. 
(b) The greater the orbital overlap in a bond, the shorter the 
bond. (c) To create a hybrid orbital, you could use the s orbital 
on one atom with a p orbital on another atom. (d) Nonbond-
ing electron pairs cannot occupy a hybrid orbital.
 9.48  How would you expect the extent of overlap of the bond-
ing atomic orbitals to vary in the series IF, ICl, IBr, and I2?  
Explain your answer.
 9.49 Consider the molecule BF3. (a) What is the electron config-
uration of an isolated B atom? (b) What is the electron con-
figuration of an isolated F atom? (c) What hybrid orbitals 
should be constructed on the B atom to make the Bâ€“F bonds 
in BF3? (d) What valence orbitals, if any, remain unhybrid-
ized on the B atom in BF3?
 9.50  Consider the SCl2 molecule. (a) What is the electron config-
uration of an isolated S atom? (b) What is the electron con-
figuration of an isolated Cl atom? (c) What hybrid orbitals 
should be constructed on the S atom to make the S-Cl
