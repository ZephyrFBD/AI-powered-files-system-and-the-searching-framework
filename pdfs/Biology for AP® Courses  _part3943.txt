lizes the antigen and
presents it on MHC II. A helper T cell recognizes the MHC IIâ€“antigen complex and activates the B cell. As a result,
memory B cells and plasma cells are made.
Why are both plasma B cells and memory B cells made when helper T cells activate B cells?
a.
Plasma B cells produce antibodies to fight against pathogen. Memory B cells retain the information about
this particular pathogen so that during the subsequent exposure to the same pathogen, a stronger response
can be generated.
b.
Plasma B cells phagocytose the pathogen. Memory B cells retain the information about this particular
pathogen so that during the subsequent exposure to the same pathogen, a stronger response can be generated.
c.
Plasma B cells produce antibodies to fight against a pathogen. Memory B cells retain the information about
this particular pathogen so that during the subsequent exposure to the same pathogen, a stronger response
can be generated, but antibodies are not produced.
d.
Plasma B cells p
