ees have the fewest number of amino acid differences from humans in their cytochrome c protein,
so they are placed closest to humans on the cladogram as the most recent common ancestor. Tuna have the
greatest number of amino acid differences from humans in their cytochrome c protein, so they are placed
farthest from humans on the cladogram as the most distant common ancestor. The other organisms are
placed in order of the number of amino acid differences from humans. Those with fewer differences are
closer to humans, and those with more differences are closer to tuna.
(d) One could look at the number of amino acid differences in a different protein to see if chickens still have
fewer amino acid differences from humans than turtles do. One could also look at DNA sequences of the
three species or look for homologous structures.

(a) When stomata open, the plant can take in the carbon dioxide it needs for photosynthesis. However, when
stomata open, the plant can also lose water through
