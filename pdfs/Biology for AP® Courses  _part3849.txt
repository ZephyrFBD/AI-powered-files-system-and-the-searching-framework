CHAPTER SUMMARY
32.1 Osmoregulation and Osmotic Balance
Solute concentrations across a semi-permeable membranes influence the movement of water and solutes across the
membrane. It is the number of solute molecules and not the molecular size that is important in osmosis. Osmoregulation
and osmotic balance are important bodily functions, resulting in water and salt balance. Not all solutes can pass through a
semi-permeable membrane. Osmosis is the movement of water across the membrane. Osmosis occurs to equalize the
number o
