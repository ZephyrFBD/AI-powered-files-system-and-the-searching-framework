 Eliot (from Murder in the Cathedral) has the women of
Canterbury say “the earth presses up against our feet.” What force is this?
(a) Gravity.
(b) The normal force.
(c) A friction force.
(d) Centrifugal force.
(e) No force—they are being poetic.

e have discussed how motion is described in terms of velocity and
acceleration. Now we deal with the question of why objects move as
they do: What makes an object at rest begin to move? What causes 
an object to accelerate or decelerate? What is involved when an object moves 
in a curved path? We can answer in each case that a force is required. In this
Chapter†, we will investigate the connection between force and motion, which is
the subject called dynamics.
4–1 Force
Intuitively, we experience force as any kind of a push or a pull on an object. When
you push a stalled car or a grocery cart (Fig. 4–1), you are exerting a force on it.
When a motor lifts an elevator, or a hammer hits a nail,
