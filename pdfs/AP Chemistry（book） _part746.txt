The heat released when combustion occurs is absorbed by the water and the various 
components of the calorimeter (which all together make up the surroundings), causing 
the water temperature to rise. The change in water temperature caused by the reaction is 
measured very precisely.
To calculate the heat of combustion from the measured temperature increase, we 
must know the total heat capacity of the calorimeter, Ccal. This quantity is determined 
by combusting a sample that releases a known quantity of heat and measuring the tem-
perature change. For example, combustion of  
exactly 1 g of benzoic acid, C6H5COOH, in 
a bomb calorimeter produces 26.38 kJ of heat. Suppose 1.000 g of benzoic acid is com-
busted in a calorimeter, leading to a temperature increase of 4.857 °C. The heat capacity 
of the calorimeter is then Ccal = 26.38 kJ>4.857 °C = 5.431 kJ>°C. Once we know Ccal, 
we can measure temperature changes produced by other reactions, and from these we 
can calculate
