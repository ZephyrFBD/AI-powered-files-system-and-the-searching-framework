rmone/ligand, the signal to absorb glucose from the Petri
dish would not occur, and the glucose level in the Petri dish would remain unchanged.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) Step 1 represents reception of the signal. Steps 2, 3, and 4 represent transduction. Step 5 represents the
response.
(b) The control is the cell in which adrenaline alone has been added. The independent variable is the presence
or absence of molecules X, Y, or Z. The dependent variables are the activation of the G-protein, the
production of cAMP, and the activation of transcription of target gene A.
(c) Molecule X and molecule Y most likely interfere with adenylyl cyclase because no cAMP was produced
when those molecules were added to the cells. Molecule Y also most likely interferes with the GDP on the
G-protein receptor since it was never activated.
(d) If cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase was added to the cell, the conversion of the inactive protein kinase to
activated protein kinase (step 4) would most likely be af
