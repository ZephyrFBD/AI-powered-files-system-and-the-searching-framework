s, they are nonvolatile (that is, they don’t evap-
orate readily) and nonflammable. They tend to remain in the 
liquid state at temperatures up to about 400 °C. Most molecular 
substances are liquids only at much lower 
temperatures, 100 °C or less in most cases. 
Because ionic liquids are good solvents for a 
wide range of substances, ionic liquids can 
be used for a variety of reactions and separa-
tions. These properties make them attractive 
replacements for volatile organic solvents in 
many industrial processes. Relative to tradi-
tional organic solvents, ionic liquids offer 
the promise of reduced volumes, safer han-
dling, and easier reuse, thereby reducing the 
environmental impact of industrial chemi-
cal processes.
