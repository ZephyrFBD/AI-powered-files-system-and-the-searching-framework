ymes are made of
proteins, which have a three-dimensional tertiary structure that is specific to their function. (Ribozymes are
biological catalysts that are made of RNA.)
The active site of an enzyme interacts with the substrate (or reactant). The shape of the active site on the
enzyme is specific to the shape of the substrate, as shown in Figure 7.1. The substrate must be able to fit into the
active site to interact with the enzyme. If there are any charged R-groups on amino acids within the active site of the
enzyme, there must be compatible charges on the substrate. For example, an active site that contained positively
charged amino acids would repel any positively charged molecules, even if the molecule’s shape could fit in the
enzyme’s active site.

Environmental Factors that Affect Enzyme Function
Enzymes catalyze reactions most efficiently at optimum temperatures and pHs that are specific to the enzyme. If the
temperature in the environment is too low, t
