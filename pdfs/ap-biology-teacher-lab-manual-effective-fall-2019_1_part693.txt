If using potometers, when inserting the plant cutting into the plastic tubing, students 
often leave a small gap between the end of the stem and the top of the column of 
water; the column of water must make direct contact with the xylem in the stem for 
transpiration to occur. Students also struggle with filling the plastic tubing with water 
without forming air bubbles. One trick is to attach a small plastic syringe (without a 
needle) to the end of the pipette with a piece of rubber tubing and use the syringe to 
pull water up into the potometer, leaving the syringe attached to keep the water under 
negative tension. 
Once the plant cutting is in place and the tubing/pipette completely filled with 
water, the syringe is carefully removed. In place of using petroleum jelly to prevent the 
apparatus from leaking, small, inexpensive clamps work well. If using a 0.1-mL pipette 
to record water loss, students can have difficulty reading the small incre
