19–4 EMFs in Series and in Parallel;
Charging a Battery
When two or more sources of emf, such as batteries, are arranged in series as in
Fig. 19–14a, the total voltage is the algebraic sum of their respective voltages. On
the other hand, when a 20-V and a 12-V battery are connected oppositely, as shown
in Fig. 19–14b, the net voltage 
is 8 V (ignoring voltage drop across internal
resistances). That is, a positive test charge moved from a to b gains in potential
