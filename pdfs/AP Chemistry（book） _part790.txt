The combustion of carbohydrates and fats in a bomb calorimeter gives the same 
products as when they are metabolized in the body. The metabolism of proteins pro-
duces less energy than combustion in a calorimeter because the products are different. 
Proteins contain nitrogen, which is released in the bomb calorimeter as N2. In the body 
this nitrogen ends up mainly as urea, 1NH222CO. Proteins are used by the body mainly 
as building materials for organ walls, skin, hair, muscle, and so forth. On average, the 
metabolism of proteins produces 17 kJ>g 14 kcal>g2, the same as for carbohydrates.
Fuel values for some common foods are shown in Table 5.5. Labels on packaged foods 
show the amounts of carbohydrate, fat, and protein contained in an average serving, as 
well as the amount of energy supplied by a serving (Figure 5.25).
The amount of energy our bodies require varies considerably, depending on such 
factors as weight, age, and muscular activity. About 100 kJ per kilogram of
