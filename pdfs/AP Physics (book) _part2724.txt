 its color.
The visible spectrum in air extends from about 400 nm (violet)
to about 750 nm (red).
Glass prisms spread white light into its constituent colors
because the index of refraction varies with wavelength, a phe-
nomenon known as dispersion.
The formula
for constructive interference
also holds for a diffraction grating, which consists of many 
parallel slits or lines, separated from each other by a distance d.

The peaks of constructive interference are much brighter and
sharper for a diffraction grating than for a two-slit apparatus.
A diffraction grating (or a prism) is used in a spectrometer
to separate different colors and observe line spectra. For a given

Diffraction refers to the fact that light, like other waves,
bends around objects it pas
