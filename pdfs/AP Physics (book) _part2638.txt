 two closely spaced slits,
and 
(The slits and their sepa-
ration are very narrow, not much larger than the wavelength of the light.) If light
consists of tiny particles, we would expect to see two bright lines on a screen placed
behind the slits as in (b). But instead, a series of bright lines are seen as in (c).
Young was able to explain this result as a wave-interference phenomenon.
To understand why, consider plane waves† of light of a single wavelength—
called monochromatic, meaning “one color”—falling on the two slits as shown in
Fig. 24–6. Because of diffraction, the waves leaving the two small slits spread out
as shown. This is equivalent to the interference pattern produced when two rocks
are thrown into a lake (Fig. 11–38), or when sound from two loudspeakers inter-
feres (Fig. 12–16). Recall Section 11–11 on wave interference.
