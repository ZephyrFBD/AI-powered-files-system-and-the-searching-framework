er. At the same time, the monomers share electrons and form covalent bonds.
As additional monomers join, this chain of repeating monomers forms a polymer. Different types of monomers can combine
in many configurations, giving rise to a diverse group of macromolecules. Even one kind of monomer can combine in a
variety of ways to form several different polymers: for example, glucose monomers are the constituents of starch, glycogen,
and cellulose.
Hydrolysis
Polymers are broken down into monomers in a process known as hydrolysis, which means “to split with water.” Hydrolysis
is a reaction in which a water molecule is used during the breakdown of another compound (Figure 3.3). During these
reactions, the polymer is broken into two components: one part gains a hydrogen atom (H+) and the other gains a hydroxyl
molecule (OH–) from a split water molecule.
Figure 3.3 In the hydrolysis reaction shown here, the disaccharide maltose is broken down to form two glucose
monomers with the addition of
