diately obvious that this type of learning is different than conditioning. Although one might be tempted
to believe that the rats simply learned how to find their way through a conditioned series of right and left turns, E.C. Tolman
proved a decade later that the rats were making a representation of the maze in their minds, which he called a “cognitive

humans.
