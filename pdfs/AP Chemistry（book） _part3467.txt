 21.48  How much energy must be supplied to break a single 21Ne 
nucleus into separated protons and neutrons if the nucleus 
has a mass of 20.98846 amu? What is the nuclear binding 
energy for 1 mol of 21Ne?
 21.49  The atomic masses of hydrogen-2 (deuterium), helium-4, 
and lithium-6 are 2.014102 amu, 4.002602 amu, and 
6.0151228 amu, respectively. For each isotope, calculate 
(a) the nuclear mass, (b) the nuclear binding energy, 
 
(c) the nuclear binding energy per nucleon. (d) Which of 
these three isotopes has the largest nuclear binding energy 
per nucleon? Does this agree with the trends plotted in 
 
Figure 21.12?
 21.50  The atomic masses of nitrogen-14, titanium-48, and 
xenon-129 are 13.999234 amu, 47.935878 amu, and 
128.904779 amu, respectively. For each isotope, calcu-
late (a) the nuclear mass, (b) the nuclear binding energy, 
 
(c) the nuclear binding energy per nucleon.
