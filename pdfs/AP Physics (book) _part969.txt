al to mg on pin A to support the mass m of the upper bridge. Why? Because
the pin is in equilibrium, and the other force that balances this is the downward
force mg exerted on it by the upper bridge (Fig. 9–27c). There is thus a shear
stress on the pin because the rod pulls up on one side of the pin, and the bridge
pulls down on the other side. The situation when two shorter rods support the
bridges (Fig. 9–27b) is shown in Fig. 9–27d, in which only the connections at 
the upper bridge are shown. The lower rod exerts a force of mg downward on
the lower of the two pins because it supports the lower bridge. The upper rod
exerts a force of 2mg on the upper pin (labelled A) because the upper rod supports
both bridges. Thus we see that when the builders substituted two shorter rods
for each single long one, the stress in the supporting pin A was doubled. What
perhaps seemed like a simple substitution did, in fact, lead to a tragic collapse in
1981 with a loss of life of over 100 people (see
