ice (D) is incorrect because it shows
tryptophan bound to the operator, but tryptophan cannot bind to the operator on its own.
57. (A) In inducible operons, the repressor protein can bind to the operator on its own, shutting down the operon.
Inducible operons usually produce enzymes that are involved in digesting a compound. The inducer molecule is
often the compound that is digested by the products of the inducible operon. When the inducer molecule is
present, the inducer binds to the repressor and the repressor undergoes a shape change, which causes it to be
released from the operator. RNA polymerase can then begin transcription of the operon. Choice (B) is incorrect
because lactose is present but is not bound to the repressor protein (and the repressor is bound to the operator).
In choice (C), lactose is bound to the repressor but the repressor is still bound to the operator, so this choice is
incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because it shows lactose bound to the operator, but onl
