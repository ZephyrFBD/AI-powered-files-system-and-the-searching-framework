Objective
2.20 The student is able to justify that positive feedback mechanisms amplify responses in
organisms.
Animal organs and organ systems constantly adjust to internal and external changes through a process called homeostasis
(“steady state”). These changes might be in the level of glucose or calcium in blood or in external temperatures.
Homeostasis means to maintain dynamic equilibrium in the body. It is dynamic because it is constantly adjusting to the
changes that the body’s systems encounter. It is equilibrium because body functions are kept within specific ranges. Even
an animal that is apparently inactive is maintaining this homeostatic equilibrium.
Homeostatic Process
The goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a point or value called a set point. While there are normal
fluctuations from the set point, the body’s systems will usually attempt to go back to this point. A change in the internal or
external env
