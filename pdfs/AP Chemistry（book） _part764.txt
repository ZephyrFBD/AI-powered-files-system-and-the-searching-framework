ctants and products are in their standard states. 
We denote a standard enthalpy change as ∆H °, where the superscript ° indicates stan-
dard-state conditions.
The standard enthalpy of formation of a compound, ∆Hf°, is the change in 
enthalpy for the reaction that forms one mole of the compound from its elements with 
all substances in their standard states:

[5.24]
We usually report ∆Hf° values at 298 K. If an element exists in more than one form under 
standard conditions, the most stable form of the element is usually used for the formation 
reaction. For example, the standard enthalpy of formation for ethanol, C2H5OH, is the 
enthalpy change for the reaction
 
2 C1graphite2 + 3 H21g2 + 1
2  O21g2 ¡  C2H5OH1l2   ∆Hf° = -277.7 kJ 
[5.25]
The elemental source of oxygen is O2, not O or O3, because O2 is the stable form of oxygen 
at 298 K and atmospheric pressure. Similarly, the elemental source of carbon is graphite 
and not diamond becau
