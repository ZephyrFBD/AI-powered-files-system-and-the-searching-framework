6–7 Problem Solving Using 
Conservation of Mechanical Energy
A simple example of the conservation of mechanical energy (neglecting air resis-
tance) is a rock allowed to fall due to Earth’s gravity from a height h above the
ground, as shown in Fig. 6–17. If the rock starts from rest, all of the initial energy
is potential energy. As the rock falls, the potential energy mgy decreases (because
the rock’s height above the ground y decreases), but the rock’s kinetic energy
increases to compensate, so that the sum of the two remains constant. At any point
along the path, the total mechanical energy is given by
where v is its speed at that point. If we let the subscript 1 represent the rock at one
point along its path (for example, the initial point), and the subscript 2 represent
