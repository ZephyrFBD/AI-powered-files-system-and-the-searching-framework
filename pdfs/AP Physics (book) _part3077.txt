a blackbody at high temperature.
Einstein proposed that for some experiments, light could
be pictured as being emitted and absorbed as quanta (particles),
which we now call photons, each with energy
(27;4)
and momentum
(27;6)
He proposed the photoelectric effect as a test for the photon
theory of light. In the photoelectric effect, the photon theory
says that each incident photon can strike an electron in a
material and eject it if the photon has sufficient energy. The
maximum energy of ejected electrons is then linearly related to
the frequency of the incident light.
The photon theory is also supported by the Compton
effect and the observation of electronâ€“positron pair production.
The wave;particle duality refers to the idea that light and
matter (such as electrons) have both wave and particle proper-
ties. The wavelength of an object is given by
