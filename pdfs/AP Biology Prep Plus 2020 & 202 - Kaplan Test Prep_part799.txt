If a parasite is resistant to a host’s nonspecific immune system, then
stimulating an immune response can aid the parasite by eliminating
competing parasites. (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because
stimulating the immune system will not make the host significantly
more vulnerable to infection, even though it does require energy. (C) is
incorrect because this stimulation does, in fact, present an indirect
advantage to the parasite by allowing it to outcompete parasites that
are vulnerable to the host’s nonspecific immune system. (D) is
incorrect because stimulation of the nonspecific immune system
usually leads to an inflammatory response, which will not increase the
amount of nutrients at the site of inflammation.
