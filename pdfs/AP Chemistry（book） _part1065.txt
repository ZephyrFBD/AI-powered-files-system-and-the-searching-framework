ectrons 
in an atom the value of S is usually close to the number of core electrons in the atom. (Electrons 
in the same valence shell do not screen one another very effectively, but they do affect the 
value of S slightly; see “A Closer Look: Effective Nuclear Charge.”)
To understand better the notion of effective nuclear charge, we can use an analogy of a 
light bulb with a frosted glass shade (Figure 7.2). The light bulb represents the nucleus, and 
the observer is the electron of interest, which is usually a valence electron. The amount of 
light that the electron “sees” is analogous to the amount of net nuclear attraction experi-
enced by the electron. The other electrons in the atom, especially the core electrons, act 
like a frosted glass lampshade, decreasing the amount of light that gets to the observer. If 
the light bulb gets brighter while the lampshade stays the same (Z increases), more light is 
observed. Likewise, if the lampshade gets thicker (S increases), less light i
