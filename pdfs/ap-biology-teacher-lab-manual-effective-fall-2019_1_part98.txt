 use a different database? Is the database 
well curated and annotated? These are all questions that are relevant to BLAST analysis, 
or any study involving a public database. 
One biologically important example that illustrates some of the quantitative issues 
in constructing meaningful patterns from complex data sets is evolutionary tree 
construction from nucleic acid or protein sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of human 
mitochondrial DNA has allowed us to construct a history of human migration from 
Africa, to track down the origins of AIDS, and to produce more effective flu vaccines. 
Phylogenetic analysis is a particularly good mathematical tool to make sense of 
enormous data sets. Working through this type of analysis allows students to evaluate 
how the different biological assumptions of mutation rate, adaptation, conservation of 
characters, parallelism, and convergence affect our construction and interpretation of 
ancestry, or of any organism. 
Do we construct phylogenetic
