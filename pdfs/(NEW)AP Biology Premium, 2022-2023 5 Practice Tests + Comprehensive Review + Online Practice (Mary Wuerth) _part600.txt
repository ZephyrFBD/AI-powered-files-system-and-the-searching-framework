 is shared by all living organisms, and it is a powerful piece of evidence for the common ancestry
of all forms of life on Earth. The genetic code is also redundant, meaning multiple codons can code for the same
amino acids during translation. Because of the redundancy of the genetic code, individuals may have the same
proteins with the same amino acid sequences but with different DNA sequences. Restriction enzymes cut DNA at
specific DNA sequences. As the restriction enzyme cuts DNA, differences in DNA sequences result in differently
sized fragments of DNA from different individuals. These DNA fragments of different sizes can be separated by gel
electrophoresis.
In this lab, a scenario might involve a description of a crime scene and suspects. DNA from evidence at the crime
scene is isolated and cut with restriction enzymes. DNA is isolated from the suspects and cut with the same
restriction enzymes. The resulting DNA fragments are placed on an agarose gel and are separated by gel
ele
