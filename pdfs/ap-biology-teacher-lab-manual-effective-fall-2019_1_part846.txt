Figure A.21 
As we have drawn it, the curve indicates that the rate at 29째 and at 31째 would be slightly 
lower than at 30째, and this may not be true. In order to determine the true shape of 
the curve in the region of the maximum rate we would have to make progress curves 
at smaller temperature intervals, say, every two degrees. However, it is extremely 
unlikely that the true shape of the curve is anything like the two possibilities shown on 
the diagrams in Figure A.22. All our experience tells us that if a reaction depends on 
temperature, then that dependence will be a smooth curve, without sharp bends. In 
fact, if in an experiment we should observe behavior of the type shown in Figure A.22, 
we would immediately begin to suspect that something is wrong with our thermostat! 
Thus, although it may be that the shape of the rate-temperature curve for Process I is 
somewhat different from the way we drew it in Figure A.21, we can
