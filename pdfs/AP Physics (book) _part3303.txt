CHAPTER 29
Molecules and Solids
Quantum mechanics explains the bonding together of atoms to
form molecules. In a covalent bond, the atoms share electrons.
The electron clouds of two or more atoms overlap because of
constructive interference between the electron waves. The
positive nuclei are attracted to this concentration of negative
charge between them, forming the bond.
An ionic bond is an extreme case of a covalent bond in
which one or more electrons from one atom spend much more
time around the other atom than around their own. The atoms
then act as oppositely charged ions that attract each other,
forming the bond.
These strong bonds hold molecules together, and also hold
atoms and molecules together in solids. Also important are
weak bonds (or van der Waals bonds), which are generally dipole
attractions between molecules.
When atoms combine to form molecules, the
