 
mass 8â€“12 4th instar larvae as a group and then determine the mean mass per individual 
larva. They should transfer all the larvae into the prepared Brassica Barn with the single 
brussels sprout cut in half. 
Step 3 Students create a table in their lab notebooks to help organize the data collected, 
including estimates of the energy/biomass flow from plants to butterfly larvae (see Table 
3). They collect, dry, and mass the frass (fecal material) produced by the larvae over the 
next three days. After three days of feeding, they mass the larvae as a group and then 
determine the mean mass per individual and the mean mass gained per day. Finally, 
students mass the remaining part of the brussels sprout and determine the amount of 
brussels sprout biomass consumed by each larva per day.
