mosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to decondense (unravel),
relaxing into a chromatin configuration. The mitotic spindles are depolymerized into tubulin monomers that will be
used to assemble cytoskeletal components for each daughter cell. Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes, and
nucleosomes appear within the nuclear area.
Cytokinesis
Cytokinesis, or “cell motion,” is the second main stage of the mitotic phase, during which cell division is completed via
the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells. Division is not complete until the cell
components have been apportioned and completely separated into the two daughter cells. Although the stages of mitosis are
similar for most eukaryotes, the process of cytokinesis is quite different for eukaryotes that have cell walls, such as plant
cells.
In cells such as animal cells that lack cell walls, cytokinesis starts during late anaphase. A contractile ring composed of actin
filaments forms jus
