 two-component model used to determine percent body
fat in a human body assumes that a fraction 
of the
body’s total mass m is composed of fat with a density of
and that the remaining mass of the body is
composed of fat-free tissue with a density of 
If the specific gravity of the entire body’s density is X,
show that the percent body fat
is given by
37. (II) On dry land, an athlete weighs 70.2 kg. The same
athlete, when submerged in a swimming pool and hanging
from a scale, has an “apparent weight” of 3.4 kg. Using
Example 10–8 as a guide, (a) find the total volume V of the
submerged athlete. (b) Assume that when submerged, the
athlete’s body contains a residual volume
of air (mainly in the lungs). Taking 
to be the 
actual volume of the athlete’s body, find the body’s specific
gravity, SG. (c) What is the athlete’s percent body fat
assuming it is given by the formula
?
38. (II) How many helium-filled balloons would it take to lift 
a person? Assume the person has a mass of 72 kg and
