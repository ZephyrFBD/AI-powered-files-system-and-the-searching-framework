ION (a) From Eq. 25–3 we find
(b) For a relaxed eye, the image 
is at the focal point of both the eyepiece and the
objective lenses. The distance between the two lenses is thus
which is essentially the length of the telescope.

FIGURE 25–20 Astronomical
telescope (refracting). Parallel light from
one point on a distant object 
is brought to a focus by the objective
lens in its focal plane. This image 
is
magnified by the eyepiece to form the
final image 
Only two of the rays
shown entering the objective are
standard rays (2 and 3) as described in
Fig. 23–37.
