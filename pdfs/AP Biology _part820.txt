Notice that species A–D all have a C in location 1 on the DNA, while
species E has a mutation in that location.
Objective
In this lab, students will use BLAST to compare several genes and then
use the information to construct a cladogram. A cladogram (or
phylogenetic tree) is a visualization of the evolutionary relatedness of
species. See Chapter 10 of this book for more information about
cladograms. Figure 19.5 is a simple cladogram.

LAB #4: DIFFUSION AND OSMOSIS
Introduction
Water potential (Ψ)
Is measured in units of pressure called megapascals (MPa)
Measures the relative tendency for water to move from one place to
