quality preserves are considered. For example, high quality preserves include only about 50 percent of threatened
amphibian species. The conclusion must be that either the percentage of area protected must increase, or the percentage
of high quality preserves must increase, or preserves must be targeted with greater attention to biodiversity protection.
Researchers argue that more attention to the latter solution is required.
Preserve Design
There has been extensive research into optimal preserve designs for maintaining biodiversity. The fundamental principle
behind much of the research has been the seminal theoretical work of Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson
published in 1967 on island biogeography.
[5] This work sought to understand the factors affecting biodiversity on islands.
The fundamental conclusion was that biodiversity on an island was a function of the origin of species through migration,
speciation, and extinction on that island. Islands farther from a mainland are
