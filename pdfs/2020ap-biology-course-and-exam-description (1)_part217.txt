SYI-3.D.1
The level of variation in a population affects 
population dynamics—
a.	 Population ability to respond to changes in the 
environment is influenced by genetic diversity. 
Species and populations with little genetic 
diversity are at risk of decline or extinction. 
b.	Genetically diverse populations are more 
resilient to environmental perturbation 
because they are more likely to contain 
individuals who can withstand the 
environmental pressure.
c.	 Alleles that are adaptive in one environmental 
condition may be deleterious in another 
because of different selective pressures.
