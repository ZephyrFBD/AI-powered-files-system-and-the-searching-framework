the correct blinking pattern, no mating occurs. The two animals
become isolated from each other.
Temporal isolation: Temporal refers to time. A flowering plant
colonizes a region with areas that are warm and sunny and areas
that are cool and shady. Flowers in the regions that are warmer
become sexually mature sooner than flowers in the cooler areas.
This separates flowers in the two different environments into two
separate populations.
Reproductive isolation: Closely related species may be unable to
mate because of a variety of reasons. Differences in the structure of
genitalia may prevent insemination. Differences in flower shape
may prevent pollination. Things that prevent mating are called
prezygotic barriers. For example, a small male dog and a large

female dog cannot mate because of the enormous size differences
between the two animals. Things that prevent the production of
fertile offspring, once mating has occurred, are called pos
