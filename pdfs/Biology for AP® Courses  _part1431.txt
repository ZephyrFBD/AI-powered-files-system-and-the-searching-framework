Mendelâ€™s Mapped Traits
Homologous recombination is a common genetic process, yet Mendel never observed it. Had he investigated both linked
and unlinked genes, it would have been much more difficult for him to create a unified model of his data on the basis
of probabilistic calculations. Researchers who have since mapped the seven traits investigated by Mendel onto the seven
chromosomes of the pea plant genome have confirmed that all of the genes he examined are either on separate chromosomes
or are sufficiently far apart as to be statistically unlinked. Some have suggested that Mendel was enormously lucky to select
only unlinked genes, whereas others question whether Mendel discarded any data suggesting linkage. In any case, Mendel
consistently observed independent assortment because he examined genes that were effectively unlinked.
