ells are successfully 
transformed. 
(C) The bacteria on plate III did not mutate. 
(D) The plasmid inhibits E. coli growth.

45. Experimental evidence shows that the process  
of glycolysis is present and virtually identical  
in organisms from all three domains, Archaea, 
Bacteria, and Eukarya. Which of the following 
hypotheses could be best supported by this 
evidence? 
(A) All organisms carry out glycolysis in 
mitochondria. 
(B) Glycolysis is a universal energy-releasing 
process and therefore suggests a common 
ancestor for all forms of life. 
(C) Across the three domains, all organisms 
depend solely on the process of anaerobic 
respiration for ATP productio
