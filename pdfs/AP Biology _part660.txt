sorb more sodium ions and water, thus increasing blood
volume and pressure. ADH, also known as vasopressin, is produced by
the hypothalamus and is both stored in and released from the posterior
pituitary. It is released in response to dehydration due to excessive
sweating or inadequate water intake, which causes the blood to become too
concentrated (osmolarity to increase). ADH increases the permeability of
the collecting tubules to water by opening renal aquaporins
(transmembrane proteins that function as water channels). This opening
allows more water to be reabsorbed and urine volume to be reduced.
Renin, a hormone released from the kidneys, converts an inactive protein
into active angiotensin, which stimulates the adrenal cortex to release
aldosterone.
Physicians prescribe several effective drugs to treat excessively high
blood pressure. The most common drug prescribed for high blood pressure
is a diuretic, commonly called a water pill, which reduces blood volume
by increasing the
