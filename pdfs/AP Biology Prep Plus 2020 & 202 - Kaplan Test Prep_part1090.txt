18. Many G-protein-coupled receptors use the second messenger cyclic AMP
(cAMP). The binding of adenylyl cyclase to the Gs α subunit activates
adenylyl cyclase and then generates cAMP. The most well-known eﬀector
of cAMP in the cell is protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates
proteins at the PKA phosphorylation site. cAMP binds to two sites on each
of PKA’s two regulatory subunits, which causes the dissociation of PKA’s
two catalytic subunits. PKA can activate phosphodiesterase, which
degrades cAMP.
Which of the following is expected to directly increase cAMP levels in the
cytoplasm?
Blocking the PKA phosphorylation site on cAMP.
(A)
Inhibiting phosphoryl
