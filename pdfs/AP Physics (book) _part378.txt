hat friction can be neglected.
APPROACH We follow the Problem Solving Strategy on the previous page.
SOLUTION
1. Draw a sketch: The situation is shown in Fig. 4–21a; it shows the box and the
force applied by the person,
2. Free-body diagram: Figure 4–21b shows the free-body diagram of the box. To
draw it correctly, we show all the forces acting on the box and only the forces
acting on the box. They are: the force of gravity 
the normal force exerted by
the table 
and the force exerted by the person 
We are interested only in
translational motion, so we can show the three forces acting at a point, Fig.4–21c.
3. Choose axes and resolve vectors: We expect the motion to be horizontal, so
we choose the x axis horizontal and the y axis vertical. The pull of 40.0 N has
components
In the horizontal (x) direction,
and 
have zero components. Thus the
horizontal component of the net force is 
4. (a) Apply Newton’s second law to get the x component of the acceleration:
