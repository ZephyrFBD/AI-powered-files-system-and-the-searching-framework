Electron volt
On the other hand, if a particle with a charge equal to twice the magnitude of the
charge on the electron 
moves through a potential differ-
ence of 1000 V, its kinetic energy will increase by
Although the electron volt is handy for stating the energies of molecules and
elementary particles, it is not a proper SI unit. For calculations, electron volts should
be converted to joules using the conversion factor just given. In Example 17–2, for
example, the electron acquired a kinetic energy of 
We can quote
this energy as 5000 eV
but when determining
the speed of a particle in SI units, we must use the KE in joules (J).
