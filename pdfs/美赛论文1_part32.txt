 main uncertain factors. 
 Some uncertain factors are positive while others are negative. We set their indexes 
as the dispersion index which only contains zero and one. 
 The possibility of the occurrence of the uncertain factor is influenced by the 
potential possibility and the effect of the index of the main factor in the first 
criteria layer that the uncertain factor belongs to. Usually we consider the effect to 
be linear. 
 The weight of the uncertain factor is influenced by the original weight and the 
effect from the rest main factor. Usually we consider the effect to be linear.
