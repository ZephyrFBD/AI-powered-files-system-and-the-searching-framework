or tissue and organ formation during early development, and which later plays a role in the “self” versus “non-self”
distinction of the immune response.
Among the most sophisticated functions of the plasma membrane is the ability to transmit signals by means of complex,
integral proteins known as receptors. These proteins act both as receivers of extracellular inputs and as activators of
intracellular processes. These membrane receptors provide extracellular attachment sites for effectors like hormones and
growth factors, and they activate intracellular response cascades when their effectors are bound. Occasionally, receptors
are hijacked by viruses that use them to gain entry into cells, and at times, the genes encoding receptors become mutated,
causing the process of signal transduction to malfunction with disastrous consequences.

The existence of the plasma membrane was identified in the 1890s, and its chemical components were identified in
1915. The principal com
