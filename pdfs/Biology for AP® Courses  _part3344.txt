testes, blood cells, and spleen. They
are transported across the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to receptors on the mitochondria resulting in increased
ATP production. In the nucleus, T3 and T4 activate genes involved in energy production and glucose oxidation. This results
in increased rates of metabolism and body heat production, which is known as the hormoneâ€™s calorigenic effect.
T3 and T4 release from the thyroid gland is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the
anterior pituitary. TSH binding at the receptors of the follicle of the thyroid triggers the production of T3 and T4 from a
glycoprotein called thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is present in the follicles of the thyroid, and is converted into thyroid
hormones with the addition of iodine. Iodine is formed from iodide ions that are actively transported into the thyroid follicle
from the bloodstream. A peroxidase enzyme then attaches the iodine to the tyrosine amino acid found in thyroglo
