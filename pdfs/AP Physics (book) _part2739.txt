le-slit experiment it is found that blue light of
wavelength 480 nm gives a second-order maximum at a
certain location on the screen. What wavelength of visible
light would have a minimum at the same location?
13. (II) Two narrow slits separated by 1.0 mm are illuminated
by 544-nm light. Find the distance between adjacent bright
fringes on a screen 4.0 m from the slits.
14. (II) Assume that light of a single color, rather than white
light, passes through the two-slit setup described in 
Example 24–3. If the distance from the central fringe to
a first-order fringe is measured to be 2.9 mm on the screen,
determine the light’s wavelength (in nm) and color (see
Fig. 24–12).
15. (II) In a double-slit experiment, the third-order maximum
for light of wavelength 480 nm is located 16 mm from the
central bright spot on a screen 1.6 m from the slits. Light of
wavelength 650 nm is then projected through the same
slits. How far from the central bright spot will the second-
order maximum of this lig
