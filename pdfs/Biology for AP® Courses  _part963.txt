 infinitely. Substances change form or move from one type of molecule to another, but their constituent atoms never
disappear. (Figure 1.21 is an illustrative example of this process.)
CO2 is no more a form of waste than oxygen is wasteful to photosynthesis. Both are byproducts of reactions that move
on to other reactions. Photosynthesis absorbs light energy to build carbohydrates in chloroplasts, and aerobic cellular
respiration releases energy by using oxygen to metabolize carbohydrates in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Both processes
use electron transport chains to capture the energy necessary to drive other reactions. These two powerhouse processes,
photosynthesis and cellular respiration, function in biological, cyclical harmony to allow organisms to access life-sustaining
energy that originates millions of miles away in a burning star humans call the sun.
