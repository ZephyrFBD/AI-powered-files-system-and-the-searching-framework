tosynthesis will increase as the level of oxygen increases.
The Two Parts of Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light independent-reactions. In
the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored
chemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions
drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. Therefore, although the light-independent reactions do not use
light as a reactant, they require the products of the light-dependent reactions to function. In addition, several enzymes of
the light-independent reactions are activated by light. The light-dependent reactions utilize certain molecules to temporarily
store the energy: These are referred to as energy carriers. The energy carriers that move energy from light-dependent
reactions to light-independent reactions can be thou
