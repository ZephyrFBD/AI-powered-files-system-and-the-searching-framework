Required Course Content 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-2.C
Explain how the structure 
of biological membranes 
influences selective 
permeability.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-2.C.1
The structure of cell membranes results in 
selective permeability.
ENE-2.C.2
Cell membranes separate the internal environment 
of the cell from the external environment.
ENE-2.C.3
Selective permeability is a direct consequence 
of membrane structure, as described by the 
fluid mosaic model.
ENE-2.C.4
Small nonpolar molecules, including N2, O2, and 
CO2, freely pass across the membrane. Hydrophilic 
substances, such as large polar molecules and
