genetic engineering, the results may be observable in the organism. These changes may 
be advantageous for the long-term survival and evolution of a species, but it also may be 
disadvantageous to the individuals who possess the different genetic information. 
In bacteria, genetic variation does not happen by mutation alone. It also can be 
introduced through the lateral (horizontal) transfer of genetic material between cells. 
Some bacteria undergo conjugation, which is direct cell-to-cell transfer. Other bacteria 
acquire DNA by transduction (viral transmission of genetic information). The third 
route is transformation, which is uptake of “naked” DNA from the environment outside 
the cell. 
 
(You may have previously studied transformation in a different context. In an 
experiment conducted in 1928, Frederick Griffith, seeking a vaccine against a virulent 
strain of pneumonia, suggested that bacteria are capable of transferring genetic 
information through transformation. Little did
