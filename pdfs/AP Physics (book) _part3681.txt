its Kelvin temperature T; that is,
The surface temperatures of stars typically range from
about 3000 K (reddish) to about 50,000 K (UV).
Determining star temperature and star size. Suppose
that the distances from Earth to two nearby stars can be reasonably estimated, and
that their measured apparent brightnesses suggest the two stars have about the
same luminosity, L. The spectrum of one of the stars peaks at about 700 nm (so
it is reddish). The spectrum of the other peaks at about 350 nm (bluish). Use
Wien’s law (Eq. 27–2) and the Stefan-Boltzmann equation (Section 14–8) to
determine (a) the surface temperature of each star, and (b) how much larger one
star is than the other.
APPROACH We determine the surface temperature T for each star using Wien’s
law and each star’s peak wavelength. Then, using the Stefan-Boltzmann equation
(power output or luminosity
), we can
find the surface area ratio and relative sizes of the two stars.
SOLUTION (a) Wien’s law (Eq. 27–2) states that
So
