the amino group (NH2).

B
Unlike eukaryotes, prokaryotes (which include bacteria) do not contain membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria
contain circular double-stranded DNA, ribosomes, and a cell wall, so (A) and (D) are incorrect. Also eliminate
(C) because bacterial cell membranes are made up of a bilipid layer with proteins interspersed.

D
Populations can be described as the evolutionary unit because changes in the genetic makeup of populations
can be measured over time. Eliminate (A), as genetic changes occur only at the individual level. Only under
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium does the gene pool remain fixed over time in a population. However, this
statement does not explain why the population is the evolving unit, so (B) is incorrect. Choice (C) is true but
does not address the question.

A
Positive feedback occurs when a stimulus causes an increased response. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are
examples of negative feedback.
