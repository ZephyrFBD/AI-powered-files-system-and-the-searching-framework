ave a defined number of water molecules in the 
crystal lattice are known as hydrates. When NaCl(s) is dissolved in water, on the other 
hand, no chemical reaction occurs. If the solution is evaporated to dryness, NaCl is 
recovered. Our focus throughout this chapter is on solutions from which the solute can 
be recovered unchanged from the solution.
13.2 ∣ Saturated Solutions and Solubility
As a solid solute begins to dissolve in a solvent, the concentration of solute particles in 
solution increases, increasing the chances that some solute particles will collide with the 
surface of the solid and reattach. This process, which is the opposite of the solution pro-
cess, is called crystallization. Thus, two opposing processes occur in a solution in con-
tact with undissolved solute. This situation is represented in this chemical equation:
 
Solute + solvent ∆

When the rates of these opposing processes become equal, a dynamic equilibrium is estab-
