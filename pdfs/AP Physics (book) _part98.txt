Volume of a lake. Estimate how much water
there is in a particular lake, Fig. 1–10a, which is roughly circular, about 1 km
across, and you guess it has an average depth of about 10 m.
APPROACH No lake is a perfect circle, nor can lakes be expected to have a
perfectly flat bottom. We are only estimating here. To estimate the volume,
we can use a simple model of the lake as a cylinder: we multiply the average
depth of the lake times its roughly circular surface area, as if the lake were a
cylinder (Fig. 1–10b).
SOLUTION The volume V of a cylinder is the product of its height h times
the area of its base:
where r is the radius of the circular base.† The
radius r is
so the volume is approximately
where 
was rounded off to 3. So the volume is on the order of 
ten million cubic meters. Because of all the estimates that went into this
calculation, the order-of-magnitude estimate 
is probably better to
quote than the 
figure.
