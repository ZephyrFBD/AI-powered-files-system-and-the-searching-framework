lanation for the introduction of h. The recognition that this was an important
and radical innovation did not come until later, after about 1905 when others,
particularly Einstein, entered the field.
The quantum hypothesis, Eq. 27–3, states that the energy of an oscillator 
can be
or 2hf, or 3hf, and so on, but there cannot be vibrations with 
energies between these values. That is, energy would not be a continuous quan-
tity as had been believed for centuries; rather it is quantized—it exists only 
in discrete amounts. The smallest amount of energy possible (hf) is called the
quantum of energy. Recall from Chapter 11 that the energy of an oscillation is
proportional to the amplitude squared. Another way of expressing the quantum
hypothesis is that not just any amplitude of vibration is possible. The possible
values for the amplitude are related to the frequency f.
A simple analogy may help. Compare a ramp, on which a box can be placed
at any height, to a flight of stairs on which the
