39. How are the formation of urea and uric acid similar
and different?
a.
In birds, reptiles, and insects, the urea cycle
converts ammonia to urea. In mammals, the uric
acid cycle converts ammonia to uric acid.
Formation of urea from ammonia requires less
energy and is less complex than uric acid
formation.
b.
In mammals, the urea cycle converts ammonia to
urea. In birds, reptiles, and insects, the uric acid
cycle converts ammonia to uric acid. Formation
of urea from ammonia requires more energy and
is less complex than uric acid formation.
c.
In mammals, the urea cycle converts ammonia to
urea. In birds, reptiles, and insects, the uric acid
cycle converts ammonia to uric acid. Formation
of urea from ammonia requires less energy and
is more complex than uric acid formation.
d.
In mammals, the urea cycle converts ammonia to
urea. In birds, reptiles, and insects, the uric acid
cycle converts ammonia to uric acid. Formation
of urea from ammonia requires les
