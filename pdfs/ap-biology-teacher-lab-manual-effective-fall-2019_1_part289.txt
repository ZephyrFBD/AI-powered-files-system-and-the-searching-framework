 bursting as water enters; 
however, pressure builds up inside the cell and affects the rate of osmosis. 
Water potential predicts which way water diffuses through plant tissues and is 
abbreviated by the Greek letter psi (ψ). Water potential is the free energy per mole of 
water and is calculated from two major components: (1) the solute potential (ψS), which
is dependent on solute concentration, and (2) the pressure potential (
 
ψP), which results 
from the exertion of pressure — either positive or negative (tension) — on a solution. 
The solute potential is also called the osmotic potential. 
ψ = ψP + ψS 
Water Potential = Pressure Potential + Solute Potential 
Water moves from an area of higher water potential or higher free energy to an area of 
lower water potential or lower free energy. Water potential measures the tendency of 
water to diffuse from one compartment to another compartment. 
The water potential of pure water in an open beaker is zero (ψ = 0) because both the
