b) Hydrogen bonding (in ethanol and other liquids) leads to 
more ordering in the liquid state and a greater than usual increase 
in entropy upon vaporization. Liquids that experience hydrogen 
bonding are probably exceptions to Trouton’s rule. (c) Owing 
to strong hydrogen bonding interactions, water probably does 
not obey Trouton’s rule. ∆S°

condition of equal moles of the two gases can be achieved at some 
temperature. For individual gas pressures of 1 atm and a total pres-
sure of 2 atm, the mixture is at equilibrium at 328.5 K or 55.5 °C.

20.1 In this analogy, the electron is analogous to the proton 1H+2. 
Redox reactions can be viewed as electron-transfer reactions, just 
“driving force” for the expansion of the gas is the increase in entropy.

states for a
