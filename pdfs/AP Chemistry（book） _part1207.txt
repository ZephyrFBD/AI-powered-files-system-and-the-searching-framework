affected by water. Stable in 
air. Melting point: 153 °C. Density: 7.3 g>cm3. Electrical con-
ductivity: 20% that of copper. Hardness: About 1% as hard as 
iron. When 4.20 g of the unknown is heated in an excess of 
oxygen, 5.08 g of a white solid is formed. The solid could be 
sublimed by heating to over 800 °C.” (a) Using information 
in the text and the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 
and making allowances for possible variations in numbers 
from current values, identify the element reported. (b) Write 
a balanced chemical equation for the reaction with oxygen. 
(c) Judging from Figure 7.1, might this nineteenth-century 
investigator have been the ﬁrst to discover a new element?
 7.107  In April 2010, a research team reported that it had made Ele-
ment 117. This discovery was conﬁrmed in 2012 by additional 
experiments. Write the ground-state electron conﬁguration 
for Element 117 and estimate values for its ﬁrst ionization en-
ergy, electron affinity, atomic size, and commo
