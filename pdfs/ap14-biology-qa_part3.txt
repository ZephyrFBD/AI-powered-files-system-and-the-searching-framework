to predict a measurable 
experimental result supporting the original hypothesis. 
How well did students perform on this question? 
The mean score for this question was 3.37 out of a possible 10 points. 
What were common student errors or omissions?  
In part (a), most students were able to correctly label, scale, and orient the graph. Student responses 
included bar graphs, modified bar graphs, scatter plots, and line graphs. Of the students who constructed 
a bar graph, very few correctly graphed the 95% confidence intervals (sample mean ± 2xSEM). The 
majority of students who attempted to include some type of confidence interval only included the sample 
mean ± 1xSEM). 
In part (b), very few students used the non-overlapping confidence intervals of Samples I and III to justify 
the claim that population I and population III were the most likely populations to be statistically different.
