rewrite a complicated-looking expression as a much simpler one. 
To simplify algebraic expressions, we used factoring, common denominators, and the 
Special Product Formulas. 
To simplify trigonometric expressions, we use these same techniques together with the 
fundamental trigonometric identities.

3.7.3 Proving Trigonometric Identities 
 
To verify that a trigonometric equation is an identity, we transform one side of the equation 
into the other side by a series of steps, each of which is itself an identity. 
GUIDELINES FOR PROVING TRIGONOMETRIC IDENTITIES 
1. Start with one side. Pick one side of the equation, and write it down. Your goal is to 
transform it into the other side. Itâ€™s usually easier to start with the more complicated side. 
2. Use known identities. Use algebra and the identities you know to change the side you 
started with. Bring fractional expressions to a common denominator, factor,
