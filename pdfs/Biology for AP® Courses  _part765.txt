 enzyme induces a change in the substrate,
but is not changed itself during the reaction.
c.
The substrates attach to the enzyme and the
chemical reaction proceeds.
d.
The enzyme changes shape to fit the substrate
causing the transition state to occur.
56. Enzyme inhibitors play an important part in the control
of enzyme functions, allowing them to continue, or
inhibiting them for a period of time. Which inhibitor
affects the initial rate but do not affect the maximal rate?
a.
allosteric
b.

c.
non-competitive

SCIENCE PRACTICE CHALLENGE QUESTIONS
57. Activation energy is required for a reaction to proceed,
and it is lower if the reaction is catalyzed. Sucrose (table
sugar) is a disaccharide. When we eat sucrose it is
converted to carbon dioxide and water, as with other
carbohydrates.
1.
Identify if the breakdown of sucrose is
endergonic or exergonic. Explain the reasoning
for your identification.
2.
Based on your identification, explain if cubes of
sugar can
