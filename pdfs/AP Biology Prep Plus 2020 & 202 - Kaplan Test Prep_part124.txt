he following hypotheses would provide the strongest
justification for the scientists’ observations?
The heart muscle uses a large supply of ATP because it
contracts and relaxes continuously.
(A)
Skeletal muscle needs a large amount of mitochondria to
support protein synthesis.
(B)
The liver does not need mitochondria to function.
(C)
The relative amount of mitochondria in each tissue does not
have physiological significance.
(D)
3. Saturated fats have a high melting point and remain solid at room
temperature. Unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and
solidify at much lower temperatures than saturated fats. In order
for the membrane to function properly, membrane fluidity must
stay within a certain physiological range. Chemical analysis of
membrane lipids in bacteria adapted to diﬀerent temperature
ranges is shown in the table below.
