sts of a 3′ → 5′
template strand and a 5′ → 3′ template strand. The enzyme that assembles the new DNA strand, DNA polymerase,
moves in the 3′ → 5′ direction along each template strand. A new (complement) strand grows in the antiparallel, 5′
→ 3′ direction.
For the 3′ → 5′ template strand, replication occurs continuously as the DNA polymerase follows the replication fork,
assembling a 5′ → 3′ complementary strand. This complementary strand is called the leading strand.
For the 5′ → 3′ template strand, however, the DNA polymerase moves away from the uncoiling replication fork.
This is because it can assemble nucleotides only as it travels in the 3′ → 5′ direction. As the helix is uncoiled, DNA
polymerase assembles short segments of nucleotides along the template strand in the direction away from the
replication fork. After each complement segment is assembled, the DNA polymerase must return back to the
replication fork to begin assembling the next segment. These short segments of complem
