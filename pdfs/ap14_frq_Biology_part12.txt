shows the finger in a retracted and flexed position. The bottom illustration is labeled Response, and the needle is no longer touching the finger. There is an unlabeled arrow pointing from the top illustration of the finger to the bottom illustration of the finger. Below these two illustrations is a third illustration showing a cross section of a spinal cord. This illustration is labeled Spinal Cord. Connecting all three illustrations are lines that represent nerve fibers. Starting in the tip of the finger in the top illustration, multiple nerve fibers in the finger tip are shown combining into a single nerve fiber that extends out of the finger, down and counterclockwise, and ending in the spinal cord. Positioned over this line is an arrow pointing away from the top illustration of the finger and toward the spinal cord. This arrow is labeled Signal Direction. Inside the spinal cord, the nerve fiber makes a connection with another nerve fiber, which in turn makes a connection with a th
