 This concentration of substrate where all of the enzyme in a
reaction is bound by substrate is called the saturation point. Additional substrate past this point will no longer
increase the speed of the reaction.
Enzyme Regulation
We know that enzymes control the rates of chemical reactions. But what regulates the activity of enzymes? It turns
out that a cell can control enzymatic activity by regulating the conditions that influence the shape of the enzyme.
Enzymes can be turned on or off by things that bind to them. Sometimes these things can bind at the active site, and
sometimes they bind at other sites, called allosteric sites.
If the substance has a shape that fits the active site of an enzyme (i.e., similar to the substrate or the transition state),
it can compete with the substrate and block the substrate from getting into the active site. This is called competitive
inhibition. If there was enough substrate available, the substrate would out-compete the inhibitor and the reactio
