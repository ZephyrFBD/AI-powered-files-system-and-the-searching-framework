, and the citric acid cycle interrelate with protein and lipid
metabolism pathways?
Connection for AP速 Courses
The breakdown and synthesis of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids connect with the metabolic pathways of
glycolysis and the citric acid cycle but enter the pathways at different points. Thus, these macromolecules can be used as
sources of free energy.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined
in Big Idea 2 of the AP速 Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table. The Learning Objectives listed in
the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory
experience, instructional activities, and AP速 exam questions. A Learning Objective merges required content with one or
more of the seven Science Practices.
