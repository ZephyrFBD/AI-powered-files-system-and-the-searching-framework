The gene distribution never changes and pk=pk-1.
The equations of the Hardy-Weinberg model were
modified (Haldane, 1924) to create a model in which
evolution occurs:
(2)
Fk(AA) = p2
k wAA/ W Fk(Aa) = 2pk qk wAa/ W Fk =
q2
k waa/ W W = p2 wAA + 2pqwAa/ q2 waa
Haldane divides by the factor W=Fk(AA)+Fk(Aa)+Fk(aa)
so that the probabilities that are still calculated with
equation (1) to continue to satisfy the condition for p and q
to represent probabilities: (p+q)2=1.
A. Justify Haldaneâ€™s model in terms of what the factors
wAA, wAa, and waa mean.
B. Suppose that wAA = wAa = 1, but that waa = 0.8. Predict
what will happen to the population over time.
Fitness is determined by the environment. Moree (The
American Naturalist, 86, 1952) measured the relative
fitness in Drosophila melanogaster of a recessive allele
that imparts black eye color as population density
increases. A varying number of flies with an equal number
of males and females were placed in a pint jar and progeny
counted. In
