hylakoid. Protons (H+) also enter the
 
thylakoid from the stroma when they follow electrons along the electron transport chain in the thylakoid membrane.
Also, proton concentration
 
decreases outside the thylakoid (in the stroma) when NADP+ and H+
 
combine with the electrons from the electron transport chain in the thylakoid membrane. The effect of all processes
is to increase proton
 
(H+) concentration inside the thylakoid and decrease H+ outside the
 
thylakoid (in the stroma of the chloroplast).
 
33. D. The higher concentration of H+ inside the thylakoid compared to the stroma establishes an electrochemical
proton (H+) gradient that
 
drives the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP (Process II in figure) in the stroma. The enzyme ATP synthase catalyzes
this reaction. 34. B. The production of ATP from ADP is generated by the enzyme ATP synthase. The activation
energy for the reaction comes from the
 
electrochemical H+ (proton) gradient established by the higher concentration of H+ ins
