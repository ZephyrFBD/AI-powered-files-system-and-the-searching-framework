FIGURE 11–8 Position as a function
of time for a simple harmonic
oscillator, x = A cos(2ptT).
Starting with
t. The displacement of an object
is described by the following equation, where x is in meters and is in seconds:
Determine the oscillating object’s (a) amplitude, (b) frequency, (c) period,
(d) maximum speed, and (e) maximum acceleration.
APPROACH We start by comparing the given equation for x with Eq. 11–8b,
SOLUTION From
we see by inspection that (a) the amplitude
and (b) 
so 
(c) Then
(d) The maximum speed (see Eq. 11–7) is
(e) The maximum acceleration, by Newton’s second law, is 
because
is greatest when x is greatest. From Eq. 11–6b we
see that
