ted from the definition,
Eq. 15–4. It must be less than the maximum possible, Eq. 15–5.
SOLUTION The claimed efficiency of the engine is (Eq. 15–4b)
or 56%. The maximum possible efficiency is given by the Carnot efficiency,
Eq. 15–5:
or 34%. The manufacturer’s claims violate the second law of thermodynamics
and cannot be believed.

exhaust temperature
Which of the following are not possible efficiencies for
the engine? (a) 0.10; (b) 0.16; (c) 0.24; (d) 0.30; (e) 0.33.

We can see from Eq. 15–5 that at normal temperatures, a 100% efficient
engine is not possible. Only if the exhaust temperature,
were at absolute zero
would 100% efficiency be reachable. But getting to absolute zero is a practical (as
well as theoretical) impossibility. [Careful experimentation suggests that abso-
