rbic acid is present, binding of JB-76, the substrate of RZN45, decreases. The
reaction rate is affected by the presence of ascorbic acid as shown in the figure below. It is
thought that a daily supplement of Vitamin C might aid those suffering from Ritzolierreâ€™s
Disease, which is caused by elevated levels of RZN45.

6. Which of the following is likely true?
(A) RZN45 and JB-76 have similarly charged amino acids at their active sites.
(B) Ritzolinine is stabilized in the presence of Vitamin C.
(C) Ascorbic acid and JB-76 each have a pocket of negatively charged amino acids.
(D) JB-76 and ascorbic acid have an identical number of amino acids.
7. Which is the best explanation for the differing effects on reaction rate caused by ascorbic acid at low and high
concentrations of JB-76?
(A) At high concentrations of JB-76, there are fewer free active sites for the ascorbic acid to bind to.
(B) At low concentrations of JB-76, there are fewer free a
