Each type of ray was found to have a different charge and hence is bent dif-
ferently in a magnetic field, Fig. 30–4;
rays are positively charged,
rays are
negatively charged, and 
rays are neutral. It was soon found that all three types
of radiation consisted of familiar kinds of particles. Gamma rays are very high-
energy photons whose energy is even higher than that of X-rays. Beta rays were
found to be identical to electrons that orbit the nucleus, but they are created
within the nucleus itself. Alpha rays (or 
particles) are simply the nuclei of
helium atoms,
that is, an 
ray consists of two protons and two neutrons
bound together.
We now discuss each of these three types of radioactivity, or decay, in more
detail.

Experiments show that when nuclei decay, the number of nucleons (
