es, you can learn the scientific method, lab
techniques, and problem-solving skills. There is not an official set of labs that must be completed, and AP teachers
get to choose the ones for their classroom. This means that you will not be tested on memorizing specific protocols
or data from the labs. However, all labs teach the same basic skills of critical thinking, developing hypotheses,
judging results, making conclusions, adapting experiments, and understanding variables. So, those are the skills that
you are expected to fully understand. The exam will likely present you with example experiments, and you will need
to make decisions and answer questions about them. There are 13 labs that are very popular to do in AP Biology
classes, and these are the same labs that often come up on the AP Exam. We have given you short summaries of
those 13 labs. This way, if you encounter a question about one of these labs, you will be one step ahead of students
who have never even heard of it before
