nd in shade leaves because
the bend caused by the double bonds in the unsaturated fatty acids increases the separation of the phospholipids,
which increases the membraneâ€™s flexibility in response to cooler temperatures.
3. After the protein is produced by a ribosome on the membrane surface of the ER, the ER attaches a carbohydrate to
the protein and packages the glycoprotein within a vesicle. The vesicle then transports the glycoprotein to a Golgi
apparatus, where it may undergo additional modification. The modified glycoprotein is again packaged into a vesicle
that transports the glycoprotein from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane, where it is exported by
exocytosis.
Some Typical Answers to Long Questions
Question 1
a. Structure of the plasma membrane:
The plasma membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer. A molecule of phospholipid consists of two fatty
acids and a phosphate group attached to a glycerol component. The fatty acid tails represent a hydrophobic region of
th
