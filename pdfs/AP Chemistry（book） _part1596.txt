ure gases—those that consist of only one sub-
stance in the gaseous state. How do we deal with mixtures of two or more different gases? 
While studying the properties of air, John Dalton 
 (Section 2.1) made an important 
observation:
The total pressure of a mixture of gases equals the sum of the pressures that  
each would exert if it were present alone.
The pressure exerted by a particular component of a mixture of gases is called the par-
tial pressure of that component. Dalton’s observation is known as Dalton’s law of 
partial pressures.
If we let P
t be the total pressure of a mixture of gases and P
1, P
2, P
3, and so forth be the 
partial pressures of the individual gases, we can write Dalton’s law of partial pressures as
 
P
t = P
1 + P
2 + P
3 + c  
[10.12]
This equation implies that each gas behaves independently of the others, as we can see 
by the following analysis. Let n1, n2, n3, and so forth be the number of moles of each of 
the gases in the mixture and nt be the total
