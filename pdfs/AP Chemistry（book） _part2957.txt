Earth’s Atmosphere (Section 18.1)
 18.11  (a) What is the primary basis for the division of the atmo-
sphere into different regions? (b) Name the regions of the 
atmosphere, indicating the altitude interval for each one.
 18.12  (a) How are the boundaries between the regions of the 
atmosphere determined? (b) Explain why the stratosphere, 
which is about 35 km thick, has a smaller total mass than 
the troposphere, which is about 12 km thick.
 18.13  Air pollution in the Mexico City metropolitan area is 
among the worst in the world. The concentration of ozone 
in Mexico City has been measured at 441 ppb (0.441 ppm). 
Mexico City sits at an altitude of 7400 feet, which means 
its atmospheric pressure is only 0.67 atm. (a) Calculate 
the partial pressure of ozone at 441 ppb if the atmospheric 
pressure is 0.67 atm. (b) How many ozone molecules are in 
1.0 L of air in Mexi
