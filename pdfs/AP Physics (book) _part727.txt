CHAPTER 7
Linear Momentum
†The objects may begin to deflect even before they touch if electric, magnetic, or nuclear forces act
between them. You might think, for example, of two magnets oriented so that they repel each other:
when one moves toward the other, the second moves away before the first one touches it.
FIGURE 7;17 A recent color-
enhanced version of a cloud-chamber
photograph made in the early days
(1920s) of nuclear physics. Green
lines are paths of helium nuclei (He)
coming from the left. One He,
highlighted in yellow, strikes a proton
of the hydrogen gas in the chamber,
and both scatter at an angle; the 
scattered proton’s path is shown in red.
