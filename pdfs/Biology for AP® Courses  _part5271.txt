is and was told
there had been deaths from Covid on the dementia ﬂoor (conﬁrmed
by a test not testing for the ‘virus’) so they considered it ‘reasonable
to assume’. ‘But doctor,’ Mooney rightly protested, ‘an assumption
isn’t a diagnosis.’ She said she didn’t blame the perfectly decent and
sympathetic doctor – ‘he was just doing his job’. Sorry, but that’s
bullshit. He wasn’t doing his job at all. He was puĴing a false cause of
death on the death certiﬁcate and that is a criminal oﬀence for which
he should be brought to account and the same with the millions of
doctors worldwide who have done the same. They were not doing
their job they were following orders and that must not wash at new
Nuremberg trials any more than it did at the ﬁrst ones. Mooney’s
doctor was ‘assuming’ (presuming) as he was told to, but ‘just
following orders’ makes no diﬀerence to his actions. A doctor’s job is
to serve the patient and the truth, not follow orders, but that’s what
they have done all over the world
