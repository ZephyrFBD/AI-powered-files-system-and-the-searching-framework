g evolved in a common ancestor of the
Ampithoe, Caprella, and Aoridae, but was secondarily lost in
the Caprella.
(B)
Temperature tolerance was a trait possessed by the common
ancestor of all of these groups but was secondarily lost in
some groups, including Isopoda.
(C)
Temperature tolerance evolved in a common ancestor of the
Caprella.

3. Researchers use phylogenetic trees to understand the
evolutionary relationships between diﬀerent species. Which of
the following best describes the leȇmost branch of the
phylogenetic tree shown above?
Questions 4–5
The question “Which came first, the chicken or the egg?” is presented by
many people as an unsolvable conundrum. The phylogenetic tree shown
below is supported by molecular analysis of many diﬀerent proteins.
This branch includes a title that summarizes t
