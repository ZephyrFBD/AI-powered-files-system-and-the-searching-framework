n object is at
rest on the Earth, the gravitational force on it does not disappear, as we know if
we weigh it on a spring scale. The same force, given by Eq. 4–3, continues to act.
Why, then, doesn’t the object move? From Newton’s second law, the net force 
on an object that remains at rest is zero. There must be another force on the
object to balance the gravitational force. For an object resting on a table, the table
exerts this upward force; see Fig. 4–14a. The table is compressed slightly beneath
the object, and due to its elasticity, it pushes up on the object as shown. The force
exerted by the table is often called a contact force, since it occurs when two objects
are in contact. (The force of your hand pushing on a cart is also a contact force.)
When a contact force acts perpendicular to the common surface of contact, it 
is referred to as the normal force (“normal” means perpendicular); hence it is
labeled 
in Fig. 4–14a.
The two forces shown in Fig. 4–14a are both acting on th
