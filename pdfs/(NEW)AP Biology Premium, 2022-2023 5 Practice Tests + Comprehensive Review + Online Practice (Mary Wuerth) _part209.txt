ore energy from organic compounds than anaerobic organisms can.
First is a review of the major cellular processes of cellular respiration, which is then followed by a review of
fermentation.
As you review each cellular process, it is not necessary to memorize every step and enzyme involved! Focus on the flow of electrons and
energy through the process. For each process (glycolysis, oxidation of pyruvate, the Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and
fermentation), know where it happens and what the inputs and outputs are for each.
Glycolysis
Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol of the cell. Since all living organisms have cytosol, all living organisms can perform
glycolysis. Glycolysis was probably one of the first metabolic processes to evolve. This theory is supported by the
fact that enzymes, which catalyze the steps of glycolysis, are highly conserved and are found in all living organisms.
The six-carbon molecule glucose enters glycolysis, along with two molecules of the electron car
