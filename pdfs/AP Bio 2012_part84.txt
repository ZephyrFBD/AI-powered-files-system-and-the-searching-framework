ect. Although mitochondria and chloroplasts likely arose 
from free living prokaryotic cells, this does not explain the advantage for 
eukaryotic cells to have internal membranes.
(C)
This option is correct. It demonstrates understanding and provides an 
explanation of how internal membrane-bound organelles contribute to cell 
function by providing a favorable local environment for metabolic reactions, 
and by protecting the cell from potentially damaging metabolic reactions.
(D)
This option is incorrect. Compartmentalization does not increase mutation rates. 
Carrying out potentially harmful reactions within membrane-bound organelles 
may lower mutation rates because it protects DNA from possible damage.
