e the internal
energy increases and the temperature rises. In a diesel engine, the fuel–air mixture
is rapidly compressed adiabatically by a factor of 15 or more; the temperature
rise is so great that the mixture ignites spontaneously, without spark plugs.
Isobaric and Isovolumetric Processes
Isothermal and adiabatic processes are just two possible processes that can occur.
Two other simple thermodynamic processes are illustrated on the PV diagrams
of Fig. 15–4: (a) an isobaric process is one in which the pressure is kept constant,
so the process is represented by a straight horizontal line on the PV diagram
(Fig. 15–4a); (b) an isovolumetric (or isochoric) process is one in which the volume
does not change (Fig. 15–4b). In these, and in all other processes, the first law of
thermodynamics holds.
Work Done in Volume Changes
It is often valuable to calculate the work done in a process. If the pressure is kept
constant during a process (isobaric), the work done is easily calculated. For
