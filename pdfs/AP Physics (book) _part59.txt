Image of the Earth from a NASA satellite.
The sky appears black from out in space
because there are so few molecules
to reflect light. (Why the sky
appears blue to us on 
Earth has to do with 
scattering of light by 
molecules of the 
atmosphere, as 
discussed in 
Chapter 24.) 
Note the 
storm off 
the coast 
of Mexico.
