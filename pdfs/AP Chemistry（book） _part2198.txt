xponents m and n are typically small whole numbers, whose values are not necessarily 
equal to the coefficients a and b from the balanced equation. As we will learn shortly, if we 
know m and n for a reaction, we can gain great insight into the individual steps that occur 
during the reaction.
Give It Some Thought
Does the rate constant depend on the concentrations of the reactants?
Once we know the rate law for a reaction and the reaction rate for a set of reactant 
concentrations, we can calculate the value of k. For example, using the values for experi-
ment 1 in Table 14.2, we can substitute into Equation 14.6:
 
5.4 * 10-7 M>s = k10.0100 M210.200 M2 
 
 
    k =
5.4 * 10-7 M>s
10.0100 M210.200 M2 = 2.7 * 10-4 M-1s-1 
You should verify that this same value of k is obtained using any of the other experimen-
tal results in Table 14.2. 
Once we have both the rate law and the k value for a reaction, we can calcu-
late the reaction rate for any set of concentrations. For example, using
