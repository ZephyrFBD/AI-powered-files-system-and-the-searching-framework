expected results?
(A) The time required for the paper disks to float will decrease because the heat will cause a faster breakdown
of hydrogen peroxide.
(B) The time required for the paper disks to float will not change because heating the enzyme does not change
the hydrogen peroxide.
(C) The time required for the paper disks to float will increase because boiling will denature the enzyme.
(D) The time required for the paper disks to float will increase because all enzymes are less effective at higher
temperatures.
17. Why is O2 required for aerobic cellular respiration?
(A) O2 is required in glycolysis, the first step in the breakdown of glucose.
(B) O2 serves as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain.
(C) O2 is a substrate for the enzymes used in fermentation.
(D) O2 is used to transport pyruvate to the matrix of the mitochondria.
18. Which of the following questions is most relevant in understanding the Krebs cycle?
