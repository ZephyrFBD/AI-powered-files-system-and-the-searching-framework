n important consequence of the theory of relativity is that we can no longer
regard time as an absolute quantity. No one doubts that time flows onward and
never turns back. But according to relativity, the time interval between two
events, and even whether or not two events are simultaneous, depends on the
observer’s reference frame. By an event, which we use a lot here, we mean some-
thing that happens at a particular place and at a particular time.
Two events are said to occur simultaneously if they occur at exactly the same
time. But how do we know if two events occur precisely at the same time? If they
occur at the same point in space—such as two apples falling on your head at the
same time—it is easy. But if the two events occur at widely separated places, it is
more difficult to know whether the events are simultaneous since we have to take
into account the time it takes for the light from them to reach us. Because light
travels at finite speed, a person who sees two events must
