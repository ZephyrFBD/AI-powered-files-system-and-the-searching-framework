h a labeled arrow indicate the relative sign of the
electric potential difference (voltage) between
intracellular and extracellular spaces at the rest
electric potential

When an excitatory neurotransmitter receptor is activated
the electric potential difference of membrane of a neuron
is lowered inducing a change in the configuration of
sodium pump proteins.
B. Justify the effect on the flux of sodium ions across the
membrane as a positive feedback in a situation in which
the electric potential difference falls below a threshold
voltage and an action potential is created.
The action potential is transmitted along the neuron as a
voltage wave. One cycle of the wave is shown below the
diagram at the instant at which the maximum of the
electric potential of the membrane has been reached.
