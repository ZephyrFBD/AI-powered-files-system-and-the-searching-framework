; where 
is small, the probability is low.
We can interpret matter waves in the same way, as was first suggested by
Max Born (1882–1970) in 1927. The wave function 
may vary in magnitude
from point to point in space and time. If 
describes a collection of many electrons,
then 
at any point will be proportional to the number of electrons expected to
be found at that point. When dealing with small numbers of electrons we can’t
make very exact predictions, so 
takes on the character of a probability. If 
which depends on time and position, represents a single electron (say, in an atom),
then 
is interpreted like this:
at a certain point in space and time represents
the probability of finding the electron at the given position and time. Thus 
is
often referred to as the probability density or probability distribution.
Double-Slit Interference Experiment for Electrons
To understand this better, we take as a thought experiment the familiar double-slit
experiment, and consider it both for lig
