ants are labeled Ka1 and Ka2. The numbers on the 
constants refer to the particular proton of the acid that is ionizing. Thus, Ka2 always 
refers to the equilibrium involving removal of the second proton of a polyprotic acid.
We see that Ka2 for sulfurous acid is much smaller than Ka1. Because of electrostatic 
attractions, we would expect a positively charged proton to be lost more readily from the 
neutral H2SO3 molecule than from the negatively charged HSO3
- ion. This observation is 
general: It is always easier to remove the first proton from a polyprotic acid than to remove the 
second. Similarly, for an acid with three ionizable protons, it is easier to remove the sec-
ond proton than the third. Thus, the Ka values become successively smaller as successive 
protons are removed.
