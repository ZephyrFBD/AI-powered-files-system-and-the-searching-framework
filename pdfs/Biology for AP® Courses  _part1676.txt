Learning Objective 3.6 The student can predict how a change in a specific DNA or RNA sequence can
result in changes in gene expression.
The Science Practice Challenge Questions contain additional test questions for this section that will help you prepare for
the AP exam. These questions address the following standards:

The synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cellâ€™s energy than any other metabolic process. In turn, proteins account
for more mass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins perform virtually
every function of a cell. The process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mRNA message into
a polypeptide product. Amino acids are covalently strung together by interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from
approximately 50 amino acid residues to more than 1,000. Each individual amino acid has an amino group (NH2) a
