olecules. The first step in this process is ingestion. Ingestion
is the process of taking in food through the mouth. In vertebrates, the teeth, saliva, and tongue play important roles in
mastication (preparing the food into bolus). While the food is being mechanically broken down, the enzymes in saliva begin
to chemically process the food as well. The combined action of these processes modifies the food from large particles to a
soft mass that can be swallowed and can travel the length of the esophagus.
Digestion and Absorption
Digestion is the mechanical and chemical break down of food into small organic fragments. It is important to break down
macromolecules into smaller fragments that are of suitable size for absorption across the digestive epithelium. Large,
complex molecules of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids must be reduced to simpler particles such as simple sugar before
they can be absorbed by the digestive epithelial cells. Different organs play specific roles in the dig
