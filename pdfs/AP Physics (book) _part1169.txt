2 that the arc length 
is nearly the same length as the chord
indicated by the horizontal
straight dashed line, if
is small. For angles less than 15°, the difference between
(in radians) and 
is less than 1%—see Table 11–1. Thus, to a very good
approximation for small angles,
Substituting
or
we have
Thus, for small displacements, the motion can be modeled as being approximately
simple harmonic,because this approximate equation fits Hooke’s law,
where
in place of x we have arc length s. The effective force constant is 
If we
substitute 
into Eq. 11–6a, we obtain the period of a simple pendulum:
or
(11;11a)
The frequency is
so
(11;11b)
The mass m of the pendulum bob does not appear in these formulas for T and f.
Thus we have the surprising result that the period and frequency of a simple pen-
dulum do not depend on the mass of the pendulum bob. You may have noticed
this if you pushed a small child and then a large one on the same swing.
We also see from Eq. 11–11a that the period of a pe
