This is the smallest thickness.
NOTE At this small thickness, blue (450 nm) and red (600 nm) also would reflect
fairly constructively, so the bubble would appear almost white. The green color is
more likely to be seen at the next thickness that gives constructive interference,
because other colors would be more fully cancelled by destructive
interference. Then would be

Colors in a Thin Soap Film
The thin film of soapy water (in a plastic loop) shown in Fig. 24–29b (repeated
here) has stood vertically for a long time. Gravity has pulled the soapy water
downward, so the film increases in thickness going toward the bottom. The top
section is so thin (perhaps 30 nm thick
) that light reflected from the front
and back surfaces have almost zero path difference. Thus the 180° phase change
at the front surface assures that the two reflected waves are 180° out of phase for
all wavelengths of visible light. The white light inciden
