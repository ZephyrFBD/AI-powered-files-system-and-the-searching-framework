a stream of charged particles approaching the Earth. The velocity component
perpendicular to the field for each particle becomes a circular orbit around the
field lines, whereas the velocity component parallel to the field carries the particle
along the field lines toward the poles. As a particle approaches the Earth’s North
Pole, the magnetic field is stronger and the radius of the helical path becomes
smaller (see Example 20–6,
).
A high concentration of high-speed charged particles ionizes the air, and as
the electrons recombine with atoms, light is emitted (Chapter 27) which is the
aurora. Auroras are especially spectacular during periods of high sunspot activity
when more charged particles are emitted and more come toward Earth.
The Hall Effect
When a current-carrying conductor is held fixed in a magnetic field, the field
exerts a sideways force on the charges moving in the conductor. For example, if
electrons move to the right in the rectangular conductor shown in Fig. 20
