Linear Accelerators
In a linear accelerator (linac), electrons or ions are accelerated along a straight-
line path, Fig. 32–4, passing through a series of tubular conductors. Voltage applied
to the tubes is alternating so that when electrons (say) reach a gap, the tube in
front of them is positive and the one they just left is negative. At low speeds, the
particles cover less distance in the same amount of time, so the tubes are shorter at
first. Electrons, with their s
