nthesis occurs.
3.
In translation, tRNA carries amino acids to the mRNA and
assembles them into proteins based on the mRNA code.
Proteins are oȇen modified aȇer translation, giving them their
final structure.
4.
Mutations are the source of genetic change. Types include
base-pair substitutions, which aﬀect one amino acid, as well as
insertions and deletions, which shiȇ the genetic code and
aﬀect many amino acids.

Scientists can modify an organism’s DNA by adding new genes.

1. A biochemist is studying the mechanism of DNA replication by
stopping the reaction shortly aȇer its initiation. Analysis of the
products from the reaction on a gel reveals the presence of single-
stranded and double-stranded DNA. The shorter fragments of DNA
were found to be attached to a complementary sequence of 10
ribonucleotides.
Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the data?
Short fragments of mRNA bind at random to available single-
stranded DNA sequences in th
