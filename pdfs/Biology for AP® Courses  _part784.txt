ether are the equivalent of a hydrogen atom with an extra electron).
NAD+ can accept electrons from an organic molecule according to the general equation:

When electrons are added to a compound, they are reduced. A compound that reduces another is called a reducing agent. In
the above equation, RH is a reducing agent, and NAD+ is reduced to NADH. When electrons are removed from compound,
it is oxidized. A compound that oxidizes another is called an oxidizing agent. In the above equation, NAD+ is an oxidizing
agent, and RH is oxidized to R.
Similarly, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD+) is derived from vitamin B2, also called riboflavin. Its reduced form is FADH2.
A second variation of NAD, NADP, contains an extra phosphate group. Both NAD+ and FAD+ are extensively used in
energy extraction from sugars, and NADP plays an important role in anabolic reactions and photosynthesis.
