 spectrum, but not on the other end. This is why plants rich in carotenoids are yellow, orange, or red.
THE LIGHT REACTIONS
When a leaf captures sunlight, the energy is sent to P680, the reaction center for photosystem II. The activated
electrons are trapped by P680 and passed to a molecule called the primary acceptor, and then they are passed down
to carriers in the electron transport chain.
To replenish the electrons in the thylakoid, water is split into oxygen, hydrogen ions, and electrons. That process is
called photolysis. The electrons from photolysis replace the missing electrons in photosystem II.
As the energized electrons from photosystem II travel down the electron transport chain, they pump hydrogen ions
into the thylakoid lumen. A proton gradient is established. As the hydrogen ions move back into the stroma through
ATP synthase, ATP is produced.
After the electrons leave photosystem II, they go to photosystem I. The electrons are passed through a second
electron transport
