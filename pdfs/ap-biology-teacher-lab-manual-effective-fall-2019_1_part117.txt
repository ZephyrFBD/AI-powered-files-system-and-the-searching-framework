he personalities of the scientists. 
At first, students may need guidance, perhaps beginning with a list of questions (such as 
the following) to consider as they review others’ work: 
•  Equivalency of sources for comparison:  
Is there the same amount of material (e.g., tissue) in each experiment?  
How was the amount of material measured? Dry weight? Wet weight?  
Was the activity (e.g., reaction) reported per unit measure?  
Was the experimental procedure repeated several times?  
Was the sample size sufficient?  
•  Confounding variables:  
What conditions were controlled in the experiment?  
How were these conditions controlled?  
Were any variables overlooked?

•  Results and conclusions: 
Are the results significant? Do they support or refute the original hypothesis? 
Are the results reproducible? 
Are the conclusions supported by the data? 
Are there alternative conclusions? 
What additional questions can be asked that lend themselves to further
