allele, a child with a person who
did have cystic fibrosis would have no chance of inheriting the disease, though their child would be a
heterozygous carrier of the allele, as shown in the figure.
52. (C) The product formed by the enzymes of a repressible operon acts as a corepressor to help the repressor shut
off the operon when an excess of the product is present. Choice (A) is incorrect because arginine would not
induce the operon to turn on nor would arginine stimulate transcription, so choice (B) is also incorrect. Arginine
does not stimulate the production of cyclic AMP, so choice (D) is incorrect.
53. (B) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to make multiple copies of a specific DNA sequence. Choice (A)
is incorrect because gel electrophoresis is used to separate DNA fragments by size and charge. CRISPR-Cas9 is
used in gene editing, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because DNA sequencing is the process
of reading the sequence of nucleotide bases in DNA.
