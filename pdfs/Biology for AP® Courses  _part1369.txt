s is genetically possible.
a.
Both parents are homozygous for the dominant trait of brown eyes.
b.
Both parents are heterozygous, having the green trait on the green-blue eye gene.
c.
Both parents are heterozygous with the recessive trait of brown eyes.
d.
Both parents are homozygous having the green trait on the green-blue eye gene.
In some cases, several genes can contribute to aspects of a common phenotype without their gene products ever directly
interacting. In the case of organ development, for instance, genes may be expressed sequentially, with each gene adding to
the complexity and specificity of the organ. Genes may function in complementary or synergistic fashions, such that two or
more genes need to be expressed simultaneously to affect a phenotype. Genes may also oppose each other, with one gene
modifying the expression of another.
In epistasis, the interaction between genes is antagonistic, such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of
another. “Epistasis”
