 to absorb energy without
fracturing.)
B. Refine this representation by identifying an important
property of a biomaterial that is missing and explain its
importance in terms of free energy acquisition and use.
C. Explain how these data indicates that the properties of
biopolymers will lead to a better biomimetic design of the
humanoid robot than is imagined in C3PO of Star Wars
fame
38. An investigation of the evolution of muscle was made
by Steinmetz et al. (Nature, 487, 2012), and a sample of
data is presented in the following diagram. Below the
accepted phylogeny of major groups are rows with
families of genes that code for different muscle proteins,
including actin and myosin. Shared genes are shown
where the cell is darkened. Samples of genes associated
with striated and smooth muscle and the Z-disc that
terminates the actin-myosin pair are clustered. These are
shown in the diagram below, where groups in which
muscle cells occur lie within the box whose edges are
dashed lines.
