 boat be then?
APPROACH The boat now heads directly across the river and is pulled down-
stream by the current, as shown in Fig. 3–30. The boat’s velocity with respect to
the shore,
is the sum of its velocity with respect to the water,
plus the
velocity of the water with respect to the shore,
just as before,
SOLUTION (a) Since 
is perpendicular to 
we can get 
using the
theorem of Pythagoras:
We can obtain the angle (note how is defined in  Fig. 3–30) from:
A calculator with a key INV TAN or ARC TAN or  
gives
Note that this angle is not equal to the angle calculated in Example 3–10.
(b) The travel time for the boat is determined by the time it takes to cross the
river. Given the river’s width
we can use the velocity component in the
direction of D,
Solving for 
we get  
The boat will have been carried downstream, in this time, a distance
NOTE There is no acceleration in this Example, so the motion involves only
constant velocities (of the boat or of the river).
