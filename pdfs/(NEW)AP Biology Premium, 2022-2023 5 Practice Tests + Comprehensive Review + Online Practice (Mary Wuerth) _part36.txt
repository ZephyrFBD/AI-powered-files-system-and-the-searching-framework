would be appropriate to use the chi-square
test if you were comparing the number of purple flowers and the number of white flowers that resulted from a genetic cross. It would not be
appropriate to use the chi-square test to compare the percentage of purple flowers to the percentage of white flowers.
Consider the experiment that measured whether dogs prefer dog food brand A or dog food brand B. If there are
100 dogs, the null hypothesis would predict that 50 dogs would choose brand A and 50 dogs would choose brand B.
These are the expected results. If the experiment was carried out and 45 dogs chose brand A and 55 dogs chose
brand B, those are the observed results. The chi-square test could be used to evaluate the null hypothesis that there
will be no statistically significant difference between the expected results and the observed results of the experiment.
The steps of the chi-square test are as follows:
