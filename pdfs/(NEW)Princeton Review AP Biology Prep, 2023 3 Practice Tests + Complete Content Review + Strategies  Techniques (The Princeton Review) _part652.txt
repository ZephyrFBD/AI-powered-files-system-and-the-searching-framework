0, the biomass should be greater than 150.
40. A
The secondary consumersâ€™ biomass should always be less than that of the primary consumers, so the only

relationship in which one organism benefits and the other is harmed. Choice (B), commensalism, occurs when
one organism benefits and the other is unaffected. Choice (D), endosymbiosis, is the idea that some organelles
originated as symbiotic prokaryotes that live inside larger cells.
42. A
Both bacteria and fungi contain genetic material (DNA), a plasma membrane, and a cell wall. Unlike fungi,
bacteria lack a definite nucleus. Therefore, eliminate (B). Bacteria are unicellular, whereas fungi are both
unicellular and multicellular. Therefore, eliminate (C) and (D).
43. B
This question tests your understanding of what stage of gene expression utilizes RNA polymerase. Since the
presence of RNA polymerase is required
