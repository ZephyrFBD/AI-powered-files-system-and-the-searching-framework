avorite hypothetical re-
action: a A + b B ¡  
c C + d D. We shall assume that all the sub-
stances are soluble in water and that we carry out the reaction in 
aqueous solution. Substances A and C both absorb visible light, 
and the absorption maxima are 510 nm for A and for 640 nm for 
C. Substances B and D are colorless. You are provided with pure 
samples of all four substances and you know their chemical formu-
las. You are also provided appropriate instrumentation to obtain 
visible absorption spectra (see the Closer Look box on using spec-
troscopic methods in Section 14.3). Let’s design an experiment to 
ascertain the kinetics of our reaction. (a) What experiments could 
you design to determine the rate law and the rate constant for the 
reaction at room temperature? Would you need to know the values 
of the stoichiometric constants a and c in order to find the rate law? 
(b) Design an experiment to determine the activation energy for 
the reaction. What challenges might you fac
