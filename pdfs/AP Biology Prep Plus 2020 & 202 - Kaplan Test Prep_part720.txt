The circumstances described in the question stem provide an example
of disruptive selection, in which there are selective pressures in favor
of extreme phenotypes and against moderate phenotypes. This is
likely to produce a body size distribution in which there are more small
and large rabbits and fewer medium-sized rabbits. (D) is thus correct.
(A) is incorrect because it suggests that only small body size is selected
for, but large body size is also selected for. (B) is incorrect because it
suggests that only large body size is selected for, but small body size is
also selected for. (C) is incorrect because it presents an example of
stabilizing selection, in which the mean is favored over the extremes,
the opposite of the scenario described in the question stem.

In order to be present in all three domains (Bacteria, Achaea, and
Eukarya), glycolysis must be a primitive process. The presence of
glycolysi
