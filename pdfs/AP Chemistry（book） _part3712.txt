(and the 
removal of orange makes the light look blue).
Complementary colors can be determined with an artist’s color wheel, which shows 
complementary colors on opposite sides (Figure 23.25).
The amount of light absorbed by a sample as a function of wavelength is known as 
the sample’s absorption spectrum. The visible absorption spectrum of a transparent

▲ Figure 23.25 Two ways of perceiving the color orange. An object appears orange either when  
it reflects orange light to the eye (left) or when it transmits to the eye all colors except blue, the  
complement of orange (middle). Complementary colors lie opposite to each other on an artist’s  
color wheel (right).
The complex ion trans-3Co(NH3)4Cl24+ absorbs light primarily in the red region of the visible spectrum (the most intense 
absorpt
