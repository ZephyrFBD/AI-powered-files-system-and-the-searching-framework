t for living processes; it is a major component of nucleic acid and phospholipids, and, as
calcium phosphate, makes up the supportive components of our bones. Phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient (necessary
for growth) in aquatic ecosystems (Figure 37.19).
Phosphorus occurs in nature as the phosphate ion (PO43−). In addition to phosphate runoff as a result of human activity,
natural surface runoff occurs when it is leached from phosphate-containing rock by weathering, thus sending phosphates
into rivers, lakes, and the ocean. This rock has its origins in the ocean. Phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily
from the bodies of ocean organisms and from their excretions. However, in remote regions, volcanic ash, aerosols, and
mineral dust may also be significant phosphate sources. This sediment then is moved to land over geologic time by the
uplifting of areas of the Earth’s surface.
Phosphorus is also reciprocally exchanged between phosphate dissolved in the ocean and marin
