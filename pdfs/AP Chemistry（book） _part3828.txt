round the carbon–carbon bond, the cis and 
trans isomers of an alkene cannot readily interconvert and, therefore, exist as distinct 
compounds.

Draw all the structural and geometric isomers of pentene, C5H10, that have an unbranched hydrocarbon chain.
Solve 
There can be a double bond after either the 
first carbon (1-pentene) or second carbon 
(2-pentene). These are the only two possibili-
ties because the chain can be numbered from 
either end. Thus, what we might erroneously 
call 3-pentene is actually 2-pentene, as seen 
by numbering the carbon chain from the 
other end:
Analyze We are asked to draw all the isomers (both structural and 
geometric) for an alkene with a five-carbon chain.
Plan Because the compound is named pentene and not pent
