nitrate ions 1NO3
-), so its chemical formula is Ca1NO322. Because 
there are two NO3
- ions for each Ca2+ ion, each mole of Ca(NO322 
that dissolves dissociates into 1 mol of Ca2+ and 2 mol of NO3
-. 
Thus, a solution that is 0.025 M in Ca(NO322 is 0.025 M in Ca2+ 
and 2 * 0.025 M = 0.050 M in NO3

Check The concentration of NO3
- ions is twice that of Ca2+ ions, as the 
subscript 2 after the NO3
- in the chemical formula Ca(NO322 suggests.

CHAPTER 4 Reactions in Aqueous Solution
Interconverting Molarity, Moles, and Volume
If we know any two of the three quantities in the definition of molarity (Equation 4.31), 
we can calculate the third. For example, if we know the molarity of an HNO3 solution to 
be 0.200 M, which means 0.200 mol of HNO3 per liter of solution, we can calculate the 
number of moles of solute in a given volume, say 2.0 L. Molarity therefore is a conversion 
factor between volume of
