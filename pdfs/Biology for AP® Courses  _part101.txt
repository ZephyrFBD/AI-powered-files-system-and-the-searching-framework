t. Structures that aid in this type of insulation include fur,
feathers, blubber, and fat. In hot climates, organisms have methods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that
help them to shed excess body heat.

Energy Processing
Figure 1.14 The California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) uses chemical energy derived from food to power flight.
California condors are an endangered species; this bird has a wing tag that helps biologists identify the individual.

All organisms use a source of energy for their metabolic activities. Some organisms capture energy from the sun and convert
it into chemical energy in food; others use chemical energy in molecules they take in as food (Figure 1.14).
Activity
Select an ecosystem of your choice, such as a tropical rainforest, desert, or coral reef, and create a
representation to show how several organisms found in the ecosystem interact wit
