copies of chromosome 1 came from the sperm. This
illustrates uniparental disomy. (B) is also an example of uniparental
disomy because both copies of chromosome 1 came from the egg. For
(C), if two copies of chromosome 1 were in the egg and a normal
haploid sperm fertilized the egg, then the zygote would be triploid, not
diploid. (C) is not an accurate explanation and thus the correct answer.
(D) is a valid explanation because self-correction may occur if there is
an extra or missing chromosome. A single chromosome can duplicate
itself or an extra chromosome can be extruded.

A cross between two heterozygous individuals is expected to produce
a 3:1 ratio of dominant to recessive oﬀspring. Since cats with two
recessive alleles exhibit dilute fur, ¼ of the total oﬀspring (232) is
expected to have dilute fur: ¼ × 232 = 58. Therefore, (B) is correct.

If the genes are tightly linked and no crossing over occurs, then all of
the chro
