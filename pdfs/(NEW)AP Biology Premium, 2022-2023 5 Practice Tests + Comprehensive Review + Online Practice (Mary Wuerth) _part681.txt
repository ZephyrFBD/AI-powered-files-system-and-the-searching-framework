ey species, in this ecosystem,
so choice (D) is also incorrect.
54. (C) Ecosystems can be disrupted and thrown out of balance if energy availability changes. A net gain in energy
can result in the gain of mass by an organism; it would not result in the death of the organism, so choice (A) is
incorrect. Energy is not recycled through ecosystems; each change in trophic level results in a loss of energy
(from the consumer to the environment) as heat. So choice (B) is also incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because
autotrophs, not heterotrophs, capture the energy in sunlight.
55. (D) K-selected populations do not far exceed their environment’s carrying capacity; once a K-selected
population reaches the carrying capacity, its numbers fluctuate moderately around the environment’s carrying
capacity. r-selected populations will fluctuate greatly around their environment’s carrying capacity and far
exceed it on occasion. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are all true statements about population growth.
