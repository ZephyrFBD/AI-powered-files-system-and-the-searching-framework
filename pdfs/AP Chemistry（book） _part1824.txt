 (a) Which of the two substances is expected to have the 
greater dipole–dipole forces? Which is expected to have the 
greater dispersion forces? Based on your answers, explain 
why it is difficult to predict which compound would be 
more volatile. (b) Which compound would you expect 
to have the higher boiling point? Check your answer in a 
reference book such as the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and 
Physics. (c) The order of volatility of these two substances 
changes as the temperature is increased. What quantity 
must be different for the two substances for this phenom-
enon to occur? (d) Substantiate your answer for part (c) by 
drawing an appropriate graph.
