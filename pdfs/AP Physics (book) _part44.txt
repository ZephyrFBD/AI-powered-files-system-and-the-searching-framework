more advanced physics material, or material not usually covered in typical 
courses and/or interesting applications; they contain no material needed in later
Chapters (except perhaps in later optional Sections).
For a brief course, all optional material could be dropped as well as significant
parts of Chapters 1, 10, 12, 22, 28, 29, 32, and selected parts of Chapters 7, 8, 9,
15, 21, 24, 25, 31. Topics not covered in class can be a valuable resource for later
study by students. Indeed, this text can serve as a useful reference for years because
of its wide range of coverage.
â€ It is fine to take a calculus course. But mixing calculus with physics for these students may often
mean not learning the physics because of stumbling over the calculus.
