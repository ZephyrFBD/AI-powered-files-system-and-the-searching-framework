lar structures of Plasmodium falciparum 
  The eukaryotic protozoan parasite P. falciparum is the causative agent of malaria. P. falciparum cells 
contain an organelle called the apicoplast (see Figure 1). Apicoplasts synthesize precursors of 
biomolecules that are required for growth and reproduction of the parasite. 
(a) Based on Figure 1, describe TWO pieces of evidence a researcher could use to support the claim 
that apicoplasts evolved from free-living, prokaryotic organisms. (2 points) 
 
Description (2 points maximum) 
• Possesses a double membrane  
• Possesses DNA 
 
(b) Doxycycline is a drug used to treat malaria and some bacterial infections. Doxycycline binds to the 
prokaryotic 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibits its function. Explain how doxycycline can be an 
effective treatment for a P. falciparum infection in humans. (2 points) 
 
Explanation (2 points maximum) 
• Apicoplasts possess 30S/prokaryotic ribosomes 
• Prokaryotic/apicoplast proteins are not synthesized (in p
