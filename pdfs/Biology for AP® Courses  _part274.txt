on). If the hydroxyl group is below
carbon number 1 in the sugar, it is said to be in the alpha (α) position, and if it is above the plane, it is said to be in the beta
(β) position.

Figure 3.7 Five and six carbon monosaccharides exist in equilibrium between linear and ring forms. When the ring
forms, the side chain it closes on is locked into an α or β position. Fructose and ribose also form rings, although they
form five-membered rings as opposed to the six-membered ring of glucose.
Disaccharides
Disaccharides (di- = “two”) form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction (also known as a
condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis). During this process, the hydroxyl group of one monosaccharide combines
with the hydrogen of another monosaccharide, releasing a molecule of water and forming a covalent bond. A covalent bond
formed between a carbohydrate molecule and another molecule (in this case, between two monosaccharides) is kn
