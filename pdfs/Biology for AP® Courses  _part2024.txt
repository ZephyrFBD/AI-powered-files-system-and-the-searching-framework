lled autopolyploidy (Figure 18.17). The prefix “auto-” means “self,”
so the term means multiple chromosomes from one’s own species. Polyploidy results from an error in meiosis in which all
of the chromosomes move into one cell instead of separating.
Figure 18.17 Autopolyploidy results when mitosis is not followed by cytokinesis.
For example, if a plant species with 2n = 6 produces autopolyploid gametes that are also diploid (2n = 6, when they should
be n = 3), the gametes now have twice as many chromosomes as they should have. These new gametes will be incompatible
with the normal gametes produced by this plant species. However, they could either self-pollinate or reproduce with other
autopolyploid plants with gametes having the same diploid number. In this way, sympatric speciation can occur quickly by

forming offspring with 4n called a tetraploid. These individuals would immediately be able to reproduce only with those of
this new kind
