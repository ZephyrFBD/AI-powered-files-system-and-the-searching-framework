n—how light rays bend
when they go from one medium to
another—and how, via refraction,
images are formed by lenses, which
are the crucial part of so many
optical instruments.

he sense of sight is extremely important to us, for it provides us with a large
part of our information about the world. How do we see? What is the some-
thing called light that enters our eyes and causes the sensation of sight?
How does light
