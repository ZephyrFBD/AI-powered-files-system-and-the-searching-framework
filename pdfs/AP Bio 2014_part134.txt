ation, and provide reasoning to explain how the result supports the claim.  
(2 points maximum; LO3.1, 3.2) 
 
Prediction (1 point) 
• 
Radioactive phosphorus label is found mostly inside infected cells.  
• 
Radioactive sulfur label is found mostly in the growth media/not inside the cells. 
 
 
Reasoning (1 point) 
• 
Radioactive phosphorus labels DNA.  
• 
Radioactive sulfur does not label DNA. 
• 
Radioactive sulfur primarily labels proteins. 
• 
Presence of radioactive phosphorus inside cell supports DNA as hereditary information. 
 
 (b) Bacteriophages, like other viruses, consist primarily of a protein coat and packaged DNA. 
 
Describe the function of ONE critical enzyme in bacterial cells that is necessary for replicating
 
bacteriophage DNA. (1 point maximum; LO3.3) 
 
• 
DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA. 
• 
Helicase and/or topoisomerases unwind parental DNA.  
• 
Ligase joins Okazaki fragments.
