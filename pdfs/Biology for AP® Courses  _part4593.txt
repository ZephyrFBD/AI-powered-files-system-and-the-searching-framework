ability of the
dominant allele A, p, and the recessive allele a, q. The
Hardy-Weinberg model of population dynamics is based
on several assumptions. One of these assumptions is
“random mating.” If all genes in a population are equally
able to reproduce, this means that all genes are equally fit
and equally fertile. Consequently, the population never
evolves.
Populations do evolve and the Hardy-Weinberg model can
be modified slightly to allow evolution to occur. Suppose
that there is an initial population at generation zero and the
probability of the dominant allele at that time is p0. Later,
at population k the probability is different. But if the
frequencies of the three different combinations of alleles is
known then the probabilities pk and qk can be calculated at
generation k
(1) pk = Fk(AA) + ½Fk(Aa) qk = Fk(aa) + ½Fk(Aa)
And since p and q are probabilities for a case where only
two alleles exist, p+q=1. Then also (p+q)2=1, leading the
Hardy-Weinberg equation
