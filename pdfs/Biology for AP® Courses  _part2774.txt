A seedling growing in the shade of a mature
plant will not have enough light to promote
meristematic growth. A seed with large storage
will be able to sustain growth until its seedling
can reach enough light for photosynthesis.
b.
A seedling growing in the shade of a mature
plant will not have enough light to promote
photosynthesis. Small seeds with limited reserve
will be able to sustain growth until seedlings can
reach enough light for photosynthesis.
c.
A seedling growing in the shade of a mature
plant will not have enough light to promote
photosynthesis. A seed with large storage will be
able to sustain growth until its seedling can
reach enough light for photosynthesis.
d.
A seedling growing in the shade of a mature
plant will not have enough light to promote
respiration. Small seeds with limited reserve will
be able to sustain growth until their seedlings
can reach enough
