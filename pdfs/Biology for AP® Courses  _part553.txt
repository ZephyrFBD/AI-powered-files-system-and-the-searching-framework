enters the
cell, causing it to swell and possibly burst. The cell walls of plants prevent them from bursting, but animal cells, such as
red blood cells, can lyse. When a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, water leaves the cell because the cell has a higher
water potential than the extracellular solution. When the concentrations of solute are equal on both sides of the membrane
(isotonic), no net movement of water into or out of the cell occurs. Living organisms have evolved a variety of ways to
maintain osmotic balance; for example, marine fish secrete excess salt through the gills to maintain dynamic homeostasis.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined in Big
Idea 2 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The learning objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
