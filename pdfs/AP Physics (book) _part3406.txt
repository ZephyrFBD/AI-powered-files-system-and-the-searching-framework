7. What are the similarities and the differences between the
strong nuclear force and the electric force?
8. What is the experimental evidence in favor of radioactivity
being a nuclear process?
9. The isotope 
is unusual in that it can decay by 
and 
emission. What is the resulting nuclide for each case?
10. A

decay to a nucleus containing

11. Describe, in as many ways as you can, the difference
between 
and

13. Immediately after a 
nucleus decays to 
the daughter thorium nucleus may still have 92 electrons
circling it. Since thorium normally holds only 90 electrons,
what do you suppose happens to the two extra ones?
14. When a nucleus undergoes either 
or 
decay, what hap-
pens to the energy levels of the atomic electrons? What is
likely to happen to these electrons following the decay?
