f point charges is far easier,
because the electric potential is a scalar, and hence you only need to add numbers
(with appropriate signs) without concern for direction.
Potential above two charges. Calculate the electric poten-
tial (a) at point A in Fig. 17–10 due to the two charges shown, and (b) at point B.
[This is the same situation as Examples 16–9 and 16–10, Fig. 16–29, where we
calculated the electric field at these points.]
APPROACH The total potential at point A (or at point B) is the algebraic sum
of the potentials at that point due to each of the two charges 
and 
The
potential due to each single charge is given by Eq. 17–5. We do not have to
worry about directions because electric potential is a scalar quantity. But we do
have to keep track of the signs of charges.
