 is from the Greek for “moving”).
When an object slides along a rough surface, the force of kinetic friction acts
opposite to the direction of the object’s velocity. The magnitude of the force of
kinetic friction depends on the nature of the two sliding surfaces. For given 
surfaces, experiment shows that the friction force is approximately proportional
to the normal force between the two surfaces, which is the force that either 
object exerts on the other and is perpendicular to their common surface of contact
(see Fig. 4–27). The force of friction between hard surfaces in many cases depends
very little on the total surface area of contact; that is, the friction force on this book
is roughly the same whether it is being slid across a table on its wide face or on its
spine, assuming the surfaces have the same smoothness. We consider a simple model
of friction in which we make this assumption that the friction force is indepen-
dent of area. Then we write the proportionality between the
