The formation of H2O, CO2, and N2 reflects the high thermodynamic stability of these 
substances, indicated by the large bond energies for the O ¬H, C “O, and N‚N bonds 
(463, 799, and 941 kJ/mol, respectively). 
 (Sections 5.8 and 8.8)
When dealing with proton-transfer reactions, remember that the weaker a Brønsted– 
Lowry acid, the stronger its conjugate base. 
 (Section 16.2) For example, 
H2, OH -, NH3, and CH4 are exceedingly weak proton donors that have no tendency to act 
as acids in water. Thus, the species formed by removing one or more protons from them 
are extremely strong bases. All of them react readily with water, removing protons from 
H2O to form OH -. Two representative reactions are:
 
CH3
-1aq2 + H2O1l2 ¡  CH41g2 + OH -1aq2 
[22.2]
 
N3 -1aq2 + 3 H2O1l2 ¡  NH31aq2 + 3 OH -1aq2 
[22.3]
*Giving unique names to isotopes is limited to hydrogen. Because of the proportionally large dif-
ferences in their masses, the isotopes of H show appreciably more differences in t
