ction would be unaﬀected because transcription of DNA to
RNA occurs in the nucleus, prior to any interaction with the ER. While
carbohydrates can be added to proteins made in the rough ER and
then transported to areas of the cell where they are needed or sent to
the Golgi apparatus for further processing and modification, they are
not actually produced in the ER. Additionally, metabolism, but not
production, of carbohydrates through hydrolysis occurs in the smooth
ER. Thus, because only protein and lipid production would be
decreased, but not RNA or carbohydrate production, (C) is correct.
