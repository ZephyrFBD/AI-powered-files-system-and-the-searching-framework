able had the same water potential as the 0.35 molar sucrose
solution, its cells would be isotonic to the sucrose solution, and you would expect to find a 0% change in
mass. The smaller the percent change in mass, the closer the vegetable’s water potential is to that of the 0.35
molar sucrose solution. The potato has a water potential that is closest to that of the 0.35 molar sucrose
solution because its percent change in mass (–3.5%) is the smallest and closest to zero.
(d) Turnips would have a percent change in mass that is greater than +7.5% but less than +21.5%. Since turnips
have a higher sugar content than carrots, the water potential of the turnip cells would be less than that of the
carrot cells. So the turnips would gain more water from the surrounding 0.35 molar sucrose solution than
the carrots did (more than 7.5%). Since the turnips have a lower sugar content than the beets, the water
potential of the turnip cells would be higher than the water potential of the beet cells. S
