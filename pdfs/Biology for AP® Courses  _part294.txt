ts. Mammals store fats
in specialized cells called adipocytes, where globules of fat occupy most of the cell’s volume. In plants, fat or oil is stored
in many seeds and is used as a source of energy during seedling development. Unsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant
origin and contain cis unsaturated fatty acids. Cis and trans indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double
bond. If hydrogens are present in the same plane, it is referred to as a cis fat; if the hydrogen atoms are on two different
planes, it is referred to as a trans fat. The cis double bond causes a bend or a “kink” that prevents the fatty acids from
packing tightly, keeping them liquid at room temperature (Figure 3.17). Olive oil, corn oil, canola oil, and cod liver oil are
examples of unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats help to lower blood cholesterol levels whereas saturated fats contribute to
plaque formation in the arteries.
