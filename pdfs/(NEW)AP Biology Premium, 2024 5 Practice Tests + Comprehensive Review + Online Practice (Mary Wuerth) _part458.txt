lele to survive and reproduce at a greater rate than
individuals who did not possess the allele. Choice (B) is incorrect because TAS2R38 does not cause individuals
to consume bitter foods; it just influences their ability to taste bitter foods. Bitter foods do not necessarily have a
higher nutrient content than other foods, so choice (C) is incorrect. There is no evidence in the question that the
TAS2R38 allele lowered an individualâ€™s chance of survival, so choice (D) is incorrect.
8. (A) Artificial selection occurs when humans selectively breed organisms for desired traits. Frequency-
dependent selection occurs when the survival of an organism depends on its frequency in an environment, so
choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (C) is incorrect because in natural selection, the environment selects for which
individuals survive and reproduce. There is no evidence for mate choice in the question; plants usually depend
on the wind or animal pollinators to exchange gametes, so choice (D) is inco
