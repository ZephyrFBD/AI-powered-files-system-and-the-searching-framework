ephridia, and why?
a.
The urethral opening, because this is where
wastes leave the body
b.
The convoluted tubule, because this is where
reabsorption and secretion occur
c.
The glomerulus, because this is where
reabsorption and secretion occur
d.
The ureter, because this is where wastes leave

59. The Malpighian tubules filter waste materials out of
the blood, or hemolymph, of insects. There are cells lining
the tubules that pump solutes (mainly ions) into the space
surrounding the Malpighian tubules. If you observed a
gradual increase in the solute concentration outside of the
Malpighian tubules, what would you expect to happen?
a.
Water would be drawn out of the hemolymph
within the tubule.
b.
Water would be drawn into the tubule.
c.
Ions would be drawn out of the hemolymph
within the tubule.
d.
Ions would be drawn into the tubule.
60. The flame cells of a protonephridia filter waste
materials out of the blood, or hemolymph, of invertebrates.
