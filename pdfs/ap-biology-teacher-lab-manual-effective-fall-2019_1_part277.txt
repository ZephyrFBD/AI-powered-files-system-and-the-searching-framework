1e-04 (1 x 10-4) can be considered related with an 
error rate of less than 0.01%. 
1. What species in the BLAST result has the most similar gene sequence to the gene of 
interest? 
2. Where is that species located on your cladogram? 
3. How similar is that gene sequence? 
4. What species has the next most similar gene sequence to the gene of interest? 
Based on what you have learned from the sequence analysis and what you know from 
the structure, decide where the new fossil species belongs on the cladogram with the 
other organisms. If necessary, redraw the cladogram you created before.

■ Evaluating Results 
Compare and discuss your cladogram with your classmates. Does everyone agree with 
the placement of the fossil specimen? If not, what is the basis of the disagreement? 
On the main page of BLAST, click on the link “List All Genomic Databases.” How 
many genomes are currently available for making comparisons using
