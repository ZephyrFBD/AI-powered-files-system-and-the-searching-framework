ȇed to the leȇ. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that
region A denotes individuals who were selected against by recent
conditions in the environment, who died out because they fared
poorly. (D) is thus correct.
28. B
The graph shows the movement of the mean trait value in the
direction of one of the extremes (in this case, toward smaller size). This
is known as directional selection, (B). (A) is incorrect because
disruptive (or diversifying) selection favors phenotypes at both
extremes and disfavors intermediate values. (C) is incorrect because
stabilizing selection favors intermediate phenotypes, causing there to
be relatively fewer phenotypes at the extremes. (D) is incorrect
because there is no evidence that this shiȇ was the result of artificial
selection (i.e., breeding).
29. D
The situation from the question stem describes stabilizing selection,
which favors intermediate phenotypes over extremes. The resulting
curve would be higher and narrower with the same mean as the
current cu
