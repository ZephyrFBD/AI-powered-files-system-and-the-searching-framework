that includes a thin black line
(our object) on a white background.
The image of this black line has a
colored “halo” (red above, blue below)
due to the mosaic arrangement of

colors transmitted to the image.
Computer averaging minimizes such
color problems (the green at top and

Camera Adjustments
There are three main adjustments on good-quality cameras: shutter speed, f-stop,

For special or top-quality work, a manual camera is indispensable (Fig. 25–5).
Exposure time or shutter speed This refers to how quickly the digital sensor
can make an accurate reading of the images, or how long the shutter of a camera
is open and the film or sensor is exposed. It could vary from
