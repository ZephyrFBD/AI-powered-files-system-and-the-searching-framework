You might notice slight variations in periodic tables from one book to another or between 
those in the lecture hall and in the text. These are simply matters of style, or they might 
concern the particular information included. There are no fundamental differences.
The horizontal rows of the periodic table are called periods. The first period con-
sists of only two elements, hydrogen (H) and helium (He). The second and third periods 
consist of eight elements each. The fourth and fifth periods contain 18 elements. The 
sixth and seventh periods have 32 elements each, but in order to fit on a page 14 of the 
elements from each period (atomic numbers 57–70 and 89–102) appear at the bottom of 
the table.
The vertical columns are groups. The way in which the groups are labeled is somewhat 
arbitrary. Three labeling schemes are in common use, two of which are shown in Figure 2.14.
