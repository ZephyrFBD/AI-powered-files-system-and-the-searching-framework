SECTION 9.2    
The VSEPR Model

The C on the left has four electron domains (all bonding), so the electron-domain 
and molecular geometries around that atom are both tetrahedral. The central C has 
three electron domains (counting the double bond as one domain), making both the 
electron-domain and the molecular geometries trigonal planar. The O on the right has 
four electron domains (two bonding, two nonbonding), so its electron-domain geome-
try is tetrahedral and its molecular geometry is bent. The bond angles about the central 
C atom and the O atom are expected to deviate slightly from the ideal values of 120° and 
109.5° beca
