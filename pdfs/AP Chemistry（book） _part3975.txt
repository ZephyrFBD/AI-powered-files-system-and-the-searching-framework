2.6 Formula: IF5; name: iodine pentaﬂuoride; the compound is molec-
ular. 2.8 Only Ca1NO322, calcium nitrate, is consistent with the dia-
gram. 2.10 (a) In the presence of an electric ﬁeld, there is electrostatic 
attraction between the negatively charged oil drops and the positively 
charged plate as well as electrostatic repulsion between the negatively 
charged oil drops and the negatively charged plate. These electrostatic 
forces oppose the force of gravity and change the rate of fall of the 
drops. (b) Each individual drop has a different number of electrons 
associated with it. If the combined electrostatic forces are greater than 
the force of gravity, the drop moves up. 2.11 (a) mass O>mas
