conformational change. The new
arrangement of atoms in the protein opens passageways or exposes active sites for binding.
6. D. At each step of the signaling cascade, a kinase enzyme can catalyze multiple reactions. Each of those reactions
is then the beginning of the next step of the cascade, now multiplied many times over. Each step, then, has a
multiplier effect, amplifying the signal. Also, because there are multiple participants, the signaling cascade is more
susceptible to the influence of mutations, as a mutation in any member of the cascade can have a deleterious effect
on the ultimate product of the signal.
7. C. Nonpolar ligands can cross the plasma membrane without assistance. They enter the cytoplasm and bind to
intracellular receptor proteins.
8. B. An activated G protein-coupled receptor exchanges a GTP for a GDP on a nearby membrane-bound G protein.
The exchange activates the G protein. A GTP exchange for GDP can also occur for a RTK receptor pathway (like
the one involv
