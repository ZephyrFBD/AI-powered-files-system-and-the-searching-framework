us call the process represented by the graph “Process I” and consider another 
reaction, “Process II,” in which A is also consumed. Suppose that we start Process II 
also with 100 mg of A, and that after 1, 2, and 3 hours there are 90, 80, and 70 mg, 
respectively, left. The progress curve for Process II is displayed in Figure A.9.

Now, suppose we want to compare the graphs for the two processes. Because they have 
exactly the same scales, we can put both lines on the same graph, as shown in Figure 
A.10. Notice, however, that now in addition to the labels on the scales, we need labels on 
the two lines to distinguish between the two processes. 
Look at the 1-hour mark on the time scale of the graph. Opposite this put an X on the 
line for Process I and a Y on the line for Process II. Then, opposite X on the ordinate you 
should be
