nd out of
the nucleus, and linear DNA.
2. Have membrane-bound organelles. Plants have chloroplasts, for example, where photosynthesis is
carried out, and many plant cells have a large, central vacuole that is absent in most animal cells.
3. Plants have rigid cell walls made of the polymer cellulose, but animal cells do not have cell walls.
4. Like prokaryotes, eukaryotes contain a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes (location of
protein synthesis).
5. Contain histones that form into chromosomes.

Eukaryotic Organelles
A. Eukaryotic cells maintain internal organelles for specialized functions. Some of these include the
following:
