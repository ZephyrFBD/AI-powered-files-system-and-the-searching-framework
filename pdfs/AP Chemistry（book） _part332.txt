and 
selenium are both in group 6A and form analogous oxyanions.)
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of the following oxyanions is incorrectly named?  
(a) ClO -
2 , chlorate (b) IO -
4 , periodate (c) SO 2 -
3
, sulfite  
(d) IO3
-, iodate (e) NO -
2 , nitrite
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
The formula for the bromate ion is analogous to that for the 
chlorate ion. Write the formula for the hypobromite and  
bromite ions.
SOLUTION
(a)  
The sulfate ion is SO4
2-. The analogous selenate ion is  
therefore SeO4
2-.
(b)  
The ending -ite indicates an oxyanion with the same 
charge but one O atom fewer than the corresponding 
oxyanion that ends in -ate. Thus, the formula for the  
selenite ion is SeO3
2-.
