 [24.96]  An unknown organic compound is found on elemental 
analysis to contain 68.1% carbon, 13.7% hydrogen, and 
18.2% oxygen by mass. It is slightly soluble in water. Upon 
careful oxidation it is converted into a compound that 
behaves chemically like a ketone and contains 69.7% car-
bon, 11.7% hydrogen, and 18.6% oxygen by mass. Indicate 
two or more reasonable structures for the unknown.
 24.97  An organic compound is analyzed and found to contain
