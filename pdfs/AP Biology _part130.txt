cytoplasm. In contrast,
hydrophilic signaling molecules, those that bond to a receptor on the
cell surface, require a second messenger. An ion-channel receptor is
an example of a receptor on the surface of the cell. (IST-3)
(D) Although choices A, B, and C are correct statements, only choice
D answers the question. The important thing about signal
transduction is that a single signal can be amplified manyfold. (IST-
3)
(A) Tyrosine kinase receptors, G protein–coupled receptors, and ion-
channel receptors are all receptors on the surface of the plasma
membrane. When the receptor is on the surface of the cell, a second
messenger, like cyclic AMP, is required. (IST-3)
