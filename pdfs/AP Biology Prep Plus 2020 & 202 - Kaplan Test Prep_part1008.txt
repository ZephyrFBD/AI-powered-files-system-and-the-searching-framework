s of four subunits (two α
and two β). Sickle cell anemia (abnormally shaped red blood
cells) is caused by a mutation in the 20th nucleotide of the
hemoglobin β gene, in which glutamic acid is changed for valine.
Which of the following describes the result of the substitution?
The mutation has no eﬀect on the structure of hemoglobin.
(A)
The cell stops the production of hemoglobin.
(B)
The properties of the amino acid are not altered, so
hemoglobin does not lose its function.
(C)
The structure and function of hemoglobin are altered.
(D)
44. A frameshiȇ mutation is caused by an insertion or deletion of one
or more nucleotides in the DNA sequence. Which would most
likely be the result of inserting one nucleotide instead of
substituting a base in the DNA sequence?
The frameshiȇ mutation alters the R-groups in RNA.
(A)
The amino acid sequence changes aȇer the insertion.
(B)
The insertion causes a missense mutation, resulting in a
nonfunctional protein.
(C)
The frameshiȇ mutation aﬀects the
