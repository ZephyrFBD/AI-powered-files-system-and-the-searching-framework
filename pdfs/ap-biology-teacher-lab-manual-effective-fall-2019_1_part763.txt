surface or on white paper. 
Step 5 Give the flies at least 5 minutes of undisturbed time, and then count (or closely 
approximate) the number of flies at each end of the chamber. Create a table to record the 
number of flies you find at each end (A and B) of the chamber.   
Step 6 List all of the substances that you will be testing, and predict what you think the 
flies will prefer based on your knowledge of fruit flies. 
Step 7 Begin to test each substance you are including in your investigation. Place a few 
drops of one substance on a cotton ball. Remove cap A, place the cotton ball in the cap, 
and replace the cap on the chamber. Place a cotton ball with distilled water on the other 
end. How might you determine which of the substances stimulate a negative chemotaxis 
and which stimulate a positive chemotaxis? 
Step 8 Lay the chamber down on a light colored surface (or on white paper)
 and observe the flies. 
Step 9 Give the flies at least 5 minutes of undisturbed time, and then co
