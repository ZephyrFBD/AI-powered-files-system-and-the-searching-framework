 for instance, the oxidation efficiency of NADH is reduced, impacting oxidative phosphorylation but
not the other steps of respiration. Symptoms of mitochondrial diseases can include muscle weakness, lack
of coordination, stroke-like episodes, and loss of vision and hearing. Most affected people are diagnosed in
childhood, although there are some adult-onset diseases. Identifying and treating mitochondrial disorders
is a specialized medical field. The educational preparation for this profession requires a college education,
followed by medical school with a specialization in medical genetics. Medical geneticists can be board
certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics and go on to become associated with professional
organizations devoted to the study of mitochondrial diseases, such as the Mitochondrial Medicine Society
and the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disease.
