 The flow of H+ is what allows ATP synthase
in the membranes to produce ATP. Thus, the experiment supports the
hypothesis in (D). (A) is incorrect because no NADPH was added to the
flasks. (B) is incorrect because the experiment was conducted in
darkness. (C) is incorrect because the membranes were not damaged
in the experiment.

The platelet behavior described in the question stem is a classic
example of positive feedback, in which one response (the activation of
the platelets) leads to more of the same eï¬€ect. (B) is thus correct. (A) is
incorrect because this is positive feedback, not negative feedback. (C)
TEST WHAT YOU LEARNED
is incorrect because there is a separate negative feedback loop
(described in the question stem) that stops platelet activation. (D) is
incorrect because platelet activation promotes activation of inactive
platelets, but does not cause more platelets to be produced.
