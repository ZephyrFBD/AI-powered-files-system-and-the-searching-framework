In summary,
(E;3)
These are called the Lorentz transformation equations. They were first pro-
posed, in a slightly different form, by Lorentz in 1904 to explain the null result of
the Michelson–Morley experiment and to make Maxwell’s equations take the
same form in all inertial reference frames. A year later, Einstein derived them
independently based on his theory of relativity. Notice that not only is the x equa-
tion modified as compared to the Galilean transformation, but so is the equation.
Indeed, we see directly in this last equation how the space and time coordinates mix.
The relativistically correct velocity equations are obtained using Eqs.E–3
(we let 
) and 
The others are obtained in the same way, and we collect them here:
(E;4)
The first of these equations is Eq. 26–11, which we used in Section 26–10 where
we discussed how velocities do not add in our commonsense (Galilean) way,
because of the denominator 
We can now also see that the y and z
components of velocity are
