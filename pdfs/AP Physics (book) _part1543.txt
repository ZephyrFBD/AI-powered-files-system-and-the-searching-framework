EXAMPLE 14;8
You might notice in Example 14–8 that 15°C is not very warm for the living
room of a house. The room itself may indeed be much warmer, and the outside
might be colder than 14°C. But the temperatures of 15°C and 14°C were spec-
ified as those at the window surfaces, and there is usually a considerable drop 
in temperature of the air in the vicinity of the window both on the inside and the
outside. That is, the layer of air on either side of the window acts as an insulator, and
normally the major part of the temperature drop between the inside and outside of
the house takes place acros
