 dilemma. They postulated that electrons have an intrinsic property, called 
electron spin, that causes each electron to behave as if it were a tiny sphere spinning 
on its own axis.
By now, it may not surprise you to learn that electron spin is quantized. This 
 
observation led to the assignment of a new quantum number for the electron, in 
addition to n, l, and ml, which we have already discussed. This new quantum num-
ber, the spin magnetic quantum number, is denoted ms (the subscript s stands 
for spin). Two possible values are allowed for ms, +1
2 or -1
2, which were first interpreted 
as indicating the two opposite directions in which the electron can spin. A spinning 
charge produces a magnetic field. The two opposite directions of spin therefore pro-
duce oppositely directed magnetic fields (Figure 6.26).* These two opposite magnetic 
fields lead to the splitting of spectral lines into closely spaced pairs.
Electron spin is crucial for understanding the electronic structures o
