 8.2-megapixel camera has a detector with 8,200,000 pixels
(individual “picture elements”).
In common usage,
is called 1micron.
Systems of Units
When dealing with the laws and equations of physics it is very important to use a
consistent set of units. Several systems of units have been in use over the years.
Today the most important is the Système International (French for International
System), which is abbreviated SI. In SI units, the standard of length is the meter,
the standard for time is the second, and the standard for mass is the kilogram.
This system used to be called the MKS (meter-kilogram-second) system.
A second metric system is the cgs system, in which the centimeter, gram, and
second are the standard units of length, mass, and time, as abbreviated in the title.
The British engineering system (although more used in the U.S. than Britain) has 
as its standards the foot for length, the pound for force, and the second for time.
We use SI units almost exclusively in this book
