ature are 
those derived from the porphine molecule (Figure 23.13). This mol-
ecule can coordinate to a metal via its four nitrogen donor atoms. 
Once porphine bonds to a metal ion, the two H atoms on the 
nitrogens are displaced to form complexes called porphyrins. 
Two important porphyrins are hemes, in which the metal ion is 
Fe(II), and chlorophylls, with a Mg(II) central ion.
Figure 23.14 shows a schematic structure of myoglobin, a 
protein that contains one heme group. Myoglobin is a globular 
protein, one that folds into a compact, roughly spherical shape. 
Myoglobin is found in the cells of skeletal muscle, particularly in 
seals, whales, and porpoises. It stores oxygen in cells, one mole-
cule of O2 per myoglobin, until it is needed for metabolic activ-
ities. Hemoglobin, the protein that transports oxygen in human 
blood, is made up of four heme-containing subunits, each of 
which is very similar to myoglobin. One hemoglobin can bind up 
to four O2 molecules.
In both myoglobi
