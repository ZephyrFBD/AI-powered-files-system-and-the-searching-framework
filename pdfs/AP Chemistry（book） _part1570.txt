s maintained at constant temperature and pressure  
is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas.
That is,
 
V = constant * n or  V
n = constant 
[10.4]
where n is number of moles. Thus, for instance, doubling the number of moles of gas 
causes the volume to double if T and P remain constant.
Give It Some Thought
Does the volume of a fixed quantity of gas decrease to half its original value when 
the temperature is lowered from 100 °C to 50 °C?

10.4 ∣ The Ideal-Gas Equation
All three laws we just examined were obtained by holding two of the four variables P, V, 
T, and n constant and seeing how the remaining two variables affect each other. We can 
express each law as a proportionality relationship. Using the symbol ∝ for “is propor-
tional to,” we have
Boyle>s law: 
 
V ∝1
P 1constant n, T2
Charles>s law:  
V ∝T 1constant n, P2
Avogadro>s law:  
V ∝n 1constant P, T2
We can combine these relationships into a general gas law:
