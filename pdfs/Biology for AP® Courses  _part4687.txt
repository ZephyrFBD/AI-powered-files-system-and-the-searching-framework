CHAPTER SUMMARY
37.1 Ecology for Ecosystems
Ecosystems exist on land, at sea, in the air, and underground. Different ways of modeling ecosystems are necessary to
understand how environmental disturbances will affect ecosystem structure and dynamics. Conceptual models are useful
to show the general relationships between organisms and the flow of materials or energy between them. Analytical models
are used to describe linear food chains, and simulation models work best with holistic food webs.

Organisms in an ecosystem acquire en
