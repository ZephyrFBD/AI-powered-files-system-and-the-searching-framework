The purple color of MnO4− 
remains because C2O42− is 
completely consumed.
The purple color of MnO4− 
disappears immediately as 
reaction with C2O42− occurs.

CHAPTER 20 Electrochemistry
Now there are equal numbers of each type of atom on the two sides of the equation, but 
the charge still needs to be balanced. The charge of the reactants is 811+2 + 111-2 = 7+, 
and that of the products is 112+2 + 4102 = 2+. To balance the charge, we add five elec-
trons to the reactant side (Step 2d):
 
5 e- + 8 H+1aq2 + MnO4
-1aq2 ¡ Mn2+1aq2 + 4 H2O1l2 
We can use oxidation states to check our result. In this half-reaction, Mn goes from the 
+7 oxidation state in MnO4
- to the +2 oxidation state of Mn2+. Therefore, each Mn atom 
gains five electrons, in agreement with our balanced half-reaction.
In the oxalate half-reaction, we have
