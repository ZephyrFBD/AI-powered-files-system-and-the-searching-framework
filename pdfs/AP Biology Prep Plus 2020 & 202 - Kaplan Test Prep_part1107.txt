A female mouse carrying a normal and a mutant copy of gene A (A+Am)
was mated to a male mouse carrying a normal and a mutant copy of gene
B (B+Bm), and the oﬀspring followed the inheritance pattern predicted by
Mendel’s law of segregation (leȇ side). However, when a B+Bm female was
mated to an A+Am male, the oﬀspring showed irregular segregation (right
side).
Which of the following is the most reasonable explanation for the
irregular segregation?
