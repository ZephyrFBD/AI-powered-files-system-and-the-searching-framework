xternal pressure is 4.0 atm. What 
is the solubility of N2 from air in blood at this pressure? 
 
(c) If a scuba diver suddenly surfaces from this depth, how 
many milliliters of N2 gas, in the form of tiny bubbles, are 
released into the bloodstream from each liter of blood?
 
[13.108] Consider the following values for enthalpy of vaporiza-
tion 1kJ>mol2 of several organic substances:
CH3CCH3
32.0
O
Acetone
H2C
CH2
28.5
O
Ethylene oxide
CH3C
H
30.4
O
Acetaldehyde
H2C
CH2
CH2
24.7
Cyclopropane
 
 
(a) Account for the variations in heats of vaporiza-
tion for these substances, considering their relative 
intermolecular forces. (b) How would you expect the solu-
bilities of these substances to vary in hexane as solvent? In 
ethanol? Use intermolecular forces, including hydrogen- 
bonding interactions where applicable, to explain your 
responses.
