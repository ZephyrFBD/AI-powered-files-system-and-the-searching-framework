gation takes place. After the reaction is over, electrophoresis is performed. Even
a difference in length of a single base can be detected. The sequence is read from a laser scanner. For his work on DNA
sequencing, Sanger received a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1980.
Sanger’s genome sequencing has led to a race to sequence human genomes at a rapid speed and low cost, often
referred to as the $1000 in one day sequence. Learn more by selecting the Sequencing at Speed animation here

Explain how fast DNA sequencing can change the way doctors treat disease.
a.
Faster genetic sequencing will help in quick analysis of the genetic makeup of bacteria that can cause
diseases in humans for better and more efficient treatments. Also, sequencing of a cancerous cell’s DNA can
provide better ways to treat or prevent cancer.
b.
Fast DNA sequencing can help us quickly analyze the genetic information of existing only bacteria (not new
strains) only that ca
