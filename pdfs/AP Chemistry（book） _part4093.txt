+1aq2 + OH-1aq2. 
Ammonia, 
NH3, acts as an Arrhenius base because it increases the concentration 
of hydroxide ion, OH-, in aqueous solution. It acts like a Brønsted-
Lowry base because it is a proton, H+, acceptor. It acts like a Lewis 
base because it is an electron pair donor. 16.95 (a) Acid, Fe(ClO4)3 or

charge  16.101 K = 3.3 * 107 16.106 pH = 7.01 (not 5.40, from the 
typical calculation, which does not make sense.) Usually we assume 
that 3H+4 and 3OH-4 from the autoionization of water do not con-
tribute to the overall 3H+4 and3OH-4. However, for acid or base sol-
ute concentrations less than 1 * 10-6 M, the autoionization of water 
produces signiﬁcant 3H+4 and 3OH-4 and we must consider it when 
calculating pH. 16.109 (a) pKb = 9.16 (b) pH = 3.07 (c) pH = 8.77
