on the tree. In addition, the ants crop any neighboring vegetation that makes contact with the tree, thereby providing
growing space and sunlight for the acacia.
Lichens, symbiotic associations of fungi and algae, are often cited as examples of mutualism. The algae supply
sugars produced from photosynthesis, and the fungi provide minerals, water, a place to attach, and protection from
herbivores and from ultraviolet radiation. In some cases, however, fungal hyphae invade and kill some of their
symbiotic algae cells. For this and other reasons, some researchers consider the lichen symbiosis closer to
parasitism.
Termites harbor protists and bacteria for a mutualistic association, where termites supply wood (mostly cellulose) to
the microbes in exchange for the breakdown of that wood. Protists are single-celled, eukaryotic organisms living
inside the digestive tract of the termite, while the bacteria, living on or inside the protists, produce various
cellulases, enzymes that break down
