ery early
age. This is because of the energy tradeoff these organisms have made to maximize their evolutionary fitness. Because their
energy is used for producing offspring instead of parental care, it makes sense that these offspring have some ability to be
able to move within their environment and find food and perhaps shelter. Even with these abilities, their small size makes
them extremely vulnerable to predation, so the production of many offspring allows enough of them to survive to maintain
the species.
Animal species that have few offspring during a reproductive event usually give extensive parental care, devoting much of
their energy budget to these activities, sometimes at the expense of their own health. This is the case with many mammals,
such as humans, kangaroos, and pandas. The offspring of these species are relatively helpless at birth and need to develop
before they achieve self-sufficiency.
Plants with low fecundity produce few energy-rich seeds (such as coconuts and
