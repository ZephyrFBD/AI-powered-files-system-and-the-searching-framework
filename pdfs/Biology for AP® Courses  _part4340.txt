Table 36.1 This life table of Ovis dalli shows the number of deaths, number of survivors, mortality rate,
and life expectancy at each age interval for the Dall mountain sheep.
Survivorship Curves
Another tool used by population ecologists is a survivorship curve, which is a graph of the number of individuals surviving
at each age interval plotted versus time (usually with data compiled from a life table). These curves allow us to compare the
life histories of different populations (Figure 36.6). Humans and most primates exhibit a Type I survivorship curve because
a high percentage of offspring survive their early and middle yearsâ€”death occurs predominantly in older individuals. These
types of species usually have small numbers of offspring at one time, and they give a high amount of parental car
