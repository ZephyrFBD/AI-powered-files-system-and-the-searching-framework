rbons have at least one planar ring 
with delocalized p electrons.
 24.4 ▶  Organic Functional Groups  
Recognize that a central organizing principle 
of organic chemistry is the functional group, 
a group of atoms at which most of the 
compound’s chemical reactions occur.
 24.5 ▶  Chirality in Organic Chemistry  
Learn that compounds with 
nonsuperimposable mirror images are chiral 
and that chirality plays important roles in 
organic and biological chemistry.
 24.6 ▶  Introduction to Biochemistry Learn 
about the chemistry of living organisms, 
known as biochemistry, biological chemistry, 
or chemical biology. Important classes of 
compounds that occur in living systems are 
proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic 
acids.
 24.7 ▶  Proteins See that proteins are polymers 
of amino acids linked with amide (also 
called peptide) bonds. Proteins are used 
by organisms for structural support, as 
molecular transporters and as catalysts for 
biochemical reactions.
