arbons of deoxyribose or ribose. DNA
has a deoxyribose sugar backbone while RNA has a ribose backbone.
RNA also contains the nitrogenous base uracil instead of thymine. Both
strands of complementary DNA serve as templates for duplication during
mitosis and meiosis, whereas only one strand serves as a template for
transcription. The simple sugar-phosphate backbone allows for exact
copies of itself to be reproduced during propagation.
There are only four diﬀerent nitrogenous bases that make up the
nucleotides in DNA: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. These
bases pair along complementary strands of DNA. Guanine pairs with
cytosine, and thymine pairs with adenine. In RNA, thymine is replaced
with uracil, which pairs with adenine. Therefore, four diﬀerent
nucleotides form a code for protein synthesis in all of the organisms that
have ever existed on Earth. It is amazing that the combination of
nitrogenous bases in the DNA of all organisms on Earth leads to such
genetic variety.
