hich is then extended by DNA polymerase as it adds nucleotides one by one to the
growing chain. The leading strand is synthesized continuously, whereas the lagging strand is synthesized in short stretches
called Okazaki fragments. The RNA primers are replaced with DNA nucleotides; the DNA remains one continuous strand
by linking the DNA fragments with DNA ligase. The ends of the chromosomes pose a problem as polymerase is unable to
extend them without a primer. Telomerase, an enzyme with an inbuilt RNA template, extends the ends by copying the
RNA template and extending one end of the chromosome. DNA polymerase can then extend the DNA using the primer. In
this way, the ends of the chromosomes are protected.
14.6 DNA Repair
DNA polymerase can make mistakes while adding nucleotides. It edits the DNA by proofreading every newly added base.
Incorrect bases are removed and replaced by the correct base, and then a new base is added. Most mistakes are corrected
during replication, although wh
