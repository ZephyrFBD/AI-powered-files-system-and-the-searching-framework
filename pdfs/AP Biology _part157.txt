The kinetochore is the structural component of the chromosome at which
microtubules of the spindle attach. It has been established that during
anaphase, microtubules that connect the kinetochore to the poles lose
subunits and shorten. Scientists acknowledge two possible theories about
the role of the kinetochore in this spindle shortening. The first is that the
kinetochore is pulling on the spindle fibers (like reeling in a fish),
dragging passive chromosomes to the poles. An opposing theory suggests

that kinetochores actively “walk” on the m
