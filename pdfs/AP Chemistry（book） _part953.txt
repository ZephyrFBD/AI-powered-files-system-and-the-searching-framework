ike s orbitals, p orbitals increase in size as we 
move from 2p to 3p to 4p, and so forth.

Each p orbital has what is called a nodal plane, a plane or sheet where the 
probability density goes to zero. For which of the orbitals below is the yz 
plane a nodal plane?

along which the orbital lies.
The d and f Orbitals
When n is 3 or greater, we encounter the d orbitals 1for which l = 22. There are five 3d 
orbitals, five 4d orbitals, and so forth, because in each shell there are five possible val-
ues for the ml quantum number: -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. The different d orbitals in a given 
shell have different shapes and orientations in space, as shown in Figure 6.24. Four of 
the d-orbital contour representations have a “four-leaf clover” shape, with fou
