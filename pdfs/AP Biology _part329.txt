Figure 9.9 The Genetic Code
Remember this important statement about the genetic code: There are
redundancies in the code, but there is no ambiguity. Examine the chart.
The fact that there are four codons for leucine means there is redundancy.
In every case, one codon codes for one particular amino acid. So there is
no ambiguity.
With very few exceptions within bacteria, mitochondria, and
chloroplasts, this code is universal and unifies all life. It indicates that the
code originated early in the evolution of life on Earth and that all living
things descended from those first ancestral cells.
GENE MUTATION
Mutations are permanent changes in genetic material. They occur
spontaneously and randomly. They can be caused by mutagenic agents,
