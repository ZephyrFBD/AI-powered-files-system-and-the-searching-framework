Like the rest of the plant, the stem has three tissue systems: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue. Each is distinguished by
characteristic cell types that perform specific tasks necessary for the plantâ€™s growth and survival.
Dermal Tissue
The dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis, a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying
tissue. Woody plants have a tough, waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark, which further protects
the plant from damage. Epidermal cells are the most numerous and least differentiated of the cells in the epidermis. The
epidermis of a leaf also contains openings known as stomata, through which the exchange of gases takes place (Figure

the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen and wat
