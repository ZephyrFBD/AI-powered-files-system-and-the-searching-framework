eded to maintain Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
6. Non-random Mating—individuals mating with those in close vicinity. Non-random mating directly
contrasts with the random mating postulate needed to maintain Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
7. Natural Selection—reproductive success of organisms depends on their ability to adapt to the
environment in which they reside. Natural selection directly contrasts with the no natural selection
postulate needed to maintain Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Keep in mind that any genetic variation within a population can increase that population’s
genetic diversity, even within the same species.
Some phenotypic variations can significantly increase or decrease the fitness of an organism
and the overall population.
Examples include DDT resistance in insects, the peppered moth, and sickle cell anemia.
Humans can also impact other species through: loss of genetic diversity within a crop species,
overuse of antibiotics, and artificial selection.
D. Speciation—the ori
