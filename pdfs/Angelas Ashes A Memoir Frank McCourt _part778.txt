ns from van delivery and wants to know why 
 
 all the magazines aren’t counted out,bundled and ready to go.Peter tells 
 
 him,We were busy teaching the new boy, McCourt. God help us, he 
 
 was a bit slow with the bad eyes you know but we kept at him and now 
 
 he’s getting faster. 
 
 Gerry Halvey, the messenger boy, won’t be in for a week because 
 
 he’s entitled to his holidays and he wants to spend the time with his 
 
 girlfriend, Rose, who’s coming back from England. I’m the new boy 
 
 and I have to be messenger boy while he’s gone, cycling around Limerick 
 
 on the bicycle with the big metal basket in front. He shows me 
 
 how to balance papers and magazines so that the bicycle won’t tip 
 
 over with me in the saddle and a lorry passing by that will run over me 
 
 and leave me like a piece of salmon in the road. He saw a soldier once 
 
 that was run over by an army lorry and that’s what he looked like, 
 
 salmon. 
 
 Gerry is making a last delivery at Easons kiosk at
