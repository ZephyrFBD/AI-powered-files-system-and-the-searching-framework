ms is best supported by the data? 
(A) A falling glucagon level causes a rise in the 
insulin level, which maintains equal 
amounts of both hormones in the blood. 
(B) A high glucagon level causes a rise in the 
insulin level, which maintains high levels  
of both hormones in the blood. 
(C) A low glucose level causes the release of 
glucagon, which stimulates the release of 
more glucose from tissues, which in turn 
lowers the amount of glucagon being 
released. 
(D) A low glucose level causes the release of 
insulin, which stimulates the release of 
more glucose from tissues, which in turn 
increases the amount of insulin being 
released. 
 
 
 
49. Which of the following best describes an 
advantage that eukaryote organisms have over 
prokaryote organisms? 
(A) Prokaryotes lack a cell membrane and 
therefore are unable to control what enters 
or exits the cell. 
(B) Eukaryotes have a nuclear envelope 
separating their DNA from the rest of the 
cell, which increases the likelihood of
