he sandwich have been broken down into smaller nutrient molecules, including
amino acids, glucose, and fatty acids, they are absorbed from the small intestine into the circulatory and lymphatic systems.
The walls of the small intestine contain small, finger-like projections called villi and microvilli that increase surface area
for absorption of nutrients by diffusion. The large intestine or colon does not produce digestive enzymes but functions to
absorb water, salts, and some vitamins. Any nutrients from the sandwich are stored in the liver, and wastes are eliminated.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 and Big Idea 4
of the AP速 Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP速 exam questions. A Learning Objective merges required content wi
