tery is continually pulling electrons off the p end, forming new holes,
and electrons are being supplied by the negative terminal at the n end.
When the diode is reverse biased, as in Fig. 29–29b, the holes in the p end are
attracted to the battery’s negative terminal and the electrons in the n end are
attracted to the positive terminal. Almost no current carriers meet near the
junction and, ideally, no current flows.
