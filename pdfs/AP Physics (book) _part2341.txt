P = 400 turns
A transformer operates only on ac. A dc current in the primary coil does not
produce a changing flux and therefore induces no emf in the secondary. How-
ever, if a dc voltage is applied to the primary through a switch, at the instant the
switch is opened or closed there will be an induced voltage in the secondary. For
example, if the dc is turned on and off as shown in Fig. 21–24a, the voltage
induced in the secondary is as shown in Fig. 21–24b. Notice that the secondary
voltage drops to zero when the dc voltage is steady. This is basically how, in the
ignition system of an automobile, the high voltage is created to produce the spark
across the gap of a spark plug that ignites the gas-air mixture. The transformer is
referred to as an “ignition coil,” and transforms the 12 V dc of the battery (whe
