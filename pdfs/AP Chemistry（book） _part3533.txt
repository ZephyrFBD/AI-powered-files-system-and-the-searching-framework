en in this oxidation state are 
called oxides.
Nonmetals form covalent oxides, most of which are simple molecules with low melt-
ing and boiling points. Both SiO2 and B2O3, however, have extended structures. Most 
nonmetal oxides combine with water to give oxyacids. Sulfur dioxide 1SO22, for example, 
dissolves in water to give sulfurous acid 1H2SO32:
 
SO21g2 + H2O1l2 ¡ H2SO31aq2 
[22.23]
This reaction and that of SO3 with H2O to form H2SO4 are largely responsible for acid 
rain. 
 (Section 18.2) The analogous reaction of CO2 with H2O to form carbonic acid 
1H2CO32 causes the acidity of carbonated water.
Oxides that form acids when they react with water are called either acidic anhy-
drides (anhydride means “without water”) or acidic oxides. A few nonmetal oxides, 
especially ones with the nonmetal in a low oxidation state—such as N2O, NO, and CO
—do not react with water and are not acidic anhydrides.
