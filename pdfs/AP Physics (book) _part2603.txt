 a concave mirror (radius 21.0 cm) must an
object be placed if its image is to be at infinity?
10. (II) A small candle is 38 cm from a concave mirror having
a radius of curvature of 24 cm. (a) What is the focal length
of the mirror? (b) Where will the image of the candle be
located? (c) Will the image be upright or inverted?
11. (II) An object 3.0 mm high is placed 16 cm from a convex
mirror of radius of curvature 16 cm. (a) Show by ray tracing
that the image is virtual, and estimate the image distance.
(b) Show that the (negative) image distance can be computed
from Eq. 23–2 using a focal length of 
(c) Compute
the image size, using Eq. 23–3.
12. (II) A dentist wants a small mirror that, when 2.00 cm from
a tooth, will produce a
upright image. What kind of
mirror must be used and what must its radius of curvature be?
13. (II) You are standing 3.4 m from a convex security mirror
in a store. You estimate the height of your image to be half
of your actual height. Estimate the radius of c
