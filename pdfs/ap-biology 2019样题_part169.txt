ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.K.1
DNA, and in some cases RNA, is the primary 
source of heritable information.
IST-1.K.2
Genetic information is transmitted from one 
generation to the next through DNA or RNA—
a. Genetic information is stored in and 
passed to subsequent generations through 
DNA molecules and, in some cases, 
RNA molecules.
b. Prokaryotic organisms typically have circular 
chromosomes, while eukaryotic organisms 
typically have multiple linear chromosomes.
IST-1.K.3
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes can contain 
plasmids, which are small extra-chromosomal, 
double-stranded, circular DNA molecules.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
