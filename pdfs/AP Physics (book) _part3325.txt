red LEDs were first developed. Approximately what
energy gaps would you expect to find in green (525 nm)
and in blue (465 nm) LEDs?
Eg = 1.12 eV?
51. Consider a monatomic solid with a weakly bound cubic 
lattice, with each atom connected to six neighbors, each bond
having a binding energy of 
When this solid
melts, its latent heat of fusion goes directly into breaking
the bonds between the atoms. Estimate the latent heat of
fusion for this solid, in 
[Hint: Show that in a simple
cubic lattice (Fig.29–44), there are three times as many bonds
as there are atoms, when the number of atoms is large.]

1. Explain why metals are shiny. (See Section 29–5.)
2. Compare the potential energy diagram for an 
molecule
with the potential energy diagram for ATP formation from
ADP and 
. Explain the significance of the difference in
shapes of the two diagrams. (See Section 29–2.)
