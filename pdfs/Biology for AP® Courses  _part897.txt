What is Structure X in the graphic?
a.
the inner mitochondrial membrane
b.
the mitochondrial matrix
c.
a eukaryotic plasma membrane
d.
the cytosol
48.
What would be the most direct result of blocking structure
Z in the graphic?
a.
Cytochrome c would not pass electrons from
complex III to complex IV.
b.
Ubiquinone would not pass electrons from
complex III to complex IV.
c.
NADH would not be converted to NAD+
and the electron transport chain would stop.
d.
No protons would be pumped across the
membrane.
49.
Where do the electrons moving along the membrane in the
figure come from, and where do the electrons end up?
a.
The electrons are released by NADH and
FADH2 and finally accepted by oxygen to
form water.
b.
The electrons are given off by water and finally
accepted by NAD+
and FAD+
to produce
the energy currencies NADH and FADH2 .
c.
The electrons are emitted by ubiquinone that are,
in turn, transferred from complex I to complex
II. Water finally accepts the electrons.
d.
The elect
