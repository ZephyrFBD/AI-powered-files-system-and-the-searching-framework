of evolution by
natural selection:
Individuals vary in their characteristics within a population. This
means that all giraﬀes have long necks, but their necks aren’t all the
exact same length.
1.
The variations observed in populations are inherited. When a big dog
has puppies, they tend to be big, and a little dog’s puppies tend to be
little.
2.
A considerable number of individuals in a population seem to die as
they compete for limited resources in the environment. This is where
the term “survival of the fittest” emerged; “fit” organisms are simply
the ones that don’t die oﬀ, those with characteristics that make them
more likely to survive to reproductive age within their specific
environments. These characteristics could include being bigger or
stronger, but they also could include being smaller and smarter—what
counts as fitness depends on the environment and the role that the
organism plays within it.

characteristic
