(a) Describe the factors that influence an individual’s phenotype. 
(b) Explain how the presence of Notonecta chemical cues affects gene expression in the Daphnia. 
(c) As a follow‑up experiment, researchers placed the Daphnia that were exposed to the Notonecta chemical 
cues into a tank without chemical cues. The Daphnia reproduced asexually, and the offspring developed in the 
tank without chemical cues. Predict the relative size of the crest height and width of offspring raised in the 
tank without chemical cues as compared to the parent Daphnia. 
(d) Provide reasoning to justify your prediction in part (c).
