tralization reaction is:
H3PO31aq2 + 2 NaOH1aq2 ¡  Na2HPO31aq2 + 2 H2O1l2
 
From the deﬁnition of molarity, M = mol>L, we see that 
moles = M * L.  
 (Section 4.5) Thus, the number of 
moles of NaOH added to the solution is:
10.0233 L210.102 mol>L2 = 2.38 * 10-3 mol NaOH
 
The balanced equation indicates that 2 mol of NaOH is con-
sumed for each mole of H3PO3. Thus, the number of moles of 
H3PO3 in the sample is:
12.38 * 10-3 mol NaOH2a
1 mol H3PO3
2 mol NaOH b = 1.19 * 10-3 mol H3PO3
 
The concentration of the H3PO3 solution, therefore, equals 
11.19 * 10-3 mol2>10.0250 L2 = 0.0476 M.
(c) From the pH of the solution, 1.59, we can calculate 3H+4 at 
equilibrium:
3H+4 = antilog1-1.592 = 10-1.59 = 0.026 M 1two significant figures2
 
Because Ka1 W Ka2, the vast majority of the ions in  
solution are from the ﬁrst ionization step of the acid.
 
Because one H2PO3
- ion forms for each H+ ion formed, 
the equilibrium concentrations of H+ and H2PO3
- are 
equal: 3H+4 = 3H2PO3 
-4 = 0.026 M. Th
