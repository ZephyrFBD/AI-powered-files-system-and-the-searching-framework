CHAPTER SUMMARY
19.1 Population Evolution
The modern synthesis of evolutionary theory grew out of the cohesion of Darwin’s, Wallace’s, and Mendel’s thoughts on
evolution and heredity, along with the more modern study of population genetics. It describes the evolution of populations
and species, from small-scale changes among individuals to large-scale changes over paleontological time periods. To
understand how organisms evolve, scientists can track populations’ allele frequencies over time. If they differ from
generation to gene
