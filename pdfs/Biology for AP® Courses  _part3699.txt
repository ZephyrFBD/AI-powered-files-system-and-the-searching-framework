The plasma component of blood without the coagulation factors is called the serum. Serum is similar to interstitial fluid in
which the correct composition of key ions acting as electrolytes is essential for normal functioning of muscles and nerves.
Other components in the serum include proteins that assist with maintaining pH and osmotic balance while giving viscosity
to the blood. The serum also contains antibodies, specialized proteins that are important for defense against viruses and
bacteria. Lipids, including cholesterol, are also transported in the serum, along with various other substances including
