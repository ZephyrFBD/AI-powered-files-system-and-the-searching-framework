eactions of
photosynthesis. Like plant cells, photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts. Some bacteria perform photosynthesis, but
their chlorophyll is not relegated to an organelle.
Endosymbiosis
We have mentioned that both mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA and ribosomes. Have you
wondered why? Strong evidence points to endosymbiosis as the explanation.
Symbiosis is a relationship in which organisms from two separate species depend on each other for their
survival. Endosymbiosis (endo- = “within”) is a mutually beneficial relationship in which one organism lives
inside the other. Endosymbiotic relationships abound in nature. We have already mentioned that microbes
that produce vitamin K live inside the human gut. This relationship is beneficial for us because we are
unable to synthesize vitamin K. It is also beneficial for the microbes because they are protected from other
organisms and from drying out, and they receive abundant food from the environment of the large inte
