5 times the BMR. The diet of an endothermic animal is
determined by its BMR. For example: the type of grasses, leaves, or shrubs that an herbivore eats affects the number of
calories that it takes in. The relative caloric content of herbivore foods, in descending order, is tall grasses > legumes > short
grasses > forbs (any broad-leaved plant, not a grass) > subshrubs > annuals/biennials.
Energy Requirements Related to Environment
Animals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor. Torpor is a process that leads to a decrease in
activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions. Torpor can be used by animals for long periods,
such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months, in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body
temperature. During hibernation, ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of 0° C (32° F), while a bear’s
internal temperature is maintained higher at about 37° C (99° F).
