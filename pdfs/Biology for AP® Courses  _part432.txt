ion of chromatin where ribosome synthesis occurs. The boundary of the nucleus is
called the nuclear envelope. It consists of two phospholipid bilayers: an outer membrane and an inner membrane. The
nuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum. Nuclear pores allow substances to enter and exit the
nucleus.
The Nuclear Envelope
The nuclear envelope is a double-membrane structure that constitutes the outermost portion of the nucleus (Figure 4.11).
Both the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are phospholipid bilayers.
The nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions, molecules, and RNA between the
nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. The nucleoplasm is the semi-solid fluid inside the nucleus, where we find the chromatin and
the nucleolus.
Chromatin and Chromosomes
To understand chromatin, it is helpful to first consider chromosomes. Chromosomes are structures within the nucleus that
are made up of DNA, the hereditary material. You may remem
