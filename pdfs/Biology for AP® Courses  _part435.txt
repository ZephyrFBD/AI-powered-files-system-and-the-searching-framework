large and small (Figure 4.13). Ribosomes receive their
“orders” for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA
travels to the ribosomes, which translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a
specific order of amino acids in a protein. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
Figure 4.13 Ribosomes are made up of a large subunit (top) and a small subunit (bottom). During protein synthesis,
ribosomes assemble amino acids into proteins.
Because protein synthesis is an essential function of all cells (including enzymes, hormones, antibodies, pigments, structural
components, and surface receptors), ribosomes are found in practically every cell. Ribosomes are particularly abundant
in cells that synthesize large amounts of protein. For example, the pancreas is responsible for creating several digestive
enzymes and the cells that produce these enzymes contain many ribosomes. Thus, we see ano
