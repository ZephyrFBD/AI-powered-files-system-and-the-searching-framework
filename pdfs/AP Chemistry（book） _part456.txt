indicate that two molecules of H2 react with one molecule of O2 to form two  
molecules of 
H2O. It follows that the relative numbers of moles are identical to the relative numbers of 
molecules:

We can generalize this observation to all balanced chemical equations: The coefficients in a 
balanced chemical equation indicate both the relative numbers of molecules (or formula units) in 
the reaction and the relative numbers of moles. Figure 3.15 shows how this result corresponds 
to the law of conservation of mass.
 
Because all of the hydrogen in the sample is converted to H2O, we can use dimensional analysis and the following steps to calculate the mass 
H in the sample. We use three significant figures for the atomic mass of H to match the significant figures in the mass of H2O produced.
