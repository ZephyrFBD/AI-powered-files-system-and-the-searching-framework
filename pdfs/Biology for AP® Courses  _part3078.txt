ype of postsynaptic glutamate receptor, called NMDA (N-
Methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, shown in Figure 26.18. These receptors are normally blocked by magnesium ions; however,
when the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized by multiple presynaptic inputs in quick succession (either from one neuron
or multiple neurons), the magnesium ions are forced out allowing Ca2+ ions to pass into the postsynaptic cell. Next,
Ca2+ ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes a different type of glutamate receptor, called AMPA
(Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors, to be inserted into the postsynaptic membrane, since
activated AMPA receptors allow positive ions to enter the cell. So, the next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic
membrane, it will have a larger excitatory effect (EPSP) on the postsynaptic cell because the binding of glutamate to these
AMPA receptors will allow more positive ions into the cell. The insertion of additional AMPA recepto
