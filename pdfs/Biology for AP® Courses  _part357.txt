of nucleotides that direct cellular activities such as cell division and protein
synthesis. Each nucleotide is made up of a pentose sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. There are two types
of nucleic acids: DNA and RNA. DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell and is passed on from parents to offspring
(in the form of chromosomes). It has a double-helical structure with the two strands running in opposite directions,
connected by hydrogen bonds, and complementary to each other. RNA is single-stranded and is made of a pentose sugar
(ribose), a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. RNA is involved in protein synthesis and its regulation. Messenger

RNA (mRNA) is copied from the DNA, is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and contains information for the
construction of proteins. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a part of the ribosomes at the site of
