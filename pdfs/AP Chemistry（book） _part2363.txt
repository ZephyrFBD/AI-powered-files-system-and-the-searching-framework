quilibrium  
Examine reversible reactions and the 
concept of equilibrium.
 15.2 ▶ The Equilibrium Constant Define 
the equilibrium constant based on rates of 
forward and reverse reactions, and learn how 
to write equilibrium-constant expressions for 
homogeneous reactions.
 15.3 ▶ Understanding and Working with 
Equilibrium Constants Learn how to 
interpret the magnitude of an equilibrium 
constant and how its value depends on the 
way the corresponding chemical equation is 
expressed.
 15.4 ▶  Heterogeneous Equilibria Write 
equilibrium-constant expressions for 
heterogeneous reactions.
 15.5 ▶ Calculating Equilibrium 
Constants Calculate equilibrium 
constants from the equilibrium 
concentrations of reactants and products.
 15.6 ▶ Applications of Equilibrium 
Constants Use equilibrium constants 
to predict equilibrium concentrations of 
reactants and products and to determine the 
direction in which a reaction mixture must 
proceed to achieve equilibrium.
