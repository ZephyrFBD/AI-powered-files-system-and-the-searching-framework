ical area. (B) is incorrect because distinct populations can
look very similar while still being separate species. (D) is incorrect

Although there is a lot of data in the table, the only relevant
information concerns the comparison of yeast, a fungus, to other
species. The table shows that yeast has fewer base substitutions in
comparison to animal species (fruit flies, sea urchins, rats, and
humans) than in comparison to plant species (soybeans and maize).
Thus, the classification of Fungi as distinct from Plantae is appropriate
and (C) is correct. (A) is incorrect because yeast are more closely
related to humans than to maize, based on the table. (B) is incorrect
because yeast are more closely related to animal species than to
soybeans. (D) is incorrect because the revision was appropriate.
