a name independent of all oth-
ers. Many important substances that have been known for a long time, such as water 
1H2O2 and ammonia 1NH32, do have traditional names (called common names). For 
most substances, however, we rely on a set of rules that leads to an informative and 
unique name that conveys the composition of the substance.
The rules for chemical nomenclature are based on the division of substances into 
categories. The major division is between organic and inorganic compounds. Organic 
compounds contain carbon and hydrogen, often in combination with oxygen, nitrogen, 
or other elements. All others are inorganic compounds. Early chemists associated organic 
compounds with plants and animals and inorganic compounds with the nonliving por-
tion of our world. Although this distinction is no longer pertinent, the classification 
between organic and inorganic compounds continues to be useful. In this section, we 
consider the basic rules for naming three categories of inorganic
