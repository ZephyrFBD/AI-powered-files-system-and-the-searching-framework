t images of
nearby objects can be focused on the retina, behind the new focal point. This
focusing adjustment is called accommodation.
The closest distance at which the eye can focus clearly is called the near point
of the eye. For young adults it is typically 25 cm, although younger children can
often focus on objects as close as 10 cm. As people grow older, the ability to
accommodate is reduced and the near point increases. A given person’s far point
is the farthest distance at which an object can be seen clearly. For some purposes
it is useful to speak of a normal eye (a sort of average over the population),
defined as an eye having a near point of 25 cm and a far point of infinity. To check
your own near point, place this book close to your eye and slowly move it away
until the type is sharp.
The “normal” eye is sort of an ideal. Many people have eyes that do not
accommodate within the “normal” range of 25 cm to infinity, or have some other
defect. Two common defects are nearsighte
