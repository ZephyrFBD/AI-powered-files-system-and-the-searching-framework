e as a relay protein that
initiates a different transduction pathway.
5. Relay protein initiates transduction pathway. The relay proteins, now activated by the addition of a phosphate
group, are released. A relay protein can activate a cellular response or initiate a protein kinase transduction pathway
that leads to a cellular response. Each kind of relay protein participates in a different cellular response.
6. RTK pathway is deactivated by dephosphorylation or receptor protein isolation (not shown in figure). The
RTK pathway is deactivated when dephosphorylating enzymes remove phosphate groups from the kinases or when
the membrane folds to encircle and internalize the receptor protein in a vesicle (endocytosis).
There are two fundamental differences between an RTK receptor pathway and the GPCR pathway discussed earlier:
1. The RTK receptor is usually directly responsible for initiating a transduction pathway. In contrast, the GPCR
indirectly activates a transduction pathway via a G p
