ement is an appropriately
evidence-based refinement of the above?
a.
The process of mutation, which generates
genetic variation, is random. However, the
process of natural selection, which results in
adaptations like the fit between a flower and its
pollinator, favors variants which are better able
to survive and reproduce. Natural selection is not
random, so the overall process of evolution is
not random, either.
b.
The process of mutation, which generates
genetic variation, is random. However, the
process of migration, which results in gene flow
between populations, also generates genetic
variation. Migration is not random, so the
overall process of evolution is not random,
either.
c.
The process of mutation, which generates
genetic variation, is random. However, the
process of sexual reproduction, which also
introduces genetic variance, is not random.
Because sexual reproduction is not random, the
overall process of evolution is not random,
either.
d.
The process of mutation, which
