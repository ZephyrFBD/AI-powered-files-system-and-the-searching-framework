e emf of the cell is derived from a difference 
in the concentrations of the same electrolyte solutions in the 
compartments. (Section 20.6)
condensation polymerization Polymerization in which two 
molecules are joined to form a larger molecule by elimination of 
a small molecule, such as H2O. (Section 12.8)
condensation reaction A reaction in which two molecules 
are joined to form a larger molecule by elimination of a small 
molecule, such as H2O. (Section 12.8)
conduction band A band of unoccupied antibonding molecular 
orbitals lying higher in energy than the occupied valence band 
and distinctly separated from it. (Section 12.7)
conjugate acid A substance formed by addition of a proton to a 
Brønsted–Lowry base. (Section 16.2)
conjugate acid–base pair An acid and a base, such as H2O and 
OH-, that differ only in the presence or absence of a proton. 
(Section 16.2)
conjugate base A substance formed by the loss of a proton from 
a Brønsted–Lowry acid. (Section 16.2)
