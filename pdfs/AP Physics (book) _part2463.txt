CHAPTER 22
Electromagnetic Waves
†The intensity I for EM waves is often called the Poynting vector and given the symbol 
Its direction
is that in which the energy is being transported, which is the direction the wave is traveling, and its
magnitude is the intensity (S = I).
S
B.
The energy a wave transports per unit time per unit area is the intensity I, as
defined in Sections 11–9 and 12–2.† The units of I are 
The energy 
is
the energy density (Eq. 22–6a) times the volume V. Hence the energy passing
through an area A in a time 
(see Fig. 22–11) is
because 
Therefore, the magnitude of the intensity (energy per unit area
per time 
or power per unit area) is
From Eqs. 22–2 and 22–3, this can also be written
(22;7)
We can also find the average intensity over an extended period of time, if E and B
are sinusoidal. Then
, just as for electric cu
