 24.98  An unknown substance is found to contain only carbon 
and hydrogen. It is a liquid that boils at 49 °C at 1 atm pres-
sure. Upon analysis it is found to contain 85.7% carbon 
and 14.3% hydrogen by mass. At 100 °C and 735 torr, the 
vapor of this unknown has a density of 2.21 g>L. When it is 
dissolved in hexane solution and bromine water is added, 
no reaction occurs. What is the identity of the unknown 
compound?
 24.99  The standard free energy of formation of solid glycine 
is -369 kJ>mol, whereas that of solid glycylglycine is 
-488 kJ>mol. What is ∆G° for the condensation of glycine 
to form glycylglycine?
 24.100  A typical amino acid with one amino group and one car-
boxylic acid group, such as serine, can exist in water in 
several ionic forms. (a) Suggest the forms of the amino acid 
at low pH and at high pH. (b) Amino acids generally have 
two pKa values, one in the range of 2 to 3 and the other in 
the range of 9 to 10. Serine, for example, has pKa values of 
2.19 an
