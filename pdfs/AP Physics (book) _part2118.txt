ed to be interpreted. As an illustration of measurement
“theory” we examine here how electrical quantities are measured using meters.
We also examine how meters affect the quantity they attempt to measure.
An ammeter measures current, and a voltmeter measures potential difference
or voltage. Each can be either: (1) an analog meter, which displays numerical
values by the position of a pointer that can move across a scale (Fig. 19–30a); or
(2) a digital meter, which displays the numerical value in numbers (Fig. 19–30b).
We now examine how analog meters work.
An analog ammeter or voltmeter, in which the reading is by a pointer on a scale
(Fig. 19–30a), uses a galvanometer. A galvanometer works on the principle of the
force between a magnetic field and a current-carrying coil of wire; it is straight-
forward to understand and will be discussed in Chapter 20. For now, we only need to
know that the deflection of the needle of a galvanometer is proportional to the current
flowing through it.
