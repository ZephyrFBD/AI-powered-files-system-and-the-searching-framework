CHAPTER SUMMARY
17.1 Biotechnology
Nucleic acids can be isolated from cells for the purposes of further analysis by breaking open the cells and enzymatically
destroying all other major macromolecules. Fragmented or whole chromosomes can be separated on the basis of size by
gel electrophoresis. Short stretches of DNA or RNA can be amplified by PCR. Southern and northern blotting can be used
to detect the presence of specific short sequences in a DNA or RNA sample. The term “cloning” may refer to cloning
small DNA fragments (molecular cloning), cloning cell populations (cellular cloning), or cloning entire organisms
(reproductive cloning). Genetic testing is performed to identify disease-causing genes, and gene therapy is used to cure an
inheritable disease.
Transgenic organisms possess DNA from a different
