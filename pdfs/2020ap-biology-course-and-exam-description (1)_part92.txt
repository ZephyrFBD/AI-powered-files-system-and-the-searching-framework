ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-1.B.2
The surface area of the plasma membrane 
must be large enough to adequately 
exchange materials— 
a.	These limitations can restrict cell size 
and shape. Smaller cells typically have a 
higher surface area-to-volume ratio and 
more efficient exchange of materials with 
the environment.
b.	As cells increase in volume, the relative 
surface area decreases and the demand for 
internal resources increases. 
c.	More complex cellular structures 
(e.g., membrane folds) are necessary 
to adequately exchange materials with 
the environment. 
d.	As organisms increase in size, their surface 
area-to-volume ratio decreases, affecting 
properties like rate of heat exchange with 
the environment.
