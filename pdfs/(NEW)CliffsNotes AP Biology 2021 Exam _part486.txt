trigger plasmolysis (contraction of the
cell away from the cell wall) and a reduction in cell turgor (cell rigidity), followed by wilting. If water continues to
be unavailable, chemical reactions can no longer occur, metabolic activities stop, and cells die.
Fruit Ripening
Ethylene is a gas that promotes the ripening of many kinds of fruits. During the later stages of fruit development,
ethylene gas fills the intercellular air spaces within the fruit and stimulates its ripening by enzymatic breakdown of
cell walls. Fruit ripening is an example of a positive feedback mechanism. As fruit ripens, more and more ethylene
is produced, accelerating the ripening process until the fully ripened product is attained.
Plant Responses to Abiotic Stimuli
Since plants are anchored by their roots, they cannot move in response to environmental stimuli. Instead, they
change their growth pattern, modify their structures, or make other changes in response to abiotic and biotic stimuli.
