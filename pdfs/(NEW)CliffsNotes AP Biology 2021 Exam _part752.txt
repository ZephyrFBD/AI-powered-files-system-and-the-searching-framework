or more generations, you might find that one of
the alleles disappears from that generation (its frequency becomes zero). If one allele disappears, the remaining
allele is said to be “fixed.” Once an allele is fixed in a population, it remains so until some evolutionary process
(mutation or gene flow) reintroduces it.
2. Increase the population size. The fluctuations in gene frequencies that you see from generation to generation are
examples of genetic drift, changes in gene frequencies as a result of chance. The effect of genetic drift decreases as
population size increases, so increasing the size of the population should reduce its effect.
3. Investigate the effect of natural selection. You can simulate the effect of selection for or against one of the
alleles. Selection can influence any of the stages during the life cycle of an individual but ultimately will determine
whether or not that individual will contribute gametes to the next generation. One way to simulate selection is to
