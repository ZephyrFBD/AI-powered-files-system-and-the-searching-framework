The nephron consists of three parts: the renal
corpuscle, the Bowmanâ€™s capsule, and the
associated capillary network originating from
the cortical radiate arteries.

34. How does the loop of Henle act as a countercurrent
multiplier?

a.
The descending limb of the loop of Henle is
water permeable, so the water flows from the
filtrate to the interstitial fluid. Osmolality in the
limb decreases, and it is lower inside the loop
than in the interstitial fluid. As the filtrate enters
the ascending limb, Na+ and Cl- ions exit
through ion channels present in the cell
membrane. Further up, only sodium is passively
