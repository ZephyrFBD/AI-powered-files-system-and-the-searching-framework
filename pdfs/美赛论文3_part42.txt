ssumption will be incorrect, and the strategy will not work. The factors of width
and length are the same as that discussed in shape before.
(2)Suffering degree:
We consider that the impact of volume is the same as the impact of shape on
suffering degree. They both affect the value of E through the area of surface between
water and air.
(3)Wasting water:
Similarly, different volume of bathtub means different area of water surface with
its affect mainly focuses on the heat lose. To promise the time duration and the lowest
temperature of hot water , the more heat loses, the more times we have to add water
into bathtub, which we name this variable as n. On the other hand, the less heat loses,
the less frequency we have to add water. Due to the equation, volume has an impact
on wasted water. However, the demand of wasted water is not very strict, it is only
required to lower than the predetermined upper bound. Accordingly, there is little
influence caused by volume.
(4)Conclusion:
The volu
