d replaced with the
sodium bicarbonate solution. When enough of the air has been replaced with the sodium bicarbonate solution, the
density of the leaf disk increases and it sinks.
The sunken leaf disks are transferred to a beaker that contains sodium bicarbonate solution. When exposed to a
light source, the leaf disks perform photosynthesis: oxygen is produced and replaces the sodium bicarbonate solution
in the spaces between the mesophyll cells. When enough oxygen has been produced, displacing the sodium
bicarbonate solution inside the leaf, the leaf disks float. At one-minute intervals, the number of floating leaf disks is
recorded. The time needed until 50% of the leaf disks float can be used as an indirect assay of the rate of
photosynthesis. A sample data table and a graph of the data (Figure 24.6) follow.
