tly. Most lipids are nonpolar and hydrophobic. Major types
include fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. A typical fat consists of three fatty acids bonded to one molecule
of glycerol, forming triglycerides or triacylglycerols. The fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated, depending on
the presence or absence of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain; a saturated fatty acid has the maximum number
of hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon and, thus, only single bonds. In general, fats that are liquid at room temperature
(e.g., canola oil) tend to be more unsaturated than fats that are solid at room temperature. In the food industry, oils are
artificially hydrogenated to make them chemically more appropriate for use in processed foods. During this hydrogenation
process, double bonds in the cis- conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may be converted to double bonds in the trans-
conformation; unfortunately, trans fats have been shown to contribute to heart disease. Phospholipids a
