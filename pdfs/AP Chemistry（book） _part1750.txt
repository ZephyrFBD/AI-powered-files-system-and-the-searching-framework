e a 1 °C temperature change is greater than the amount 
we must add to achieve a 1 °C temperature change in the same 
mass of ice.
Lines BC and DE show the conversion of one phase to another at a constant tem-
perature. The temperature remains constant during these phase changes because the 
added energy is used to overcome the attractive forces between molecules rather than to 
increase their average kinetic energy. For line BC, the enthalpy change can be calculated 
by using ∆Hfus, and for line DE we can use ∆Hvap.
If we start with 1 mol of steam at 125 °C and cool it, we move right to left across 
Figure 11.22. We first lower the temperature of the H2O1g2 1F ¡ E2, then condense it 
1E ¡ D2 to H2O1l2, and so forth.
Sometimes as we remove heat from a liquid, we can temporarily cool it below its 
freezing point without forming a solid. This phenomenon, called supercooling, occurs 
when the heat is removed so rapidly that the molecules have no time to assume the 
ordered structure of a
