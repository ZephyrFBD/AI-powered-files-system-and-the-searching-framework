■ Lab Reports/Papers 
A formal report, or paper, provides an effective method for students to organize their 
work, and prepares them for doing research papers in scientific journals. A formal report 
would include several elements in addition to the information in the lab notebook, 
such as an introduction that may be prefaced by an abstract, and perhaps a discussion 
before the conclusion. The introduction gives a context for the experiment, and the 
discussion may include information from other sources that pertain to the experiment. 
Advantages of this type of report include the experience in writing clearly, as well as the 
opportunities for students to reflect on their work. Many teachers use a rubric, such as 
the following, for evaluation.
