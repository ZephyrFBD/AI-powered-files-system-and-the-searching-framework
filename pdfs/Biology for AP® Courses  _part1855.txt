ric field. Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate molecules on the basis of size, using this charge.
The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments. The nucleic acids are loaded into a slot near the
negative electrode of a semisolid, porous gel matrix and pulled toward the positive electrode at the opposite end of the gel.
Smaller molecules move through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in the rate of migration
separates the fragments on the basis of size. There are molecular weight standard samples that can be run alongside the
molecules to provide a size comparison. Nucleic acids in a gel matrix can be observed using various fluorescent or colored
dyes. Distinct nucleic acid fragments appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative electrode
end) on the basis of their size (Figure 17.3). A mixture of genomic DNA fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear,
whereas uncut genomic DNA i
