ut photosynthesis. Like the mitochondria, chloroplasts
also have a double-membrane structure. Chloroplasts have a smooth outer membrane and pancake-shaped
membranous sacs called thylakoids that are stacked into structures called grana (singular: granum). The liquid
inside the chloroplast that surrounds the grana is called stroma. (See Figure 5.8.) The membranes of the thylakoids
function in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, and the enzymes in the stroma function in the light-
independent reactions of photosynthesis. These processes will be discussed in detail in Chapter 8. Like
mitochondria, chloroplasts also contain their own chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and their own ribosomes.

The centrosome, as shown in Figure 5.9, is found in animal cells and helps the microtubules assemble into the
spindle fibers needed in cell division. Defects in centrosome function have been associated with dysregulation of the
cell cycle in some cancers.
