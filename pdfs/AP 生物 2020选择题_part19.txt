Certain reef-building corals contain photosynthetic, symbiotic algae that have the ability to make 
dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), a chemical involved in the marine sulfur cycle. DMSP is released into the 
surrounding water, where it is converted to the gas dimethyl sulfide (DMS) by microorganisms and enters the 
atmosphere. Once in the atmosphere, it triggers the formation of sulfate aerosols, which induce cloud formation and 
block sunlight from heating up the water. 
The symbiotic algae produce DMSP when they are stressed by a high water temperature. If water temperature is too 
high, corals will expel the symbiotic algae that produce DMSP. Researchers measured the amount
