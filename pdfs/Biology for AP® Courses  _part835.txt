oth amino acids and triglycerides are broken down for energy through these
pathways. Overall, in living systems, these pathways of glucose catabolism extract about 34 percent of the energy contained
in glucose.

Use construction paper and other art materials to create your own diagram of the electron transport chain
(ETC). Be sure to include all parts of the electron transport chain, as well as the electrons themselves,
NAD+ and NADH, and oxygen. On your diagram, label all parts of the ETC that transfers the free energy
from electrons to another form. Then, use your model to make predictions about each of the following. Then,
share your answers with the class.
a.
What would happen to free energy release if a cytochrome failed to undergo one of the redox reactions
involved in the electron transport chain?
b.
What ultimately happens to the free energy in the electr
