 formal charges must add up to 0 and the formal charge 
on the F atom is +1, there must be another atom that has a formal 
charge of -1. Because F is the most electronegative element, we 
don’t expect it to carry a positive formal charge. page 320 The 
ozone OO bond length should be longer than the OO bond in oxy-
gen. page 321 Weaker. page 322 No, it will not have multiple 
resonance structures. We can’t “move” the double bonds, as we did 
in benzene, because the positions of the hydrogen atoms dictate 
specific positions for the double bonds. We can’t write any other 
reasonable Lewis structures for the molecule. page 323 The for-
mal charge of each atom is shown here:

The ﬁrst structure shows each atom with a zero formal charge and 
therefore it is the dominant Lewis structure. The second one shows a 
positive formal charge for an oxygen atom, which is a highly electro-
negative atom, and this is not a favorable situation.
