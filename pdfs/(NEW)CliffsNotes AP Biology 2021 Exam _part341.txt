5. Transposons (transposable elements, mobile genetic elements, or “jumping genes”) are naturally occurring
mutations. They are DNA segments that insert themselves throughout the genome after copying or deleting
themselves from another area.
In corn (maize), transposons are responsible for mutant strains whose kernels lack pigmentation or have spotted
pigmentation.
The human genome has as much as 50% of its DNA derived from transposons, although most transposons appear to
be inactively sitting within introns.
Viruses
Viruses are parasites of cells. A typical virus penetrates a cell, commandeers its metabolic machinery, assembles
hundreds of new viruses that are copies of itself, and then leaves the cell to infect other cells. In the process, the host
cell is usually destroyed.
Viruses are specific for the kinds of cells they will parasitize. Some viruses attack only one kind of cell within
