ical reactions that are essential for the formation and maintenance 
of highly ordered biological structures are not spontaneous. These 
necessary reactions are made to occur by coupling them with spon-
taneous reactions that release energy. The metabolism of food is the 
usual source of the free energy needed to do the work of maintaining 
biological systems. For example, complete oxidation of the sugar glu-
cose, C6H12O6, to CO2 and H2O yields substantial free energy:
C6H12O61s2 + 6 O21g2 ¡ 6 CO21g2 + 6 H2O1l2 ∆G° = -2880 kJ
This energy can be used to drive nonspontaneous reactions in the 
body. However, a means is necessary to transport the energy released 
by glucose metabolism to the reactions that require energy. One way, 
shown in Figure 19.16, involves the interconversion of adenosine tri-
phosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), molecules that 
are related to the building blocks of nucleic acids. The conversion of 
ATP to ADP releases free energy 1∆G° = -30.5
