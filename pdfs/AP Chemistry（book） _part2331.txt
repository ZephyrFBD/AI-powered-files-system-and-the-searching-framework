the first step is slow and the second one is fast, which rate 
law do you expect to be observed for the overall reaction?
 14.72 The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is catalyzed by 
iodide ion. The catalyzed reaction is thought to proceed 
by a two-step mechanism:
  H2O21aq2 + I -1aq2 ยก H2O1l2 + IO -1aq2 1slow2
 IO -1aq2 + H2O21aq2 ยก H2O1l2 + O21g2 + I -1aq2 1fast2
 
 (a) Write the chemical equation for the overall process. 
(b) Identify the intermediate, if any, in the mechanism. 
(c) Assuming that the first step of the mechanism is rate 
determining, predict the rate law for the overall process.
 [14.73] The reaction 2 NO1g2 + Cl21g2 ยก 2 NOCl1g2 was per-
formed and the following data were obtained under con-
ditions of constant 3Cl24:

determining step?
 14.66 (a) Can an intermediate appear as a reactant in the first 
step of a reaction mechanism?
