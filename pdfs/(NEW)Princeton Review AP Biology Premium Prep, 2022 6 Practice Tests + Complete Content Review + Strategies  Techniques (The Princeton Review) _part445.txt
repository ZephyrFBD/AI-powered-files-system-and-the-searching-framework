ia begin to compete with each other for
resources. When the resources become limited, the population reaches its carrying capacity, and the curve levels off.
This kind of logistic growth can be calculated with the following equation:
The population becomes restricted in size because of limited resources. This is referred to as logistic growth. Notice
from the graph on the previous page that the growth forms an S-shaped curve.
One More Equation for the Road
On the AP Exam, you may see the logistic growth equation written as 
Essentially it’s the same as the exponential equation except when the
population size approaches the carrying capacity, the growth rate approaches
zero.
These growth patterns are associated with two kinds of life-history strategies: r-selected species and k-selected
species.
Those who thrive in areas that are barren or uninhabited are known as r-strategists. Once they colonize an area,
they reproduce as quickly as possible. Why? They know they’ve got to multiply bef
