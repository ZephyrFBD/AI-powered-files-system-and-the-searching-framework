stay the same as the cell operates.
 20.71  The cell in Figure 20.9 could be used to provide a mea-
sure of the pH in the cathode half-cell. Calculate the pH 
of the cathode half-cell solution if the cell emf at 298 K 
is measured to be +0.684 V when 3Zn2+4 = 0.30 M and 
P
H2 = 0.90 atm.
 20.72  A voltaic cell is constructed that is based on the following 
reaction:
Sn2+1aq2 + Pb1s2 ¡ Sn1s2 + Pb2+1aq2
(a) If the concentration of Sn2+ in the cathode half-cell is 
1.00 M and the cell generates an emf of +0.22 V, what is 
the concentration of Pb2+ in the anode half-cell? (b) If the 
anode half-cell contains 3SO4
2-4 = 1.00 M in equilibrium 
with PbSO41s2, what is the Ksp of PbSO4?
