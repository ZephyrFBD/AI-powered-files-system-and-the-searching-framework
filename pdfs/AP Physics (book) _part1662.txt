 smaller and denser means
the Sun gets hotter. For astronomical objects, when heat flows from a hot object to a cooler object,
the hot object gets hotter and the cool one cooler. That is, the temperature difference increases.
15–10 Statistical Interpretation of
Entropy and the Second Law
The ideas of entropy and disorder are made clearer with the use of a statistical or
probabilistic analysis of the molecular state of a system. This statistical approach,
which was first applied toward the end of the nineteenth century by Ludwig
Boltzmann (1844–1906), makes a clear distinction between the “macrostate” and
the “microstate” of a system. The microstate of a system would be specified by
giving the position and velocity of every particle (or molecule). The macrostate
of a system is specified by giving the far fewer macroscopic properties of the
system—the temperature, pressure, number of moles, and so on. In reality, we
can know only the macrostate of a system. There are generally far too ma
