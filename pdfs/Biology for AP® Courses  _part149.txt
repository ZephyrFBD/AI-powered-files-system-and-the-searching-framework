s or other remains of extinct organisms to understand how organisms have evolved from

Figure 2.4 The age of carbon-containing remains less than about 50,000 years old, such as this pygmy mammoth,
can be determined using carbon dating. (credit: Bill Faulkner, NPS)
Based on carbon dating, scientists estimate this pygmy mammoth died 11,000 years ago. How would the ratio of
14 C to 12 C in a living elephant compare to the 14 C to 12 C ratio found in the mammoth?
a.
The ratio would be the same in the elephant and the mammoth.
b.
The ratio would be lower in the elephant than the mammoth.
c.
The ratio would be higher in the elephant than the mammoth.
d.
The ratio would depend on the diet of each animal.
