n to be complex
mathematically; therefore, they require a significant amount of mathematical knowledge and expertise. Although analytical
models have great potential, their simplification of complex ecosystems is thought to limit their accuracy. Simulation
models that use computer programs are better able to deal with the complexities of ecosystem structure.
A recent development in simulation modeling uses supercomputers to create and run individual-based simulations, which
accounts for the behavior of individual organisms and their effects on the ecosystem as a whole. These simulations are
considered to be the most accurate and predictive of the complex responses of ecosystems to disturbances.

Why doesnâ€™t an increased number of prey species in marine ecosystems lead to maximal feeding of predators?
a.
Because there may not be enough predators that can eat each of the prey spec
