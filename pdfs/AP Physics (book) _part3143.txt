le we mean something that is localized in
space—it has a definite position at any given instant. By contrast, a wave is
spread out in space. The electron cloud, spread out in space as in Fig. 28–6, is a
result of the wave nature of electrons. Electron clouds can also be interpreted as
probability distributions (or probability density) for a particle. As we saw in
Section 28–3, we cannot predict the path an electron will follow (thinking of it as
a particle). After one measurement of its position we cannot predict exactly where
it will be at a later time. We can only calculate the probability that it will be found
at different points. If you were to make 500 different measurements of the position
of an electron in a hydrogen atom, the majority of the results would show the
electron at points where the probability is high (dark area in Fig. 28–6). Only 
occasionally would the electron be found where the probability is low. The
electron cloud or probability distribution becomes small (or
