The reaction shown at the start of this paragraph does
not conserve baryon number since the left side has 
and the right has 
On the other hand, the
following reaction does conserve B and does occur if the incoming proton has
sufficient energy:
As indicated,
on both sides of this equation. From these and other
reactions, the conservation of baryon number has been established as a basic
principle of physics.
Also useful are conservation laws for the three lepton numbers, associated
with weak interactions including decays. In ordinary 
decay, an electron or posi-
tron is emitted along with a neutrino or antineutrino. In another type of decay,
a particle known as a “ ” or muon, can be emitted instead of an electron.
The muon (discovered in 1937) seems to be much like an electron, except its
mass is 207 times larger 
The neutrino 
that accompanies an
emitted electron is found to be different from t
