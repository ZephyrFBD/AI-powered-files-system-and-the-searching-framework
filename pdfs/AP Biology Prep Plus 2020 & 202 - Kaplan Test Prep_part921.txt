nts to tissues.
(B)
MSM decreases blood pressure, causing tissues to become
overloaded with carbon dioxide and waste.
(C)
MSM restores cell pressure balance by hardening cell membranes to
restrict transport of oxygen and nutrients.
(D)
57. A scientist performs an experiment under laboratory conditions to study
the activity of a specific enzyme. Data about substrate and product
concentration over time is collected and analyzed. Which of the following
statements correctly explains why the indicated experimental variable
must be carefully maintained to ensure that accurate data is obtained?
The cofactor concentration must be maintained at low levels
because an overabundance will cause them to competitively inhibit
the substrate.
(A)
The temperature must be held as high as possible because enzymes
have their greatest catalytic activity at high temperatures.
(B)
The pH must be held constant because changes in pH can cause the
enzymes to undergo a structural change, rendering them unusable.
