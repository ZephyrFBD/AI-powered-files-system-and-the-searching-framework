ng water to flow out of the
cells through osmosis. As a result, the cells shrink. When neurons
shrink, people can experience diﬀerent symptoms, ranging from
confusion to hallucinations to death.
Researchers wish to observe the eﬀects of hypernatremia in the
lab. They take a synthetic cell originally submerged in distilled
water and place it in a solution containing 0.5 M NaCl. Using the
information provided and assuming the experiment is being
carried out in an open container at room temperature (25°C),
calculate the diﬀerence in the water potential before and
immediately aȇer the cell is placed in the salt solution. Round
your answer to the nearest tenth.

12. Although prokaryotes lack the membrane-bound organelles that
are found in eukaryotes, they are still able to carry out most of the
same functions. Which of the following provides an example of a
mechanism prokaryotes use to carry out the function of the
associated eukaryotic organelle?
