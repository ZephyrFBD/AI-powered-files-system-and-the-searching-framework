multaneously, the two sets of circu-
lar waves that move outward interfere with one another as shown in Fig.11–38a. In
some areas of overlap, crests of one wave repeatedly meet crests of the other (and
troughs meet troughs), Fig. 11–38b. Constructive interference is occurring at these
points, and the water continuously oscillates up and down with greater amplitude
than either wave separately. In other areas, destructive interference occurs where the
water does not move up and down at all over time. This is where crests of one wave
meet troughs of the other, and vice versa. Figure 11–39a shows the displacement
of two identical waves graphically as a function of time, as well as their sum, for
the case of constructive interference. For any two such waves, we use the term
phase to describe the relative positions of their crests. When the crests and troughs
are aligned as in Fig.11–39a, for constructive interference, the two waves are in phase.
At points where destructive interference occu
