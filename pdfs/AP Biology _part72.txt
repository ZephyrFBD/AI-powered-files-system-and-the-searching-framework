STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE CELL
A major theme in biology (and therefore a common free-response question
topic) is that function dictates form and vice versa. As a result, one would
expect that all cells do not look alike. And they do not. The nerve cell,
whose purpose is to send electrical impulses, is long and spindly. Cells that
store fat are rounded, large, and distended. Cells that make up a tough
peach pit resemble square building blocks. Figure 3.2 shows a sketch of
different cell types, each with a different overall appearance suited for
each different function.

KEEP THIS IN MIND
Form and function go together.

Why Cells Are Small
Although various cells have different characteristics, they are all tiny. This
is because the surface area of the cell membrane must be able to
accommodate the metabolic needs, based on the volu
