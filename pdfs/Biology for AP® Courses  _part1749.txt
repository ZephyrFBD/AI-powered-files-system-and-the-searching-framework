ysically prevent the binding of RNA polymerase. If tryptophan is not needed by the cell, the genes necessary
to produce it are turned off. Activator control (typified by the action of Catabolite Activator Protein) increases the binding
ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter. Certain genes are continually expressed via this regulatory mechanism.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The learning objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
