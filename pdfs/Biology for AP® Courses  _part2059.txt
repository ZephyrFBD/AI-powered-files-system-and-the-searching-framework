he human genome, you find a gene
that is not homologous to any other organisms known to
man. You conclude that this gene must be unique to the
human species and could not have evolved from another
organism. Would this discovery suggest that humans do
not share a common ancestor with all other organisms on
Earth? Explain your answer.
31. Mutations in the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) gene can cause a rare anemia when inherited.
However, homozygotes with this mutation are less prone
to malaria infection, a disease that historically was the
most widespread deadly disease among humans. Predict
how this mutation would affect the fitness of individuals
living in countries where malaria is endemic.
