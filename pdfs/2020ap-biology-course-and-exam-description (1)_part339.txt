Explain how any one chromosome in individual 16 contains “DNA” that came from both individuals 1 and 2.
•	 Individual 5 inherited one member of each homologous pair of chromosomes from individuals 1 and 2. 
During gamete formation in individual 5, crossing over occurred between nonsister chromatids in each 
homologous pair. Thus each chromosome formed and passed on to individual 16 contains DNA from 
both 1 and 2.

Indicate the genotypes of individuals 2, 4, 8, and 18.
•	 Individual 2, 4, and 18: The genotype of all three is Bb.
•	 Individual 8: The genotype is bb.

Explain whether the inheritance pattern of the condition is sex-linked or autosomal and dominant  
or recessive.
•	 The disease phenotype is recessive and is autosomal/not sex-linked. It cannot be dominant because 
individuals 3 and 4 do not have it, but their offspring 14 does. It is not sex-linked because if it was 
Y-linked
