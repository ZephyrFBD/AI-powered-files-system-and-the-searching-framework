ates the Ras protein. The Ras protein then initiates a MAK cascade,
which ultimately activates a transcription factor. One such transcription factor binds to DNA at the gene called p53.
The product of p53, protein 53, checks for DNA damage. If the DNA is damaged, p53 directs enzymes to repair the
DNA. Once repaired, p53 permits cell division to proceed. If repair is unsuccessful, it directs other enzymes to kill
the cell, thus preventing the proliferation of damaged cells. Such programed cell death is called apoptosis. If a
member protein in the MAP signal transduction pathway is damaged or if the DNA contains a mutated version of
p53, the p53 protein product may be critically altered or nonexistent. As a result, DNA surveillance does not occur
and cell division progresses even if the DNA is damaged. Continued uncontrolled cell division leads to a
proliferation of cancer cells. Although mutations in p53 and other genes can be inherited, they are also caused by the
