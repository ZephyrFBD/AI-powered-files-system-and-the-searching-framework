number.† Such logarithms are called natural logarithms and are written “ln”. Thus,
For any number y, the two types of logarithm are related by
Some simple rules for logarithms include:
(A;7)
This is true because if

From the

hence,
In a similar way, we can show the rules
(A;8)
and
(A;9)
These three rules apply not only to common logs but to natural or any other 
kind of logarithm.
Logs were once used as a technique for simplifying certain types of calcu-
lation. Because of the advent of electronic calculators and computers, they 
are not often used any more for that purpose. However, logs do appear in 
certain physical equations, so it is helpful to know how to deal with them. If
you do not have a calculator that calculates logs, you can use a log table,
such as the small one shown here (Table A–1). The number N is given to 
two digits (some tables give N to three or more digits); the first d
