44. How close must two electrons be if the magnitude of the
electric force between them is equal to the weight of either
at the Earth’s surface?
45. Given that the human body is mostly made of water, esti-
mate the total amount of positive charge in a 75-kg person.
46. A 3.0-g copper penny has a net positive charge of 
What fraction of its electrons has it lost?
47. Measurements indicate that there is an electric field sur-
rounding the Earth. Its magnitude is about 
at the
Earth’s surface and points inward toward the Earth’s center.
What is the magnitude of the electric charge on the Earth?
Is it positive or negative? [
