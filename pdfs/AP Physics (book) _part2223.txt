s as in Figs. 18–19b and c. Magnetic circuit breakers react quickly 
and for buildings are designed to react to the high currents of short circuits (but
not shut off for the start-up surges of motors).
In more sophisticated circuit breakers, including ground fault circuit inter-
rupters (GFCIs—discussed in Section 21–9), a solenoid is used. The iron rod of
Fig. 20–29, instead of striking a bell, strikes one side of a pair of electric contact
points, opening them and opening the circuit. They react very quickly 
and to very small currents 
and thus protect humans (not just property)
and save lives.
