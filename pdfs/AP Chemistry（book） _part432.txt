lecules of C6H12O6, we can use the chemical formula, which 
tells us that each molecule of C6H12O6 contains 12 H atoms. Thus, 
we convert moles of C6H12O6 to molecules of C6H12O6 and then 
determine the number of atoms of H from the number of mole-
cules of C6H12O6:
Moles C6H12O6 ¡ molecules C6H12O6 ¡  H atoms

Give It Some Thought 
(a) Which has more mass, a mole of water (H2O) or a mole of glucose  
(C6H12O6)?
(b) Which contains more molecules, a mole of water or a mole of glucose?
Solve
 H atoms = 10.350 mol C6H12O62a
6.02 * 1023 molecules C6H12O6
1 mol C6H12O6
b a
12 H atoms
1 molecule C6H12O6
b 
 = 2.53 * 1024 H atoms
Check We can do a ballpark calculation, figuring that 
0.3516 * 10232 is about 2 * 1023 molecules of C6H12O6. We 
know that each one of these mole
