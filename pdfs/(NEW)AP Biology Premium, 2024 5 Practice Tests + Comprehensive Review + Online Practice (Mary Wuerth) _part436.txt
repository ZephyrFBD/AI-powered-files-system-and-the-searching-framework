t cause them to be sensitive to an antibiotic; others have genotypes
that confer resistance to an antibiotic. As antibiotics are applied to the environment of a population of bacteria,
individual bacterium that are sensitive to the antibiotic will die out while bacteria that have resistance to the
antibiotic will survive and reproduce. With continued exposure to the antibiotic, over time, only the antibiotic-
resistant bacteria will survive and be present in the population. Note that individual bacterium do not evolve or
“learn” to be resistant to the antibiotic; some bacteria already possess the variation that gives them resistance.
Initially, these antibiotic-resistant bacteria are less prevalent in the population, but these bacteria are more likely to
survive and reproduce in an environment that contains the antibiotic than those that are not antibiotic resistant. Over
time, as these bacteria reproduce in the presence of the antibiotic, the frequency of bacteria with antibiotic resi
