Sinusoidal Motion
Equation 11–8a,
assumes that the oscillating object starts from rest
at its maximum displacement 
at
Other equations for SHM
are also possible, depending on the initial conditions (when you choose to be zero).

x = A cos vt,
For example, if at 
the object is at the equilibrium position and the oscilla-
tions are begun by giving the object a push to the right 
the equation would be
This curve, shown in Fig. 11–9, has the same shape as the cosine curve shown in
Fig. 11–8, except it is shifted to the right by a quarter cycle. Hence at 
it

instead of at
Both sine and cosine curves are referred to as being sinusoidal (having the
shape of a sine function). Thus simple harmonic motion† is said to be sinusoidal
because the position varies as a sinusoidal function of time.
