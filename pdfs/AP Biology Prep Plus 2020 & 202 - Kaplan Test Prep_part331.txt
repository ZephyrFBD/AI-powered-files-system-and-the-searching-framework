GDP. Thus, the cholera toxin interferes with this stage, making (D)
correct. (A) is incorrect because this is not a typical stage in the
signaling cycle and because cholera does not bind to the receptor, but
uses a diﬀerent mechanism to enter the cell. (B) is incorrect because
the G-protein complex is still able to dissociate into subunits in the

presence of the toxin. (C) is incorrect because adenylyl cyclase is
continuously activated in the presence of the cholera toxin, as stated in
the question stem.
5. B
Learning Objective: 8.5
According to the results, only cells in close proximity to the infected
cell express an antiviral response. This suggests a type of paracrine
signaling. (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because endocrine
signaling can act over large distances by traveling through the
bloodstream, but cells outside of the immediate vicinity of cell A do
not express the antiviral response. (C) is incorrect because electrical
