opes of the plots represent
the rates of oxygen
 
consumption (changes in O2 with time, expressed as ml • g−1 • min−1,
or ml/g·min). Because the slopes are constant (nearly straight lines), the respiratory rates are constant, but differ for
the two temperatures. Oxygen production is recorded in ml/g, which means the amount of oxygen produced, in
milliliters, is divided by the weight, in grams, of the hamster. As a result, oxygen production by hamsters with
different sizes is averaged over their weights. Although these hamsters may indeed have different respiratory rates
(due to size or even physiological differences), these differences are not detectable in the reported data.
22. D. In this experiment, time is an independent variable and respiratory rate is the dependent variable.
Temperature is also an independent variable, but this variable was assigned two values (10°C and 25°C) for the
purpose of examining how temperature affects respiratory rate over time. But within each chamber,
