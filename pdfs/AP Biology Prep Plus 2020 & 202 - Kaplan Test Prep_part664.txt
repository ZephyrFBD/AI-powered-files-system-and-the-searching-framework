dominance. Backcrossing the F1 flowers to the white parent would
give a ratio of 1:1 pink:white. Therefore, (B) is incorrect. Since the
expected ratio for self-crossing the F1 flowers is 1:2:1 of red:pink:white,
(C) and (D) are incorrect.

According to the figure, approximately half of the Avr2.1 plants are
either intermediate or completely resistant. Therefore, approximately
50% of the 240 total plants produced should exhibit some level of
resistance: ½ × 240 = 120. Therefore, (D) is correct.
8. B
Learning Objective: 15.2
Evaluate each answer choice. According to the data, (A) is incorrect
because the MCF7 cell line, which is XIST positive, has two active X
chromosomes. Thus, cancer cells do not need to stop producing XIST
to have two active X chromosomes. (B) is the correct answer. Since the
MCF7 cancer line is XIST positive but still has two active X
chromosomes, there must be other factors involved in X chromosome
inactivation. (C) is incorrect becau
