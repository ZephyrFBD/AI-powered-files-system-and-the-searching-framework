 can have lemonade too, that raggedy pair, and God above, ’tis a hard 
 
 world, the minute you think you’re getting ahead a pram comes crashing 
 
 through the door and you’re dishing out sweets and lemonade right 
 
 and left, the two of ye take that child and go home to yeer mother. 
 
 Malachy has another powerful idea, that we could go around Limerick 
 
 like tinkers pushing Alphie in his pram into pubs for the sweets 
 
 and lemonade, but I don’t want Mam finding out and hitting me with 
 
 her right cross. Malachy says I’m not a sport and runs off. I push the 
 
  
  
 pram over to Henry Street and up by the Redemptorist church. It’s a 
 
 gray day, the church is gray and the small crowd of people outside the 
 
 door of the priests’ house is gray.They’re waiting to beg for any food 
 
 left over from the priests’ dinner. 
 
 There in the middle of the crowd in her dirty gray coat is my 
 
 mother. 
 
 This is my own mother, begging.This is worse than the dole, the St.
