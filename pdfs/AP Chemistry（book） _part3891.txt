24.10 ∣ Nucleic Acids
Nucleic acids are a class of biopolymers that are the chemical carriers of 
an organism’s genetic information. Deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs) are 
huge molecules whose molecular weights may range from 6 to 16 million 
amu. Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) are smaller molecules, with molecular 
weights in the range of 20,000 to 40,000 amu. Whereas DNA is found pri-
marily in the nucleus of the cell, RNA is found mostly outside the nucleus 
in the cytoplasm, the nonnuclear material enclosed by the cell membrane. 
DNA stores the genetic information of the cell and specifies which proteins 
the cell can synthesize. RNA car
