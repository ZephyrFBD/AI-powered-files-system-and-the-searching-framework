Science Practice
5.3: The student can evaluate the evidence provided by 
data sets in relation to a particular scientific question.
Learning Objective 
1.26: The student is able to evaluate given data sets that 
illustrate evolution as an ongoing process.
(A)
This option is incorrect. The data provide no evidence to support this conclusion. 
The return to pre-drought conditions no longer would favor only plants with 
thick-walled seeds. With an overall increase in the number of plants due to water 
availability, there would be more variety in the types of seeds available as a food 
resource for the finches. Thus, the food supply would be expected to increase,  
not decrease.
(B)
This option is correct. It demonstrates an ability to evaluate data providing 
evidence for evolution as an ongoing process. At the end of the drought 
period, there was a natural return to a variety of seeds available â€” including a 
decrease in thick-walled seeds. Thus, allele frequencies s
