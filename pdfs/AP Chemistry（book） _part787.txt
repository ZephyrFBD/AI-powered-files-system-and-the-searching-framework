gy our bodies need comes from carbohydrates and fats. The carbohy-
drates known as starches are decomposed in the intestines into glucose, C6H12O6. 
Glucose is soluble in blood, and in the human body it is known as blood sugar. It is trans-
ported by the blood to cells where it reacts with O2 in a series of steps, eventually produc-
ing CO21g2, H2O1l2, and energy:
 
C6H12O61s2 + 6 O21g2 ¡ 6 CO21g2 + 6 H2O1l2   ∆H° = -2803 kJ 
 
Sample Exercise 5.13 
Estimating Reaction Enthalpies from Bond Enthalpies
Use Table 5.4 to estimate ∆H for the following combustion reaction.
SOLUTION
Check This estimate can be compared with the value of -2856 kJ 
calculated from more accurate thermochemical data; the  
agreement is good.
Analyze We are asked to use average bond enthalpies to estimate 
the enthalpy change for a chemical reaction.
Plan Energy is required to break twelve C—H bonds and two C—C 
bonds in the two molecules of C2H6, and seven O “O bonds in 
the seven O2 molecules. Energy is released
