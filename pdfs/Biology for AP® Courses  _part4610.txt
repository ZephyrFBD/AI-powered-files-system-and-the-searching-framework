mers generated 3368 kcal/m2/yr, the secondary consumers generated 383 kcal/m2/yr, and
the tertiary consumers only generated 21 kcal/m2/yr. Thus, there is little energy remaining for another level of consumers in
this ecosystem.

Figure 37.5 The relative energy in trophic levels in a Silver Springs, Florida, ecosystem is shown. Each trophic level
has less energy available and supports fewer organisms at the next level.
There is a problem when using food chains to accurately describe most ecosystems. Even when all organisms are grouped
into appropriate trophic levels, some of these organisms can feed on species from more than one trophic level; likewise,
some of these organisms can be eaten by species from multiple trophic levels. In other words, the linear model of
ecosystems, the food chain, is not completely descriptive of ecosystem structure. A holistic modelâ€”which accounts for
all the interactions between different species and their complex interconnected
