introducing mutations in a gene, or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene
sequence from the genome of an organism.
Biotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture
It is easy to see how biotechnology can be used for medicinal purposes. Knowledge of the genetic makeup of our species,
the genetic basis of heritable diseases, and the invention of technology to manipulate and fix mutant genes provides methods
to treat the disease. Biotechnology in agriculture can enhance resistance to disease, pest, and environmental stress, and
improve both crop yield and quality.
Genetic Diagnosis and Gene Therapy
The process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called genetic diagnosis by genetic
testing. Depending on the inheritance patterns of a disease-causing gene, family members are advised to undergo genetic
testing. For example, women diagnosed with breast cancer are usually advised to have a biopsy so that the medical
