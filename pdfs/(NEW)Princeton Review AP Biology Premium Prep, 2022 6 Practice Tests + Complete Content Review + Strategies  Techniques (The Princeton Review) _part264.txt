homeostasis, and insulin release is shut off via negative feedback.
Many of these responses are controlled by negative or positive feedback pathways. A negative feedback pathway
(also called feedback inhibition) works by turning itself off using the end product of the pathway. The end product
inhibits the process from beginning, thus shutting down the pathway. This is a common strategy to conserve energy.
If plenty of X is made, then the pathway to make X can be turned off. Sometimes, a very distant end product will
turn off a process occurring several steps back. For example, ATP turns off the beginning stages of glycolysis,
although ATP is not made until much later in cellular respiration. There are several other types of second
messengers, such as cyclic GMP, calcium ions, and inositol triphosphate.
A positive feedback pathway also involves an end product playing a role, but instead of inhibiting the pathway, it
further stimulates it. For example, once X is
