15.5 Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis
The players in translation include the mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors. The small
ribosomal subunit forms on the mRNA template either at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (prokaryotes) or the 5' cap
(eukaryotes). Translation begins at the initiating AUG on the mRNA, specifying methionine. The formation of peptide
bonds occurs between sequential amino acids specified by the mRNA template according to the genetic code. Charged
tRNAs enter the ribosomal A site, and their amino acid bonds with the amino acid at the P site. The entire mRNA is
translated in three-nucleotide “steps” of the ribosome. When a nonsense codon is encountered, a release factor binds and
dissociates the components and frees the new protein. Folding of the protein occurs during and after translation.
