▶Practice Exercise 2
Calculate the percentage of potassium, by mass,  
in K2PtCl6.
SOLUTION
We’ll use the steps outlined in the Strategies For Success: Problem 
Solving feature to answer the question.
Analyze We are given a chemical formula and asked to calculate 
the percentage by mass of each element.
Plan We use Equation 3.10, obtaining our atomic weights from a 
periodic table. We know the denominator in Equation 3.10, the for-
mula weight of C12H22O11, from Sample Exercise 3.5. We must use 
that value in three calculations, one for each element.
Solve
 %C =
1122112.0 amu2
342.0 amu
* 100% = 42.1%
 %H =
122211.0 amu2
342.0 amu
* 100% = 6.4%
 %O =
1112116.0 amu2
342.0 amu
* 100% = 51.5%
Check Our calculated percentages must add up to 100%, which 
they do. We could have used more significant figures for our 
atomic weights, giving more significant figures for our percentage 
composition, but we have adhered to our suggested guideline
