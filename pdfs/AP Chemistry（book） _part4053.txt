11.65 In a nematic liquid crystalline phase, molecules are aligned 
along their long axes, but the molecular ends are not aligned. Mol-
ecules are free to translate in all dimensions, but they cannot tum-
ble or rotate out of the molecular plane, or the order of the nematic 
phase is lost and the sample becomes an ordinary liquid. In an ordi-
nary liquid, molecules are randomly oriented and free to move in any 
direction. 11.67 (a) True (b) false (c) true (d) false (e) false (f) true 
11.69 Because order is maintained in at least one dimension, the 
molecules in a liquid-crystalline phase are not totally free to change 
orientation. This makes the liquid-crystalline phase more resistant 
to ﬂow, more viscous, than the isotropic liquid. 11.71 Melting pro-
vides kinetic energy sufficient to disrupt molecular alignment in 
one dimension in the solid, producing a smectic phase with order-
ing in two dimensions. Additional heating of the smectic phase
