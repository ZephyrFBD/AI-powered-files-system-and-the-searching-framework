uid concentrations conform to changes in seawater concentration. Cartilaginous fishesâ€™ salt composition of the blood
is similar to bony fishes; however, the blood of sharks contains the organic compounds urea and trimethylamine oxide
(TMAO). This does not mean that their electrolyte composition is similar to that of sea water. They achieve isotonicity
with the sea by storing large concentrations of urea. These animals that secrete urea are called ureotelic animals. TMAO
stabilizes proteins in the presence of high urea levels, preventing the disruption of peptide bonds that would occur in other
animals exposed to similar levels of urea. Sharks are cartilaginous fish with a rectal gland to secrete salt and assist in
osmoregulation.
