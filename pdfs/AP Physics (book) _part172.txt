 former case.
Galileo claimed that all objects, light or heavy, fall with the same accel-
eration, at least in the absence of air. If you hold a piece of paper flat and
horizontal in one hand, and a heavier object like a baseball in the other, and
release them at the same time as in Fig. 2–20a, the heavier object will reach the
ground first. But if you repeat the experiment, this time crumpling the paper 
into a small wad, you will find (see Fig. 2–20b) that the two objects reach the floor
at nearly the same time.
Galileo was sure that air acts as a resistance to very light objects that have
a large surface area. But in many ordinary circumstances this air resistance is
negligible. In a chamber from which the air has been removed, even light
objects like a feather or a horizontally held piece of paper will fall with the
same acceleration as any other object (see Fig. 2–21). Such a demonstration in
vacuum was not possible in Galileo’s time, which makes Galileo’s achievement
