 effects of changing an environmental variable (e.g., pH) can be determined. 
Rate can have more than one applicable definition because this lab has two major 
options of approach, i.e., using a color palette and/or a spectrophotometer to measure 
percent of light absorbance. When using a color palette to compare the change in a 
reaction, you can infer increase, decrease, or no change in the rate; this inference is 
usually called the 
 relative rate of the reaction. When using a spectrophotometer (or 
other measuring devices) to measure the actual percent change in light absorbance, the 
rate is usually referred to as absolute rate of the reaction. In this case, a specific amount 
of time can be measured, such as 0.083 absorbance/minute.
