1. Digital cameras may offer an optical zoom or a digital zoom.
An optical zoom uses a variable focal-length lens, so only
the central part of the field of view fills the entire sensor;
a digital zoom electronically includes only the central
pixels of the sensor, so objects are larger in the final picture.
Discuss which is better, and why.

corrected by using different spherical lenses for each eye.
