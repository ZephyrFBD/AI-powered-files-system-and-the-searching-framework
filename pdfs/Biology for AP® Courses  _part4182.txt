between a biotic or abiotic factor and a biological system.
Biogeography
Biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their distribution.
Abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall vary based mainly on latitude and elevation. As these abiotic factors change,
the composition of plant and animal communities also changes. For example, if you were to begin a journey at the equator
and walk north, you would notice gradual changes in plant communities. At the beginning of your journey, you would see
tropical wet forests with broad-leaved evergreen trees, which are characteristic of plant communities found near the equato
