 electrical
gradient, a difference of charge, across the plasma membrane. The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect
to the extracellular fluid in which they are bathed, and at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (K+)
and lower concentrations of sodium (Na+) than does the extracellular fluid. So in a living cell, the concentration gradient
of Na+ tends to drive it into the cell, and the electrical gradient of Na+ (a positive ion) also tends to drive it inward to the
negatively charged interior. The situation is more complex, however, for other elements such as potassium. The electrical
gradient of K+, a positive ion, also tends to drive it into the cell, but the concentration gradient of K+ tends to drive K+
out of the cell (Figure 5.16). The combined gradient of concentration and electrical charge that affects an ion is called its
electrochemical gradient.
