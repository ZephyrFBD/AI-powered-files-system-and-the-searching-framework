oﬀ more heat to its
surroundings—therefore (B) is correct. (A) is incorrect because it states the
opposite; you know that larger animals need less energy per gram of body

the cattle influences the amount of nitrate that would cause nitrate
toxicity; therefore, (C) is incorrect. There is nothing in the passage to
suggest that one type of grass has more caloric input than the other;
therefore, (D) is incorrect.

Translation is when mRNA is used to create proteins, and the process
happens in the ribosomes. Ribosomes are the “rough” part of the rough
endoplasmic reticulum (ER); therefore, translation happens in the rough
ER and (B) is the correct answer. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum does not
have ribosomes and therefore (C) is incorrect. While ribosomes are in the
cytoplasm, (A) does not provide enough information to assure that the
microRNAs will be close to the site of translation. It is easy to think of all
