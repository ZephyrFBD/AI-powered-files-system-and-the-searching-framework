“What Are Bacterial Biofilms?”
Recurrent urinary tract infections occur when the urinary tract becomes reinfected by the same bacteria. Why are
recurrent urinary infections difficult to treat?
a.
Bacteria often form biofilms in recurrent infections and these may be more antibiotic resistant.
b.
Bacteria rarely form biofilms in recurrent infections, making them more resistant to antibiotics than if they
were not in a biofilm.
c.
Bacteria produce biofilms which behave like a unicellular organism.
d.
Bacteria don't produce biofilms in recurrent infections but become resistant due to repeated exposure to
antibiotics.
