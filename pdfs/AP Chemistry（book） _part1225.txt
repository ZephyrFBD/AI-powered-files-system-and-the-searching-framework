important concepts of bonding. The octet rule mostly applies to atoms that have s and 
 
p valence electrons; compounds of the transition metals, having valence d electrons, 
 
will be examined in Chapter 23.
8.2 ∣ Ionic Bonding
Ionic substances generally result from the interaction of metals on the left side of the 
 
periodic table with nonmetals on the right side (excluding the noble gases, group 8A). 
For example, when sodium metal, Na(s), is brought into contact with chlorine gas, 
Cl21g2, a violent reaction ensues (Figure 8.3). The product of this very exothermic reaction 
is sodium chloride, NaCl(s):
