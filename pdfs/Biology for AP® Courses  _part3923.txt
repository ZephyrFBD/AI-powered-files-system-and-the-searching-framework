d are approximately 80 to 90 percent T cells, shown in Figure 33.9, and 10 to 20
percent B cells. Recall that the T cells are involved in the cell-mediated immune response, whereas B cells are part of the
humoral immune response.
T cells encompass a heterogeneous population of cells with extremely diverse functions. Some T cells respond to APCs of
the innate immune system, and indirectly induce immune responses by releasing cytokines. Other T cells stimulate B cells
to prepare their own response. Another population of T cells detects APC signals and directly kills the infected cells. Other
T cells are involved in suppressing inappropriate immune reactions to harmless or “self” antigens.

Figure 33.9 This scanning electron micrograph shows a T lymphocyte, which is responsible for the cell-mediated
immune response. T cells are able to recognize antigens. (credit: modificatio
