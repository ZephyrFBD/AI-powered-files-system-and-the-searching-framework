MITOSIS: THE DANCE OF THE CHROMOSOMES
Once the chromosomes have replicated, the cell is ready to begin mitosisâ€”the period during which the cell divides.
Mitosis consists of a sequence of four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. It is not important to
memorize the name of each phase, but it is important that you know the basic order of operations for mitosis.
Remember, the genome is all the DNA, or all the chromosomes, in a cell.
Stage 1: Prophase: Prep (the cell prepares to divide)
One of the first signs of prophase is the disappearance of the nucleolus (ribosome-making area) and the nuclear
envelope. In addition, the genome becomes visible as individual chromosomes; diffuse chromatin (which looks like
a pile of scrunched up dental floss in the nucleus) condenses into densely packed chromosomes. To accomplish this,
chromatin forms coils upon coils and thickens. If you look at a human cell under the light microscope
