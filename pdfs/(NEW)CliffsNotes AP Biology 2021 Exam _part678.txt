ore species resemble one another in appearance. There are two kinds of mimicry:
 
Müllerian mimicry occurs when several animals, all with some special defense mechanism, share the same
coloration. Müllerian mimicry is an effective strategy because a single pattern, shared among several animals, is
more easily learned by a predator than would be a different pattern for every animal. Thus, bees, yellow jackets, and
wasps all have yellow and black body markings.
Batesian mimicry occurs when an animal without any special defense mechanism mimics the coloration of an
animal that does possess a defense. For example, some defenseless flies have yellow and black markings but are
avoided by predators because they resemble the warning coloration of bees.
5. Pollination of many kinds of flowers occurs as a result of the coevolution of finely-tuned traits between the
flowers and their pollinators.
Pollen from flowers of the Yucca plant is collected by yucca moths. Pollination is accomplished when
