the Problem at least twice.
2. Consider only one object (at a time), and draw a 
free-body diagram for that object, showing all the
forces acting on that object. Include any unknown
forces that you have to solve for. Do not show any
forces that the chosen object exerts on other objects.
Draw the arrow for each force vector reasonably
accurately for direction and magnitude. Label each
force acting on the object, including forces you must
solve for, according to its source (gravity, person,
friction, and so on).
If several objects are involved, draw a free-body
diagram for each object separately. For each object,
show all the forces acting on that object (and only
forces acting on that object). For each (and every)
force, you must be clear about: on what object that
This Problem Solving Strategy should not be considered a prescription. Rather
it is a summary of things to do that will start you thinking and getting involved 
in the problem at hand.
When we are concerned only about tran
