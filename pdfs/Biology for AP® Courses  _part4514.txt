f miles to an area in Mexico

Explain how this migration behavior came to be
established in this species.

a.
Each new generation learned the migration
behavior by observing older generations and
mimicking their behavior patterns.
b.
In very early generations of this species, a few
individuals found that migration improved their
chances for survival and taught their young to
carry on the behavior.
c.
Individuals that migrated survived through the
winter, whereas individuals that did not migrate
died, leading to selection for migration in later
generations.
d.
When this butterfly emerged as a new species,
by chance it inherited the genetic material that
underlies long-distance migration behavior from
its ancestor.

organisms. What is a pheromone?

A pheromone is a type of chemical compound.
