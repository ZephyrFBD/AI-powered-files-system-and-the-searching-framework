the surroundings. Any spontaneous process is 
irreversible. A process that occurs at a constant temperature is said to 
be isothermal.
ENTROPY AND THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS (SEC-
TION 19.2) The spontaneous nature of processes is related to a ther-
modynamic state function called entropy, denoted S. For a process that 
occurs at constant temperature, the entropy change of the system is 
given by the heat absorbed by the system along a reversible path, di-
vided by the temperature: ∆S = qrev>T. For any process, the entropy

change of the universe equals the entropy change of the system plus 
the entropy change of the surroundings: ∆Suniv = ∆Ssys + ∆Ssurr. The 
way entropy controls the spontaneity of processes is given by the sec-
ond law of thermodynamics, which states that in an irreversible (spon-
taneous) process ∆Suniv 7 0. Entropy values are usually expressed in 
units of joules per kelvin, J>K.
