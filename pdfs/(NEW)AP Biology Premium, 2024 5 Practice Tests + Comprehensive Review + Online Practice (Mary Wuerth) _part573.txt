you to describe the biological concept that is being
illustrated by the experiment, identify the controls or variables, predict the results of the investigation, and justify
your predictions.
The more opportunities you have to practice these skills, the better prepared you will be for the AP Biology
exam. At least eight inquiry-based lab experiences are required in AP Biology, but no specific labs are required for
the AP Biology course. This chapter describes the 13 common labs that you should be familiar with.
These labs are not requirements for the course, so do not worry if your teacher did not go over these specific labs. Questions about the specifics of
these procedures are not typically tested on the AP Biology exam. The science practice skills you develop when you complete lab experiments are
what will help you succeed on the AP Biology exam.
The skills assessed by these labs are skills you should practice before you take the AP Biology exam. At the end
of the AP Biology course,
