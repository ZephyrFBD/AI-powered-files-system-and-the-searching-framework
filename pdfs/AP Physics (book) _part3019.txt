ht (actually X-rays) at various
materials, and detected light scattered at various angles. He found that the scattered
light had a slightly longer wavelength than did the incident light, and therefore a
slightly lower frequency indicating a loss of energy. He explained this result on the
basis of the photon theory as incident photons colliding with electrons of the
material, Fig. 27–9. Using Eq. 27–6 for momentum of a photon, Compton applied
the laws of conservation of momentum and energy to the collision of Fig. 27–9
and derived the following equation for the wavelength of the scattered photons:
(27;7)
where 
is the mass of the electron. (The quantity 
which has the dimen-
sions of length, is called the Compton wavelength of the electron.) We see that
the predicted wavelength of scattered photons depends on the angle 
at which
they are detected. Compton’s measurements of 1923 were consistent with this
formula. The wave theory of light predicts no such shift: an incoming electro-
