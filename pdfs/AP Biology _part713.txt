ut 10% of men of
European descent (and much higher in some other groups), the duplicated
gene is nonfunctional. This results in red-green color blindness in those
men.
CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter covered cell communication, specifically the fact that cells
communicate by sending, transmitting, and receiving chemical signals.
Similar cell communication mechanisms among cells of different
organisms reflect a shared evolutionary history.
Negative feedback is a common mechanism in the endocrine
system to maintain homeostasis. For example, when the level of
thyroxine in the blood is too low, the hypothalamus releases a
tropic hormone, which stimulates the anterior pituitary to
stimulate yet another gland, the thyroid, to release more thyroxine.
Cells communicate using chemical signals within the endocrine
and nervous systems to support the organism as a whole.
