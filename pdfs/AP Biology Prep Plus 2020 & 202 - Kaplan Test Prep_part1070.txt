e change in allele frequencies due to a random sampling process that occurs
in small populations. One example is the bottleneck effect, which occurs when a natural
disaster leaves behind a small group of individuals. The allele frequencies of the small group
may differ from that of the original population, resulting in changes in the allele distribution
that become prominent over time.
(b) Explain why a new species formed from genetic driȇ may not be well adapted to
survive in its environment. (1 point)
Explanation (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The bottleneck eﬀect, generally caused by a catastrophe, leaves behind a small group of individuals.
The founder eﬀect, generally caused by colonization, occurs when a small group breaks oﬀ and becomes
isolated.
A new species formed from genetic driȇ is a result of random changes and not natural selection.
A new species formed from genetic drift is the result of a chance event and not natural
selection. Th
