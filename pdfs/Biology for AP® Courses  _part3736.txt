ssure is related to the blood velocity in the arteries and arterioles. In the capillaries and veins,
the blood pressure continues to decease but velocity increases.
Blood Pressure Regulation
Cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the heart in one minute. It is calculated by multiplying the number of
heart contractions that occur per minute (heart rate) times the stroke volume (the volume of blood pumped into the aorta
per contraction of the left ventricle). Therefore, cardiac output can be increased by increasing heart rate, as when exercising.
However, cardiac output can also be increased by increasing stroke volume, such as if the heart contracts with greater
strength. Stroke volume can also be increased by speeding blood circulation through the body so that more blood enters the
heart between contractions. During heavy exertion, the blood vessels relax and increase in diameter, offsetting the increased
heart rate and ensuring adequate oxygenated blood gets to the muscles. S
