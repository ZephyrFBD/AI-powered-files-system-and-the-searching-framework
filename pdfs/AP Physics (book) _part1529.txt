14–5 Latent Heat
When a material changes phase from solid to liquid, or from liquid to gas (see also
Section 13–11), a certain amount of energy is involved in this change of phase.
For example, let us trace what happens when a 1.0-kg block of ice at 
is heated at a slow steady rate until all the ice has changed to water, then the
(liquid) water is heated to 100°C and changed to steam, and heated further 
above 100°C, all at 1 atm pressure. As shown in the graph of Fig. 14–5, as the ice 
is heated starting at 
its temperature rises at a rate of about 
of heat added (since for ice,
). However, when 0°C is
