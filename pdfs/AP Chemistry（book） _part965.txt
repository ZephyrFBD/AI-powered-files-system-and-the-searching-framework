clei of many elements possess an intrinsic spin. Like electron 
spin, nuclear spin is quantized. For example, the  
nucleus of 1H has 
two possible magnetic nuclear spin quantum  
numbers, +1
2 and - 1
2.
A spinning hydrogen nucleus acts like a tiny magnet. In the 
 
absence of external effects, the two spin states have the same  
energy. 
However, when the nuclei are placed in an external magnetic ﬁeld, 
they can align either parallel or opposed (antiparallel) to the ﬁeld, 
 
depending on their spin. The parallel alignment is lower in  
energy 
than the antiparallel one by a certain amount, ∆E (Figure 6.27). If 
the nuclei are irradiated with photons having energy equal to ∆E, 
the spin of the nuclei can be “ﬂipped,” that is, excited from the 
parallel to the antiparallel alignment. Detection of the ﬂipping 
of nuclei between the two spin states leads to an NMR spectrum. 
The radiation used in an NMR experiment is in the radiofrequen-
cy range, typically 100 to 900 MHz, which is far l
