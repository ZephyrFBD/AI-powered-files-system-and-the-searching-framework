5â€™ ends and twist into a double helix.
Adenine always pairs with thymine, and guanine always pairs with cytosine.
All the DNA in a cell is the genome. It is divided up into chromosomes, which are divided up into genes that
each encode a particular genetic recipe.
DNA replication provides two copies of the DNA for cell division, which involves the following steps:
Helicase begins replication by unwinding DNA and separating the strands at the origin of replication.
Topoisomerases reduce supercoiling ahead of the replication fork.
RNA primase places an RNA primer down on the template strands.
DNA polymerase reads DNA base pairs of a strand as a template and lays down complementary nucleotides
to generate a new complementary partner strand.
Replication proceeds continuously on the leading strand.
The lagging strand forms Okazaki fragments, which must be joined later by DNA ligase.
Transcription involves building RNA from DNA.
RNA polymerase reads one of the DNA strands (the antisense/non
