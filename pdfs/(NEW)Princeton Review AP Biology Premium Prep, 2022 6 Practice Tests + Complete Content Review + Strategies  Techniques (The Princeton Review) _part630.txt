fter a twenty-week exercise program. The mitochondrial mass was
measured by cardiolipin, the citric acid cycle was measured by citrate synthase, and electron transport chain
activity was measured by NADH oxidase levels. The results are shown below in the table.
Table 1. Mean (upper rows) and standard error (lower rows) measurements for markers of ETC activity, in relative
units normalized to creatine kinase activity.
(a) Explain how the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain are related and how they are affected by
exercise.
(b) Construct a graph of the data indicating citric acid cycle activity. Be sure to use error bars.
(c) Identify which group did not show an increase in cardiolipin after exercise was done. Justify your choice
with data.
(d) If another measure of the citric acid cycle were added in a future experiment, explain what results you
would expect.
3. Maternal inheritance is one pattern of inheritance which does not follow the rules of Mendelian genetics. It is
