different enzymes are active. This is done either by switching on and off
the genes that code for enzymes or by regulating the enzymes once they
are made. Enzymes that have already been produced are regulated by
competitive or noncompetitive inhibition.
Competitive Inhibition
In competitive inhibition, some compounds resemble the substrate
molecules and compete for the same active site on the enzyme. These
mimics or competitive inhibitors reduce the amount of product by
preventing or limiting the substrate from binding to the enzyme. This kind
of inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentration of substrate.
See Figure 5.7. Competitive inhibition can be either reversible or
nonreversible.

Understand and be able to sketch how a change in the shape of one enzyme can alter
its function.
