Enzyme active sites are the places where the substrate binds. If the active site contains positively charged
residues, the substrate should have a negative charge because the active sites and substrate would attract
each other.

C
If calcium is prevalent outside the cell, then it will passively flow into the cell (as long as a calcium
channel is open) because it wants to move down its concentration gradient. The passage states that the
sarcoplasmic reticulum actively takes up calcium.
18.
D
Calcium links the action potential to contraction of the sarcomere, (D). It stimulates contraction; it does
not prevent it, (A). It is not the effect on hypertonicity that causes the action potentials, (B); action
potentials are calcium specific. Calcium just relays the action potential message; it does not amplify the
signal, (C).

C
Without troponin, the calcium could not move tropomyosin off the myosin binding sites, and then there
would be no contraction. If there were no tropomyosin,
