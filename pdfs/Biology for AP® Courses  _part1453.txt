Figure 13.11 Pericentric inversions include the centromere, and paracentric inversions do not. A pericentric inversion
can change the relative lengths of the chromosome arms; a paracentric inversion cannot.
When one homologous chromosome undergoes an inversion but the other does not, the individual is described as an
inversion heterozygote. To maintain point-for-point synapsis during meiosis, one homolog must form a loop, and the other
homolog must mold around it. Although this topology can ensure that the genes are correctly aligned, it also forces the
homologs to stretch and can be associated with regions of imprecise synapsis (Figure 13.12).
Figure 13.12 When one chromosome undergoes an inversion but the other does not, one chromosome must form an
inverted loop to retain point-for-point interaction during synapsis. This inversion pairing is essential to maintaining gene
alignment during meiosis and to allow for recombination.
