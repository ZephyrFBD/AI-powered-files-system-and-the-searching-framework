hed, and there is no further increase in the amount of solute in solution.

Give It Some Thought
Label the following processes as exothermic or endothermic:
(a) breaking solvent–solvent interactions to form separated particles
(b) forming solvent–solute interactions from separated particles
Nickel metal and hydrochloric acid
Nickel reacts with hydrochloric acid,
forming NiCl2(aq) and H2(g). The
solution is of NiCl2, not Ni metal
NiCl2·6 H2O(s) remains
when solvent evaporated
▲ Figure 13.6 The reaction between nickel metal and hydrochloric acid is not a simple dissolution. The product is NiCl2 # 6 H2O1s2, nickel(II) chloride 
hexahydrate, which has exactly 6 waters of hydration in the crystal lattice for every nickel ion.
A solution that is in equilibrium with undissolved solute is saturated. Additional 
solute will not dissolve if added to a saturated solution. The amount of solute needed to 
form a saturated solution in a given quantity of solvent is known as the solubi
