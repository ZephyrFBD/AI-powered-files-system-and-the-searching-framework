What are the roles of cleavage and fertilization in animal development?
Connection for AP® Courses
The information in this section is not within the scope for AP® other than to note that the process by which an organism
develops from a single-celled zygote to a multi-cellular organism with specialized cells, tissues, and organs is complex and
well regulated. The organization into a multi-cellular organism is regulated by an organism’s genes. Cell differentiation
is a result of specific gene expression, and homeotic (HOX) genes and morphogens control the pattern and timing of
developmental stages.
Information presented and examples highlighted in this section are not within the scope for AP® and do not align to the
Curriculum Framework.
Fertilization
Fertilization, pictured in Figure 34.20a is the process in which gametes (an egg and sperm) fuse to form a zygote. The
egg and sperm each contain one set of chromosomes. To ensure that the offspring has only one complete diploid set
of chr
