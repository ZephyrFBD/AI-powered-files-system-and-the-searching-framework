All physical systems can be thought of in this way: Living things are highly ordered, requiring constant energy input to
be maintained in a state of low entropy. As living systems take in energy-storing molecules and transform them through
chemical reactions, they lose some amount of usable energy in the process, because no reaction is completely efficient. They
also produce waste and by-products that aren’t useful energy sources. This process increases the entropy of the system’s
surroundings. Since all energy transfers result in the loss of some usable energy, the second law of thermodynamics states
that every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe. Even though living things are highly
ordered and maintain a state of low entropy, the entropy of the universe in total is constantly increasing due to the loss of
usable energy with each energy transfer that occurs. Essentially, living things are in a continuous uphill battle against this
