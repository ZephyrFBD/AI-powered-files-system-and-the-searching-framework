entration (midway between bottle and nose) can be approxi-
mated by
where V is the volume over which the molecules move 
and is roughly on the order of

We
substitute
into the above equation:
The concentration of ammonia is high near the bottle (C) and low near the
detecting nose 
so

Since 
molecules have a size somewhere between

can estimate
Then
or about a minute or two.
NOTE This result seems rather long from experience, suggesting that air currents
(convection) are more important than diffusion for transmitting odors.

ESTIMATE
Diffusion is extremely important for living organisms. For example, molecules
produced in certain chemical reactions within cells diffuse to other areas where
