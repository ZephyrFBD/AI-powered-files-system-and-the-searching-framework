Guided Inquiry in AP 
Instruction
The process of following an experimental procedure to confirm a known outcome can build basic laboratory 
skills. However, authentic inquiry allows students opportunities to develop and refine higher-order scientific 
thinking skills. Inquiry skills are built through gradual release in lessons (scaffolding levels). Instead of seeking 
confirmation of concepts, inquiry-based labs and classroom activities allow students, with guidance, to observe 
phenomena, explore ideas, and find patterns. This allows students to answer questions they have developed

where students can formulate questions, troubleshoot problems, and make appropriate adjustments.
