There would be no basal energy source.
c.
Carbon cannot be sequestered.

36. Energy is a fundamental component in an ecosystem
and is contributed by the primary producers. Describe how
light energy can, in turn, support the consumers of an

b.
Primary producers can only obtain energy from

c.
Primary producers convert light energy by
photosynthesis and consumers gain energy by
