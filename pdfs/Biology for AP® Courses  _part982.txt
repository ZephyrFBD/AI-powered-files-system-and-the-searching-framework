rate of photosynthesis
b.
Photosynthesis will slow down or stop possibly.
c.
Photosynthesis will increase exponentially.
d.
Photosynthesis will decrease and then increase.
30. Carbon, in the form of CO2, must be taken from the
atmosphere and attached to an existing organic molecule
in the Calvin cycle. Therefore, the carbon is bound to the
molecule. The products of the cycle only occur because of
the added carbon. What are the products of the Calvin
cycle and what is regenerated?
a.
The product of the Calvin cycle is
glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate and RuBP is
regenerated.
b.
The product of the Calvin cycle is
glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate and RuBisCO is
regenerated.
c.
The product of the Calvin cycle is a 3-PGA
molecule and glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate is
regenerated.
d.
The product of the Calvin cycle is
glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate and oxygen is
regenerated.
31. How do desert plants prevent water loss from the heat,
which would compromise photosynthesis?
a.
by using CAM photosynthesis and by cl
