s behind its own hole, so the holes migrate toward 
the negative electrode. As the electrons tend to accumulate at one side of the
material, the holes tend to accumulate on the opposite side. We will look at this
phenomenon in more detail in the next Section.
Calculating the energy gap. It is found that the conduc-
tivity of a certain semiconductor increases when light of wavelength 345 nm or
shorter strikes it, suggesting that electrons are being promoted from the valence
band to the conduction band. What is the energy gap,
for this semiconductor?
APPROACH The longest wavelength (lowest energy) photon to cause an
increase in conductivity has 
and its energy 
equals the
energy gap.
SOLUTION The gap energy equals the energy of a 
photon:
Which is transparent? The energy gap
for silicon is 1.12 eV at room temperature, whereas that of zinc sulfide (ZnS) is
3.6 eV. Which one of these is opaque to visible light, and which is transparent?
RESPONSE Visible-light photons span energies from rou
