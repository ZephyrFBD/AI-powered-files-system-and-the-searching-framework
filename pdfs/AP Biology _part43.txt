ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
All living organisms are made up of organic compounds, compounds that
contain carbon. The number of different carbon compounds is vast because
carbon can form single, double, or triple covalent bonds. It can form
molecules that are ring shaped, branched, or long chains. There are four
classes of organic compounds: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and
nucleic acids.

Carbohydrates
The body uses carbohydrates for fuel and as building materials.
Carbohydrates consist of three elements: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
The ratio of the number of hydrogen atoms to the number of oxygen atoms
in all carbohydrates is always 2 to 1. The empirical formula for all
carbohydrates is CnH2O. The body uses carbohydrates for quick energy; 1
gram of any carbohydrate will release 4 calories when burned in a
calorimeter. Dietary sources include rice, pasta, bread, cookies, and candy.
