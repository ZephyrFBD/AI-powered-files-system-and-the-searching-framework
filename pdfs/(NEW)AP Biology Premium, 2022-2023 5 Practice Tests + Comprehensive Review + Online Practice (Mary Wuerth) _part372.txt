Figure 16.7 Flow of Genetic Information in a Eukaryotic Cell
Some viruses contain RNA as their primary carrier of genetic information. These retroviruses contain the
enzyme reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcriptase makes a DNA copy of the RNA genome of the virus. This
DNA copy is then inserted into the genome of the host cell that is infected by the virus. The host cell will then
transcribe and translate the information in the viral DNA inserted into the host cell’s genome. Reverse transcriptase
is less accurate than RNA polymerase, so retroviruses have a relatively high mutation rate.
