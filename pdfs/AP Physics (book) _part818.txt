angular acceleration of the door is proportional 
not only to the magnitude of the force, but is also directly proportional to 
the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the line along which the
force acts. This distance is called the lever arm, or moment arm, of the force,
and is labeled 
and 
for the two forces in Fig. 8–10. Thus, if 
in Fig. 8–10
is three times larger than 
then the angular acceleration of the door will be
three times as great, assuming that the magnitudes of the forces are the same.
To say it another way, if 
then 
must be three times as large as 
to
give the same angular acceleration. (Figure 8–11 shows two examples of tools
whose long lever arms are very effective.)
The angular acceleration, then, is proportional to the product of the force
times the lever arm. This product is called the moment of the force about the 
axis, or, more commonly, it is called the torque, and is represented by 
(Greek
lowercase letter tau). Thus, the angular acceleration
