vity in both
archaea and eukaryotes is not inhibited by these antibiotics. In bacteria, ribosome activity is inhibited by these
antibiotics.
2. Introns are present in the genes of eukaryotes and some archaea, but are absent in bacteria.
 
Many archaea live in extreme habitats (very salty, very hot, or very acidic), but others live in the same habitats as
bacteria.
Domain Eukarya
The Eukarya are eukaryotes. The four kingdoms, their characteristics, and some important taxa are described in the
following discussion.
Kingdom Protista
Organisms in this kingdom may be algae-like, animal-like, fungus-like, unicellular, or multicellular. In many cases,
the evolutionary relationships among the various groups are either very weak, poorly understood, or both. Thus, this
kingdom is artificial and is used more for convenience than to present actual evolutionary relationships. Features
shared by two or more groups may represent convergent evolution; that is, the features arose among the groups
