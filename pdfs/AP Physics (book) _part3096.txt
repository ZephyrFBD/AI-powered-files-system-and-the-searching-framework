 photon produces an electron and a
positron, each with a kinetic energy of 285 keV. Determine
the energy and wavelength of the photon.

38. (I) Calculate the wavelength of a 0.21-kg ball traveling at
39. (I) What is the wavelength of a neutron 
traveling at 
40. (II) Through how many volts of potential difference must
an electron, initially at rest, be accelerated to achieve a
wavelength of 0.27 nm?
41. (II) Calculate the ratio of the kinetic energy of an electron
to that of a proton if their wavelengths are equal. Assume
that the speeds are nonrelativistic.
42. (II) An 
electron 
has 
a 
de 
Broglie 
wavelength
(a) What is its momentum? (b) What
is its speed? (c) What voltage was needed to accelerate it
from rest to this speed?
43. (II) What is the wavelength of an electron of energy
(a) 10 eV, (b) 100 eV, (c) 1.0 keV?
44. (II) Show that if an electron and a proton have the same
nonrelativistic kinetic energy, the proton has the shorter
wavelength.
