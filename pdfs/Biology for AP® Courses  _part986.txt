the cytochrome complex.
38. Why do the light-dependent reactions of
photosynthesis take place in the thylakoid?
a.
Photosystem I is anchored to the membrane, but
not photosystem II.
b.
The cytochrome complex requires a membrane
for chemiosmosis to occur.
c.
The light-dependent reactions depend on the
presence of carbon dioxide.
d.
Light energy is absorbed by the thylakoid
membrane.
39. Metabolic pathways both produce and use energy to
perform their reactions. How does the Calvin cycle help to
harness, store, and use energy in its pathway?
a.
The Calvin cycle harnesses energy in the form of
6 ATP and 6 NADPH that are used to produce
Fructose-3- phosphate (F3P) molecules. These
store the energy captured from photosynthesis.
The cycle uses this energy to regenerate RuBP.
b.
The Calvin cycle harnesses energy in the form of
6 ATP and 6 NADPH that are used to produce
Glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate (GA3P)
molecules. These store the energy captured from
photosynthesis. The cycle uses this energy
