heir chance to survive. However, the
underlying principle remains that all organisms must harvest energy from their environment and convert it
to ATP to carry out cellular functions.
The early atmosphere lacked oxygen. Why do you think this is the case?
a.
Oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis, so there was very little oxygen in the atmosphere until
photosynthetic organisms evolved.
b.
Oxygen is a byproduct of anaerobic respiration, so there was very little oxygen in the atmosphere until
anaerobic organisms evolved.
c.
Oxygen is a byproduct of fermentation, so there was very little oxygen in the atmosphere until fermentative
organisms evolved.
Anabolic and Catabolic Pathways
Anabolic pathways require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones. Synthesizing sugar from
CO2 is one example. Other examples are the synthesis of large proteins from amino acid building blocks, and the synthesis
of new DNA strands from nucleic acid building blocks. These biosynthetic
