s lighter, and those with darker
coloration may fare better on darker backgrounds. Researchers
used a nontoxic paint to color the backs of lizards with similar
natural colorations and placed them in environments that
matched their color (“matched”) or that conflicted with their color
(“mismatched”). The figure below shows the proportion of lizards
in each treatment group that were recaptured (i.e., still alive) aȇer
16 days.

Assume that males and females reproduce at a similar rate.
According to Darwin’s theory of natural selection, which group of
individuals most likely had the highest fitness?
Female lizards painted to resemble their background had the
highest fitness.
