merase, (B), must be present because there
are small chunks and long chunks. If there was not polymerase, then there wouldn’t be small chunks because
nothing new would be made. It is likely that DNA ligase, (C), is missing and couldn’t attach the short Okazaki
fragments and the longer leading strand fragments.
CHAPTER 10 DRILL: NATURAL SELECTION
1.
D
Mammals and cephalopods developed similar eye structures independently due to similar selective pressures.
This is an example of convergent evolution.
2.
B
The data provided show a transition toward one extreme (black) and away from another (white). This is an
example of directional selection.
3.
B
Based on the data, the number of white-bodied pepper moths decreased between 1802 and 1902, and the
number of black-bodied pepper moths increased during the same period.
4.
B
Longtail moths were included in the experiment as a control to compare the effects that are not associated with
color.
5.
B
If the color of ash or soot produced by the Indu
