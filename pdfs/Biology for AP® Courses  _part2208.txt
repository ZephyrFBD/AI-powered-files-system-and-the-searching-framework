a gene: A and a. The population being
studies has no emigration or immigration. Which type of
evolution is likely occurring here and is the allele selected
for, neutral, or selected against by natural selection?
a.
non-random mating; both alleles are favored
b.
gene flow; allele A is favored
c.
genetic drift; both alleles are neutral
d.
natural selection; allele a is not favored
36. The graph below shows the change in gene frequency
of the two alleles: A and B. These alleles are located on
separate genes that do not influence each other in any way.
The population being studied has no emigration or
immigration. Which type of evolution is likely occurring
here, if at all? Explain how you know.
