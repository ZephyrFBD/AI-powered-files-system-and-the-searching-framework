inusoidal character
of the waves is shown in Fig. 22â€“7, which displays the field directions and magni-
tudes plotted as a function of position along the direction of wave travel. Notice
that 
and 
are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave travel.
We call these waves electromagnetic (EM) waves. They are transverse waves
because the amplitude is perpendicular to the direction of wave travel. However,
EM waves are always waves of fields, not of matter (like waves on water or a
rope). Because they are fields, EM waves can propagate in empty space.
As we have seen, EM waves are produced by electric charges that are oscil-
lating, and hence are undergoing acceleration. In fact, we can say in general that
accelerating electric charges give rise to electromagnetic waves.
Maxwell derived a formula for the speed of EM waves:
(22;2)
where c is the special symbol for the speed of electromagnetic waves in empty
space, and E and B are the magnitudes of electric and magnetic fields
