ation about 
jellyfish that glow in the dark. What makes bioluminescent jellyfish, Aequorea victoria, 
easy to spot in deep, dark water is the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). 
The GFP gene can be transferred into bacteria, and if transformation is successful, the 
bacteria will express their newly acquired jellyfish gene and glow brilliant green under 
ultraviolet (UV) light. 
Ask students to discuss the following question:  
Suppose you have a plasmid that contains both the gene for GFP (pGLO) and a gene  
for resistance to ampicillin (pAMP). How will you be able to tell if bacterial cells have 
been transformed using the plasmid containing genes for GFP and ampicillin resistance? 
Take this a step further by having students examine the plasmid in Figure 3 and the 
corresponding caption.
