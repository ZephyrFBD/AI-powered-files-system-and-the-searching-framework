equate this expression with Eq. 19–2,

[series] (19;3)
When we put several resistances in series, the total or equivalent resistance 
is the sum of the separate resistances. (Sometimes we call it “net resistance.”)
This sum applies to any number of resistances in series. Note that when you add
more resistance to the circuit, the current through the circuit will decrease. For
example, if a 12-V battery is connected to a 
resistor, the current will be 3 A.
But if the 12-V battery is connected to three 
resistors in series, the total 
resistance is 
and the current through the entire circuit will be only 1 A.
Another way to connect resistors is in parallel, so that the current from the source
splits into separate branches or paths (Fig.19–4a). Wiring in houses and buildings is
arranged so all electric devices are in parallel, as we saw in Chapter 18, Fig. 18–20.
With parallel wiring, if you disconnect one device (say,
in Fig. 19–4a), the cur-
rent to the other devices is not inter
