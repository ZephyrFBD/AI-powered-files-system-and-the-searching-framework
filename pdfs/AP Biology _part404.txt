bral column, hinged
jaws, four walking legs, amnion, and the development of hair. All animals
share characteristics with their ancestors and also differ from them. In this
tree, all the animals (except the lancelets) share a vertebral column. That
trait is known as a shared ancestral trait or character. In contrast, each
animal in one clade or lineage has a trait that is not shared with their
ancestors. That new trait is known as a shared derived trait or character.
For example, hair in the leopard (and in all mammals) is a derived trait.

CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter was an introduction to Big Idea: EVO.
Our current system of classification is based on DNA analysis and
