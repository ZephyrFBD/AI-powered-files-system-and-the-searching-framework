 (a) By using the bond enthalpy for Cl2 (Table 8.4), de-
termine the longest wavelength of light that is ener-
getic enough to cause reaction 2 to occur. In which 
portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is this light 
found? (b) By using the data tabulated here, sketch a 
quantitative energy proﬁle for the catalyzed reaction 
represented by reactions 3 and 4. (c) By using bond en-
thalpies, estimate where the reactants, CH41g2 + Cl21g2, 
should be placed on your diagram in part (b). Use 
this result to estimate the value of Ea for the reaction 
CH41g2 + Cl21g2 ¡ CH31g2 + HCl1g2 + Cl1g2. (d) The 
species Cl(g) and CH31g2 in reactions 3 and 4 are radicals, 
that is, atoms or molecules with unpaired electrons. Draw 
a Lewis structure of CH3, and verify that it is a radical. 
(e) The sequence of reactions 3 and 4 comprises a radi-
cal chain mechanism. Why do you think this is called a 
“chain reactio
