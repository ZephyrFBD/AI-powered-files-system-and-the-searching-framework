al structures that are often found within microtubule organizing centers
(MTOCs). Centrioles are most active during cellular division. When a cell is ready to divide, the centrioles produce
microtubules, which pull the replicated chromosomes apart and move them to opposite ends of the cell. Although
centrioles are common in animal cells, they are not found in most types of plant cells.
Vacuoles
In Latin, the term vacuole means “empty cavity.” But vacuoles are far from empty. They are fluid-filled sacs that
store water, food, wastes, salts, or pigments.
Peroxisomes
Peroxisomes are organelles that detoxify various substances, producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a byproduct.
They also contain enzymes that break down hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. In animals, they are common
in liver and kidney cells.
Cytoskeleton
Have you ever wondered what actually holds the cell together and enables it to keep its shape? The shape of a cell is
determined by a network of protein fibers called
