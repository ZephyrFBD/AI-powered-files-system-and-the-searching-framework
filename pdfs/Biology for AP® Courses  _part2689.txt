eceptors allow
plants to gauge the direction and abundance of sunlight, which is rich in blueâ€“green emissions. Water absorbs red light,
which makes the detection of blue light essential for algae and aquatic plants.
The Phytochrome System and the Red/Far-Red Response
The phytochromes are a family of chromoproteins with a linear tetrapyrrole chromophore, similar to the ringed tetrapyrrole
light-absorbing head group of chlorophyll. Phytochromes have two photo-interconvertible forms: Pr and Pfr. Pr absorbs red
light (~667 nm) and is immediately converted to Pfr. Pfr absorbs far-red light (~730 nm) and is quickly converted back to
Pr. Absorption of red or far-red light causes a massive change to the shape of the chromophore, altering the conformation
and activity of the phytochrome protein to which it is bound. Pfr is the physiologically active form of the protein; therefore,
exposure to red light yields physiological activity. Exposure to far-red light inhibits phytochrome activity. Toget
