nd bisulfates (or hydrogen 
sulfates, HSO4
-  salts). Bisulfate salts are common components of the “dry acids” used for 
adjusting the pH of swimming pools and hot tubs; they are also components of many 
toilet bowl cleaners.
Another important sulfur-containing ion is thiosulfate ion 1S2O3
2 -2. The term thio 
indicates substitution of sulfur for oxygen. The structures of the sulfate and thiosulfate 
ions are compared in Figure 22.19.
Thiols, organic compounds with a —SH group bonded to carbon, play import-
ant roles in biology. When thiols are oxidized under mild conditions, they form 
disulfides, organic compounds with S—S bonds between carbon atoms. In the 
opposite fashion, disulfide bonds can be broken by reducing them to thiols. The 
shape and function of proteins can be modified by forming or breaking disulfide 
bonds between protein strands. Hair-straightening and curling technologies rely on 
the breaking and re-forming of disulfide bonds between the protein molecules of 
hair
