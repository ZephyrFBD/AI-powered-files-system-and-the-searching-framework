to determine the molecular formula of a gas from 
elemental analysis data and data on its properties. Then we need 
to predict the structure of the molecule and from that, its polarity.
 
Plan We can use the percentage composition of the com-
pound to calculate its empirical formula. 
  (Section 3.5) 
Then we can determine the molecular formula by compar-
ing the mass of the empirical formula with the molar mass. 
  (Section 3.5)
Solve To determine the empirical formula, we assume we have a 
100-g sample and calculate the number of moles of each element 
in the sample:
 Moles C = 146.2 g C2a 1 mol C
12.01 g C b = 3.85 mol C
  Moles N = 153.8 g N2a 1 mol N
14.01 g N b = 3.84 mol N
Because the ratio of the moles of the two elements is essentially 
1:1, the empirical formula is CN. To determine the molar mass, we 
use Equation 10.11.

The molar mass associated with the empirical formula CN is
