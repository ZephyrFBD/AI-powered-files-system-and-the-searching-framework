ith fungicide for all
four plant species. Thus, the use of fungicide decreased shoot biomass.
Figure 2 also shows for all four species that the lengths of the white bars,
which represent treatment + isolated plants, are shorter than those of the
gray bars, which represent treatment + neighbors. Similarly, the lengths of
the striped bars, which represent no treatment + isolated plants, are shorter
than those of the black bars, which represent no treatment + neighbors.
Therefore, the presence of neighbors increases shoot biomass.
