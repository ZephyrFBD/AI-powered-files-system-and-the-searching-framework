t charge resulting from the loss of one, two, and three electrons, 
respectively. The superscripts -, 2-, and 3- represent net charges resulting from the gain 
of one, two, and three electrons, respectively. Chlorine, with 17 protons and 17 electrons, 
for example, can gain an electron in chemical reactions, producing the Cl- ion:
In general, metal atoms tend to lose electrons to form cations and nonmetal atoms  
tend to gain electrons to form anions. Thus, ionic compounds tend to be composed  
of both metal cations and nonmetal anions, as in NaCl.

Writing Chemical Symbols for Ions
Give the chemical symbol, including superscript indicating mass number, for (a) the ion with 22 protons, 26 neutrons,  
and 19 electrons; and (b) the ion of sulfur that has 16 neutrons and 18 electrons.
