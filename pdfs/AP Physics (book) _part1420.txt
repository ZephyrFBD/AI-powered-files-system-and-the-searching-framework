EXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 359, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.
EXERCISE B An ideal gas is contained in a steel sphere at 27.0°C and 1.00 atm absolute
pressure. If no gas is allowed to escape and the temperature is raised to 127°C, what will
be the new pressure? (a) 0.21 atm; (b) 0.75 atm; (c) 1.00 atm; (d) 1.33 atm; (e) 4.7 atm.
13–7 Problem Solving with the
Ideal Gas Law
The ideal gas law is an extremely useful tool, and we now consider some Examples.
We will often refer to “standard conditions” or standard temperature and pressure
(STP), which means:
and
P = 1.00 atm = 1.013 * 105 Nm2 = 101.3 kPa.
T = 273 K (0°C)
