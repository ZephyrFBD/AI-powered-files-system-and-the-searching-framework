tein is to other organisms, which includes humans, mice, etc. The database is
searched for the specified sequence and the results are listed by their percentage similarity.
You may be asked to interpret data from a BLAST search that indicates the percentage similarities,
just like the above chart. The skill is still the same: the higher the percentage similarity, the closer they
should be mapped on the cladogram.

Analysis Question: What causes plants to wilt if you forget to water them?
Exercise 4A:
 Watering Plants and Turgor Pressure
Interpretation of this Exercise
Normally, when a plant has enough water supply, the cell has enough water to “feed” itself as well
as enough water to store in its vacuoles. These vacuoles, full of water, are what help the leaves stay
more stiff by creating turgor pressure. So when a plant does not get watered for quite a while and
begins to wilt, the plant has begun drawing water out of the plant’s syst
