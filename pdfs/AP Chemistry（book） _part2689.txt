to decrease and 3A-4 to increase. As long as the 
amounts of HA and A- in the buffer are large relative to the amount of OH- added, the 
ratio 3HA4>3A-4 does not change much and, thus, the change in pH is small.
If H+ ions are added, they react with the base component of the buffer:
 
H+1aq2 + A-1aq2 ¡ HA1aq2  
[17.7]
This reaction can also be represented using H3O+:
H3O+1aq2 + A-1aq2 ¡ HA1aq2 + H2O1l2
Using either equation, we see that this reaction causes 3A-4 to decrease and 3HA4 to in-
crease. As long as the change in the ratio 3HA4>3A-4 is small, the change in pH will be small.
An example of an HA>A- buffer is the HF>F- buffered solution shown in Figure 17.2. 
The buffer consists of equal concentrations of hydrofluoric acid, HF, and fluoride ion,
