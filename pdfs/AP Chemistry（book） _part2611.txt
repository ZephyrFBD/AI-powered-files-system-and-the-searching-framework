Give It Some Thought
Which acid has the larger acid-dissociation constant, HIO2 or HBrO3?
Arrange the compounds in each series in order of increasing acid strength: (a) AsH3, HBr, KH, H2Se; (b) H2SO4, H2SeO3, H2SeO4.
Sample Exercise 16.20 
Predicting Relative Acidities from Composition and Structure
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to arrange two sets of compounds in order 
from weakest acid to strongest acid. In (a), the substances are 
binary compounds containing H, and in (b) the substances are 
oxyacids.
Plan For the binary compounds, we will consider the electroneg-
ativities of As, Br, K, and Se relative to the electronegativity of 
H. The higher the electronegativity of these atoms, the higher 
the partial positive charge on H and so the more acidic the 
compound.
For the oxyacids, we will consider both the electronegativities 
of the central atom and the number of oxygen atoms bonded to 
the central atom.

(a) Because K is on the left side of the periodic table, it ha
