is could also lead to the increased transcription and aberrant gene expression that is seen in cancer cells.
Researchers have been investigating how to control the transcriptional activation of gene expression in cancer. Identifying
how a transcription factor binds, or a pathway that activates where a gene can be turned off, has led to new drugs and
new ways to treat cancer. In breast cancer, for example, many proteins are overexpressed. This can lead to increased
phosphorylation of key transcription factors that increase transcription. One such example is the overexpression of the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in a subset of breast cancers. The EGFR pathway activates many protein kinases
that, in turn, activate many transcription factors that control genes involved in cell growth. New drugs that prevent the

activation of EGFR have been developed and are used to treat these cancers.
