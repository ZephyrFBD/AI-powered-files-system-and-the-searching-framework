Mole Fraction, Molarity, and Molality
Concentration expressions are often based on the number of moles of one or more com-
ponents of the solution. Recall from Section 10.6 that the mole fraction of a component of 
a solution is given by
 
Mole fraction of component =
moles of component
total moles of all components 
[13.7]
The symbol X is commonly used for mole fraction, with a subscript to indicate the 
component of interest. For example, the mole fraction of HCl in a hydrochloric acid 
solution is represented as XHCl. Thus, if a solution contains 1.00 mol of HCl 136.5 g2 
and 8.00 mol of water 1144 g2, the mole fraction of HCl is XHCl = 11.00 mol2>
11.00 mol + 8.00 mol2 = 0.111. Mole fractions have no units because the units 
in the numerator and the denominator cancel. The sum of the mole fractions of 
all components of a solution must equal 1. Thus, in the aqueous HCl solution, 
XH2O = 1.000 - 0.111 = 0.889. Mole fractions are very useful when dealing with gases,
