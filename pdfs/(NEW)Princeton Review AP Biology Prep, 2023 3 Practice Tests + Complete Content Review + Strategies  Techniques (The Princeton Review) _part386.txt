onsistent small
changes in DNA and changes in the fossil record. We can see evolution of resistance to antibiotics, pesticides,
herbicides, or chemotherapy drugs since these are particularly strong selective pressures. We can also see how
fast replicating pathogens evolve and cause emergent diseases never before seen.
Across every domain, there are certain universal molecules and structures.
Many metabolic pathways are also conserved and vary only a little between
species.
COMMON ANCESTRY
By using the evidence mentioned above, scientists can get a good handle on how evolution of certain species
occurred. Structural evidence indicates common ancestry of all living eukaryotes based on membrane-bound
organelles, linear chromosomes, and genes that contain introns. It all comes down to who has common ancestors.
Life started somewhere. Some original life-form is the common ancestor to all life, but where things went from
there can become quite convoluted.
Scientists use charts called phyloge
