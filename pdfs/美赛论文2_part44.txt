ions to establish the Spread Model. The 
basic model is model 1, in this model we suppose that EVA spreads in the 
absence of any additional medication, which means λ (The number of 
susceptible people infected by one infective person every week) and μ (the 
proportion of dead and cured people in patients every week) are constant. The 
two improved models take the function of the drugs and the vaccine into 
consideration. In the improved models, the amounts of vaccines used on the 
susceptible people are related to λ, the amounts of drugs used on the infective 
people have relationship with μ, both λ and μ change with time. In improved 
modeⅠ, we only consider the influence of the vaccines and in improved 
modelⅡ, we take the influence of both the drugs and the vaccines into 
consideration). As a result, the two improved models are more realistic.  
4.2 Production model: 
Due to the restrictions with technology, supply is supposed to be less than 
demand at the beginning. In such situa
