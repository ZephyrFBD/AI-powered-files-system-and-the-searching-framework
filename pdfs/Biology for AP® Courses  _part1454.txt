The Chromosome 18 Inversion
Not all structural rearrangements of chromosomes produce nonviable, impaired, or infertile individuals. In
rare instances, such a change can result in the evolution of a new species. In fact, a pericentric inversion in
chromosome 18 appears to have contributed to the evolution of humans. This inversion is not present in our
closest genetic relatives, the chimpanzees. Humans and chimpanzees differ cytogenetically by pericentric
inversions on several chromosomes and by the fusion of two separate chromosomes in chimpanzees that
correspond to chromosome two in humans.
The pericentric chromosome 18 inversion is believed to have occurred in early humans following their
divergence from a common ancestor with chimpanzees approximately five million years ago. Researchers
characterizing this inversion have suggested that approximately 19,000 nucleotide bases were duplicated
