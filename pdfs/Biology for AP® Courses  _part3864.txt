b.
osmoregulator, because it would need to prevent
solutes from leaving its body to remain alive
c.
osmoconformer, because it would need to
prevent solutes from leaving its body to remain
alive
d.
osmoregulator, because it would need to prevent
water from leaving its body to remain alive.
32. Why is excretion important in order to achieve osmotic
balance?
a.
The body accumulates water within itself when
excretion does not occur, which can have dire
consequences.
b.
Excretion regulates the movement of water
within the membranes, which ultimately
maintains osmotic balance.
c.
In the absence of excretion, there is a shift in the
concentrations, which disrupts osmotic balance.
d.
The body builds up many chemical compounds
that need to be excreted to maintain homeostasis
and osmotic balance.
33. What is the structure of the nephron?
a.
The nephron consists of three parts: the
glomerulus, the renal tubule, and the associated
capillary network originating from the cortical
radiate
