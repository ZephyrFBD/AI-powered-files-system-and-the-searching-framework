Important Points of this Laboratory
Smaller pieces of DNA migrated faster and therefore are farther on the gel.
The electrical current running through the buffer separates the DNA based on size. DNA is
negatively charged; therefore, it migrates toward the positive end.
If the restriction enzymes recognition site is mutated, the enzyme will not cut the DNA properly. The
result will be the incorrect number and size of bands on the gel.

Analysis Question: What factors govern energy capture, allocation, storage, and transfer between
producers and consumers in a terrestrial ecosystem?
Exercise 10A:  Producers and Consumers
Interpretation of this Experiment
In this experiment, brussels sprouts were fed to butterfly larvae and the energy and biomass flows
were calculated at 12 days, 15 days, and after 3 days of growth. Most of the mass of the brussels sprout
is water, which is an important product for the larvae to consume; therefore,
