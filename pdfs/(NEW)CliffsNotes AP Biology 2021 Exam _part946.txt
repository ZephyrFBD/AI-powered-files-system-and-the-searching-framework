 the temperature
must be constant (either 10°C or 25°C). Only time and respiratory rate are allowed to vary. Since respiratory rate is
indirectly measured by changes in the quantity of oxygen consumed, the amount of oxygen in each chamber is
allowed to change. Note that KOH was added to the animal chambers to absorb any
CO2 produced, thus maintaining a constant amount of CO2 in the
chambers.
23. C. A single tree can support large numbers of insects (represented by the second tier of the pyramid), which can,
in turn, support many birds
(or other insects) that eat the insects. One or two large predators, such as hawks, may occupy the fourth tier.
24. A. A deletion or an addition of a nucleotide in a DNA strand that codes for mRNA produces a frameshift
mutation. As a result, the first nucleotide in every codon will become the second, the second nucleotide will become
the third, and the third nucleotide will become the first nucleotide of the next codon. Such an arrangement is likely
