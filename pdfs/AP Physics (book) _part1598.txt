hermodynamics is the name we give to the study of processes in which
energy is transferred as heat and as work.
In Chapter 6 we saw that work is done when energy is transferred from one
object to another by mechanical means. In Chapter 14 we saw that heat is a trans-
fer of energy from one object to a second one at a lower temperature. Thus, heat
is much like work. To distinguish them, heat is defined as a transfer of energy due
to a difference in temperature, whereas work is a transfer of energy that is not due
to a temperature difference.
In discussing thermodynamics, we often refer to particular systems. A system
is any object or set of objects that we wish to consider (see Section 14–4). Every-
thing else in the universe is referred to as its “environment” or the “surroundings.”
In this Chapter, we examine the two great laws of thermodynamics. The first
law of thermodynamics relates work and heat transfers to the change in internal
energy of a
