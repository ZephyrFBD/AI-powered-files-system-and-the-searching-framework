communities where seawater comes in contact with super-hot rock, H2S, and O2. In these unique communities,
chemoautotrophic prokaryotes live
 
mutualisti-cally in specialized organs of large (1.5 m long) tube worms. The
 
tube worms absorb dissolved H2S and O2 and transport it to the prokaryotes, where they use the free energy from
H2S to produce
 
carbohydrates.
Ecological pyramids are used to show the relationship between trophic levels. Horizontal bars or tiers are used to
represent the relative sizes of trophic levels, each represented in terms of energy (also called productivity), biomass,
or numbers of organisms. The tiers are stacked upon one another in the order in which energy is transferred between
levels. The result is usually a pyramid-shaped figure, although other shapes may also result. Several kinds of
ecological pyramids are illustrated in Figure 16-7.
