solubilities. Nevertheless, 
insight into variations in solubility can often be gained by focusing on the interaction 
between the solute and solvent. The data in Table 13.1 show that the solubilities of 
various gases in water increase with increasing molecular mass. The attractive forces 
between the gas molecules and solvent molecules are mainly dispersion forces, which 
increase with increasing size and molecular mass. 
 (Section 11.2) Thus, the data 
indicate that the solubilities of gases in water increase as the attraction between solute 
(gas) and solvent (water) increases. In general, when other factors are comparable, the 
stronger the attractions between solute and solvent molecules, the greater the solubility of the 
solute in that solvent.
Because of favorable dipoleâ€“dipole attractions between polar solvent molecules and 
polar solute molecules, polar liquids tend to dissolve in polar solvents. Water is both polar 
and able to form hydrogen bonds.
