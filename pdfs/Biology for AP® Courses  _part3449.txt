st periodically shed their exoskeletons because the exoskeleton does not grow as the organism grows.

Endoskeleton
An endoskeleton is a skeleton that consists of hard, mineralized structures located within the soft tissue of organisms. An
example of a primitive endoskeletal structure is the spicules of sponges. The bones of vertebrates are composed of tissues,
whereas sponges have no true tissues (Figure 29.4). Endoskeletons provide support for the body, protect internal organs,
and allow for movement through contraction of muscles attached to the skeleton.

The human skeleton is an endoskeleton that consists of 206 bones in the adult. It has five main functions: providing support
to the body, storing minerals and lipids, producing bloo
