 circulates in the blood and reacts with a plasma protein produced by the liver called angiotensinogen.
When angiotensinogen is cleaved by renin, it produces angiotensin I, which is then converted into angiotensin II in the
lungs. Angiotensin II functions as a hormone and then causes the release of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal cortex,
resulting in increased Na+ reabsorption, water retention, and an increase in blood pressure. Angiotensin II in addition to
being a potent vasoconstrictor also causes an increase in ADH and increased thirst, both of which help to raise blood
pressure.
Figure 28.7 ADH and aldosterone increase blood pressure and volume. Angiotensin II stimulates release of these
hormones. Angiotensin II, in turn, is formed when renin cleaves angiotensinogen. (credit: modification of work by

Hormonal Regulation of the Reproductive System
Regulation of the reproductive system is a process that requires the action of hormones from the pituitary gland
