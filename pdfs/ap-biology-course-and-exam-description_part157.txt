If A and B are independent, then:
P (A and B) = P (A) times P (B)

LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain deviations from 
Mendel’s model of the 
inheritance of traits.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.J.1
Patterns of inheritance of many traits do not 
follow ratios predicted by Mendel’s laws and 
can be identified by quantitative analysis, 
where observed phenotypic ratios statistically 
differ from the predicted ratios—
a. Genes that are adjacent and close to 
one another on the same chromosome 
may appear to be genetically linked; the 
probability that genetically linked genes will 
segregate as a unit can be used to calculate 
the ma
