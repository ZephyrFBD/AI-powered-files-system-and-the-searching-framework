remains mismatched, special repair enzymes can often recognize the wrongly incorporated base, excise it from the DNA,
and replace it with the correct base. Most mistakes are corrected, but if they are not they may result in a mutation, which
is defined as a permanent change in a DNA sequence. A mutation can be passed to daughter cells through DNA replication
and cell division. There are several types of DNA mutations, including substitution, deletion, insertion, and translocation.
Mutations in repair genes may lead to serious consequences, such as cancer. Mutations can be induced by environmental
factors, such as UV radiation, or they can occur spontaneously. (We will explore the effects of mutation in more detail in a
later chapter. Remember that mutations are not always detrimental. They can be beneficial, too. Changes in DNA increase
genetic variationâ€”the foundation of evolution by natural selection.)
