What is the intensity of that wave if detected 400 km from the
source?
APPROACH We assume the wave is spherical, so the intensity decreases as the
square of the distance from the source.
SOLUTION At 400 km the distance is 4 times greater than at 100 km, so the
intensity will be
of its value at 100 km, or
NOTE Using Eq. 11â€“16c directly gives:
The situation is different for a one-dimensional wave, such as a transverse
wave on a string or a longitudinal wave pulse traveling down a thin uniform metal
rod. The area remains constant, so the amplitude A also remains constant (ignoring
friction). Thus the amplitude and the intensity do not decrease with distance.
In practice, frictional damping is generally present, and some of the energy 
is transformed into thermal energy. Thus the amplitude and intensity of a 
one-dimensional wave will decrease with distance from the source. For a
three-dimensional wave, the decrease will be greater than that discussed above,
more than 
although the
