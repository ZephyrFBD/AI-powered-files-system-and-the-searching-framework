 Secondary active transport occurs when something is actively transported
using the energy captured from the movement of another substance flowing down its concentration gradient.
We’ve now seen that small substances can cross the cell membrane by:
simple diffusion
facilitated transport
active transport
Endocytosis
When the particles that want to enter a cell are just too large, the cell uses a portion of the cell membrane to engulf
the substance. The cell membrane forms a pocket, pinches in, and eventually forms either a vacuole or a vesicle.
This process is called endocytosis.
Three types of endocytosis exist: pinocytosis, phagocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis. In pinocytosis,
the cell ingests liquids (“cell-drinking”). In phagocytosis, the cell takes in solids (“cell-eating”). A special type of
endocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis, involves cell surface receptors that work in tandem with endocytic pits
that are lined with a protein called clathrin. When a particle, o
