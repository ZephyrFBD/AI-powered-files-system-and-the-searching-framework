pher of quantum mechanics was Bohr. He
argued that a space–time description of actual atoms and electrons is not possible.
Yet a description of experiments on atoms or electrons must be given in terms of
space and time and other concepts familiar to ordinary experience, such as waves
and particles. We must not let our descriptions of experiments lead us into believ-
ing that atoms or electrons themselves actually move in space and time as classical
particles.
28–5 Quantum-Mechanical View 
of Atoms
At the beginning of this Chapter, we discussed the limitations of the Bohr model
of atomic structure. Now we examine the quantum-mechanical theory of atoms,
which is a far more complete theory than the old Bohr model. Although the Bohr
model has been discarded as an accurate description of nature, nonetheless, quan-
tum mechanics reaffirms certain aspects of the older theory, such as that electrons
in an atom exist only in discrete states of definite energy, and that a photon of
light is emit
