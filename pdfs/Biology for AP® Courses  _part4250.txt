ge. It is common for reports and discussions about global climate change to confuse the data showing
that Earth’s climate is changing with the factors that drive this climate change.
Evidence for Global Climate Change
Since scientists cannot go back in time to directly measure climatic variables, such as average temperature and precipitation,
they must instead indirectly measure temperature. To do this, scientists rely on historical evidence of Earth’s past climate.
Antarctic ice cores are a key example of such evidence. These ice cores are samples of polar ice obtained by means of
drills that reach thousands of meters into ice sheets or high mountain glaciers. Viewing the ice cores is like traveling
backwards through time; the deeper the sample, the earlier the time period. Trapped within the ice are bubbles of air and
other biological evidence that can reveal temperature and carbon dioxide data. Antarctic ice cores have been collected
and analyzed to indirectly estimate the temperatu
