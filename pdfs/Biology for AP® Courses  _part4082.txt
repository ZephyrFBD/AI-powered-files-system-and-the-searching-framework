omosomes, only one sperm must fuse with one egg. In mammals, the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular
matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida. When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida, a
series of biochemical events, called the acrosomal reactions, take place. In placental mammals, the acrosome contains
digestive enzymes that initiate the degradation of the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma
membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane, as illustrated in Figure 34.20b. The fusion of these two membranes
creates an opening through which the sperm nucleus is transferred into the ovum. The nuclear membranes of the egg and
sperm break down and the two haploid genomes condense to form a diploid genome.
