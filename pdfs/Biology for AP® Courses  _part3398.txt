 controlled by antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is produced in the hypothalamus and
triggers the reabsorption of water by the kidneys. Underproduction of ADH can cause diabetes insipidus. Aldosterone, a
hormone produced by the adrenal cortex of the kidneys, enhances Na+ reabsorption from the extracellular fluids and
subsequent water reabsorption by diffusion. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is one way that aldosterone release
is controlled.
The reproductive system is controlled by the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone
(LH), which are produced by the pituitary gland. Gonadotropin release is controlled by the hypothalamic hormone
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). FSH stimulates the maturation of sperm cells in males and is inhibited by the
hormone inhibin, while LH stimulates the production of the androgen testosterone. FSH stimulates egg maturation in
females, while LH stimulates the production of estrogens and progesterone. Estrogen
