 its neighbors.
Rarefied gases can also be excited to emit light. This is done by intense 
heating, or more commonly by applying a high voltage to a “discharge tube”
containing the gas at low pressure, Fig. 27–22. The radiation from excited gases
had been observed early in the nineteenth century, and it was found that the
spectrum was not continuous. Rather, excited gases emit light of only certain
wavelengths, and when this light is analyzed through the slit of a spectroscope 
or spectrometer, a line spectrum is seen rather than a continuous spectrum.
The line spectra emitted by a number of elements in the visible region are shown
below in Fig. 27–23, and in Chapter 24, Fig. 24–28. The emission spectrum is
characteristic of the material and can serve as a type of “fingerprint” for
identification of the gas.
We also saw (Chapter 24) that if a continuous spectrum passes through a
rarefied gas, dark lines are observed in the emerging spectrum, at wavelengths
corresponding to lines normal
