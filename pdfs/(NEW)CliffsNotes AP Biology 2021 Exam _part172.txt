during the Calvin cycle
when CO2 combines with RuBP. Photorespiration, in contrast, occurs when O2, instead of CO2, combines with
RuBP. The product of this reaction is transported to a peroxisome, where H2O2 is generated and
subsequently broken down.
 
7. B. The energy-rich products of noncyclic photophosphorylation are ATP and NADPH.
8. A. During cyclic photophosphorylation, electrons energized by sunlight pass along an electron transport chain.
About 1 ATP is generated from ADP and Pi with the energy from 2 electrons. This process can repeat as
long as sunlight is available. H2O (necessary for noncyclic photophosphorylation) and CO2 (necessary for the
Calvin cycle) are not
 
needed for cyclic photophosphorylation.
9. D. Rubisco and the other enzymes that catalyze reactions in the Calvin cycle occur in the stroma. Most of the
pigments and enzymes for photophosphorylation are embedded in the thylakoid membranes. The manganese-
containing protein complex that catalyzes the splitti
