needles, fire adds nitrogen to the soil and limits competition by destroying undergrowth.

Figure 35.11 The mature cones of the jack pine (Pinus banksiana) open only when exposed to high temperatures,
such as during a forest fire. A fire is likely to kill most vegetation, so a seedling that germinates after a fire is more likely
to receive ample sunlight than one that germinates under normal conditions. (credit: USDA)
Abiotic Factors Influencing Plant Growth
Temperature and moisture are important influences on plant production (primary productivity) and the amount of organic
matter available as food (net primary productivity). Net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic
matter available as food; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized
during cellular respiration. In terrestrial environments, net primary productivity is estimated by
