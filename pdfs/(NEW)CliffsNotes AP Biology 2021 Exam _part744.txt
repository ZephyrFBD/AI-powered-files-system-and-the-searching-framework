ation if you
counted 55 redeyed flies and 45 brown-eyed flies from this cross when you expected
50 of each (½ and ½)? To calculate the χ2 statistic, create a contingency table of all the values that are needed to
calculate the χ2 statistic, where
 
O and E represent observed values and expected values, respectively:
 
Next, you need to
determine the degrees of freedom (df) of the data using the formula provided on the equations and formulas pages:
df = number of E values − 1 = 2 − 1 = 1
 
To determine if the observed data values obtained in the fruit fly cross differ from the expected values by chance or
for another reason, you
 
compare your calculated value of χ2 to the table of critical values in the
 
chi-square table provided on the equations and formulas pages:
 
The table provides critical values for χ2 for two
values of probability, p, and at eight different degrees of freedom. A critical value of χ2 at p =
 
0.05 indicates that 95% of the difference between observed and expect
