mperature, whereas the ice of a frozen lake is said to
have a low temperature.
Many properties of matter change with temperature. For example, most mate-
rials expand when their temperature is increased.† An iron beam is longer when
hot than when cold. Concrete roads and sidewalks expand and contract slightly
according to temperature, which is why compressible spacers or expansion joints
(Fig. 13–3) are placed at regular intervals. The electrical resistance of matter
changes with temperature (Chapter 18). So too does the color radiated by objects,
at least at high temperatures: you may have noticed that the heating element of an
electric stove glows with a red color when hot. At higher temperatures, solids such
as iron glow orange or even white. The white light from an incandescent 
lightbulb comes from an extremely hot tungsten wire. The surface temperatures
of the Sun and other stars can be measured by the predominant color (more 
precisely, wavelengths) of light they emit.
