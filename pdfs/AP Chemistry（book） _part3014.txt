 that the expand-
ing gas does work on the surroundings.
One characteristic of an ideal gas is that its internal energy 
depends only on temperature, not on pressure. Thus, when an ideal 
gas expands isothermally, ∆E = 0. Because ∆E = qrev + wrev = 0, we 
see that qrev = -wrev = nRT  ln1V2>V12. Then, using Equation 19.2, 
we can calculate the entropy change in the system:

Let’s calculate the entropy change for 1.00 L of an ideal gas at 1.00 
atm pressure, 0 °C  temperature, expanding to 2.00 L. From the ide-
al-gas equation, we can calculate the number of moles in 1.00 L of an 
ideal gas at 1.00 atm and 0 °C as we did in Chapter 10:
n = PV
RT =

10.08206 L@atm>mol@K21273 K2 = 4.46 * 10-2 mol
The gas constant, R, can also be expressed as 8.314 J>mol@K  
(Table 10.2), and this is the value we must use in Equation 19.3 because 
we want our answer to be expressed in terms of J rather than in L-atm. 
Thus, for the e
