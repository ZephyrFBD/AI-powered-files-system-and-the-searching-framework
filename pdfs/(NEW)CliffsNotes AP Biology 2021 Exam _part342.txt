a
single host species, and others attack similar cells from a range of closely related species. Bacteriophages, or
phages, for example, are viruses that attack only bacteria.
Viruses consist of the following structures:
 
1. A nucleic acid, either RNA or DNA (but not both), contains the hereditary information of the virus. The DNA or
RNA may be doublestranded (dsDNA or dsRNA) or single-stranded (ssDNA or ssRNA). 2. A capsid, or protein
coat, encloses the nucleic acid.
3. An envelope surrounds the capsid of some viruses. Envelopes incorporate phospholipids and proteins obtained
from the cell membrane of the host cell.
Replication of viruses occurs by one of the following two cycles:
1. In the lytic cycle, a virus penetrates the cell membrane of the host and uses the enzymes of the host to produce
viral nucleic acids and viral proteins. The nucleic acids and proteins are then assembled into new viruses, which
subsequently erupt from the host cell, destroying the cell in the process. The
