Decomposers
All organisms at some point must finally yield to decomposers. Decomposers are the organisms that break down
organic matter into simple products. Generally, fungi and bacteria are the decomposers. They serve as the “garbage
collectors” in our environment.
A food chain shows a linear network of links, from producer to apex predator
species. A food web consists of many food chains and shows many paths that
connect plants and animals.
Producers make their own food.
Primary consumers (herbivores) eat producers.
Secondary consumers (carnivores and omnivores) eat producers and primary consumers.
Tertiary consumers eat all of the above.
Decomposers break things down.
Keystone Species
Sometimes one organism is particularly important to an ecosystem. Maybe it is the only producer, or maybe it is the
only thing that keeps a particularly deadly predator in check. Important species like this are called keystone species.
If a keystone species is removed from the ec
