(D) The promoter is the binding site for RNA polymerase. When
RNA polymerase binds to the promoter, transcription occurs. (IST-

(C) The regulator gene codes for the repressor, a protein that inhibits
transcription. In the lac operon, when the repressor binds to the
operator, no transcription can occur. (IST-1)
(B) The repressor inhibits transcription by binding to the operator and
preventing RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter. (IST-1)
