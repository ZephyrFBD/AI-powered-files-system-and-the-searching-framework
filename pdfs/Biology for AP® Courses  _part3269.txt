n the cochlea, the energy causes the basilar membrane to
flex, thereby bending the stereocilia on receptor hair cells. This activates the receptors, which send their auditory neural
signals to the brain.
The vestibular system has five parts that work together to provide the sense of direction, thus helping to maintain balance.
The utricle and saccule measure head orientation: their calcium carbonate crystals shift when the head is tilted, thereby
activating hair cells. The semicircular canals work similarly, such that when the head is turned, the fluid in the canals
bends stereocilia on hair cells. The vestibular hair cells also send signals to the thalamus and to somatosensory cortex, but
also to the cerebellum, the structure above the brainstem that plays a large role in timing and coordination of movement.
27.5 Vision
Vision is the only photo responsive sense. Visible light travels in waves and is a very small slice of the electromagnetic
radiation spectrum. Light waves differ based
