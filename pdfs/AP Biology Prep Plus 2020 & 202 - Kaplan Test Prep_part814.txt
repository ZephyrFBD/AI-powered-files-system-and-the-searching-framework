AP EXPERT NOTE
The AP Biology exam most commonly tests the following concepts
from ecology:
19.1 Contrast exponential and logistic growth models
19.2 Explain how biotic and abiotic factors aﬀect population
The basics of population biology, including abiotic and biotic
factors that aﬀect population size, growth, and decline
1.
Nutrient cycling and energy exchange
2.
POPULATION GROWTH
What do you get if you put one bacterium in a lot of space and give it an
unlimited amount of resources and time to reproduce? You get a whole
lot of bacteria, that’s what! As a matter of fact, you get an exponential rise
in the number of bacteria according to the equation Nt = N0ert, where
Interactions between the diﬀerent levels of environmental
systems (populations, communities, ecosystems, etc.)

Human impact on the global environment

Nt = the number of bacteria at time t,
N0 = the number of bacteria at the beginning,
r = the rate of population growth (a diﬀe
