alculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron if it
is accelerated from rest by 35,000 V as in Fig.27–2. Is it rela-
tivistic? How does its wavelength compare to the size of the
“neck” of the tube, typically 5 cm? Do we have to worry
about diffraction problems blurring the picture on the CRT
screen?
46. (III) A Ferrari with a mass of 1400 kg approaches a freeway
underpass that is 12 m across. At what speed must the car
be moving, in order for it to have a wavelength such that 
it might somehow “diffract” after passing through this
“single slit”? How do these conditions compare to normal
freeway speeds of 30 ms?

47. (II) What voltage is needed to produce electron wavelengths
of 0.26 nm? (Assume that the electrons are nonrelativistic.)

microscope. Estimate the maximum poss
