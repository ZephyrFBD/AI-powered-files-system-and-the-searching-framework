■ Designing and Conducting Independent Investigations 
Students begin by investigating methods to calculate leaf surface area and then 
determine the average number of stomata per square millimeter in a particular kind of 
plant. Several questions about the process of transpiration in plants should emerge from 
the data, including the following: 
•  Do all plants have stomata? Is there a relationship between the number of stomata and 
the environment in which the plant evolved? 
•  Are leaf surface area and the number of stomata related to the rate of transpiration? 
What might happen to the rate of transpiration if the number of leaves or the size of 
leaves is reduced? 
•  Do all parts of a plant transpire? 
•  Do all plants transpire at the same rate? Is there a relationship between the habitat in 
which plants evolved to their rate of transpiration? 
•  What other factors, including environmental variabl
