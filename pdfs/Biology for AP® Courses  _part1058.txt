Within-cell signaling allows bacteria to respond to environmental cues, such as nutrient levels. Some single-celled
organisms also release molecules to signal to each other.
Signaling in Yeast
Yeasts are eukaryotes (fungi), and the components and processes found in yeast signals are similar to those of cell-surface
receptor signals in multicellular organisms. Budding yeasts (Figure 9.16) are able to participate in a process that is similar
to sexual reproduction that entails two haploid cells (cells with one-half the normal number of chromosomes) combining
to form a diploid cell (a cell with two sets of each chromosome, which is what normal body cells contain). In order to find
another haploid yeast cell that is prepared to mate, budding yeasts secrete a signaling molecule called mating factor. When
mating factor binds to cell-surface recep
