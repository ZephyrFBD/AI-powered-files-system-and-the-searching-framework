Acetic acid can also be produced by the reaction of methanol with carbon monoxide 
in the presence of a rhodium catalyst:

This reaction is not an oxidation; it involves, in effect, the insertion of a carbon monoxide 
molecule between the CH3 and OH groups. A reaction of this kind is called carbonylation.
Carboxylic acids can undergo condensation reactions with alcohols to form esters:

Esters are compounds in which the H atom of a carboxylic acid is replaced by a carbon- 
containing group:

Give It Some Thought
What is the difference between an ether and an ester?
The name of any ester consists of the name of the group contributed by the alco-
hol followed by the name of the group contributed by the carboxylic acid, with the -ic 
replaced by -ate. For example, the ester formed from ethyl alcohol, CH3CH2OH, and 
butyric acid, CH31CH
