. The statement in choice A is not correct because chemical
messages readily flow from one plant cell to another through
plasmodesmata. The statement in choice C is not correct because
estrogen is hydrophobic, dissolves through the plasma membrane,
and binds with receptors inside the cell. It is hydrophilic ligands that
require a secondary messenger, like cyclic AMP. The statement in
choice D is not correct, because the first thing that happens in a
receiving cell is reception, not transduction. (ENE-2 & IST-3)
(B) If you add up the total solute on each side, you will see that there
is more solute on side B. Therefore, water will tend to flow to side
B. There is a higher concentration of glucose on side A, so glucose
would not diffuse from side B to side A, making choice A incorrect.
Choice C is not correct because there is lots of differential
movement in both directions. Choice D is not correct because the
information given in the question states that the membrane is not
permeable to
