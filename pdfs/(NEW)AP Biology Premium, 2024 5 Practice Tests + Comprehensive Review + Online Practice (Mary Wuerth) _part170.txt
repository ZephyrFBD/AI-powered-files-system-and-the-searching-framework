proceed over it. The higher the activation energy, the slower the chemical reaction.
All chemical reactions require an input of energy to reach a transition state to get the reaction started. The
activation energy (EA) is the difference between the energy level of the reactants and the transition state of the
reaction. (See Figure 7.3.) Higher activation energies result in slower chemical reactions; lower activation energies
allow chemical reactions to proceed at a faster rate. The enzymes speed up chemical reactions by lowering the
activation energy of the reaction.
Enzymes can lower the activation energy of a reaction in a number of ways:
1. Bringing substrates together in the proper orientation for a reaction to occur
2. Destabilizing chemical bonds in the substrate by bending the substrate
3. Forming temporary ionic or covalent bonds with the substrate
While enzymes can lower the activation energy of reactions, enzymes cannot change an endergonic reaction into
an exer
