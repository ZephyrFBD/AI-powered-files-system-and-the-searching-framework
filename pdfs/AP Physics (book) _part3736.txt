rly no Big Bang. To maintain this view in the face of the
recession of galaxies away from each other, matter would need to be created
continuously to maintain the assumption of uniformity. The rate of mass creation
required is very small—about one nucleon per cubic meter every 
The steady-state model provided the Big Bang model with healthy competi-
tion in the mid-twentieth century. But the discovery of the cosmic microwave
background radiation (next Section), as well as other observations of the universe,
has made the Big Bang model universally accepted.

Microwave Background
The expansion of the universe suggests that typical objects in the universe were
once much closer together than they are now. This is the basis for the idea that
the universe began about 14 billion years ago as an expansion from a state of very
high density and temperature known affectionately as the Big Bang.
The birth of the universe was not an explosion, because an explosion bl
