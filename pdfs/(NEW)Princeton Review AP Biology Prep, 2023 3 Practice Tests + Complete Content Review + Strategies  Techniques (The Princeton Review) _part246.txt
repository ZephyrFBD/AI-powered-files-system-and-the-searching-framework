Each carrier molecule hands down the electrons to the next molecule in the chain. The electrons travel down the
electron transport chain until they reach the final electron acceptor, oxygen. Oxygen combines with these electrons
(and some hydrogens) to form water. This explains the “aerobic” in aerobic respiration. If oxygen weren’t available
to accept the electrons, they wouldn’t move down the chain at all, thereby shutting down the whole process of
electron transport.
NADP+ is the terminal electron acceptor in photosynthesis, while oxygen is the
terminal electron acceptor in cellular respiration.
Chemiosmosis
At the same time that electrons are being passed down the electron transport chain, another mechanism is at work.
Remember those hydrogen ions (also called protons) that split off from the original hydrogen atom? The energy
released from the electron transport chain is used to pump hydrogen ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane
from the matrix into the intermembrane spa
