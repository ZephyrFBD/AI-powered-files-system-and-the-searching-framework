 overview of photosynthesis.
You’ll notice from this equation that carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials used to manufacture simple
sugars. You’ll also see that oxygen is one of the products of photosynthesis. One important concept to know for the
AP Exam is that there is strong evidence that prokaryotic photosynthesis contributed to the production of oxygen in
the atmosphere. Furthermore, prokaryotic photosynthesis pathways laid the evolutionary foundation for eukaryotic
photosynthesis to develop. But remember, there’s much more to photosynthesis than what’s shown in the simple
reaction above.
There are two stages in photosynthesis: the light reactions (also called the light-dependent reactions) and the dark
reactions (also called the light-independent reactions). The whole process begins when photons (energy units) of
sunlight strike a leaf, activating chlorophyll and exciting electrons. The activated chlorophyll molecule then passes
these excited electrons down to a series
