hey will revisit the concept when 
exploring transpiration in plants. 
■ Where Can Students Go from Here? 
Ask students if they think that fungal cells have turgor pressure. Then ask them to design 
an experiment to test their hypothesis.

Taiz, Lincoln and Eduardo Zeiger. 2010. Unit One: Transport and Translocation of 
Water and Solutes in Plant Physiology, 5th ed., pp. 67–159. Sinauer Associates, Inc., 
Sunderland, MA. 
The unit covers water and cells, water balance in plants, and solute transport. The book 
is an excellent reference on plant physiology.

The Molecular Workbench and Lab Bench laboratory online resources about diffusion 
and osmosis are excellent prelaboratory resources. Both provide feedback with hints 
when students answer the quest
