 reaction
step is facilitated, or catalyzed, by a protein called an enzyme. Enzymes are important for catalyzing all types of biological
reactions—those that require energy as well as those that release energy.
Figure 6.5 Anabolic pathways are those that require energy to synthesize larger molecules. Catabolic pathways are
those that generate energy by breaking down larger molecules. Both types of pathways are required for maintaining
the cell’s energy balance.
Think About It
Describe two different cellular functions in different organisms that require energy that parallel human energy-
requiring functions such as physical exercise.
Section Summary
Cells perform the functions of life through various chemical reactions. A cell’s metabolism refers to the chemical reactions
that take place within it. There are metabolic reactions that involve the breaking down of complex chemicals into simpler
ones, such as the breakdown of large macromolecules. This process is referred to as catabolism,
