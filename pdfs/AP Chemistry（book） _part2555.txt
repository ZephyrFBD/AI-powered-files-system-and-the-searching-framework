Sample Exercise 16.10 
Calculating Ka from Measured pH
Plan Although we are dealing specifically with the ionization of a 
weak acid, this problem is similar to the equilibrium problems in 
Chapter 15. We can solve this problem using the method outlined 
in Sample Exercise 15.8, starting with the chemical reaction and a 
tabulation of initial and equilibrium concentrations.
The equilibrium-constant expression is:
Ka =
3H+43HCOO-4
3HCOOH4
From the measured pH, we can calculate 3H+4:
To determine the concentrations of the species 
involved in the equilibrium, we consider that the 
solution is initially 0.10 M in HCOOH molecules. 
We then consider the ionization of the acid into 
H+ and HCOO-. For each HCOOH molecule that 
ionizes, one H+ ion and one HCOO- ion are pro-
duced in solution. Because the pH measurement 
indicates that 3H+4 = 4.2 * 10-3 M at equilib-
rium, we can construct the following table:
HCOOH1aq2   ∆   H+1aq2   +    HCOO-1aq2
Initial  
concentration (M)
