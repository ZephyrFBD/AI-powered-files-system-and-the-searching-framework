mpresses (note that here work is done by both 
the spring and gravity).
77. (a) A 3.0-g locust reaches a speed of 
during its
jump. What is its kinetic energy at this speed? (b) If the
locust transforms energy with 35% efficiency, how much
energy is required for the jump?
3.0 ms
Ak = 8.00 * 104 NmB
73. A 36.0-kg crate, starting from rest, is pulled across a floor
with a constant horizontal force of 225 N. For the first
11.0 m the floor is frictionless, and for the next 10.0 m the
coefficient of friction is 0.20. What is the final speed of 
the crate after being pulled these 21.0 m?
74. How high will a 1.85-kg rock go from the point of release if
thrown straight up by someone who does 80.0 J of work on
it? Neglect air resistance.
91. An 18-kg sled starts up a 28Â° incline with a speed of
The coefficient of kinetic friction is
(a) How far up the incline does the sled travel? (b) What
condition must you put on the coefficient of static friction
if the sled is not to get stuck at the poin
