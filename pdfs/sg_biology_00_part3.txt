Question 1 Scoring Guide
Each bullet is worth one point:
Part a. (maximum 6 points)
• Optimum temperature and pH concept [must include both temp and pH]
• Enzyme/Substrate Fit concept
 
(function dependent  on conformation complementarity between enzyme and substrate)
• Tertiary (and sometimes  quarternary) structure  determines function
• Description of enzyme structure or function, e.g.
Structure
Function
Elegant description of primary to tertiary or primary to
quarternary levels of structure
Increases rate of reaction
Protein folding/coiling
Increases proximity of reactants
Co-enzymes/co-factors
Decreases activation energy of the catalyzed reaction
Zymogens
Decreases time to reach equilibrium
Allosteric effectors
Induced fit and/or orbital s
