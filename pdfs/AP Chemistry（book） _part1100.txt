dic Properties of the Elements
The irregularities in a given period are subtle but still readily explained. For exam-
ple, the decrease in ionization energy from beryllium 13He42s22 to boron 13He42s22p12, 
shown in Figure 7.10, occurs because the third valence electron of B must occupy the 2p 
subshell, which is empty for Be. Recall that the 2p subshell is at a higher energy than 
the 2s subshell (Figure 6.25). The slight decrease in ionization energy when moving from 
nitrogen 13He42s22p32 to oxygen 13He42s22p42 is the result of the repulsion of paired 
electrons in the p4 configuration (Figure 7.11). Remember that according to Hund’s rule, 
each electron in the p3 configuration resides in a different p orbital, which minimizes the 
 
electron–electron repulsion among the three 2p electrons.

Electron Configurations of Ions
When electrons are removed from an atom to form a cation, they are always removed first 
from the occupied orbitals having the largest principal qua
