ion of CO to CO2 
is -283.0 kJ>mol CO:
(1)   C1s2 + O21g2 ¡  CO21g2   ∆H = -393.5 kJ
(2) CO1g2 + 1
2 O21g2 ¡  CO21g2   ∆H = -283.0 kJ
Using these data, calculate the enthalpy for the combustion of C to CO:
(3)  C1s2 + 1
2 O21g2 ¡  CO1g2    ∆H = ?

Hess’s Law

 SOLUTION
Analyze We are given two thermochemical equations, and our goal 
is to combine them in such a way as to obtain the third equation 
and its enthalpy change.
Plan We will use Hess’s law. In doing so, we first note the number of 
moles of substances among the reactants and products in the target 
equation (3). We then manipulate equations (1) and (2) to give the 
same number of moles of these substances, so that when the result-
ing equations are added, we obtain the target equation. At the same 
time, we keep track of the enthalpy changes, which we add.
Solve To use equations (1) and (2), we arrange them so that C(s) is 
on the reactant side and CO(g) is on the product side of the arrow, 
as in the targ
