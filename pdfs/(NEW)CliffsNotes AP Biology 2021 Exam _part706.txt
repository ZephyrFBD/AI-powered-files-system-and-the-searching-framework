 and plants decompose.
2. Carbon cycle. Carbon is required for the building of all organic compounds.
 Reservoirs: Atmosphere (as CO2), bodies of water (as
 
bicarbonate), fossil fuels (coal, oil), peat, durable organic material (cellulose, for example).
 Assimilation: Plants use CO2 in photosynthesis; animals
 
consume plants or other animals.
 Release: Plants and animals release CO2 through respiration and decomposition; CO2 is released when organic
material (such as
 
wood and fossil fuels) is burned.
 
3. Nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen is required for the manufacture of all amino acids and nucleic acids.
 
Reservoirs: Atmosphere (N2); soil (NH4+ or ammonium, NH3 or ammonia, NO2− or nitrite, NO3− or nitrate).
Assimilation: Plants absorb nitrogen either as NO3− or as NH4+;
animals obtain nitrogen by eating plants or other animals. The stages in the assimilation of nitrogen are as follows:
 
• Nitrogen fixation: N2 to NH4+ by nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes (in soil and root nodules); N2 to NO3
