 they survived. In another
experiment, when he injected mice with the heat-killed S strain, they also survived. In a third set of experiments, a mixture
of live R strain and heat-killed S strain were injected into mice, and—to his surprise—the mice died. Upon isolating the live
bacteria from the dead mouse, only the S strain of bacteria was recovered. When this isolated S strain was injected into fresh
mice, the mice died. Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain into the live R strain and
transformed it into the pathogenic S strain, and he called this the transforming principle (Figure 14.3). These experiments
are now famously known as Griffith's transformation experiments.

pathogenic. The S strain is pathogenic and c
