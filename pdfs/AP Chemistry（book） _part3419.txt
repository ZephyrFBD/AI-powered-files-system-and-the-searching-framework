ressurized water reac-
tors, there are several variations on this basic design, each with advantages and disad-
vantages. A boiling water reactor generates steam by boiling the primary coolant; thus, 
no secondary coolant is needed. The reactors at Fukushima, Japan, were boiling water 
reactors. Pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors are collectively referred to 
as light water reactors because they use H2O as moderator and primary coolant. A heavy 
water reactor uses D2O (D = deuterium, 
2H2 as moderator and primary coolant, and a 
gas-cooled reactor uses a gas, typically CO2, as primary coolant and graphite as the mod-
erator. Use of either D2O or graphite as the moderator has the advantage that both sub-
stances absorb fewer neutrons than H2O. Consequently, the uranium fuel does not need 
to be as enriched.
Nuclear Waste
The fission products that accumulate as a reactor operates decrease the efficiency of the 
reactor by capturing neutrons. For this reason, commercial
