 kidney and urinary systems of vertebrate
animals. The simplest system is that of contractile vacuoles present in microorganisms. Flame cells and nephridia in
worms perform excretory functions and maintain osmotic balance. Some insects have evolved Malpighian tubules to
excrete wastes and maintain osmotic balance.
32.4 Nitrogenous Wastes
Ammonia is the waste produced by metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds like proteins and nucleic acids. While
aquatic animals can easily excrete ammonia into their watery surroundings, terrestrial animals have evolved special
mechanisms to eliminate the toxic ammonia from their systems. Urea is the major byproduct of ammonia metabolism in
vertebrate animals. Uric acid is the major byproduct of ammonia metabolism in birds, terrestrial arthropods, and reptiles.
32.5 Hormonal Control of Osmoregulatory Functions
Hormonal cues help the kidneys synchronize the osmotic needs of the body. Hormones like epinephrine, norepinephrine,
renin-angiotensin, aldo
