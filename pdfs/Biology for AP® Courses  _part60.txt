t has evolved to specialize in infection in
humans is Plasmodium, the organism that causes malaria. Biologists use the process of science to learn about the world and
the organisms living in it. For example, people have suspected for quite some time that people with blood type O are less
likely to die from severe malaria. Now, a team of scientists have been able to explain why. By examining data from several
experiments, and by using both inductive and deductive reasoning, the scientists concluded that A and B type blood reacts
with a protein excreted by Plasmodium. This reaction causes severe illness. However, type O blood does not react with
the protein. You can read more (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32plasmodium) about the response of type A and B blood
groups to infection by Plasmodium.
