f-life, which should occur at 
680 s, the concentration should have decreased by yet another 
factor of 2, to 0.025 M. Inspection of the graph shows that this is 
indeed the case.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
We noted in an earlier Practice Exercise that at 25 °C the 
decomposition of N2O51g2 into NO21g2 and O21g2 follows 
first-order kinetics with k = 3.4 * 10-5 s-1. How long will 
it take for a sample originally containing 2.0 atm of N2O5 to 
reach a partial pressure of 380 torr?
(a) 5.7 h (b) 8.2 h (c) 11 h (d) 16 h (e) 32 h
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
(a) Using Equation 14.17, calculate t1>2 for the decomposition 
of the insecticide described in Sample Exercise 14.7.
(b) How long does it take for the concentration of the insecti-
cide to reach one-quarter of the initial value?

The half-life for second-order and other reactions depends on reactant concentra-
tions and therefore changes as the reaction progresses. We obtained Equation 14.17 for 
the h
