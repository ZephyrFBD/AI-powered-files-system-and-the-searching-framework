▶Practice Exercise 2
Using Figure 14.3, determine the instantaneous rate of disap-
pearance of C4H9Cl at t = 300 s.
Give It Some Thought
In Figure 14.3, order the following three rates from fastest to slowest: (i) The average 
rate of the reaction between 0 s and 600 s, (ii) the instantaneous rate at t = 0 s, and 
(iii) the instantaneous rate at t = 600 s. You should not have to do any calculations.

14.3 ∣ Concentration and Rate Laws
One way of studying the effect of concentration on reaction rate is to determine the way 
in which the initial rate of a reaction depends on the initial concentrations. For example, 
we might study the rate of the reaction
 
NH4
+1aq2 + NO2  
-1aq2 ¡ N21g2 + 2 H2O1l2 
by measuring the concentration of NH4
+ or NO2
-  as a function of time or by measuring 
the volume of N2 collected as a function of time. Because the stoichiometric coefficients 
on NH4
+, NO2
-, and N2 are the same, all
