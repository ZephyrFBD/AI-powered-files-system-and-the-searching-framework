her liquid) and from which the
air has been removed (Fig.13–24). The fastest moving molecules quickly evaporate
into the empty space above the liquid’s surface. As they move about, some of these
molecules strike the liquid surface and again become part of the liquid phase: this
is called condensation. The number of molecules in the vapor increases until 
the number of molecules returning to the liquid equals the number leaving in the
same time interval. Equilibrium then exists, and the space above the liquid surface is
said to be saturated. The pressure of the vapor when it is saturated is called the
saturated vapor pressure (or simply the vapor pressure).
The saturated vapor pressure of any substance depends on the temperature.
At higher temperatures, more molecules have sufficient kinetic energy to break
from the liquid surface into the vapor phase. Hence equilibrium will be reached
at a higher vapor pressure. The saturated vapor pressure of water at various tempera-
tures is given i
