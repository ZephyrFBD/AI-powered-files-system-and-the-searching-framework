ver, cells from all organisms—even organisms as diverse
as bacteria, onion, and human—share certain fundamental characteristics.
In humans, before a cell develops into its specialized type, it is called a stem cell. A stem cell is a cell that has not undergone
the changes involved in specialization. In this state, it may differentiate to become one of many different specialized cells,
and it may divide to produce more stem cells. Under normal circumstances, once a cell becomes specialized, it remains that
way. However, scientists have been working on coaxing stem cells in the laboratory to become a particular specialization.
For example, scientists at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center have learned how to use stem cells to grow
stomach tissue in plastic cell and tissue culture dishes. This accomplishment will enable researchers to study gastric human
diseases, such as stomach cancer. You can read more about it here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32cellsize) .
