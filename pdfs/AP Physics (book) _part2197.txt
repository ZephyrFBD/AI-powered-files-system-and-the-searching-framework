The force is greatest when the

The force is zero if the particle moves parallel to the field lines 
The
direction of the force is perpendicular to the magnetic field 
and to the velocity 
of the particle. For a positive charge, the force direction is given by another 
right-hand rule: you orient your right hand so that your outstretched fingers
point along the direction of the particle’s velocity 
and when you bend your
fingers they must point along the direction of 
Then your thumb will point in
the direction of the force. This is true only for positively charged particles, and
will be “up” for the positive particle shown in Fig. 20–15. For negatively charged
particles, the force is in exactly the opposite direction, “down” in Fig. 20–15.
