entists still do not fully understand the biochemical action of lithium 
that leads to its therapeutic effects. Because of its similarity to Na+, Li+ 
is incorporated into blood plasma, where it can affect the behavior 
of nerve and muscle cells. Because Li+ has a smaller radius than Na+ 
(Figure 7.8), the way Li+ interacts with molecules in human cells is 
different from the way Na+ interacts with the molecules. Other stud-
ies indicate that Li+ alters the function of certain neurotransmitters, 
which might lead to its effectiveness as an antipsychotic drug.

contained a lithium salt that was claimed to give the beverage 
healthful benefits, including “an abundance of energy, enthusiasm, 
a clear complexion, lustrous hair, and shining eyes!” The lithium was 
removed from the beverage in the early 1950s, about the time that the 
antipsychotic action of Li+ was discovered.
