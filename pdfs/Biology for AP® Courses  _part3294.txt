the phylogenetic relationships among these groups.
Annotate your representation to show gene additions and
deletions. To your representation also add annotation that
connects the phenotype to the environment.
58. When you get cold you may shiver. The shivering
response is a reflex in which the hypothalamus in the brain
integrates sensory input, comparing input against a
temperature set point. When a threshold signal is detected,
nerves of the somatic nervous system that innervate
skeletal muscle are stimulated. The extension and
contraction of muscle cells releases heat energy that
elevates the body temperature.
A. Construct a representation of the information flow
for the shivering response. Annotate your representation to
include
•
the sensory input
•
signal transmission to the hypothalamus
•
signal transmission from the hypothalamus to the
somatic nervous system
•
transmission to muscle tissue
•
and output response.
Include in your annotation the negative feedback loop that
is estab
