ter all the lactose has been digested, the repressor can again bind to the operator
sequence, shutting down the operon. This type of feedback mechanism allows the cell to manufacture the proteins
needed to digest lactose only when they are needed, saving valuable resources in the cell.
Figure 17.2 Lac Operon
While the binding of repressor proteins to the operator sequence can negatively regulate gene expression, there
are also ways to positively “upregulate” gene expression. An example of this is the interaction between cyclic AMP
(cAMP) and the catabolite activator protein (CAP) in the lac operon. When glucose levels are low, cAMP levels in
the cell increase. cAMP binds to the catabolite activator protein (CAP), stimulating CAP to bind at a CAP binding
site near the promoter. This increases the affinity of RNA polymerase for the promoter, stimulating transcription. So
transcription of the lac operon is increased when glucose, another food source for the bacteria, is absent, allowing
