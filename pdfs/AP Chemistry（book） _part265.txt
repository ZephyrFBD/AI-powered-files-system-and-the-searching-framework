drops downward but is

that pushes the negatively 
charged drops upward.
▲ Figure 2.5 Millikan’s oil-drop experiment to measure the charge of the electron. Small drops  
of oil are allowed to fall between electrically charged plates. Millikan measured how varying the  
voltage between the plates affected the rate of fall. From these data he calculated the negative  
charge on the drops. Because the charge on any drop was always some integral multiple of  
1.602 * 10-19 C, Millikan deduced this value to be the charge of a single electron.

(1867–1934). In 1903, Henri Becquerel, 
Marie Curie, and her husband, Pierre, were 
jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 
for their pioneering work on radioactivity 
(a term she introduced). In 1911, Marie 
Curie won a second Nobel Prize, this time in 
chemistry for her discovery of the elements
