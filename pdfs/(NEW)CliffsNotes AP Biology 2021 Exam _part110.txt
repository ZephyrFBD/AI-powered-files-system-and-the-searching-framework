and solvents cannot penetrate. Many of the proteins
in the membrane serve to facilitate the movement of these materials across the membrane, either by passive
diffusion (channel proteins, ion channels, carrier proteins) or by active transport.
4. A. When there is a concentration gradient, water will move across a membrane unassisted by ATP or channel
proteins. In contrast, solutes (the dissolved substances) cannot cross the membrane unassisted.
5. C. Microtubules originate from basal bodies or centrioles (microtubule organizing centers, or MTOCs), not from
the plasma membrane.
6. D. Fats usually originate from smooth ER; proteins originate from ribosomes or rough ER; choice C would be
appropriate for mitochondria.
7. C. Since mitochondria produce ATP (but not with the aid of sunlight, as stated in choice B), they are often found
near areas of major cellular activity, areas that require large amounts of energy.
8. D. Note that this question asks about solutes moving down a concentration
