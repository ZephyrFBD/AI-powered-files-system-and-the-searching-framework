We can usually make qualitative predictions about entropy changes by focusing on 
these factors. For example, when water vaporizes, the molecules spread out into a larger vol-
ume. Because they occupy a larger volume, there is an increase in their freedom of motion, 
giving rise to a greater number of possible microstates, and hence an increase in entropy.
Now consider the phases of water. In ice, hydrogen bonding leads to the rigid 
structure shown in Figure 19.9. Each molecule in the ice is free to vibrate, but its transla-
tional and rotational motions are much more restricted than in liquid water. Although 
there are hydrogen bonds in liquid water, the molecules can more readily move about 
relative to one another (translation) and tumble around (rotation). During melting, 
therefore, the number of possible microstates increases, and so does the entropy. In 
water vapor, the molecules are essentially independent of one another and have their
