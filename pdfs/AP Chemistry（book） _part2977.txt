 in the temperature of ocean water. The oceans 
serve as a “sink” for CO2 by dissolving large amounts of it. 
(a) The figure below shows the solubility of CO2 in water as 
a function of temperature. Does CO2 behave more or less 
similarly to other gases in this respect?
 
 (b) What are the implications of this figure for the problem 
of climate change?
 18.72  The rate of solar energy striking Earth averages 168 watts 
per square meter. The rate of energy radiated from Earth’s 
surface averages 390 watts per square meter. Comparing 
these numbers, one might expect that the planet would 
cool quickly, yet it does not. Why not?
 18.73  The solar power striking Earth every day averages 168 
watts per square meter. The highest ever recorded electrical 
power usage in New York City was 13,200 MW.  A record 
established in July of 2013. Considering that present tech-
nology for solar energy conversion is about 10% efficient, 
from how many square meters of land must sunlight be 
collected in
