d by B cells.
63. B. When B cells encounter an antigen, they divide, and produce two kinds of daughter B cells—plasma cells and
memory cells. Plasma cells release antibodies immediately, but memory cells circulate in the blood for years. When
an antigen is introduced into the body a second time, antibodies from the memory cells respond to the antigens
immediately.

1. Answer: 5.8 (acceptable range: 5.7-5.8)
 
First, find the expected number of each kind of seed by making a Punnett square of the cross Yy × yy:
 
The cross yields ½ Yy and ½ yy. For the 100 seeds that
were observed,
 
then, the expected numbers for the two F1 phenotypes are 50 and 50. Calculations for determining χ2 are shown in
the following table:
 
Completing the calculation:
 
Although not requested in this question, you should also know that the degrees of freedom
(df) is the number of observed phenotypic
 
categories minus 1, or 2 − 1 = 1. Also, the critical value for χ2 (for df =
1), found on the e
