EXAMPLE 6;1
In Example 6–1 we saw that friction did negative work. In general, the work
done by a force is negative whenever the force (or the component of the force,
)
acts in the direction opposite to the direction of motion.

EXERCISE A A box is dragged a distance d across a floor by a force 
which makes an
angle 
with the horizontal as in Fig. 6–1 or 6–3. If the magnitude of 
is held constant 
but the angle 
is increased, the work done by 
(a) remains the same; (b) increases;
(c) decreases; (d) first increases, then de
