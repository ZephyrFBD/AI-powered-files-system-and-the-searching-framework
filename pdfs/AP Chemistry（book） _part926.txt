no greater than the wavelength of the  
radiation used. Thus, if we 
want an accurate position measurement for an electron, we must 
use a short wavelength. This means that photons of high energy 
must be employed. The more energy the photons have, the more 
 
momentum they impart to the electron when they strike it, which 
changes the electron’s motion in an unpredictable way. The 
attempt to measure accurately the electron’s position introduces 
considerable  
uncertainty in its momentum; the act of measuring 
the electron’s position at one moment makes our knowledge of its 
future position inaccurate.
Suppose, then, that we use photons of longer wavelength. 
Because these photons have lower energy, the momentum of 
the electron is not so appreciably changed during measurement, 
but at the same time the longer wavelength limits the accuracy 
with
