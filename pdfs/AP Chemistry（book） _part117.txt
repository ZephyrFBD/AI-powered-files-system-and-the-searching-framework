elves thinking in two realms: the macroscopic realm of ordinary-sized objects 
1macro = large2 and the submicroscopic realm of atoms and molecules. We make our 
observations in the macroscopic world, but to understand that world, we must visu-
alize how atoms and molecules behave at the submicroscopic level. Chemistry is the 
science that seeks to understand the properties and behavior of matter by studying 
the properties and behavior of atoms and molecules.
Give It Some Thought
(a) Approximately how many elements are there?
(b) What submicroscopic particles are the building blocks of matter?
Why Study Chemistry?
Chemistry lies near the heart of many matters of public concern, such as improvement 
of health care, conservation of natural resources, protection of the environment, and 
the supply of energy needed to keep society running. Using chemistry, we have discov-
ered and continually improved upon pharmaceuticals, fertilizers and pesticides, plas-
tics, solar panels, light-emittin
