eds to be neutralized. We need to neutralize at least that 
much acid, although there may be a great deal more than that 
amount in the lake.
The oxide ion of CaO is very basic. 
 (Section 16.5) In 
the neutralization reaction, 1 mol of CaO reacts with 2 mol 
of H+ to form H2O and Ca2+ ions. Thus, 4 * 104 mol of H+ 
requires
14 * 104 mol H+2a 1 mol CaO
2 mol H+ b a
56.1 g CaO
1 mol CaO b = 1 * 106 g CaO
This is slightly more than a ton of CaO. That would not be 
very costly because CaO is inexpensive, selling for less than 
$100 per ton when purchased in large quantities. This amount 
of CaO is the minimum amount needed, however, because 
there are likely to be weak acids in the water that must also be 
neutralized.
This liming procedure has been used to bring the pH of 
some small lakes into the range necessary for Ô¨Åsh to live. The 
lake in our example would be about a half mile long and a half 
mile wide and have an average depth of 20 ft.
