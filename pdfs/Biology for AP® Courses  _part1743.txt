t, have intracellular organelles that add to their complexity. In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is
contained inside the cellâ€™s nucleus and there it is transcribed into RNA. The newly synthesized RNA is then transported
out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate the RNA into protein. The processes of transcription and
translation are physically separated by the nuclear membrane; transcription occurs only within the nucleus, and translation
occurs only outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process
(Figure 16.2). Regulation may occur when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription
factors ( epigenetic level), when the RNA is transcribed (transcriptional level), when the RNA is processed and exported
to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed ( post-transcriptional level), when the RNA is translated into protein (translational
level), or after the protein has been made ( post-trans
