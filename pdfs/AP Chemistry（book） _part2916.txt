stes, include sew-
age, industrial wastes from food-processing plants and paper mills, and liquid waste from 
meatpacking plants.
In the presence of oxygen, the carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phospho-
rus in biodegradable material end up mainly as CO2, HCO3
-, H2O, NO3
-, SO4
2-, and 
phosphates. The formation of these oxidation products sometimes reduces the amount 
of dissolved oxygen to the point where aerobic bacteria can no longer survive. Anaer-
obic bacteria then take over the decomposition process, forming CH4, NH3, H2S, PH3, 
and other products, several of which contribute to the offensive odors of some polluted 
waters.
Plant nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, contribute to water pollu-
tion by stimulating excessive growth of aquatic plants. The most visible results of exces-
sive plant growth are floating algae and murky water. What is more significant, however, 
is that as plant growth becomes excessive, the amount of dead and decaying plant mat-
