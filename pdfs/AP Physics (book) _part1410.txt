 of a gas, partly because
the expansion can be so great, and partly because gases generally expand to fill
whatever container they are in. Indeed, Eq. 13–2 is meaningful only if the pres-
sure is kept constant. The volume of a gas depends very much on the pressure as
well as on the temperature. It is therefore valuable to determine a relation
between the volume, the pressure, the temperature, and the quantity of a gas. Such
a relation is called an equation of state. (By the word state, we mean the physical
condition of the system.)
If the state of a system is changed, we will always wait until the pressure and
temperature have reached the same values throughout. We thus consider only
equilibrium states of a system—when the variables that describe it (such as tem-
perature and pressure) are the same throughout the system and are not changing in
time. We also note that the results of this Section are accurate only for gases that
are not too dense (the pressure is not too high, on the ord
