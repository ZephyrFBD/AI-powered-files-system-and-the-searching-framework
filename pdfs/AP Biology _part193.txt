Living things require a constant input of energy.
Figure 6.1 The ATP Cycle
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, whereas ATP can be created or destroyed.
Energy can be transferred.
There are two types of cell respiration: anaerobic and aerobic. If oxygen is
not present (anaerobic respiration), glycolysis is followed by either
alcoholic fermentation or lactic acid fermentation. If oxygen is present
(aerobic respiration), glycolysis is only the first phase of aerobic
respiration. It is followed by the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), the
electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation.
Reduction is the gain of electrons (e–) or hydrogen (H+), while
oxidation is the loss of electrons or protons. In the equation showing
cellular respiration (see page 103), we see that glucose is oxidized because
it loses protons and electrons to oxygen. In the same reaction, oxygen is
reduced because it gains protons and electrons from
