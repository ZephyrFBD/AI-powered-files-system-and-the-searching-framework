†The term “electromotive force” is a misnomer—it does not refer to a “force” that is measured in 
newtons. To avoid confusion, we use the abbreviation, emf.

FIGURE 19–2 Example 19–1.
Battery with internal resistance. A 
resistor is
connected to the terminals of a battery whose emf is 12.0 V and whose internal
resistance is 
Fig. 19–2. Calculate (a) the current in the circuit, (b) the
terminal voltage of the battery,
and (c) the power dissipated in the resistor R
and in the battery’s internal resistance r.
APPROACH We first consider the battery as a whole, which is shown in Fig.19–2
as an emf 
and internal resistance r between points a and b. Then we apply
to the circuit itself.
