13.1 ∣ The Solution Process
A solution is formed when one substance disperses uniformly throughout another. The abil-
ity of substances to form solutions depends on two factors: (1) the natural tendency of 
substances to mix and spread into larger volumes when not restrained in some way and 
 
(2) the types of intermolecular interactions involved in the solution process.
The Natural Tendency toward Mixing
Suppose we have O21g2 and Ar(g) separated by a barrier, as in Figure 13.1. If the barrier is 
removed, the gases mix to form a solution. The molecules experience very little intermo-
lecular interactions and behave like ideal gas particles. As a result, their molecular motion 
causes them to spread through the larger volume, and a gaseous solution is formed.
The mixing of gases is a spontaneous process, meaning it occurs of its own accord 
without any input of energy from ou
