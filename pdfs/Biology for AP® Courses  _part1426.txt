d.
Recombination of the gray/black body color and long/short aristae alleles will not occur.
As shown in Figure 13.4, by using recombination frequency to predict genetic distance, the relative order of genes on
chromosome 2 could be inferred. The values shown represent map distances in centimorgans (cM), which correspond to
recombination frequencies (in percent). Therefore, the genes for body color and wing size were 65.5 âˆ’48.5 = 17 cM apart,
indicating that the maternal and paternal alleles for these genes recombine in 17 percent of offspring, on average.
To construct a chromosome map, Sturtevant assumed that genes were ordered serially on threadlike chromosomes. He also
assumed that the incidence of recombination between two homologous chromosomes could occur with equal likelihood
anywhere along the length of the chromosome. Operating under these assumptions, Sturtevant postulated that alleles
that were far
