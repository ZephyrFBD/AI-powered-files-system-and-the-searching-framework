from the same human body were exposed to a chemical that
disrupted their plasma membranes. The samples were then
sequentially spun in an ultracentrifuge to isolate layers of subcellular
components. Below is a histogram that shows the results of this
experiment:
Describe the key differences between Cell Type A and Cell
Type B, based on this histogram. (1 point)
Describe how these data suggest different functions for Cell
Type A and Cell Type B. (1 point)
