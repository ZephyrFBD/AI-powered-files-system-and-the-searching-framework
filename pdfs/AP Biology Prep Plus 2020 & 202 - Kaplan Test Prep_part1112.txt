46. Gap junctions are formed between two adjacent cells by joining two
hemichannels or connexons, one in each cell’s plasma membrane. The
colonization of pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium, on the apical surface
(which faces the lumen of the colon) of mice intestinal cells causes
diarrheal disease (liquid stools). Researchers observed that connexon
protein levels increased during infection.
Based on the information given, which of the following is a plausible
explanation for the mechanism by which Citrobacter rodentium causes
diarrheal disease?
Facilitated diﬀusion of small molecules and ions against their
concentration gradient causes transport of water into the lumen via
open unpaired hemichannels.

Functionally open unpaired hemichannels of infected cells allow
