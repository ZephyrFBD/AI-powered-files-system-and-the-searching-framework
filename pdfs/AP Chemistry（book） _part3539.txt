lfide 1S2 -2 and sulfate 1SO4
2 -2 minerals. Its presence as a minor component 
of coal and petroleum poses a major problem. Combustion of these “unclean” fuels leads 
to serious pollution by sulfur oxides. 
 (Section 18.2) Much effort has been directed at 
removing this sulfur, and these efforts have increased the availability of sulfur.
Selenium and tellurium occur in rare minerals, such as Cu2Se, PbSe, Cu2Te, and 
PbTe, and as minor constituents in sulfide ores of copper, iron, nickel, and lead.
Properties and Uses of Sulfur, Selenium, and Tellurium
Elemental sulfur is yellow, tasteless, and nearly odorless. It is insoluble in water and exists 
in several allotropic forms. The thermodynamically stable form at room temperature is 
rhombic sulfur, which consists of puckered S8 rings with each sulfur atom forming two 
bonds (Figure 7.27).
Most of the sulfur produced in the United States each year is used to manufacture 
sulfuric acid. Sulfur is also used to vulcanize rubber, a process
