orption refers to the binding of molecules to a surface, whereas absorption refers 
to the uptake of molecules into the interior of a substance. 
 (Section 13.6) Adsorp-
tion occurs because the atoms or ions at the surface of a solid are extremely reactive. 
Because the catalyzed reaction occurs on the surface, special methods are often used 
to prepare catalysts so that they have very large surface areas. Unlike their counter-
parts in the interior of the substance, surface atoms and ions have unused bonding 
capacity that can be used to bond molecules from the gas or solution phase to the 
surface of the solid.
The reaction of hydrogen gas with ethylene gas to form ethane gas provides an 
example of heterogeneous catalysis:
 
C2H41g2 + H21g2 ¡ C2H61g2  ∆H° = -137 kJ>mol 
[14.34]
Even though this reaction is exothermic, it occurs very slowly in the absence of 
a catalyst. In the presence of a finely powdered metal, however, such as nickel, 
palladium, or platinum, the reaction occurs
