ced due to a  7 TeV proton–proton
collision at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is a candidate for having produced the long-
sought Higgs boson (plus other particles). The
Higgs in this case could have decayed (very
quickly 
) into two Z bosons (which are
carriers of the weak force):
We don’t see the tracks of the 
particles
because (1) they are neutral and (2) they decay
too quickly (
), in this case:
The tracks of the 2 electrons and 2 positrons are
shown as green lines. The Higgs is thought to
play a fundamental role in the Standard Model
of particle physics, importantly providing mass
to fundamental particles.
The CMS detector of this photo uses a
combination of the detector types discussed in
Section 30–13. A magnetic field causes particles
to move in curved paths so the momentum of
each can be measured (Section 20–4). Tracks of
particles with very large momentum, such as our
electrons here, are barely curved.
In this Chapter we will study elementary
particle physics from its b
