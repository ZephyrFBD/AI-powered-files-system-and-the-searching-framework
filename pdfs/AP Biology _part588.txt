apter supported Big Ideas: EVO and SYI.
Behavior enables an individual to do all the things it needs to do to be
successful: stay alive and pass on its genes to the next generation. Animal
behaviors evolved under strong evolutionary pressures.
When you look at a particular behavior, analyze it in two ways:
1. What systems are responsible for that behavior (proximate causes)?
Is the behavior genetic or is it learned?
2. How does the behavior make the animal more fit? How or why did
that behavior evolve? What are the ultimate causes for that behavior?
