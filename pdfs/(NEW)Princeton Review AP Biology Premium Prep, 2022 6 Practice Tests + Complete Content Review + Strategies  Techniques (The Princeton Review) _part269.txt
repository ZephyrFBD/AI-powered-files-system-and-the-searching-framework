hromatids are held together by a structure called the
centromere. You can think of each chromatid as a chromosome, but because they remain attached, they are called
chromatids instead. To be called a chromosome, each needs to have its own centromere. Once the chromatids
separate, they will be full-fledged chromosomes.
Cell Cycle Regulation
We’ve already said that replication occurs during the S phase of interphase, so what happens during G1 and G2?
During these stages, the cell performs metabolic reactions and produces organelles, proteins, and enzymes. For
example, during G1, the cell produces all of the enzymes required for DNA replication (DNA helicase, DNA
polymerase, and DNA ligase, which are explained later in this chapter). By the way, G stands for “gap,” but we can
also associate it with “growth.” These three phases are highly regulated by checkpoints and special proteins called
cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).
Cell cycle checkpoints are control mechanisms that make
