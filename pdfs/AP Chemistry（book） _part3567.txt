, the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is closer to -57 kJ>mol. The concen-
tration of ATP inside a living cell is in the range of 1–10 mM, and a typical human metab-
olizes her or his body mass of ATP in one day! ATP is continually made from ADP and 
continually converted back to ADP
, releasing energy that can be harnessed by other cel-
lular reactions.
Arsenic, in the form of its oxides, has been known as a poison for 
centuries. The current Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
standard for arsenic in public water supplies is 10 ppb (equivalent 
to 10 mg>L). Most regions of the United States tend to have low to 
moderate (2–10 ppb) groundwater arsenic levels (Figure 22.28). The 
western region tends to have higher levels, coming mainly from nat-
ural geological sources in the area. Estimates, for example, indicate 
that 35% of water-supply wells in Arizona have arsenic concentra-
tions above 10 ppb.
The problem of arsenic in drinking water in the United States 
is dwarfed
