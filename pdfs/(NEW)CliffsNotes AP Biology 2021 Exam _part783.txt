, and cytokinesis, the cell structures involved in cell division, and the similarities of
and differences between plant and animal cell division.
Part I: Modeling Mitosis
In this part of the investigation, you use clay, pipe cleaners, socks, or beads to represent chromosomes. You display
the various stages of the cell cycle using these model chromosomes.
Part II: Evaluating an Environmental Effect on Mitosis
Various chemicals in the environment have the potential to influence mitotic activity. Lectins, a class of proteins
that bind specifically to carbohydrate molecules, occur naturally throughout nature and serve various functions. In
animals, they serve as cell-membrane receptors or facilitate cell adhesion or immune functions. In plants, their
functions include defensive proteins that disrupt the digestion of predators that eat them. In addition, certain soil
fungi secrete lectins that act as mitogens (substances that induce mitosis), influencing mitotic activity in the growing
root
