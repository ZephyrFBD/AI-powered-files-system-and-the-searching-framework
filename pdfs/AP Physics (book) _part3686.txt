 type represent a different age in the life cycle of a star? Astronomers
and astrophysicists today believe the latter is the case. Note, however, that we
cannot actually follow any but the tiniest part of the life cycle of any given star
because they live for ages vastly greater than ours, on the order of millions or
billions of years. Nonetheless, let us follow the process of stellar evolution from
the birth to the death of a star, as astrophysicists have theoretically reconstructed
it today.
Stars are born, it is believed, when gaseous clouds (mostly hydrogen) contract
due to the pull of gravity. A huge gas cloud might fragment into numerous con-
tracting masses, each mass centered in an area where the density is only slightly
greater than that at nearby points. Once such “globules” form, gravity causes
each to contract in toward its center of mass. As the particles of such a protostar
accelerate inward, their kinetic energy increases. Eventually, when the kinetic
energy is sufficien
