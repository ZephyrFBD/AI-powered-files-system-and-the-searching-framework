 minerals. Solutions of borax are alkaline, and the substance is used in 
various laundry and cleaning products.
The interhalogen compound BrF3 is a volatile, straw-colored liquid. The compound exhibits appreciable electrical conductivity 
because of autoionization (“solv” refers to BrF3 as the solvent):
2 BrF31l2 ∆ BrF2
+1solv2 + BrF4
-1solv2
(a) What are the molecular structures of the BrF2
+ and BrF4
- ions?
(b) The electrical conductivity of BrF3 decreases with increasing temperature. Is the autoionization process exothermic or endothermic?
(c) One chemical characteristic of BrF3 is that it acts as a Lewis acid toward fluoride ions. What do we expect will happen when 
KBr is dissolved in BrF3?

SOLUTION
(a) The BrF2
+ ion has 7 + 2172 - 1 = 20 valence-shell electrons. 
The Lewis structure for the ion is

Because there are four electron domains around the central Br 
atom, the resulting electron domain geometry is tetrahe
