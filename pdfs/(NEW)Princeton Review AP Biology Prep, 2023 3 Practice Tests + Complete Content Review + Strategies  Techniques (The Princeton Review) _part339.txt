RNA
Before we discuss transcription of RNA, let’s talk about its structure. Although RNA is also made up of nucleotides,
it differs from DNA in three ways.
1. RNA is single-stranded, not double-stranded.
2. The five-carbon sugar in RNA is ribose instead of deoxyribose.
3. The RNA nitrogenous bases are adenine, guanine, cytosine, and a different base called uracil. Uracil replaces
thymine as adenine’s partner.
Here’s a table to compare DNA and RNA. Keep these differences in mind—the testing board loves to test you on
them.

There are three main types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA).
All three types of RNA are key players in the synthesis of proteins:
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a temporary R
