become activated to proliferate according to clonal selection. These resulting CTLs
then identify non-APCs displaying the same MHC I-embedded antigens (for example, viral proteins)â€”for example, the
CTLs identify infected host cells.
Intracellularly, infected cells typically die after the infecting pathogen replicates to a sufficient concentration and lyses the
cell, as many viruses do. CTLs attempt to identify and destroy infected cells before the pathogen can replicate and escape,
thereby halting the progression of intracellular infections. CTLs also support NK lymphocytes to destroy early cancers.
Cytokines secreted by the TH1 response that stimulates macrophages also stimulate CTLs and enhance their ability to
identify and destroy infected cells and tumors.
CTLs sense MHC I-embedded antigens by directly interacting with infected cells via their TCRs. Binding of TCRs with
antigens activates CTLs to release perforin and granzyme, degradative enzymes that will induce apoptosis of the i
