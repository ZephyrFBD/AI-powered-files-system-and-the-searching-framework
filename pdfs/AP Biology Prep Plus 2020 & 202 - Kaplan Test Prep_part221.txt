 the RNA before
packaging.
(B)
Since RNA viruses use the host’s DNA-editing mechanisms on
their RNA, error-prone RdRPs are acceptable.
(C)
The high mutation rate leads to increased variability and rapid
evolution.

10. While viruses that infect bacteria may seem beneficial with
respect to curing bacterial illnesses, they can also cause adverse
eﬀects to occur by providing harmless bacteria with genetic
information that allows them to become pathogenic. For
example, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Vibrio cholerae,
and Shigella only become harmful when viruses transfer the
genes that produce toxic substances to them. This allows them to
infect humans and cause diarrhoeal disease, in addition to other,
possibly fatal, symptoms.
Which of the following best explains how a specialized gene
encoding a particular pathogenic toxin can be consistently
incorporated into new bacterial genomes?
The virus integrates its genetic information into a specific
location on a host cell’s chrom
