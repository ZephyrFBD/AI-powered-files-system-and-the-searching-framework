n the value of x so that 
all concentrations are positive? (c) By putting the equilib-
rium concentrations (in terms of x) into the equilibrium- 
constant expression, derive an equation that can be 
solved for x. (d) The equation from part (c) is a cubic equa-
tion (one that has the form ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0). In 
general, cubic equations cannot be solved in closed form. 
However, you can estimate the solution by plotting the 
cubic equation in the allowed range of x that you spec-
ified in part (b). The point at which the cubic equation 
crosses the x-axis is the solution. (e) From the plot in part 
(d), estimate the equilibrium concentrations of A, B, and 
C. (Hint: You can check the accuracy of your answer by 
substituting these concentrations into the equilibrium 
expression.)
