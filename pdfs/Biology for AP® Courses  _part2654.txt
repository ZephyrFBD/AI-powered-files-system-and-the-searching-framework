The structure of plant roots, stems, and leaves facilitates the transport of water, nutrients, and photosynthates throughout the
plant. The phloem and xylem are the main tissues responsible for this movement. Water potential, evapotranspiration, and
stomatal regulation influence how water and nutrients are transported in plants. To understand how
