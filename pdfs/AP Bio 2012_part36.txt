Carnivores have more teeth that are 
specialized for ripping food while 
herbivores have more teeth that are 
specialized for grinding food. 
(D) Plants generally use starch molecules for 
storage while animals use glycogen and fats 
for storage. 
 
 
25. Paramecia are unicellular protists that have 
contractile vacuoles to remove excess intracellular 
water. In an experimental investigation, paramecia 
were placed in salt solutions of increasing 
osmolarity. The rate at which the contractile 
vacuole contracted to pump out excess water was 
determined and plotted against osmolarity of the 
solutions, as shown in the graph. Which of the 
following is the correct explanation for the data? 
(A) At higher osmolarity, lower rates of 
contraction are required because more salt 
diffuses into the paramecia. 
(B) The contraction rate increases as the 
osmolarity decreases because the amount of 
water entering the paramecia by osmosis 
increases. 
(C) The contractile vacuole is less efficient
