rugs, sometimes called a drug
“cocktail.” By attacking the virus at different stages of its replicative cycle, it is much more difficult for the virus to develop
resistance to multiple drugs at the same time. Still, even with the use of combination HAART therapy, there is concern that,
over time, the virus will develop resistance to this therapy. Thus, new anti-HIV drugs are constantly being developed with
the hope of continuing the battle against this highly fatal virus.

Applied Virology
The study of viruses has led to the development of a variety of new ways to treat non-viral diseases.
Viruses have been used in gene therapy. Gene therapy is used to treat genetic diseases such as severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a heritable, recessive disease in which children are born with severely
compromised immune systems. One common type of SCID is due to the lack of an enzyme, adenos
