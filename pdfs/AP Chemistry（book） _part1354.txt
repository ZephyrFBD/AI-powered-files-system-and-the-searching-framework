ous liquid 
ammonia to form a binary compound of sulfur and ni-
trogen. The compound is found to consist of 69.6% S and 
30.4% N. Measurements of its molecular mass yield a value 
of 184.3 g>mol. The compound occasionally detonates on 
being struck or when heated rapidly. The sulfur and nitrogen 
atoms of the molecule are joined in a ring. All the bonds in 
the ring are of the same length. (a) Calculate the empirical 
and molecular formulas for the substance. (b) Write Lewis 
structures for the molecule, based on the information you 
are given. (Hint: You should find a relatively small number 
of dominant Lewis structures.) (c) Predict the bond distances 
between the atoms in the ring. (Note: The S ¬ S distance in 
the S8 ring is 2.05 Å.) (d) The enthalpy of formation of the 
compound is estimated to be 480 kJ>mol-1. ∆Hf° of S(g) is 
222.8 kJ>mol. Estimate the average bond enthalpy in the 
compound.
