Can you combine two or more of the fore-
going reagents to initiate a chemical reaction that will pro-
duce metallic silver? Write a balanced chemical equation to 
represent this process. What ions are left behind in solution? 
 
(d) What is the theoretical yield of silver?
 4.98 Bronze is a solid solution of Cu(s) and Sn(s); solutions of met-
als like this that are solids are called alloys. There is a range 
of compositions over which the solution is considered a 
bronze. Bronzes are stronger and harder than either copper or 
tin alone. (a) A 100.0-g sample of a certain bronze is 90.0% 
copper by mass and 10.0% tin. Which metal can be called the 
solvent, and which the solute? (b) Based on part (a), calculate 
the concentration of the solute metal in the alloy in units of 
molarity, assuming a density of 7.9 g/cm3. (c) Suggest a reac-
tion that you could do to remove all the tin from this bronze 
to leave a pure copper sample. Justify your reasoning.
