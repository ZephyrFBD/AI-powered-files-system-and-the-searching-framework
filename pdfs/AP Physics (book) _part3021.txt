oton is scattered backward, returning in
the direction from which it came (a direct “head-on” collision),
and
So
NOTE The maximum shift in wavelength occurs for backward scattering, and it
is twice the Compton wavelength.
The Compton effect has been used to diagnose bone disease such as osteoporo-
sis. Gamma rays, which are photons of even shorter wavelength than X-rays, coming
from a radioactive source are scattered off bone material. The total intensity of
the scattered radiation is proportional to the density of electrons, which is in turn
proportional to the bone density. A low bone density may indicate osteoporosis.
