However, as the bacterial population increases, the individual bacteria begin to compete with each other for
resources. When the resources become limited, the population reaches its carrying capacity, and the curve levels off.
The population becomes restricted in size because of limited resources. This is referred to as logistic growth. Notice
from the graph on the previous page that the growth forms an S-shaped curve.
This kind of logistic growth can be calculated with the following equation:
 = maximum growth rate × Population Size × 
These growth patterns are associated with two kinds of life-history strategies: r-selected species and k-selected
species.
One More Equation for the Road
On the AP Exam, you may see the logistic growth equation written as 
.
Essentially it’s the same as the exponential equation except when the
population size approaches the carrying capacity, the growth rate approaches
zero.
Those who thrive in areas that are barren or uninhabited are known as r-str
