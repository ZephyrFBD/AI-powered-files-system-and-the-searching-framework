indicating whether or not the microbe was photosynthetic, 
such as the presence of photosynthetic pigments or 
membrane. The student may instead choose to use evidence 
of oxygen or oxides in the surrounding rock or to state 
that their absence indicates that the organism was not 
photosynthetic.
Scoring Guidelines for Free-Response Question 8
2 points maximum. 
Possible evidence that the organism was photosynthetic:
• 
Internal presence of photosynthetic membrane or chloroplast
• 
High levels of oxygen gas or oxides in the surrounding rock
• 
Evidence of photosynthetic pigments in cell
• 
Chemical analysis of the fossil shows the presence of molecules associated 
with the photosynthetic process
Possible evidence that the organism was not photosynthetic:
• 
Lack of photosynthetic membrane or chloroplast
• 
Surrounding rock suggests anaerobic environment
