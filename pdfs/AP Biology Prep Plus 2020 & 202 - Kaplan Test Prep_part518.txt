9. The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a
closed system tends to increase. The diagram above shows a
living cell. A living cell is an open system that does not violate the
second law of thermodynamics. This is most likely explained by
which of the following statements?
All the external energy obtained by the cell is used to form
ordered structures.
