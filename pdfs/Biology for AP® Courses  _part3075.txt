can then be read aloud by a computer.
A relatively new line of research for helping paralyzed patients, including those with ALS, to communicate
and retain a degree of self-sufficiency is called brain-computer interface (BCI) technology and is illustrated
in Figure 26.17. This technology sounds like something out of science fiction: it allows paralyzed patients
to control a computer using only their thoughts. There are several forms of BCI. Some forms use EEG
recordings from electrodes taped onto the skull. These recordings contain information from large
populations of neurons that can be decoded by a computer. Other forms of BCI require the implantation of
an array of electrodes smaller than a postage stamp in the arm and hand area of the motor cortex. This
form of BCI, while more invasive, is very powerful as each electrode can record actual action potentials from
one or more neurons. These signals are then sent to a computer, which has been trained to decode the
signal and feed it
