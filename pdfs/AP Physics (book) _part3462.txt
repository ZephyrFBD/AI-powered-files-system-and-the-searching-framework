on for a bomb far more powerful than any
previously known, and inform him that Germany might already have begun
development of such a bomb. Roosevelt responded by authorizing the program
known as the Manhattan Project, to see if a bomb could be built. Work began in
earnest after Fermi’s demonstration in 1942 that a sustained chain reaction was
possible. A new secret laboratory was developed on an isolated mesa in New
Mexico known as Los Alamos. Under the direction of J. Robert Oppenheimer
(1904–1967; Fig. 31–10), it became the home of famous scientists from all over
Europe and the United States.
