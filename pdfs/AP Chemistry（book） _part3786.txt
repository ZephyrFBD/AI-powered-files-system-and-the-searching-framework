the oxidation state of Fe 
in this complex? How many d electrons are associated with 
the Fe in this complex? (d) Would you expect this complex 
to be high spin or low spin? Explain.
 [23.88]  When Alfred Werner was developing the field of coordi-
nation chemistry, it was argued by some that the opti-
cal activity he observed in the chiral complexes he had 
prepared was due to the presence of carbon atoms in the 
molecule. To disprove this argument, Werner synthesized 
a chiral complex of cobalt that had no carbon atoms in it, 
and he was able to resolve it into its enantiomers. Design a 
cobalt(III) complex that would be chiral if it could be syn-
thesized and that contains no carbon atoms. (It may not be 
possible to synthesize the complex you design, but we will 
not worry about that for now.)
 23.89  Generally speaking, for a given metal and ligand, the sta-
bility of a coordination compound is greater for the metal 
in the +3 rather than in the +2 oxidation state (for met-
