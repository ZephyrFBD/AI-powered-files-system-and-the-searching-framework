From the 2013 Administration 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is a modified version of the 2013 AP Biology Exam. 
This Practice Exam is provided by the College Board for AP Exam preparation. Teachers are 
permitted to download the materials and make copies to use with their students in a 
classroom setting only. To maintain the security of this exam, teachers should collect all 
materials after their administration and keep them in a secure location. 
Exams may not be posted on school or personal websites, nor electronically redistributed for 
any reason. Further distribution of these materials outside of the secure College Board site 
disadvantages teachers who rely on uncirculated questions for classroom testing. Any 
additional distribution is in violation of the College Boardâ€™s copyright policies and may result 
in the termination of Practice Exam access for your school as well as the removal of access to 
other online services such as the AP Teacher Communi
