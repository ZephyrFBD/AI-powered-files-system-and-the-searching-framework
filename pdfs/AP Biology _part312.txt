–53), while working in the lab of Maurice
Wilkins, carried out the X-ray crystallography analysis of DNA that
showed DNA to be a helix. (Dr. Franklin’s Photo 51 is famous.) Her work
was critical to Watson and Crick. Although Maurice Wilkins shared the
Nobel prize with Watson and Crick, Rosalind Franklin did not. She had
died by the time the prize was awarded, and the prize is not awarded
posthumously.

The proof that DNA is the carrier of genetic information involved a number of
important historic experiments.
Watson and Crick (1953), while working at Cambridge University,
proposed the double helix structure of DNA in a one-page paper in the
British journal Nature. Throughout the 1940s, until 1953, many scientists
worked to understand the structure of DNA. All the data that Watson and
Crick used to build their model of DNA derived from other scientists who
published earlier. Two major pieces of information they used were the
biochemical analysis of DNA (from Erwin Chargaff) and th
