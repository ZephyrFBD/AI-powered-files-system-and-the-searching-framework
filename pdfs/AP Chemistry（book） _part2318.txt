 14.31 Consider the following reaction:
CH3Br1aq2 + OH -1aq2 ยก CH3OH1aq2 + Br-1aq2
 
 The rate law for this reaction is first order in CH3Br and 
first order in OH -. When 3CH3Br4 is 5.0 * 10-3 M and 
3OH -4 is 0.050 M, the reaction rate at 298 K is 0.0432 M>s. 
(a) What is the value of the rate constant? (b) What are 
the units of the rate constant? (c) What would happen 
to the rate if the concentration of OH -  were tripled? 
 
(d) What would happen to the rate if the concentration 
of both reactants were tripled?
 14.32 The reaction between ethyl bromide 1C2H5Br2 
and hydroxide ion in ethyl alcohol at 330 K, 
C2H5Br1alc2 + OH -1alc2 ยก  C2H5OH1l2 + Br -1alc2, 
is first order each in ethyl bromide and hydroxide ion. 
When 3C2H5Br4 is 0.0477 M and 3OH -4 is 0.100 M, the 
rate of disappearance of ethyl bromide is 1.7 * 10-7 M>s. 
(a) What is the value of the rate constant? (b) What are 
the units of the rate constant? (c) How would the rate of 
disappearance of ethy
