 chromosomes line up along the center of the cell but
the number of chromosomes does not change. In telophase, two new nuclei are formed and the number of
chromosomes per cell at the end of telophase is less than it was at the beginning of telophase. Thus, choice (D)
is also incorrect.
4. (B)  During metaphase, chromosomes line up in the center of the cell on the metaphase plate. Prophase is when
chromosomes condense and become visible, so choice (A) is incorrect. Anaphase is when sister chromatids
separate and begin to move to opposite ends of the cell, so choice (C) is incorrect. Telophase is when two new
nuclei are formed, so choice (D) is also incorrect.
5. (D)  Interphase consists of G1, S, and G2. Therefore, the number of cells in interphase is 73 + 89 + 68 = 230
cells. The total number of cells is 73 + 89 + 68 + 43 = 273. So the percentage of cells in interphase is 
. Choice (A) is incorrect because 16% is the approximate percentage of cells that are in mitosis.
Choice (B) is in
