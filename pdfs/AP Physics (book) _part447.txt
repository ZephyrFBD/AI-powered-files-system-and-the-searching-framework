its tension force exceeds
When this
device is placed in an elevator, which accelerates upward,
only the lines attached to the 2.05 and 2.00 kg masses do
not break. Within what range is the elevator’s acceleration?

85. Two rock climbers, Jim and Karen, use safety ropes of simi-
lar length. Karen’s rope is more elastic, called a dynamic
rope by climbers. Jim has a static rope, not recommended
for safety purposes in pro climbing. (a) Karen (Fig. 4–71)
falls freely about 2.0 m and then the rope stops her over a
distance of 1.0 m. Estimate how large a force (assume 
constant) she will feel from the rope. (Express the result 
in multiples of her weight.) (b) In a similar fall, Jim’s rope
stretches by only 30 cm. How many times his weight will
the rope pull on him? Wh
