and T cells, causing them to undergo rapid cell division. The cells
form populations of effector cells and memory cells.
EFFECTOR PHASE: After being activated, B cells produce a humoral
response; they produce antibodies. T cells engage in a cell-
mediated response. See Figure 17.3.
*Other blood cell types—eosinophils and basophils—play a lesser role in adaptive immunity and
are beyond the scope of the AP course.
T Lymphocytes—T Cells
There are several types of T cells, but they all form in the bone marrow
and mature in the thymus gland (from which they get their name). They
fight pathogens in the cell-mediated immune response. In general, the
activation process begins when T cell antigen receptors recognize and
bind to antigens that are displayed on the surface of antigen-presenting
cells (APCs) by a molecule called MHC, major histocompatibility
complex. Examples of APCs are macrophages, dendritic cells, and
sometimes B cells. Each T cell displays specific
