er of moles of NaOH in 20.0 mL of solu-
tion allows us to calculate the molarity of this solution:
 Molarity NaOH = mol NaOH
L soln
 
 = a 4.56 * 10-2 mol NaOH
20.0 mL soln
b a 1000 mL soln
1 L soln
b
 = 2.28 mol NaOH
L soln
= 2.28 M
then slowly added until the solution turns pink, telling us that the neutralization reaction 
between HCl and NaOH is complete. The standard solution is added from a burette so that 
we can accurately determine the added volume of NaOH solution. Knowing the volumes 
of both solutions and the concentration of the standard solution, we can calculate the 
concentration of the unknown solution as diagrammed in Figure 4.19.

Analyze We are given the volume (20.2 mL) and molarity (0.100 M)  
of a solution of Ag+ and the chemical equation for reaction of this 
ion with Cl-. We are asked to calculat
