mitigating excessive water loss.
Characteristics of a 
GOOD Response 
(Part a) The student is able to draw a graph showing the 
effect of temperature change on the rate of transpiration 
that possesses properly labeled and scaled axes with points 
accurately plotted. The student may either connect the 
points or construct an accurate best-fit line. The student 
is able to write a coherent paragraph with appropriate 
terminology and elaboration to explain that the shape of 
the curve from 23â€“28 degrees demonstrates that the rate of 
evaporation increases with increasing temperature and/or 
that at higher temperatures there are more open stomata. 
The student also recognizes the leveling off of the line and  
is able to explain that as the temperature rises too high,  
the plant begins to close its stomata to prevent excessive  
water loss.
(Part b) The student is able to properly draw a curve that 
possesses properly labeled and scaled axes indicating a 
measure of humidity. The st
