f the amino acid (Figure 9.11). The transfer of the phosphate is catalyzed by an
enzyme called a kinase. Various kinases are named for the substrate they phosphorylate. Phosphorylation of serine and
threonine residues often activates enzymes. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues can either affect the activity of an enzyme
or create a binding site that interacts with downstream components in the signaling cascade. Phosphorylation may activate
or inactivate enzymes, and the reversal of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation by a phosphatase, will reverse the effect.

Figure 9.11 In protein phosphorylation, a phosphate group (PO4-3 ) is added to residues of the amino acids serine,
threonine, and tyrosine.
Second Messengers
Second messengers are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling
molecule to the receptor. These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of ce
