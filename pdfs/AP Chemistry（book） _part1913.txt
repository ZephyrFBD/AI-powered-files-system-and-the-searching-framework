ap, 
we would expect GaN to have a larger band gap than GaP
.
Check External references show that the band gap of GaP is  
2.26 eV, ZnS is 3.6 eV, and GaN is 3.4 eV.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of these statements is false?
(a) As you go down column 4A in the periodic table, the el-
emental solids become more electrically conducting. (b) As 
you go down column 4A in the periodic table, the band gaps 
of the elemental solids decrease. (c) The valence electron 
count for a compound semiconductor averages out to four 
per atom. (d) Band gap energies of semiconductors range 
from ∼0.1 to 3.5 eV. (e) In general, the more polar the bonds 
are in compound semiconductors, the smaller the band gap.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Will ZnSe have a larger or smaller band gap than ZnS?
Semiconductor doping
The electrical conductivity of a semiconductor is influenced by the presence of small 
numbers of impurity atoms. The process of adding controlled amounts of impurity 
atoms to a material is known as do
