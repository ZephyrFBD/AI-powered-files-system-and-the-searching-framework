ger the impact time of an
impulse, the smaller the force can be for the same momentum
change, and hence the smaller the deformation of the object
on which the force acts. On this basis, explain the value of
air bags, which are intended to inflate during an automobile
collision and reduce the possibility of fracture or death.
8. If a falling ball were to make a perfectly elastic collision with
the floor, would it rebound to its original height? Explain.
9. A boy stands on the back of a rowboat and dives into the
water. What happens to the boat as he leaves it? Explain.
10. It is said that in ancient times a rich man with a bag of 
gold coins was stranded on the surface of a frozen lake.
Because the ice was frictionless, he could not push himself

11. The speed of a tennis ball on the return of a serve can be
just as fast as the serve, even though the racket isnâ€™t swung
very fast. How can this
