are Service during World War I and developed the use of chlo-
rine as a poison-gas weapon. Consequently, the decision to award 
him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918 was the subject of consider-
able controversy and criticism. The ultimate irony, however, came in 
1933 when Haber was expelled from Germany because he was Jewish.

▲ Figure 15.5 A high-pressure steel reactor used in the Haber process 
is on display at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany where the 
Haber process was developed.
for the Haber process, N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ∆2 NH31g2, the equilibrium-constant 
expression is

[15.9]
Once we know the balanced chemical equation for a reaction that reaches equilib-
rium, we can write the equilibrium-constant expression even if we do not know the reac-
tion mechanism.
The equilibrium-constant expression depends only on the stoichiometry  
of the reaction, not on its mechanism.
In this way equilibrium-constant expr
