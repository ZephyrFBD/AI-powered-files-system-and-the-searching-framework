tems which turn waveform
information into holographic reality. When we are not observing
something our reality reverts from a holographic state to a waveform
state. This relates to the same principle as a falling tree not making a
noise unless someone is there to hear it or decode it. The concept
makes sense from the simulation perspective. A computer is not
decoding all the information in a Wi-Fi ﬁeld all the time and only
decodes or brings into reality on the screen that part of Wi-Fi that it’s
decoding – focusing upon – at that moment.
Figure 18: Virtual reality technology ‘hacks’ into the body’s five-sense decoding system.
Figure 19: The result can be experienced as very ‘real’.
Interestingly, Professor Donald Hoﬀman at the Department of
Cognitive Sciences at the University of California, Irvine, says that
our experienced reality is like a computer interface that shows us
only the level with which we interact while hiding all that exists
beyond it: ‘Evolution shaped us with a user
