MRI makes use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).]

1 Sv = 100 rem.
rem = rad * RBE,
1 Gy = 1 Jkg = 100 rad.
10–2 Jkg
1 Bq = 1 decays.
1 Ci = 3.70 * 1010
Summary
1. Fill in the missing particles or nuclei:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
where d stands for deuterium.
2. When 
is bombarded by deuterons 
an 
particle
is emitted. What is the resulting nuclide? Write down the
reaction equation.
3. Why are neutrons such good projectiles for producing
nuclear reactions?
4. What is the Q-value for radioactive decay reactions?
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d) The sign of Q depends on the nucleus.
5. The energy from nuclear fission appears in the form of
thermal energy—but the thermal energy of what?
6. (a) If 
released only 1.5 neutrons per fission on average
(instead of 2.5), would a chain reaction be possible? (b) If
so, how would the chain reaction be different than if 
3 neutrons were released per fission?
7. Why can’t uranium be enriched by chemical means
