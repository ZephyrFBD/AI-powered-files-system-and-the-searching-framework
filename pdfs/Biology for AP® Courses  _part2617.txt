nd secondary xylem by the vascular cambium, plus the action of
cork cambium, which forms the tough outermost layer of the stem. The cells of the secondary xylem contain lignin, which
provides hardiness and strength.
In woody plants, cork cambium is the outermost lateral meristem. It produces cork cells (bark) containing a waxy substance
known as suberin that can repel water. The bark protects the plant against physical damage and helps reduce water loss.
The cork cambium also produces a layer of cells known as phelloderm, which grows inward from the cambium. The cork
cambium, cork cells, and phelloderm are collectively termed the periderm. The periderm substitutes for the epidermis
in mature plants. In some plants, the periderm has many openings, known as lenticels, which allow the interior cells to
exchange gases with the outside atmosphere (Figure 23.11). This supplies oxygen to the living and metabolically active
cells of the cortex, xylem and phloem.
