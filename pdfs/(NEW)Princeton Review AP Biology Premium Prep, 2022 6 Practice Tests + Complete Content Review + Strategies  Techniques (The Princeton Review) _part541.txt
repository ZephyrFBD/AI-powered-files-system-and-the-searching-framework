1.
A
In order to answer this question, you must first calculate how much weight each subject lost and then
divide by the number of subjects (in this case, five).
Note that subject 3 gained four pounds. Total weight lost is 60 pounds (remember to subtract 4 pounds for
subject 3, not add), divided by 5 subjects is 12 pounds. The average weight lost is 12 pounds ((A) is
correct).
2.
C
Plant 6 is 68 inches. All the answer choices list median values smaller than this, so the answer must start
with “Yes” (eliminate (B) and (D)). In order to determine the median height for all six plants, their
height
