lanced equation:
14 H+1aq2 + Cr2O7
2-1aq2 + 6 Cl-1aq2 ¡ 2 Cr3+1aq2 + 7 H2O1l2 + 3 Cl21g2 
Step 5: There are equal numbers of atoms of 
each kind on the two sides of the equation 
(14 H, 2 Cr, 7 O, 6 Cl). In addition, the charge 
is the same on the two sides 16+2. Thus, the 
equation is balanced.

Solve
Step 1: We write the incomplete, 
unbalanced half-reactions:
Analyze We are given an incomplete equation for a basic redox 
reaction and asked to balance it.
Plan We go through the first steps of our procedure as if the 
reaction were occurring in acidic solution. We then add the 
appropriate number of OH- to each side of the equation, combin-
ing H+ and OH- to form H2O. We complete the process by simpli-
fying the equation.
