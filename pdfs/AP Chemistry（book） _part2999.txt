system, w, are not state functionsâ€”their values depend on the specific way in which the 
change occurs. That is, their values depend on the path taken between states. Under-
standing two kinds of paths, those that are reversible and those that are irreversible, is a 
key to understanding spontaneity.
Reversible and Irreversible Processes
For any process, we can imagine a hypothetical, ideal path that can be reversed to restore 
both the system and its surroundings to exactly their original states. This means that 
after the process is reversed, both the system and surroundings are unchanged. Such an 
ideal process is said to be reversible.
t A reversible process is one for which we can restore the system to its original con-
dition with no change to the surroundings.
t An irreversible process is one that leaves the surroundings somehow changed 
when the system is restored to its original state.
