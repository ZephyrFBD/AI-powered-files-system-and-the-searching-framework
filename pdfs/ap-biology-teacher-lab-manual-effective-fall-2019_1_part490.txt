A cross was made between wild type (+; black) and tan (tn) strains. The resulting zygote 
produces either parental type asci, which have four black and four tan spores in a row 
(4:4 pattern), or recombinant asci, which do not have this pattern. 
•  How do you explain the differences between the recombinant asci and the parental 
types? 
•  What meiotic event can account for this difference? 
•  Using the model chromosomes from Part 4, predict the possible meiotic outcomes. 
1. Place a drop of water onto the microscope slide. 
2. Gently scrape some perithecia from the agar plate near where the two strains meet. 
3. Place a cover slip over the perithecia and put a scientific cleaning wipe over the cover 
slip. 
4. Gently press down on the cover slip using the eraser end of a pencil. 
5. Count at least 50 asci, and score them as either parental or recombinant (crossing  
over).
