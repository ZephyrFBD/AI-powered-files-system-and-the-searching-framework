tocol for
the PCR test. What a remarkable feat given the PCR cannot test for
infectious disease and even more so when you think that Drosten
said that his method of testing for SARS-CoV-2 was developed
‘without having virus material available’. He developed a test for a
‘virus’ that he didn’t have and had never seen. Let that sink in as you
survey the global devastation that came from what he did. The
whole catastrophe of Drosten’s ‘test’ was based on the alleged
genetic sequence published by Chinese scientists on the Internet. We
will see in the next chapter that this alleged ‘genetic sequence’ has
never been produced by China or anyone and cannot be when there
is no SARS-CoV-2. Drosten, however, doesn’t seem to let liĴle details
like that get in the way. He was the lead author with Victor Corman
from the same Charité Hospital of the paper ‘Detection of 2019 novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time PCR‘ published in a magazine
called Eurosurveillance. This became known as the Corman
