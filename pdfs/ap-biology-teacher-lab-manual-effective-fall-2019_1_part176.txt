n. The numbers involved 
are not very workable for the individual student or even for a small group of students. 
For this reason, it is recommended that the first step of this lab be conducted at the 
class level. The minimal population size for part one is about 120–180 plants per class. 
Require each student in your class to care for enough plants to achieve this population 
size. This size of population will generally express adequate phenotypic variation for 
a trait, such as trichomes. Consider directing your students toward this trait because 
trichomes are quantifiable. There is no need to count every hair — just a sample. One 
possible sampling procedure would be to count the hairs along the edge of the right side
