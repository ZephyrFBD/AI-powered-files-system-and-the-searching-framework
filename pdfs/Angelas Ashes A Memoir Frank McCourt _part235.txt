 goes to die on the bridge 
 
 of Toome today. He comes round the corner at the top of the lane and 
 
 starts Kevin Barry. He sings a verse, stops, holds on to a wall, cries over 
 
 Kevin Barry.People stick their heads out windows and doors and tell him, 
 
 For Jasus’ sake, put a sock in it. Some of us have to get up in the morning 
 
 for work. Go home and sing your feckin’ patriotic songs. 
 
 He stands in the middle of the lane and tells the world to step outside, 
 
 he’s ready to fight, ready to fight and die for Ireland, which is 
 
 more than he can say for the men of Limerick, who are known the 
 
 110 
 
 length and breadth of the world for collaborating with the perfidious 
 
 Saxons. 
 
 He’s pushing in our door and singing, 
 
  
  
 And if, when all a vigil keep, 
 
 The West’s asleep, the West’s asleep! 
 
 Alas! and well my Erin weep, 
 
 That Connacht lies in slumber deep, 
 
 But hark! a voice like thunder spake 
 
 ‘The West’s awake! the West’s awake! 
 
 Sing, Oh,
