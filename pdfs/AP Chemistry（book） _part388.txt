O—pick the one that best fits each description. Use each element 
only once: (a) an alkali metal, (b) an alkaline earth metal, (c) a 
noble gas, (d) a halogen, (e) a metalloid, (f) a nonmetal listed in 
group 1A, (g) a metal that forms a 3+  ion, (h) a nonmetal that

 2.101  The first atoms of seaborgium (Sg) were identified in 1974. 
The longest-lived isotope of Sg has a mass number of 266. 
 
(a) How many protons, electrons, and neutrons are in an 
266Sg atom? (b) Atoms of Sg are very unstable, and it is there-
fore difficult to study this element’s properties. Based on the 
position of Sg in the periodic table, what element should it 
most closely resemble in its chemical properties?
 2.102  The explosion of an atomic bomb releases many radioactive 
isotopes, including strontium-90. Considering the location of 
strontium in the periodic table, suggest a reason for the fact 
that this
