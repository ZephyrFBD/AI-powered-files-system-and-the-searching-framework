9.8  The drawing below shows the overlap of two hybrid orbitals 
to form a bond in a hydrocarbon. (a) Which of the follow-
ing types of bonds is being formed: (i) C ¬C s, (ii) C ¬C p, 
or (iii) C ¬H s? (b) Which of the following could be the 
identity of the hydrocarbon: (i) CH4, (ii) C2H6, (iii) C2H4, or 
 
(iv) C2H2? [Section 9.6]
