ires some explanation. Electrons with the same value of n are referred to as
being in the same shell. Electrons with
are in one shell (the K shell), those
with
are in a second shell (the L shell), those with
are in the 
third (M) shell, and so on. Electrons with the same values of n and are referred
to as being in the same subshell. Letters are often used to specify the value of 
as shown in Table 28–3. That is,
is the s subshell;
is the p subshell;
is the d subshell; beginning with
the letters follow the alphabet,
f, g, h, i, and so on. (The first letters s, p, d, and f were originally abbreviations 
of “sharp,”“principal,”“diffuse,” and “fundamental,” terms referring to the experi-
mental spectra.)
The Pauli exclusion principle limits the number of electrons possible in each
shell and subshell. For any value of 
there are 
possible 
values (
can
be any integer from 1 to 
from 
to 
or zero), and two possible 
values.
There can be, therefore, at most 
electrons in any 
subshell. For
