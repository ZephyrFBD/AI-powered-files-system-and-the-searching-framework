sgenic bacteria, agricultural
plants such as corn and rice, and farm animals produce protein products such as hormones and vaccines that benefit humans.
(It is important to remind ourselves that recombinant technology is possible because the genetic code is universal, and
the processes of transcription and translation are fundamentally the same in all organisms.) Cloning produces genetically
identical copies of DNA, cells, or even entire organisms (reproductive cloning). Genetic testing identifies disease-causing
genes, and gene therapy can be used to treat or cure an inheritable disease. However, questions emerge from these
technologies including the safety of GMOs and privacy issues.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience
