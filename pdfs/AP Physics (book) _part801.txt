Angular acceleration (denoted by 
the Greek lowercase letter alpha), in analogy
to linear acceleration, is defined as the change in angular velocity divided by the
time required to make this change. The average angular acceleration is defined as
(8;3a)
where 
is the angular velocity initially, and 
is the angular velocity after a
time interval 
Instantaneous angular acceleration is defined as the limit of this
ratio as 
approaches zero:

Since 
is the same for all points of a rotating object, Eq. 8–3 tells us that 
also
will be the same for all points. Thus,
and 
are properties of the rotating object
as a whole. With
