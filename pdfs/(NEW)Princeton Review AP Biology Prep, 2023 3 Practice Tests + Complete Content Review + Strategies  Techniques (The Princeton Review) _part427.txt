members of their species. These signals, which can be
chemical, visual, electrical, or tactile, are often used to influence mating and social behavior.
Chemical signals are one of the most common forms of communication among animals. Pheromones, for instance,
are chemical signals between members of the same species that stimulate olfactory receptors and ultimately affect
behavior. For example, when female insects give off their pheromones, they attract males from great distances.
Visual signals also play an important role in the behavior observed among members of a species. For example,
fireflies produce pulsed flashes that can be seen by other fireflies far away. The flashes are sexual displays that help
male and female fireflies identify and locate each other in the dark.
Other animals use electrical channels to communicate. Some fish generate and receive weak electrical fields. Others
use tactile signals and have mechanoreceptors in their skin to detect prey. For instance, cave-dwel
