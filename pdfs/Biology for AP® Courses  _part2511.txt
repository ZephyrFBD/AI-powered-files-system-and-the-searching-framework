ment to living things, because it is part of nucleotides and amino acids that are the
building blocks of nucleic acids and proteins, respectively. Nitrogen is usually the most limiting element in terrestrial
ecosystems, with atmospheric nitrogen, N2, providing the largest pool of available nitrogen. However, eukaryotes cannot
use atmospheric, gaseous nitrogen to synthesize macromolecules. Fortunately, nitrogen can be “fixed,” meaning it is
converted into ammonia (NH3) either biologically or abiotically. Abiotic nitrogen fixation occurs as a result of lightning or
by industrial processes.
Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes: soil bacteria, cyanobacteria, and Frankia
spp. (filamentous bacteria interacting with actinorhizal plants such as alder, bayberry, and sweet fern). After photosynthesis,
BNF is the second most important biological process on Earth. The equation representing the process is as follows
N2  + 16ATP + 8e− + 8H+  → 2NH3  + 16ADP +
