and magnetic fields. The idea of the field was introduced somewhat later by 
Faraday, and was not generally used until Maxwell showed that all electric and
magnetic phenomena could be described using only four equations involving elec-
tric and magnetic fields. These equations, known as Maxwell’s equations, are the
basic equations for all electromagnetism. They are fundamental in the same sense
that Newton’s three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation are for
mechanics. In a sense, they are even more fundamental, because they are consistent
with the theory of relativity (Chapter 26), whereas Newton’s laws are not. Because
all of electromagnetism is contained in this set of four equations, Maxwell’s equa-
tions are considered one of the great triumphs of the human intellect.
Although we will not present Maxwell’s equations in mathematical form
since they involve calculus, we will summarize them here in words. They are:
