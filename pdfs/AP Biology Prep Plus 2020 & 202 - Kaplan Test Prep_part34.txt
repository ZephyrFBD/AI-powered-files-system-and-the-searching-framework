3. Researchers are comparing capillary action in two diﬀerent
species of plants by monitoring water flow with water-based dyes.
The first species is a flowering plant in which the walls of the
xylem are lined with negatively charged molecules. The second
species is a wilted Myrothamnus flabellifolia, a plant that becomes
brown and shriveled under drought conditions and is revived to
its original green color and appearance once water becomes
available. The researchers discovered that the walls of the water-
conducting vessels in desiccated Myrothamnus are lined with
hydrophobic molecules. Which of the following capillary activities
will most likely be observed by the researchers?
The dye will reach the same height in both plants because
the chemical nature of the vessel walls does not aﬀect
capillary action.
(A)
The dye will reach a higher point in Myrothamnus because the
hydrophobic walls increase the surface tension of water.

The dy
