Assume that two genes, A and B, are not linked. If the probability of
allele A being in a gamete is 12 and the probability of allele B being
in a gamete is 12, then the probability of BOTH A and B being in the
same gamete is

In guinea pigs, the gene for short hair is dominant, and the gene for
long hair is recessive. The gene for black hair color is dominant over
the gene for white hair color, which is recessive. A cross between
two guinea pigs produces a litter of 9 short-haired black guinea pigs
and 3 short-haired white guinea pigs. What is the most likely
genotype of the parent guinea pigs in this cross?
