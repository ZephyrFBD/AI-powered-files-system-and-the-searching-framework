Linkage maps can be constructed from data of
recombination frequencies.
Sex-linked genes are genes located on the X chromosome.
Examples are hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and
color blindness. Females can be carriers (X–X). However, they
must have two affected X chromosomes to express the condition
(X–X–). Males, on the other hand, express the condition if they
inherit only one X-linked mutation (X–Y). A father cannot pass an
X-linked condition to his sons because they inherit their Y
chromosome from him. However, all his daughters will inherit his
affected X chromosome and be carriers. Men who express an X-
linked condition inherit it from their mothers.
During development of the mammalian female, one of the X
chromosomes normally becomes inactivated. This phenomenon
equalizes the dosage of X chromosomes in males, who have only
one X chromosome, and females, who have two. The inactivated X
chromosome forms a dark spot near the nuclear membrane called a
Barr body.
