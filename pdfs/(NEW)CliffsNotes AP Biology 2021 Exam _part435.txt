teins, as is
the DNA of bacteria and cyanobacteria.
2. Ribosomes of mitochondria and chloroplasts resemble those of bacteria and cyanobacteria, with respect to size
and nucleotide sequence. 3. Mitochondria and chloroplasts reproduce independently of their eukaryotic host cell by
a process similar to the binary fission of bacteria.
4. Mitochondria and chloroplasts have two membranes (both phospholipid bilayers). The second membrane could
have been acquired when the introduced prokaryote is surrounded, in endocytosis fashion, by a vesicle produced by
the host prokaryote.
5. The thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts resemble the photosynthetic membranes of cyanobacteria.
