‡Electron-hole recombination in silicon results mostly in heat, as lattice vibrations called phonons.

electrons in different colors for each of
the two separate atoms. (In Fig. 29–26a

led to LEDs with higher 
and shorter wavelengths: first yellow, then finally in
1995, blue (InGaN). A blue LED was important because it gave the possibility of
