 OH-
ion necessary for nerve impulse conduction, muscle contractions and water balance
negatively charged subatomic particle that resides outside of the nucleus in the electron orbital; lacks functional
mass and has a negative charge of –1 unit
arrangement of electrons in an atom’s electron shell (for example, 1s22s22p6)
how electrons are spatially distributed surrounding the nucleus; the area where an electron is most likely
to be found
movement of electrons from one element to another; important in creation of ionic bonds
