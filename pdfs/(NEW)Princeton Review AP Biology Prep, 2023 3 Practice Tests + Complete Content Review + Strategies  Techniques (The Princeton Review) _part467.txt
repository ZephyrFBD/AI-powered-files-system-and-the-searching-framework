here is no bias in
picking which individuals from the population will be included in the sample. It is important that the sample is big
enough that the data from the experiment is a good representation of what would happen if the whole population
were measured.
Graphs are visual representations of data and are often used to reveal trends that might not be obvious by looking at
a table of numbers. There are six types of graphs you should be familiar with:
1. Bar graph
2. Pie graph
3. Histogram
4. Line graph
5. Box-and-whisker plot

Each of these is described more in the sections that follow. Pay attention to which graph is used when. On the AP

given to you on the exam.
A good graph must include the following things:

axes labeled with numbers, labels and units, and index marks
a frame or pe
