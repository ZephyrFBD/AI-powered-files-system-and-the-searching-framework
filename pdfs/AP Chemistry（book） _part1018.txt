 6.21  A laser pointer used in a lecture hall emits light at 650 nm. 
What is the frequency of this radiation? Using Figure 6.4, 
 
predict the color associated with this wavelength.
 6.22  It is possible to convert radiant energy into electrical energy 
using photovoltaic cells. Assuming equal efficiency of con-
version, would infrared or ultraviolet radiation yield more 
electrical energy on a per-photon basis?

 6.23  If human height were quantized in 1-foot increments, what 
would happen to the height of a child as she grows up: 
 
(i) The child’s height would never change, (ii) the child’s 
height would continuously get greater, (iii) the child’s height 
would increase in “jumps” of 1 foot at a time, or (iv) the 
child’s height would increase in jumps of 6 inches?
 6.24  Einstein’s 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect was the 
ﬁrst important application of Planck’s quantum hypothesis. 
Describe Planck’s original hypothesis, and expl
