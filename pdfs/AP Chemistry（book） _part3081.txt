Solve
(a) The normal boiling point is the temperature at which a pure 
liquid is in equilibrium with its vapor at a pressure of 1 atm:
Analyze (a) We must write a chemical equation that describes 
the physical equilibrium between liquid and gaseous CCl4 at the 
normal boiling point. (b) We must determine the value of ∆G° for 
CCl4, in equilibrium with its vapor at the normal boiling point. 
(c) We must estimate the normal boiling point of CCl4, based on 
available thermodynamic data.
Plan (a) The chemical equation is t
