c properties of water, for example, 
addressed the behavior of bulk water (or ice or water vapor) as a substance without con-
sidering any specific properties of individual H2O molecules.
To connect the microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of matter, scientists have 
developed the field of statistical thermodynamics, which uses the tools of statistics and 
probability to link the microscopic and macroscopic worlds. Here we show how entropy, 
which is a property of bulk matter, can be connected to the behavior of atoms and mole-
cules. Because the mathematics of statistical thermodynamics is complex, our discussion 
will be largely conceptual.
In our discussion of two gas molecules in the two-flask system in Figure 19.6, we saw 
that the number of possible arrangements helped explain why the gas expands.
Suppose we now consider one mole of an ideal gas in a particular thermodynamic 
state, which we can define by specifying the temperature, T, and volume, V, of the gas.
