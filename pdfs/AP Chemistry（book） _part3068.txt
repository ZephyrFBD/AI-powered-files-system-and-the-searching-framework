 As in calculating ∆H values, the phases of the reactants 
and products are important. As we predicted, ∆G° is less negative 
than ∆H° because of the decrease in entropy during the reaction.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
If a reaction is exothermic and its entropy change is  
positive, which statement is true? (a) The reaction is 
spontaneous at all temperatures (b) The reaction  
is nonspontaneous at all temperatures (c) The reaction is 
spontaneous only at higher temperatures (d) The reaction is 
spontaneous only at lower temperatures
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
For the combustion of butane at 298 K, 
2 C4H101g2 + 13 O21g2 ¡ 8 CO21g2 + 10 H2O1g2, do you 
expect ∆G° to be more negative or less negative than ∆H°?
The Gibbs free energy is a remarkable thermodynamic quantity. 
Because so many chemical reactions are carried out under conditions 
of near-constant pressure and temperature, chemists, biochemists, 
and engineers consider the sign and magnitude of ∆G as exception-
