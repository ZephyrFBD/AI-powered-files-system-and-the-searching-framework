or IBi. They could also be type O (ii), but they do not have to be.
(EVO-2 & IST-1)
(D) The section of the strand shows genes CDE inverted. (IST-1)
(A) Notice that, except for the odd results of 8 and 9, the ratio in the
offspring is close to 1 to 1 (83:86). That means that the parents had

to have been hybrid (TtSs) and homozygous recessive (ttss),
regardless of which traits are dominant and which are recessive.
Where do the unexpected offspring (8 short/smooth and 9
tall/wrinkled) come from? They result from a crossover in which
two traits, smooth and wrinkled, exchanged genes.
In order for linked genes to crossover, they must be located far apart
on one chromosome. Choice B cannot be correct because traits
located close together would be inherited together and not undergo
crossover. Choice C cannot be correct because, if these four traits
had assorted independently, the ratios of the offspring would have
