d by
the amount of sunlight they receive, the distance from the shore,
and the water depth and whether it is open water or ocean bottom.
CHEMICAL CYCLES
Although Earth receives a constant supply of energy from the sun,
chemicals must be recycled. Here are three chemical cycles: the water
cycle, the carbon cycle, and the nitrogen cycle.
The Water Cycle
Remember: Living systems depend on the properties of water that result
from its polarity and from hydrogen bonding.
Water evaporates from Earth, forms clouds, and rains over the oceans
and land. Some rain percolates through the soil and makes its way back to
the seas. Some evaporates directly from the land, but most evaporates from
plants by transpiration.
The oceans contain 97% of the water in the biosphere. About 2% is
locked in glaciers and polar ice caps, and the remaining 1% is in lakes,
rivers, and groundwater. A negligible amount is in the atmosphere.
The Carbon Cycle
Remember: Carbon moves from the environment to organisms, where
