 the planets, he concluded that the force required to hold the different 
planets in their orbits around the Sun seems to diminish as the inverse square of
their distance from the Sun. This led him to believe that it is also the gravitational
force that acts between the Sun and each of the planets to keep them in their orbits.
And if gravity acts between these objects, why not between all objects? Thus he 
proposed his law of universal gravitation, which we can state as follows:
Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that 
is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to 
the square of the distance between them. This force acts along the line 
joining the two particles.
The magnitude of the gravitational force can be written as
(5;4)
where 
and 
are the masses of the two particles, r is the distance between
them, and G is a universal constant which must be measured experimentally.
The value of G must be very small, since we
