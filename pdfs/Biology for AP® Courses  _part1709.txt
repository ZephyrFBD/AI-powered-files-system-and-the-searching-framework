olypeptide subunits, two of which are
identical. These subunits, denoted α , α , β ,
and β ’, comprise the polymerase core enzyme.
There is a fifth subunit that is involved in
translation initiation. The polymerase comprised
of all four subunits is called the holoenzyme.
c.
In prokaryotes the polymerase is composed of
five polypeptide subunits, two of which are
identical. Four of these subunits, denoted α , α ,
β , and β ’, comprise the polymerase
holoenzyme. The fifth subunit, σ , is involved
only in transcription initiation. The polymerase
comprised of all five subunits is called the core
enzyme.
d.
In prokaryotes the polymerase is composed of
five polypeptide subunits, two of which are
identical. Four of these subunits, denoted α , α
α, β , and β ’, comprise the polymerase core
enzyme. The fifth subunit, σ , is involved only
in termination. The polymerase comprised of all
five subunits is called the holoenzyme.
