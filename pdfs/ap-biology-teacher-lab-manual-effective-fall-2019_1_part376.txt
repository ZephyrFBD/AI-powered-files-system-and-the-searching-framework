e energy from the environment through 
photosynthesis and chemosynthesis, whereas heterotrophic organisms harvest free 
energy from carbon compounds produced by other organisms. In cellular respiration, 
free energy becomes available to drive metabolic pathways vital to cellular processes 
primarily by the conversion of ADP → ATP. In eukaryotes, respiration occurs in the 
mitochondria within cells. 
If sufficient oxygen is available, glucose may be oxidized completely in a series of 
enzyme-mediated steps, as summarized by the following reaction:
C6H12O6 + 6O2(g) → 6CO2(g) + 6H2O + energy
More specifically,
C6H12O6 + 6O2 (g) → 6CO2 (g) + 6H2O + 686 kilocalories of energy
mole of glucose oxidized
The chemical oxidation of glucose has important implications to the measurement 
of respiration. From the equation, if glucose is the energy source, then for every 
one molecule of oxygen consumed, one molecule of carbon dioxide is produced. To 
determine the rate of cellular respiration, one c
