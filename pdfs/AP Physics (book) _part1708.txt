 is contained in a tall cylindrical
jar of cross-sectional area 
fitted with an airtight
frictionless 0.15-kg movable piston. When the gas is 
heated (at constant pressure) from 25°C to 55°C, the
piston rises 1.0 cm. How much heat was required for this 
process? Assume atmospheric pressure outside. [Hint: See
Section 14–2.]

of
internal energy in the body. (a) In one day, how much fat
does the body burn to maintain the body temperature of a
person staying in bed and metabolizing at an average rate
of 95 W? (b) How long would it take to burn 1.0 kg of fat
this way assuming there is no food intake?

74. (a) At a steam power plant, steam engines work in pairs,
the heat output of the first one being the approximate heat
input of the second. The operating temperatures of the
first are 750°C and 440°C, and of the second 415°C and
270°C. I
