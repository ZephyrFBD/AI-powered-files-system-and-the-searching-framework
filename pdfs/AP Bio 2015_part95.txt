t spend time restating the questions or providing more than the number 
of examples called for. For instance, if a question calls for two examples, you can earn 
credit only for the first two examples that you provide. Labeled diagrams may be used to 
supplement discussion, but unless specifically called for by the question, a diagram alone 
will not receive credit. Write clearly and legibly. Begin each answer on a new page. Do not 
skip lines. Cross out any errors you make; crossed-out work will not be scored. 
Manage your time carefully. You may proceed freely from one question to the next. You 
may review your responses if you finish before the end of the exam is announced.
