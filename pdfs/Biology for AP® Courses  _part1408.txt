phenotype among the offspring: 3 (AA, Aa, aA) × 3 (BB,
bB, Bb)/16 = 9/16; 3 (AA, Aa, aA) × 1 (bb) /16 = 3/16; 1
(aa) × 3 (BB, bB, Bb) = 3/16; and 1 (aa) × 1 (bb) = 1/16.
A. Using the probability method, calculate the likelihood
of these phenotypes from each dihybrid cross:
•
recessive in the gene with alleles A and a from the
cross AaBb × aabb
•
dominant in both genes from the cross AaBb × aabb
•
recessive in both genes from the cross AaBb × aabb
•
recessive in either gene from the cross AaBb × aabb
A Punnett square representation of a trihybrid cross, such
as the self-cross of AaBbCc, is more cumbersome because
there are eight columns and rows (2×2×2 ways to choose
parental genotypes) and 64 cells. A less tedious
representation is to calculate the number of each type of
genotype in the offspring directly by counting the unique
permutations of the letters representing the alleles. For
example, the probability of the cross AaBbCc × AaBbCc
is 3 (AA, Aa, aA) × 3 (BB, Bb, bB) × 3 (CC, Cc
