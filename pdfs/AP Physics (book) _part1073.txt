by the wing (we are in the reference frame of the
wing, as if sitting on the wing). The upward tilt, as well as the rounded upper
surface of the wing, causes the streamlines to be forced upward and to be crowded
together above the wing. The area of air flowing between any two streamlines is
smaller as the streamlines get closer together, so from the equation of contin-
uity
the air speed increases above the wing where the streamlines
are squished together. (Recall also how the crowded streamlines in a pipe
constriction, Fig. 10–19, indicate the velocity is higher in the constriction.)
Thus the air speed is greater above the wing than below it, so the pressure above
the wing is less than the pressure below the wing (Bernoulli’s principle). Hence
there is a net upward force on the wing called dynamic lift. Experiments show
that the speed of air above the wing can even be double the speed of the air
below it. (Friction between the air and wing exerts a drag force, toward the rear,
