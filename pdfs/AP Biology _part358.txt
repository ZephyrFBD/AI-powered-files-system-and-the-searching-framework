y which a piece of DNA can be rapidly copied or amplified.
Billions of copies of a fragment of DNA can be produced in a few hours.
The DNA piece that is to be amplified is placed into a test tube with Taq
polymerase (a heat-stable form of DNA polymerase extracted from
extremophile bacteria), along with a supply of nucleotides (A, C, T, and
G) and primers necessary for DNA synthesis. Once the DNA is amplified,
these copies can be studied or used in a comparison with other DNA
samples.
The PCR technique has limitations:
Some information about the nucleotide sequence of the target DNA
must be known in advance in order to make the necessary primers.
The size of the piece that can be amplified must be very short.
Contamination is a major problem. If a few skin cells from the
technician who is working with the sample accidently contaminate
the sample, that could make obtaining accurate results difficult or
impossible. Such an error could have dire consequences with a
crime scene sample.
