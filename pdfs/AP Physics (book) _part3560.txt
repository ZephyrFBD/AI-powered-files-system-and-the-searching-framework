e the cyclotron.
APPROACH The frequency of the protons revolving within the dees (Eq. 32–2)
must equal the frequency of the voltage applied across the gap if the protons are
going to increase in speed.
SOLUTION (a) From Eq. 32–2,
which is in the radio-wave region of the EM spectrum (Fig. 22–8).
(b) The protons leave the cyclotron at 
From 
(see above), we have
so their kinetic energy is
NOTE The kinetic energy is much less than the rest energy of the proton
(938 MeV), so relativity is not needed.
NOTE The magnitude of the voltage applied to the dees does not appear in the
formula for 
, and so does not affect the final energy. But the higher this
voltage, the fewer the revolutions required to bring the protons to full energy.
