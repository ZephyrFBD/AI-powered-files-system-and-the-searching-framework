crystal. The second diffraction maximum is recorded when
the X-rays are directed at an angle of 21.2° relative to the
crystal surface. What is the spacing between crystal planes?
85. The Hubble Space Telescope, with an objective diameter of
2.4 m, is viewing the Moon. Estimate the minimum distance
between two objects on the Moon that the Hubble can
distinguish. Consider diffraction of light with wavelength
550 nm. Assume the Hubble is near the Earth.
