including the lungs, liver, and
digestive organs, and so on.
The mesoderm will give rise to the muscle, blood, and bones.
Some primitive animals (sponges and cnidarians) develop a
noncellular layer, the mesoglea, instead of the mesoderm. See
Figure 18.8.
Organogenesis is organ building. It is the process by which cells
continue to differentiate, producing organs from the three embryonic
germ layers. Three kinds of morphogenetic changes—folds, splits, and
dense clustering called condensation—are the first evidence of organ
building. Once all the organ systems have been developed, the embryo
