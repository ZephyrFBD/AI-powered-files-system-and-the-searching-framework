Design an Experiment 
715
Your professor gives you a bottle that contains a clear liquid. You 
are told that the liquid is a pure substance that is volatile, soluble in 
water, and might be an acid or a base. Design experiments to elu-
cidate the following about this unknown sample. (a) Determine 
whether the substance in the sample is an acid or a base. (b) Sup-
pose the substance is an acid. How would you determine whether 
it is a strong acid or a weak acid? (c) If the substance is a weak 
acid, how would you determine the value of Ka for the substance? 
 
(d) Suppose the substance were a weak acid and that you are also given 
a solution of NaOH(aq) of known molarity. What procedure would 
you use to isolate a pure sample of the sodium salt of the substance? 
 
(e) Now suppose that the substance were a base rather than an acid. 
How would you adjust the procedures in parts (b) and (c) to determine if 
the substance were a strong or weak base, and, if weak, the value of Kb?
