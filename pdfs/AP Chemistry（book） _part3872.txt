 substance with peptide bonds 
and asked to write its structural formula.
Plan The name of this substance suggests that three amino 
acids—alanine, glycine, and serine—have been linked together, 
forming a tripeptide. Note that the ending -yl has been added to 
each amino acid except for the last one, serine. By convention, the 
sequence of amino acids in peptides and proteins is written from 
the nitrogen end to the carbon end: The first-named amino acid 
(alanine, in this case) has a free amino group and the last-named 
one (serine) has a free carboxyl group.
Solve We first combine the carboxyl group of alanine with the 
amino group of glycine to form a peptide bond and then the 
carboxyl group of glycine with the amino group of serine to form 
another peptide bond:

We can abbreviate this tripeptide as either Ala-Gly-Ser or AGS.
