ore the half-life. The 
first-order rate constant is given by Equation 14.17:  
k = 0.693>t1>2 = 0.693>660 s = 1.05 * 10-3 s-1.
(b) The reaction proceeds much more rapidly in the presence of 
solid ZnO, so the surface of the oxide must be acting as a cat-
alyst for the decomposition of the acid. This is an example of 
heterogeneous catalysis.
(c) If we had graphed the concentration of formic acid in units of 
moles per liter, we would still have determined that the half-life 
for decomposition is 660 s, and we would have computed the 
same value for k. Because the units for k are s-1, the value for k is 
independent of the units used for concentration.
(d) According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, two moles of 
product are formed for each mole of reactant. When reaction 
is completed, therefore, the pressure will be 600 torr, just twice 
the initial pressure, assuming ideal-gas behavior. (Because we 
are working at quite high temperature and fairly low gas pres-
sure, assuming id
