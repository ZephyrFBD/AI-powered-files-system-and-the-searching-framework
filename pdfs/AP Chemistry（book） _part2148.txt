tements is true 
or false. (a) The freezing point of the solution is unchanged 
by addition of the solvent. (b) The solid that forms as the 
solution freezes is nearly pure solute. (c) The freezing point 
of the solution is independent of the concentration of the 
solute. (d) The boiling point of the solution increases in 
proportion to the concentration of the solute. (e) At any 
temperature, the vapor pressure of the solvent over the 
solution is lower than what it would be for the pure solvent.
 13.63  Consider two solutions, one formed by adding 10 g of glu-
cose 1C6H12O62 to 1 L of water and the other formed by 
adding 10 g of sucrose 1C12H22O112 to 1 L of water. Calcu-
late the vapor pressure for each solution at 20 °C; the vapor 
pressure of pure water at this temperature is 17.5 torr.
 13.64  The vapor pressure of pure water at 60 °C is 149 torr. The 
vapor pressure of water over a solution at 60 °C containing 
equal numbers of moles of water and ethylene glycol (a
