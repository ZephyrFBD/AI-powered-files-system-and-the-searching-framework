The initial and equilibrium concentrations 
of the species involved in this equilibrium 
are:

The equilibrium concentrations are gov-

x10.10 + x2
0.12 - x
Because Ka is small and a common ion is 
present, we expect x to be small relative to 
either 0.12 or 0.10 M. Thus, our equation 
can be simplified to give:
Ka = 1.4 * 10-4 =
x10.102
0.12
Solving for x gives a value that justifies our 
approximation:
 3H+4 = x = a 0.12
0.10 b11.4 * 10-42 = 1.7 * 10-4 M
Then, we can solve for pH:
 pH = -log11.7 * 10-42 = 3.77
Alternatively, we can use the Henderson–
Hasselbalch equation with the initial
