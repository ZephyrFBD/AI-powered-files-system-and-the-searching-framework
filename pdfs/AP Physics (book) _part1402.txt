Do holes expand or contract? If you heat a
thin, circular ring (Fig.13–10a) in the oven, does the ring’s hole get larger or smaller?
RESPONSE If you guessed that the metal expands into the hole, making the
hole smaller, it is not so. Imagine the ring is solid, like a coin (Fig. 13–10b).
Draw a circle on it with a pen as shown. When the metal expands, the material
inside the circle will expand along with the rest of the metal; so the dashed circle
expands. Cutting the metal where the circle is shows that the hole in Fig. 13–10a
increases in diameter.
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 13;4
Ring on a rod. An iron ring is to fit snugly on a cylindrical
iron rod (Fig. 13–11). At 20°C, the diameter of the rod is 6.445 cm and the inside
diameter of the ring is 6.420 cm. To slip over the rod, the ring must be slightly
larger than the rod diameter by about 0.008 cm. To what temperature must the ring
be brought if
