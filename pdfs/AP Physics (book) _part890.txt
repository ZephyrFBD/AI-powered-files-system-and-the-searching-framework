Assuming a uniform rate
of increase in angular velocity and a horizontal circular
path of radius 1.20 m, calculate (a) the angular acceleration,
(b) the (linear) tangential acceleration, (c) the centripetal
acceleration just before release, (d) the net force being
exerted on the hammer by the athlete just before release,
and (e) the angle of this force with respect to the radius of
the circular motion. Ignore gravity.
