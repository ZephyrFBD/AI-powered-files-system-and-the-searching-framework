ty, or mouth, is the point of entry of food into the digestive system, illustrated in Figure 25.9. The food
consumed is broken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth. All mammals have teeth and can
chew their food.
The extensive chemical process of digestion begins in the mouth. As food is being chewed, saliva, produced by the salivary
glands, mixes with the food. Saliva is a watery substance produced in the mouths of many animals. There are three major
glands that secrete salivaâ€”the parotid, the submandibular, and the sublingual. Saliva contains mucus that moistens food and
buffers the pH of the food. Saliva also contains immunoglobulins and lysozymes, which have antibacterial action to reduce
tooth decay by inhibiting growth of some bacteria. Saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the
process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose. Another enzyme called lipase is produced
by the cells in the to
