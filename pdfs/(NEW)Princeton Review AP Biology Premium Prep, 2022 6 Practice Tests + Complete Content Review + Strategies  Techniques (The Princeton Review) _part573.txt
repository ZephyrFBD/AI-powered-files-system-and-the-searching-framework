6. In this fictional scenario, an enzyme was discovered in reptile feces, gertimtonase, that was believed to aid in
digestion and water retention. Researchers wanted to know how the enzyme’s activity level changed with
varying temperature. The scientists took fecal samples of Russian tortoises that were living in varying
environmental temperatures. The data was summarized in the following graph.
(a) Describe how you can determine that tortoises raised at 34°C had the highest variability in enzyme reaction
rates.
(b) Reptiles in the study needed to have a gertimtonase reaction rate exceeding 10 mmol/s for an observed
improvement in water retention. Describe the range of temperatures that Russian tortoises could be raised
in to achieve this benefit.
(c) Desert tortoises live in environments where the ground temperature can exceed 60°C. Using the data above,
predict and justify how the graph would look for desert tortoise gertimtonase.
(d) Explain at a molecular level how
