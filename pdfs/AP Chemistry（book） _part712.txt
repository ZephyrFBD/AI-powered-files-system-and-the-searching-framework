by or on the system. Most commonly, the only kind of work produced by chemical or phys-
ical changes open to the atmosphere is the mechanical work associated with a change in 
volume. For example, when the reaction of zinc metal with hydrochloric acid solution
 
Zn1s2 + 2 H+1aq2 S Zn2 +1aq2 + H21g2 
[5.6]
is run at constant pressure in the apparatus illustrated in Figure 5.11, the piston moves up 
or down to maintain a constant pressure in the vessel. If we assume for simplicity that 
the piston has no mass, the pressure in the apparatus is the same as atmospheric pres-
sure. As the reaction proceeds, H2 gas forms, and the piston rises. The gas within the flask 
is thus doing work on the surroundings by lifting the piston against the force of atmo-
spheric pressure.
The work involved in the expansion or compression of gases is called pressure–
volume work (P–V work). When pressure
