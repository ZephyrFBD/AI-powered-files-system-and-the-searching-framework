SOLUTION
Analyze The standard enthalpy of formation is represented by a 
reaction in which each reactant is an element in its standard state 
and the product is one mole of the compound.
Plan We need to examine each equation to determine (1) whether 
the reaction is one in which one mole of substance is formed from 
the elements, and (2) whether the reactant elements are in their 
standard states.
Solve In (a) 1 mol Na2O is formed from the elements sodium and 
oxygen in their proper states, solid Na and O2 gas, respectively. 
Therefore, the enthalpy change for reaction (a) corresponds to a 
standard enthalpy of formation.
In (b) potassium is given as a liquid. It must be changed to the 
solid form, its standard state at room temperature. Furthermore, 
2 mol KCl are formed, so the enthalpy change for the reaction as 
written is twice the standard enthalpy o
