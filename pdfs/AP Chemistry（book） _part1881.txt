CHAPTER 12 Solids and Modern Materials
Each lithium atom contains a half-filled 2s orbital in its valence shell. The molecular- 
orbital diagram for Li2 is analogous to that of an H2 molecule: one filled bonding molecular 
orbital and one empty antibonding molecular orbital with a nodal plane between the atoms. 
 (Section 9.7) For Li4, there are four molecular orbitals, ranging from the lowest-energy 
orbital, where the orbital interactions are completely bonding (zero nodal planes), to the 
highest-energy orbital
