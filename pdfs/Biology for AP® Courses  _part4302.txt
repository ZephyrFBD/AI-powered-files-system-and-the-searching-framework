 fish
and other aquatic animals. The pH of water will
change, affecting metabolic processes as well.
53. What are some abiotic factors that affect freshwater
biomes? Explain.
a.
Salinity and sunlight are both abiotic factors that
influence life in freshwater biomes. As
organisms living in freshwater biomes require
high salt density for survival, its depletion would
kill the organisms. Many organisms that serve as
food for others are photosynthetic and would die
if algae blooms obscured the light. Their
decomposition as well as the depletion of
oxygen by algae would cause organisms that
require oxygen to die out as well.
b.
Salinity and sunlight are both abiotic factors that
influence life in freshwater biomes. As
organisms living in freshwater biomes cannot
tolerate high salt levels, these organisms would
not survive if it increased. Many organisms that
serve as food for others are photosynthetic
would die if algal blooms obscured the light.
