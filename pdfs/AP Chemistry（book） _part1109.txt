▶Practice Exercise 2
Write the electron configurations for (a) Ga3 +, (b) Cr3 +, 
and (c) Br-.
*Two sign conventions are used for electron affinity. In most introductory texts, including this 
one, the thermodynamic sign convention is used: A negative sign indicates that addition of an 
electron is an  
exothermic process, as in the electron affinity for chlorine, -349 kJ>mol. Histor-
ically, however, electron affinity has been defined as the energy released when an electron is 
added to a gaseous atom or ion.  
Because 349 kJ>mol is released when an electron is added to 
Cl(g), the electron affinity by this convention would be +349 kJ>mol.
The greater the attraction between an atom and an added electron, the more nega-
tive the atom’s electron affinity. For some elements, such as the noble gases, the electron
