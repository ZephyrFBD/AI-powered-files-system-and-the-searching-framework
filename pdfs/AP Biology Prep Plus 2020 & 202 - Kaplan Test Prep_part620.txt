 compaction,
researchers examined the eﬀects of radiation exposure on
condensed and decondensed chromatin. The figure below shows
the results from chromatin that was exposed to diﬀerent amounts
of radiation in Gray (Gy) units. The leȇ column for each dose
shows all DNA, whereas the right column shows only DNA that has
experienced double strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs indicate radiation
damage. The rows show DNA that was condensed, decondensed,
or previously decondensed and then later recondensed at the
time of irradiation.
Which of the following conclusions can most justifiably be drawn
from these results?

Compaction Protects Genomic DNA from Radiation
Damage,” PLoS ONE 8, no. 10 (October 2013): e75622.
Condensed DNA increasingly experienced damage due to
double strand breaks as radiation intensity increased, but
decondensed DNA was protected from this damage.

Decondensed DNA increasingly experienced damage due to
