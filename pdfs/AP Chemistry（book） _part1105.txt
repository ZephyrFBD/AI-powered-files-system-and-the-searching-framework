▶Practice Exercise 1
Consider the following statements about first ionization 
energies:
  (i) Because the effective nuclear charge for Mg is greater than 
that for Be, the ﬁrst ionization energy of Mg is greater than 
that of Be.
 (ii) The ﬁrst ionization energy of O is less than that of N be-
cause in O we must pair electrons in one of the 2p orbitals.
 
(iii) The ﬁrst ionization energy of Ar is less than that of Ne 
because a 3p electron in Ar is farther from the nucleus than 
a 2p electron in Ne.
Which of the statements (i), (ii), and (iii) is or are true?
(a) Only one of the statements is true.
(b) Statements (i) and (ii) are true.
(c) Statements (i) and (iii) are true.
(d) Statements (ii) and (iii) are true.
(e) All three statements are true.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2

Which has the highest?
