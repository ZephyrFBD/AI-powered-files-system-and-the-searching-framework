LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Explain how a change in 
the subunits of a polymer 
may lead to changes in 
structure or function of 
the macromolecule.
SYI-1.C
d. Proteins have primary structure determined 
by the sequence order of their constituent 
amino acids, secondary structure that arises 
through local folding of the amino acid 
chain into elements such as alpha-helices 
and beta-sheets, tertiary structure that is 
the overall three-dimensional shape of the 
protein and often minimizes free energy, 
and quaternary structure that arises from 
interactions between multiple polypeptide 
units. The four elements of protein structure 
determine the function of a protein. 
e. Carbohydrates comprise linear chains of 
sugar monomers connected by covalent 
bonds. Carbohydrate polymers may be linear 
or bran
