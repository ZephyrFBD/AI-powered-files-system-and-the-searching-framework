 can diffuse into the stratosphere. (a) Based on 
the data in Table 8.3, would you expect photodissociation 
of Br atoms to occur in the stratosphere? (b) Propose a 
mechanism by which the presence of halons in the strato-
sphere could lead to the depletion of stratospheric ozone.
 18.67  (a) What is the difference between a CFC and an HFC? 
 
(b) It is estimated that the lifetime for HFCs in the strato-
sphere is 2–7 years. Why is this number significant? 
 
(c)Why have HFCs been used to replace CFCs? (d) What is 
the major disadvantage of HFCs as replacements for CFCs?
 18.68  Explain, using Le Châtelier’s principle, why the equilib-
rium constant for the formation of NO from N2 and O2 
increases with increasing temperature, whereas the equilib-
rium constant for the formation of NO2 from NO and O2 
decreases with increasing temperature.
 18.69  Natural gas consists primarily of methane, CH41g2. 
(a) Write a balanced chemical equation for the complete 
combustion of methane to produc
