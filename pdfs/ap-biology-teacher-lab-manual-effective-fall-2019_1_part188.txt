lants®. First, you will 
identify and quantify several traits that vary in the population and that you can quantify 
easily. You will then perform artificial selection by cross-pollinating only selected plants. 
You’ll collect the seeds, plant them, and then sample the second-generation population 
and see if it is different from the previous one. Your results will generate questions, and 
you then will have a chance to test your own ideas about how selection works.
 Learning Objectives 
■
Bullet To investigate natural selection as a major mechanism of evolution
Bullet To convert a data set from a table of numbers that reflects a change in the genetic 
makeup of a population over time and to apply mathematical methods and 
conceptual understandings to investigate the cause(s) and effect(s) of this change
Bullet To apply mathematical methods to data from a real population to predict what will 
happen to the population in the future
Bullet To investigate how natural selection acts on phe
