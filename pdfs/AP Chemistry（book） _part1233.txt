cause lattice energy decreases as distance between ions increases, lattice energies 
follow trends that parallel those in ionic radius shown in Figure 7.8. In particular, because 
ionic radius increases as we go down a group of the periodic table, we find that, for a 
 
Sample Exercise 8.1
Magnitudes of Lattice Energies
Without consulting Table 8.1, arrange the ionic compounds NaF, CsI, and CaO in order of increasing lattice energy.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Without looking at Table 8.1, predict which one of the  
following orderings of lattice energy is correct for these  
ionic compounds. 
(a) NaCl 7 MgO 7 CsI 7 ScN (b) ScN 7 MgO 7 NaCl 7 CsI 
(c) NaCl 7 CsI 7 ScN 7 CaO  (d) MgO 7 NaCl 7 ScN 7 CsI 
(e) ScN 7 CsI 7 NaCl 7 MgO
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Which substance do you expect to have the greatest lattice  
energy: MgF2, CaF2, or ZrO2?
SOLUTION
Analyze From the formulas for three ionic compounds, we must 
determine their relative lattice energies.
Plan We need to determine the charges a
