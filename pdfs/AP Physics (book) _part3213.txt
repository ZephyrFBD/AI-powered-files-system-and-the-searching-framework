this innermost electron?
52. Protons are accelerated from rest across 480 V. They are
then directed at two slits 0.70 mm apart. How far apart will
the interference peaks be on a screen 28 m away?
53. How many electrons can there be in an “h” subshell?
54. (a) Show that the number of different states possible for a
given value of 
is equal to 
(b) What is this
number for
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6?
55. Show that the number of different electron states possible
for a given value of n is 
(See Problem 54.)
56. A beam of electrons with kinetic energy 45 keV is shot
through two narrow slits in a barrier. The slits are a dis-
tance 
apart. If a screen is placed 45.0 cm behind
the barrier, calculate the spacing between the “bright”
fringes of the interference pattern produced on the screen.
57. The angular momentum in the hydrogen atom is given
both by the Bohr model and by quantum mechanics.
Compare the results for 
58. The lifetime of a typical excited state in an atom is about
10 ns. Suppose an
