 could have a lower molality and still cause an increase of 
0.51  °C. The total molality of all the particles in the solution is 1 
m. page 548 The 0.20-m solution is hypotonic with respect to the 
0.5-m solution. (A hypotonic solution will have a lower concentra-
tion and hence a lower osmotic pressure.) page 550 They would 
have the same osmotic pressure because they have the same concen-
tration of particles. (Both are strong electrolytes that are 0.20 M in 
total ions.) page 553 No, hydrophobic groups would face outward 
to make contact with hydrophobic lipids.

page 570 Increasing the partial pressure increases the number of 
collisions between molecules. For any reaction that depends on  
collisions (which is nearly all of them), we would expect the rate
