eact to the environment.
Cnidarians, like the hydra and jellyfish, possess only the most primitive
and simplest forms of tissue.
As larger and more complex animals evolved, specialized cells joined
to form real tissues, organs, and organ systems. Flatworms have organs,
but no organ systems.
More complex animals, like annelids (segmented worms) and
arthropods, have organ systems.
Germ Layers
Germ layers are the main layers that form various tissues and organs of the
body. They are formed early in embryonic development as a result of
gastrulation. Complex animals are triploblastic. They consist of the
ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm.
The ectoderm, or outermost layer, becomes the skin and nervous
system, including the nerve cord and brain.
The endoderm, the innermost layer, becomes the viscera (guts) or
the digestive system.
The mesoderm, middle layer, becomes the blood and bones.
Primitive animals, like the Porifera and Cnidarians, have only two
cell layers and are called diploblastic.
