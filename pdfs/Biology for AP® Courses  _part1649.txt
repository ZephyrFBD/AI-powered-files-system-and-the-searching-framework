s very differently. RNA polymerase I is
completely insensitive to α-amanitin, meaning that the polymerase can transcribe DNA in vitro in the presence of this
poison. In contrast, RNA polymerase II is extremely sensitive to α-amanitin, and RNA polymerase III is moderately
sensitive. Knowing the transcribing polymerase can clue a researcher into the general function of the gene being studied.
Because RNA polymerase II transcribes the vast majority of genes, we will focus on this polymerase in our subsequent
discussions about eukaryotic transcription factors and promoters.
Structure of an RNA Polymerase II Promoter
Eukaryotic promoters are much larger and more complex than prokaryotic promoters, but both have a TATA box. For
example, in the mouse thymidine kinase gene, the TATA box is located at approximately -30 relative to the initiation (+1)
site (Figure 15.10). For this gene, the exact TATA box sequence is TATAAAA, as read in the 5' to 3' direction on the
nontemplate strand. This sequ
