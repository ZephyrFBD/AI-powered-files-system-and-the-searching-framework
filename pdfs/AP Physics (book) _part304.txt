camp in a direction 38.4Â° west of north. What are the compo-
nents of the displacement vector from camp to summit?
What is its magnitude? Choose the x axis east, y axis north,
and z axis up.
16. (III) You are given a vector in the xy plane that has a magni-
tude of 90.0 units and a y component of 
(a) What are the two possibilities for its x component?
(b) Assuming the x component is known to be positive,
specify the vector which, if you add it to the original one,
would give a resultant vector that is 80.0 units long and
points entirely in the 
direction.

17. (I) A tiger leaps horizontally from a 7.5-m-high rock with
a speed of 
How far from the base of the rock will
she land?
18. (I) A diver running 
dives out horizontally from the
edge of a vertical cliff and 3.0 s later reaches the water
below. How high was the cliff and how far from its base did
the diver hit the water?
