the blood, and chemoreceptors in the brain monitor the pH of the fluids surrounding the brain and spinal
cord (cerebrospinal fluid, CSF). When a body is active,
CO2 production increases. When the CO2 that enters the plasma and
 
CSF is converted to HCO3âˆ’ and H+, the pH drops (becomes more
acidic). In response, the chemoreceptors send nerve impulses to the diaphragm and intercostal muscles to increase
respiratory rate. This results in a faster turnover in gas exchange, which, in turn, returns blood
CO2 to normal. The regulation of the respiratory rate in this manner is an example of how homeostasis is maintained
by negative feedback.
The Circulatory System
Large organisms require a transport system to distribute nutrients and
 
oxygen and to remove wastes and CO2from cells distributed throughout
 
the body. Two kinds of circulatory systems accomplish this internal transport:
1. Open circulatory systems pump blood into an internal cavity called a hemocoel (or cavities called sinuses),
wh
