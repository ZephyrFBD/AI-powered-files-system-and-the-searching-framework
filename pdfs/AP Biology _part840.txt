LAB #9: BIOTECHNOLOGYâ€”RESTRICTION ENZYME
ANALYSIS OF DNA
Introduction
In this experiment, lambda DNA is incubated with two different restriction
enzymes and then run through an electrophoresis gel. Place the lambda
DNA into three test tubes. Incubate one sample with EcoRI, incubate
another sample with HINDIII, and leave one untreated as a control. The
two restriction enzymes will digest the DNA of two of the samples, cutting
them into characteristic pieces called restriction fragments. The three
samples should be placed into the wells on an agarose gel and drawn from
the cathode to the anode by electric current. After staining, a pattern
should result on the gel that reveals the restriction fragments. The control
sample of DNA should remain uncut and should be seen as a large block
of DNA near the well in lane 4. The two other samples were cut with
restriction enzymes, and the restriction fragment or banding
