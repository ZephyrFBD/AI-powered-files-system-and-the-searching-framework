FIGURE 19–16 Exercise E.
EXERCISE E If the jumper cables of Example 19–9 were mistakenly connected in reverse,
the positive terminal of each battery would be connected to the negative terminal of the
other battery (Fig. 19–16). What would be the current I even before the starter motor 
is engaged (the switch S in Fig. 19–16 is open)? Why could this cause the batteries to
explode?
Safety when Jump Starting
Before jump starting a car’s weak battery, be sure both batteries are 12 V and
check the polarity of both batteries. The following (cautious) procedure applies if
the negative 
terminal is ground (attached by a cable to the metal car frame
and motor), and the “hot” terminal is pos
