orated into the host cell genome. They are within group VI of the Baltimore classification scheme.
To convert RNA into DNA, retroviruses must contain genes that encode the virus-specific enzyme reverse transcriptase
that transcribes an RNA template to DNA. Reverse transcription never occurs in uninfected host cells—the needed enzyme
reverse transcriptase is only derived from the expression of viral genes within the infected host cells. The fact that some
retroviruses produces some of its own enzymes not found in the host has allowed researchers to develop drugs that
inhibit these enzymes. These drugs inhibit replication by reducing the activity of the enzyme without affecting the host’s
metabolism. This approach has led to the development of a variety of drugs used to treat these viruses and has been effective
at reducing the number of infectious virions (copies of viral RNA) in the blood to non-detectable levels in people affected
with the virus.
