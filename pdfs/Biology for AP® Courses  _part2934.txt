Small Intestine
Chyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine. The small intestine is the organ where the digestion of protein, fats,
and carbohydrates is completed. The small intestine is a long tube-like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger-
like projections called the villi. The apical surface of each villus has many microscopic projections called microvilli. These
structures, illustrated in Figure 25.12, are lined with epithelial cells on the luminal side and allow for the nutrients to be
absorbed from the digested food and absorbed into the blood stream on the other side. The villi and microvilli, with their
many folds, increase the surface area of the intestine and increase absorption efficiency of the nutrients. Absorbed nutrients
in the blood are carried into the hepatic portal vein, which leads to the liver. There, the liver regulates the distribution of
nutrients to the rest of the body and removes toxic s
