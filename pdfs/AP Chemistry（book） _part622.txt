small volume of dilute 
acid requires only a small amount of base to neutralize it.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
How many milligrams of sodium sulfide are needed to com-
pletely react with 25.00 mL of a 0.0100 M aqueous solution of 
cadmium nitrate, to form a precipitate of CdS(s)?  
(a) 13.8 mg (b) 19.5 mg (c) 23.5 mg (d) 32.1 mg (e) 39.0 mg
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
(a) How many grams of NaOH are needed to neutralize  
20.0 mL of 0.150 M H2SO4 solution? (b) How many liters  
of 0.500 M HCl(aq) are needed to react completely with  
0.100 mol of Pb1NO3221aq), forming a precipitate of PbCl21s)?
Thus, 2 mol HNO3 ] 1 mol Ca(OH22. Therefore,  Grams Ca1OH22 = 12.50 * 10-3 mol HNO32 * a
1 mol Ca1OH22
2 mol HNO3
b a
74.1 g Ca1OH22
1 mol Ca1OH22
b 
 = 0.0926 g Ca1OH22
