 isotope is particularly dangerous for human health.
 2.103  A U.S. 1-cent coin (a penny) has a diameter of 19 mm and a 
thickness of 1.5 mm. Assume the coin is made of pure copper, 
whose density and approximate market price are 8.9 g/cm3 
and $2.40 per pound, respectively. Calculate the value of 
the copper in the coin, assuming its thickness is uniform.
 2.104  The U.S. Mint produces a dollar coin called the American Sil-
ver Eagle that is made of nearly pure silver. This coin has a 
 
diameter of 41 mm and a thickness of 2.5 mm. The density 
and approximate market price of silver are 10.5 g/cm3 and 
$0.51 per gram, respectively. Calculate the value of the silver 
in the coin, assuming its thickness is uniform.
