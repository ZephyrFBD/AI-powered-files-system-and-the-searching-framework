ces by the local environment. It is true that increasing the environmental temperature generally increases reaction
rates, enzyme-catalyzed or otherwise. However, increasing or decreasing the temperature outside of an optimal range can
affect chemical bonds within the active site in such a way that they are less well suited to bind substrates. High temperatures
will eventually cause enzymes, like other biological molecules, to denature, a process that changes the natural properties
of a substance. Likewise, the pH of the local environment can also affect enzyme function. Active site amino acid residues
have their own acidic or basic properties that are optimal for catalysis. These residues are sensitive to changes in pH that
can impair the way substrate molecules bind. Enzymes are suited to function best within a certain pH range, and, as with
temperature, extreme pH values (acidic or basic) of the environment can cause enzymes to denature.
