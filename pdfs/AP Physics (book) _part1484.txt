10. (I) A concrete highway is built of slabs 12 m long (15°C).
How wide should the expansion cracks between the slabs be
(at 15°C) to prevent buckling if the range of temperature

11. (I) Super Invar™, an alloy of iron and nickel, is a strong
material with a very low coefficient of thermal expansion
A 1.8-m-long tabletop made of this alloy
is used for sensitive laser measurements where extremely
high tolerances are required. How much will this alloy table
expand along its length if the temperature increases 6.0 C°?
Compare to tabletops made of steel.
12. (II) To what temperature would you have to heat a brass
rod for it to be 1.5% longer than it is at 25°C?
