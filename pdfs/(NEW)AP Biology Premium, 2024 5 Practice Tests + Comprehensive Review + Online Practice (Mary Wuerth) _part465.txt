of a
population is greatly reduced for one or more generations. Natural disasters, like fires, floods, or volcanic eruptions,
can cause population bottlenecks. Human-made events, such as overhunting or rapid habitat destruction, can also
cause population bottlenecks. Because the population size is smaller after these bottlenecks, the surviving population
is much less likely to possess all of the alleles the larger population had before the bottleneck and thus will likely
have less genetic diversity. A model of the bottleneck effect is shown in Figure 20.1.
Figure 20.1 Model of the Bottleneck Effect
In Figure 20.1, each ball represents an allele in the population. In the original population, there are three different
types of alleles, represented as black, gray, and white balls. When the population experienced a bottleneck event,
none of the individuals that possessed the allele represented by the gray ball survived. Only two alleles, black and
white, survived the bottleneck, reducing t
