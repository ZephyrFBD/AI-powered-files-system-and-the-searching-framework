ation is relatively constant throughout the year
and ranges between 75 cm and 150 cm (29.5â€“59 in).
Because of the moderate annual rainfall and temperatures, deciduous trees are the dominant plant in this biome (Figure
35.18). Deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and remain leafless in the winter. Thus, no photosynthesis occurs in the
deciduous trees during the dormant winter period. Each spring, new leaves appear as the temperature increases. Because of
the dormant period, the net primary productivity of temperate forests is less than that of tropical wet forests. In addition,
temperate forests show less diversity of tree species than tropical wet forest biomes.

The trees of the temperate forests leaf out and shade much of the ground; however, this biome is more open than tropical
wet forests because trees in the temperate forests do no
