ecause silent mutations have no impact on amino acid
sequences in a protein, so there is no chance that they could lead to
improvements. (D) is incorrect because nonsense mutations add a
premature stop codon, which truncates proteins in a way that usually
renders them inoperable; thus, these mutations are less likely to result
in benefits.

In a codominant inheritance pattern, an organism will display both of
the traits if its genome includes both of the codominant alleles. Thus,
individuals with type AB blood will produce red blood cells with both A
and B antigens, (D). (A) is incorrect because each allele codes for an
antigen separately. There is no way to combine the characteristics of
both antigens into a single hybrid. (B) is incorrect because AB
individuals will display both A and B antigens on all red blood cells. (C)
is incorrect because it is safe to predict that all of the individualâ€™s red
blood cells will contain both antigens.
