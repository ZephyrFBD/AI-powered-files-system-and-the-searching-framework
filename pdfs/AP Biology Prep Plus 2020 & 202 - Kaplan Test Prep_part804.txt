s and responded to them
with increased vigilance and reduced resting behavior, as shown in the
table. A P-value less than 0.05 (meaning a less than 5% probability that
a diﬀerence is due to chance) is generally recognized as significant.
The table shows multiple P-values less than 0.05. In these cases,
researchers conclude that the lemurs behaved diﬀerently aȇer the
sound was played compared with before the sound was played. Thus,
(C) is the correct answer, and (A) and (B) are incorrect. (D) is incorrect
because none of the P-values for self-grooming  were less than 0.05
according to the table, suggesting that this behavior did not change
when vocalizations were played.
9. D
Learning Objective: 18.1
The songs appear to be very similar in the “No Tutor” and
“Heterospecific Tutor” birds, so eliminate (A) and (C), which state that
the songs appear diﬀerent. The similarity in song, regardless of the
experimental conditions tested, suggests that the song is innate rather
than learned from e
