aring bodies of many fungi. Spores are then
released, which repeat the cycle when they germinate under improved environmental conditions. In some species,
the signaling molecule that stimulates aggregation is cyclic AMP (cAMP), which is secreted by the individual cells
that experience food deprivation first.
Kingdom Fungi
Fungi grow as filaments called hyphae (singular, hypha). A mass of hyphae is called mycelium (plural, mycelia).
Some fungi have septa (singular, septum), or cross walls, which divide the filament into compartments containing a
single nucleus. The cell walls of fungi consist of chitin, a nitrogen-containing polysaccharide.
Most fungi are either parasites or decomposers, absorbing the breakdown products from the action of digestive
enzymes that they secrete. Other fungi, such as those in the following two groups, form mutualistic arrangementsâ€”
relationships where two organisms, living together, contribute to the survival of each other:
