d. For example, a skin cell expressing higher levels of the melanin protein would
appear darker in color than a skin cell expressing lower levels of the melanin protein.
The timing of the expression of different transcription factors during development is critical to the formation of
specialized tissues and organs from a single-celled zygote. Errors in the timing of the expression of these genes can
result in errors in the body plan or structures of an organism. A family of genes that codes for transcription factors
called the Hox genes were discovered in Drosophila flies. The Hox gene coding for antennapedia controls the
formation of legs in Drosophila during development. Mutations in this gene or expression of this gene at the wrong
time can result in legs not forming or legs being located in the wrong body segment.
Mutations
Mutations are changes in the genetic material of an organism. Mutations may result in changes to the organismâ€™s
phenotype. Phenotypes can change if the mutation
