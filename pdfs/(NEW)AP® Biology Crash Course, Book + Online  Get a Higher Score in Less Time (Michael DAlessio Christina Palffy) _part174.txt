13. Which of the following fills in the table correctly for the dimensions of the cube?
(A) A=7, B=150, C=294, D=125, E=6:5, F=2:7
(B) A=9, B=150, C=729, D=125, E=6:5, F=2:3
(C) A=9, B=50, C=486, D=150, E=8:5, F=3:2
(D) A=8, B=50, C=294, D=175, E=4:3, F=2:6
14. Into which cell would oxygen diffuse more efficiently?
(A) Cell 1 because it has a larger surface area-to-volume ratio.
(B) Cell 2 because it has a larger volume, so there is more energy for diffusion.
(C) Cell 2 because it has a larger surface area and thus contains more protein pumps for oxygen
transport.
(D) The oxygen diffusion efficiency is the same for both cells, since oxygen is such an important
