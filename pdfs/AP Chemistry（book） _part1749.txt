t a constant temperature of 0 °C.
t Line CD: Heating increases the temperature of the H2O( l ) 
from 0 °C to 100 °C.
t Line DE: Heating converts H2O( l ) to H2O( g) as the water 
boils at a constant temperature of 100 °C.
t Line EF: Heating increases the temperature of the H2O( g)  
to 125 °C.
We can calculate the enthalpy change of the system for 
each region of the heating curve. Lines AB, CD, and EF show 
the heating of a single phase from one temperature to another. 
As we saw in Section 5.5, the amount of heat needed to raise 
the temperature of a substance is given by the product of the 
specific heat, mass, and temperature change (Equation 5.21). 
The greater the specific heat of a substance, the more heat we 
must add to accomplish a certain temperature increase. Because 
the specific heat of water is greater than that of ice, the slope of 
line CD is less than that of line AB. This lesser slope means the 
amount of heat we must add to a given mass of liquid water to
