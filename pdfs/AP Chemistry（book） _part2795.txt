a sample by what were called wet chemical methods. For example, an ore sample that 
might contain several metallic elements was dissolved in a concentrated acid solution 
that was then tested in a systematic way for the presence of various metal ions.
Qualitative analysis determines only the presence or absence of a particular 
metal ion relative to some threshold, whereas quantitative analysis determines 
how much of a given substance is present. Even though wet methods of qualitative 
analysis have become less important in the chemical industry, they are frequently
