NaHCO31aq2 + HCl1aq2 ¡ NaCl1aq2 + CO21g2 + H2O1l2
H2CO3, a weak acid, forms and decomposes to carbon dioxide and wa-
ter. page 741 AgCl. Because all three compounds produce the same 
number of ions, their relative stabilities correspond directly to the Ksp 
values, with the compound with the largest Ksp value being the most 
soluble. page 755 Silver, because AgCl is relatively insoluble.

page 769 We would expect that helium is relatively more abundant 
at the higher elevation, because Earth’s gravitational field would 
exert a greater downward force on the heavier argon atoms. As a 
result the helium to argon ratio would be higher in the mesosphere 
than in the troposphere. page 772 Photoionization causes an 
electron to be ejected from an atom or molecule leading to the for-
mation of a cation. It does not generally result in the breaking of a 
bond. page 774 From their Lewis structures we predict bond o
