a.
Group I and VI viruses use RNA as their
genome. Group I viruses reproduce by
transcribing RNA from their DNA genome,
while Group VI viruses first synthesize their
RNA genome using reverse transcriptase before
they can reproduce.
b.
Group I and VI viruses use DNA as their
genome. Group I viruses reproduce by
transcribing RNA from their DNA genome
while group VI viruses first synthesize their
DNA genome using reverse transcriptase before
they can reproduce.
c.
Group I and VI viruses use DNA as their
genome. Group I viruses reproduce by
transcribing RNA from their DNA genome,
while group VI viruses first synthesize RNA
