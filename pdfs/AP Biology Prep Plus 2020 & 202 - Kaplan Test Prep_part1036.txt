tter X represents ATP, whose production is an essential aspect of the entire cellular
respiration process. (C) is correct. (A) is incorrect because glucose is broken down to two
pyruvate molecules before entering a mitochondrion for aerobic respiration. (B) is
incorrect because NADP+ is used in photosynthesis, not respiration. (D) is incorrect
because ADP is a precursor to ATP.

By definition, asexual reproduction is the production of oﬀspring genetically identical to
the single parent, primarily occurring via binary fission. Sexual reproduction involves
fusion of unique haploid gametes to produce genetically unique diploid oﬀspring. Self-
pollination is a form of sexual reproduction. A single parent plant produces both male
and female gametes, but each is the product of meiosis and genetically unique. Fusion of
two gametes produces a unique diploid zygote, which will develop into a unique adult.
(D) is correct. (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because self-pollination is not a for
