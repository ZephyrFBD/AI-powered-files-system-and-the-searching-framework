ontains 118 neutrons, (b) the isotope of krypton with 
mass number 84, (c) the isotope of arsenic with mass num-
ber 75, (d) the isotope of magnesium that has an equal num-
ber of protons and neutrons.
 2.32  One way in which Earthâ€™s evolution as a planet can be under-
stood is by measuring the amounts of certain isotopes in 
rocks. One quantity recently measured is the ratio of 129Xe 
to 130Xe in some minerals. In what way do these two isotopes 
differ from one another? In what respects are they the same?
 2.33 (a) What isotope is used as the standard in establishing the 
atomic mass scale? (b) The atomic weight of boron is re-
ported as 10.81, yet no atom of boron has the mass of 10.81 
amu. Explain.
 2.34  (a) What is the mass in amu of a carbon-12 atom? (b) Why is 
the atomic weight of carbon reported as 12.011 in the table of 
elements and the periodic table in the front inside cover of 
this text?
 2.35 Only two isotopes of copper occur naturally: 63Cu (atomic 
mass = 62.9296 amu
