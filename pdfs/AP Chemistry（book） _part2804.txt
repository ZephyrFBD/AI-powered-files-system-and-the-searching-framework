is reason, it is important to choose 
an indicator whose color change is near the pH at the equivalence 
point for titrations involving either weak acids or weak bases. It 
is possible to calculate the pH at any point of the titration curve 
by first considering the effects of the acidâ€“base reaction on solu-
tion concentrations and then examining equilibria involving the 
remaining solute species.
SOLUBILITY EQUILIBRIA (SECTION 17.4) The equilibrium 
between a solid compound and its ions in solution provides an 
example of heterogeneous equilibrium. The solubility-product 
constant (or simply the solubility product), Ksp, is an equilibrium 
constant that expresses quantitatively the extent to which the 
compound dissolves. The Ksp can be used to calculate the solubil-
ity of an ionic compound, and the solubility can be used to calcu-
late Ksp.
FACTORS THAT AFFECT SOLUBILITY (SECTION 17.5) Several 
experimental factors, including temperature, affect the solubili-
ties of ionic compounds
