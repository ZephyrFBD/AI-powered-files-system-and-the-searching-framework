(iii) has 
an expanded octet. As drawn, the central Cl atom in anion (i) also 
has an expanded octet. Note that multiple resonance structures for 
ClO4
-
 can be drawn, including one where Cl obeys the octet rule. The 
structure shown in this exercise is one that minimizes formal charge.

C. (b) three transition states (c) C ¡ D is fastest. (d) ∆E is positive. 
 
14.71 (a) H21g2 + 2 ICl1g2 S I21g2 + 2 HCl1g2 (b) HI is the intermedi-
ate. (c) If the ﬁrst step is slow, the observed rate law is rate = k3H243ICI4. 
14.73 (a) The two-step mechanism is consistent with the data, assum-
ing that the second step is rate determining. (b) No. The linear plot 
guarantees that the overall rate law will include 3NO42. Since the data 
were obtained at constant 3Cl24, we have no information about reac-
tion order with respect to 3Cl24. 14.75 (a) A catalyst is a substance 
that changes (usually increases) the speed of a chemical reaction 
without undergoing a perma
