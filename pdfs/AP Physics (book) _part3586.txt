ough charge, energy, and so on, are conserved (
means the reaction
does not occur). To understand why such a reaction does not occur, physicists
hypothesized a new conservation law, the conservation of baryon number.
(Baryon number is a generalization of nucleon number, which we saw earlier is
conserved in nuclear reactions and decays.) All nucleons are defined to have
baryon number 
and all antinucleons (antiprotons, antineutrons) have
