 Works shoveling coal and coke into the furnaces. Gassed 
 
 in France and back to Limerick to work in the gas works.When you 
 
 grow up you’ll laugh. 
 
 Malachy and I have to leave the table so the big people can sit and 
 
  
  
 have tea.They have their tea but Uncle Pa Keating, who is my uncle 
 
 because he’s married to my aunt Aggie, picks up Eugene and takes him 
 
 72 
 
 on his lap. He says, This is a sad little fella, and makes funny faces and 
 
 silly sounds. Malachy and I laugh but Eugene only reaches up to touch 
 
 the blackness of Pa Keating’s skin, and then when Pa pretends to bite his 
 
 little hand, Eugene laughs and everyone in the room laughs. Malachy 
 
 goes to Eugene and tries to make him laugh even more but Eugene 
 
 turns away and hides his face in Pa Keating’s shirt. 
 
 I think he likes me, says Pa, and that’s when Aunt Aggie puts down 
 
 her teacup and starts to bawl,Waah,waah,waah, big teardrops tumbling 
 
 down her fat red face. 
 
 Aw, Jesus, says
