e domain of life and how these
shared, conserved core processes and features support the concept of common ancestry for
all organisms.
Microfilaments
If you were to remove all the organelles from a cell, would the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm be the only components
left? No. Within the cytoplasm, there would still be ions and organic molecules, plus a network of protein fibers that help
maintain the shape of the cell, secure some organelles in specific positions, allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within
the cell, and enable cells within multicellular organisms to move. Collectively, this network of protein fibers is known
as the cytoskeleton. There are three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and
microtubules (Figure 4.22). Here, we will examine each.
