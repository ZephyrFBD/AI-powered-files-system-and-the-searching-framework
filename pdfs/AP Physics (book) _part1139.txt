At the atomic level, atoms oscillate within a
molecule, and the atoms of a solid oscillate about their relatively fixed positions.
Because it is so common in everyday life and occurs in so many areas of physics,
oscillatory (or vibrational) motion is of great importance. Mechanical oscillations
or vibrations are fully described on the basis of Newtonian mechanics.
Vibrations and wave motion are intimately related. Waves—whether ocean
waves, waves on a string, earthquake waves, or sound waves in air—have as their
source a vibration. In the case of sound, not only is the source a vibrating object,
but so is the detector—the eardrum or the membrane of a microphone. Indeed,
when a wave travels through a medium, the medium oscillates (such as air for
sound waves). In the second half of this Chapter, after we discuss oscillations, we
will discuss simple waves such as those on water or on a string. In Chapter 12 
we will study sound waves, and in later Chapters we will encounter other forms
