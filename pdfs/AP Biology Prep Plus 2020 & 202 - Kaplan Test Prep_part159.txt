ter into it. The more negative the water
potential, the stronger its pulling force.
Dialysis bags allow for the movement of water but not ions. A common
osmosis experiment is to fill dialysis bags with diﬀerent solutions. These
bags are tied at each end and put into hypertonic, hypotonic, and
isotonic solutions. The water will move in the direction of the hypertonic
solution. Suppose you tied your dialysis bags and put them in solutions
to complete the experiment but didn’t get the results you expected.
Skewed results can be obtained by not tying the knot on your bag tight
enough, not getting all the solution washed oﬀ the outside of your bag, or
by some other slight oversight. Oȇen, one group gets usable results for
one part of the lab and another group gets another part right, so
everyone shares the “good” results. Occasionally, classes have really
good luck and all the groups get “good” results. Either way, you need to
know what happened in order to score well on the exam. You can e
