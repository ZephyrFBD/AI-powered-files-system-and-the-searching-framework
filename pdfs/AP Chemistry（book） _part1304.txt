quires 8 * 4 = 32 electrons.
We are thus left with 36 - 32 = 4 electrons to be placed on the 
larger iodine:

Iodine has 12 valence electrons around it, four more than needed 
for an octet.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
In which of these molecules or ions is there only one lone pair 
of electrons on the central sulfur atom?

▶Practice Exercise 2
(a) Which of the following atoms is never found with more 
than an octet of valence electrons around it? S, C, P
, Br, I.  
(b) Draw the Lewis structure for XeF2.

Finally, there are Lewis structures where you might have to choose between satisfying 
the octet rule and obtaining the most favorable formal charges by using more than an octet 
of electrons. For example, consider these Lewis structures for the phosphate ion, PO4
