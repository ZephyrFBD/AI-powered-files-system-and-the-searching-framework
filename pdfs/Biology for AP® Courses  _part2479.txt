 and is returned to the atmosphere via the respiration of chemoorganotrophic organisms, including
prokaryotes, fungi, and animals. Although the largest carbon reservoir in terrestrial ecosystems is in rocks and sediments,

that carbon is not readily available.
A large amount of available carbon is found in land plants. Plants, which are producers, use carbon dioxide from the air
to synthesize carbon compounds. Related to this, one very significant source of carbon compounds is humus, which is
a mixture of organic materials from dead plants and prokaryotes that have resisted decomposition. Consumers such as
animals use organic compounds generated by producers and release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Then, bacteria and
fungi, collectively called decomposers, carry out the breakdown (decomposition) of plants and animals and their organic
compounds. The most important contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is microbial decompo
