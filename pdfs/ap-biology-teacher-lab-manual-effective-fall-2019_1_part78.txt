ticular lab in AP Biology will 
be completely student directed. However, as written, the labs lead to a student-directed, 
inquiry-based investigation(s). As a reminder, the levels of inquiry are as follows: 
•  Confirmation: Students confirm a principle through an activity in which the results 
are known in advance. 
•  Structured: Students investigate a teacher-presented question through a prescribed 
procedure. 
•  Guided: Students investigate a teacher-presented question using student-designed/ 
selected procedures. 
•  Open Inquiry: Students investigate topic-related questions that are formulated 
through student-designed/selected procedures. 
The following table indicates whether the lab questions, procedures, and solutions are 
teacher provided or student generated for each level of inquiry.
