11.25 are 
graphed as ln P versus 1>T in Figure 11.26. The data lie on a straight 
line with a negative slope. We can use the slope to determine ∆Hvap 
for ethanol, 38.56 kJ>mol. We can also extrapolate the line to obtain 
the vapor pressure of ethanol at temperatures above and below the 
temperature range for which we have data.

Relating Boiling Point to Vapor Pressure
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to read a graph of vapor pressure versus 
temperature to determine the boiling point of a substance at a par-
ticular pressure. The boiling point is the temperature at which the 
vapor pressure is equal to
