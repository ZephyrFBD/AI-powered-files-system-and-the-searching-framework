If the amount of H2 is doubled, how many moles of H2O would 
have formed?
 
SECTION 3.7   
Limiting Reactants

The second line in the table (Change) summarizes the amounts of reactants con-
sumed (where this consumption is indicated by the minus signs) and the amount of the 
product formed (indicated by the plus sign). These quantities are restricted by the quan-
tity of the limiting reactant and depend on the coefficients in the balanced equation. 
The mole ratio H2:O2:H2O = 10:5:10 is a multiple of the ratio of the coefficients in the 
balanced equation, 2:1:2. The after quantities, which depend on the before quantities 
and their changes, are found by adding the before quantity and change quantity for each 
column. The amount of the limiting reactant 1H22 must be zero at the end of the reac-
tion. What remains is 2 mol O2 (excess reactant) and 10 mol H2O (product).
