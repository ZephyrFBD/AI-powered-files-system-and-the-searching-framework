ctions would not be produced. Thus, the light-independent reactions would stop when their supply of
ATP and NADPH was depleted.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) Chlorophyll a will absorb the most violet light because its peak absorbance is at approximately 425 nm,
which is in the range for violet. Chlorophyll b will absorb the most blue light because its peak absorbance is
at approximately 480 nm, which is in the range for blue. The carotenoids absorb the most green light
because their peak absorbance is at approximately 510 nm, which is in the range for green.
(b) An appropriate control would be a plant without the mutation that could produce chlorophyll a, chlorophyll
b, and carotenoids. The independent variable would be the presence or absence of chlorophyll a and
chlorophyll b. The dependent variable would be the rate of photosynthesis.
(c) Rate of photosynthesis in the control plants = 400 microliters oxygen/30 minutes = 13.3 microliters
oxygen/minute
