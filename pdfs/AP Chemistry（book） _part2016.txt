wear. The product is said to be superior to cotton or 
polyester clothing in wicking moisture away from the 
body through the fabric to the outside. Explain the 
difference between polypropylene and polyester or cot-
ton (which has many ¬OH groups along the molecu-
lar chain) in terms of intermolecular interactions with 
water.

(a) In polyvinyl chloride shown in Table 12.6, which 
bonds have the lowest average bond enthalpy? 
 
(b) When subjected to high pressure and heated, poly-
vinyl chloride converts to diamond. During this trans-
formation which bonds are most likely to break first? (c) 
Employing the values of average bond enthalpy in Table 
8.3, estimate the overall enthalpy change for converting 
PVC to diamond.
 
[12.130]  Silicon has the diamond structure with a unit cell edge 
length of 5.43 Å and eight atoms per unit cell. (a) How 
many silicon atoms are there in 1 cm3 of material? (b) Sup-
pose you dope that 1 cm3 sample of silicon with 1 ppm of 
phosphorus
