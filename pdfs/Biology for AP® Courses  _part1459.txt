r of chromosomes for their species
process by which homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal physical exchanges at
their arms, also known as crossing over
photographic image of a karyotype
number and appearance of an individuals chromosomes; includes the size, banding patterns, and centromere
position
otherwise diploid genotype in which one chromosome is missing
failure of synapsed homologs to completely separate and migrate to separate poles during the first cell
division of meiosis
progeny resulting from homologous recombination that exhibits a different allele
combination compared with its parents
inversion that occurs outside of the centromere
progeny that exhibits the same allelic combination as its parents
inversion that involves the centromere
individual with an incorrect number of chromosome sets
average number of crossovers between two alleles; observed as the number of nonparental
types in a population of progeny
process by which one segment of a chromosome dissociates and r
