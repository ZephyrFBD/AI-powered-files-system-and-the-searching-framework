Figure 15.3 Because the concentration of reactants is decreasing, 
which reduces the frequency of collisions and hence the rate of the 
forward reaction. Figure 15.4 Yes. The reaction stoichiometry 
dictates that H2 disappears at three times the rate that N2 disap-
pears. Figure 15.6 Experiment 4 Figure 15.7 The boxes would 
be approximately the same size. Figure 15.8 It would decrease. 
To reestablish equilibrium the concentration of CO21g2 would need 
to return to its previous value. The only way to do that would be for 
more CaCO3 to decompose to produce enough CO21g2 to replace 
what was lost. Figure 15.10 High pressure and low tempera-
ture, 500 atm and 400 °C in this figure. Figure 15.11 Nitrogen 
must react with some of the added hydrogen to create ammonia 
and restore equilibrium. Figure 15.16 (a) the energy difference 
between the initial state and the transition state.
