e shape of the
enzyme’s reactive site matches the shape of the substrate molecule.
i.
When the enzyme and substrate are joined, a catalytic reaction takes place, forming a product. The
enzyme can be recycled and used for later reactions.
ii. Enzymes are affected by pH, temperature, and substrate concentration. Enzymes have a pH and
temperature optima at which enzyme activity is greatest. Also, as a substrate’s concentration
increases, the speed at which the reaction occurs increases up to a maximum level at which all
enzyme molecules are processing substrate molecules as fast as possible.
iii. Cofactors and coenzymes can also affect enzyme function. Sometimes the interaction between
them causes a structural change, and therefore the enzyme’s activity rate changes. Enzymes may
also become active only when all necessary coenzymes and cofactors are present. Most coenzymes
are vitamins and cofactors are often minerals.
