The Laws of Thermodynamics
Car efficiency. An automobile engine has an efficiency of
20% and produces an average of 23,000 J of mechanical work per second during
operation. (a) How much heat input is required, and (b) how much heat is
discharged as waste heat from this engine, per second?
APPROACH We want to find the heat input 
as well as the heat output 
given
each second and an efficiency
We can use the def-
inition of efficiency, Eq. 15–4 in its various forms, to find first 
and then 
SOLUTION (a) From Eq. 15–4a,
we solve for 
The engine requires
of heat input.
(b) Now we use Eq. 15–4b
and solve for 
so
The engine discharges heat to the environment at a rate of
NOTE Of the 115 kJ that enters the engine per second, only 23 kJ (20%) does
useful work whereas 92 kJ (80%) is wasted as heat output.
NOTE The problem was stated in terms of energy per unit time. We could just
as we
