SOLUTION
Analyze Our task is to predict several properties of the cation O2
+.
Plan We will use the MO description of O2
+ to determine the de-
sired properties. We must first determine the number of electrons 
in O2
+ and then draw its MO energy diagram. The unpaired elec-
trons are those without a partner of opposite spin. The bond order 
is one-half the difference between the number of bonding and an-
tibonding electrons. After cal
