Figure A.1 
This is the kind of picture graph that you often see in newspapers. This information can 
be presented much more simply on a graph — a line graph is permissible — because our 
experience tells us that when A is disappearing in a chemical reaction, it is disappearing 
more or less smoothly and will not suddenly reappear. In other words, the progress of a 
chemical reaction is a continuous process, and because time is a continuous process it 
is permissible to relate the two kinds of information to one another on a line graph. The 
procedure for constructing the line graph is shown in Figure A.2.

It should be clear from the diagram that each point corresponds both to a particular
