times that of the smallest,

Nuclear and atomic densities. Compare the
density of nuclear matter to the density of normal solids.
APPROACH The density of normal liquids and solids is on the order of 
to
(see Table 10–1), and because the atoms are close packed, atoms have
about this density too. We therefore compare the density (mass per volume) of
a nucleus to that of its atom as a whole.
SOLUTION The mass of a proton is greater than the mass of an electron by a factor
Thus, over 99.9% of the mass of an atom is in the nucleus, and for our estimate we
can say the mass of the atom equals the mass of the nucleus,
Atoms have a radius of about 
(Chapter 27) and nuclei on the order of
(Eq. 30–1). Thus the ratio of nuclear density to atomic density is about
The nucleus is 
times more dense than ordinary matter.
The masses of nuclei can be determi
