 effect of this mutation?
(A) No transcription and no translation of Fursilla will occur.
(B) Transcription will not occur, but translation will be unaffected.
(C) Transcription of Fursilla will occur, but no translation will occur.
(D) Both transcription and translation of Fursilla will be unaffected.
13. Which of the following would likely produce a dog with the darkest fur?
(A) High levels of LSFR and high levels of DRKFR
(B) High levels of LSFR and low levels of DRKFR
(C) Low levels of LSFR and high levels of DRKFR
(D) Low levels of LSFR and low levels of DRKFR
14. Based on the data, which of the following most likely describes how the binding of proteins affects the
production of Fursilla transcript?
(A) Because Fursilla transcript levels change when certain proteins are overexpressed or unexpressed in the
cell, Fursilla must interfere with the other proteins.
(B) Because Fursilla transcript levels stay the same whether NEFR is overexpressed or unexpressed, NEFR
must bind inhibit
