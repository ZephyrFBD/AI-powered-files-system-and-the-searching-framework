cist’. BLM and its Cult masters don’t
want to end racism. To them it’s a means to an end to control all of
humanity never mind the colour, creed, culture or background.
What has destroying the nuclear family got to do with ending
racism? Nothing – but that is one of the goals of BLM and also
happens to be a goal of the Cult as I have been exposing in my books
for decades. Stealing children from loving parents and giving
schools ever more power to override parents is part of that same
agenda. BLM is a Marxist organisation and why would that not be
the case when the Cult created Marxism and BLM? Patrisse Cullors, a
BLM co-founder, said in a 2015 video that she and her fellow
organisers, including co-founder Alicia Garza, are ‘trained Marxists’.
The lady known aĞer marriage as Patrisse Khan-Cullors bought a
$1.4 million home in 2021 in one of the whitest areas of California
with a black population of just 1.6 per cent and has so far bought four
high-end homes for a total of $3.2 million.
