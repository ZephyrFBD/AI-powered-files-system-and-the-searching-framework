ntist who studied them extensively in the 
early nineteenth century. Altogether, about 25,000 lines have 
been identiﬁed in the solar spectrum between 2950 Å and 
10,000 Å. The Fraunhofer lines are attributed to absorption 
of certain wavelengths of the Sun’s “white” light by gaseous 
elements in the Sun’s atmosphere. (a) Describe the process 
that causes absorption of speciﬁc wavelengths of light from 
the solar spectrum. (b) To determine which Fraunhofer lines 
belong to a given element, say, neon, what  
experiments could 
a scientist conduct here on Earth?
 6.93  Determine whether each of the following sets of quantum num-
bers for the hydrogen atom are valid. If a set is not valid, indicate 
which of the quantum numbers has a value that is not valid:
 
 (a) n = 4, l = 1, ml = 2, ms = -1

 (b)  n = 4, l = 3, ml = -3, ms = +1

 (c) n = 3, l = 2, ml = -1, ms = +1

 (d)  n = 5, l = 0, ml = 0, ms = 0
 
 (e) n = 2, l = 2, ml = 1, ms = +1
