Water moves up a tall tree from the roots to the leaves without
the expenditure of energy by what is referred to as
transpirational-pull cohesion tension. As one molecule of
water is lost from the leaf by transpiration, another molecule is
drawn in at the roots.

Capillary action results from the combined forces of cohesion
and adhesion, attraction of unlike substances.
Surface tension allows insects to walk on water without
breaking the surface.
ICE IS LESS DENSE THAN WATER. In a deep body of water, floating ice
insulates the liquid water below it, allowing fish and other
organisms to survive beneath the frozen surface during winter. In
the spring, the ice melts, becomes denser, and sinks to the bottom of
the lake, causing water to circulate throughout the lake. Oxygen
from the surface is returned to the depths, and nutrients released by
the activities of bottom-dwelling bacteria during winter are carried
to the upper layers of t
