a.
ATP dissociates and the energy released by
breaking of a phosphate bond within ATP is used
for phosphorylation of another molecule. ATP
hydrolysis also provides energy to power
coupling reactions.
b.
ATP utilizes energy to power exergonic reactions
by hydrolysis of ATP molecule. The free energy
released as a result of ATP breakdown is used to
carry out metabolism of products.
c.
ATP utilizes energy to power endergonic
reactions by dehydration of ATP molecule. The
free energy released as a result of ATP
breakdown is used to carry out metabolism of
products.
d.
ATP utilizes the energy released from the
coupling reactions and that energy is used to
power the endergonic and exergonic reactions.
