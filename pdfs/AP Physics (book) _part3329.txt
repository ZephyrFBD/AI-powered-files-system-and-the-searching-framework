year). The
squares contain the atomic mass of that isotope, or
half-life and energy released if radioactive. Other
details may be alternate decay modes and certain
cross sections ( ).

n the early part of the twentieth century, Rutherford’s experiments 
(Section 27–10) led to the idea that at the center of an atom there is a tiny
but massive nucleus with a positive charge. At the same time that the quantum
theory was being developed and scientists were attempting to understand the
structure of the atom and its electrons, investigations into the nucleus itself had
also begun. In this Chapter and the next, we take a brief look at nuclear physics.
