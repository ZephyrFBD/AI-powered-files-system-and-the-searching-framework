is doing work on the surroundings, so w 6 0. Figure 5.11 The 
system does work on the surroundings to move the piston upward, 
so w 6 0. Figure 5.17 Endothermic—heat is being added to the 
system to raise the temperature of the water. Figure 5.18 Two 
cups provide more thermal insulation so less heat will escape the 
system. Figure 5.19 In a calorimeter the system is deﬁned as the 
reactants and products, so the water inside the calorimeter is part of 
the surroundings. Figure 5.21 The condensation of 2 H2O1g2 to
