e how it looks even
now they are not. I have not called them liĴle boys in short trousers
for eﬀect. I have said it because it is true. Wetiko’s insatiable desire
for power over others is not a sign of its omnipotence, but its
insecurity. Paul Levy writes: ‘Due to the primal fear which
ultimately drives it and which it is driven to cultivate, wetiko’s body
politic has an intrinsic and insistent need for centralising power and
control so as to create imagined safety for itself.’ Yeeeeeees! Exactly!
Why does Wetiko want humans in an ongoing state of fear? Wetiko
itself is fear and it is petriﬁed of love. As evil is an absence of love, so
love is an absence of fear. Love conquers all and especially Wetiko
which is fear. Wetiko brought fear into the world when it wasn’t here
before. Fear was the ‘fall’, the fall into low-frequency ignorance and
illusion – fear is False Emotion Appearing Real. The simulation is
driven and energised by fear because Wetiko/Yaldabaoth (fear) are
the simulation
