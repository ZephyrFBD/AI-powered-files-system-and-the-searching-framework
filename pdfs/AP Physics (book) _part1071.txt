This result is called Torricelli’s theorem. Although it is seen to be a special case of
Bernoulli’s equation, it was discovered a century earlier by Evangelista Torricelli.
Equation 10–6 tells us that the liquid leaves the spigot with the same speed that 
a freely falling object would attain if falling from the same height. This should 
not be too surprising since the derivation of Bernoulli’s equation relies on the
conservation of energy.

Another special case of Bernoulli’s equation arises when a fluid is flowing
horizontally with no appreciable change in height; that is,
Then Eq. 10–5

which tells us quantitatively that the speed is high where the pressure is low, and
vice versa. It explains many common phenomena, some of which are illustrated
in Figs. 10–24 to 10–30. The pressure in the air blown at high speed across the
