Polysaccharides
A long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is known as a polysaccharide (poly- = “many”). The chain
may be branched or unbranched, and it may contain different types of monosaccharides. The molecular weight may be
100,000 daltons or more depending on the number of monomers joined. Starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin are primary
examples of polysaccharides.
Starch is the stored form of sugars in plants and is made up of a mixture of amylose and amylopectin (both polymers
of glucose). Plants are able to synthesize glucose, and the excess glucose, beyond the plant’s immediate energy needs, is
stored as starch in different plant parts, including roots and seeds. The starch in the seeds provides food for the embryo
as it germinates and can also act as a
