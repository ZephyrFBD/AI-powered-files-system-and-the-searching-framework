representative of the original, larger population.
(C) A small group of individuals from a larger population colonizes a new habitat. The small group that
colonizes the new habitat does not possess the genetic diversity of the original, larger population.
(D) Environmental pressures select for the individuals with the adaptations that give them a greater likelihood
of surviving and reproducing.
4. An isolated population in the United States are descendants of approximately 200 immigrants who arrived in the
1700s. Some individuals in this group of immigrants carried the allele for Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome. Today,
this allele occurs at a much higher frequency in the descendants of this group than in the general population in
the United States. This difference in the frequency of the Ellis-Van Creveld allele is an example of
(A) the bottleneck effect.
(B) the founder effect.
(C) natural selection.
(D) random mutations over multiple generations.
5. A scientist is studying the allele fr
