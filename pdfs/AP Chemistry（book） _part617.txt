5.0 M K2Cr2O7 solution must be diluted to prepare 250 mL of 
0.10 M solution? (c) If 10.0 mL of a 10.0 M stock solution of 
NaOH is diluted to 250 mL, what is the concentration of the 
resulting stock solution?
Converting liters to milliliters gives 15 mL.

▲ Figure 4.17 Procedure for solving stoichiometry problems involving reactions between a  
pure substance A and a solution containing a known concentration of substance B. Starting from  
a known mass of substance A, we follow the red arrows to determine either the volume of the  
solution containing B (if the molarity of B is known) or the molarity of the solution containing B  
(if
