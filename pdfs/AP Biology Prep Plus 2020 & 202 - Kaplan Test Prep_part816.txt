ype of limited increase is known as logistic growth. The rate of change in
size of natural populations can be estimated by the equation
, where
 = the change in the population size over the given time,
N = the size of the population at the beginning of time t,
r = the rate of population growth (again, a diﬀerence of the
reproduction and death rates), and
K = the carrying capacity.
These three lines show the increases in population size with the same
rates of population growth as in the previous graph, but with a limited
carrying capacity of 1,000 individuals. This graph shows that carrying
capacity is the ultimate limit to population size, while the rate of
population growth aﬀects how quickly the population increases. A
change in carrying capacity will change where the plateau occurs.
AP EXPERT NOTE
There is a good possibility that you will see a graph illustrating
exponential growth and carrying capacity on the AP Biology
exam. Be sure that you are able to interpret major trends such
