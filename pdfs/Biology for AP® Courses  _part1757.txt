he promoter that initiates transcription of the lac operon. However, for the
lac operon to be activated, two conditions must be met. First, the level of glucose must be very low or non-existent. Second,
lactose must be present. Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will the lac operon be transcribed (Figure 16.5).
This makes sense for the cell, because it would be energetically wasteful to create the proteins to process lactose if glucose
was plentiful or lactose was not available.

Figure 16.5 Transcription of the lac operon is carefully regulated so that its expression only occurs when glucose
is limited and lactose is present to serve as an alternative fuel source.
In E. coli, the trp operon is on by default, while the lac operon is off. Why do you think that this is the case?
a.
The trp operon is inducible and is positively regulated. Therefore it is ON by de
