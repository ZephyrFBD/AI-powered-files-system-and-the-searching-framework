s the two electrons move “down” the electron transport chain, they lose energy. The energy
lost by the electrons as they pass along the electron transport chain is used to phosphorylate, on average, about 1.5
ATP molecules.
5. Photosystem I. The electron transport chain terminates with PS I (with
 
P700). Here the electrons are again energized by sunlight and passed to
 
a primary electron acceptor (different from the one associated with PS II).
 
6. NADPH. The two electrons pass through a short electron transport
 
chain. At the end of the chain, the two electrons combine with NADP+ and H+ to form NADPH. Like NADH in
respiration, NADPH is a
coenzyme, electron acceptor, and forms an energy-rich molecule. (You can keep the two coenzymes NADH and
NADPH associated with the correct processes by using the P in NADPH as a reminder of the P in photosynthesis.
The P in NADPH, however, actually represents phosphorus.)
7. Splitting of Water. The two electrons that originated in PS II are now inc
