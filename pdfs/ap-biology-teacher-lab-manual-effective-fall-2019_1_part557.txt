1. Calculate the total number of transformed cells. 
Observe the number of colonies visible on your LB/amp plate. Do not open the 
plate!  Each colony on the plate can be assumed to be derived from a single cell. 
As individual cells reproduce, more and more cells are formed and develop into 
what is termed a colony. Thus, the most direct way to determine the total number 
of bacteria that were transformed with the plasmid is to count the colonies on the 
plate. 
2. Calculate the amount of plasmid DNA in the bacterial cells spread on the LB/amp 
plate. 
You need two pieces of information to find out the amount of plasmid DNA in 
the bacterial cells spread on the LB/amp plate: a) the total amount of DNA with 
which you began the experiment and b) the fraction of the DNA in the bacteria that 
actually got spread onto the LB/amp plate. 
Once you determine this information, you will multip
