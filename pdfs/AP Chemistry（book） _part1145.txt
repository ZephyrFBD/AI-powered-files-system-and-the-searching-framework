 Group
As we proceed down group 6A, there is a change from nonmetallic to metallic character 
(Figure 7.13). Oxygen, sulfur, and selenium are typical nonmetals. Tellurium is a metal-
loid, and polonium, which is radioactive and quite rare, is a metal. Oxygen is a colorless 
gas at room temperature; all of the other members of group 6A are solids. Some of the 
physical properties of the group 6A elements are given in Table 7.6.
As we saw in Section 2.6, oxygen exists in two molecular forms, O2 and O3. Because 
O2 is the more common form, people generally mean it when they say “oxygen,” 
although the name dioxygen is more descriptive. The O3 form is ozone. The two forms of 
oxygen are examples of allotropes, defined as different forms of the same element. About 
21% of dry air consists of O2 molecules. Ozone is present in very small amounts in the 
upper atmosphere and in polluted air. It is also formed from O2 in electrical discharges, 
such as in lightning storms:
