n in human wastes. By developing water purification and sewage systems, health hazards from human
wastes were reduced.
4. Expansion of habitat. Better housing, warmer clothing, and easy access to energy (for heating, cooling, and
cooking, for example) allowed humans to occupy environments that were previously unsuitable.
Community Ecology
Community ecology is concerned with the interaction of populations. One form of interaction is interspecific
competition (competition between different species). The following concepts describe the various ways in which
competition is resolved:
1. The competitive exclusion principle (Gauseâ€™s principle). When two species compete for exactly the same
resources (or occupy the same niche), one is likely to be more successful. As a result, one species outcompetes the
other, and eventually, the second species is eliminated. The competitive exclusion principle, formulated by biologist
G. F. Gause, states that no two species can sustain coexistence if they oc
