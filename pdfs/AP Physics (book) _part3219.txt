so as to function as a single unit. When atoms make such an attachment,
we say that a chemical bond has been formed. There are two main types of strong
chemical bond: covalent and ionic. Many bonds are actually intermediate between
these two types.

This computer processor chip contains over 1.4 billion transistors, plus diodes and other
semiconductor electronic elements, all in a space of about 1 cm2. It uses 22-nm
technology, meaning the “wires” (conducting lines) are 22 nm wide.
Before discussing semiconductors and their applications, we study the quantum
theory description of bondi
