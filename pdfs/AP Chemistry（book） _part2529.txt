acid 
and becomes bonded to the stronger base.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Based on information in Figure 16.4, place the following equi-
libria in order from smallest to largest value of Kc:
(i)   CH3COOH1aq2 + HS -1aq2 ∆ 
CH3COO -1aq2 + H2S1aq2
(ii)  F -1aq2 + NH4
+1aq2 ∆ HF1aq2 + NH31aq2
(iii) H2CO31aq2 + Cl -1aq2 ∆ HCO3
-1aq2 + HCl1aq2
(a) i 6 ii 6 iii (b) ii 6 i 6 iii (c) iii 6 i 6 ii  
(d) ii 6 iii 6 i (e) iii 6 ii 6 i
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
For each reaction, use Figure 16.4 to predict whether the equi-
librium lies to the left or to the right:
(a) HPO4
2 -1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ H2PO4
-1aq2 + OH -1aq2
(b) NH4
+1aq2 + OH -1aq2 ∆ NH31aq2 + H2O1l2

SECTION 16.3  The Autoionization of Water 
673
expression refers specifically to the autoionization of water, we use the symbol Kw to 
denote the equilibrium constant, which we call the ion-product constant for water. 
At 25 °C, Kw equals 1.0 * 10-14. Thus, we have
 
Kw = 3H3O+43OH-4 = 1.0 * 10-14 1at 25 °C2
