The principle of complementarity states that we must be
aware of both the particle and wave properties of light and of
matter for a complete understanding of them.
Electron microscopes (EM) make use of the wave proper-
ties of electrons to form an image: their “lenses” are magnetic.
Various types of EM exist: some can magnify 100,000* (1000*
better than a light microscope); others can give a 3-D image.
Early models of the atom include Rutherford’s planetary
(or nuclear) model of an atom which consists of a tiny but
massive positively charged nucleus surrounded (at a relatively
great distance) by electrons.
To explain the line spectra emitted by atoms, as well as the
stability of atoms, the Bohr model postulated that: (1) elec-
trons bound in an atom can only occupy orbits for which the
angular momentum is quantized, which results in discrete
values for the radius and energy; (2) an electron in such a
stationary state emits no radiation; (3) if an electron jumps t
