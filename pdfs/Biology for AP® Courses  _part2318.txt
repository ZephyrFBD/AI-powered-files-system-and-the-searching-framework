B, and -C. The
question arises as to the origins of each. The cladogram on
the right (after S. Tsuji et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci 1994)
displays a proposed relatedness of variations in LDHs over
many species.
B. Based on these data, describe the differences between
the likely evolutionary sequences of LDH-A, -B, and -C in
the African frog and in humans.
C. Evaluate the claim that in both species (African frog
and human), LDH-C is the most recently evolved form of
the enzyme.
51. Nucleotide-repeat sequences often occur within the
intron, and sequence variation is neutral, that is, there is no
selection. For example, the nucleotide-repeat sequence
labeled A might be ACGGGC, and the repeat sequence
labeled B might be ACTGGT. Repeat sequences evolve by
single-step duplication, deletion, and inversion, rather than
by single-nucleotide substitution. Because these repeat
sequences can be used to infer phylogeny, a phylogenetic
tree can be hypothesized based on the principle of
parsimonyâ€”the sim
