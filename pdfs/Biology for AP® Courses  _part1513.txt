d RNA products.
In eukaryotes, the advantage is that RNA and protein synthesis occurs much more quickly because they occur
in a single compartment.
c.
Compartmentalization in eukaryotic cells enables the building of simpler proteins and RNA products. In
prokaryotes, the advantage is only simpler proteins and RNA products because complex ones are not needed.
d.
Compartmentalization in eukaryotic cells enables the building of more complex proteins and RNA products.
In prokaryotes, the advantage is that RNA and protein synthesis takes more time because it occurs in a single
compartment.
The size of the genome in one of the most well-studied prokaryotes, E.coli, is 4.6 million base pairs (approximately 1.1
mm, if cut and stretched out). So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell? The DNA is twisted by what is known
as supercoiling. Supercoiling means that DNA is either under-wound (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or
over-wound (more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs)
