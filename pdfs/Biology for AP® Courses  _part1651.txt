d transcribe the eukaryotic gene.
The mouse genome includes one gene and two pseudogenes for cytoplasmic thymidine kinase. Pseudogenes are genes that
have lost their protein-coding ability or are no longer expressed by the cell. These pseudogenes are copied from mRNA and

incorporated into the chromosome. For example, the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a conserved CAAT box
(GGCCAATCT) at approximately -80. This sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors. Further
upstream of the TATA box, eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more GC-rich boxes (GGCG) or octamer boxes
(ATTTGCAT). These elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often
identified in more “active” genes that are constantly being expressed by the cell.
