body. The insect nervous system is more complex but also fairly
decentralized. It contains a brain, ventral nerve cord, and ganglia (clusters of connected neurons). These ganglia can control
movements and behaviors without input from the brain. Octopi may have the most complicated of invertebrate nervous
systemsâ€”they have neurons that are organized in specialized lobes and eyes that are structurally similar to vertebrate
species.
Figure 26.2 Nervous systems vary in structure and complexity. In (a) cnidarians, nerve cells form a decentralized nerve
net. In (b) echinoderms, nerve cells are bundled into fibers called nerves. In animals exhibiting bilateral symmetry
such as (c) planarians, neurons cluster into an anterior brain that processes information. In addition to a brain, (d)
arthropods have clusters of nerve cell bodies, called peripheral ganglia, located along the ventral nerve cord. Mollusks
such as squid and (e) octopi, which must hunt to survive, have complex brains containing
