ndelian
inheritance since it describes the inheritance of genes outside the
nucleus. Extranuclear inheritance occurs typically in mitochondria and
chloroplasts, which contain genes that replicate independently of cell
division. In vegetative segregation, the parent cell randomly distributes
genes from mitochondria and chloroplasts to daughter cells, whereas in
single-parent inheritance, oﬀspring only receive genes from one parent.
In humans, mitochondrial DNA is inherited entirely from the mother
(maternal inheritance).

Phenotype and Genotype: Other Factors to Consider
Many diﬀerent factors beyond those encompassed in Mendel’s
laws can aﬀect phenotype and genotype in oﬀspring. You should
be familiar with the following:
Incomplete dominance is a form of inheritance in which both
heterozygous alleles are expressed. This means that the
oﬀspring will display a combined phenotype that is distinct
from both parent organisms. For example, a plant with red
flowers and a plant wi
