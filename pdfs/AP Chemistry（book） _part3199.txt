n by 3 to obtain a balanced equa-
tion, we do not multiply the E°
red value by 3. 
As we have noted, the standard reduction 
potential is an intensive property and so is in-
dependent of the stoichiometric coefficients.
For each half-cell in a voltaic cell, the standard reduction potential provides a 
 
measure of the tendency for reduction to occur: The more positive the value of E°
red, the 
greater the tendency for reduction under standard conditions. In any voltaic cell operating 
under standard conditions, the E°
red value for the reaction at the cathode is more posi-
tive than the E°
red value for the reaction at the anode. Thus, electrons flow spontaneously 
through the external circuit from the electrode with the more negative value of E°
red to 
the electrode with the more positive value of E°
red. Figure 20.10 graphically illustrates the 
relationship between the standard reduction potentials for the two half-reactions in the 
Zn–Cu voltaic cell of Figure 20.5.
