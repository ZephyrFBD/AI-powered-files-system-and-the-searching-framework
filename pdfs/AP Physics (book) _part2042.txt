 used to connect a set
of appliances at 120 V, which draw 1450 W of power total.
(a) What power is wasted in 25.0 m of this wire? (b) What
is your answer if wire of diameter 0.412 cm is used?
88. Battery-powered electricity is very expensive compared
with that available from a wall receptacle. Estimate the
cost per kWh of (a) an alkaline D-cell (cost $1.70) and 
(b) an alkaline AA-cell (cost $1.25). These batteries can
provide a continuous current of 25 mA for 820 h and 120 h,
respectively, at 1.5 V. (c) Compare to the cost of a normal
120-V ac house source at 
89. A copper pipe has an inside diameter of 3.00 cm and an
outside diameter of 5.00 cm (Fig. 18–37).

length of this
pipe?

*90. The Tevatron accelerator at Fermilab (Illinois) is designed
to carry an 11-mA beam of protons 
traveling at very nearly the speed of light 
around a ring 6300 m in circumference. How many protons
are in the beam?
