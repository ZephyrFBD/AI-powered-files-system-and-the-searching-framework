Prokaryotes use the same RNA polymerase to transcribe all of their genes. In E. coli, the polymerase is composed of five
polypeptide subunits, two of which are identical. Four of these subunits, denoted α, α, β, and β' comprise the polymerase
core enzyme. These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed, and they disassemble once transcription is
complete. Each subunit has a unique role; the two α-subunits are necessary to assemble the polymerase on the DNA; the
β-subunit binds to the ribonucleoside triphosphate that will become part of the nascent “recently born” mRNA molecule;
and the β' binds the DNA template strand. The fifth subunit, σ, is involved only in transcription initiation. It confers
transcriptional specificity such that the polymerase begins to synthesize mRNA from an appropriate initiation site. Without
σ, the core enzyme would transcribe from random sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein
gibberish. The polymerase comprised of all five su
