ng, are possible. In 
both, each atom has a coordination number of 12.
Alloys are materials that possess characteristic metallic proper-
ties and are composed of more than one element. The elements in an 
alloy can be distributed either homogeneously or heterogeneously. 
Alloys which contain homogeneous mixtures of elements can either 
be substitutional or interstitial alloys. In a substitutional alloy the at-
oms of the minority element(s) occupy positions normally occupied 
by atoms of the majority element. In an interstitial alloy atoms of the 
minority element(s), often smaller nonmetallic atoms, occupy inter-
stitial positions that lie in the “holes” between atoms of the major-
ity element. In a heterogeneous alloy the elements are not distributed 
uniformly; instead, two or more distinct phases with characteristic 
compositions are present. Intermetallic compounds are alloys that have 
a fixed composition and definite properties.
