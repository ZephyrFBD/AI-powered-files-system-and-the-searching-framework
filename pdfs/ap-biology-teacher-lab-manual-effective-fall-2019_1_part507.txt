bacteria. 
Some E. coli cultures come prepared (or can be purchased) in a slant and will not 
have to be rehydrated. For bacteria that must be rehydrated, use a sterile pipette to 
add 250 μL of transformation solution directly to the vial. Recap the vial and allow 
the cell suspension to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. Then shake the 
mix before streaking on the LB starter plates. Store the rehydrated bacteria in the 
refrigerator until used (within 24 hours for best results and no longer than three 
days). 
2. Streak starter plates. 
Starter plates are needed to produce bacterial colonies of E. coli on agar plates. Each 
lab team will need its own starter plate as a source of cells for transformation. LB 
plates should be streaked for single colonies and incubated at 37°C for 24–26 hours 
before the transformation investigation begins. 
Using E. coli and LB agar plates, streak one starter plate for each of your student 
lab groups in order to generate single colonies from a
