spontaneous reaction is one which releases
free energy and moves to a more stable state.
Instantaneous reactions occur rapidly with
sudden release of energy.
b.
A spontaneous reaction is one which utilizes free
energy and moves to a more stable state.
Instantaneous reactions occur rapidly with
sudden release of energy.
c.
A spontaneous reaction is one which releases
free energy and moves to a more stable state.
Instantaneous reactions occur rapidly within a
system by uptake of energy.
d.
A spontaneous reaction is one in which the
reaction occurs rapidly with sudden release of
energy. Instantaneous reaction releases free
energy and moves to a more stable state.
35. Describe the position of the transition state on a
vertical energy scale, from low to high, relative to the
position of the reactants and products, for both endergonic
and exergonic reactions.
a.
The transition state of the reaction exists at a
lower energy level than the reactants. Activation
energy is always positive regard
