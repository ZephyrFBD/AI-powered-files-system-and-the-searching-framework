lled stoichiometrically equivalent quantities. The relationship between these 
quantities can be represented as
2 mol H2 ] 1 mol O2 ] 2 mol H2O
where the ] symbol means “is stoichiometrically equivalent to.” Stoichiometric relations 
such as these can be used to convert between quantities of reactants and products in a chemi-
cal reaction. For example, the number of moles of H2O produced from 1.57 mol of O2 is
Moles H2O = 11.57 mol O22a2 mol H2O
1 mol O2
b = 3.14 mol H2O

Mole-level
interpretation:
2 molecules H2
1 molecule O2
2 molecules H2O
2 mol H2
1 mol O2
2 mol H2O
4.0 g H2
32.0 g O2
36.0 g H2O
Notice the conservation of mass
(4.0 g + 32.0 g = 36.0 g)
Give It Some Thought 
When 1.57 mol O2 reacts with H2 to form H2O, how many moles of H2 are 
consumed in the process?
As an additional example, consider the combustion of butane 1C4H102, the fuel in 
disposable lighters:
 
2 C4H
