ery high energy electrons scattered off protons suggest
that protons are indeed made up of constituents.
Today, the truly fundamental particles are considered to be the six quarks,
the six leptons, the gauge bosons that carry the fundamental forces, and the
Higgs (page 939). See Table 32–5, where the quarks and leptons are arranged in
three “families” or “generations.” Ordinary matter—atoms made of protons,
neutrons, and electrons—is contained in the “first generation.” The others are
thought to have existed in the very early universe, but are seen by us today only
at powerful colliders or in cosmic rays. All of the hundreds of hadrons can be
accounted for by combinations of the six quarks and six antiquarks.
