ur body moving. When
your cells donâ€™t get enough oxygen, they do not make a lot of ATP. Instead, the small amount of ATP they make in the
absence of oxygen is accompanied by the production of lactic acid.
Mitochondria are oval-shaped, double membrane organelles (Figure 4.14) that have their own ribosomes and DNA. Each
membrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The inner layer has folds called cristae. The area surrounded
by the folds is called the mitochondrial matrix. The cristae and the matrix have different roles in cellular respiration.
Figure 4.14 This electron micrograph shows a mitochondrion as viewed with a transmission electron microscope. This
organelle has an outer membrane and an inner membrane. The inner membrane contains folds, called cristae, which
increase its surface area. The space between the two membranes is called the intermembrane space, and the space
inside the inner membrane is called the mitochondrial matrix. ATP synthesis takes place on the inn
