Below the thalamus is the hypothalamus, shown in Figure 26.24. The hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by
sending signals to the pituitary gland, a pea-sized endocrine gland that releases several different hormones that affect other
glands as well as other cells. This relationship means that the hypothalamus regulates important behaviors that are controlled
by these hormones. The hypothalamus is the body’s thermostat—it makes sure key functions like food and water intake,
energy expenditure, and body temperature are kept at appropriate levels. Neurons within the hypothalamus also regulate
circadian rhythms, sometimes called sleep cycles.
Limbic System
The limbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion, as well as behaviors related to fear and motivation.
It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus.
One important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure call
