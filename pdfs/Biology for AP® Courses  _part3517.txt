ith the release of ADP and inorganic phosphate. Another ATP binds the myosin head,
causing the cross-bridge to detach and returning myosin to the cocked configuration.
c.
The myosin head forms a cross-bridge with actin which initiates the power stroke. During the power stroke,
the myosin head bends with release of ADP and inorganic phosphate. Another ATP binds to the actin head,
causing the cross-bridge to detach and returning actin to the cocked configuration.
d.
The actin head forms a cross-bridge with myosin, which initiates the power stroke. During the power stroke,
the actin head bends with the release of ADP and inorganic phosphate. Another ATP binds to the actin head,
causing the cross-bridge to detach and returning actin to the cocked configuration.
Regulatory Proteins
When a muscle is in a resting state, actin and myosin are separated. To keep actin from binding to the active site
on myosin, regulatory proteins block the molecular binding sites. Tropomyosin blocks myosin bindi
