extremes. 
(D) The coloration in the population shifted toward more darker-colored beetles, as in diagram IV. The lighter-

38. Testosterone oxido-reductase is a liver enzyme that regulates testosterone levels in alligators.  
One study compared testosterone oxido-reductase activity between male and female alligators from Lake 
Woodruff, a relatively pristine environment, and from Lake Apopka, an area that has suffered severe 
contamination. The graph above depicts the findings of that study. 
  The data in the graph best support which of the following claims? 
(A) Environmental contamination elevates total testosterone oxido-reductase activity in females. 
(B) Environmental contamination reduces total testosterone oxido-reductase activity in females. 
(C) Environmental contamination elevates
