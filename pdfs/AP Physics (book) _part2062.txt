CHAPTER 19
DC Circuits
Series and parallel resistors. Two 
resistors are con-
nected (a) in parallel, and (b) in series, to a 24.0-V battery (Fig. 19–6). What is the
current through each resistor and what is the equivalent resistance of each circuit?
APPROACH We use Ohm’s law and the ideas just discussed for series and parallel
connections to get the current in each case. We can also use Eqs. 19–3 and 19–4.
SOLUTION (a) Any given charge (or electron) can flow through only one or
the other of the two resistors in Fig. 19–6a. Just as a river may break into two
streams when going around an island, here too the total current I from the
battery (Fig. 19–6a) splits to flow through each resistor, so I equals the sum of
the separate currents through the two resistors:
The potential difference across each resistor is the battery voltage 
Applying Ohm’s law to each resistor gives
The equivalent resistance is
We could also have obtained this result from Eq.
