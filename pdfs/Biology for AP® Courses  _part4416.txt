real twigs (Figure 36.21a). In another example, the chameleon can change its color to match its surroundings (Figure
36.21b). Both of these are examples of camouflage, or avoiding detection by blending in with the background.

Some species use coloration as a way of warning predators that they are not good to eat. For example, the cinnabar moth
caterpillar, the fire-bellied toad, and many species of beetle have bright colors that warn of a foul taste, the presence of
toxic chemical, and/or the ability to sting or bite, respectively. Predators that ignore this coloration and eat the organisms
will experience their unpleasant taste or presence of toxic chemicals and learn not to eat them in the future. T
