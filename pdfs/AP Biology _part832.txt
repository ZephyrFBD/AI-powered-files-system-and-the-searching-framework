ists of sweet pea seeds that are dormant and
not carrying out respiration. (This apparatus can also accommodate
invertebrates, such as insects and earthworms.)
Objective
Construct a respirometers that will measure oxygen consumption of
sprouted or unsprouted seeds. Observe the effects that different
temperatures have on the rate of respiration; see Figure 19.16.

Since the sprouted seeds absorbed water and were larger than the
unsprouted seeds, glass beads were added to the respirometer that held the
unsprouted seeds to equalize the volume of empty space in both vessels.
Set up six respirometers as shown in Table 19.1.
