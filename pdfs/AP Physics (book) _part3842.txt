Fictitious (Inertial) Forces
Because Newton’s laws do not hold when observations are made with respect to
a rotating frame of reference, calculation of motion can be complicated. How-
ever, we can still apply Newton’s laws in such a reference frame if we make use 
of a trick. The ball on the rotating platform of Fig. C–1a flies outward when
released (even though no force is actually acting on it). So the trick we use is to
write down the equation
as if a force equal to 
(or 
) were
acting radially outward on the object in addition to any other forces that may be
acting. This extra force, which might be designated as “centrifugal force” since it
seems to act outward, is called a fictitious force or pseudoforce. It is a pseudo-
force (“pseudo” means “false”) because there is no object that exerts this force.
Furthermore, when viewed from an inertial reference frame, the effect doesn’t
exist at all. We have made up this pseudoforce so that we can make calculations
in a noninertial frame u
