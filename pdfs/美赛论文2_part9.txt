to say, if 
susceptible people are vaccinated, they will be immune to Ebola and not seriously 
infected people can be cured with the drugs. But patients whose disease is advanced 
will die of Ebola even though they take the medication. In this problem, we need to 
set up a reasonable system to deliver the medication to eradicate Ebola or relieve 
current intense strain. To optimize the delivery system, we need to take factors like 
the spread of the disease, the quantity of the medication needed, the locations of 
delivery, the speed of manufacturing vaccines or drugs and so on into account. 
The analytical procedure is as follows: 
 Since West Africa has suffered most from Ebola and countries in this 
region have many similarities, we use Sierra Leone as an example to 
show the accurate value of the results in our models. 
 Set up Disease Spread Model on the basis of SIR Model and simulate 
the number of infected people in the future. The forecast statistics will 
affect the demand
