hat have two or more resonance structures involving p bonds.
One molecule that cannot be described with localized p bonds is benzene 1C6H62, 
which has two resonance structures: 
 (Section 8.6)
or
Benzene has a total of 30 valence electrons. To describe the bonding in benzene 
using hybrid orbitals, we first choose a hybridization scheme consistent with the geom-
etry of the molecule. Because each carbon is surrounded by three atoms at 120° angles, 
the appropriate hybrid set is sp2. Six localized C ¬C s bonds and six localized C ¬H s 
bonds are formed from the sp2 hybrid orbitals, as shown in Figure 9.25(a). Thus, 24 of 
the valence electrons are used to form the s bonds in the molecule.
