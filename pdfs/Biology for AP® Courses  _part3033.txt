rical
insulator, like the plastic wrap that surrounds the copper wires in a household appliance cord. The Schwann cells are
separated by gaps of unmyelinated fibers called nodes of Ranvier over which the nerve impulse travels as the signal passes
along the neuron, increasing the speed of transmission. (As we will learn in the Nervous System Disorders section, some
diseases of the nervous system result from the loss of myelin.) Glial cells—often thought of as the “supporting cast” of the
nervous system—outnumber neurons and play a role in the development of neurons, buffer harmful ions and chemicals, and
provide myelin sheaths around neurons. Most brain tumors are caused by mutations in glial cells.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based labo
