yeast cells. UV-c can be used to mutate a
strain of yeast in which the synthesis of adenine is
blocked. This mutation is observable because the ade-2
mutant has a red color when cultured on nutrient-
containing plates. Exposure to uv-c also can result in
additional mutations. In particular, one mutant, ade-7,
changes the color of the ade-2 mutant to white.
A. You have a uv-c lamp, culture plates, and growth
chambers at 23 °C and 37 °C. You also have available
known haploid strains that are (ade-2,+,+), where +
denotes the wild type. Design a plan to determine the rate
of uv-c-induced mutations in nutrient-containing plates
inoculated with yeast.
Earth's ozone layer removes high-energy ultraviolet
radiation, uv-c, from the solar radiation received at the
surface. Lower-energy ultraviolet radiation, uv-b, strikes
Earth’s surface. Damage to DNA induced by ultraviolet
radiation occurs with the formation of bonds between an
adjacent pair of pyrimidine nucleotides, thymine and
cytosine, on t
