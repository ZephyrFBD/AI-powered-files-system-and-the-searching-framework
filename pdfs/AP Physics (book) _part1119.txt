wind blowing over the flat roof of a
house causes the roof to lift off the house. If the house is
in size, estimate the weight of the roof.
Assume the roof is not nailed down.
50. (II) A 6.0-cm-diameter horizontal pipe gradually narrows
to 4.5 cm. When water flows through this pipe at a certain
rate, the gauge pressure in these two sections is 33.5 kPa
and 22.6 kPa, respectively. What is the volume rate of flow?

where the wind speed is

ple on a wing of area 
if the air passes over the top
and bottom surfaces at speeds of
