ea represents extensive growth.

50. Various drugs function by targeting a specific structure within a cell.
Because diﬀerent types of cells contain diﬀerent components, this allows
drugs to act with increased selectivity. Which of the following cellular
structures could be targeted specifically to aﬀect eukaryotes while not
aﬀecting prokaryotes?
Cell membrane
(A)
Chromosome
(B)
Endoplasmic reticulum
(C)
Ribosome
(D)
51. Based on the results of the experiment, the least likely cellular target of
the drug is the organism’s
mitochondria
(A)
Golgi apparatus
(B)
lysosomes
(C)
cell wall

52. The researchers perform a second set of experiments, focusing on
multicellular organisms. They collect data on the eﬀects of the drug on
diﬀerent types of cells in each organism. They find that the drug has the
greatest eﬀect on cells with a high concentration of rough ER and Golgi
bodies, a moderate amount of mitochondria and smooth ER, few
lysosomes, a cell wall, and no cilia. The likely primary
