so choices (A), (C), and (D) are all incorrect.
4. (D) Mitochondria are the site of ATP production for the cell. Muscle cells require large amounts of energy, so
muscle cells would be expected to have a higher concentration of mitochondria. Choice (A) is incorrect because
lysosomes break down macromolecules and cell parts; they do not produce energy. The Golgi complex modifies
and packages proteins but is not involved in energy production, so choice (B) is incorrect. Amyloplasts store
starches in plant cells, so choice (C) is incorrect.
5. (C) Lysosomes help break down large molecules, so a defect in the lysosomes could be a likely cause of
Niemann-Pick disease. The rough endoplasmic reticulum and the ribosomes serve functions in protein
synthesis; they do not break down molecules. So choices (A) and (D) are incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect
because the Golgi complex modifies and packages proteins.
6. (B) Eukaryotic cells have nuclei; prokaryotic cells do not. Thus, Hoechst 33342 coul
