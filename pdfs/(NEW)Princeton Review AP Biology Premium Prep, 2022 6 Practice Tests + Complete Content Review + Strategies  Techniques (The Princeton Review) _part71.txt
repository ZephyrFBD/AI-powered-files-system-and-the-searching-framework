coupled receptors (GPCRs) are necessary to bring a signal from outside the cell to inside the
cell. If the ligand is a small nonpolar molecule, then it can go through the membrane without trouble and
does not need an extracellular receptor.

B
According to the figure, the first step in the activation pathway was the binding of epinephrine, the
external ligand.
52.
C
The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) allows a message to be transmitted inside the cell without the
ligand actually entering the cell. This is most like a drive-through window where the order is
communicated to someone inside a restaurant, but the patron does not actually enter the building.
53.
B
The conformational change allows a message to be passed from the outside of the cell to the inside. The
conformational change is a sign that the ligand is bound. The ligand does not bind to the membrane, so
(A) is incorrect. The ligand triggers binding of the GTP-protein, so (D) is incorrect. A conformational
change would not
