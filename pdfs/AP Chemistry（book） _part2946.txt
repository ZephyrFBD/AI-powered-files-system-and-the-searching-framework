HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND EARTHâ€™S ATMOSPHERE (SECTION 18.2)  
Ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere from the reaction of 
atomic oxygen with O2. Ozone is itself decomposed by absorp-
tion of a photon or by reaction with an active species such as Cl. 
Chlorofluorocarbons can undergo photodissociation in the strato-
sphere, introducing atomic chlorine, which is capable of catalyt-
ically destroying ozone. A marked reduction in the ozone level in 
the upper atmosphere would have serious adverse consequences 
because the ozone layer filters out certain wavelengths of harmful 
ultraviolet light that are not removed by any other atmospheric 
component. In the troposphere the chemistry of trace atmospheric 
components is of major importance. Many of these minor com-
ponents are pollutants. Sulfur dioxide is one of the more noxious 
and prevalent examples. It is oxidized in air to form sulfur trioxide, 
which, upon dissolving in water, forms sulfuric acid. The oxides of 
sulfur are maj
