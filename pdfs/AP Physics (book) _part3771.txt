MAP and other experiments have convinced scientists that the universe is flat
and
But this cannot be only normal baryonic matter (atoms are 99.9%
baryons—protons and neutrons—by weight). These recent experiments put the
amount of normal baryonic matter in the universe at only about 5% of the critical
density. What is the other 95%? There is strong evidence for a significant amount
of nonluminous matter in the universe referred to as dark matter, which acts
normally under gravity, but does not absorb or radiate light sufficiently to be visible.
For example, observations of the rotation of galaxies suggest that they rotate as 
if they had considerably more mass than we can see. Recall from Chapter 5,
Example 5–12, that for a satellite of mass m revolving around Earth (mass M)
and hence
If we apply this equation to stars in a galaxy, we see
that their speed depends on galactic mass. Observations show that stars farther
from the galactic center revolve much faster than expected if there is
