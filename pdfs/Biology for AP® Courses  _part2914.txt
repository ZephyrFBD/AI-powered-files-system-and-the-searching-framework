r digestive systems have also evolved to
accommodate their various dietary needs.
Herbivores, Omnivores, and Carnivores
Herbivores are animals whose primary food source is plant-based. Examples of herbivores, as shown in Figure 25.2
include vertebrates like deer, koalas, and some bird species, as well as invertebrates such as crickets and caterpillars. These
animals have evolved digestive systems capable of handling large amounts of plant material. Herbivores can be further
classified into frugivores (fruit-eaters), granivores (seed eaters), nectivores (nectar feeders), and folivores (leaf eaters).

Carnivores are animals that eat other animals. The word carnivore is derived from Latin and literally means “meat eater.”
