exerting a selection pressure.
d.
return each year for several years and repeat this
examination of the enzyme, calculating
frequencies of each allele each year. If the allele
frequencies are changing, the gene is not in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Analysis of the
dependence of allele frequencies on temperature
could indicate selection.
42. Calamus finmarchicus is the dominant copepod in the
Gulf of Maine. The polymorphic aminopeptidase locus,
Lap-1, has been shown to be useful for the genetic
differentiation of populations of this organism. By
examining the population dynamics of copepods, the
dynamics of the fin fish on which they feed can be
predicted. The aerial photograph shows a landmass
separating two coastal estuarine habits, the mud flats of
Egypt Bay and the Mount Desert Narrows. For the past 40
years, transport between the two habits has been hindered
by a dam over the Carrying Place Inlet. However, small
volumes of water occasionally
