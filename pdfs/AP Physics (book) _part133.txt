Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension

The train is moving 
with respect to the ground, so the

For now we only discuss objects that move without rotating (Fig. 2–1a).
Such motion is called translational motion. In this Chapter we will be concerned
with describing an object that moves along a straight-line path, which is one-
dimensional translational motion. In Chapter 3 we will describe translational
motion in two (or three) dimensions along paths that are not straight. (Rotation,
shown in Fig. 2–1b, is discussed in Chapter 8.)
We will often use the concept, or model, of an idealized particle which is
considered to be a mathematical point with no spatial extent (no size). A point
particle can undergo only translational motion. The partic
