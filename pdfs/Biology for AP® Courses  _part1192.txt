25. Chemotherapy drugs such as vincristine and
colchicines disrupt mitosis by binding to tubulin (the
subunit of microtubules) and interfering with microtubule
assembly and disassembly. Exactly what mitotic structure
do these drugs target, and what effect would that have on
cell division?

a.
The drugs bind tubulin and inhibit the binding of
spindle to the chromosome. This can arrest the
cell cycle.
b.
The drugs bind the tubulin, which leads to an
error in the chromosome separation. This could
lead to apoptosis.
c.
The drugs bind the tubulin, thereby inhibiting
their division in S-phase. This inhibits cell
division.
d.
The drugs bind the spindle fiber and hinder the
separation of chromatins. This promotes the
division spontaneously.
26. List some reasons why a cell that has just completed
cytokinesis might enter the G0 phase instead of the G1
phase.
a.
Some cells are ph
