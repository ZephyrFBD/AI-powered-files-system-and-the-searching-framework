Archimedes’ principle is also useful in geology. According to the theories of
plate tectonics and continental drift, the continents float on a fluid “sea” of slightly
deformable rock (mantle rock). Some interesting calculations can be done using
very simple models, which we consider in the Problems at the end of the Chapter.
Air is a fluid, and it too exerts a buoyant force. Ordinary objects weigh less 
in air than they do in a vacuum. Because the density of air is so small, the effect for
ordinary solids is slight. There are objects, however, that float in air—helium-filled
balloons, for example, because the density of helium is less than the density of air.
