free-body diagram.]
19. (II) A traffic light hangs from a pole as shown in Fig. 9–59.
The uniform aluminum pole AB is 7.20 m long and has a
mass of 12.0 kg. The mass of the traffic light is 21.5 kg.
Determine (a) the tension in the horizontal massless 
cable CD, and (b) the vertical and horizontal components
of the force exerted by the pivot A on the aluminum pole.
20. (II) A uniform steel beam has a mass of 940 kg. On it is
resting half of an identical beam, as shown in Fig. 9–60.
What is the vertical support force at each end?

24. (II) A 172-cm-tall person lies on a light (massless) board
which is supported by two scales, one under the top of her
head and one beneath the bottom of her feet (Fig. 9–64).
The two scales read, respectively, 35.1 and 31.6 kg. What
distance is the center of gravity of this person from the
bottom
