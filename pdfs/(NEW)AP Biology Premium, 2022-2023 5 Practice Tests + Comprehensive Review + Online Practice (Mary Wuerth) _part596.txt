percentage of recombination
events between the centromere and the spore color gene is proportional to the distance between them.
Lab 8: Bacterial Transformation
Biotechnology has transformed medicine by making medications (such as insulin) more readily available and
creating personalized therapies to treat some cancers and genetic disorders. Many of these medical advances involve
inserting new DNA into cells. One technique for inserting DNA into cells is transformation, the uptake and
expression of foreign DNA by a cell. In this lab, a gene carried on a plasmid, a small circular piece of DNA, is
inserted into bacterial cells. Heat shock is the procedure used to insert the plasmid into the bacterial cells.
Plasmids in nature often contain genes for antibiotic resistance. These genes for antibiotic resistance can be used
as selectable markers to detect which bacteria have absorbed the plasmid. For example, say you perform a bacterial
transformation procedure using a plasmid that contains
