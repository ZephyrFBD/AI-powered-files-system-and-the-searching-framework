 Development of the Lab Investigations 
To create a model of excellence for the lab component in AP science courses, the College 
Board worked in conjunction with the AP Lab Manual Vision Team and AP Biology Lab 
Development Team to create an innovative vision and approach to lab investigations. 
Both teams of subject matter experts consisted of AP Biology teachers and higher 
education faculty members, as well as experts in the fields of inquiry instruction, 
quantitative skill application, and lab investigations. Collectively, they created AP Biology 
Investigative Labs: An Inquiry-Based Approach. The labs in this manual support the 
concepts, content, and science practices within the revised AP Biology course.
