st less important) DNA at the ends of a molecule. These ends are called telomeres. They get shorter and
shorter over time.
Many enzymes and proteins are involved in DNA replication. The ones you’ll need to know for the AP Biology
Exam are DNA helicase, DNA polymerase, DNA ligase, topoisomerase, and RNA primase:
Helicase unwinds our double helix into two strands.
DNA Polymerase adds nucleotides to an existing strand.
Ligase brings together the Okazaki fragments.
Topoisomerase cuts and rejoins the helix.
RNA primase catalyzes the synthesis of RNA primers.
If you are interested in some of the history behind the early DNA experiments,
we have included a short addendum in your online student tools. It will not,
however, be tested.
Central Dogma
DNA’s main role is directing the manufacture of molecules that actually do the work in the body. DNA is just the
recipe book, not the chef or the meal. When a DNA recipe is used, scientists say that that DNA is expressed.
The first step of DNA expres
