did not produce free oxygen (anoxygenic photosynthesis). (Early
photosynthesis did not produce free oxygen because it did not use water as the source of hydrogen
ions; instead, it used materials like hydrogen sulfide and consequently produced sulfur). It is thought that
glycolysis developed at this time and could take advantage of the simple sugars being produced, but these
reactions were unable to fully extract the energy stored in the carbohydrates. The development of glycolysis
probably predated the evolution of photosynthesis, as it was well suited to extract energy from materials
spontaneously accumulating in the “primeval soup.” A later form of photosynthesis used water as a source
of electrons and hydrogen, and generated free oxygen. Over time, the atmosphere became oxygenated,
but not before the oxygen released oxidized metals in the ocean and created a “rust” layer in the sediment,
permitting the dating of the rise of the first oxygenic photosynthesizers. Living things adapted
