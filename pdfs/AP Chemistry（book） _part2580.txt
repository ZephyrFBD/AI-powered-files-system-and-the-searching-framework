ite the chemical equation and tabulate initial and equilibrium 
concentrations.
Ignoring the concentration of H2O because 
it is not involved in the equilibrium-constant 
expression, we see that the equilibrium con-
centrations are:

Inserting these quantities into the  
equilibrium-constant expression gives:

CHAPTER 16 Acid–Base Equilibria
In organic amines, at least one N¬H bond in NH3 is replaced with an N¬C bond. Like 
NH3, amines can abstract a proton from a water molecule by forming an N¬H bond, as 
shown here for methylamine:

Anions of weak acids make up the second general category of weak bases. In an aque-
ous solution of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), for example, NaClO dissociates to Na+ and 
ClO- ions. The Na+ ion is always a spectator ion in acid–base reactions. 
 (Section 4.3) 
The ClO- ion, however, is the conjugate base of a weak acid, hypo
