into the pathways of glucose catabolism (Figure 7.17). Each amino acid must have its amino group removed prior
to entry into these pathways. The amino group is converted into ammonia. In mammals, the liver synthesizes urea from two
ammonia molecules and a carbon dioxide molecule. Thus, urea is the principal waste product in mammals, produced from
the nitrogen originating in amino acids, and it leaves the body in urine.

citric acid cycle. (credit: modification of work by Mikael Häggström)
Connections of Lipid and Glucose Metabolisms
The lipids that are connected to the glucose pathways are cholesterol and triglycerides. Cholesterol is a lipid that contributes
to cell membrane flexibility and is a precursor of steroid hormones. The synthesis of cholesterol starts with acetyl groups
and proceeds in only one direction. The process cannot be reversed.
Triglycerides are a form
