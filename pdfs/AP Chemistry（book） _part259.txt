hat the atom is composed of subatomic particles. Before we summarize 
the current model, we briefly consider a few of the landmark discoveries that led to 
that model. We will see that the atom is composed in part of electrically charged 
particles, some with a positive charge and some with a negative charge. As we dis-
cuss the development of our current model of the atom, keep in mind this fact: 
Particles with the same charge repel one another, whereas particles with opposite charges 
attract one another.
Cathode Rays and electrons
During the mid-1800s, scientists began to study electrical discharge through a glass 
tube pumped almost empty of air (Figure 2.3). When a high voltage was applied to the 
electrodes in the tube, radiation was produced between the electrodes. This radiation, 
called cathode rays, originated at the negative electrode and traveled to the positive 
electrode. Although the rays could not be seen, their presence was detected because they 
cause certain materia
