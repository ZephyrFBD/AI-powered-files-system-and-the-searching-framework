tein found in red blood cells that is comprised of two alpha and two beta subunits that surround an
iron-containing heme group. Oxygen readily binds this heme group. The ability of oxygen to bind increases as more
oxygen molecules are bound to heme. Disease states and altered conditions in the body can affect the binding ability of
oxygen, and increase or decrease its ability to dissociate from hemoglobin.
Carbon dioxide can be transported through the blood via three methods. It is dissolved directly in the blood, bound to
plasma proteins or hemoglobin, or converted into bicarbonate. The majority of carbon dioxide is transported as part of the
bicarbonate system. Carbon dioxide diffuses into red blood cells. Inside, carbonic anhydrase converts carbon dioxide into
carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is subsequently hydrolyzed into bicarbonate (HCO3
âˆ’) and H+. The H+ ion binds to
hemoglobin in red blood cells, and bicarbonate is transported out of the red blood cells in exchange for a chloride
