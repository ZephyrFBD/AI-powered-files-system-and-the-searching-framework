 types of carbohydrates, based on
the number of subunits they have. Monosaccharides have a single
subunit or monomer. Common monosaccharides are fructose,
glucose, ribose, and galactose. Disaccharides are composed of two
sugar subunits, which are joined together through dehydration
synthesis, also known as a condensation reaction. Common
disaccharides are maltose, lactose, and sucrose. The third type of
carbohydrates, polysaccharides, are formed when more than two
monosaccharides are joined together. Common polysaccharides are
cellulose, starch, glycogen, and chitin. In this question, three of the
answers, (B), (C), and (D), are monosaccharides, while the fourth, (A),
is a polysaccharide. The question stem states that the membrane is
selectively permeable, but since there are no active transport
mechanisms built into the bag, passive transport is the only way for
molecules to enter or leave. As a result, small molecules like water and
monosaccharides will be able to cross, while a larg
