Structure and function in biology result from the presence of genetic information and the correct expression of this
information. In the chapter on DNA structure and function, we explored how genes are translated into proteins, which in
turn determine the nature of the cell. But how does a cell know when to “turn on” its DNA? With few exceptions, each cell
in your body contains identical genetic information. If each cell has the same exact DNA make up, how is it that a liver cell
differs from a nerve or muscle cell?
As we will discover, although each cell shares the same genome and DNA sequence, each cell does not express exactly
the same genes. Many factors determine when and how genes are expressed in a given cell. Even the type of chromosome
a gene is located on, like whether it is a sex chromosome or not, can determine its expression pattern, as can mutations
or changes in DNA sequence and other external factors. In prokaryotes, gene expression is regulated pr
