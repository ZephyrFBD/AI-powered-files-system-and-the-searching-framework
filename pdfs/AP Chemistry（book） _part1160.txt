higher 
effective nuclear charge experienced by the core electrons. The first 
ionization energies of the elements show periodic trends that are 
opposite those seen for atomic radii, with smaller atoms having 
higher first ionization energies. Thus, first ionization energies de-
crease as we go down a column and increase as we proceed left to 
right across a row.
We can write electron configurations for ions by first writing 
the electron configuration of the neutral atom and then removing 
or adding the appropriate number of electrons. For cations, electrons 
are removed first from the orbitals of the neutral atom with the larg-
est value of n. If there are two valence orbitals with the same value of 
n (such as 4s and 4p), then the electrons are lost first from the orbital 
with a higher value of l (in this case, 4p). For anions, electrons are 
added to orbitals in the reverse order.
