transcript,
referred to as pre-mRNA, needs to be modified before it can leave the nucleus of the cell and travel to the
ribosomes for translation.
In eukaryotic cells, three modifications must occur to the pre-mRNA before it can leave the nucleus: the removal
of introns and the joining of exons, the addition of a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) cap to the 5′ end of the RNA, and
the addition of a poly-adenine (poly-A) tail to the 3′ end of the RNA.
1. Eukaryotic pre-mRNAs contain noncoding RNA sequences called introns. These introns are interspersed
between coding sequences of eukaryotic RNAs called exons. Structures called spliceosomes, which are made
of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), remove the introns from
the pre-mRNA and then splice together the exons. These exons can be joined in different combinations to
generate multiple RNA transcripts from the same gene, as shown in Figure 16.1. This alternative splicing
gives eukaryotes the ability to
