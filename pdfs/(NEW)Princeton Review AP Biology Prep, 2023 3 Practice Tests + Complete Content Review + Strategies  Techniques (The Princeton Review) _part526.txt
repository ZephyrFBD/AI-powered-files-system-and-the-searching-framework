Bacterial cells can be visualized using light microscopy. In fact, back in the 17th century, some of the earliest
studies using primitive microscopes recorded the shape and organization of bacteria. Choices (A), (B), and (D)
are incorrect because virus and cell organelle structures are too small to be observed using light microscopy
and require electron microscopy.

The cell wall is a structure that is present in bacteria but absent in animal cells. Consequently, this structure is
targeted by several leading classes of antibiotics and would be an effective target of therapeutics against V.

that are present in animal cells.

Based on the microscopy data, the organism has a cell wall and lacks mitochondria. The presence of a cell wall
suggests that the organism is not a protozoan, so eliminate (B). The absence of mitochondria is indicative
