eographic poles, which are on the Earth’s axis of rotation. The north magnetic
pole, for example, is in the Canadian Arctic, now on the order of 1000 km† from the
geographic north pole, or true north. This difference must be taken into account
for accurate use of a compass (Fig. 20–6). The angular difference between the
direction of a compass needle (which points along the magnetic field lines) at any
location and true (geographical) north is called the magnetic declination. In the
U.S. it varies from 0° to about 20°, depending on location.
Notice in Fig. 20–5 that the Earth’s magnetic field at most locations is not
tangent to the Earth’s surface. The angle that the Earth’s magnetic field makes
with the horizontal at any point is referred to as the angle of dip, or the
“inclination.” It is 67° at New York, for example, and 55° at Miami.

decades. Magnetism in rocks s
