ly equal pieces. This was startling, for until then the known
nuclear reactions involved knocking out only a tiny fragment (for example,
n, p, or ) from a nucleus.
Nuclear Fission and Chain Reactions
This new phenomenon was named nuclear fission because of its resemblance to
biological fission (cell division). It occurs much more readily for 
than for the

The process can be visualized by imagining the uranium
nucleus to be like a liquid drop. According to this liquid-drop model, the neutron
absorbed by the 
nucleus (Fig. 31–3a) gives the nucleus extra internal energy
(like heating a drop of water). This intermediate state, or compound nucleus, is 
(because of the absorbed neutron), Fig. 31–3b. The extra energy of this nucleus—
it is in an excited state—appears as increased motion of the individual nucleons
inside, which causes the nucleus to take on abnormal elongated shapes. When the
nucleus elongates (in this model) into the shape shown in Fig. 31–3c, the attraction
