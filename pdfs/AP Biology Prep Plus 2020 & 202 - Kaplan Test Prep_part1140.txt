enetic processes happening in the nucleus, but translation only happens
in the ribosome, making (D) incorrect.
9. D
The question stem states that haygrazer grows faster and has drier soil
during times of heavy rainfall compared to that of bermudagrass. (A), (B)
and (C) are all direct contradictions of that information. (D) is correct
because if haygrazer absorbs more water and nutrients, then it will have
drier soil and better growth.
10. C
Plant phototropism is a plantâ€™s response to light and darkness. The finding
that haygrazers produce energy through photosynthesis faster during the
summer season suggests that haygrazers grow better when exposed to
more hours of light. The length of days is longer in the summer season, so
haygrazers would be classified as long-day plants, which require less than
12 hours of darkness to grow. Thus, (C) is correct. (A), (B), and (D) are
incorrect because haygrazers are not short-day plants, which grow better
when the day length is less than 12 hours o
