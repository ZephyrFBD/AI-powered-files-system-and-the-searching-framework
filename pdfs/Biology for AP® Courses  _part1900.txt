ap. Pairwise-end sequencing is, therefore, more cumbersome than shotgun sequencing,
but it is easier to reconstruct the sequence because there is more available information.
Next-generation Sequencing
Since 2005, automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are under the umbrella of next-generation sequencing,
which is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing. These automated low-cost sequencers can
generate sequences of hundreds of thousands or millions of short fragments (25 to 500 base pairs) in the span of one day.
These sequencers use sophisticated software to get through the cumbersome process of putting all the fragments in order.

Comparing Sequences
A sequence alignment is an arrangement of proteins, DNA, or RNA; it is used to identify regions of similarity
between cell types or species, which may indicate conservation of function or structures. Sequence
alignments may be used to construct phylogenetic tre
