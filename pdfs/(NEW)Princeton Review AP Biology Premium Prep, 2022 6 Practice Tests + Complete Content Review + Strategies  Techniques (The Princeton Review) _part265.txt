made, it tells the pathway to make even more X. This is less common,
but it occurs during fruit ripening and labor and delivery, which ramps up and up as it proceeds.
You won’t need to remember this specific example, but if it helps to better
visualize the positive feedback pathway, consider this. When a baby pushes
their head against the mother’s womb, the womb’s stretching causes a
hormone called oxytocin to be released. In turn, oxytocin triggers the mother’s
womb muscles to contract, pushing the baby harder against the womb. This
causes a cycle: further stretching of the womb, further oxytocin release, more
womb contractions, and so on, until the baby is delivered.
Cell Communication in Plants
Plants do not have a nervous system but can produce several proteins found in animal nervous systems, such as
certain neurotransmitter receptors. Plants can also generate electrical signals in response to environmental stimuli,
and this can affect flowering, respiration, photosynthesis, and w
