fore strikes many of
the internal surfaces of the diamond before it strikes one at less than 25° and
emerges. After many such reflections, the light has traveled far enough that the
colors have become sufficiently separated to be seen individually and brilliantly
by the eye after leaving the diamond.
The visible spectrum, Fig. 24–12, does not show all the colors seen in nature.
For example, there is no brown in Fig. 24–12. Many of the colors we see are
a mixture of wavelengths. For practical purposes, most natural colors can be
reproduced using three primary colors. They are red, green, and blue for direct
source viewing such as TV and computer monitors. For inks used in printing, the
primary colors are cyan (the blue color of the margin notes in this book), yellow,
and magenta (the pinkish red color we use for light rays in ray diagrams).
