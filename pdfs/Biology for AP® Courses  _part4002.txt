pathogenic antigens. Naïve T cells produce
antibodies in the humoral immune response,
while naïve B cells stimulate the cell-mediated
immune response.
b.
Naïve B and T cells are lymphocytes of the B
and T types that normally circulate in the body
at all times and have not come into contact with
any pathogenic antigens. Activated T cells
produce antibodies in the humoral immune
response, while activated B cells stimulate the
cell-mediated immune response.
