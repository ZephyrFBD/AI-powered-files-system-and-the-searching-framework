ers are formed by a condensation reaction of two 
molecules of alcohol. Several functional groups contain the carbonyl 
1C â€œO2 group, including aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, 
and amides. Aldehydes and ketones can be produced by the oxida-
tion of certain alcohols. Further oxidation of the aldehydes produces 
carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids can form esters by a condensation 
reaction with alcohols, or they can form amides by a condensation 
reaction with amines. Esters undergo hydrolysis (saponification) in the 
presence of strong bases.
CHIRALITY IN ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (SECTION 24.5) Molecules 
that possess nonsuperimposable mirror images are termed chiral. 
The two nonsuperimposable forms of a chiral molecule are called en-
antiomers. In carbon compounds, a chiral center is created when all 
four groups bonded to a central carbon atom are different. Many of 
the molecules occurring in living systems, such as the amino acids, 
are chiral and exist in nature in only one
