is sudden rise in Ca++ levels stimulates the
vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release the
neurotransmitter by exocytosis into the synaptic cleft. Once in the synapse,
the neurotransmitter bonds with receptors on the postsynaptic side,
altering the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell and resulting in a
response. Depending on the type of receptors and the ion channels they
control, the postsynaptic cell will be either inhibited or excited. In
vertebrates, synapses between motor neurons and muscle cells are always
excitatory. However, synapses between neurons can also be inhibitory by
causing hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic cell.
Shortly after the neurotransmitter is released into the synapse, it is
destroyed by an enzyme called esterase and recycled by the presynaptic
neuron. The neurotransmitter at all neuro-muscular junctions is
acetylcholine. Other neurotransmitters are serotonin, epinephrine,
norepinephrine, and dopamine. In addition, the neurotransmit
