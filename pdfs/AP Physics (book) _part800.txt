in the object moves through the same angle in the same time interval.
An object such as the wheel in Fig. 8–3 can rotate about a fixed axis either
clockwise or counterclockwise. The direction can be specified with a
or 
sign.
The usual convention is to choose the angular displacement 
and angular velocity 
as positive when the wheel rotates counterclockwise. If the rotation is clockwise,
then would decrease, so 
and 
would be negative.

Rotational Motion
†Even for an angle as large as 15°, the error in making this estimate is only 1%, but for larger angles
the error increases rapidly. (The chord is the straight-line distance between the ends of the arc.)
