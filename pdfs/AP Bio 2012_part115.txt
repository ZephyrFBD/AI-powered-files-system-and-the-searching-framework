ergy than the additional step of urea conversion. Dehydration due to 
water loss is not a problem for freshwater fish because water is plentiful.
(C)
This option is incorrect because ammonia is not concentrated in tissues for 
storage; this would be toxic to those cells.
(D)
This option is incorrect because the nitrogen in ammonia is not recycled; it is so 
toxic that fish need to get rid of it quickly. In addition, animals do not possess 
the ability to recycle ammonia, most likely due to the lack of enzymes capable of 
catalyzing this reaction.

Question 22
Essential Knowledge
3.C.3: Viral replication results in genetic variation, and 
viral infection can introduce genetic variation into  
the hosts.
