a.
A prokaryotic organism’s rate of replication is
ten times faster than that of eukaryotes.
Prokaryotes have a single origin of replication
and use five types of polymerases, while
eukaryotes have multiple sites of origin and use
fourteen polymerases. Telomerase is absent in
prokaryotes. DNA pol I is the primer remover in
prokaryotes, while in eukaryotes it is RNase H.
DNA pol III performs strand elongation in
prokaryotes and pol δ and pol ε do the same
in eukaryotes.
