 alleles are placed in the gene location for eye color (its
genotype). Sometimes an organism will have a genotype that includes
an allele that is not expressed in its phenotype.
In a typical diploid (2N) eukaryotic organism, each cell has two copies of
each chromosome. These pairs of chromosomes are a result of the
combination of two haploid gametes formed by meiosis, one from the
mother and one from the father. The mother and father each provided
one allele for each gene, leaving the oﬀspring with either two of the same

allele (e.g., two for blue eye color or two for green eye color) or one of
each allele (e.g., one allele for blue eye color and one allele for green eye
color). In many genes, there is one allele that is dominant over the other
and hides the expression of the other allele in the phenotype of the
oﬀspring. The other allele is called recessive. Geneticists generally use
