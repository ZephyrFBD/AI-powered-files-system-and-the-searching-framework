CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
29. Describe the connection between anabolic and
catabolic chemical reactions in a metabolic pathway.
a.
Catabolic reactions produce energy and simpler
compounds, whereas anabolic reactions involve
the use of energy to make more complex
compounds.
b.
Catabolic reactions produce energy and complex
compounds are formed, whereas in anabolic
reactions free energy is utilized by complex
compounds to make simpler molecules.
c.
Catabolic reactions utilize energy and gives
simpler compounds, whereas in anabolic
reactions reactions, energy is produced and
simpler compounds are used to make complex
molecules.
d.
Catabolic reactions produce energy and water
