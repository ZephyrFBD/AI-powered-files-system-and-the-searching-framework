dentified as hydrogen. Tritium is an isotope that has one proton and two neutrons, for a total of three
particles in its nucleus. Choice (A) is correct. Choice (B) is not correct because two protons would mean
that the element is helium, not hydrogen. Choice (C) is not correct because the atomic number, one, will
never change without changing the identity of the atom. Finally, (D) is not correct because radioactive
atoms do not give off electrons.

C
Active transport is the movement of substances across a membrane against their concentration gradient
through the use of energy (ATP). The sodium-potassium pump is a critical structure which uses ATP
hydrolysis to move sodium and potassium ions against their respective concentration gradients. Diffusion
of oxygen is an example of simple diffusion and can occur without the need of channels or pores. Water
uses aquaporins to travel across the membrane, down its concentration gradient; therefore,
