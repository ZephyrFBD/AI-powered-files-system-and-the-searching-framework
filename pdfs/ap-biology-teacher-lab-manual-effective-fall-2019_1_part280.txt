Below is a list of some gene suggestions you could investigate using BLAST. As you look 
at a particular gene, try to answer the following questions: 
•  What is the function in humans of the protein produced from that gene? 
•  Would you expect to find the same protein in other organisms? If so, which ones?  
•  Is it possible to find the same gene in two different kinds of organisms but not find 
the protein that is produced from that gene?  
•  If you found the same gene in all organisms you test, what does this suggest about the 
evolution of this gene in the history of life on earth?  
•  Does the use of DNA sequences in the study of evolutionary relationships mean that 
other characteristics are unimportant in such studies? Explain your answer.
