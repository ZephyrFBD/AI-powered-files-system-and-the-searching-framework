You can find this with a 2×2 Punnett square.
For the F2 generation, the law of segregation requires that each gamete receive either an R allele or an r allele along with
either a Y allele or a y allele. The law of independent assortment states that a gamete into which an r allele sorted would
be equally likely to contain either a Y allele or a y allele. Thus, there are four equally likely gametes that can be formed
when the YyRr heterozygote is self-crossed, as follows: YR, Yr, yR, and yr. Arranging these gametes along the top and left
of a 4 × 4 Punnett square (Figure 12.16) gives us 16 equally likely genotypic combinations. From these genotypes, we
infer a phenotypic ratio of 9 round/yellow:3 round/green:3 wrinkled/yellow:1 wrinkled/green (Figure 12.16). These are the
offspring ratios we would expect, assuming we performed the crosses with a large enough sample size.
Because of independent assortment and dominance, the 9:3:3:1 dihybrid phenotypic ratio can be collap
