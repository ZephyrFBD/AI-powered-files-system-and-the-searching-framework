Voltmeter design. Using a galvanometer with internal
resistance
and full-scale current sensitivity of 
design a voltmeter
that reads from 0 to 15 V. Is the scale linear?
APPROACH When a potential difference of 15 V exists across the terminals of our
voltmeter, we want 
to be passing through it so as to give a full-scale deflection.
SOLUTION From Ohm’s law,
we have (Fig. 19–32)
so
Notice that 
is so small compared to the value of 
that it doesn’t
influence the calculation significantly. The scale will again be linear: if the volt-
age to be measured is 6.0 V, the current passing through the voltmeter will be
or 
This will produce two-fifths
of full-scale deflection, as required (6.0 V15.0 V = 25).
