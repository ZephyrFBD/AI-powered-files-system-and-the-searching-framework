 for the reverse of this reaction?
Sample Exercise 19.7 
Calculating Standard Free-Energy Change from Free Energies of Formation
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to calculate the free-energy change for a reac-
tion and then to determine the free-energy change for the reverse 
reaction.
Plan We look up the free-energy values for the products and reac-
tants and use Equation 19.14. We multiply the molar quantities by 
the coefficients in the balanced equation and subtract the total for 
the reactants from that for the products.
Solve
(a) Cl21g2 is in its standard state, so ∆Gf° is zero for this reactant. 
P41g2, however, is not in its standard state, so ∆Gf° is not zero 
for this reactant. From the balanced equation and values from 
Appendix C, we have
 
∆G°
rxn = 4 ∆Gf°3PCl31g24 - ∆Gf°3P41g24 - 6 ∆Gf°3Cl21g24
 = 14 mol21-269.6 kJ>mol2 - 11 mol2124.4 kJ>mol2 - 0
 = -1102.8 kJ
That ∆G° is negative tells us that a mixture of P41g2, Cl21g2, and 
PCl31g2 at 25 °C, each present at a partial pres
