n this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are the stages in the process of organogenesis in vertebrate animals?
•
What are the anatomical axes in vertebrates and their significance in development?
Connection for AP® Courses
The information in this section is not within the scope of AP®. The formation of organs from embryonic germ layers results
from the expression of specific sets of genes that determine cell type. Organogenesis has been studied in the laboratory
using the fruit fly (Drosophila) and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In vertebrates, one of the primary steps during
organogenesis is the formation of the neural system from embryonic ectoderm. Formation of body axes (lateral-medial,
dorsal-ventral, and anterior-posterior) is another important developmental stage under genetic control.
