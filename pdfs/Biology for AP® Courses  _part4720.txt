is a major difference between the previous mass extinctions and the current extinction
we are experiencing: human activity. Specifically, three human activities have a major impact: destruction of habitat,
introduction of exotic species, and over-harvesting. Predictions of species loss within the next century, a tiny amount of
time on geological timescales, range from 10 percent to 50 percent. Extinctions on this scale have only happened five other
times in the history of the planet, and they have been caused by cataclysmic events that changed the course of the history of
life in each instance. Earth is now in one of those times.
Types of Biodiversity
Scientists generally accept that the term biodiversity describes the number and kinds of species in a location or on the planet.
Species can be difficult to define, but most biologists still feel comfortable with the concept and are able to identify and
count eukaryotic species in most contexts. Biologists have also identified alternate m
