 spectrum to 
which waves A and B belong.
 6.86  The watt is the derived SI unit of power, the measure of 
energy per unit time: 1 W = 1 J>s. A semiconductor laser in a 
CD player has an output wavelength of 780 nm and a power 
level of 0.10 mW. How many photons strike the CD surface 
during the playing of a CD 69 minutes in length?
 
6.87  Carotenoids are yellow, orange, and 
 
red pigments synthesized by plants. The 
observed color of an object is not the 
color of light it absorbs but rather the 
complementary color, as described by a 
color wheel such as the one shown here. 
On this wheel, complementary colors 
are across from each other. (a) Based on 
this wheel, what color is absorbed most 
strongly if a plant is orange? (b) If a particular carotenoid absorbs 
photons at 455 nm, what is the energy of the photon?
 [6.88] In an experiment to study the photoelectric effect, a scientist 
measures the kinetic energy of ejected electrons as a function of 
the frequency of radiation hit
