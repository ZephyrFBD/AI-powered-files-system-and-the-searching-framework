is sort, be sure to include all objects that
gain or lose heat (within reason). For simplicity, we have ignored very small masses,
such as the thermometer and the stirrer, which will affect the energy balance only
very slightly.
Bomb Calorimeter
A bomb calorimeter is used to measure the thermal energy released when a
substance burns (including foods) to determine their Calorie content. A carefully
weighed sample of the substance, with an excess amount of oxygen, is placed in a
sealed container (the “bomb”). The bomb is placed in the water of the calorimeter
and a fine wire passing into the bomb is then heated to ignite the mixture.
The Calorie content of foods determined in this way can be unreliable because our
bodies may not metabolize all the available energy (which would be excreted).
Careful measurements and calculations need to take this into account.
