 to help students understand 
relationships within biological systems. 
In this unit the successful student should 
use visual representations to demonstrate 
understanding of how the properties of 
water allow it to play a major role in biological 
systems and to show the properties and 
structure of biological macromolecules.
In biology, an argument involves making 
a claim, supporting it with evidence, and 
providing reasoning to support the claim. 
Beginning in this unit and throughout the 
course, students should become proficient 
in argumentation by predicting the causes 
or effects of a change in, or disruption to, 
one or more components in a biological 
system. The instructional focus of this unit 
should be on describing the structure and 
function of biological macromolecules and 
describing the relationship between structure 
and function.
