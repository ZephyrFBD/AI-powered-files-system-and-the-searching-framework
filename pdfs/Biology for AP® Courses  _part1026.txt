Signaling Molecules
Produced by signaling cells and the subsequent binding to receptors in target cells, ligands act as chemical signals that travel
to the target cells to coordinate responses. The types of molecules that serve as ligands are incredibly varied and range from
small proteins to small ions like calcium (Ca2+).
Small Hydrophobic Ligands
Small hydrophobic ligands can directly diffuse through the plasma membrane and interact with internal receptors. Important
members of this class of ligands are the steroid hormones. Steroids are lipids that have a hydrocarbon skeleton with four
fused rings; different steroids have different fu
