iffer from that for the ground state (Fig. 28–6), although it is still
spherically symmetric. For 
the distributions are not spherically
symmetric as shown in Figs. 28–9b (for

).
Although the spatial distributions of the electron can be calculated for the
various states, it is difficult to measure them experimentally. Most of the experi-
mental information about atoms has come from a careful examination of the
emission spectra under various conditions as in Figs. 27–23 and 24–28.
[Chemists refer to atomic states, and especially the shape in space of their
probability distributions, as orbitals. Each atomic orbital is characterized by its
quantum numbers n,
and 
and can hold one or two electrons (

); s-orbitals 
are spherically symmetric, Figs. 28–6 and 28–9a;
p-orbitals 
can be dumbbell shaped with lobes, Fig. 28–9b, or donut shaped
if combining
