ygous carrier of the hemophilia allele (XHXh) because she does not have
hemophilia but she does have a male offspring who does have hemophilia.
(b) Individual III-14 is a heterozygous carrier of the hemophilia allele (XHXh) because her father has
hemophilia and all females inherit an X chromosome from their father. It is also clear that she is a
heterozygous carrier because she does not have hemophilia but she does have a male offspring who does
have hemophilia.
(c)
(d) Closely related individuals are more likely to share the same alleles. If two closely related individuals share
the same recessive alleles, their offspring would be more likely to express that recessive trait than two
individuals who are not as closely related and do not have the same recessive alleles.
12. (a) Because the trait is expressed in every generation, it could be an autosomal dominant trait. Since both sexes
can express the trait but only females can pass the trait to the next generation, the mode of inherita
