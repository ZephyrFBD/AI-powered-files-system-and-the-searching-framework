ers, and catalytic converters. The inside 
of the catalytic converter contains small particles of platinum 
group metals that are deposited onto a honeycomb-shaped struc-
tural ceramic. The ceramic is composed of the ionic solids alumina 
(Al2O3) coated onto cordierite (Mg2Al4Si5O18). Semiconducting ox-
ides are used for the oxygen sensor to monitor the air/fuel ratio in 
the exhaust gases, which is controlled by the engine control com-
puter that is based on silicon, a covalent network solid. Polymers 
are found in a motor vehicle too, with polyesters in seat covers and 
carpets, polycarbonate optical reflectors, and polypropylene in 
bumpers and car batteries.
