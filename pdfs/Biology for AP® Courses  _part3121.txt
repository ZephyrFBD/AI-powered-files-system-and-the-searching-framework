There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease, and treatment is focused on easing symptoms. One of the most commonly
prescribed drugs for Parkinson’s is L-DOPA, which is a chemical that is converted into dopamine by neurons in the
brain. This conversion increases the overall level of dopamine neurotransmission and can help compensate for the loss of
dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Other drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down dopamine.
