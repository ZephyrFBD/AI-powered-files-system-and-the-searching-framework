ace is preferentially transmitted or absorbed. You
can check this by rotating Polaroid sunglasses while looking through them at
a flat surface of a lake or road. Since most outdoor surfaces are horizontal,
Polaroid sunglasses are made with their axes vertical to eliminate the more
strongly reflected horizontal component, and thus reduce glare.

lenses overlap, with axes perpendicular,
almost no light passes through.
