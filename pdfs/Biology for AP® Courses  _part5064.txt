ho had the nerve to accuse Trump of collusion with
the Russians while sleeping with a Chinese spy called Christine Fang

Fang Fang plays the part of Bond’s inﬁltrator girlfriend which I’m

brainless Swalwell, lying back and thinking of China. The FBI
eventually warned Swalwell about Fang Fang which gave her time
