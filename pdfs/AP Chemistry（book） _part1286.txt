s reasonable that electrons in covalent bonds should 
be apportioned according to the relative electronegativities of the 
bonded atoms. Figure 8.8 (page 310) shows that Cl has an electro-
negativity of 3.0, while the electronegativity value of H is 2.1. The 
more electronegative Cl atom might therefore be expected to have 
roughly 3.0>13.0 + 2.12 = 0.59 of the electrical charge in the bond-
ing pair, whereas the H atom would have 2.1>13.0 + 2.12 = 0.41 of 
the charge. Because the bond consists of two electrons, the Cl atomâ€™s 
share is 0.59 * 2e = 1.18e, or 0.18e more than the neutral Cl atom. 
This gives rise to a partial negative charge of 0.18- on Cl and there-
fore a partial positive charge of 0.18+ on H. (Notice again that we 
place the plus and minus signs before the magnitude in writing oxida-
tion numbers and formal charges but after the magnitude in writing 
actual charges.)
The dipole moment of HCl gives an experimental measure of 
the partial charge on each atom. In Sample E
