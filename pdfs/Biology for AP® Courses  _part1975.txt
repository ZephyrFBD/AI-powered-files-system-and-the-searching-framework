nown for adaptive evolution.
Papers by Darwin and Wallace (Figure 18.3) presenting the idea of natural selection were read together in 1858 before the
Linnean Society in London. The following year Darwin’s book, On the Origin of Species, was published. His book outlined
in considerable detail his arguments for evolution by natural selection.

Demonstrations of evolution by natural selection are time consuming and difficult to obtain. One of the best examples has
been demonstrated in the very birds that helped to inspire Darwin’s theory: the Galápagos finches. Peter and Rosemary
Grant and their colleagues have studied Galápagos finch populations every year since 1976 and have provided important
demonstrations of natural selection. The Grants found changes from one generation to the next in the distribution of beak
