Proto-oncogenes are positive cell-cycle regulators. When mutated, proto-oncogenes can become oncogenes and cause
cancer. Overexpression of the oncogene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth. This is because oncogenes can alter
transcriptional activity, stability, or protein translation of another gene that directly or indirectly controls cell growth. An
example of an oncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc. Myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated
in Burkett’s Lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system. Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into cancerous
cells that continue to grow uncontrollably. High B-cell numbers can result in tumors that can interfere with normal bodily
function. Patients with Burkett’s lymphoma can develop tumors on their jaw or in their mouth that interfere with the ability
to eat.
Cancer and Epigenetic Alterations
Silencing genes through epigenetic mechanisms is also very common in cancer cell
