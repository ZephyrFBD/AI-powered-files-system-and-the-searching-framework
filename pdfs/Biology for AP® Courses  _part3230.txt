Figure 27.14 In the human ear, sound waves cause the stapes to press against the oval window. Vibrations travel
up the fluid-filled interior of the cochlea. The basilar membrane that lines the cochlea gets continuously thinner
toward the apex of the cochlea. Different thicknesses of membrane vibrate in response to different frequencies
of sound. Sound waves then exit through the round window. In the cross section of the cochlea (top right figure),
note that in addition to the upper canal and lower canal, the cochlea also has a middle canal. The organ of Corti
(bottom image) is the site of sound transduction. Movement of stereocilia on hair cells results in an action potential
that travels along the auditory nerve.
Cochlear implants can restore hearing in people who have a nonfunctional cochlea. The implant consists of
a microphone that picks up sound. A speech processor selects sounds in the range of human speech, and
a tra
