CHAPTER 17 Additional Aspects of Aqueous Equilibria
Buffer Capacity and pH Range
Two important characteristics of a buffer are its capacity and its effective pH range. Buffer 
capacity is the amount of acid or base the buffer can neutralize before the pH begins to 
change to an appreciable degree. The buffer capacity depends on the amount of acid and 
base used
