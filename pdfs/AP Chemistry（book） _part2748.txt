ity-Product 1Ksp2 Expressions
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to write an equilibrium-constant expression 
for the process by which CaF2 dissolves in water.
Plan We apply the general rules for writing an equilibrium- 
constant expression, excluding the solid reactant from the expres-
sion. We assume that the compound dissociates completely into 
its component ions:
CaF21s2 ∆ Ca2 +1aq2 + 2 F -1aq2
Solve The expression for Ksp is
Ksp = 3Ca2 +43F-42
Appendix D gives 3.9 * 10-11 for this Ksp.

Which of these expressions correctly expresses the solubility- 
product constant for Ag3PO4 in water?   
(a) 3Ag43PO44  
  (b) 3Ag+43PO4
3 -4  (c) 3Ag+433PO4
3 -4  
(d) 3Ag+43PO4

3 -43
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Give the solubility-product-constant expressions and Ksp 
values (from Appendix D) for (a) barium carbonate and  
(b) silver sulfate.
Solubility and Ksp
It is important to distinguish carefully between solubility and the solubility-product 
constant. The s
