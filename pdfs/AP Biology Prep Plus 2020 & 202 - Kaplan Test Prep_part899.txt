glucose, E. coli will preferentially utilize glucose, conserving the resources
necessary to produce β-galactosidase. However, when glucose is absent,
lactose will functionally induce the expression of β-galactosidase. What
does this most strongly suggest?
Lactose represses expression of the lac operon.
(A)
Lactose is suﬀicient to cause an increase in β-galactosidase.
(B)
Glucose decreases expression of the lac operon in the presence of
lactose.
(C)
The presence of glucose is necessary for β-galactosidase
production.
(D)

The phylogenetic tree above depicts five newly-discovered bacterial
species. The branch point separating species 1 and 2 from 3, 4, and 5 is
the presence of a gene for enzyme X, required for the metabolism of
glucose. The branch point separating species 1 from species 2, and
species 3 and 4 from species 5 is the presence of protein Y, a pump that
removes a certain antibiotic from cells. 
Which of the following findings, if true, would require the most extensive
re
