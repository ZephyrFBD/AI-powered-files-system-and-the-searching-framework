might be the perfect lifesaver. One
famous example is Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. His red nose was a random mutation, but under the right
conditions, it became the best nose to have. A more diverse population is more likely to survive and evolve when
things are constantly changing around them.
How did all this wonderful variation come about? Well, the simple answer is that random mutations are occurring all
the time. This can be because of errors by DNA polymerase, changes to DNA caused by transposons, or other types
of DNA damage. Either way, mutations create new variations and alleles.
However, just the occurrence of mutations does not account for the great amount of genetic variation in a
population. The mixing of genes through sexual reproduction also contributes to genetic variation. During meiosis,
crossing-over mixes alleles among homologous chromosomes, and independent assortment when chromosomes are
packaged further adds to the genetic uniqueness of each gamete.
