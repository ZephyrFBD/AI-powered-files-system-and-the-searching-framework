function. We can therefore calculate ∆H for any process as long as we find 
a route for which ∆H is known for each step. This means that a relatively 
small number of experimental measurements can be used to calculate ∆H 
for a vast number of reactions.
Hess’s law provides a useful means of calculating energy changes that are 
difficult to measure directly. For instance, it is impossible to measure directly 
the enthalpy for the combustion of carbon to form carbon monoxide. Combus-
tion of 1 mol of carbon with 0.5 mol of O2 produces both CO and CO2, leaving 
some carbon unreacted. However, solid carbon and carbon monoxide can both 
be completely burned in O2 to produce CO2. We can therefore use the enthalpy 
changes of these reactions to calculate the heat of combustion of carbon as 
illustrated in Sample Exercise 5.8.

The enthalpy of reaction for the combustion of C to CO2 is -393.5 kJ>mol C, and the enthalpy for the combust
