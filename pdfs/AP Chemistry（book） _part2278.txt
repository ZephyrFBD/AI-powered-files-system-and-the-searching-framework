mechanism diagrammed in Figure 14.23. Both ethylene and hydrogen are adsorbed 
on the metal surface. Upon adsorption, the H¬H bond of H2 breaks, leaving two 
H atoms initially bonded to the metal surface but relatively free to move. When a 
hydrogen encounters an adsorbed ethylene molecule, it can form a s bond to one 
of the carbon atoms, effectively destroying the C ¬C p bond and leaving an ethyl 
group 1C2H52 bonded to the surface via a metal-to-carbon s bond. This s bond is 
relatively weak, so when the other carbon atom also encounters a hydrogen atom, 
a sixth C ¬H s bond is readily formed, and an ethane molecule 1C2H62 is released
