isplayed here is dominance hierarchy. A
dominant female led the other salmon to work collectively to
locate the site where they were fry (young fish).
The behavior displayed here is agonistic behavior. A dominant
female led the others to the site where they had hatched.
Peter Berthold at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in
Germany has been studying migratory patterns in birds for more
than 30 years. Here is a description of one of his studies with birds
called blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla). He used three sets of birds for
the study.
Experimental Design:
Group I: Blackcaps captured while wintering in Britain and then
bred in Germany in an outdoor cage
Group II: The offspring of the birds captured in Britain; kept in
outdoor cages
Group III: Young birds collected from nests near the lab and then
raised in outdoor cages
In autumn during the migratory period, Berthold placed all three sets
of birds into large glass-covered, funnel-shaped cages lined with
carbon-coated paper. When
