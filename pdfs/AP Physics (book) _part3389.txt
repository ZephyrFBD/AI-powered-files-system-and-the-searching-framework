 age of objects less than about
60,000 years old. The amount of 
remaining in objects older than that is usually
too small to measure accurately, although new techniques are allowing detection
of even smaller amounts of 
pushing the time frame further back. On the other
hand, radioactive isotopes with longer half-lives can be used in certain circum-
stances to obtain the age of older objects. For example, the decay of 
because
of its long half-life of 
years, is useful in determining the ages of rocks
on a geologic time scale. When molten material on Earth long ago solidified into
rock as the temperature dropped, different compounds solidified according to the
melting points, and thus different compounds separated to some extent. Uranium
present in a material became fixed in position and the daughter nuclei that result
from the decay of uranium were also fixed in that position. Thus, by measuring
the amount of 
remaining in the material relative to the amount of daughter
nuclei, the ti
