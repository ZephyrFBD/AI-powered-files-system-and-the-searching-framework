n carriers.
d.
CoQ and cytochrome c covalently bind electrons
while NADH dehydrogenase and succinate
dehydrogenase are mobile electron carriers.
34. What accounts for the different number of ATP
molecules that are formed through cellular respiration?
Chapter 7 | Cellular Respiration
321
a.
Transport of NADH from cytosol to
mitochondria is an active process that decreases
the number of ATP produced.
b.
The ATPs produced are utilized in the
anaplerotic reactions that are used for the
replenishment of the intermediates.
c.
Most of the ATPâ€™s produced are rapidly used for
the phosphorylation of certain compounds found
in plants.
d.
A large number of ATP molecules are used in
the detoxification of xenobiotic compounds
produced during cellular respiration.
35. Which of the following best describes complex IV in
the electron transport chain?
a.
Complex IV consists of an oxygen molecule
held between the cytochrome and copper ions.
The electrons flowing finally reach the oxygen,
producing water.
