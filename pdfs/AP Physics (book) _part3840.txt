In Chapters 5 and 8 we examined the motion of objects, including circular and
rotational motion, from the outside, as observers fixed on the Earth. Sometimes
it is convenient to place ourselves (in theory, if not physically) into a reference
frame that is rotating. Let us examine the motion of objects from the point of
view, or frame of reference, of persons seated on a rotating platform such as a
merry-go-round. It looks to them as if the rest of the world is going around them.
But let us focus on what they observe when they place a tennis ball on the floor of
the rotating platform, which we assume is frictionless. If they put the ball down
gently, without giving it any push, they will observe that it accelerates from rest
and moves outward as shown in Fig. C–1a. According to Newton’s first law, an
object initially at rest should stay at rest if no net force acts on it. But, according
to the observers on the rotating platform, the ball starts moving even though
there is no net for
