6. The lactose operon in the bacterium E. coli is shown in the figure
below.
This operon, also called the lac operon, is an example of
negatively-controlled gene expression. When lactose is not
available, a repressor protein binds to the operator region and
reduces the transcription of the structural genes lacZ, lacY, and
lacA to very low levels. When lactose is present in the medium,
allolactose, a molecule generated by lactose metabolism, binds
the repressor and releases it from the operator region.
In a mutant strain of E. coli, a mutation in the operator region
prevents the binding of the repressor protein. Researchers insert a
wild type operator gene into the mutant cells using a plasmid.
Which of the following results will they most likely observe?
The bacterial cells cannot metabolize lactose.
(A)
The expression of the lac operon can only be induced by
lactose.

The bacterial cells will continu
