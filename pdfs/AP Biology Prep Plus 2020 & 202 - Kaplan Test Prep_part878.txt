mplate provided to reflect the evolutionary
relationships of the four species. (3 points)
Phylogenetic tree components (1 point for each species, 4 points maximum)
Here is a sample tree that would earn full credit:
Species A is the most distantly related species
Species B is equally related to the other species
Species C and D are the most closely related species (Note: C and D can be interchanged on the
tree due rotation about the branch point)
(c) Provide reasoning for the placement on the tree of the two species that
are most closely related and for the species that is most distantly related to
the others. (3 points)
Reasoning (1 point each, 2 points maximum)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Since the number of differences in nucleotides between Species C and D is 2,
which is the smallest difference on the table, Species C and D are the most
closely related. Therefore, the middle two branches on the phylogenetic tree
should be labeled Species C and D. Spec
