Experimentally, the S ¬ S ¬S angle in S8 is 108°, in good agree-
ment with this prediction. Interestingly, if S8 were a planar 
ring, it would have S ¬ S ¬S angles of 135°. Instead, the S8 ring 
puckers to accommodate the smaller angles dictated by sp3 
hybridization.
(c) The MOs of S2 are analogous to those of O2, although the MOs 
for S2 are constructed from the 3s and 3p atomic orbitals of 
sulfur. Further, S2 has the same number of valence electrons 
as O2. Thus, by analogy with O2, we expect S2 to have a bond 
order of 2 (a double bond) and to be paramagnetic with two 
unpaired electrons in the p*
3p molecular orbitals of S2.
(d) We are considering the reaction in which an S8 molecule falls 
apart into four S2 molecules. From parts (b) and (c), we see 
that S8 has S ¬ S single bonds and S2 has S “ S double bonds. 
During the reaction, therefore, we are breaking eight S ¬ S 
single bonds and forming four S “ S double bonds. We can 
estimate the enthalpy of the reaction by using Equ
