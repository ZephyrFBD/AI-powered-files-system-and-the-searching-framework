he genetic diversity of the surviving population.
The northern elephant seal population experienced a population bottleneck during the 1800s. By the 1890s,
hunting had reduced the number of northern elephant seals to less than 30 individuals. Protection of this species in
the 20th century resulted in an increase in their numbers, but they are not as diverse as the southern elephant seals,
which were not subjected to intense hunting in the 1800s.
Founder Effect
Another cause of genetic drift is the founder effect. The founder effect occurs when a few members of a larger
population start a new population. These few members of the larger population often have less genetic diversity
compared to the larger population or may be a nonrandom sample of the larger population. A model of the founder
effect is shown in Figure 20.2.

In Figure 20.2, there are two different alleles present (represented by black circles and gray squares) in roughly
equal frequen
