the cell decreases.
Various checkpoints during the cell cycle evaluate conditions to determine whether cell activities in preparation for
cell division should
continue. The G1 checkpoint during the G1 phase determines whether preparations should continue or if the cell
should enter the G0 state with no subsequent cell division. The G2 checkpoint during the G2
phase checks for accurate DNA replication. The M checkpoint during metaphase insures that the chromosomes are
properly attached to the spindle fiber microtubules.
Cell division also depends on the presence of cyclin-dependent kinases, which activate, by phosphorylation, proteins
that regulate the cell cycle. Cell division is influenced by the detection of external molecules, or growth factors, that
are produced by other cells. Cell division is also promoted when neighboring cells are available for attachment
(anchorage dependence) or prevented by the presence of too many neighboring cells (density-dependent inhibition).
