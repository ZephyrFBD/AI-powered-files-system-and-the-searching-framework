occurring; this is a form of asexual reproduction. An example of parthenogenesis occurs in species in which the female lays
an egg and if the egg is fertilized, it is a diploid egg and the individual develops into a female; if the egg is not fertilized, it

remains a haploid egg and develops into a male. The unfertilized egg is called a parthenogenic, or virgin, egg. Some insects
and reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults.
Sexual reproduction requires two cells; when the haploid egg and sperm cells fuse, a diploid zygote results. The zygote
nucleus contains the genetic information to produce a new individual. However, early embryonic development requires the
cytoplasmic material contained in the egg cell. This idea forms the basis for reproductive cloning. Therefore, if the haploid
nucleus of an egg cell is replaced with a diploid nucleus from the cell of any individual of the same species (ca
