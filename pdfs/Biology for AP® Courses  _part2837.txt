cium stored in tissues. Osteoclasts are
usually found on the surface of the tissue.
Bone can be divided into two types: compact and spongy. Compact bone is found in the shaft (or diaphysis) of a long bone
and the surface of the flat bones, while spongy bone is found in the end (or epiphysis) of a long bone. Compact bone is
organized into subunits called osteons, as illustrated in Figure 24.15. A blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center
of the structure within the Haversian canal, with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae. The wavy lines
seen between the lacunae are microchannels called canaliculi; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells.
Spongy bone is made of tiny plates called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength. Over
time, these plates can break causing the bone to become less resilient. Bone tissue forms the internal skeleton of vertebrate
animals, providing structure to the animal and points of at
