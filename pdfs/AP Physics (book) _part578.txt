3. Apply Newton’s laws to determine unknown forces.
4. Find the work done by a specific force on the object by
using  
for a constant force. The work
done is negative when a force opposes the displacement.
5. To find the net work done on the object, either
(a) find the work done by each force and add the
results algebraically; or (b) find the net force on the
object,
and then use it to find the net work
done, which for constant net force is:
W
net = F

1. Draw a free-body diagram showing all the forces act-
ing on the object you choose to study.
2. Choose an xy coordinate system. If the object is in
motion, it may be convenient to choose one of the
coordinate directions as the direction of one of the
forces, or as the direction of motion. [Thus, for an
object on an incline, you might choose one coordinate
axis to be parallel to the incline.]
