es digestive juices. The chyme produced from the stomach is highly
acidic in nature; the pancreatic juices contain high levels of bicarbonate, an alkali that neutralizes the acidic chyme.
Additionally, the pancreatic juices contain a large variety of enzymes that are required for the digestion of protein and
carbohydrates.
The gallbladder is a small organ that aids the liver by storing bile and concentrating bile salts. When chyme containing
fatty acids enters the duodenum, the bile is secreted from the gallbladder into the duodenum.

the digestive systems of one invertebrate animal and one vertebrate animal. Explain how the organs of the
system promote efficiency in the use of matter and energy.
