 on grouping
organisms mainly by shared characteristics and does not necessarily illustrate how the various groups relate to each other
from an evolutionary perspective. For example, despite the fact that a hippopotamus resembles a pig more than a whale, the
hippopotamus may be the closest living relative of the whale.
20.2 | Determining Evolutionary Relationships
•
What is the difference between homologous and analogous traits? How are these traits used when determining
evolutionary relatedness?
•
What is cladistics? How does a cladogram differ from a phylogenetic tree?
•
What is parsimony?
Connection for AP® Courses
To build phylogenetic trees, scientists must collect accurate information that allows them to make evolutionary connections
among organisms. Using morphological and molecular data, scientists identify both homologous and analogous
characteristics and genes. (In a prior chapter we explored the differences between homologous and analogous traits and
how they relate to conve
