 2.108  Cyclopropane is an interesting hydrocarbon. Instead of hav-
ing three carbons in a row, the three carbons form a ring, as 
shown in this perspective drawing (see Figure 2.18  for a prior

 Cyclopropane was at one time used as an anesthetic, but its 
use was discontinued, in part because it is highly flammable. 
 
(a) What is the empirical formula of cyclopropane? How 
does it differ from that of propane? (b) The three carbon at-
oms are necessarily in a plane. What do the different wedges 
mean? (c) What change would you make to the structure 
shown to illustrate chlorocyclopr
