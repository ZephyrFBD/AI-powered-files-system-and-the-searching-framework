visibility. On the right, red blood cells in a small artery. A red blood cell travels about 
15 km a day inside our bodies and lives roughly 4 months before damage or rupture.
Humans contain 4 to 6 liters of blood, and 2 to 
red blood cells.

27–1 Discovery and Properties of
the Electron
Toward the end of the nineteenth century, studies were being done on the
discharge of electricity through rarefied gases. One apparatus, diagrammed in
Fig. 27–1, was a glass tube fitted with electrodes and evacuated so only a small
amount of gas remained inside. When a very high voltage was applied to the
electrodes, a dark space seemed to extend outward from the cathode (negative
electrode) toward the opposite end of the tube; and that far end of the tube would
glow. If one or more screens containing a small hole were inserted as shown,
the glow was restricted to a tiny spot on the end of the tube. It seemed as though
something be
