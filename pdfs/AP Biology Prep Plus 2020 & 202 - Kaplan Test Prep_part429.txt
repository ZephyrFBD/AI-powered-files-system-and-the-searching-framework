The diagram below depicts the portion of the inner mitochondrial
membrane with an ATP synthase embedded in it.
Using the slopes of the corrected diﬀerence lines, calculate the
diﬀerence in respiratory rate between germinating and non-
germinating peas at 10°C seventeen minutes aȇer the experiment
began. Give your answer to the nearest hundredth.
