OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION AND
CHEMIOSMOSIS
Most of the energy released during cell respiration occurs in the
mitochondria by a process known by the general name of oxidative
phosphorylation. This term means the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP

by the oxidation of the carrier molecules NADH and FADH2. This
energy-coupling mechanism was elucidated in 1961 by Peter Mitchell,
who named it chemiosmosis. According to the Mitchell hypothesis,
chemiosmosis uses potential energy stored in the form of a proton (H+)
gradient to phosphorylate ADP and produce ATP (ADP + P → ATP).
Important Points about Oxidative Phosphorylation
It is powered by the redox reactions of the electron transport chain.
Protons are pumped from the matrix to the outer compartment,
against a gradient, by the electron transport chain.
A proton gradient is created by a proton pump between the outer
compartment and the inner matrix.
