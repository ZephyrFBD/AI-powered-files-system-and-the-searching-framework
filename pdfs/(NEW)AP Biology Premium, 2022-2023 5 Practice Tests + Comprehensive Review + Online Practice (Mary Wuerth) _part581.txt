Just as a ball on a hill will move from an area of higher potential energy to an area of lower potential energy, water
will move from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential. Water potential can be defined
as the potential energy of water in a solution or the ability of water to do work. The more water there is in a solution,
the higher its water potential will be. The less water there is in a solution, the lower its water potential will be. Water
potential measures the tendency of water to move from one place to another. Water potential is a result of the effects
of both pressure potential (ψp) and solute potential (ψs), as shown in the following equation:
Most living systems are open to the atmosphere and are in pressure equilibrium with their environment. In these
cases, the pressure potential is zero, and the total water potential is due solely to the solute potential.
As solute is added to a solution, the relative amou
