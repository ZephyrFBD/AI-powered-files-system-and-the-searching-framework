ations that are stable, with
little or no population growth (zero population growth, or ZPG).

5. Survivorship curves describe how mortality of individuals in a species varies during their lifetimes (Figure 16-
2):
 
Type 1 curves describe species in which most individuals survive to middle age. After that age, mortality is high.
Humans exhibit type I survivorship.
Type II curves describe organisms in which the length of survivorship is random, that is, the likelihood of death is
the same at any age. Many rodents and certain invertebrates (such as Hydra) are examples.
Type III curves describe species in which most individuals die young, with only a relative few surviving to
reproductive age and beyond. Type III survivorship is typical of oysters and other species that produce free-
swimming larvae that make up a component of marine plankton. Only those few larvae that survive being eaten
become adults.
The following terms are used to describe population growth:
