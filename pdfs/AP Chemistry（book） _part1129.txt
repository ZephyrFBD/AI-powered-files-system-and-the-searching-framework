n of an alkali metal hydroxide:
 
2 M1s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡ 2 MOH1aq2 + H21g2 
[7.18]
These reactions are very exothermic (Figure 7.21). In many cases, enough heat 
is generated to ignite the H2, producing a fire or sometimes even an explosion, as in 
the case of K reacting with water. The reaction is even more violent for Rb and, espe-
cially, Cs, because their ionization energies are even lower than that of K.

than potassium metal?
