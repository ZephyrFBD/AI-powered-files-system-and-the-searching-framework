B. Evaluate these data to approximately predict the
quantitative effect on the NPP and free energy availability
in a deciduous forest ecosystem with a 3–5-°C increase in
temperature. This is the expected temperature increase by
the year 2100. Assume the current average summer
temperature of the forest ecosystem is 25 °C.
In other experiments, rather than returning the plants to 25
°C, the plant is grown for several days at a constant higher

temperature. Under these conditions, the maximum
photosynthetic rate shifts towards the temperature of the
new growing conditions. However, there is little change in
the temperature dependence of respiration rate. This is
referred to as temperature acclimation, an effect of great
importance to predictions of future climate change.
C. Pose two scientific questions whose pursuit could lead
to either an improved understanding of the mechanisms of
temperature
