e expected number of 
each phenotype rather than observed.
(C)

Signal 
Transduction
(A) 
Incorrect. Investigating receptors would not provide direction 
information about the signaling molecules themselves.
(B) 
Correct. Bacteria species likely have similarly structured signaling 
molecules as a result of common ancestry.
(C) 
Incorrect. The function of the molecule is not necessarily related to 
its structure. A variety of different molecules can evolve to perform a 
similar function.
(D) 
Incorrect. A common anc
