minimizes water loss through transpiration. A waxy cuticle covers the surface of all plant species to reduce the rate of water
loss from the leaf surface. Other leaves may have small hairs called trichomes on the leaf surface; not only do trichomes
also help reduce water loss; they also protect the leaf from herbivory by restricting insect movements or by storing toxic or
bad-tasting chemicals.
