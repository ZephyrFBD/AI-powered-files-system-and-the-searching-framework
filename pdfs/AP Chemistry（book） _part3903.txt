ch as multiple bonds or bonds with an 
atom of high electronegativity) tend to be the sites of reactivity in 
an organic compound. These sites of reactivity are called functional 
groups.
INTRODUCTION TO HYDROCARBONS (SECTION 24.2) The sim-
plest types of organic compounds are hydrocarbons, those composed 
of only carbon and hydrogen. There are four major kinds of hydrocar-
bons: alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Alkanes 
are composed of only C ¬H and C ¬C single bonds. Alkenes contain 
one or more carbon–carbon double bonds. Alkynes contain one or 
more carbon–carbon triple bonds. Aromatic hydrocarbons contain cy-
clic arrangements of carbon atoms bonded through both s and delo-
calized p bonds. Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons; the others are 
unsaturated.
Alkanes may form straight-chain, branched-chain, and cyclic 
arrangements. Isomers are substances that possess the same molec-
ular formula but differ in the arrangements of atoms. In structural 
isomers, the
