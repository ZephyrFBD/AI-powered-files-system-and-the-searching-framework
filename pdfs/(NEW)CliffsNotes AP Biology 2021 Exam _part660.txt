 potential is the maximum growth rate of a population under ideal conditions, with unlimited resources
and without any growth restrictions. For example, some bacteria can divide every 20 minutes. At that rate, one
bacterium could give rise to over a trillion bacteria in 10 hours. In contrast, elephants require nearly two years for
gestation of a single infant. Even at this rate, however, after 2,000 years, the weight of the descendants from two
mating elephants would exceed that of the earth. The following factors contribute to the biotic potential of a species:
Age at reproductive maturity
Clutch size (number of offspring produced at each reproductive event)
Frequency of reproduction
Reproductive lifetime
Survivorship of offspring to reproductive maturity

2. The carrying capacity is the maximum number of individuals of a population that can be sustained by a
particular habitat.
3. Limiting factors are those elements that prevent a population from attaining its biotic poten
