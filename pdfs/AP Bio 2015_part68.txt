30. Comparison of DNA sequences in Table II
suggests that a functional GULO gene in lemurs
can have a G, C, or T at position 21 but only a G
at position 22. Which of the following pairs of
predictions is most helpful in explaining the
discrepancy?
A substitution at 
position 21 would 
result in 
A substitution at 
position 22 would 
result in 
(A) 
No change to the 
protein 
A premature stop 
codon or an amino 
acid with different 
biochemical 
characteristics 
(B) 
A different amino 
acid 
A premature stop 
codon or an amino 
acid with different 
biochemical 
characteristics 
(C) 
No change to the 
protein 
A frame shift
