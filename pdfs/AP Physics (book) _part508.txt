n inertial reference frame (the elevator itself
is not now an inertial frame) we have
Solving for w, we have
We have chosen the positive direction up. Thus, if the acceleration a is up, a is
positive; and the scale, which measures w, will read more than mg. We call w the
apparent weight of the bag, which in this case would be greater than its actual
weight (mg). If the elevator accelerates downward, a will be negative and w, the
apparent weight, will be less than mg. The direction of the velocity 
doesn’t
matter. Only the direction of the acceleration 
(and its magnitude) influences
the scale reading.
Suppose the elevator’s acceleration is 
upward; then we find
That is, the scale reads 
times the actual weight of the bag (Fig. 5–24b). The
apparent weight of the bag is 
times its real weight. The same is true of the per-
son: her apparent weight (equal to the normal force exerted on her by the elevator
floor) is 
times her real weight. We can say that she is experiencing 
g’s, just 
as
