s the hill
and valley shown in Fig. 5–34. Both the hill and valley
have a radius of curvature R. At which point, A, B, or C,
is the normal force acting on the car (a) the largest,
(b) the smallest? Explain. (c) Where would the driver 
feel heaviest and (d) lightest? Explain. (e) How fast can
the car go without losing contact with the road at A?
11. Can a particle with constant speed be accelerating? What if
it has constant velocity? Explain.
12. Why do airplanes bank when they turn? How would you
compute the banking angle given the airspeed and radius
of the turn? [Hint: Assume an aerodynamic “lift” force
acts perpendicular to the wings. See also Example 5–7.]
9. Astronauts who spend long periods in outer space could be
adversely affected by weightlessness. One way to simulate
gravity is to shape the spaceship like a cylindrical shell that
rotates, with the astronauts
walking on the inside surface
(Fig. 5–33). Explain how
this simulates gravity.
Consider (a) how objects
fall, (b) the f
