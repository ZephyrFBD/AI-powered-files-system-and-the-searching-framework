 to each other. The two strands
of the helix run opposite each other; one runs 3′ to 5′, and the other
runs 5′ to 3′. A bonds with T; C bonds with G. Eliminate choice B
because the bases are identical in the two strands, not
complementary. Eliminate choice C because U (Uracil) is found
only in RNA, not DNA. Eliminate choice D because the two strands
both run 5′ to 3′. (IST-1)
(B) Monomers are combined by dehydration synthesis or
condensation, in which a molecule of water is removed. (SYI-1)
(B) An atom of hydrogen consists of one proton (+) in the nucleus
and 1 electron (–) in orbit around the nucleus. (SYI-1)
(A) The drop of water beads up, while the drop of alcohol does not.
The reason is that the molecules of water are strongly attracted to
each other by hydrogen bonding and also because water molecules
are strongly polar—the negative side of one water molecule attracts
the positive side of an adjacent water molecule. These strong
intermolecular attractions result in water having st
