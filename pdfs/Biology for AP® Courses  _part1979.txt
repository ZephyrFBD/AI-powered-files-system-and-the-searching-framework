 in a
way that gives it reduced fitness—lower likelihood of survival or fewer offspring. Alternatively, a mutation may produce a
phenotype with a beneficial effect on fitness. And, many mutations will also have no effect on the fitness of the phenotype;
these are called neutral mutations. Mutations may also have a whole range of effect sizes on the fitness of the organism that
expresses them in their phenotype, from a small effect to a great effect. Sexual reproduction also leads to genetic diversity:
when two parents reproduce, unique combinations of alleles assemble to produce the unique genotypes and thus phenotypes
in each of the offspring.
A heritable trait that helps the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an adaptation.
Scientists describe groups of organisms becoming adapted to their environment when a change in the range of genetic
variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the “fit” of the population to its environment. Th
