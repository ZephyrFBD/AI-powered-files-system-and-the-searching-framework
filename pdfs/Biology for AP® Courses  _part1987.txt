 living in the arctic region have been selected for seasonal
white phenotypes during winter to blend with the snow and ice (Figure 18.8ab). These similarities occur not because of
common ancestry, but because of similar selection pressures—the benefits of not being seen by predators.

Embryology, the study of the development of the anatomy of an organism to its adult form, also provides evidence
of relatedness between now widely divergent groups of organisms. Mutational tweaking in the embryo can have such
magnified consequences in the adult that embryo formation tends to be conserved. As a result, structures that are absent
in some groups often appear in their embryonic forms and disappear by the time the adult or juvenile form is reached. For
example, all vertebrate embryos, including humans, exhibit gill sli
