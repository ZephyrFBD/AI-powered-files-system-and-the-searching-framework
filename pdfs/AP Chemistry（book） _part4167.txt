the same, but they 
have opposite signs. page 275 No. The oxidation state of As will 
be positive when combined with Cl, and negative when combined 
with Mg. page 277 Because the melting point is so low, we would 
expect a molecular rather than ionic compound. Thus, A is more 
likely to be P than Sc because PCl3 is a compound of two nonmet-
als and is therefore more likely to be molecular. page 280 Its low 
first ionization energy. page 283 In the acidic environment of the 
stomach, metal carbonates can react to give carbonic acid, which 
decomposes to water and carbon dioxide gas. Thus, calcium car-
bonate is much more soluble in acidic solution than it is in neutral 
water. page 285 (b) The fact that bromine is a liquid and chlo-
rine is a gas. page 286 Based on the trends in the table, we might 
expect the radius to be about 1.5 Å, and the first ionization energy to 
be about 900 kJ>mol. In fact, its bonding radius is indeed 1.5 Å, and 
the experimental ionization energy is 920 kJ>m
