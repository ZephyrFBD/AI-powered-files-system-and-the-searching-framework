respiration, energy is released from glucose, and that energy is used to help make adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Plants
synthesize glucose using carbon dioxide and water, and glucose in turn is used for energy requirements for the plant. Excess
glucose is often stored as starch that is catabolized (the breakdown of larger molecules by cells) by humans and other
animals that feed on plants.
Galactose (part of lactose, or milk sugar) and fructose (found in sucrose, in fruit) are other common monosaccharides.
Although glucose, galactose, and fructose all have the same chemical formula (C6H12O6), they differ structurally and
chemically (and are known as isomers) because of the different arrangement of functional groups around the asymmetric
carbon; all of these monosaccharides have more than one asymmetric carbon (Figure 3.6).
