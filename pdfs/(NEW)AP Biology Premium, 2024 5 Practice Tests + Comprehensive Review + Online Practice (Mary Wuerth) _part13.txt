Given a visual representation of a biological system, describe the interactions and relationships between the components
of the system

Know how to ask testable questions and how to design experiments and methods to test those questions
(Science Practice 3). You must be able to:
State the null hypothesis and design an experiment to test it
State the alternative hypothesis and design an experiment to test it
Identify the components of an experiment, including appropriate controls, the independent and dependent variables, and
experimental constants
Use experimental data to evaluate a hypothesis
Design a follow-up experiment

Show that you can represent data in an appropriate graph and that you can accurately describe that
data (Science Practice 4). You must be familiar with the uses of the following types of graphs:
Line graph
Bar graph
Histogram
Pie chart
Scatterplot
Box and whisker plot
