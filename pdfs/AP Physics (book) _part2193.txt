aces of a
magnet. The wire is at an angle
to the field (Fig. 20–13). The magnetic
field is approximately uniform at 0.90 T. We ignore the field beyond the pole
pieces. Determine the magnitude and direction of the force on the wire.
APPROACH We use Eq. 20–1,
SOLUTION The force F on the 12-cm length of wire within the uniform field B
is
We use right-hand-rule-2 to find the direction of 
Hold your right hand flat,
pointing your fingers in the direction of the current. Then bend your fingers
(maybe needing to rotate your hand) so they point along 
Fig. 20–13. Your
thumb then points into the page, which is thus the direction of the force F.
