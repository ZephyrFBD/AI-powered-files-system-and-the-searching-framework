 a variable 
that you choose. It is important for you to develop a few skills during this part of 
the investigation in order to carry out your own investigation. For the floating disk 
technique, the most challenging skill is getting the disks to sink. Don’t just watch 
someone do this; make sure you can get the disks to sink as well.

When immersed in water, oxygen bubbles are usually trapped in the air spaces of 
the spongy mesophyll in the plant leaf. By creating a vacuum in this experimental 
procedure, the air bubbles can be drawn out of the spongy mesophyll, and the 
space is refilled by the surrounding solution. This allows
