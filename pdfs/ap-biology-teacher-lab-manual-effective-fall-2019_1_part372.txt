■ Designing and Conducting Your Investigation 
What factors affect the rate of photosynthesis in living plants? 
1. Once you have mastered the floating disk technique, you will design an experiment 
to test another variable that might affect the rate of photosynthesis. Some ideas 
include the following, but don’t limit yourself to just these: 
•  What environmental variables might affect the net rate of photosynthesis? Why do 
you think they would affect it? How do you predict they would affect it? 
•  What features or variables of the plant leaves might affect the net rate of  
photosynthesis? How and why?  
•  Could the way you perform the procedure affect the outcome? If the outcome 
changes, does it mean the net rate of photosynthesis has changed? Why do you think 
that?
