ble quantities, it is desirable to have a sim-
ple method for estimating it. The value of Z in Equation 
7.1 is known exactly, so the challenge boils down to es-
timating the value of S. In the text, we  
estimated S very 
simply by assuming that each core  
electron contributes 
1.00 to S and the outer electrons contribute nothing. A 
more accurate approach was  
developed by John Slater 
(1900–1976), however, and we can use his  
approach if 
we limit ourselves to elements that do not have elec-
trons in d or f subshells.
Electrons for which the principal quantum 
number n is larger than the value of n for the electron 
of interest contribute 0 to the value of S. Electrons 
with the same value of n as the electron of interest 
contribute 0.35 to the value of S. Electrons that have 
principal quantum number n - 1 contribute 0.85, 
while those with even smaller values of n contribute 
1.00. For example, consider ﬂuorine, which has the 
ground-state electron conﬁguration 1s22s22p5. For
