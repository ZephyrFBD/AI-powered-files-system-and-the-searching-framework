s a maximum if the particle is moving in the
direction of the field.
(c) The force causes the particle to gain kinetic energy.
(d) The direction of the force is along the magnetic field.
(e) A magnetic field always exerts a force on a charged
particle.
13. Explain why a strong magnet held near a CRT television
screen (Section 17–10) causes the picture to become
distorted. Also, explain why the picture sometimes goes
completely black where the field is the strongest. [But
don’t risk damage to your TV by trying this.]
14. Suppose you have three iron rods, two of which are magne-
tized but the third is not. How would you determine which
two are the magnets without using any additional objects?
15. Can you set a resting electron into motion with a magnetic
field? With an electric field? Explain.
16. A charged particle is moving in a circle under the influence
of a uniform magnetic field. If an electric field that points
in the same direction as the magnetic field is turned on,
describe the
