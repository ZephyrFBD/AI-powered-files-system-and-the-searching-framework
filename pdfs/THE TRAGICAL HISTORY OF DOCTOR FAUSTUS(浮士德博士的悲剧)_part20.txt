FAUSTUS discovered in his study.
FAUSTUS. Now, Faustus, Must thou needs be damn'd, canst thou not
be sav'd. What boots it, then, to think on God or heaven? Away with such
vain fancies, and despair; Despair in God, and trust in Belzebub: Now, go
not backward,<43> Faustus; be resolute: Why<44> waver'st thou?  O,
something soundeth in mine ear, "Abjure this magic, turn to God again!"
Why, he loves thee not; The god thou serv'st is thine own appetite,
Wherein is fix'd the love of Belzebub: To him I'll build an altar and a
church, And offer lukewarm blood of new-born babes.
Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.
EVIL ANGEL. Go forward, Faustus, in that famous<45> art.
GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, leave that execrable art.
FAUSTUS. Contrition, prayer, repentance--what of<46> these?

GOOD ANGEL. O, they are means to bring thee unto heaven!
EVIL ANGEL. Rather illusions, fruits of lunacy,
