11. What is the function of a phosphatase?
a.
A phosphatase removes phosphorylated amino
acids from proteins.
b.
A phosphatase removes the phosphate group
from phosphorylated amino acid residues in a
protein.
c.
A phosphatase phosphorylates serine, threonine,
and tyrosine residues.
d.
A phosphatase degrades second messengers in
the cell.
12. How does NF-κB induce gene expression?
a.
A small, hydrophobic ligand binds to NF-κB,
activating it.
b.
NF-κB is phosphorylated and is then free to
enter the nucleus to bind DNA.
c.
NF-κB is a kinase that phosphorylates a
transcription factor that binds DNA and
promotes protein production.
d.
Phosphorylation of the inhibitor IκB dissociates
the complex between it and NF-κB, allowing
NF-κB to enter the nucleus and stimulate
transcription.
13. Apoptosis can occur in a cell under what conditions?
a.
when a cell is infected by a virus
b.
when a cell is damaged
c.
when a cell is no longer needed
d.
all of the above
