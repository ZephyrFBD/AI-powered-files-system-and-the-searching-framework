to produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone and
gonadotropin. Leptin cannot be released without
sufficient body fat.
b.
Adipose tissue releases thymosins needed to
produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone and
gonadotropin. Thymosins cannot be produced
without sufficient body fat.
c.
Adipose tissue releases leptin needed to produce
gonadotropin-releasing hormone and
gonadotropin. Leptins cannot be produced in the
absence of body fat.
d.
Adipose tissue releases leptin needed to produce
estrogens and progesterone. Leptin cannot be
released without sufficient body fat.
