a) the pH of the original buffer described in Sam-
ple Exercise 17.6 after the addition of 0.020 mol HCl and  
(b) the pH of the solution that would result from the addi-
tion of 0.020 mol HCl to 1.000 L of pure water.

Equilibrium Calculation: We now turn 
our attention to the equilibrium for the 
ionization of acetic acid, the relationship 
that determines the buffer pH:
CH3COOH1aq2 ∆ H+1aq2 + CH3COO-1aq2
Using the quantities of CH3COOH 
and CH3COO- remaining in the 
buffer after the reaction with strong 
base, we determine the pH using the 
Henderson–Hasselbalch equation. 
The volume of the solution is now 
1.000 L + 0.0050 L = 1.005 L due to 
addition of the NaOH solution:
pH = 4.74 + log 
0.320 mol>1.005 L
0.280 mol>1.005 L = 4.80

by adding 0.020 mol of Na
