▶Practice Exercise 2
For each of the following transitions, give the sign of ∆E and 
indicate whether a photon is emitted or absorbed. (a) n = 3 to 
n = 1 (b) n = 2 to n = 4

So nf = 2, and the photons seen by the detector are those emit-
ted when an electron transitions from the nf = 4 to the nf = 2 
state.

From the graph, we estimate the wavelength of the photon to 
be approximately 480 nm. Starting from the wavelength, it is 
easiest to estimate nf using Equation 6.4:

The Wave Behavior of Matter

Because de Broglie’s hypothesis is applicable to all matter, any object of mass m and 
velocity v would give rise to a characteristic matter wave. However, Equation 6.8 indi-
cates that the wavelength associated with an object of ordinary size, such as a golf ball, is 
so tiny as to be completely unobservabl
