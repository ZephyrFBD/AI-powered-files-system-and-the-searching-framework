other stars.

▲ Figure 21.12 Nuclear binding energies. The average binding energy per nucleon increases initially as 
the mass number increases and then decreases slowly. Because of these trends, fusion of light nuclei 
and fission of heavy nuclei are exothermic processes.
Give It Some Thought
Would fusing two stable nuclei that have mass numbers in the vicinity of 100 be an 
energy-releasing process?
21.7 ∣ Nuclear Power: Fission
Nuclear fission is the process used to generate energy in nuclear power plants. Over 11% 
of the electricity generated worldwide comes from nuclear power plants, though the per-
centage varies from one country to t
