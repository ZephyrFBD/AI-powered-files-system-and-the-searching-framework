ADP is “phosphorylated” to
make ATP.
You’re also expected to know the following two things for the AP Biology Exam:
Every NADH from glycolysis yields 1.5 ATP and all other NADH molecules yield 2.5 ATP.
Every FADH2 yields 1.5 ATP.
You will also want to make sure you remember the major steps of cell respiration, and the outcome of each step:
Photosynthesis vs. Cell Respiration
The photosynthesis reactions share some similarities with cell respiration. In both cases, ATP production is driven
by a proton gradient, and the proton gradient is created by an electron transport chain. In respiration, protons are
pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, and they return to the matrix through an ATP
synthase down their concentration gradient. In photosynthesis, protons are pumped from the stroma into the
thylakoids compartment, and they return to the stroma through an ATP synthase down their concentration gradient.
The Krebs cycle and the Calvin cycle are both series of rea
