llaries. Because this pressure
gradient exists, oxygen diffuses down its pressure gradient, moving out of the alveoli and entering the blood of the
capillaries where O2 binds to hemoglobin. At the same time, alveolar PCO2 is lower PALVO 2 = 40 mm Hg than blood
PCO2 = (45 mm Hg). CO2 diffuses down its pressure gradient, moving out of the capillaries and entering the alveoli.
Oxygen and carbon dioxide move independently of each other; they diffuse down their own pressure gradients. As blood
leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins, the venous PO2 = 100 mm Hg, whereas the venous PCO2 = 40 mm Hg. As
blood enters the systemic capillaries, the blood will lose oxygen and gain carbon dioxide because of the pressure difference
of the tissues and blood. In systemic capillaries, PO2 = 100 mm Hg, but in the tissue cells, PO2 = 40 mm Hg. This pressure
gradient drives the diffusion of oxygen out of the capillaries and into the tissue cells. At the same time, blood PCO2 = 40
mm Hg and systemic ti
