ments 
in the development of the periodic table.
 
7.2 ▶ Effective Nuclear Charge  
Understand the concept of effective nuclear 
charge, the force between the outer or 
valence electrons and the nucleus, and how 
it varies throughout the periodic table.
 
7.3 ▶ Sizes of Atoms and Ions Explore 
the relative sizes of atoms and ions, both of 
which follow trends that are related to their 
placement in the periodic table and the 
trends in effective nuclear charge.
 
7.4 ▶ Ionization Energy Learn that 
ionization energy is the energy required to 
remove one or more electrons from an atom. 
The periodic trends in ionization energy 
depend on variations in effective nuclear 
charge and atomic radii.
 
7.5 ▶ Electron Affinity Learn that electron 
affinity is the energy released when 
an electron is added to an atom and 
understand its periodic trends.
 
7.6 ▶ Metals, Nonmetals, and Metalloids  
Differentiate the physical and chemical 
properties of metals from those of 
nonmetals. The differe
