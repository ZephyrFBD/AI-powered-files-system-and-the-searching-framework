FIGURE 5;24 (a) A bag in an 
elevator at rest exerts a force on a
spring scale equal to its weight.
(b) In an elevator accelerating
upward at
the bag’s apparent
weight is
times larger than its 
true weight. (c) In a freely falling
elevator, the bag experiences
“weightlessness”: the scale reads
zero.

The “weightlessness” experienced by people in a satellite orbit close to the
Earth (Fig. 5–25) is the same apparent weightlessness experienced in a freely
falling elevator. It may seem strange, at first, to think of a satellite as freely falling.
But a satellite is indeed falling toward the Earth, as was shown in Fig. 5–23. The
force of gravity causes it to “fall” out of its natural straight-line path. The accel-
eration of the satellite must be the acceleration due to gravity at that point, because
the o
