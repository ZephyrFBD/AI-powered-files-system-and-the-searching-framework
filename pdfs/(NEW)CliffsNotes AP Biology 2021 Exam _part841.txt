roductivity is the sum of the net primary productivity (2,000 mg carbon fixed/L/day) and
the respiratory rate (1,000 mg carbon fixed/L/day), for a total of 3,000 mg carbon fixed/L/day.

Questions
1. A major factor influencing transpiration rate is temperature. The hotter the environment, the greater the kinetic
energy of water molecules, and that faster water molecules change from a liquid state to a gas state. Wind is also a
factor, as it removes moisture around the leaf and increases the water gradient, which increases the rate of movement
of water molecules from inside to the outside of the leaf. Leaf size is also a factor because it increases the surface
area from which water transpires.
2. The population size entered into the model was probably small, less than 50 individuals. When populations are
small, the effect of genetic drift, or changes in allele frequencies by chance, has a strong influence on allele
frequencies.
