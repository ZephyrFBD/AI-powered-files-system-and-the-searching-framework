 is a “silent”
mutation. However, if the mutation changes the amino acid sequence of
the protein, the result can range from an insignificant change to a lethal
change depending on where the alteration in amino acid sequence takes
place.
Frameshiƞ mutations involve a change in the reading frame of an mRNA.
Because ribosomes and tRNAs “read” the mRNA in sections of three
bases (codons), if a base is inserted or deleted due to faulty transcription
or a mutation in the actual DNA, the reading of the resulting mRNA will
shiȇ, and this is called a frameshiȇ mutation. Base insertions and
deletions, particularly toward the start of the protein’s amino acid
sequence, can render the remaining structure nonfunctional as almost
every amino acid along the sequence gets changed.
Nonsense mutations produce a premature termination of the polypeptide
chain by changing one of the codons to a stop codon. Beta-thalassemia is
a hereditary disease in which red blood cells are produced with little or
no func
