N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ¡ 2 NH31g2
(a) What is being oxidized, and what is being reduced? (b) 
Using the thermodynamic data in Appendix C, calculate 
the equilibrium constant for the process at room tempera-
ture. (c) Calculate the standard emf of the Haber process at 
room temperature.

In a galvanic cell the cathode is an Ag+11.00 M2>Ag1s2 
half-cell. The anode is a standard hydrogen electrode 
immersed in a buffer solution containing 0.10 M ben-
zoic acid 1C6H5COOH2 and 0.050 M sodium benzoate 
1C6H5COO-Na+2. The measured cell voltage is 1.030 V. 
What is the pKa of benzoic acid?
 20.113  Aqueous solutions of ammonia 1NH32 and bleach (active 
ingredient NaOCl) are sold as cleaning ﬂuids, but bottles 
of both of them warn: “Never mix ammonia and bleach, as 
toxic gases may be produced.” One of the toxic gases that 
can be produced is chloroamine, NH2Cl. (a) What is the 
oxidation number of chlorine in bleach? (b) What is the 
oxidation number of
