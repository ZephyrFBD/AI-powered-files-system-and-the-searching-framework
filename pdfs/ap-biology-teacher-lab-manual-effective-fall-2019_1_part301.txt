shapes, especially those involved with nutrient uptake; good examples include intestinal 
villi and root hair cells. Students should predict which measurement — surface area or 
volume — has the greater influence on the rate of diffusion. They should then calculate 
surface area-to-volume ratios and determine the diffusion depth and rate in agar. 
Materials 
• 2% agar containing the pH-  
indicator dye phenolphthalein  
• Squares of hard, thin plastic (from  
disposable plates); unserrated knives; or 
scalpels from dissection kits 
• 1% phenolphthalein solution 
• Metric rulers 
• 0.1M NaOH 
• Petri dishes or test tubes to hold the agar 
cubes 
• 0.1M HCl 
■ Preparation 
Wear safety goggles or glasses when preparing these materials. 
To prepare 2% agar with phenolphthalein, do the following: 
1. Dissolve 1 g phenolphthalein in 100 mL of 95% ethanol to make a 1% solution. 
2. Mix 20 g of agar with 1 L water; heat to near boiling or until solution is clear. 
3. Cool the agar to ~55°C and
