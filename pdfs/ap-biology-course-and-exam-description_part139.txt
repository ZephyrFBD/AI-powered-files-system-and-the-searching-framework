on a visual representation 
of a biological concept, 
process, or model.
TOPIC 4.4
Changes in Signal 
Transduction
Pathways
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
IST-3
Cells communicate by generating, transmitting, receiving, and responding to 
chemical signals.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-3.G
Explain how a change in the 
structure of any signaling 
molecule affects the activity 
of the signaling pathway.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-3.G.1
Changes in signal transduction pathways can 
alter cellular response—
a.  
Mutations in any domain of the receptor 
protein or in any component of the signaling 
pathway may affect the downstream 
components by altering the subsequent 
transduction of the signal.
IST-3.G.2
Chemicals that interfere with any component 
of the signaling pathway may activate or inhibit 
the pathway.
