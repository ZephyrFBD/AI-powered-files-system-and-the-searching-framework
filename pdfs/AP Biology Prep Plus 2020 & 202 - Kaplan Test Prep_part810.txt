tive ecosystem. Researchers introduced eight panthers
from Texas, members of a diﬀerent subspecies, to southern
Florida that year. Why would it be beneficial to introduce panthers
from another population to interbreed with the Florida panthers?
The existing small population was very inbred, increasing the
risk that they could go extinct due to a lack of genetic
diversity in the population.
(A)
Increasing the size of the population is very important for
survival, and subspecies are suﬀiciently similar that the
genetic diﬀerences did not matter.
(B)
Texas populations were likely better adapted to the southern
Florida habitat, and introducing their genes would increase
the survival of the population.
(C)
The population was so small that it was impossible to save,
making it a good location to experiment with interbreeding
panther subspecies.

researchers actively study wetland restoration methods. Figure A
