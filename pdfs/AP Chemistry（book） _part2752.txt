 no other important equilibria involving Ag+ or CrO4
2 - ions in the solution, calculate Ksp for this compound.
Sample Exercise 17.11 
Calculating Ksp from Solubility
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the equilibrium concentration of Ag+ in a 
saturated solution of Ag2CrO4 and asked to determine the value of 
Ksp for Ag2CrO4.
Plan The equilibrium equation and the expression for Ksp are
Ag2CrO41s2 âˆ† 2 Ag+1aq2 + CrO4
2 -1aq2
Ksp = 3Ag+423CrO4
2 -4
To calculate Ksp, we need the equilibrium concentrations of Ag+ and 
CrO4
2 -. We know that at equilibrium 3Ag+4 = 1.3 * 10-4 M. All 
the Ag+ and CrO4
2 - ions in the solution come from the Ag2CrO4 
that dissolves. Thus, we can use 3Ag+4 to calculate 3CrO4
2 -4.
Solve From the chemical formula of silver chromate, we know 
that there must be two Ag+ ions in solution for each CrO4
2 -  ion in 
solution. Consequently, the concentration of CrO4
2 -  is half the 
concentration of Ag+:
