style, medication, and
having children. Genomics is still in its infancy, although someday it may become routine to use whole-genome sequencing
to screen every newborn to detect genetic abnormalities.
In addition to disease and medicine, genomics can contribute to the development of novel enzymes that convert biomass
to biofuel, which results in higher crop and fuel production, and lower cost to the consumer. This knowledge should allow
better methods of control over the microbes that are used in the production of biofuels. Genomics could also improve the
methods used to monitor the impact of pollutants on ecosystems and help clean up environmental contaminants. Genomics
has allowed for the development of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals that could benefit medical science and agriculture.
It sounds great to have all the knowledge we can get from whole-genome sequencing; however, humans have a
responsibility to use this knowledge wisely. Otherwise, it could be easy to misuse the power
