2. When we eat salty foods, we absorb the salt from our digestive tract into our circulatory system. This causes a
shift away from homeostasis because it increases the osmolarity (solute concentration) of the blood and affects the
solute gradient between intercellular and cellular fluids. The hypothalamus detects this change in the blood and
secretes ADH, causing the kidneys to conserve water by concentrating urine. Meanwhile, the hypothalamus sends a
message of thirst to the brain.
Some Typical Answers to Long Questions
Question 1
a. There are two ways in which target cells recognize hormones. In cells that recognize steroid hormones, the
hormone diffuses through the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope and binds with special receptor proteins in the
cytoplasm or nucleus. These receptors then activate transcription of specific genes. If the hormone is a peptide, the
hormone binds to special receptor proteins on the
