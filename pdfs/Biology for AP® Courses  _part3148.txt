ormation superhighway that connects the brain with the
rest of the body through its connections with peripheral nerves. It transmits sensory and motor input and also controls
motor reflexes.
26.4 The Peripheral Nervous System
The peripheral nervous system contains both the autonomic and sensory-somatic nervous systems. The autonomic nervous
system provides unconscious control over visceral functions and has two divisions: the sympathetic and parasympathetic
nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations to prepare the animal for a “fight or
flight” response. The parasympathetic nervous system is active during restful periods. The sensory-somatic nervous
system is made of cranial and spinal nerves that transmit sensory information from skin and muscle to the CNS and motor
commands from the CNS to the muscles.
26.5 Nervous System Disorders
Some general themes emerge from the sampling of nervous system disorders presented above. The causes for most
