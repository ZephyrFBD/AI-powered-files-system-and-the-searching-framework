An important medical use of an RC circuit is the electronic heart pacemaker,
which can make a stopped heart start beating again by applying an electric stim-
ulus through electrodes attached to the chest. The stimulus can be repeated at the
normal heartbeat rate if necessary. The heart itself contains pacemaker cells,
which send out tiny electric pulses at a rate of 60 to 80 per minute. These signals
induce the start of each heartbeat. In some forms of heart disease, the natural
pacemaker fails to function properly, and the heart loses its beat. Such patients
use electronic pacemakers which produce a regular voltage pulse that starts and
controls the frequency of the heartbeat. The electrodes are implanted in or near
the heart (Fig.
