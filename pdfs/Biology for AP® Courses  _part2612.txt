xylem cells with thinner walls; they are shorter than tracheids. Each vessel element is connected to the next by means of a
perforation plate at the end walls of the element. Water moves through the perforation plates to travel up the plant.
Phloem tissue is composed of sieve-tube cells, companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibers. A series of sieve-
tube cells (also called sieve-tube elements) are arranged end to end to make up a long sieve tube, which transports organic
substances such as sugars and amino acids. The sugars flow from one sieve-tube cell to the next through perforated sieve
plates, which are found at the end junctions between two cells. Although still alive at maturity, the nucleus and other cell
components of the sieve-tube cells
