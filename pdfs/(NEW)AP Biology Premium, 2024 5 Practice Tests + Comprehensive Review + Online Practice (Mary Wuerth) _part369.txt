 multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. For example, the codons UCA, UCC,
UCG, and UCU all code for the amino acid serine. This gives redundancy to the genetic code. This redundancy in the genetic code may result
in “silent” mutations that do not affect the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide chain. Almost all organisms on Earth use the same genetic
code, which is evidence for the common ancestry of all organisms.
As Figure 16.4 shows, 61 of the 64 possible codons code for amino acids. Three of the 64 codons do not code for
amino acids and are stop codons.

TIP
You do not need to memorize any codons of the genetic code. If needed, a codon chart will be provided on the AP Biology exam. Codons are
specified here for illustrative purposes and clarity.
2. Elongation: After the first amino acid is placed in the ribosome by tRNA, the ribosome translocates (or
moves) to the next codon. A new tRNA with the appropriate anticodon and amino acid then pair
