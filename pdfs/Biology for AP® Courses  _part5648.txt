… And The Truth Shall Set You Free. For this reason the last thing the
Cult wants in circulation is the truth about anything – especially the
reality of the eternal ‘I’ – and that’s why it is desperate to control
information. The Cult knows that information becomes perception
which becomes behaviour which, collectively, becomes human
society. Cult-controlled and funded mainstream ‘science’ denies the
existence of an eternal ‘I’ and seeks to dismiss and trash all evidence
to the contrary. Cult-controlled mainstream religion has a version of
‘God’ that is liĴle more than a system of control and dictatorship
that employs threats of damnation in an aĞerlife to control
perceptions and behaviour in the here and now through fear and
guilt. Neither is true and it’s the ‘neither’ that the Cult wishes to
suppress. This ‘neither’ is that everything is an expression, a point of
aĴention, within an inﬁnite state of consciousness which is the real
meaning of the term ‘God’.
