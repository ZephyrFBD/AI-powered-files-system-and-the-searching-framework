hermic since its respiration rate at 30°C is closer to the respiration rate of the rat at 30°C
than to the respiration rate of the grasshopper at 30°C.
(D) Species X is endothermic since its respiration rate is higher at a higher environmental temperature.
10. This experiment is repeated with the same animals at a temperature of 37°C. Which of the following is the most
likely result?
(A) The rat will have a higher respiration rate than the grasshopper at 37°C because rats are ectothermic.
(B) The grasshopper will have a higher respiration rate than species X at 37°C because grasshoppers are
ectothermic and species X is endothermic.
(C) Species X will have a higher respiration rate than the rat at 37°C because rats are ectothermic and species
X is endothermic.
(D) The rat will have a lower respiration rate than both the grasshopper and species X at 37°C because rats are
endothermic and both grasshoppers and species X are ectothermic.
