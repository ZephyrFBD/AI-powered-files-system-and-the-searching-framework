Intact chloroplasts are isolated from dark-green leaves by low-speed
centrifugation and placed into six tubes that contain cold buffer. A
blue dye, DPIP, which turns clear when reduced, is also added to all
the tubes. The amount of decolorization is a function of how much
reduction and, therefore, how much photosynthesis occurs. Each
tube is exposed to different wavelengths of light. A measurement of
the amount of decolorization is made, and the data are plotted on a
graph. Although t
