Long before chromosomes were visualized under a microscope, the father of modern genetics, Gregor Mendel, began
studying heredity in 1843. With the improvement of microscopic techniques during the late 1800s, cell biologists could stain
and visualize subcellular structures with dyes and observe their actions during cell division and meiosis. With each mitotic
division, chromosomes replicated, condensed from an amorphous (no constant shape) nuclear mass into distinct X-shaped
bodies (pairs of identical sister chroma
