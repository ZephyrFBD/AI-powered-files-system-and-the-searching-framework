†To deal with the conceptual difficulty of “action at a distance,” the idea of a gravitational field was intro-
duced many years later: every object that has mass produces a gravitational field in space. The force
one object exerts on a second object is then due to the gravitational field produced by the first object at
the position of the second object. We discuss fields in Section 16–7.

FIGURE 5;17 The gravitational
force one object exerts on a second
object is directed toward the first
object; and, by Newton’s third law,
is equal and opposite to the force
exerted by the second object on the
first. In the case shown, the
gravitational force on the Moon 
due to Earth,
is equal and
opposite to the gravitational force
on Earth due to the Moon,
