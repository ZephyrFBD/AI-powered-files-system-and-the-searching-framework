enantiomers to make it identical to the other. Molecules or ions that are not super-
imposable on their mirror image are said to be chiral (pronounced KY-rul).
The properties of two optical isomers differ only if the isomers are in a chiral environ-
mentâ€”that is, an environment in which there is a sense of right- and left-handedness. 
 
A chiral enzyme, for example, might catalyze the reaction of one optical isomer but not 
the other. Consequently, one optical isomer may produce a specific physiological effect 
in the body, with its mirror image producing either a different effect or none at all. Chi-
ral reactions are also extremely important in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other 
industrially important chemicals.
Coordination-sphere isomers are isomers that differ in which species in 
the complex act as ligands, and which are outside the coordination sphere. For 
example, three isomers have the formula CrCl3(H2O)6. When the ligands are six 
H2O and the chloride ions are in th
