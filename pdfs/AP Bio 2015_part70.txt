that live in
other places (e.g., humans, chimpanzees, and
orangutans) have a GULO pseudogene and are
unable to produce ascorbic acid. Which of the
following best explains the genetic variation
among primate species?
(A) Food sources on the island of Madagascar
were deficient in ascorbic acid, which 
caused the primates to migrate to the 
mainland where ascorbic acidâ€“rich foods 
are more widely available. 
(B) Human activity on Madagascar, including 
poaching, drove the other primates into 
extinction on the island. 
(C) Food sources where non-Madagascar 
primates lived provided ample ascorbic acid 
in the diet, which removed the selective 
pressure for maintaining a functional GULO 
 
gene. 
(D) Food sources on the island of Madagascar 
were deficient in ascorbic acid, which 
caused lemurs to adapt by developing the 
ability to produce an active GULO protein.
