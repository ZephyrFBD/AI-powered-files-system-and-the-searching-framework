 the apex of
the arch due to the three forces exerted on that half arch. The torque equation
contains three terms: the weight above, the support 
below, and the
horizontal force 
which for the round arch (see Fig. 9–31a) is
Thus
for the round arch. For the pointed arch, the torque equa-
tion is (see Fig. 9–31b)
Solving, we find that
—only half as much as for the round arch!
From this calculation we can see that the horizontal buttressing force required
for a pointed arch is less because the arch is higher, and there is therefore a longer
lever arm for this force. Indeed, the steeper the arch, the less the horizontal 
component of the force needs to be, and hence the more nearly vertical is the 
force exerted at the base of the arch.
Whereas an arch spans a two-dimensional space, a dome—which is basically an
arch rotated about a vertical axis—spans a three-dimensional space. The Romans
built the first large domes. Their shape was hemispherical and some still stand, such
as that of the P
