spheres together without leaving some void spaces between the spheres. Packing efficiency is the 
fraction of space in a crystal that is actually occupied by atoms. Determine the packing efficiency of a face-centered cubic metal.
Sample Exercise 12.1 
Calculating Packing Efficiency
SOLUTION
Analyze We must determine the volume taken up by the atoms 
that reside in the unit cell and divide this number by the volume 
of the unit cell.
Plan We can calculate the volume taken up by atoms by multiply-
ing the number of atoms per unit cell by the volume of a sphere, 
4pr3>3. To determine the volume of the unit cell, we must first 
identify the direction along which the atoms touch each other. 
We can then use geometry to express the length of the cubic unit 
cell edge, a, in terms of the radius of the atoms. Once we know the 
edge length, the cell volume is simply a3.
Solve As shown in Figure 12.12, a face-centered cubic metal has 
four atoms per unit cell. Therefore, the volume occupied by t
