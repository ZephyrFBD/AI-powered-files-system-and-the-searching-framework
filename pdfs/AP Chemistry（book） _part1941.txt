h the polymer, like tiny “meatballs” in the polymer “spaghetti.” 
When sulfide is added, CdS particles grow, but the polymer keeps them from forming 
large crystals. A great deal of fine-tuning of reaction conditions is necessary to produce 
nanocrystals that are of uniform size and shape.
As we learned in Section 12.7, some semiconductor devices can emit light when 
a voltage is applied. Another way to make semiconductors emit light is to illuminate

them with light whose photons have energies larger than the energy of the band gap of 
the semiconductor, a process called photoluminescence. A valence-band electron absorbs 
a photon and is promoted to the conduction band. If the excited electron then falls 
back down into the hole it left in the valence band, it emits a photon having energy 
equal to the band gap energy. In the case of quantum dots, th
