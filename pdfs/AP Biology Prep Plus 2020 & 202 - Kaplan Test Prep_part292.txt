mnosperm tissues provide more opportunities for filtration than
angiosperm tissues with the same stem length. (B) is thus correct. (A)
is incorrect because there is less passage through pores due to the
smaller number of cells in angiosperm vascular tissue, so there would
be less filtration. (C) is incorrect because the path followed by the
water (and the number of pores it passes through) matters more than
the distance traveled. (D) is incorrect because monocots and dicots are
both angiosperms with only slight diﬀerences in vascular tissue.

The mechanism in (B) would allow the plant to sense blue light as
distinct from other colors and also produce a change in gene
expression. (A) is incorrect because it does not explain how light
changes gene expression. (C) is incorrect because it does not mention
how the plant would sense changes in kinetic energy. In addition, blue
light has more energy than other colors of visible light and is therefore
not cooler. Li
