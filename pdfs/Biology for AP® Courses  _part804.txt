 (the enzyme in this case is named for the
reverse reaction of pyruvateâ€™s conversion into PEP) and results in the production of a second ATP molecule by substrate-
level phosphorylation and the compound pyruvic acid (or its salt form, pyruvate). Many enzymes in enzymatic pathways
are named for the reverse reactions, since the enzyme can catalyze both forward and reverse reactions (these may have been
described initially by the reverse reaction that takes place in vitro, under non-physiological conditions).

Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of nearly every cell. Organisms, from the small, circular colonies of
bacteria pictured here to the human holding the petri dish, perform glycolysis using the same ten enzymes.
Because of this, it is thought that glycolysis must have evolved in the ve
