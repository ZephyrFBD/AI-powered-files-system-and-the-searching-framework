Vertebrate Axis Formation
Even as the germ layers form, the ball of cells still retains its spherical shape. However, animal bodies have lateral-medial
(left-right), dorsal-ventral (back-belly), and anterior-posterior (head-feet) axes, illustrated in Figure 34.27.

How are these established? In one of the most seminal experiments ever to be carried out in developmental biology,
Spemann and Mangold took dorsal cells from one embryo and transplanted them into the belly region of another embryo.
They found that the transplanted embryo now had two notochords: one at the dorsal site from the original cells and another
at the transplanted site. This suggested that the dorsal cells were genetically programmed to form the notochord and define
the axis. Since then, researchers have identified many genes that a
