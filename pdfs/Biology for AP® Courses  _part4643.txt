the primary
consumers, thus, minimizing their biomass at any particular point in time. However, phytoplankton reproduce quickly, thus
they are able to support the rest of the ecosystem.
Pyramid ecosystem modeling can also be used to show energy flow through the trophic levels. Notice that these numbers

are the same as those used in the energy flow compartment diagram in Figure 37.8. Pyramids of energy are always upright,
and an ecosystem without sufficient primary productivity cannot be supported. All types of ecological pyramids are useful
for characterizing ecosystem structure. However, in the study of energy flow through the ecosystem, pyramids of energy are
the most consistent and representative models of ecosystem structure (Figure 37.10).
Figure 37.10 Ecological pyramids depict the (a) biomass, (b) number of organisms, and (c) energy in each trophic
level.
