y treating the acid as if it were a monoprotic acid.
Solve
Proceeding as in Sample Exercises 16.12 and 
16.13, we can write the equilibrium reaction 
and equilibrium concentrations as:
We see that the value for y is indeed very small compared with 
4.0 * 10-5, showing that our assumption was justified. It also 
shows that the ionization of HCO3
- is negligible relative to that of 
H2CO3, as far as production of H+ is concerned. However, it is the 
only source of CO3
2-, which has a very low concentration in the 
solution. Our calculations thus tell us that in a solution of carbon 
dioxide in water, most of the CO2 is in the form of CO2 or H2CO3, 
only a small fraction ionizes to form H+ and HCO3
-, and an even 
smaller fraction ionizes to give CO3
2-. Notice also that 3CO3
2-4 is 
numerically equal to Ka2.
