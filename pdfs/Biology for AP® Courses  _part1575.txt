by electrophoresis on the basis of size.
The DNA sequence can be read out on an
electropherogram generated by a laser scanner.
c.
Frederick Sanger’s sequencing is a chain
termination method that is used to generate
DNA fragments that terminate at different points
using dye-labeled dideoxynucleotides. DNA is
joined together by electrophoresis on the basis of
size. The DNA sequence can be read out on an
electropherogram generated by a laser scanner.
d.
Frederick Sanger’s sequencing is a chain
termination method that is used to generate
DNA fragments that terminate at different points
using dye-labeled dideoxynucleotides. DNA is
separated by electrophoresis on the basis of size.
The DNA sequence can be read out on an
electropherogram generated by a magnetic
scanner.
