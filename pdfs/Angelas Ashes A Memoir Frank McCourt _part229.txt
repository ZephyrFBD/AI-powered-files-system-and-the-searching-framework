h their heads down, 
 
 their mouths moving.Malachy says he’s hungry and he wants some, too. 
 
 Dad says, Shush, that’s Holy Communion, the body and blood of Our 
 
 Lord. 
 
 But, Dad. 
 
 Shush, it’s a mystery. 
 
 There’s no use asking more questions. If you ask a question they tell 
 
 you it’s a mystery, you’ll understand when you grow up, be a good boy, 
 
 ask your mother, ask your father, for the love o’ Jesus leave me alone, go 
 
 out and play. 
 
 Dad gets his first job in Limerick at the cement factory and Mam 
 
 is happy. She won’t have to stand in the queue at the St.Vincent de 
 
 Paul Society asking for clothes and boots for Malachy and me. She says 
 
 it’s not begging, it’s charity, but Dad says it’s begging and shameful. 
 
 Mam says she can now pay off the few pounds she owes at Kathleen 
 
 O’Connell’s shop and she can pay back what she owes her own 
 
  
  
 mother. She hates to be under obligation to anyone, especially her own 
 
 mother.
