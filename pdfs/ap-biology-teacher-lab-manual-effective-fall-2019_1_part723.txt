e. 
Step 2 Calculate the rate of transpiration/surface area.  If you are using a gas pressure 
sensor to collect data, you can express these rate values as kPa/min/cm2, where kPa 
(kilopascal) is a unit of pressure. Record the rate. 
Step 3 After the entire class agrees on an appropriate control, subtract the control rate 
from the experimental value. Record this adjusted rate. 
Step 4 Record the adjusted rate for your experimental test on the board to share with 
other lab groups. Record the class results for each of the environmental variables 
investigated. 
Step 5 Graph the class results to show the effects of different environmental variables on 
the rate of transpiration. You may need to convert data to scientific notation with all 
numbers reported to the same power of 10 for graphing purposes. 
Step 6 Your teacher may suggest you perform statistical analysis (e.g., a T-test) of your 
data, comparing results of experimental variable(s) to controls.
