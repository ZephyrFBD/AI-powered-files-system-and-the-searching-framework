vasectomy in males in that the oviducts are severed and sealed.
The uterus is a structure about the size of a womanâ€™s fist. This is lined with an endometrium rich in blood vessels and
mucus glands. The uterus supports the developing embryo and fetus during gestation. The thickest portion of the wall of
the uterus is made of smooth muscle. Contractions of the smooth muscle in the uterus aid in passing the baby through the
vagina during labor. A portion of the lining of the uterus sloughs off during each menstrual period, and then builds up again
in preparation for an implantation. Part of the uterus, called the cervix, protrudes into the top of the vagina. The cervix
functions as the birth canal.
The vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes. It allows menstrual flow to leave the body. It is the receptacle
for the penis during intercourse and the vessel for the delivery of offspring. It is lined by stratified squamous epithelial cells
to protect the underlying tissue.
