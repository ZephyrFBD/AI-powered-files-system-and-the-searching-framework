observable universe, superimposed on ours, is suggested by Fig. 33–28.
The edge of our observable universe is called the horizon. We could, in
principle, see as far as the horizon, but not beyond it. An observer in another
galaxy, far from us, will have a different horizon.
33–7 The Standard Cosmological Model:
Early History of the Universe
In the last decade or two, a convincing theory of the origin and evolution of the
universe has been developed, now called the Standard Cosmological Model. Part
of this theory is based on recent theoretical and experimental advances in ele-
mentary particle physics, and part from observations of the universe including
COBE, WMAP, and Planck. Indeed, cosmology and elementary particle physics
have cross-fertilized to a surprising extent.
Let us go back to the earliest of times—as close as possible to the Big
Bang—and follow a Standard Model theoretical scenario of events as the universe
expanded and cooled after the Big Bang. Initially we talk of extre
