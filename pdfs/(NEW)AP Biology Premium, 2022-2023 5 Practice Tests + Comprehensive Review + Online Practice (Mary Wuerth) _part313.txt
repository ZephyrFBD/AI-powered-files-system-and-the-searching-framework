o be
homozygous recessive (rr), so choice (D) is incorrect.
4. (C) A genotype of ss would result in the constricted pod phenotype. Choices (A) and (B) are incorrect because
both SS and Ss would result in the smooth phenotype. Choice (D) is incorrect because smooth pods would not
always have the SS genotype; smooth pods could also have the Ss genotype.
5. (B) The chances of this cross producing a plant with round peas is . The chances of this cross producing a
plant with constricted pods is . So the chances of producing a plant with both round peas and constricted pods
is the product of their individual probabilities: 
. Given a total number of 800 offspring, 
. Choice (A) is incorrect because it is the expected number of offspring with round peas and
smooth pods. Choice (C) is incorrect because it is the expected number of offspring with wrinkled peas and
constricted pods. Choice (D) is incorrect because 
 of the offspring are expected to be round and  are
expected to be constricted, s
