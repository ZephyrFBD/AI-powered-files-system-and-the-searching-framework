y the same discussion as we used around Fig. 11–42.)
Newton favored a particle theory of light which predicted the opposite result,
that the speed of light would be greater in the second medium 
Thus the
wave theory predicts that the speed of light in water, for example, is less than in air;
and Newton’s particle theory predicts the reverse. An experiment to actually meas-
ure the speed of light in water was performed in 1850 by the French physicist Jean
Foucault, and it confirmed the wave-theory prediction. By then, however, the wave
theory was already fully accepted, as we shall see in the next Section.
Snell’s law of refraction follows directly from Huygens’ principle, given that
the speed of light in any medium is related to the speed in a vacuum, c, and the
index of refraction, n, by Eq. 23–4: that is,
From the Huygens’ con-
struction of Fig. 24–3, angle ADC is equal to 
and angle BAD is equal to 
Then
for the two triangles that have the common side AD, we have
We divide these two
