LEARNING OBJECTIVE

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
EVO-1.C.1
Natural selection is a major mechanism 
of evolution.
EVO-1.C.2
According to Darwin’s theory of natural 
selection, competition for limited resources 
results in differential survival. Individuals with 
more favorable phenotypes are more likely 
to survive and produce more offspring, thus 
passing traits to subsequent generations.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING

Evolution is characterized by a change in the genetic makeup of a population over 
time and is supported by multiple lines of evidence.
