Wireless Transmission of Power—Inductive Charging
Many devices with rechargeable batteries, like cell phones, cordless phones, and even
electric cars, can be recharged using a direct metal contact between the device
and the charger. But devices can also be charged “wirelessly” by induction, with-
out the need for exposed electric contacts. The electric toothbrush shown in
Fig. 21–26 sits on a plastic base. Inside the base is a “primary coil” connected to an
ac outlet. Inside the toothbrush is a “secondary coil” in which a current is induced
due to the changing magnetic field produced by the changing current in the primary
coil. The current induced in the secondary coil charges the rechargeable batteries.
(Not an option for ordinary AA or AAA batteries which are not rechargeable.) The
effect is like a transformer—except here there is no iron to contain the field lines, so
there is less efficiency. But you can separate the two parts (toothbrush and charger)
and brush your teeth. Many
