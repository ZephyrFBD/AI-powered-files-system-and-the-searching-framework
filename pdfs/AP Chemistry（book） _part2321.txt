3NO4 = 0.0750 M and 3O24 = 0.0100 M ? (e) What is the 
rate of disappearance of O2 at the concentrations given in 
part (d)?
 [14.37] Consider the gas-phase reaction between nitric oxide and 
bromine at 273 °C: 2 NO1g2 + Br21g2 ¡ 2 NOBr1g2. 
The following data for the initial rate of appearance of 
NOBr were obtained:

 (a) Determine the rate law. (b) Calculate the average value 
of the rate constant for the appearance of NOBr from the 
four data sets. (c) How is the rate of appearance of NOBr 
related to the rate of disappearance of Br2? (d) What is the 
rate of disappearance of Br2 when 3NO4 = 0.075 M and 
3Br24 = 0.25 M ?
