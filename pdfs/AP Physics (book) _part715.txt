right (increasing x), whereas for
the object is moving to the left (toward
decreasing values of x).
From conservation of momentum, we have
Because the collision is assumed to be elastic, kinetic energy is also conserved:
We have two equations, so we can solve for two unknowns. If we know the masses
and velocities before the collision, then we can solve these two equations for the
velocities after the collision,
and 
We derive a helpful result by rewriting the
momentum equation as
(i)
and we rewrite the kinetic energy equation as
Noting that algebraically  
we write this last equation as
(ii)
We divide Eq. (ii) by Eq. (i), and (assuming
