favorable or neutral allele A is now being
selected against in favor of allele B.
d.
Yes, because it is showing that the frequency of
both alleles are changing over time.
30. A scientist is studying two large populations of deer
that are centralized in nearby forests. She takes blood
samples from all of the deer in each population and
records in how many individuals she finds allele A. She
then computes the frequency of the alleles in each
population. The frequencies observed over five years are
shown in the tables below.

Which forms of evolution are most likely occurring in
populations A and B? Explain your answer.
a.
In population A, genetic drift is likely occurring,
causing allele A to become more prevalent than
allele B. In population B, mutation apparently
occurred, introducing allele A to population B.
Allele A also appears to be increasing due to
