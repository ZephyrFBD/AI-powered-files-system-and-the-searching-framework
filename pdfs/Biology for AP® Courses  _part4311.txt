n content prevent oxidation, thus slowing
down decomposition.
d.
Bogs have low oxygen content and organic
acids, which lowers the pH. Low pH and low
oxygen content prevents reduction, thus slowing
down decomposition.
63. You are asked to estimate the nutrient content of a lake
and its possible effect on net primary productivity. What
data will you collect to determine the effect?
a.
Sample water from different parts of the lake
and determine nutrient composition
b.
Sample the carbon content of the phytoplankton
growing
c.
Take sample of lake water and artificially enrich
it, then see the effect of the enrichment on
phytoplankton growth compared with growth in
unenriched lake water
d.
Wait for spring turnover to check for nutrients
found in the ocean floor
64. The population of a certain species of deer has been
reduced drastically because of indiscriminate hunting.
How will you determine its impact on the local
ecosystem?
