 organism. Natural selection acts on existing variations in the
population; it does not create anything from scratch. Although natural selection selects the fittest individuals, other forces of
evolution, including genetic drift and gene flow, often introduce deleterious alleles to the population’s gene pool. Evolution
has no purpose; it is simply the sum of various forces that influence the genetic and phenotypic variation of a population.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
