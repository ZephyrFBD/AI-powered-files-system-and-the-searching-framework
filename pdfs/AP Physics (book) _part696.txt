ies and masses are, experiments
show that the total momentum before the collision is the same as afterward,
whether the collision is head-on or not, as long as no net external force acts:
(7;3)
That is, the total vector momentum of the system of two colliding balls is conserved:
it stays constant. (We saw this result in this Chapter’s opening photograph.)
Although the law of conservation of momentum was discovered experimen-
tally, it can be derived from Newton’s laws of motion, which we now show.
Let us consider two objects of mass 
and 
that have momenta
and
before they collide and 
and 
after they
collide, as in Fig. 7–4. During the collision, suppose that the force exerted by
object A on object B at any instant is 
Then, by Newton’s third law, the force
exerted by object B on object A is 
During the brief collision time, we assume
no other (external) forces are acting (or that 
is much greater than any other
external forces acting). Over a very short time interval 
we have
