tion of nickel nitrate in 
an iron container because the solution would dissolve the container. When a metal is ox-
idized, it forms various compounds. Extensive oxidation can lead to the failure of metal 
machinery parts or the deterioration of metal structures.
Different metals vary in the ease with which they are oxidized. Zn is oxidized by 
aqueous solutions of Cu2+, for example, but Ag is not. Zn, therefore, loses electrons more 
readily than Ag; that is, Zn is easier to oxidize than Ag.
A list of metals arranged in order of decreasing ease of oxidation, such as in Table 4.5, 
is called an activity series. The metals at the top of the table, such as the alkali metals 
and the alkaline earth metals, are most easily oxidized; that is, they react most readily 
to form compounds. They are called the active metals. The metals at the bottom of the 
activity series, such as the transition elements from groups 8B and 1B, are very stable and 
form compounds less readily. These metals, whic
