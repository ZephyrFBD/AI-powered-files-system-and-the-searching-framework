ng theory to explain the origin of
membrane-bound organelles is the endosymbiosis hypothesis. The endosymbiosis hypothesis states that membrane-
bound organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, were once free-living prokaryotes that were absorbed into
other larger prokaryotes. These prokaryotes became interdependent on each other. The smaller prokaryotes that were
engulfed by the larger prokaryotes evolved to become membrane-bound organelles. As with any theory, it is
important to understand the evidence for the endosymbiosis hypothesis:
Mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA. Mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA is circular, similar to
that of prokaryotic DNA.
Mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own ribosomes, which are similar in structure to prokaryotic
ribosomes.
Mitochondria and chloroplasts reproduce by binary fission, similar to how bacteria reproduce.
There are examples of similar relationships in modern organisms. The paramecium Paramecium bursaria is a euk
