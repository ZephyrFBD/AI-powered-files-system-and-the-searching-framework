irly rare. Since the
mother has the disease and since the gene is dominant, her genotype
is Hh. H is the gene for HD. The husband’s genotype is pure
recessive, hh, since he does not have the condition. The HD gene is
autosomal, not sex-linked. Here is the cross of the parents:
(IST-1 & SP 5)
(C) If genes are on the same chromosome but far apart, they will
often be inherited separately because they will often be separated by
crossover. (IST-1)
(D) Here is the first cross.

All the female offspring are carriers (X–X), and all the male
offspring have white eyes (X–Y).
Here is the second cross.
There is a 50 percent chance that a male will be white-eyed and
a 50 percent chance he will be red-eyed. There is a 50 percent
chance a female will be white-eyed and a 50 percent chance she will
be red-eyed (a carrier). (IST-1)
(B) Here is the cross.
X– shows the presence of the sex-linked trait. The father has the
condition, and he passes it t
