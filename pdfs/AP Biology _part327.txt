like mRNA, which is broken down immediately after it is used, tRNA
is used repeatedly. The energy for this process is provided by GTP
(guanosine triphosphate), a molecule closely related to ATP. Each amino
acid is joined to the correct tRNA by a specific enzyme called aminoacyl-
tRNA synthetase. There are only 20 different aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases, one for each amino acid. There are 64 codons; 61 of them
code for amino acids. One codon, AUG, has two functions; it codes for the
amino acid methionine and is also a start codon. Three codons, UAA,
UGA, and UAG, are stop codons and terminate translation. Some tRNA
molecules have anticodons that can recognize two or more different
codons. This occurs because the pairing rules for the third base of a codon
are not as strict as they are for the first two bases. This relaxation of base
pairing rules is known as wobble. For example, the codons UCU, UCC,
UCA, and UCG all code for the amino acid serine.
