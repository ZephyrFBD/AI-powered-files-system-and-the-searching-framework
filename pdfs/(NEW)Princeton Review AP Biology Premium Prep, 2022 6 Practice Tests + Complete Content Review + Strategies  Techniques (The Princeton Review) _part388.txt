 a perfect fifty-fifty, half dark and half
light. However, at the height of the Industrial Revolution, City 2, our northern city, was heavily polluted, whereas
City 1, our southern city, was unchanged. In the north, where all the trees and buildings were covered with soot, the
light moths didn’t stand a chance. They were impossible for a predator to miss! As a result, the predators gobbled up
light-colored moths just as fast as they could reproduce, sometimes even before they reached an age in which they

predators couldn’t even see them; the dark moths continued doing their thing—above all, reproducing. And when
they reproduced, they had more and more offspring carrying the dark allele.
After a few generations, the peppered moth gene pool in City 2 changed. Although our original moth gene pool was
50 percent light and 50 percent dark, excessive predation changed the population
