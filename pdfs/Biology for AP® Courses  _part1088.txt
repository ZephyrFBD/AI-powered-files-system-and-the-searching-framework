racellular domain is changed with the
domain from another receptor.
c.
The receptor will be mutated and become non-
functional, not activating any pathway.
d.
The receptor will become mutated and lead to
continuous cell signaling, even in the absence of
a ligand.
25. Explain how a chemical that blocks the binding of
EGF to the EGFR would interfere with the replication of
cancerous cells that overexpress EGFR.
a.
It will activate the EGFR pathway.
b.
It will block the EGFR pathway.
c.
It will have no effect and the EGFR pathway
will continue normally
d.
It will lead to overexpression of the EGFR
pathway
26. How does the extracellular matrix control the growth
of cells?
a.
Contact of receptors with the extracellular
matrix maintains equilibrium of the cell and
provides optimal pH for the growth of the cells.
b.
Contact of the receptor with the extracellular
matrix helps maintain concentration gradients
across membrane, resulting in the flow of ions.
c.
The extracellular matrix provides n
