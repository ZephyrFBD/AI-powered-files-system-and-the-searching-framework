What is the lim-
iting reactant? (c) If the actual yield of the reaction was 75% 
instead of 100%, how many molecules of each kind would be 
present after the reaction was over?
sulfuric acid to form hydrogen gas and an aqueous solution of 
zinc sulfate. (d) When liquid phosphorus trichloride is added to 
water, it  
reacts to form aqueous phosphorous acid, H3PO31aq2, 
and aqueous hydrochloric acid. (e) When hydrogen sulfide gas 
is passed over solid hot iron(III) hydroxide, the resulting reac-
tion produces solid iron(III) sulfide and gaseous water.
 3.16 Write balanced chemical equations to correspond to each 
of the following descriptions: (a) When sulfur trioxide gas 
reacts with water, a solution of sulfuric acid forms. (b) Bo-
ron sulfide, B2S31s2, reacts violently with water to form 
dissolved boric acid, H3BO3, and hydrogen sulfide gas. 
 
(c) Phosphine, PH31g2, combusts in oxygen gas to form water 
vapor and solid tetraphosphorus decaoxide. (d) When solid 
mercury(II) nitrate
