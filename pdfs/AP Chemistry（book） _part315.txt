remembering ionic charges, especially those of ele-
ments on the left and right sides of the table. As Figure 2.19 shows, the charges of these ions 
relate in a simple way to their positions in the table: The group 1A elements (alkali metals) form 
1+  
ions, the group 2A elements (alkaline earths) form 2+ ions, the group 7A elements (halo-
gens) form 1- ions, and the group 6A elements form 2- ions. As noted in Practice Exercise 1 
of Sample Exercise 2.8, many of the other groups do not lend themselves to such simple rules.

divides metals from nonmetals also separates cations from anions. Hydrogen forms both 1+ and 
1- ions.
