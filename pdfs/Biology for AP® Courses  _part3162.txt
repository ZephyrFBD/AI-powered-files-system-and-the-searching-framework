K+ enter the cell and polarizes the
membrane.
27. Chemical and electrical synapse are two mechanisms
by which signals can be transferred between neurons.
Which of the following occurs during chemical synapse?
a.
Repolarization at the presynaptic membrane
b.
Calcium influx causes synaptic vesicles to fuse
to the membrane
c.
Neurotransmitters diffuse out of gap junctions
d.
Neurotransmitters bind to synaptic vesicles
28. Chemical synapse is a multiple-step process in which
neurotransmitters undergo transfer and binding to different
parts of the cell. What happens when a neurotransmitter
binds to ligand-gated ion channels?

synapse.
d.
The neurotransmitter is enzymatically degraded.
