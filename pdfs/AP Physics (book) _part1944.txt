93. An electron is accelerated horizontally from rest by a poten-
tial difference of 2200 V. It then passes between two
horizontal plates 6.5 cm long and 1.3 cm apart that have a
potential difference of 250 V (Fig. 17–50). At what angle 
will the electron be traveling after it passes between the
plates?
