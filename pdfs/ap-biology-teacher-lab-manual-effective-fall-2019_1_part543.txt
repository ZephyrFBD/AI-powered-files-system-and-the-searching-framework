 Griffith know that his work would

The concept of cell transformation raises the following questions, among others: 
•  To transform an organism to express new genetic information, do you need to insert 
the new gene into every cell in a multicellular organism or just one? Which organism 
is best suited for total genetic transformation — one composed of many cells or one 
composed of a single cell? 
•  Can a genetically transformed organism pass its new traits on to its offspring? To 
get this information, which would be a better candidate for your investigation — an 
organism in which each new generation develops and reproduces quickly or one that 
does this more slowly? 
•  Based on how you answered the first two sets of questions, what organism would be a 
good choice for investigating genetic transformation — a bacterium, earthworm, fish, 
or mouse? 
If your answer to the last quest
