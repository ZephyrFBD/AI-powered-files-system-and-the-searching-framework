es, sweet potatoes, or
yams). One method you can use to determine the concentration of each unknown solution follows:
1. Cut, dry, and weigh five samples of living material.
 
2. Immerse each sample into a beaker containing one of the unknown solutions.
3. After 45 minutes, remove each sample, dry, and weigh.
4. Calculate the percentage change in weight of each sample.
5. Plot your results (percent weight change vs. unknown solutions). Since a greater solute concentration in the
solution will generate a greater change in potato weight, plotting the solutions on the x-axis in order of their
increasing effect on the potato weight change will display the solutions in order of concentration.
From earlier parts of this investigation, you know that osmosis will occur if the water potentials on each side of the
plasma membrane are unequal; the greater the difference in water potentials, the greater the net movement of water
across the membrane. A cell, then, will gain (in a hypotonic solution
