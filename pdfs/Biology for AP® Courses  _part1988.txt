These disappear in the adults of terrestrial groups but are maintained in adult forms of aquatic groups such as fish and some
amphibians. Great ape embryos, including humans, have a tail structure during their development that is lost by the time of
birth.
Biogeography
The geographic distribution of organisms on the planet follows patterns that are best explained by evolution in conjunction
with the movement of tectonic plates over geological time. Broad groups that evolved before the breakup of the

supercontinent Pangaea (about 200 million years ago) are distributed worldwide. Groups that evolved since the breakup
appear uniquely in regions of the planet, such as the unique flora and fauna of northern continents that formed from the
supercontinent Laurasia and of the southern continents that formed from the supercontinent Gondwana. The presence of
