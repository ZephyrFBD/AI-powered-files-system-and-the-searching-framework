nsidered the father of genetics.
Johann Gregor Mendel (1822â€“1884) (Figure 12.2) was a lifelong learner, teacher, scientist, and man of faith. As a young
adult, he joined the Augustinian Abbey of St. Thomas in Brno in what is now the Czech Republic. Supported by the
monastery, he taught physics, botany, and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels. In 1856, he began
a decade-long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in honeybees and plants, ultimately settling on pea plants as
his primary model system (a system with convenient characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be
applied to other systems). In 1865, Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the
local Natural History Society. He demonstrated that traits are transmitted faithfully from parents to offspring independently
of other traits and in dominant and recessive patterns. In 1866, he published his work, Experiments in Plant Hybridizat
