ncy of the Aa genotype would increase over time and the frequencies of the AA and aa genotypes would
both decrease.
7. (D) The five conditions that are necessary for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are large population size, random
mating, no selection of any kind, no gene flow, and no mutations. Choice (A) is incorrect because large
populations, not small populations, are necessary for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Migration (or gene flow)
also violates one of the conditions necessary for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice
(C) is incorrect because in order for a population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, no selection can occur.
8. (A) If 21% of the population has the recessive phenotype, q2 = 0.21 and q = 0.458. Since p + q = 1, p = 1 â€“
0.458 = 0.542. The frequency of homozygous dominant individuals is p2 = (0.542)2 = 0.29, or 29%. Choice (B)
is the frequency of the recessive allele and is incorrect. Choice (C) is incorrect because 54% is the frequency of
the
