t
of new genetic information into a gene pool. Choice (D) is therefore incorrect.
19. B
The independent variable is the condition the scientist sets up. The dependent variable is the thing that is the
measured outcome of the experiment. The scientist should set different temperatures and then measure the
germination rate. The outdoor temperature is interesting, but it is too variable to be a good control for the
groups with a set temperature.
20. D
Sympatric speciation occurs when there is no geographic barrier separating the two species (as is the case
here). Allopatric speciation requires a geographic barrier.
21. B
Every cell in an organism has the same set of genes, so eliminate (A). Differences in the timing and expression
levels of these genes lead to structural and functional differences, making (B) the correct answer.
22. C
Deoxygenated blood flows through all chambers before going to the lungs. This means the correct answer is
chambers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
23. C
The action potentia
