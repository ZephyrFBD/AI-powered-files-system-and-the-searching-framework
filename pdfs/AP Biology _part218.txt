The enzyme that catalyzes the third step in glycolysis, PFK, is an
allosteric enzyme. When functioning, it catalyzes the reaction of
fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-biphosphate. PFK is inhibited
by the presence of high levels of ATP in the cytoplasm of the cell.
Which of the following graphs most accurately represents the
relationship between PFK activity and ATP?
