onment that is perceived. For example, when a male
European robin sees another male robin, the sight of a tuft of red feathers on the male is a releaser that triggers
fighting behavior. In fact, because instinct underlies all other behavior, it can be thought of as the circuitry that
guides behavior.
For example, hive insects, such as bees and termites, never learn their roles; they are born knowing them. On the
basis of this inborn knowledge, or instinct, they carry out all their other behaviors: a worker carries out “worker
tasks,” a drone “drone tasks,” and a queen “queen tasks.” Another example of instinct is the “dance” of the honey

Innate Selection
Natural selection favors certain behaviors that increase the survival of
offspring. Some of these behaviors are instincts. Many learned behaviors are
also essential for survival indicating that the capability to learn might in fact be
a trait that i
