Harmful algae blooms fueled by excess nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus)
from agricultural fields, sewage treatment plants, industrial facilities, and
the atmosphere disrupt marine ecology. Examples of organisms aﬀected
include underwater grasses, oysters, and fish. The graphs show the
seasonal trends of algal blooms (as measured by chlorophyll a), dissolved
oxygen, dissolved nitrogen, dissolved phosphorus, and water temperature
in the Chesapeake Bay.
When algal blooms die, they sink to the bottom of the bay and are
decomposed by bacteria. Describe what most likely causes the level of
dissolved oxygen to dip in the summer months.

In spring, rain and melting snow cause large volumes of water to flow
