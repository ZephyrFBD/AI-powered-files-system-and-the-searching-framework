38. What are the similarities and differences between the
structures of centrioles and flagella?
a.
Centrioles and flagella are made of microtubules
but show different arrangements.
b.
Centrioles are made of microtubules but flagella
are made of microfilaments and both show the
same arrangement.
c.
Centrioles and flagella are made of
microfilaments. Centrioles have a 9 + 2
arrangement.
d.
Centrioles are made of microtubules and flagella
are made of microfilaments and both have
different structures.
39. Inhibitors of microtubule assembly, vinblastine for
example, are used for cancer chemotherapy. How does an
inhibitor of microtubule assembly affect cancerous cells?
a.
The inhibitors restrict the separation of
chromosomes, thereby stopping cell
