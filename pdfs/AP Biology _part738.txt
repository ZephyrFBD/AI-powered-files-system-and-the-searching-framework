 2,000 antibodies per second
over the cell’s 4–5 day life span. A B cell becomes activated in several
steps. First, an APC (macrophage or dendritic cell) presents an antigen or
epitope on its cell surface using a class II MHC molecule. Next, a helper
T cell that recognizes this epitope-MHC molecule complex is activated
with the aid of cytokines secreted from the APC. See the right side of
Figure 17.1. Once activated, the B cell undergoes multiple cell divisions,
producing thousands of clones. Some of these clones become effector
cells, also called plasma cells, that secrete antibodies. The remainder of
the clones develop into long-term memory cells that can rapidly respond

to any exposure to the same antigen many years later. These memory cells
are responsible for immunological memory and are the reason that a
person does not, for example, generally get measles a second time.
