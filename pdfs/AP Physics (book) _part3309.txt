n be divided into four categories.
What are they?
8. If conduction electrons are free to roam about in a metal,
why don’t they leave the metal entirely?
9. Explain why the resistivity of metals increases with increas-
ing temperature whereas the resistivity of semiconductors
may decrease with increasing temperature.
10. Compare the resistance of a pn junction diode connected
in forward bias to its resistance when connected in reverse
bias.
11. Explain how a transistor can be used as a switch.

12. Figure 29–43 shows a “bridge-type” full-wave rectifier.
Explain 
how 
the
current is rectified
and how current flows
during each half cycle.
15. In a transistor, the base–emitter junction and the base–
collector junction are essentially diodes. Are these junctions
reverse-biased or forward-biased in the application shown
in Fig. 29–41?
16. A transistor can amplify an electronic signal, meaning it
can increase the power of an input signal. Where does it
get
