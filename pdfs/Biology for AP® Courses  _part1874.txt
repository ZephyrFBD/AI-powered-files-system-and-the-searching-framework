Production of Vaccines, Antibiotics, and Hormones
Traditional vaccination strategies use weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms to mount the initial immune response.

Modern techniques use the genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors to mass produce the desired antigen. The antigen
is then introduced into the body to stimulate the primary immune response and trigger immune memory. Genes cloned from
the influenza virus have been used to combat the constantly changing strains of this virus.
Antibiotics are a biotechnological product. They are naturally produced by microorganisms, such as fungi, to attain an
advantage over bacterial populations. Antibiotics are produced on a large scale by cul
