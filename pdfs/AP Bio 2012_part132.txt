analyze situations or solve problems (quantitatively or 
qualitatively) that involve timing and coordination of 
events necessary for normal development in an organism.
(A)
This option is correct. The second indicates that, after fertilization, the 
concentration of the bicoid protein decreases as the concentration of the caudal 
protein increases. Inhibition of the translation of caudal protein by bicoid 
protein is a logical hypothesis about the interaction of these two proteins 
and supports the concept that both the coordination and timing of these two 
proteins are necessary for the normal development in a Drosophila egg.
(B)
This option is incorrect. There is no indication that the bicoid protein stabilizes 
caudal DNA. The first graph shows the relative concentrations of mRNA for the 
two proteins; the second shows the relative concentration of the proteins.
(C)
This option is incorrect. There are not enough data to support that translation of 
bicoid mRNA produces caudal protei
