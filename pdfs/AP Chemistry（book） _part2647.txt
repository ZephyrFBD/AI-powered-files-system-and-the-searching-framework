 16.37  The average pH of normal arterial blood is 7.40. At normal 
body temperature 137 Â°C2, Kw = 2.4 * 10-14. Calculate 
3H+4, 3OH-4, and pOH for blood at this temperature.
 16.38  Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dissolves in raindrops to 
produce carbonic acid 1H2CO32, causing the pH of clean, 
unpolluted rain to range from about 5.2 to 5.6. What are the 
ranges of 3H+4 and 3OH-4 in the raindrops?
 16.39  Addition of the indicator methyl orange to an unknown 
solution leads to a yellow color. The addition of bromthy-
mol blue to the same solution also leads to a yellow color. 
(a) Is the solution acidic, neutral, or basic? (b) What is the 
range (in whole numbers) of possible pH values for the solu-
tion? (c) Is there another indicator you could use to narrow 
the range of possible pH values for the solution?
 16.40  Addition of phenolphthalein to an unknown colorless 
solution does not cause a color change. Th
