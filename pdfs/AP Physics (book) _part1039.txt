10–2 Conversion Factors Between Different Units of Pressure
In Terms of 
1 atm in Different Units
L 10 m of water
 
1 atm = 1.03 * 104 mm-H2O (4°C)
 
1 mm-H2O (4°C) = 9.80 Nm2
1 atm = 760 torr
 
1 torr = 133 Nm2
1 atm = 760 mm-Hg
 
1 mm-Hg = 133 Nm2
1 atm = 76.0 cm-Hg
 
1 cm-Hg = 1.33 * 103 Nm2
1 atm = 2.12 * 103 lbft2
 
1 lbft2 = 47.9 Nm2
1 atm = 14.7 lbin.2
 
1 lbin.2 = 6.90 * 103 Nm2
1 atm = 1.013 * 106 dynecm2
 
1 dynecm2 = 0.1 Nm2
1 atm = 1.013 bar
 
1 bar = 1.000 * 105 Nm2
= 1.013 * 105 Pa = 101.3 kPa
1 atm = 1.013 * 105 Nm2
 
1 atm = 1.013 * 105 Nm2
1 Pa  1 Nm2
Atmospheric pressure can be measured by a modified kind of mercury
manometer with one end closed, called a mercury barometer (Fig. 10–8). The
glass tube is completely filled with mercury and then inverted into the bowl of
mercury. If the tube is long enough, the level of the mercury will drop, leaving a
vacuum at the top of the tube, since atmospheric pressure can support a column
of mercury only about 7
