FIGURE 16–13 Coulomb’s apparatus:
when an external charged sphere is
placed close to the charged one on the
suspended bar, the bar rotates slightly.
The suspending fiber resists the
twisting motion, and the angle of twist
is proportional to the force applied. With 
this apparatus, Coulomb investigated 
how the electric force varies as a 
function of the magnitude of the charges
and of the distance between them.

charged electroscope can be used to
determine the sign of a charged object.
FIGURE 16–11 Electroscope charged
(a) by induction, (b) by conduction.
As we just saw, Coulomb’s law, Eq. 16–1,
[magnitudes] (16;1)
gives the magnitude of the electric force that either charge exerts on the other.
The direction of the electric force is always along the line joining the two charges.
If the two charges have the same sign, the force on either charge is directed away
from the other (they repel each other). If the two charges have opposite signs,
the force o
