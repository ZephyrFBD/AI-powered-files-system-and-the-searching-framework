ues that use large amounts of ATP, such as heart and skeletal
muscle. This form produces ATP. The second form of the enzyme is found in tissues that have a high number of anabolic
pathways, such as liver tissues. This form produces GTP. GTP is energetically equivalent to ATP; however, its use is more
restricted. In particular, protein synthesis primarily uses GTP.
Step 6. Step six is a dehydration process that converts succinate into fumarate. Two hydrogen atoms are transferred to
FAD, producing FADH2. The energy contained in the electrons of these atoms is insufficient to reduce NAD+ but adequate
to reduce FAD. Unlike NADH, this carrier remains attached to the enzyme and transfers the electrons to the electron
transport chain directly. This process is made possible by the localization of the enzyme catalyzing this step inside the inner
membrane of the mitochondrion.
Step 7. Water is added to fumarate during step seven, and malate is produced. The last step in the citric acid cycle
reg
