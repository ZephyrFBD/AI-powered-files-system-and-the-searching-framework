 5′ phosphate on the new nucleotide to the 3′ hydroxyl on the growing nucleotide strand.
TIP
When you think of DNA polymerase adding new nucleotides in the 5′ to 3′ direction, think of adding new cars to a toy train. New cars can only
be added to the back end of the train, not to the engine, just like new nucleotides can only be added to the 3′ hydroxyl, not the 5′ phosphate.
As discussed previously, DNA molecules have directionality; the two strands of the DNA double helix are
antiparallel (oriented in opposite directions). Because DNA polymerase can only add new nucleotides in the 5′ to 3′
direction, and because the two strands of DNA are antiparallel, DNA must proceed slightly differently on the two
strands, as shown in Figure 15.4.

DNA replication can be an intimidating process to learn, and many textbooks have far more detail than you need to know for the AP Biology
exam. The most important things to know are why DNA replication is considered semiconser
