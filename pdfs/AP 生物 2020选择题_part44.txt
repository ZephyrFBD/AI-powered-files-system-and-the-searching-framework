48. Which of the following best explains how the 
extensive folding of the inner mitochondrial 
membrane benefits a eukaryotic cell?

allows for more enzymatic reactions. 
(B) It increases the area available for proteins 
involved in energy transfer. 
(C) It allows for greater area for the diffusion
