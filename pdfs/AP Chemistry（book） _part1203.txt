nts have much high-
er ﬁrst ionization energies than their neighbors in groups 3A 
and 5A. (ii) The addition of an electron to a group 4A ele-
ment leads to a half-ﬁlled np3 outer electron conﬁguration. 
(iii) The group 4A elements have unusually large atomic ra-
dii. (iv) The group 4A elements are easier to vaporize than are 
the group 3A and 5A elements.
 7.93  In the chemical process called electron transfer, an electron is 
transferred from one atom or molecule to another. (We will 
talk about electron transfer extensively in Chapter 20.) A sim-
ple electron transfer reaction is
A1g2 + A1g2 ¡ A+1g2 + A-1g2
 
[7.100]    
The ﬁrst ionization energy of the oxygen molecule is the en-
ergy required for the following process:
O21g2 ¡ O2
+1g2 + e-
 
    
The energy needed for this process is 1175 kJ>mol, very similar 
to the ﬁrst ionization energy of Xe. Would you expect O2 to re-
act with F2? If so, suggest a product or products of this reaction.
