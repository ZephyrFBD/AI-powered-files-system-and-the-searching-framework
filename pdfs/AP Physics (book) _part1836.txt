nergy,
is equal to the negative of the work,
done by the electric field to move the
charge from a to b; so the potential difference 
is
(17;2b)
Note that electric potential, like electric field, does not depend on our test charge q.
V depends on the other charges that create the field, not on the test charge q;
q acquires potential energy by being in the potential V due to the other charges.
We can see from our definition that the positive plate in Fig. 17–1 is at a higher
potential than the negative plate. Thus a positively charged object moves naturally
from a high potential to a low potential. A negative charge does the reverse.
The unit of electric potential, and of potential difference, is joules/coulomb
and is given a special name, the volt, in honor of Alessandro Volta (1745–1827)
who is best known for inventing the electric battery. The volt is abbreviated V,
so 
Potential difference, since it is measured in volts, is often referred
to as voltage. (Be careful not to confuse V f
