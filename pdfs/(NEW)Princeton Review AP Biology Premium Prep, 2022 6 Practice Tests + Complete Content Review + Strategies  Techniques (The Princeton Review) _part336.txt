, and
translation takes place in the cytoplasm.
Obviously, in prokaryotes, both occur in the cytoplasm because prokaryotes don’t contain a nucleus; this allows
transcription and translation to occur at the same time.
The flow of genetic information, the Central Dogma of Biology, is therefore:
Word Connection
A dogma is a core belief or set of ideas. Since this flow of information from
DNA to RNA to protein is so important for understanding the workings of living
things, it has been dubbed the Central Dogma of Biology.
RNA
Before we discuss transcription of RNA, let’s talk about its structure. Although RNA is also made up of nucleotides,
it differs from DNA in three ways.
1. RNA is single-stranded, not double-stranded.
2. The five-carbon sugar in RNA is ribose instead of deoxyribose.
3. The RNA nitrogenous bases are adenine, guanine, cytosine, and a different base called uracil. Uracil replaces
thymine as adenine’s partner.
Here’s a table to compare DNA and RNA. Keep these differences i
