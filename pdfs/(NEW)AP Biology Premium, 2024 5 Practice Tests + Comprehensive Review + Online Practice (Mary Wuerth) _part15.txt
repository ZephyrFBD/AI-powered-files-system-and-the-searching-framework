Big Idea 4: Systems Interactions—Biological systems interact, and these systems and their interactions

you can test which units you are strongest in and which you may want to study more closely. Table 1.1 lists each of
these eight units and the approximate percentage of questions that will be devoted to each unit on the AP Biology
exam.
