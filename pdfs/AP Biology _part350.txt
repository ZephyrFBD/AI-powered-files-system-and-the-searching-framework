es are degraded within minutes of their synthesis. This
rapid degradation of mRNA may be the reason that bacteria change their
patterns of protein synthesis and are so adaptable to changes in the
environment. In contrast, human mRNA may continually translate protein
for hours or weeks. Molecules of mRNA in developing red blood cells are
stable and may translate hemoglobin molecules repeatedly for an extended
time.

Figure 9.15 Overview of Regulation of Gene Expression Within a Cell
New Role for RNA—Controlling Gene Expression
Recent data show that as much as 90% of non-protein-coding DNA is
transcribed into various kinds of noncoding RNA (ncRNA). These
ncRNAs bind to and are assisted by specialized binding proteins called
Argonaute proteins.
While scientists are still learning about these noncoding regions, we
now know that they are not simply “junk,” but they regulate much of our
DNA. Three types of ncRNA have been extensively studied in rec
