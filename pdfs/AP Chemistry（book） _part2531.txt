iddle and right samples in the figure 
were mixed. Would the resulting solution be acidic, neutral, or basic?
Acidic solution
[H+] > [OH−]
[H+][OH−] = 1.0 × 10−14
Neutral solution
[H+] = [OH−]
[H+][OH−] = 1.0 × 10−14
Basic solution
[H+] < [OH−]
[H+][OH−] = 1.0 × 10−14

▲ Figure 16.5 Relative concentrations of H+ and OH− in aqueous solutions at 25 °C.
Calculate the values of 3H+4 and 3OH -4 in a neutral aqueous solution at 25 °C.
Sample Exercise 16.4 
Calculating 3H+ 4 for Pure Water
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to determine the concentrations of H+ and 
OH -  ions in a neutral solution at 25 °C.
Plan We will use Equation 16.16 and the fact that, by definition, 
3H+4 = 3OH -4 in a neutral solution.
Solve We will represent the concentration of H+ and OH-  in neu-
tral solution with x. This gives
 
3H+43OH -4 = 1x21x2 = 1.0 * 10-14
 
x2 = 1.0 * 10-14
 
x = 1.0 * 10-7M = 3H+4 = 3OH -4
