, the attractive strong nuclear force is stronger than the 
positive–positive repulsive electric force and holds the nucleus

The weak nuclear force is weaker than the electric force and the 
strong nuclear force but stronger than the gravitational force. We are 
aware of its existence only because it shows itself in certain types of 
radioactivity.
