ses the wide range of 
materials used in a hybrid automobile, including semiconduc-
tors, ionic solids, alloys, polymers, and more. A new Chemistry 
Put To Work entitled Microporous and Mesoporous Materials exam-
ines materials with different pore sizes and their application in 
ion exchange and catalytic converters.
In Chapter 15 a new A Closer Look box on Temperature 
Changes and Le Châtelier’s Principle explains the theoretical 
underpinnings of the empirical rules that successfully predict 
how temperature changes influence the equilibrium constants 
of exothermic and endothermic reactions.
In Chapter 16 a new A Closer Look box on Polyprotic Acids 
explicitly shows the speciation of ions as a function of pH.
In Chapter 17 a new A Closer Look box entitled Lead Con-
tamination in Drinking Water explores the chemistry behind the 
water quality crisis in Flint, Michigan.
Chapter 18 has been revised to reflect the most up-to-date 
data on atmospheric CO2 levels and the ozone hole. Figur
