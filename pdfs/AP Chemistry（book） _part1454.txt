Molecular Orbitals from 2p Atomic Orbitals
Before we can consider the remaining period 2 diatomic molecules, we must look at the 
MOs that result from combining 2p atomic orbitals. The interactions between p orbitals 
are shown in Figure 9.36, where we have arbitrarily chosen the internuclear axis to be 
the z-axis. The 2pz orbitals face each other head to head. Just as with s orbitals, we can 
combine 2pz orbitals in two ways. One combination concentrates electron density be-
tween the nuclei and is, therefore, a bonding molecular orbital. The other combination 
excludes elec
