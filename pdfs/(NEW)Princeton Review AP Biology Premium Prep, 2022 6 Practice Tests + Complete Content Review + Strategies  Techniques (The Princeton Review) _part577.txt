ifferent structurally, but
you can’t tell this from the graph.

C
The passage says that high CO2 and low pH lead to reduced affinity. A right shift curve would represent a
reduced affinity. Photosynthesis consumes CO2, so this would not increase the CO2. Mitosis and
respiration are not related. Fermentation is done in cells that are doing anaerobic cell respiration, so CO2
should be released, possibly along with lactic acid, which would lower pH.

A
Hemoglobin’s affinity for O2 decreases as the concentration of H+ increases (or the pH decreases) and as
the concentration of OH– increases (or the pH increases). As the pH decreases, the affinity for oxygen will
decrease, and as the pH increases, the affinity for oxygen will increase.

D
The CO2-rich environment would decrease the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, so the curve should
shift toward the right. The regular curve seems to hit 90% saturation around 45–50 pO2, so the CO2-rich
curve would take more oxygen to get there.
