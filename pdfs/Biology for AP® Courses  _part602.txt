Phagocytosis
Phagocytosis (the condition of “cell eating”) is the process by which large particles, such as cells or relatively large particles,
are taken in by a cell. For example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a
neutrophil will remove the invaders through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then
destroyed by the neutrophil (Figure 5.20).

In preparation for phagocytosis, a portion of the inward-facing surface of the plasma membrane becomes coated with a
protein called clathrin, which stabilizes this section of the membrane. The coated portion of the membrane then extends
from the body of the cell and surrounds the particle, event
