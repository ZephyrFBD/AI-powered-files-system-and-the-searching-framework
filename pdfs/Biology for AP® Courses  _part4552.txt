above 30째C, as this is the upper
limit for parous females, leading to a drop in
offspring production. Below 60% humidity not
much change would be seen in the population of
mosquitoes.
b.
The mosquito populations would decrease,
possibly reaching zero. As temperatures above
30째C are the upper limit for parous females,
offspring production would drop. Drier
conditions would do the same.
c.
The mosquito populations would stay the same.
This would be because temperature above 30째C
and humidity below 60% is close to the
favorable conditions of offspring production by
parous females.
d.
The mosquito populations would stay the same
at temperatures above 30째C as higher
temperatures will not affect the production of
viable offspring by parous females. Drier
conditions, below 60% humidity, would cause a
drop in the population, as it is the lower limit for
offspring production.
