12.51  The molecular-orbital diagrams for two- and four-atom 
linear chains of lithium atoms are shown in Figure 12.22. 
Construct a molecular-orbital diagram for a chain contain-
ing six lithium atoms and use it to answer the following 
questions: (a) How many molecular orbitals are there in 
the diagram? (b) How many nodes are in the lowest-energy 
molecular orbital? (c) How many nodes are in the highest-
energy molecular orbital? (d) How many nodes are in the 
highest-energy occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)? (e) 
How many nodes are in the lowest-energy unoccupied mo-
lecular orbital (LUMO)? (f) How does the HOMOâ€“LUMO 
energy gap for this case compare to that of the four-atom 
case?
12.52  Repeat Exercise 12.51 for a linear chain of eight lithium 
atoms.
12.53  Which would you expect to be the more ductile element, 
(a) Ag or Mo, (b) Zn or Si? In each case explain your reasoning.
