 The Abbot’s 
 
 before the walk home to Laman Griffin’s.On rainy days he says, Can I stay 
 
 here tonight? and soon he doesn’t want to go back to Laman Griffin’s at 
 
 all. He’s worn out and hungry with two miles out and two miles back. 
 
 When Mam comes looking for him I don’t know what to say to 
 
 her. I don’t know how to look at her and I keep my eyes off to one side. 
 
 She says,How’s the job? as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin’s 
 
 and I say, Grand, as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin’s. If the 
 
 rain is too heavy for her to go home she stays in the small room upstairs 
 
 with Alphie. She goes back to Laman’s the next day but Michael stays 
 
 and soon she’s moving in herself bit by bit till she stops going to Laman’s 
 
 altogether. 
 
 The Abbot pays the rent every week. Mam gets the relief and the 
 
 food dockets till someone informs on her and she’s cut off from the 
 
  
  
 Dispensary. She’s told that if her son is bringing in a pound a week
