te. After 7 days, the skin of the site of deposition was swabbed and plated on a dish to
assess bacterial growth. The types of bacteria present were then cataloged.

(a) Bacterial communities containing different species of bacteria are no different than other communities with
multiple species. Explain what factors contribute to a carrying capacity.
(b) Identify the two important controls that are used in this experiment. In addition, the experiment includes a
7-day waiting period between when the bacterial transplant takes place. Justify why this is necessary.
(c) Interpret the effect of the transplants between interdigital web space and the buttock, external auditory
canal, and plantar heel areas.
(d) If each deposition site is pretreated with known antibiotics, explain how this would likely affect the results.
