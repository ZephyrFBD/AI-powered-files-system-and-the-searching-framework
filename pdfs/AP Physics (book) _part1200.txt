Intensity Related to Amplitude and Frequency
For a sinusoidal wave of frequency f, the particles move in SHM as a wave 
passes, so each particle has an energy
where A is the amplitude of 
its motion. Using Eq. 11–6b, we can write k in terms of the frequency:
where m is the mass of a particle (or small volume) of the
medium. Then
The mass
where is the density of the medium and V is the volume of
a small slice of the medium as shown in Fig. 11–32. The volume 
where 
S is the cross-sectional surface area through which the wave travels. (We use S
instead of A for area because we are using A for amplitude.) We can write as the
distance the wave travels in a time t as
where v is the speed of the wave.
Thus

From this equation, we see again the important result that the energy transported
by a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude. The average power trans-
ported,
is

Finally, the intensity I of a wave is the average power transpor
