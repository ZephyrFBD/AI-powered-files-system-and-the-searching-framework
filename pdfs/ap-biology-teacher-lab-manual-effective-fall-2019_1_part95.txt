veral ancestors, such as parents or grandparents; or 
(4) making the forensic identification of an individual using genetic markers. Even so-
called “plug-and-chug” problem solving, where students follow an algorithm or apply a 
formula, helps students to develop an intuition about how sensitive or robust a model is. 
Interactive software, which lets students vary parameters over wide ranges with multiple 
variables and visualize results, provides a particularly effective tool to help students 
better draw inferences about the fit of a particular model to a biological problem. 
As you design your instruction, consider making a connection between game 
strategies and problem-solving strategies. An excellent example is the game Mastermind, 
where students develop strategies and methods to deduce the colors and sequence 
of an unknown or hidden sequence of colored pegs (http://www.mah-jongg.ch/ 
mastermind/mastermind.html). The goals of this game are directly applicable to 
sequencing a p
