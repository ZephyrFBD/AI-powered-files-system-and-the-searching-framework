e a light as the Sun at 6000 K? Explain.
2. If energy is radiated by all objects, why can we not see them
in the dark? (See also Section 14â€“8.)
3. What can be said about the relative temperatures of
whitish-yellow, reddish, and bluish stars? Explain.
4. Darkrooms for developing black-and-white film were
sometimes lit by a red bulb. Why red? Explain if such a
bulb would work in a darkroom for developing color film.
5. If the threshold wavelength in the photoelectric effect
increases when the emitting metal is changed to a different
metal, what can you say about the work functions of the
two metals?
6. Explain why the existence of a cutoff frequency in the
photoelectric effect more strongly favors a particle theory
rather than a wave theory of light.
7. UV light causes sunburn, whereas visible light does not.
Suggest a reason.
8. The work functions for sodium and cesium are 2.28 eV and
2.14 eV, respectively. For incident photons of a given fre-
quency, which metal will give a higher maxi
