e proportional to the operating temperatures 
and 
(in kelvins):
So the efficiency can be written as
(15;5)
Equation 15–5 expresses the fundamental upper limit to the efficiency of any heat
engine. A higher efficiency would violate the second law of thermodynamics.†
Real engines always have an efficiency lower than this because of losses due to
friction and the like. Real engines that are well designed reach 60 to 80% of the
Carnot efficiency.

†If an engine had a higher efficiency than Eq. 15–5, it could be used in conjunction with a Carnot
engine that is made to work in reverse as a refrigerator. If W was the same for both, the net result
would be a flow of heat at a low temperature to a high temperature without work being done. That
would violate the Clausius statement of the second law.
