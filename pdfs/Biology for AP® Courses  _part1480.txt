The content presented in this section supports the learning objectives outlined in Big Ideas 3 and 4 of the AP速 Biology
Curriculum Framework. The AP速 learning objectives merge essential knowledge content with one or more of the seven
science practices. These objectives provide a transparent foundation for the AP速 Biology course, along with inquiry-based
laboratory experiences, instructional activities, and AP速 exam questions.
