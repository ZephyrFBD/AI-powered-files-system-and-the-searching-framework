 lying there, to be
seen more readily.
Polarizing angle. (a) At what incident angle is sunlight
reflected from a lake perfectly plane-polarized? (b) What is the refraction angle?
APPROACH The polarizing angle at the surface is Brewster’s angle, Eq. 24–6b.
We find the angle of refraction from Snell’s law.
SOLUTION (a) We use Eq.24–6b with
so 
giving
(b) From Snell’s law,
giving 
NOTE
as expected.
up + ur = 53.1° + 36.9° = 90.0°,
ur = 36.9°.
sin ur = sin upn = sin 53.1°1.33 = 0.601
up = 53.1°.
tan up = 1.33
n = 1.33,
EXAMPLE 24;15
by substituting Eq. 24–6a,
into Snell’s law,
which gives
which can only hold if
(see Trigonometric identities inside back cover or Appendix page A-8).
up = 90° - ur
cos up = sin ur
n1 sin up = n2 sin ur ,
n2 = n1 tan up = n1 sin upcos up,
