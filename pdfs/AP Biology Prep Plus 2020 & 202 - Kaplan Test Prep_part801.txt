Wolves are predators, so if they disappear from an ecosystem, it
should lead to an increase in the populations of animals that they
preyed upon. The cause of the erosion most likely has to do with
eﬀects caused by one of these prey species, as they increased in
number. (B) is correct because it presents a plausible scenario, in
which an increase in elk populations leads to a decrease in vegetation,
which in turn would contribute to riverbank erosion. (A) is incorrect
because it gives an explanation of why the presence of wolves could
cause erosion, but the question stem specifies that it was the
disappearance of wolves that caused this. (C) is incorrect because
predators hunt other animals; they do not generally feed on
vegetation. (D) is incorrect because erosion occurred aȇer the wolves
disappeared; if the dams help combat erosion, then erosion should not
be a problem aȇer a beaver predator is removed and more dams can
be built.
