f scientific study provide evidence for evolution. Here are
six.
1. Fossil Record
The fossil record documents the existence of species that have become
extinct or have evolved into other species. Radiometric dating and half-
life accurately measure the age of fossils. Prokaryotes were the first
organisms to develop on Earth, and they are the oldest fossils.
Paleontologists have discovered many transitional forms that link older
fossils to modern species, such as the transition from Eohippus to the
modern horse, Equus. Archaeopteryx is a fossil that links reptiles and
birds. The fossil record also indicates that all the organisms alive today are
only a tiny fraction of all the organisms that ever lived. In other words,
most life that existed on Earth went extinct.
EVO-1 & EVO-2
Scientific evidence supports the idea that evolution has occurred in all species.
2. Comparative Anatomy
The study of different structures contributes to scientistsâ€™ understanding of
the evolution of anatomical s
