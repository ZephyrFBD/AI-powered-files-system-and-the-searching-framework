ence of rinderpest in the wildebeest population. The
prevalence of the virus is shown with open squares in the figure
below. The wildebeest population is represented by closed
circles.
Based on this data, how will the vaccination program most likely
aﬀect the Serengeti ecosystem?

The wildebeest population will increase due to the reduction
in rinderpest prevalence, which will lead to an increase in
grass cover and tree cover.
(A)
The wildebeest population will decrease due to the reduction
in rinderpest prevalence, which will cause the rinderpest to
develop immunity to the vaccination protocol.
(B)
The wildebeest population will increase due to the reduction
in rinderpest prevalence, which will result in less grass
available to generate and spread fires.
(C)
The wildebeest population will decrease due to the re
