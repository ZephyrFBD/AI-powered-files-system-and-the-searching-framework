generates
genetic variation, is random. Whether mutations
have a positive, negative, or neutral effect in
terms of selective advantage is also random.
Mutations and their effects are random, so the
overall process of evolution is random.
50. The selective breeding of plants and animals that
possess desired traits is a process called artificial selection.
For example, broccoli, cabbage, and kale are all vegetables
that have been selected from one species of wild mustard.
How is artificial selection both similar to and different
from Darwinâ€™s conception of natural selection? Does
artificial selection provide evidence for evolution by
natural selection? Explain.

a.
Both artificial selection and natural selection are
the differential reproduction of individual
organisms with favored traits. In artificial
selection, humans have actively modified plants
and animals by selecting and breeding
individuals with traits deemed desirable. In
natural
