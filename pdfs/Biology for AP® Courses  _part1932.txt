encing to save lives. Genomics has many industrial applications including biofuel development, agriculture,
pharmaceuticals, and pollution control. The basic principle of all modern-day sequencing strategies involves the chain
termination method of sequencing.
Although the human genome sequences provide key insights to medical professionals, researchers use whole-genome
sequences of model organisms to better understand the genome of the species. Automation and the decreased cost of
whole-genome sequencing may lead to personalized medicine in the future.
17.4 Applying Genomics
Imagination is the only barrier to the applicability of genomics. Genomics is being applied to most fields of biology; it is
being used for personalized medicine, prediction of disease risks at an individual level, the study of drug interactions
before the conduct of clinical trials, and the study of microorganisms in the environment as opposed to the laboratory. It is
also being applied to developments such as th
