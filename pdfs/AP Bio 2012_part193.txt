udent is unable to explain 
that the decreasing curve is due to the fact that increasing 
humidity leads to reduced evaporation rates due to a 
decreased difference in water vapor pressure between the 
leaf and the atmosphere but can explain generically that 
water does not evaporate as readily in high humidity.

(Part c) The student can use the graph, a representation of 
the effect of increasing percentage of open stomata per area 
of leaf on the rate of transpiration. The student recognizes 
and is able to articulate an understanding of the difference 
in rates of transpiration from 0–60 percent open stomata 
compared to 60 percent–100 percent open stomata. The 
student articulates the understanding that as the number of 
open stomata increases, the rate of diffusion between the leaf 
interior and the environment will increase, and therefore 
the transpiration rate also increases. The student is unable 
to recognize that above 60 percent open stomata there must 
be anoth
