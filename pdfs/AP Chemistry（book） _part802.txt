of energy (although it is 
still less than 20% of U.S. per capita energy consumption).
Global fuel energy consumption in 2012 was more than 
5 * 1017 kJ, a staggeringly large number. More than 80% of current en-
ergy requirements comes from combustion of nonrenewable fossil fuels, 
especially coal and petroleum. The exploration of new fossil fuel sources 
often involves environmentally sensitive regions, making the search for 
new supplies of fossil fuels a major political and economic issue.
The global importance of petroleum is in large part because it 
provides liquid fuels, such as gasoline, that are critical to supplying 
transportation needs. One of the most promising—but controver-
sial—alternatives to petroleum-based fuels is biofuels, liquid fuels 
derived from biological matter. The most common approach to pro-
ducing biofuels is to transform plant sugars and other carbohydrates 
into combustible liquids.
The most commonly produced biofuel is bioethanol, which is
