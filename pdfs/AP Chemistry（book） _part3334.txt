chlorine in chloramine? (c) Is Cl oxi-
dized, reduced, or neither, upon the conversion of bleach 
to chloramine? (d) Another toxic gas that can be produced 
is nitrogen trichloride, NCl3. What is the oxidation num-
ber of N in nitrogen trichloride? (e) Is N oxidized, reduced, 
or neither, upon the conversion of ammonia to nitrogen 
 
trichloride?
 20.114 A voltaic cell is based on Ag+1aq2>Ag1s2 and Fe3+1aq2>
Fe2+1aq2 half-cells. (a) What is the standard emf of the cell? 
(b) Which reaction occurs at the cathode and which at the 
anode of the cell? (c) Use S° values in Appendix C and the 
relationship between cell potential and free-energy change 
to predict whether the standard cell potential increases or 
decreases when the temperature is raised above 25 °C.
 20.115  Hydrogen gas has the potential for use as a clean fuel in 
reaction with oxygen. The relevant reaction is
2 H21g2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 H2O1l2
Consider two possible ways of utilizing this reaction as 
an electrical energy source: (
