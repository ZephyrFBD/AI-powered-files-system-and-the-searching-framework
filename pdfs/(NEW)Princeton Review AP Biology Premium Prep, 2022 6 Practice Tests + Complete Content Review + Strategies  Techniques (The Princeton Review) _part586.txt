ing a host.
Choice (B) is incorrect, as all viruses have genomes and some have many genes. Choice (C) is also wrong
because prokaryotes are cells and do not have nuclei. You can also eliminate (D), as viruses evolve

C
The origin of life refers to the period when the first life began. Life is shown to be present 3.5 billion
years ago when no atmospheric oxygen was present yet, so (A) can be eliminated. Also, there was no life
at 4 billion years despite having CO2 and no O2; therefore, something else must be required, and (B) can
be eliminated. There were no proteins when the first life arose, so (D) is incorrect. Choice (C) states that
self-replicating nucleic acids were necessary, which is why life could only occur when RNA appeared.

B
Functional ribosomes would not likely be found before the proteins they make. Therefore, this would be
between 3.5 and 3.25 billion years ago.
