An electron in a circular orbit of radius r (Fig. 27–27) would have a centripetal
acceleration 
produced by the electrical force of attraction between the 
negative electron and the positive nucleus. This force is given by Coulomb’s law,
where 
The charge on the electron is
and that on the nucleus is
where Ze is the charge on the
nucleus:
is the charge on a proton, Z is the number of protons in the nucleus
(called “atomic number,” Section 28–7).† For the hydrogen atom,
In Newton’s second law,
we substitute Coulomb’s law for F and
for a particular allowed orbit of radius 
and obtain
We solve this for 
and then substitute for v from Eq. 27–11 (which says
):
We solve for 
(it appears on both sides, so we cancel one of them) and find
(27;12)
where n is an integer (Eq. 27–11), and 
Equation 27–12 gives the
