Orbitals and Their Energies
We can describe the electronic structure of a many-electron atom by 
using the orbitals we described for the hydrogen atom in Table 6.2  
(p. 230). Thus, the orbitals of a many-electron atom are designated 1s, 
2px, and so forth (Table 6.2) and have the same general shapes as the 
corresponding hydrogen orbitals.
Although the shapes of the orbitals of a many-electron atom are 
the same as those for hydrogen, the presence of more than one elec-
tron greatly changes the  
energies of the orbitals. In hydrogen, the 
energy of an orbital depends only on its principal quantum number, n 
(Figure 6.18). For instance, in a hydrogen atom, the 3s, 3p, and 3d sub-
shells all have the same energy. In a many-electron atom, however, the 
energies of the various subshells in a given shell are different because 
of electronâ€“electron repulsions. To explain w
