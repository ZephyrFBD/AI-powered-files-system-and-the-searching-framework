to review graphical determination of slopes in Appendix A. If you are familiar 
with calculus, you may recognize that the average rate approaches the instantaneous rate as 
the time interval approaches zero. This limit, in the notation of calculus, is the negative of the 
derivative of the curve at time t, -d3C4H9Cl4>dt.

CHAPTER 14 Chemical Kinetics
Reaction Rates and Stoichiometry
During our discussion of the hypothetical reaction A ¡ B, we saw that the stoichiom-
etry requires that the rate of disappearance of A equal the rate of appearance of B. Like-
wise, the stoichiometry of Equation 14.3 indicates that 1 mol of C4H9OH is produced for 
each mole of C4H9Cl consumed. Therefore, the rate of appearance of C4H9OH equals the 
rate of disappearance of C4H9Cl:
 
Rate = -

What happens when the stoichiometric relationships are not one-to-one? For exam-
ple, consider the reaction 2 HI1g2 ¡ H21g2 + I21g2. We can measur
