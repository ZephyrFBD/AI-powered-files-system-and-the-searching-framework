structure is formed when multiple subunits come together
to form the functional protein.
8. (B) Secondary structure is driven by the formation of hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl groups and amino
groups in a polypeptide chain. Choice (A) is incorrect because hydrophobic interactions between R-groups
influence tertiary and quaternary structures but not secondary structures. Choice (C) is incorrect because
disulfide bridges are formed in tertiary and quaternary structures, not secondary structures. Choice (D) is
incorrect because multiple subunits/domains are only present in quaternary structures.
9. (C) Both DNA and RNA have a phosphate group attached to the 5â€² carbon. Choice (A) is incorrect because
RNA does not contain thymine. A double-stranded antiparallel helix is only present in DNA, not RNA, so
choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because ribose is present in RNA but not in DNA.
10. (D) Deoxyribose is found in DNA; ribose is found in RNA. Choice (A) is incorrect be
