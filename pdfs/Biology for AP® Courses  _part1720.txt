52. Gamow (1954) proposed that the structure of DNA
deduced by Watson and Crick (1953) could be interpreted
as a way of forming roughly 20 "words" of the common
amino acids from the four "letters" A, T, C, and G that
represent DNA nucleotides.
Crick and coworkers (1961) used a method developed by
Benzer to induce mutations in the DNA of a virus by the
insertion of a single nucleotide. The mutant could not
infect the bacterium Escherichia coli and neither could
viruses with a second insertion of a second DNA
nucleotide. However, a third nucleotide insertion restored
the ability
