f the high-energy, short-wavelength radiation 
from the solar spectrum before that radiation reaches the lower atmosphere. As it does, 
atomic oxygen, O, is formed. The dissociation of O2 is very extensive at higher elevations. 
At 400 km, for example, only 1% of the oxygen is in the form of O2; 99% is atomic oxy-
gen. At 130 km, O2 and atomic oxygen are just about equally abundant. Below 130 km, 
O2 is more abundant than atomic oxygen because most of the solar energy has been 
absorbed in the upper atmosphere.
The dissociation energy of N2 is very high, 941 kJ>mol. As you should have seen in 
working out Practice Exercise 2 of Sample Exercise 18.2, only photons having a wave-
length shorter than 127 nm possess sufficient energy to dissociate N2. Furthermore, N2 
does not readily absorb photons, even when they possess sufficient energy. As a result, 
very little atomic nitrogen is formed in the upper atmosphere by photodissociation of N2.
