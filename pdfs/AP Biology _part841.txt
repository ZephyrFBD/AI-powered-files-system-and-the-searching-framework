 pattern should
be visible. By measuring the distance of each fragment from the well
(similar to determining the Rf value in paper chromatography) and
comparing this distance against a standard, the size of the fragment of
DNA can be determined; see Figure 19.21.

LAB #10: ENERGY DYNAMICS—FOOD CHAIN
Introduction
Almost all life on this planet is powered, either directly or indirectly, by
sunlight. Producers capture solar energy and convert it to biomass. The net
amount of energy captured and stored by the producers in a system is the
system’s net primary productivity. In contrast, the gross primary
productivity is a measure of the total energy captured. Different plants
have different strategies of energy allocation that reflect their role in
different ecosystems. For example, annual weedy plant
