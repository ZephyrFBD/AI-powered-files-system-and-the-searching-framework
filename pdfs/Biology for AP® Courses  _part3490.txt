ssification divides joints into three categories: synarthroses, amphiarthroses, and diarthroses. A
synarthrosis is a joint that is immovable. This includes sutures, gomphoses, and synchondroses. Amphiarthroses are joints
that allow slight movement, including syndesmoses and symphyses. Diarthroses are joints that allow for free movement of
the joint, as in synovial joints.
Movement at Synovial Joints
The wide range of movement allowed by synovial joints produces different types of movements. The movement of synovial
joints can be classified as one of four different types: gliding, angular, rotational, or special movement.
Gliding Movement
Gliding movements occur as relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other. Gliding movements produce very little
rotation or angular movement of the bones. The joints of the carpal and tarsal bones are examples of joints that produce
gliding movements.
Angular Movement
Angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint chang
