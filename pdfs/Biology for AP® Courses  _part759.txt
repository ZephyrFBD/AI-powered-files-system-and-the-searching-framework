 important because the products are
obtained consistently with time.
c.
Enzymes are important because it does not
disturb the concentration of the products.
d.
Enzymes are important because energy remains
conserved and no loss of energy occurs.
44. How does enzyme feedback inhibition benefit a cell?
a.
Feedback inhibition benefits the cell by blocking
the production of the products by changing the
configuration of enzymes. This will prevent the
cells from becoming toxic.
b.
Feedback inhibition benefits the cell by blocking
the production of the reactants by changing the
configuration of enzymes. This will prevent the
cells from becoming toxic.
c.
Feedback inhibition benefits the cell by blocking
the production of the products by changing the
configuration of reactants. This will prevent the
cells from becoming toxic.
d.
Feedback inhibition benefits the cell by blocking
the production of the products by reducing the
reactants. This will prevent the cells from
becoming toxic.
