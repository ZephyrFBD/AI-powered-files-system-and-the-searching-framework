he system is at equilibrium, 
Q = K. If Q ≠K, however, the system is not at equilibrium. When 
Q 6 K, the reaction will move toward equilibrium by forming more 
products (the reaction proceeds from left to right); when Q 7 K, the 
reaction will move toward equilibrium by forming more reactants (the 
reaction proceeds from right to left). Knowing the value of K makes it 
possible to calculate the equilibrium amounts of reactants and prod-
ucts, often by the solution of an equation in which the unknown is 
the change in a partial pressure or concentration.
LE CHÂTELIER’S PRINCIPLE (SECTION 15.7) Le Châtelier’s prin-
ciple states that if a system at equilibrium is disturbed, the equilib-
rium will shift to minimize the disturbing influence. Therefore, if a 
reactant or product is added to a system at equilibrium, the equilib-
rium will shift to consume the added substance. The effects of remov-
ing reactants or products and of changing the pressure or volume of 
a reaction can be similarl
