Let us apply the law of conservation of momentum to a collision like that of
Fig. 7–18. We choose the xy plane to be the plane in which the initial and final
momenta lie. Momentum is a vector, and because the total momentum is 
conserved, its components in the x and y directions also are conserved. The
x component of momentum conservation gives

where primes 
refer to quantities after the collision.There is no motion in the y direc-
tion initially, so the y component of the total momentum is zero before the collision.

7–7 Collisions in Two Dimensions
Conservation of momentum and energy can also be applied to collisions in two or
three dimensions, where the vector nature of momentum is especially important.
One common type of non-head-on collision is that in
