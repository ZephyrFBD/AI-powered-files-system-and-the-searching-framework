et the swing going myself but all I can do is move it back 
 
 and forth and I’m angry because Freddie and Malachy are laughing at 
 
 the way I can’t swing.They’re great pals now, Freddie, seven, Malachy, 
 
 two.They laugh every day and Malachy’s tongue gets better with all the 
 
 laughing. 
 
 When he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his 
 
 teeth are and you can see his eyes shine. He has blue eyes like my 
 
 mother. He has golden hair and pink cheeks. I have brown eyes like 
 
 Dad. I have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror. My 
 
 mother tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall that Malachy is the happiest 
 
 child in the world. She tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall, Frankie has 
 
 the odd manner like his father. I wonder what the odd manner is but I 
 
 can’t ask because I’m not supposed to be listening. 
 
 I wish I could swing up into the sky, up into the clouds. I might be able 
 
  
  
 to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers, Oli
