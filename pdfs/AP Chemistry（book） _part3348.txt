rocess as alpha decay or alpha emission.
What product is formed when radium-226 undergoes alpha emission?
Sample Exercise 21.1 
Predicting the Product of a Nuclear Reaction
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to determine the nucleus that results when 
radium-226 loses an alpha particle.
Plan We can best do this by writing a balanced nuclear reaction for 
the process.
Solve The periodic table shows that radium has an atomic number 
of 88. The complete chemical symbol for radium-226 is therefore 
226
88Ra. An alpha particle is a helium-4 nucleus, and so its symbol is 
4
2He. The alpha particle is a product of the nuclear reaction, and so 
the equation is of the form
226
88Ra ยก A
ZX + 4
2He
where A is the mass number of the product nucleus and Z is its 
atomic number. Mass numbers and atomic numbers must bal-
ance, so
226 = A + 4
and
88 = Z + 2
Hence,
A = 222 and Z = 86
Again, from the periodic table, the element with Z = 86 is radon 
(Rn). The product, therefore, is 222
86Rn, and the nuclear
