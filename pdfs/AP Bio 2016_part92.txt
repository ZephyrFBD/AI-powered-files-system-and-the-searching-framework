for wild-type wings, and  
the allele for white eyes is recessive to the allele 
for red eyes. The gene controlling wing type  
is carried on an autosome, whereas the gene 
controlling eye color is carried on the 
X chromosome. 
A true-breeding female with wild-type wings and 
white eyes is crossed with a male with vestigial 
wings and red eyes. What proportion of the 
offspring are expected to be males with wild-type 
wings and white eyes? Give your answer as  
a fraction or a decimal value from 0 to 1. 
123. ABO blood type in humans is determined by 
three alleles of a single gene: IA, IB, and i. The IA 
and IB alleles are codominant, and both alleles are 
completely dominant to the i allele. 
Shown in the table are the approximate genotype 
frequencies of ABO blood types for a large 
human population.
