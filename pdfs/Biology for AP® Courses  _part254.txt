ns (Fe2+) were more
available in the early ocean than at present since the
concentration of oxygen is high. Nitrogen (N2), while
always abundant in the atmosphere, was not available until
the evolution of molybdenum-based nitrogen-fixing
proteins.

Figure 2.32
The graphs (Anbar and Knoll, Science, 297, 2002) show
models of concentrations of two trace elements, iron (Fe)
and molybdenum (Mo), in ocean waters. The model
describes the change over time of these elements from
early Earth (>1.85 billion years ago, Gya) to a modern era
(<1.25 Gya) and a period of transition between these.
Surface waters of the oceans lie to the left of the vertical
double line. Modern concentrations of dissolved iron and
molybdenum (relative to dissolved carbon) are shown.
A. The principle chemical processes of life today have
been conserved through evolution from early Eart
