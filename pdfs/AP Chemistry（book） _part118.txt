g diodes (LEDs), and building materials. We have also 
discovered that some chemicals are harmful to our health or the environment. This 
means that we must be sure that the materials with which we come into contact are 
safe. As a citizen and consumer, it is in your best interest to understand the effects, both 
positive and negative, that chemicals can have, in order to arrive at a balanced outlook 
regarding their uses.
You may be studying chemistry because it is an essential part of your curricu-
lum. Your major might be chemistry, or it could be biology, engineering, pharmacy, 
agriculture, geology, or some other field. Chemistry is central to a fundamental 
understanding of governing principles in many science-related fields. For example, 
our interactions with the material world raise basic questions about the materials 
around us. Figure 1.2 illustrates how chemistry is central to several different realms 
of modern life.
