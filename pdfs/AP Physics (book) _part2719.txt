24–12 Scattering of Light by the Atmosphere
Sunsets are red, the sky is blue, and skylight is polarized (at least partially).
These phenomena can be explained on the basis of the scattering of light by the
molecules of the atmosphere. In Fig. 24–54 we see unpolarized light from the Sun
impinging on a molecule of the Earth’s atmosphere. The electric field of the EM
wave sets the electric charges within the molecule into oscillation, and the mole-
cule absorbs some of the incident radiation. But the molecule quickly reemits this
light since the charges are oscillating. As discussed in Section 22–2, oscillating
electric charges produce EM waves. The intensity is strongest along the direction
perpendicular to the oscillation, and drops to zero along the line of oscillation
