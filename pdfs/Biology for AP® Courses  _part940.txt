 highly specific pattern of absorption. Chlorophyll a absorbs wavelengths from either end
of the visible spectrum (blue and red), but not green. Because green is reflected or transmitted, chlorophyll appears green.
Carotenoids absorb in the short-wavelength blue region, and reflect the longer yellow, red, and orange wavelengths.

Figure 8.13 (a) Chlorophyll a, (b) chlorophyll b, and (c) β-carotene are hydrophobic organic pigments found in
the thylakoid membrane. Chlorophyll a and b, which are identical except for the part indicated in the red box, are
responsible for the green color of leaves. β-carotene is responsible for the orange color in carrots. Each pigment has
(d) a unique absorbance spectrum.
Many photosynthetic organisms have a mixture of pigments; using them, the organism can absorb energy from a wider
range of wavelengths. Not all photosynthetic organisms have full access to sunlight. Some organisms grow underwater
where light intensity and qua
