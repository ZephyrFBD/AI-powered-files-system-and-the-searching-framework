Plants can be endemic or generalists: endemic plants are found only on specific regions of the Earth, while generalists
are found on many regions. Isolated land masses—such as Australia, Hawaii, and Madagascar—often have large numbers

brighamii), for instance, is endemic to Hawaii; only an estimated 15–20 trees are thought to exist (Figure 35.7).
