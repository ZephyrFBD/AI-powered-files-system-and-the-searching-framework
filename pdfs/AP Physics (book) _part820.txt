. Then we draw another line,
perpendicular to this line of action, that goes to the axis of rotation and is 
perpendicular also to it. The length of this second line is the lever arm for 
and
is labeled
in Fig. 8–12b. The lever arm for 
is the full distance from the hinge
to the doorknob,
(just as in Fig. 8–10). Thus 
is much smaller than .
