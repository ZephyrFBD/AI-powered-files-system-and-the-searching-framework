tive in designing a 
lab program while ensuring students explore and 
develop understandings of core techniques. After 
completion, students should be able to explain how 
to collect data, use data to form conclusions, and 
apply their conclusions to larger biological concepts. 
Students should report recorded data and quantitative 
conclusions drawn from the data with appropriate 
precision (i.e., significant figures). Students should 
also develop an understanding of how changes in the 
design of the experiments would impact the validity 
and accuracy of their results. Many questions on the 
AP exam are written in an experimental context, so 
these skills will prove invaluable for both concept 
comprehension and exam performance.
Lab Materials
AP Biology is a college-level course, but the equipment 
and chemicals needed for the labs are comparable to 
those required for a high school-level biology course.
