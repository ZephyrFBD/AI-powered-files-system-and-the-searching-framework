 variation.
Construct an explanation of the role of duplication as a
source of raw material for future mutations and selection
and contrast this type of variation with recombination.
23. Bacteria and Archaea reproduce asexually, and genetic
material is in a closed loop. In both domains, genetic
material is transferred horizontally, and polyploidy is
common. Polypoidy is common in plants and occurs in
invertebrate animals but is less common in vertebrates. In
all domains, multiple copies of genes (gene duplication)
are common.
Based on this information, compare and contrast the
mechanisms that provide genetic variation in the three
domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.
