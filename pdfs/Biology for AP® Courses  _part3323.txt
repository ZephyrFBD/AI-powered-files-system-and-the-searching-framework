lease of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone
(LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. These hormones regulate the testes in males and ovaries in females. In males,
FSH stimulates the maturation of sperm cells; LH stimulates the production of the sex hormones or androgens such as
testosterone. (Anabolic steroids, a form of testosterone, have been associated with performance boosting in professional
athletes.) In females, FSH stimulates the development of egg cells (ova); LH also plays a role in the development of ova,
induction of ovulation, and stimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. Estradiol and progesterone
are steroid hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle, among other functions. (Birth control pills designed to prevent
ovulation contain fluctuating levels of these hormones.)
