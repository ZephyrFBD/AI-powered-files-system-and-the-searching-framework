Notice it is not simply a single bone, but rather a grouping of several bones arranged in a similar way. The more complex
the feature, the more likely any kind of overlap is due to a common evolutionary past. Imagine two people from different
countries both inventing a car with all the same parts and in exactly the same arrangement without any previous or shared
knowledge. That outcome would be highly improbable. However, if two people both invented a hammer, it would be
reasonable to conclude that both could have the original idea without the help of the other. The same relationship between
complexity and shared evolutionary history is true for homologous structures in orga
