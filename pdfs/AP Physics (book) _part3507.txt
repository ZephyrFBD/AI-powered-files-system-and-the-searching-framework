inhaled or injected, accumulate in the organ or region of the body to be studied.

Nuclear Energy; Effects and Uses of Radiation
When such a nuclide undergoes 
decays, the emitted positron travels at most 
a few millimeters before it collides with a normal electron. In this collision, the
positron and electron are annihilated, producing two 
rays 
each having an energy of 511 keV 
The two 
rays fly off in opposite
directions 
since they must have almost exactly equal and opposite
momenta to conserve momentum (the momenta of the initial 
and 
are essen-
tially zero compared to the momenta afterward of the rays). Because the photons
travel along the same line in opposite directions, their detection in coincidence
by rings of detectors surrounding the patient (Fig. 31â€“21) readily
