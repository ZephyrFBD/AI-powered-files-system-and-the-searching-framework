 of the Sun, peaks in
the visible part of the spectrum. For lower temperatures, the total intensity drops
considerably and the peak occurs at longer wavelengths (or lower frequencies).
This is why objects glow with a red color at around 1000 K. It is found experimen-
tally that the wavelength at the peak of the spectrum,
is related to the Kelvin
temperature T by
(27;2)
This is known as Wien’s law.
The Sun’s surface temperature. Estimate the tempera-
ture of the surface of our Sun, given that the Sun emits light whose peak intensity
occurs in the visible spectrum at around 500 nm.
APPROACH We assume the Sun acts as a blackbody, and use
in
Wien’s law (Eq. 27–2).
SOLUTION Wien’s law gives
Star color. Suppose a star has a surface temperature of
32,500 K. What color would this star appear?
APPROACH We assume the star emits radiation as a blackbody, and solve for
in Wien’s law, Eq. 27–2.
SOLUTION From Wien’s law we have
The peak is in the UV range of the spectrum, and will be way to the left
