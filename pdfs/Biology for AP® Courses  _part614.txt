CHAPTER SUMMARY
5.1 Components and Structure
The modern understanding of the plasma membrane is referred to as the fluid mosaic model. The plasma membrane is
composed of a bilayer of phospholipids, with their hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with each other. The landscape
of the membrane is studded with proteins, some of which span the membrane. Some of these proteins serve to transport
materials into or out of the cell. Carbohydrates are attached to some of the proteins and lipids on the outward-facing
surface of the membrane, forming complexes that function to identify the cell to other cells. The fluid nature of the
membrane is due to temperature, the configuration of t
