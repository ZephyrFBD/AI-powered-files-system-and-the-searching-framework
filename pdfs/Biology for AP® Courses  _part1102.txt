NO and
Ca2+ in the signal response to changes in the
concentrations of these hormones activate transcription
factors that affect ion transport across guard cell
membranes. High CO2 levels and light also alter
phytohormone concentrations.
A. Explain why plants must regulate the opening and
closing of stomata. Explain how this response relates to
the capture of free energy for cellular processes.
B. Construct an explanation in terms of the water
potential, Y, for the efflux (outward flow) of H+ during
water stress (drought).
C. Consider a scenario involving environmental factors,
such as water stress and daylight, which have opposing
effects on the opening and closing of stomata; stomata
would be signaled to close under drought conditions and to
open during photosynthesis. Pose two scientific questions
regarding the response of the system, one involving the
phytohormones ABA and ACC, and the second involving
the concentration of second messengers.
D. The data shown in the table below wer
