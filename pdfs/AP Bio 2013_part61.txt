tant in maintaining 
homeostasis in mammals. ADH is released from the 
hypothalamus in response to high tissue osmolarity. In 
response to ADH, the collecting duct and distal tubule in the 
kidney become more permeable to water, which increases 
water reabsorption into the capillaries. The amount of 
hormone released is controlled by a negative feedback loop. 
  Based on the model presented, which of the following 
statements expresses the proper relationship between 
osmolarity, ADH release, and urine production? 
(A) As tissue osmolarity rises, more ADH is released, 
causing less water to be excreted as urine. 
(B) As tissue osmolarity rises, less ADH is released, causing 
less water to be excreted as urine. 
(C) As tissue osmolarity rises, more ADH is released, 
causing more water to be excreted as urine. 
(D) As tissue osmolarity rises, less ADH is released, causing 
more water to be excreted as urine.
