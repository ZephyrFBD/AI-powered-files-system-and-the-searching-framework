ly water, so the process 
is the endothermic conversion of liquid water into water vapor:
H2O1l2 ¡  H2O1g2    ∆H = +44.0 kJ
The speed with which evaporative cooling occurs decreases 
as the atmospheric humidity increases, which is why we feel more 
sweaty and uncomfortable on hot, humid days.
When body temperature becomes too high, heat loss increases 
in two principal ways. First, blood flow near the skin surface increases, 
which allows for increased radiational and convective cooling. The red-
dish, “flushed” appearance of a hot individual is due to this increased 
blood flow. Second, we sweat, which increases evaporative cooling. 
During extreme activity, the amount of perspiration can be as high as 2 
to 4 liters per hour. As a result, the body’s water supply must be replen-
ished during these periods. If the body loses too much liquid through 
perspiration, it will no longer be able to cool itself and blood volume 
decreases, which can lead to either heat exhaustion or the more s
