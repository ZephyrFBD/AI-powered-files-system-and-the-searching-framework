ses besides growth would require cell division? How do cells 
divide? What must happen to ensure successful cell division? 
Write down the students’ answers on the whiteboard, but do not elaborate on their 
answers. The students will be expected to investigate these questions further throughout 
the lab. 
Students can use sockosomes, Pop-It Beads, clay, or pipe cleaners to review  
chromosome duplication and movement.  
■ Part 2: Effects of Environment on Mitosis 
Students will set up and analyze an experiment using onion bulbs based upon “
A 
Scenario-Based Study of Root Tip Mitosis”1. The exerise is supported by the premise that 
lectins increase the rate of mitosis in the roots. Lectins are proteins that bind to specific 
carbohydrate groups. Help students to identify the different cell phases before doing 
their onion root tips squashes (Figure 6).
