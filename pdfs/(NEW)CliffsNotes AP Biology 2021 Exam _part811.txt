elf with some important fruit fly characteristics:
1. Life cycle. Depending upon temperature, D. melanogaster requires 10 to 14 days to complete the stages from egg
to adult.
Eggs hatch into maggot-like larvae after about 1 day.
Larvae
Larvae day period. They molt (shed their skins) after the first two stages.
Pupae form after the third larval instar. A hardened outer case (cocoon) forms around the larva. Inside, a larva
undergoes metamorphosis and emerges as an adult fly after 5 to 6 days.
Adults may live for several weeks. Females may begin mating 10 hours after they emerge from the pupa.
2. Sex of fruit flies. To properly identify behavior that may be sexdependent, you must be able to distinguish the
males from the females. The following typical (but variable) characteristics are used:
A female is larger than a male and has four to six solid dark stripes across the dorsal side (top) of her abdomen. The
posterior end of the abdomen is somewhat pointed.
A male is smaller than a female
