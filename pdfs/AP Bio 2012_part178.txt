(Part b) The student is able to identify, explain, or describe 
several consequences of viral infection on individual plants 
and provide justification. Predictions may include, but are 
not limited to, stunted growth due to lack of energy needed 
for building molecules; inability to grow, repair tissues, and 
reproduce due to lack of usable free energy; and likelihood 
of the plant weakening or dying if energy demands cannot 
be met once the plant uses up pre-infection energy stores. 
(Part c) The student is able to explain how a change in one 
component (e.g., virus, plant species) of a biological system 
(e.g., plant, prairie community) affects the community as a 
whole with respect to matter and energy flow. The student 
is able to predict several potential effects — both negative 
and positive — of short-term change due to a viral infection 
on the plant population and prairie community and justify 
those predictions. For example, the student may explain 
how a v
