open the
stomata) of grasses before and aȇer CO2 enrichment. The results show
that over the first two years, C3 grasses experienced a 14% change in
plant height and a −36% change in stomatal conductance.
Based on these findings, which of the following phenomena would not be
aﬀected in the grasses in the FACE experiment?
Photosynthetic rates
(A)
Water loss from the leaf surface
(B)
Water transport through the xylem 
(C)
Active uptake of potassium
(D)
2. A novel antibacterial drug is isolated from a newly discovered species of
fungus. While the drug is able to enter into both bacterial and human
cells by endocytosis, the drug only degrades DNA in bacteria, so it is safe
to use in humans. Which of the following could be a plausible explanation
for why only bacteria are aﬀected?
Bacteria have cell walls, which makes bacteria more susceptible to
drugs.
(A)
DNA is protected when wrapped around histones, which only
prokaryotes have.
(B)
The drug causes lysosomes, which are not found in eukary
