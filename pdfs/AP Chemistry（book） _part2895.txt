coal and oil, on 
a prodigious scale in the modern era has sharply increased carbon dioxide levels in the 
atmosphere. To get a sense of the amount of CO2 produced—for example, by the com-
bustion of hydrocarbons and other carbon-containing substances, which are the compo-
nents of fossil fuels—consider the combustion of butane, C4H10. Combustion of 1.00 g 
of C4H10 produces 3.03 g of CO2. 
 (Section 3.6). Combustion of fossil fuels releases 
about 2.2 * 1016 g (24 billion tons) of CO2 into the atmosphere annually, with the larg-
est quantity coming from transportation vehicles.
