Some Typical Answers to Short Questions
1. Eukaryotic organisms are often multicellular. As a result, gene regulation must be able to regulate gene
expression specific to cell type. Eukaryotes also have more than one chromosome, requiring simultaneous regulation
of multiple genes on different chromosomes when they all contribute to a metabolic pathway.
2. In many cases, no new amino acid is designated if the mutation is a substitution in the third position of the mRNA
codon. More than one codon often codes for the same amino acid, and the third position is the most variable (wobble
pairing).
3. Yes. The traditional fingerprint can distinguish identical twins because the expression of dermal ridges (the ridges
on your skin that make fingerprints) are the product of genes whose expression has been modified by gene
regulation. Gene regulation is often influenced by environmental factors that differ between identical twins during
