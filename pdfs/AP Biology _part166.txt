te their DNA and divide.

(D) Normal human skin cells constantly divide by mitosis to repair
damage to the skin. Choices A, B, and C are all characteristics of
meiosis and human cells do not undergo meiosis. Meiotic cell
division produces gametes only. (IST-1)
(D) Choice D correctly describes what happens to a cell that
undergoes mitosis without cytokinesis. In fact, this is what happens
in human skeletal muscle cells. It explains how the cells end up
being multinucleated and very large. (IST 1)
(C) Disruption of actin, a type of microfilament, would impair or
block cytokinesis, the formation of the cleavage furrow or cell plate
(in plants) and thereby prevent cell division. Spindle fibers, which
connect chromosomes from the metaphase plate to centrioles,

consist of microtubules, not microfilaments. DNA synthesis does not
involve microfilaments. The condensing of chromosomes does not
require microfilaments either.
