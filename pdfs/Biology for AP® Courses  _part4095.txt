in the animal body. This process is called organogenesis. Organogenesis is characterized by rapid and precise movements
of the cells within the embryo.
Organogenesis
Organs form from the germ layers through the process of differentiation. During differentiation, the embryonic stem cells
express specific sets of genes which will determine their ultimate cell type. For example, some cells in the ectoderm
will express the genes specific to skin cells. As a result, these cells will differentiate into epidermal cells. The process of
differentiation is regulated by cellular signaling cascades.
Scientists study organogenesis extensively in the lab in fruit flies (Drosophila) and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.
Drosophila have segments along their bodies, and the patterning associated with the segment formation has allowed
