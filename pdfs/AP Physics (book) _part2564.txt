efraction) through the focal point.
To determine an image point, we can consider only the three rays indicated in
Fig. 23–37, which uses an arrow (on the left) as the object, and a converging lens
forming an image (dashed arrow) to the right. These rays, emanating from a single
point on the object, are drawn as if the lens were infinitely thin, and we show only
a single sharp bend at the center line of the lens instead of the refractions at each
surface. These three rays are drawn as follows:
Ray 1 is drawn parallel to the axis, Fig. 23–37a; therefore it is refracted by the
lens so that it passes along a line through the focal point F behind the lens.
Ray 2 is drawn to pass through the other focal point 
(front side of lens 
in Fig. 23–37) and emerge from the lens parallel to the axis, Fig. 23–37b.
(In reverse it would be a parallel ray going left and passing through 
.)
Ray 3 is directed toward the very center of the lens, where the two surfaces are
essentially parallel to each other,
