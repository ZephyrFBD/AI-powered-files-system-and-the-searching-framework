 stars (see Chapter 33) where the temperature is extremely high, corresponding
to high KE (Eq. 13â€“8). Today fusion is still producing the prodigious amounts of
light energy (EM waves) stars emit, including our Sun.
Fusion energy release. One of the simplest fusion reac-
tions involves the production of deuterium,
from a neutron and a proton:
How much energy is released in this reaction?
APPROACH The energy released equals the difference in mass (times 
)
between the initial and final masses.
SOLUTION From Appendix B, the initial mass is
and after the reaction the mass is that of the 
namely 2.014102 u (the 
is
massless). The mass difference is
so the energy released is
and it is carried off by the 
nucleus and the ray.
The energy output of our Sun is believed to be due principally to the following
sequence of fusion reactions:
(31;6a)
(31;6b)
(31;6c)
where the energy released (Q-value) for each reaction is given in parentheses.
These reactions are between nuclei (without electrons at t
