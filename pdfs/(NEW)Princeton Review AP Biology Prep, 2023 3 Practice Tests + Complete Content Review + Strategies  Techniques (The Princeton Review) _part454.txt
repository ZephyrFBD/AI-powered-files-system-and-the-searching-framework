s particularly harmful because it resists chemical breakdown, and it can still be found in
tissues of nearly every living organism. The danger with toxins such as DDT is that as each trophic level
consumes DDT, the substance becomes more concentrated by the process of biomagnification.
Reduction in biodiversity: As different habitats have been destroyed, many plants and animals have become
extinct. Some of these plants could have provided us with medicines and products that may have been
beneficial.
Introduction and Spread of Disease: Humans travel and disrupt habitats and bring diseases with them. These
diseases can devastate all types of living things and act as immediate selective pressures, leaving the landscape
of an ecosystem forever changed.
Acid rain, deforestation, pollution, soil erosion, and depletion of the ozone
layer are just a few of the problems plaguing the environment today.
