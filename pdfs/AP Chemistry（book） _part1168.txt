tals.
The noble gases (group 8A) exist as monatomic gases. They are 
very unreactive because they have completely filled s and p subshells. 
Only the heaviest noble gases are known to form compounds, and 
they do so only with very active nonmetals, such as fluorine.
Learning Outcomes After studying this chapter, you should be able to:
t Explain the meaning of effective nuclear charge, Zeff, and how 
Zeff depends on nuclear charge and electron configuration. (Sec-
tion 7.2) Related Exercises: 7.13–7.15, 7.17
t Use the periodic table to predict the trends in atomic radii, ionic 
radii, ionization energy, and electron affinity. (Sections 7.2, 7.3, 
7.4, and 7.5) Related Exercises: 7.26, 7.42, 7.44, 7.53
t Explain how the radius of an atom changes upon losing elec-
trons to form a cation or gaining electrons to form an anion. 
(Section 7.3) Related Exercises: 7.28, 7.33–7.35
t Use the periodic table to determine the electron configurations 
of ions. (Section 7.3) Related Exercises: 7.2
