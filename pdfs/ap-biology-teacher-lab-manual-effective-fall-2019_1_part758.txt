substances to the choice chamber unless your teacher has approved them.
• If the substance you add is flammable, such as ethanol, use precaution and do not 
conduct your experiment near a heat source or flame.
• Many of the substances used in this experiment are food items, but you should not 
consume any of them.
• Fruit flies are living organisms that should not be released to the environment. After 
all the investigations are complete, flies should be tapped into a “morgue” through a 
funnel. The morgue typically is a 150-mL beaker that contains about 50 mL of salad 
oil or 70% alcohol. 
  
 
 
■ THE INVESTIGATIONS  
■ Getting Started 
This procedure is designed to help you understand how to work with fruit flies. You may 
start with general information about how to determine the sex of a fruit fly. How do 
you tell the difference between male and female flies? Is the sex of the fly important to 
your investigations? Look at the female and male fruit flies in Figure 1. Then look at
