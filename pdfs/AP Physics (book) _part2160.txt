72. Suppose that a person’s body resistance is 
(moist skin).
(a) What current passes through the body when the person
accidentally is connected to 120 V? (b) If there is an alterna-
tive path to ground whose resistance is 
, what then is
the current through the body? (c) If the voltage source can
produce at most 1.5 A, how much current passes through the
person in case (b)?
73. One way a multiple-speed ventilation fan for a car can be
designed is to put resistors in series with the fan motor.
The resistors reduce the current through the motor and
make it run more slowly. Suppose the current in the motor
is 5.0 A when it is connected directly across a 12-V battery.
(a) What series resistor should be used to reduce the
current to 2.0 A for low-speed operation? (b) What power
rating should the resistor have? Assume that the motor’s
resistance is roughly the same at all speeds.
74. A Wheatstone bridge is a type of “bridge circuit” used to
make measurements of resistance. The
