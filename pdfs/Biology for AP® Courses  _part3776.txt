Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is consistent with the
assumption of no change in the distribution of alleles
over time. Justify the selection of data that should
be obtained to further test this assumption.
Homologous genes coding for the carbohydrates that are
presented on the surfaces of red blood cells are found in
amphibians and mammals but not in fish, implying a last
common ancestor for the ABO gene system at least 20
million years ago.
E. The difference between genes coding for A and B is a
single nucleotide replacement. Evaluate the likelihood
that negative selection pressures have been active in the
evolution of this system.
45. The immune system rejection of transplanted organs
and the availability of organ donors are key factors in
determining survival. Blood ABO compatibility is always
a criterion in matching do
