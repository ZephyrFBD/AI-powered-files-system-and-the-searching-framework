40. Some cells release active signaling proteins when
membrane-bound precursor proteins are cleaved
by proteolytic enzymes. The signaling proteins
can then bind to receptors on the surface of
a target cell, thereby activating an intracellular
signaling pathway and eliciting a response from
the target cell.
This mechanism of activating receptor-binding
signaling proteins has been observed in a variety
of organisms from bacteria to humans. Many
of the enzymes responsible for proteolysis of
membrane-bound precursor proteins have been
isolated and characterized.
