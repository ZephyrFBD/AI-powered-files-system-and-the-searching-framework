lial cells appear only in the urinary system, primarily in the bladder and ureter. These cells are
arranged in a stratified layer, but they have the capability of appearing to pile up on top of each other in a relaxed, empty
bladder, as illustrated in Figure 24.11. As the urinary bladder fills, the epithelial layer unfolds and expands to hold the
volume of urine introduced into it. As the bladder fills, it expands and the lining becomes thinner. In other words, the tissue
transitions from thick to thin.

Figure 24.11 Transitional epithelia of the urinary bladder undergo changes in thickness depending on how full the
bladder is.
An empty bladder is composed of piled up transitional cells with a folded epithelial lining. What would you predict
happens to those cells as the bladder fills with urine?
a.
The epithelial lining unfolds and becomes thicker.
