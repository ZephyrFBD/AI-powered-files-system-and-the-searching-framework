cyclin B, control these checkpoints. The phosphorylation of cyclin B, a post-translational event, alters its function. As a
result, cells can progress through the cell cycle unimpeded, even if mutations exist in the cell and its growth should be
terminated. This post-translational change of cyclin B prevents it from controlling the cell cycle and contributes to the
development of cancer.
Cancer: Disease of Altered Gene Expression
Cancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. There are many proteins that are turned on or off (gene
activation or gene silencing) that dramatically alter the overall activity of the cell. A gene that is not normally expressed
in that cell can be switched on and expressed at high levels. This can be the result of gene mutation or changes in gene
regulation (epigenetic, transcription, post-transcription, translation, or post-translation).
Changes in epigenetic regulation, transcription, RNA stability, protein translation, and post-transla
