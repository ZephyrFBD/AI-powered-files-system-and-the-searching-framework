b.
Complex IV contains a molecule of flavin
mononucleotide and iron-sulfur clusters. The
electrons from NADH are transported here to
coenzyme Q.
c.
Complex IV contains cytochrome b, c, and Fe-S.
Here, the proton motive Q cycle takes place.
d.
Complex IV contains a membrane-bound
enzyme that accepts electrons from FADH2 to
make FAD. This electron is then transferred to
ubiquinone.
36. What is the primary difference between fermentation
and anaerobic respiration?
a.
Fermentation uses only glycolysis and its final
electron acceptor is an organic molecule,
whereas anaerobic respiration uses glycolysis,
TCA and the ETC but finally give electrons to
an inorganic molecule.
