y inductive, aims to observe, explore, and discover, while
hypothesis-based science, which is usually deductive, begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or
solution that can be tested. The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, and most scientific endeavors
combine both approaches. The fuzzy boundary becomes apparent when thinking about how easily observation can lead to
specific questions. For example, a gentleman in the 1940s observed that the burr seeds that stuck to his clothes and his dog’s
fur had a tiny hook structure. On closer inspection, he discovered that the burrs’ gripping device was more reliable than a
zipper. He eventually developed a company and produced the hook-and-loop fastener often used on lace-less sneakers and
athletic braces. Descriptive science and hypothesis-based science are in continuous dialogue.
The Scientific Method
Biologists study the living world by posing questions about it and seeking science-based resp
