 bonding. Figure 12.25 No, ions of like charge do not touch 
in an ionic compound because they are repelled from one another. 
In an ionic compound the cations touch the anions. Figure 
12.27 In NaF there are four Na+ ions 112 * 1>42 and four F- ions 
18 * 1>8 + 6 * 1>22 per unit cell. In MgF2 there are two Mg2+ ions 
18 * 1>8 + 12 and four F- ions 14 * 1>2 + 22 per unit cell. In ScF3 
there is one Sc3 +  ion 18 * 1>82 and three F- ions 112 * 1>42 per 
unit cell. Figure 12.28 The intermolecular forces are stronger in 
toluene, as shown by its higher boiling point. The molecules pack 
more efficiently in benzene, which explains its higher melting 
point, even though the intermolecular forces are weaker.  
Figure 12.30 The band gap for an insulator would be larger than 
the one for a semiconductor. Figure 12.31 If you doubled the 
amount of doping in panel (b), the amount of blue shading the 
conduction band would also double. Figure 12.45 Decrease. As 
the quantum dots get smaller, the
