d whatever new alleles arise through mutation and gene flow.
Natural selection is also limited because it works at the level of individuals, not alleles, and some alleles are linked due
to their physical proximity in the genome, making them more likely to be passed on together (linkage disequilibrium).
Any given individual may carry some beneficial alleles and some unfavorable alleles. It is the net effect of these alleles,
or the organismâ€™s fitness, upon which natural selection can act. As a result, good alleles can be lost if they are carried
by individuals that also have several overwhelmingly bad alleles; likewise, bad alleles can be kept if they are carried by
individuals that have enough good alleles to result in an overall fitness benefit.
Furthermore, natural selection can be constrained by the relationships between different polymorphisms. One morph may
confer a higher fitness than another, but may not increase in frequency due to the fact that going from the less beneficial
