Students analyze pollen grains and fern spores recovered
from sediments taken below and above the Cretaceous-
Paleogene boundary. Their results are summarized in the
graph. Which of the following conclusions can be drawn
from the graph regarding the impact of the mass extinction
that took place at the K-Pg boundary on plants?
a.
The mass extinction event reduced the number
of ferns and angiosperms.
b.
Based on their reduced pollen counts found in
the samples, the mass extinction event clearly
reduced the number of ferns and angiosperms.
c.
The mass extinction affected only the ferns.
d.
Ferns were more abundant after the Cretaceous-
Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction than before.

Analyze the graph and discuss the reasons for the fern
spike seen in the early Paleogene, considering ferns were
the first plants seen on the ground after
