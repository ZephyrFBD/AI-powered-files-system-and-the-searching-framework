 (a) At which temperature or temperatures is the substance 
in a liquid crystalline state? At those temperatures, which 
type of liquid crystalline phase is depicted? (b) Which is the 
highest of these three temperatures? [Section 11.7]
Propyl alcohol
Isopropyl alcohol
and ethyl methyl ether 1CH3CH2OCH32 has a normal 
boiling point of 11 °C. (a) Explain why replacement of a 
hydrogen on the oxygen by a CH3 group generally results 
in a lower boiling point. (b) What are the major factors 
responsible for the difference in boiling points of the two 
ethers?
 11.28  Based on the type or types of intermolecular forces, predict 
the substance in each pair that has the higher boiling point: 
(a) propane 1C3H82 or n-butane 1C4H102, (b) diethyl ether 
1CH3CH2OCH2CH32 or 1-butanol 1CH3CH2CH2CH2OH2, 
(c) sulfur dioxide 1SO22 or sulfur trioxide 1SO32, (d) phos-
gene 1Cl2CO2 or formaldehyde 1H2C
