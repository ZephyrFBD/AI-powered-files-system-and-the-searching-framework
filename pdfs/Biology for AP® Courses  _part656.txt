 carbohydrates. The by-product of photosynthesis is oxygen, required
by some cells to carry out cellular respiration. During cellular respiration, oxygen aids in the catabolic
breakdown of carbon compounds, like carbohydrates. Among the products of this catabolism are CO2 and
ATP. In addition, some eukaryotes perform catabolic processes without oxygen (fermentation); that is, they
perform or use anaerobic metabolism.
Organisms probably evolved anaerobic metabolism to survive (living organisms came into existence about
3.8 billion years ago, when the atmosphere lacked oxygen). Despite the differences between organisms
and the complexity of metabolism, researchers have found that all branches of life share some of the
same metabolic pathways, suggesting that all organisms evolved from the same ancient common ancestor
(Figure 6.4). Evidence indicates that over time, the pathways diverged, adding specialized enzymes to
allow organisms to better adapt to their environment, thus increasing t
