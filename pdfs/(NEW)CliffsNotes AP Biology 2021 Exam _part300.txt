confirm this). Finally, a cross of the fourth gene, Dd × Dd,
produces ¼ DD, ½ Dd, and ¼ dd. To find the probability of AABbCcDd, first find the frequency for each gene
separately. The probability of AA is 1, of Bb is 1, of Cc is ½, and of Dd is ½. Then find the product of these
frequencies. For AABbCcDd the product is 1 × 1 × ½ × ½ = ¼.
13. C. Since the range of skin colors in humans shows continuous variation from very pale to very dark, it is most
likely coded by many genes (polygenic inheritance).
14. A. When two traits frequently occur together, then they are probably linked. Sometimes, a red-headed person
may not have freckles, or a freckled person may not have red hair. In these cases, there was probably a crossover
event, exchanging one of the two genes with an allele that did not code for freckles or red hair.
15. C. Answer choice C is the false statement. Since A and B are on one chromosome, then, by definition, they are
linked and answer choice A is true. Answer choice B is a
