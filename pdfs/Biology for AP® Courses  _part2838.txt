Figure 24.15 (a) Compact bone is a dense matrix on the outer surface of bone. Spongy bone, inside the compact
bone, is porous with web-like trabeculae. (b) Compact bone is organized into rings called osteons. Blood vessels,
nerves, and lymphatic vessels are found in the central Haversian canal. Rings of lamellae surround the Haversian
