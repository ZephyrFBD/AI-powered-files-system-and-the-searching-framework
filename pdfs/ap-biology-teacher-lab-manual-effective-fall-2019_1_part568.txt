ens of companies, hundreds of patents, and 
billions of dollars’ worth of research and development money depend on the answer. 
Not only does this investigation provide an opportunity for students to learn and apply 
techniques used by scientists in creating genetic profiles, it raises questions that students 
can explore about the ethical, social, and medical issues surrounding the manipulation of 
genetic information. 
In this investigation, students begin by familiarizing themselves with the procedure 
without running an actual gel electrophoresis. Then students will use restriction 
endonucleases and gel electrophoresis to analyze DNA sequences by creating genetic 
“fingerprints.” Students will apply mathematical routines to determine the approximate 
sizes of DNA fragments produced by restriction enzymes to solve the forensic mystery 
presented in the scenario. There are two parallel activities going on: conducting 
an investigation requiring technical skills and identifying likel
