. The pH of the resulting solution is 9.2. 
 
(a) Write the chemical equation and equilibrium-constant 
expression for the reaction between HA and B. (b) If Ka for 
HA is 8.0 * 10-5, what is the value of the equilibrium con-
stant for the reaction between HA and B? (c) What is the 
value of Kb for B?
 17.88  Two buffers are prepared by adding an equal number 
of moles of formic acid (HCOOH) and sodium formate 
(HCOONa) to enough water to make 1.00 L of solution. 
Buffer A is prepared using 1.00 mol each of formic acid and 
sodium formate. Buffer B is prepared by using 0.010 mol of 
each. (a) Calculate the pH of each buffer. (b) Which buf-
fer will have the greater buffer capacity? (c) Calculate the 
change in pH for each buffer upon the addition of 1.0 mL 
of 1.00 M HCl. (d) Calculate the change in pH for each buf-
fer upon the addition of 10 mL of 1.00 M HCl.
