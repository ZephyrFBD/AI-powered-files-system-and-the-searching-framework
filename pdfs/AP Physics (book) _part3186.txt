tion on a
CD or DVD is a series of pits and spaces representing 0s and 1s (or “off” and “on”)
of a binary code (Section 17–10) that is decoded electronically before being sent
to the audio or video system. The laser of a CD player starts reading at the inside
of the disc which rotates at about 500 rpm at the start. As the disc rotates, the
laser follows the spiral track (Fig. 28–21b), and as it moves outward the disc must
slow down because each successive circumference 
is slightly longer
as r increases; at the outer edge, the disc is rotating about 200 rpm. A 1-hour CD
has a track roughly 5 km long; the track width is about 
and
the distance between pits is about 800 nm. DVDs contain much more information.
