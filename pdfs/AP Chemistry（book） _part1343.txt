, Te, 
I, and B. (a) Which two would form the most polar single 
bond? (b) Which two would form the longest single bond? 
(c) Which two would be likely to form a compound of for-

 8.86 The substance chlorine monoxide, ClO(g), is important in 
atmospheric processes that lead to depletion of the ozone 
layer. The ClO molecule has an experimental dipole mo-
ment of 1.24 D, and the Cl¬ O bond length is 1.60 Å. (a) 
Determine the magnitude of the charges on the Cl and O 
atoms in units of the electronic charge, e. (b) Based on the 
electronegativities of the elements, which atom woul
