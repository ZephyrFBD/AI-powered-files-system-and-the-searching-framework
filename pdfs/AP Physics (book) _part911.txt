Arches and Domes
Our whole built environment,
from modern bridges to 
skyscrapers, has required 
architects and engineers to 
determine the forces and 
stresses within these structures.
The object is to keep these 
structures standing, or 
“static”—that is, not in 
motion, especially not falling 
down.
The study of statics applies
equally well to the human 
body, including balance, the 
forces in muscles, joints, and 
bones, and ultimately the 
possibility of fracture.

at A and B?
