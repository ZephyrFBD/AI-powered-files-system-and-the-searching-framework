try to find those that contain the greatest number of 
fossils  
(B) Collecting fossils from rock layers deposited prior to the Permian period that contain some early vertebrate 
bones 
(C) Looking in sedimentary layers next to bodies of water in order to find marine fossils of bivalves and 
trilobites 
(D) Using relative dating techniques to determine the geological ages of the fossils found so they can calculate 
the rate of speciation of early organisms

59. Anabaena is a simple multicellular photosynthetic cyanobacterium. In the absence of fixed nitrogen, certain 
newly developing cells along a filament express genes that code for nitrogen-fixing enzymes and become non-
photosynthetic heterocysts. The specialization is advantageous because some nitrogen-fixing enzymes function 
best in the absence of oxygen. Heterocysts do not carry out photosynthesis but instead provide adjacent cells 
with fixed nitrogen, in exchange receiving fix
