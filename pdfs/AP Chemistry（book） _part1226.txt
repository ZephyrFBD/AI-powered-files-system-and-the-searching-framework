Sodium chloride is composed of Na+ and Cl- ions arranged in a three-dimensional array 
(Figure 8.4).
The formation of Na+ from Na and Cl- from Cl2 indicates that an electron has been 
lost by a sodium atom and gained by a chlorine atom—we say there has been an electron 
transfer from the Na atom to the Cl atom. Two of the atomic properties discussed in 
Chapter 7 give us an indication of how readily electron transfer occurs: ionization energy, 
which indicates how easily an electron can be removed from an atom; and electron affinity, 
which measures how much an atom wants to gain an electron. 
 (Sections 7.4 and 7.5) 
Electron transfer to form oppositely charged ions occurs when one atom readily gives up an 
electron (low ionization energy) and another atom readily gains an electron (high electron 
affinity). Thus, NaCl is a typical ionic compound because it consists of a metal of low ioniza-
tion energy and a nonmetal of high electron affinity. Using Lewis ele
