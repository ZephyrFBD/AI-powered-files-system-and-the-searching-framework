epted by a majority of biologists as the mechanism whereby eukaryotic
cells obtained their mitochondria and chloroplasts. However, the role of endosymbiosis in the development of the nucleus is
more controversial. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA are thought to be of different (separate) evolutionary origin, with the
mitochondrial DNA being derived from the circular genomes of bacteria that were engulfed by ancient prokaryotic cells.
Mitochondrial DNA can be regarded as the smallest chromosome. Interestingly enough, mitochondrial DNA is inherited
only from the mother. The mitochondrial DNA degrades in sperm when the sperm degrades in the fertilized egg or in other
instances when the mitochondria located in the flagellum of the sperm fails to enter the egg.
Within the past decade, the process of genome fusion by endosymbiosis has been proposed by James Lake of the UCLA/
NASA Astrobiology Institute to be responsible for the evolution of the first eukaryotic cells (Figure 20.15a). Using
