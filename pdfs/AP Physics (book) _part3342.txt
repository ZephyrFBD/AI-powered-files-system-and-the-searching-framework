 it “lacks”
relative to the total mass of its separate constituents.
[As a comparison, we saw in Chapter 27 that the binding energy of the one
electron in the hydrogen atom is 13.6 eV; so the mass of a 
atom is less 
than that of a single proton plus a single electron by 
The binding
energies of nuclei are on the order of MeV, so the eV binding energies of elec-
trons can be ignored. Nuclear binding energies, compared to nuclear masses, are
on the order of
where we used helium’s binding
energy of 28.3 MeV (see above) and mass

EXERCISE A Determine how much less the mass of the 
nucleus is compared to that
of its constituents. See Appendix B.
The binding energy per nucleon is defined as the total binding energy of a
nucleus divided by A, the total number of nucleons. We calculated above that 
the binding energy of 
is 28.3 MeV, so its binding energy per nucleon is
Figure 30–1 shows the measured binding energy per
nucleon as a function of A for stable nuclei. The curve rises as A increa
