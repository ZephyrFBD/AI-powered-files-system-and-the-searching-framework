sts possess both chloroplasts (organelle A)
and mitochondria (organelle B). (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect
because bacteria lack membrane-bound organelles. (C) and (D) are
incorrect because heterotrophs and fungi (which are a type of
heterotroph) lack chloroplasts.
24. A
High rates of crossover occur between genes on the same
chromosome only when they are located far apart from each other. (A)
is correct. (B) and (C)Â are incorrect because the dominance or
recessivity of the genes has no impact on their recombination
frequency. (D) is incorrect because it does not rule out the possibility
that the two genes are both far from the centromere on the same side,
which would mean the two genes are relatively close to one another.
25. C
Early Earth is believed to have been a site of frequent thunderstorms
and, indeed, one of the first experiments that synthesized organic
molecules from inorganic precursors relied upon electric current as a
catalyst. Thus, it is reasonable to believe tha
