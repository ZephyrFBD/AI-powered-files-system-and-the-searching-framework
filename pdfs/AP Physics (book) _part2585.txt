culating f for a converging lens. A convex meniscus
lens (Figs. 23–31a and 23–46) is made from glass with
The radius of
curvature of the convex surface (left in Fig. 23–46) is 22 cm. The surface on the
right is concave with radius of curvature 46 cm. What is the focal length?
APPROACH We use the lensmaker’s equation, Eq. 23–10, to find f.
SOLUTION
and
(concave surface). Then
So
and the lens is converging since
NOTE If we turn the lens around so that
and
we
get the same result.
NOTE Because Eq.23–10 gives 1/f, it gives directly the power of a lens in diopters,
Eq. 23–7. The power of this lens is about 1.2 D.

Light: Geometric Optics
Light appears to travel along straight-line paths, called rays,
through uniform transparent materials including air and glass.
When light reflects from a flat surface, the angle of ref
