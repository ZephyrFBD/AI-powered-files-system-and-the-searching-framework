EXERCISE A Put
into the equation of Example Aâ€“2 and show that it 
works too.
Two or More Unknowns
If we have two or more unknowns, one equation is not sufficient to find them.
In general, if there are n unknowns, n independent equations are needed. For
example, if there are two unknowns, we need two equations. If the unknowns 
are called x and y, a typical procedure is to solve one equation for x in terms of y,
and substitute this into the second equation.
Solve the following pair of equations for x and y:
APPROACH We have two unknowns and two equations; we can start by
solving the second equation for x in terms of y. Then we substitute this result 
for x into the first equation.
SOLUTION We subtract 4y from both sides of the second equation:
We substitute this expression for x into the first equation, and simplify:
(carried out the multiplication by 3)
(added 9 to both sides)
(divided both sides by 
)
Now that we know
we substitute this into the expression for x:
Our solution is
We
