The volume in the lung can be divided into four units: tidal volume, expiratory reserve volume, inspiratory reserve volume,
and residual volume. Tidal volume (TV) measures the amount of air that is inspired and expired during a normal breath.
On average, this volume is around one-half liter, which is a little less than the capacity of a 20-ounce drink bottle. The
expiratory reserve volume (ERV) is the additional amount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation. It is the
