porization 
is about 88 J>mol@K. (a) Estimate the normal boiling point 
of bromine, Br2, by determining ∆H°
vap for Br2 using data 
from Appendix C. Assume that ∆H°
vap remains constant 
with temperature and that Trouton’s rule holds. (b) Look up 
the normal boiling point of Br2 in a chemistry handbook or 
at the WebElements website (www.webelements.com) and 
compare it to your calculation. What are the possible sources 
of error, or incorrect assumptions, in the calculation?
 [19.94]  (a) Write the chemical equations that correspond to ∆G°
f  
for NH3( g) and for CO( g). (b) For which of these formation 
reactions will the value of ∆G°
f  be more positive (less neg-
ative) than ∆H°
f  ? (c) In general, under which condition is 
∆G°
f  more positive (less negative) than ∆H°
f  ? (i) When the 
temperature is high, (ii) when the reaction is reversible, (iii) 
when ∆S°
f  is negative.
 19.95  Consider the following three reactions:
(i) 
Ti1s2 + 2 Cl21g2 ¡ TiCl41g2
(ii) C2H61g2 + 7 Cl21g2
