rad has four chromatids.
Once the tetrads are formed, homologous chromosomes may exchange genetic information through the process
of genetic recombination (or crossing-over). This generates new combinations of genetic material on each chromatid
that may be passed on to the offspring. This increases the genetic diversity of the species, as shown in Figure 12.3.
Figure 12.3 Genetic Recombination (Crossing-Over)
The frequency of genetic recombination events can be used to estimate the distance between genes that are on the
same chromosome. Genes that are farther apart will have a higher recombination frequency, and genes that are
closer to each other will have a lower recombination frequency. The frequency of genetic recombination between
genes on the same chromosome can be used to generate genetic maps that show the relative positions of genes on
chromosomes. Genes that are close together on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together more often
(since the frequency of recombinatio
