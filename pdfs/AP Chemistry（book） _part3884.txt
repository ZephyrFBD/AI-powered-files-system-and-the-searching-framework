her. The 
most important polysaccharides are starch, glycogen, and cellulose, all three of which 
are formed from repeating glucose units.
Starch is not a pure substance. The term refers to a group of polysaccharides found 
in plants. Starches serve as a major method of food storage in plant seeds and tubers. 
Corn, potatoes, wheat, and rice all contain substantial amounts of starch. These plant 
products serve as major sources of needed food energy for humans. Enzymes in the diges-
tive system catalyze the hydrolysis of starch to glucose.
Some starch molecules are unbranched chains, whereas others are branched. Fig-
ure 24.22(a) illustrates an unbranched starch structure. Notice, in particular, that the
