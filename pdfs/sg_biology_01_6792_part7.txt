Alveolus 
* Air sac OR 
* Thin (single-celled) layer 
• simple, squamous, epithelial cells 
• moist permeable membrane 
• surfactant 
• thin basement membrane 
 
 
* Allows gas diffusion (site to site) 
• surface area (High SA/V ratio) 
• close association with capillaries 
• reduces surface tension, prevents 
collapse of alveolus 
• enhance diffusion 
 
 
* Increases amount of surface area 
which allows for the exchange of 
gases in respiratory system
