s than 10. For 
example, if we begin with 0.0048 and move the decimal point three places to the right, 
we end up with 4.8 * 10-3.
In the system of exponential notation, with each shift of the decimal point one 
place to the right, the exponent decreases by 1:
4.8 * 10-3 = 48 * 10-4
Similarly, with each shift of the decimal point one place to the left, the exponent 
increases by 1:
4.8 * 10-3 = 0.48 * 10-2
Many scientific calculators have a key labeled EXP or EE, which is used to enter num-
bers in exponential notation. To enter the number 5.8 * 103 on such a calculator, the 
key sequence is

On some calculators the display will show 5.8, then a space, followed by 03, the 
exponent. On other calculators, a small 10 is shown with an exponent 3.
To enter a negative exponent, use the key labeled + > - . For example, to enter the 
number 8.6 * 10-5, the key sequence is

When entering a number in exponential notation, do not key in the 10 if you use the
