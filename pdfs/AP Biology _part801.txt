contained one nucleus plus the cytoplasm. Then, it divided into an
embryo of cells, each with its own cytoplasm. What this experiment
demonstrates is the importance of the cytoplasm to normal
embryonic development. Some substance in the gray crescent cells
determined the development of neighboring cells by altering the
expression of some genes. Choice (A) is not correct because the
embryos only needed half of the gray crescent to develop normally.
Choice (B) is not correct because each embryo needed some of the
gray crescent. All cells in an organism contain the same genes, so
choice (D) is incorrect.
(B) The allantois is analogous to the placenta in mammals and also
serves as the repository for uric acid, the nitrogenous waste from the
embryo that accumulates until the chick hatches.
(A) The yolk sac contains the yolk, which provides food for the
growing bird embryo until it hatches.
(D) The chorion is a thin membrane that lies just under the shell in a
birdâ€™s egg. Oxygen and carbon d
