ey tissue. What would
likely occur to the osmolarity of the filtrate in the
ascending limb if the active transport of NaCl stopped?
a.
Filtrate osmolarity would increase, then
decrease.
b.
Filtrate osmolarity would stay the same.
c.
Filtrate osmolarity would decrease.
d.
Filtrate osmolarity would increase.

The diagram models the countercurrent exchange
mechanism within the loop of Henle. The numbers within
the loop show the osmolarity of the filtrate, while the
numbers between the two loops indicate the osmolarity of
the interstitial fluid within the kidney tissue. What would
happen to the osmolarity of the interstitial fluid if water
could not exit the descending limb?
a.
Osmolarity of the interstitial fluid would
increase.
b.
Osmolarity of the interstitial fluid would
decrease.
c.
There would be no change in the osmolarity.
d.
Osmolarity would increase or decrease
depending upon the amount of water.
