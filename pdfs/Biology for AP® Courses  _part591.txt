pectively.
Both are pumps.
Figure 5.17 A uniporter carries one molecule or ion. A symporter carries two different molecules or ions, both in the
same direction. An antiporter also carries two different molecules or ions, but in different directions. (credit: modification

The primary active transport that functions with the active transport of sodium and potassium allows
secondary active transport to occur. The second transport method is still considered active because it
depends on the use of energy as does primary transport (illustrative example).

(electrogenic transport). (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
One of the most important pumps in animal cells is the sodium-potassium pump (Na+-K+ ATPase), which
maintains the electrochemical gradient (and the correct conc
