energy. (a) What color is the emitted light? 
(b) Would appropriately sized CdS quantum dots be able to 
emit blue light? (c) What about red light?
 12.97  Indicate whether each statement is true or false:
(a) The band gap of a semiconductor decreases as the parti-
cle size decreases in the 1–10-nm range.
(b) The light that is emitted from a semiconductor, upon 
external stimulation, becomes longer in wavelength as 
the particle size of the semiconductor decreases.
 12.98  Indicate whether this statement is true or false:
 
 If you want a semiconductor that emits blue light, you 
could either use a material that has a band gap correspond-
ing to the energy of a blue photon or you could use a mate-
rial that has a smaller band gap but make an appropriately 
sized nanoparticle of the same material.
 12.99 Gold adopts a face-centered cubic structure with a unit cell 
edge of 4.08 Å (Figure 12.11). How many gold atoms are 
there in a sphere that is 20 nm in diameter? Recall that the
