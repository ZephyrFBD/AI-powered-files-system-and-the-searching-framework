glycolysis

C. The life cycle of the human parasite Trypanosoma
brucei is divided between the body of the tsetse fly and the
human blood stream. The parasite causes “sleeping
sickness” in Sub-Saharan Africa. Within the human
bloodstream, the parasite depends on glycolysis, with
enzymes compartmentalized in a membrane-bound
organelle called the glycosome. In the insect host, the
parasite utilizes glycolysis as well as substrate-level and
oxidative phosphorylation. Explain the advantage of a life
cycle in the human host that employs anaerobic respiration
with a rate of free-energy production that is enhanced by
compartmentalization in the glycosome and a life cycle in
the insect host that is aerobic.
D. Predict the advantages of a biological system that uses
