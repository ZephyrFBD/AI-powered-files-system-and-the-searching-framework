gh the membrane
to allow the passage of a specific molecule. These ligands can be
neurotransmitters or peptide hormones, and the molecules that pass
through are oȇen ions, such as sodium (Na+) or potassium (K+), which can
alter the charge across the membrane. The ion channels, or pores, are
opened only for a short time, aȇer which the ligand dissociates from the
receptor and the receptor is available once again for a new ligand to bind.
G-protein-linked channels cause G-proteins to dissociate from the
cytoplasmic side of the receptor protein and bind to a nearby enzyme.
Ion-Channel-Linked Receptors
This enzyme continues the signaling cascade by inducing changes in
other intracellular molecules. In addition, it can also cause other
membrane channels to open in areas some distance from the originating
receptor.
Most G-proteins activate what are known as second messengers, small
intracellular molecules like cyclic AMP (cAMP), calcium, and phosphates,
which in turn activate key enzymes or
