ak base produces H+ upon hydro-
lysis. An anion that is the conjugate base of a weak acid produces 
OH- upon hydrolysis. Highly charged metal cations, such as Fe3+, 
are hydrated in water; the metal-bound water molecules undergo 
reaction with free water to make H3O+ and therefore are acidic.
ACID–BASE BEHAVIOR AND CHEMICAL STRUCTURE (SEC-
TION 16.10) The tendency of a substance to show acidic or basic 
characteristics in water can be correlated with its chemical struc-
ture. Acid character requires the presence of a highly polar H ¬ X 
bond. Acidity is also favored when the H ¬ X bond is weak and 
when the X- ion is very stable.
For oxyacids with the same number of OH groups and the same 
number of O atoms, acid strength increases with increasing electro-
negativity of the central atom. For oxyacids with the same central 
atom, acid strength increases as the number of oxygen atoms attached 
to the central atom increases. Carboxylic acids, which are organic acids 
containing the COOH g
