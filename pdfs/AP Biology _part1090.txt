Photosystem I (P700) Energy, with an average wavelength of 700 nm, is
absorbed in this photosystem and transferred to electrons that move to
a higher energy level.
Photosystem II (P680) Energy, with an average wavelength of 680 nm, is
absorbed in this photosystem and transferred to electrons that move to
a higher energy level.
Photosystems Light-harvesting complexes in the thylakoid membranes of
chloroplasts. They consist of a reaction center containing chlorophyll a
and a region containing several hundred antenna pigment molecules
that funnel energy into chlorophyll a.
Phycobilin A photosynthetic antenna pigment common in red and blue-
green algae.
Phylogeny Evolutionary history of a species or group of related species.
Phytochrome The photoreceptor responsible for keeping track of the
length of day and night. There are two forms of phytochrome, Pr (red
light absorbing) and Pfr (infrared light absorbing).
