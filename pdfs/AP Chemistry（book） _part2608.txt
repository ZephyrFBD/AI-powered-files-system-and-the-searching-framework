Acids in which OH groups and possibly additional oxygen atoms are bound to a central 
atom are called oxyacids. At first it may seem confusing that the OH group, which we 
know behaves as a base, is also present in some acids. Let’s take a closer look at what fac-
tors determine whether a given OH group behaves as a base or as an acid.
Consider an OH group bound to some atom Y, which might in turn have other 
groups attached to it:
O
H
Y
At one extreme, Y might be a metal, such as Na or Mg. Because of the low electronegativ-
ity of metals, the pair of electrons shared between Y and O is completely transferred to 
oxygen, and an ionic compound containing OH- is formed. Such compounds are there-
fore sources of OH- ions and behave as bases, as in NaOH and Mg1OH22.
When Y is a nonmetal, the bond to O is covalent and the substance does not read-
ily lose OH-. Instead, these compounds are either acidic or neutral. Generally, as the 
electr
