40. Which of the following best describes what 
happened to the otter population between 1750 
and 1850 ? 
(A) The population decreased in size as a result 
of a loss of genetic diversity. 
(B) The population decreased in size as a result 
of habitat loss. 
(C) The population lost genetic diversity as a 
result of a bottleneck effect. 
(D) The population lost genetic diversity as a 
result of the founder effect. 
41. Based on the information provided in the 
passage, which of the following best describes 
the effect of harmful algal blooms on otter 
populations? 
(A) They are a density-dependent factor that 
increases otter mortality in larger 
populations. 
(B) They are a density-dependent factor that 
reduces otter numbers at lower population 
sizes. 
(C) They are a density-independent factor that 
negatively affects the otter pop
