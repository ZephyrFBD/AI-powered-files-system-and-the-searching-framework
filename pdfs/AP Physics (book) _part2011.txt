action potential, so the action potential moves down the axon (Figs. 18–31c and d).
You may wonder if the number of ions that pass through the membrane would
significantly alter the concentrations. The answer is no; and we can show why (and
again show the power and usefulness of physics) by treating the axon as a capacitor
as we do in Search and Learn Problem 8 (the concentration changes by less than
1 part in 104).

An electric battery serves as a source of nearly constant poten-
tial difference by transforming chemical energy into electric
energy. A simple battery consists of two electrodes made of
different metals immersed in a solution or paste known as an
electrolyte.
