k adds ten electrons, 3d10. Finally, we move into the p block, whose principal 
quantum number is always the same as that of the s block. Counting the squares as we 
move across the p block to Se tells us that we need four electrons, 4p4. The electron con-
figuration for Se is therefore 3Ar44s23d104p4. This configuration can also be written with 
the subshells arranged in order of increasing principal quantum number: 3Ar43d104s24p4.
As a check, we add the number of electrons in the [Ar] core, 18, to the number of 
electrons we added to the 4s, 3d, and 4p subshells. This sum should equal the atomic 
number of Se, 34: 18 + 2 + 10 + 4 = 34.
What is the characteristic valence electron configuration of the group 7A elements, the halogens?
Sample Exercise 6.8 
Electron Configurations for a Group
SOLUTION
Analyze and Plan We first locate the halogens in the periodic table, 
write the electron configurations for the first two elements, and 
then determine the general similarity between the con
