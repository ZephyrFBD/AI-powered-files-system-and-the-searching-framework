Figure 17.18 Response of two ionic compounds to addition of a strong acid. (a) The solubility of  
PbF2 increases upon addition of acid. (b) The solubility of Pbl2 is not affected by the addition of  
acid. The water molecules and the anion of the strong acid have been omitted for clarity.

CHAPTER 17 Additional Aspects of Aqueous Equilibria
Formation of Complex Ions
A characteristic property of metal ions is their ability to act as Lewis acids toward water 
molecules, which act as Lewis bases. 
 (Section 16.11) Lewis bases other than water can 
also interact with metal ions, particularly transition-metal ions. Such interactions can 
dramatically affect the solubility of a metal salt. For example, AgCl 1Ksp = 1.8 * 10-102 
Tooth enamel consists mainly of the mineral hydroxyapatite, 
Ca101PO4261OH22, the hardest substance in the body. Tooth cavities 
form when acids dissolve tooth enamel:
Ca101PO4261OH221s2 + 8 H+1aq2 ¡
10 Ca2 +1aq
