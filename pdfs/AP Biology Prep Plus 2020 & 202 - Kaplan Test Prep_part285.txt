Plants have receptors on guard cell membranes that respond to light.
These allow the guard cells to become turgid as needed, opening the
stomata and allowing more carbon dioxide to diﬀuse in and oxygen to
diﬀuse out. This increased gas exchange allows for a higher rate of
photosynthesis, which would be reflected in higher sugar
concentrations measured in the leaves. (B) thus provides the most
plausible hypothesis, making it correct. (A) is incorrect because closing
the stomata would actually decrease the rate of photosynthesis since
there would be less input of carbon dioxide and less output of oxygen.
(C) and (D) are incorrect because cortical cells are not involved in the
regulation of stomata.

According to the graphs, significantly larger fruit is produced from
natural flowering induction in the Smooth Cayenne cultivar, for both
the AMI and NMI maturation approaches. Larger fruit growth means
