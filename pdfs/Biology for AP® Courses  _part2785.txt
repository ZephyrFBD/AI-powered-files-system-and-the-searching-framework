Groups of 20 seedlings from the same plant species were
treated with gibberellins. Each group received a different
concentration of hormone. The seedlings were grown
under the same environmental conditions. After 15 days of
growth, the internode distances between the first and
second sets of leaves were measured in each group of
seedlings. On this graph, the mean internode distance for
each group is plotted against the concentration of
gibberellins that the group received. According to the
results, why is this effect of gibberellins on internode
length used in agriculture to spray grapes with oversized
fruit?
a.
to lengthen the internode distance and
accommodate larger fruit
b.
to shorten the internode distance and
accommodate larger fruit
c.
to lengthen the internode distance and
accommodate more flowers
d.
to shorten the internod
