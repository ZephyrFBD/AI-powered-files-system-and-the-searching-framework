that is being transported. Channel proteins have hydrophilic domains exposed to the intracellular and
extracellular fluids; they additionally have a hydrophilic channel through their core that provides a hydrated opening
through the membrane layers (Figure 5.9). Passage through the channel allows polar compounds to avoid the nonpolar
central layer of the plasma membrane that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the cell. Aquaporins are channel
proteins that allow water to pass through the membrane at a very high rate.

membrane with the aid of channel proteins. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
Channel proteins are either open at all times or they are “gated,” which controls the opening of the channel. The attachment
of a particular ion to the channel protein may control the opening, or other mechanisms or substances may be involved.
