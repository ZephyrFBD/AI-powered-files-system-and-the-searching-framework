Cooling by radiation. An athlete is sitting
unclothed in a locker room whose dark walls are at a temperature of 15°C. Estimate
the body’s rate of heat loss by radiation, assuming a skin temperature of 34°C and
Take the surface area of the body not in contact with the chair to be 
APPROACH We use Eq. 14–7, which requires Kelvin temperatures.
