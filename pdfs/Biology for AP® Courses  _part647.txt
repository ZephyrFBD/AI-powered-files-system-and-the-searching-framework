ules (anabolism). A central example of these pathways is the synthesis and breakdown of glucose.
The content presented in this section supports the Learning Objectives outlined in Big Idea 1 and Big Idea 2 of the AP速
Biology Curriculum Framework listed below. The AP速 Learning Objectives merge Essential Knowledge content with one
or more of the seven Science Practices. These objectives provide a transparent foundation for the AP速 Biology course,
along with inquiry-based laboratory experiences, instructional activities, and AP速 exam questions.
