b position that is used to track kinesthesia (limb movement) are part of somatosensation. Although the
sensory systems associated with these senses are very different, all share a common function: to convert a stimulus (such as
light, or sound, or the position of the body) into an electrical signal in the nervous system. This process is called sensory
transduction.
There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction. In one, a neuron works with a sensory
receptor, a cell, or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus. Stimulation of the sensory
receptor activates the associated afferent neuron, which carries information about the stimulus to the central nervous
system. In the second type of sensory transduction, a sensory nerve ending responds to a stimulus in the internal or
external environment: this neuron constitutes the sensory receptor. Free nerve endings can be stimulated by several different
stimuli, thus showing l
