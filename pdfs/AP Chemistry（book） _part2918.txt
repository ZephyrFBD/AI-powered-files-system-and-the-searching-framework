icipal water supplies is restricted by health codes to no more than about 0.05% 
by mass. This amount is much lower than the 3.5% dissolved salts present in seawater 
and the 0.5% or so present in brackish water found underground in some regions. 
The removal of salts from seawater or brackish water to make the water usable is 
called desalination.
Water can be separated from dissolved salts by distillation because water is a 
volatile substance and the salts are nonvolatile. 
 (Section 1.3, “Separation of 
Mixtures”) The principle of distillation is simple enough, but carrying out the pro-
cess on a large scale presents many problems. As water is distilled from seawater, for 
example, the salts become more and more concentrated and eventually precipitate 
out. Distillation is also an energy-intensive process.
Seawater can also be desalinated using reverse osmosis. Recall that osmosis is 
the net movement of solvent molecules, but not solute molecules, through a semiper-
meable membran
