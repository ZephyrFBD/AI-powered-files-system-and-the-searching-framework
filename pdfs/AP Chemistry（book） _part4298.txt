(Section 9.7)
enthalpy A quantity defined by the relationship H = E + PV; the 
enthalpy change, ∆H, for a reaction that occurs at constant pressure 
is the heat evolved or absorbed in the reaction: ∆H = qp. (Section 5.3)
enthalpy of formation The enthalpy change that accompanies 
the formation of a substance from the most stable forms of its 
component elements. (Section 5.7)
enthalpy of reaction The enthalpy change associated with a 
chemical reaction. (Section 5.4)
entropy A measure of the tendency for energy to spread or 
disperse, thereby reducing its ability to accomplish work. In 
a general sense, it reflects the degree of randomness or disorder 
associated with the particles that carry the energy. (Section 19.2)
enzyme A protein molecule that acts to catalyze specific 
biochemical reactions. (Section 14.7)
equilibrium constant The numerical value of  
the equilibrium-constant expression for a system at equilibri
