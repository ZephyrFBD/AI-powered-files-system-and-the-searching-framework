ions have occurred
throughout geological history.
i.
Extinction rates become rapid during ecological stress.
ii. For example, during the Cretaceous extinction, which occurred approximately 65 million years
ago, about 50% of species, including almost all of the dinosaurs, became extinct.
The names and dates of the major extinctions will not be on the AP® Biology exam; however, be prepared to use data to
determine that extinction has occurred.
2. Adaptive radiation—the rapid development of new species from a common ancestor; may occur
after a significant genetic change in a member of a species, or after a new habitat becomes
available due to extinction of another (or many) species.
i.
Adaptive radiation causes an increase in speciation.
ii. Occurs after mass extinctions.
iii. Some significant adaptive radiations include the radiation of flowering plants after the
development of effective dormancy and dispersal strategies (e.g., pollen and seeds) and the
adaptive radiation of mammals afte
