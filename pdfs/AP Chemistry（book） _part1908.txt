gap Eg. In the semiconductor community, energies are given in electron volts 1eV2; 
1 eV = 1.602 * 10-19 J. Band gaps greater than âˆ¼3.5 eV are so large that the material is 
not a semiconductor; it is an insulator and does not conduct electricity.
Semiconductors can be divided into two classes: elemental semiconductors, which 
contain only one type of atom, and compound semiconductors, which contain two or 
more elements. The elemental semiconductors all come from group 4A. As we move 
down the periodic table, bond distances increase, which decreases orbital overlap. This 
decrease in overlap reduces the energy difference between the top of the valence band 
and the bottom of the conduction band. As a result, the band gap decreases on going 
from diamond 15.5 eV, an insulator2 to silicon 11.11 eV2 to germanium 10.67 eV2 to gray 
tin 10.08 eV2. In the heaviest group 4A element, lead, the band gap collapses altogether. 
As a result, lead has the structure and properties of a metal.
