 17.10  Ca1OH22 has a Ksp of 6.5 * 10-6. (a) If 0.370 g of Ca1OH22 
is added to 500 mL of water and the mixture is allowed 
to come to equilibrium, will the solution be saturated? 
 
(b) If 50 mL of the solution from part (a) is added to each 
of the beakers shown here, in which beakers, if any, will a 
precipitate form? In those cases where a precipitate forms, 
what is its identity? [Section 17.6]
 17.11  The graph below shows the solubility of a salt as a function 
of pH. Which of the following choices explain the shape 
of this graph? (a) None; this behavior is not possible.  
(b) A soluble salt reacts with acid to form a precipitate, 
and additional acid reacts with this product to dissolve it. 
(c) A soluble salt forms an insoluble hydroxide, then addi-
tional base reacts with this product to dissolve it. (d) The 
solubility of the salt increases with pH, then decreases
