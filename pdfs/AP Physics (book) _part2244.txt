Sources of Ferromagnetism
Microscopic examination reveals that a piece of iron is made up of tiny regions
known as domains, less than 1 mm in length or width. Each domain behaves like
a tiny magnet with a north and a south pole. In an unmagnetized piece of iron,
the domains are arranged randomly, Fig. 20–42a. The magnetic effects of the
domains cancel each other out, so this piece of iron is not a magnet. In a magnet,
the domains are preferentially aligned in one direction as shown in Fig. 20–42b
(downward in this case). A magnet can be made from an unmagnetized piece of
iron by placing it in a strong magnetic field. (You can make a needle magnetic,
for example, by stroking it with one pole of a strong magnet.) The magnetization
direction of domains may actually rotate slightly to be more nearly parallel to the
external field, and the borders of domains may move so domains with magnetic
orientation parallel to the external field grow
