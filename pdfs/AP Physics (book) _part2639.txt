(b) Drawing (greatly exaggerated)
showing wave fronts and rays to
explain highway mirages. Note how
sections of the wave fronts near the
ground are farther apart and so are
moving faster.
FIGURE 24–5 (a) Young’s double-
slit experiment. (b) If light consists
of particles, we would expect to see
two bright lines on the screen behind
the slits. (c) In fact, many lines are
observed. The slits and their
separation need to be very thin.

FIGURE 24–6 Plane waves 
(parallel flat wave fronts) fall on 
two slits. If light is a wave, light
passing through one of two slits
should interfere with light 
passing through the other slit.
†See pages 312 and 628.
To see how an interference pattern is produced on the screen, we make use
of Fig. 24–7. Waves of wavelength are shown entering the slits 
and 
which
are a distance d apart.
