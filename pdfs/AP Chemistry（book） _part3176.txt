 the blue color of Cu2+1aq2 ions 
fades and copper metal deposits on the zinc. At the same time, the zinc begins to dis-
solve. These transformations, shown in Figure 20.3, are summarized by the equation
 
Zn1s2 + Cu2+1aq2 ยก Zn2+1aq2 + Cu1s2 
[20.7]
Figure 20.4 shows a voltaic cell that uses the redox reaction given in Equation 20.7. 
Although the setup in Figure 20.4 is more complex than that in Figure 20.3, the reaction 
is the same in both cases. The significant difference is that in the voltaic cell the Zn metal 
and Cu2+1aq2 are not in direct contact with each other. Instead, Zn metal is in contact 
with Zn2+1aq2 in one compartment, and Cu metal is in contact with Cu2+1aq2 in the other 
compartment. Consequently, Cu2+1aq2 reduction can occur only by the flow of electrons 
through an external circuit, namely, a wire connecting the Zn and Cu strips. Electrons 
flowing through a wire and ions moving in solution both constitute an electrical current. 
This flow of electrical charge ca
