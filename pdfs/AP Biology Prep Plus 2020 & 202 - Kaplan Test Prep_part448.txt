he cell cycle and would,
therefore, fail to divide.

3. The diagram below illustrates the eﬀects of nondisjunction during
meiosis I and II.
What would happen if gamete 2 undergoes fertilization by
combining with a normal gamete from the same species?
Gamete 2 has an extra chromosome. If it undergoes
fertilization, there would be three copies of the longer
chromosome in the oﬀspring.
(A)
Gamete 2 has an extra chromosome. If it undergoes
fertilization, there would be two copies of the longer
chromosome in the oﬀspring.
(B)
Gamete 2 has one fewer chromosome. If it undergoes
fertilization, there would be one copy of the longer
chromosome in the oﬀspring.
(C)
Gamete 2 has one fewer chromosome. If it undergoes
fertilization, there would be two copies of the longer
chromosome in the oﬀspring.

4. Which of the following best characterizes the evolutionary
purpose of the chromosomal “crossing over” that occurs during
meiotic division?
The structural integrity of chromosomes is optimized b
