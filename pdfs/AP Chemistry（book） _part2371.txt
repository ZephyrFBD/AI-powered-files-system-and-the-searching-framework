ccur, neither reactants nor products can escape from the system.
t At equilibrium, a particular ratio of concentration terms equals a constant.
15.2 ∣ The Equilibrium Constant
A reaction in which reactants convert to products and products convert to reactants in 
the same reaction vessel naturally leads to an equilibrium, regardless of how complicated 
the reaction is and regardless of the nature of the kinetic processes for the forward and 
reverse reactions. Consider the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen:
 
N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ∆ 2 NH31g2 
[15.6]
This reaction is the basis for the Haber process, which is critical for the production of 
fertilizers and therefore critical to the world’s food supply. In the Haber process, N2 and 
H2 react at high pressure and temperature in the presence of a catalyst to form ammonia. 
In a closed system, however, the reaction does not lead to complete consumption of the 
N2 and H2. Rather, at some point the reaction appears to stop, with all t
