Organic Precursors
The organic molecules required for building cellular material and tissues must come from food. Carbohydrates or sugars
are the primary source of organic carbons in the animal body. During digestion, digestible carbohydrates are ultimately
broken down into glucose and used to provide energy through metabolic pathways. Complex carbohydrates, including
polysaccharides, can be broken down into glucose through biochemical modification; however, humans do not produce
the enzyme cellulase and lack the ability to derive glucose from the polysaccharide cellulose. In humans, these molecules
provide the fiber required for moving waste through the large intestine and a healthy colon. The intestinal flora in the human
gut are able to extract some nutrition from these plant fibers. The excess sugars in the body are converted into glycogen
and stored in the liver and muscles for later use. Glycogen stores are used to fuel prolonged exertions, such as long-distance
running, and t
