other, circle 5, is
 
XN Xn.
 
19. B. There are two possibilities for female 14, XNXN or XNXn. The color-blind mother, 7, is XnXn. The normal
father, 8, is XN Y . A cross between these two individuals can produce only one kind of daughter,
XN Xn (confirm this with a Punnett square). For practice, you should try to identify every female. Female 7 is color
blind (XNXn), females 2, 4, 5, 14, and 15 are carriers (XNXn), and females 9 and 11 are either
normal (XNXN) or carriers (XNXn). (There is not enough information to determine which genotype is correct.)
20. D. To be a calico, a cat must have two X chromosomes, one with the orange allele and one with the black allele.
Since a male cat has only one X chromosome, it normally can be only orange or black.
21. A. Since red-green color blindness is inherited as a sex-linked recessive allele, a color-blind male must be Xn Y .
Because he is a male,
he received the Y from his father. Therefore, he inherited the Xn from his mother.
