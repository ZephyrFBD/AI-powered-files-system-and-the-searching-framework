ency, the swing bounces around and reaches no great amplitude.
But if you push with a frequency equal to the natural frequency of the swing, the
amplitude increases greatly. At resonance, relatively little effort is required to
obtain and maintain a large amplitude.
The great tenor Enrico Caruso was said to be able to shatter a crystal goblet
by singing a note of just the right frequency at full voice. This is an example of
resonance, for the sound waves emitted by the voice act as a forced oscillation on
the glass. At resonance, the resulting oscillation of the goblet may be large enough
in amplitude that the glass exceeds its elastic limit and breaks (Fig. 11â€“19).
Since material objects are, in general, elastic, resonance is an important phe-
nomenon in a variety of situations. It is particularly important in construction,
although the effects are not always foreseen. For example, it has been reported
that a railway bridge collapsed because a nick in one of the wheels of a crossing
