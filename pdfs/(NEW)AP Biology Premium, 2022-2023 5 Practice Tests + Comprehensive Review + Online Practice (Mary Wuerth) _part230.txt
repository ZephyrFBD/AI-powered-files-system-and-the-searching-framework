dient to power the
production of ATP.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) The independent variable is temperature. The dependent variable is the cumulative number of bubbles of
carbon dioxide produced.
(b)
(c)
(d) The line for 10°C should be between the lines for 5°C and 20°C (higher than the line for 5°C and lower than
the line for 20°C). This is because the rate of cellular respiration at 10°C will be higher than the rate at the
colder temperature of 5°C and lower than the rate at the warmer temperature of 20°C.

Overview
Biological systems interact, exchange information about their environments, and respond to this information. Life
often depends on responding quickly to changing environmental conditions. This chapter reviews the basics of cell
