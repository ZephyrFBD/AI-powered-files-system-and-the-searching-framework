in which direction will the equilibrium shift when (a) Cl21g2 
is removed, (b) the temperature is decreased, (c) the volume 
of the reaction system is increased, (d) PCl31g2 is added?
By thinking of heat as a chemical reagent, we can use Le Châtelier’s 
principle to predict how an equilibrium mixture of reactants and 
products will respond to a change in temperature. For an endother-
mic reaction, the equilibrium constant K increases as the temperature 
rises and decreases as the temperature is lowered, while exothermic 
reactions respond in the opposite manner.  The underlying reason for 
this behavior can be understood by taking a closer look at the rela-
tionships among the equilibrium constant, the forward and reverse 
reaction rates, and their activation energies. 
To illustrate the underlying relationships consider an elemen-
tary reaction A ∆B. At equilibrium, the rates of the forward and 
reverse reactions are equal:
