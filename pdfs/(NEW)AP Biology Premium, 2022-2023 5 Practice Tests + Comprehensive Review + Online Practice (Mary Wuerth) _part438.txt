moths no longer had an advantage, and moths with darker wings were able to blend in with the darker tree
bark. This made darker moths more difficult for birds to find and eat. By the 1950s, over 90% of the moths in the
population had darker wings. As pollution controls were introduced during the 1960s, the light-colored lichen again
covered the trees. Lighter-colored moths once again had a survival advantage and become more prevalent over time.

TIP
A common mistake on the AP Biology exam is to describe evolution with Lamarckian statements, which describe individuals evolving in response
to their environment. Remember that populations evolve; individuals do not.
Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution by natural selection would explain this by saying that there were natural variations
in the moth population, with some moths having darker wings and some having lighter wings. The moths with
darker wings had a survival advantage during the Industrial Revo
