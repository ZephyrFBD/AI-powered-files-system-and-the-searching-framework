als are used about the 
central atom of each of these angles? (c) How many s bonds 
are in the molecule?
 9.63 (a) What is the difference between a localized p bond and a 
delocalized one? (b) How can you determine whether a mol-
ecule or ion will exhibit delocalized p bonding? (c) Is the p 
bond in NO2
- localized or delocalized?
 9.64  (a) Write a single Lewis structure for SO3, and determine the 
hybridization at the S atom. (b) Are there other equivalent 
Lewis structures for the molecule? (c) Would you expect SO3 
to exhibit delocalized p bonding?
