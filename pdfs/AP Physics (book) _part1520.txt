t” (or the “surroundings”). There are several cate-
gories of systems. A closed system is one for which no mass enters or leaves (but
energy may be exchanged with the environment). In an open system, mass may
enter or leave (as may energy). Many (idealized) systems we study in physics 
are closed systems. But many systems, including plants and animals, are open 
systems since they exchange materials (food, oxygen, waste products) with the
environment. A closed system is said to be isolated if no energy in any form 
(as well as no mass) passes across its boundaries; otherwise it is not isolated.
A perfectly isolated system is an ideal, but we often try to set up a system that
can be closely approximated as an isolated system (preferably one we can deal with
fairly easily). When different parts of an isolated system are at different tempera-
tures, heat will flow (energy is transferred) from the part at higher temperature to
the part at lower temperature—that is, within the system—until
