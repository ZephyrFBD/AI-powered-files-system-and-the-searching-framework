LIGHT-INDEPENDENT REACTIONS—THE CALVIN
CYCLE
The Calvin cycle is the main business of the light-independent reactions.
It is a cyclical process that produces the 3-carbon sugar PGAL
(phosphoglyceraldehyde). Carbon enters the stomates of a leaf in the
form of CO2 and becomes fixed or incorporated into PGAL.
Here are the important aspects of the Calvin cycle, as shown in Figure
7.8.
The process that occurs during the Calvin cycle is carbon fixation.
It is a reduction reaction since carbon is gaining protons and
electrons.
CO2 enters the Calvin cycle and becomes attached to a 5-carbon
sugar, ribulose biphosphate (RuBP), forming a 6-carbon
molecule. The 6-carbon molecule is unstable and immediately
breaks down into two 3-carbon molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate
(3-PGA G3P). The enzyme that catalyzes this first step is ribulose
biphosphate carboxylase (rubisco).
The Calvin cycle does not directly depend
