about the rate of the leak.
12. A bowling ball hangs from a 1.0-m-long cord, Fig. 7–30:
(i) A 200-gram putty ball moving 
hits the bowling
ball and sticks to it, causing the bowling ball to swing up;
(ii) a 200-gram rubber ball moving 
hits the bowling
ball and bounces straight back at nearly
causing the
bowling ball to swing up. Describe what happens.
(a) The bowling ball swings up by the same amount in
both (i) and (ii).
(b) The ball swings up farther in (i) than in (ii).
(c) The ball swings up farther in (ii) than in (i).
(d) Not enough information is given; we need the contact
time between the rubber ball and the bowling ball.
