ant diversity
than do ecosystems further south or north. One of several
explanations offered to account for this observation is the
energy-equivalence modelâ€”as free energy increases,
population size increases. As population size increases,
mutations increase. One bit of evidence for the energy-
equivalence model is the correlation of family-level
diversity with actual evapotranspiration, the sum of water
transferred by both transpiration and evaporation of
surface water. This property is reported in mm of water per
square meter of surface area.
B. Explain the relationship between free energy exchange
and latitude that is the basis of the energy-equivalence
model.
Shared ancestry is indicated by taxonomic classification in
which a family of organisms contains many genera, and
within each genus there are many species. A survey of tree
flora (Latham and Ricklefs, Oikos, 67, 1993) at
comparable latitudes in a temperate eastern Asia forest
ecosystem (729 species in 177 genera and 67 familie
