 For q we have:
Analyze We first recognize that freezing is an exothermic process, 
which means heat is transferred from the system to the surround-
ings and q 6 0. Because freezing is the reverse of melting, the 
enthalpy change that accompanies the freezing of 1 mol of Hg is 
- ∆Hfusion = -2.29 kJ>mol.
Plan We can use - ∆Hfusion and the atomic weight of Hg to calcu-
late q for freezing 50.0 g of Hg. Then we use this value of q as qrev in 
Equation 19.2 to determine ∆S for the system.
Check The entropy change is negative because our qrev value is neg-
ative, which it must be because heat flows out of the system in this 
exothermic process.
Comment This procedure can be used to calculate ∆S for other iso-
thermal phase changes, such as the vaporization of a liquid at its 
boiling point.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Do all exothermic phase changes have a negative value for 
the entropy change of the system? (a) Yes, because the heat 
transferred from the system has a negative sign. (b) Yes,
