tern flowers observed – expected = 1,303 – 1,098
= 205 and for the eastern side observed – expected = 892 – 1,098 = –206. When we square each of them, it is
42,025 and 42,436. Divide each by the expected = 42,025/1,098 and 42, 436/1,098 = 38.27 and 38.64. Those
get added together = 76.91 for the chi-squared value.
d. Using your chi-squared analysis data, explain if you can reject the null hypothesis that flowers do not prefer
the western side. (1 point)
Yes, the null hypothesis can be rejected. The flowers appear to grow significantly more on the Western side.
Question 3
a. Describe how a mutation in DNA can lead to a protein that no longer functions correctly.
Mutations in DNA are a mistake in the recipe used to make a protein. When the DNA gets expressed, it gets turned
into an RNA during transcription. This causes an error in the mRNA. Then, the mRNA gets translated and the codons
get read and amino acids get added to build the protein. If there was a mistake in the RNA, then the wr
