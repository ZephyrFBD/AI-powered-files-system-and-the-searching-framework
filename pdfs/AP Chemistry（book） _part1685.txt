Nickel carbonyl, Ni1CO24, is one of the most toxic sub-
stances known. The present maximum allowable concen-
tration in laboratory air during an 8-hr workday is 1 ppb 
(parts per billion) by volume, which means that there is 
one mole of Ni1CO24 for every 109 moles of gas. Assume 
24 Â°C and 1.00 atm pressure. What mass of Ni1CO24 is al-
lowable in a laboratory room that is 12 ft * 20 ft *  9 ft?
 10.104 When a large evacuated flask is filled with argon gas, its mass 
increases by 3.224 g. When the same flask is again evacuated 
and then filled with a gas of unknown molar mass, the mass 
increase is 8.102 g. (a) Based on the molar mass of argon, 
estimate the molar mass of the unknown gas. (b) What as-
sumptions did you make in arriving at your answer?
