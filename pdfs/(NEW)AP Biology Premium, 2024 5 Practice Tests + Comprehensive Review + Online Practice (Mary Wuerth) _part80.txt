y action describes water’s
ability to climb up narrow tubes. While ice may cool limited areas, the density of ice does not explain why
coastal areas have more stable climates than inland areas, so choice (D) is incorrect.
7. (A) Surface tension describes the attraction of molecules to each other on the surface of a liquid. Since water
has strong hydrogen bonds, it has a higher surface tension that is sufficient enough to support the mass of very
lightweight insects on its surface. Choice (B) is incorrect because specific heat is not involved in supporting the
mass of an insect on the surface of water. Choice (C) is incorrect because capillary action describes water’s
ability to climb up narrow tubes. While the density of ice is less than the density of liquid water, this does not
explain why lightweight insects can walk on the surface of water, so choice (D) is incorrect.
8. (D) Ice has a lower density than that of liquid water, which allows ice floes to float on the ocean surface.
