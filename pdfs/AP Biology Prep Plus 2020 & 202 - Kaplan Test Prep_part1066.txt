Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Harmful algal blooms can be controlled using chemical and biological measures. Chemical
treatment is used to inhibit algal growth or kill algae but may impact the pH of the water.
Prevention
OR
Mechanical (aeration, circulate, surface skimming,
etc.)
OR
Chemical
OR
Biological
Prevention measures reduce the amount of nitrogen
and phosphorus entering the bay.
OR
Mechanical methods reduce the competitive
advantage of algal blooms by limiting the
accessibility of nutrients at the surface.
OR
Chemical methods could either bind to excess
nutrients to remove them from the water or inhibit
algae growth/kill algae.
OR
Biological methods, such as the introduction of
wetland plants, will compete for nutrients to limit
algal growth.
