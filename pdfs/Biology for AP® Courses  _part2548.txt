 archaea
that are adapted to grow in extreme
environments.
c.
Earth’s early environment was full of extreme
places with little oxygen in the atmosphere, no
ozone to shield Earth’s surface from mutagenic
radiation, less geologic upheaval and volcanic
activity. Extremophiles are bacteria and archaea
that are adapted to grow in extreme
environments.
d.
For the first two billion years of Earth’s
existence, the atmosphere had no molecular
oxygen.

a.
It has a cell wall enclosing cell membrane,
cytoplasm, ribosomes and nucleoid region with
genetic material. It may have a protective
capsule, flagellum, pili and plasmids.
b.
It has a cell wall enclosing cell membrane,
cytoplasm, ribosomes and nucleus containing
genetic material. It may have a protective
capsule, flagellum, pili and plasmids.
c.
It has a cell wall enclosing nuclear membrane,
