harmless.  
Based on the trend over the past few years of the study, the fungus has become extinct.  
(B) Infected individuals gradually died out, and genetically resistant individuals became more common.  
The frog population recovered because of the increased frequency of resistant individuals. 
(C) The patterns of the curves on the graph indicate a sudden increase in the severity of the fungal infection. 
A large proportion of the frog population died because the individuals could not evolve fast enough.  
 
(D) The size of the frog population decreased sharply upon initial contact with the fungus. The fungus 
eventually became symbiotic with individual frogs, and the frog population began to recover.

26. The Trp operon is a coordinately regulated group of genes (trpAâ€“trpE) that are required for tryptophan 
biosynthesis in E. coli. Based on the figure above, which of
