24–1 Waves vs. Particles;
Huygens’ Principle and Diffraction
The Dutch scientist Christian Huygens (1629–1695), a contemporary of Newton,
proposed a wave theory of light that had much merit. Still useful today is a
technique Huygens developed for predicting the future position of a wave front
when an earlier position is known. By a wave front, we mean all the points along
a two- or three-dimensional wave that form a wave crest—what we simply call a
“wave” as seen on the ocean. Wave fronts are perpendicular to rays as discussed
in Chapter 11 (Fig. 11–35). Huygens’ principle can be stated as follows: Every
point on a wave front can be considered as a source of tiny wavelets that spread
out in the forward direction at the speed of the wave itself. The new wave front is
the envelope of all the wavelets—that is, the tangent to all of them.
As an example of the use of Huygens’ principle, consider t
