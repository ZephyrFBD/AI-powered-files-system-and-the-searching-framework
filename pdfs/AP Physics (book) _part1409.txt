 modulus developed in Chapter 9. To calculate the internal
stress in a beam, we can think of this process as occurring in two steps: (1) the
beam tries to expand (or contract) by an amount 
given by Eq. 13–1; (2) the
solid in contact with the beam exerts a force to compress (or expand) it, keeping
it at its original length. The force F required is given by Eq. 9–4:
where E is Young’s modulus for the material. To calculate the internal stress,
we then set 
in Eq. 13–1a equal to 
in the equation above and find
Hence, the stress is
For example, if 10-m-long concrete slabs are placed touching each other in a new
park you are designing, a 30°C increase in temperature would produce a stress
That
stress would exceed the shear strength of concrete (Table 9–2), no doubt causing
fracture and cracks. This is why soft spacers (or expansion joints) are placed between
slabs on sidewalks and highways.
