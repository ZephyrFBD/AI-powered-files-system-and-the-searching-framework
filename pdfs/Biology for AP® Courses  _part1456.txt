the passage, which of the following events are believed to have occurred after humans diverged from
their common ancestor with chimpanzees?
a.
Paracentric inversions occurred at several chromosomes, including human chromosome 18.
b.
Two separate chromosomes underwent a pericentric inversion, then fused to form chromosome 2 in humans.
c.
19, 000 nucleotide bases were duplicated, inverted, and reinserted at human chromosome 18.
d.
The ROCK1 and USP14 genes were duplicated in early humans, which increased expression of these genes.
Translocations
A translocation occurs when a segment of a chromosome dissociates and reattaches to a different, nonhomologous
chromosome. Translocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of genes are altered
with respect to regulatory sequences. Reciprocal translocations result from the exchange of chromosome segments between
two nonhomologous chromosomes such that there is no gain or loss of genetic information (Figure 13
