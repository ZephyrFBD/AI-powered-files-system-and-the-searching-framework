ll sound. We would never mistake a piano
for a flute. This is what is meant by the quality of a sound. For musical instruments,
the terms timbre and tone color are also used.
Just as loudness and pitch can be related to physically measurable quantities,
so too can quality. The quality of a sound depends on the presence of overtones—
their number and their relative amplitudes. Generally, when a note is played on a
musical instrument, the fundamental as well as overtones are present simultaneously.
Figure 12–14 illustrates how the principle of superposition (Section 11–11) applies
to three wave forms, in this case the fundamental and first two overtones (with
particular amplitudes): they add together at each point to give a composite waveform.

By “waveform” we mean the shape of the wave in space at a given moment. Nor-
mally, more than two overtones are present. [Any complex wave can be analyzed
into a superposition of sinusoidal waves of appropriate amplitudes, wavelengths,
and freque
