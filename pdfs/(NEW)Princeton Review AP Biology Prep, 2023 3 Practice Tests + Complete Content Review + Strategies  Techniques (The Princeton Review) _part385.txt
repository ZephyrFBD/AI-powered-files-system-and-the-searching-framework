r. These are called analogous structures. Another classic
example of an analogous structure is the eye. Though scallops, insects, and humans all have eyes, these three
different types of eyes are thought to have evolved entirely independently of one another. They are therefore
analogous structures.
Molecular Biology: Perhaps the most compelling proof of all is the similarity at the molecular level. Today,
scientists can examine nucleo​tide and amino acid sequences of different organisms. From these analyses, we’ve
discovered that organisms that are closely related have a greater proportion of sequences in common than
distantly related species. For example, humans don’t look much like chimpanzees. However, by some estimates,
as much as 99 percent of our genetic code is identical to that of a chimp. All eukaryotes have membrane-bound
organelles, linear chromosomes, and genes that contain introns.
Continuing Evolution: There is evidence that evolution is constantly occurring. We can see c
