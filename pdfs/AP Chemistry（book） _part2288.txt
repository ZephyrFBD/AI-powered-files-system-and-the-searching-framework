iving organisms, 
found in many compounds vital to life, including proteins, nucleic 
acids, vitamins, and hormones. Nitrogen is continually cycling 
through the biosphere in various forms, as shown in Figure 14.28. 
For example, certain microorganisms convert the nitrogen in animal 
waste and dead plants and animals into N21g2, which then returns to 
the atmosphere. For the food chain to be sustained, there must be a 
means of converting atmospheric N21g2 into a form plants can use. 
For this reason, if a chemist were asked to name the most important 
chemical reaction in the world, she might easily say nitrogen fixation, 
the process by which atmospheric N21g2 is converted into compounds 
suitable for plant use. Some fixed nitrogen results from the action of 
lightning on the atmosphere, and some is produced industrially us-
ing a process we will discuss in Chapter 15. About 60% of fixed nitro-
gen, however, is a consequence of the action of the remarkable and 
complex enzyme nitroge
