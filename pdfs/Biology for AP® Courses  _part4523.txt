isms that invest in long-term parental care
have few offspring. Having a limited number of
offspring means there is greater risk of rapid
increase in population.
57. A honey bee colony contains one queen, hundreds of
drones, and many thousands of worker bees. The queen
produces eggs, the drones produce sperm, and the workers
are sterile. Explain how the reproductive strategy of honey
bees benefits the survival of the species. (credit: Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)
a.
The fertile queen and drones produce many
offspring while sterile worker bees do not
benefit the survival of the species.
b.
Worker bees produce many offspring while the
sterile queen and drones do not benefit the
survival of the species.
c.
The sterile queen and drones use the energy
taken in by them for their own growth, growth
and maintenance of the hive, and protection and
nurturing of offspring.
d.
Sterile worker bees use the energy taken in by
them for their own growth, growth and
maintenan
