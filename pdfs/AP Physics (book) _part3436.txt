 small nucleus) that strikes
nucleus X, producing nucleus Y and particle b (typically, p, n,
). We define
the reaction energy, or Q-value, in terms of the masses involved, as
(31;2a)
For a 
ray,
If energy is released by the reaction,
If energy is
required,
Because energy is conserved, Q has to be equal to the change in kinetic
energy (final minus initial):
(31;2b)
If X is a target nucleus at rest (or nearly so) struck by incoming particle a, then
For 
the reaction is said to be exothermic or exoergic; energy is
released in the reaction, so the total kinetic energy is greater after the reaction
than before. If Q is negative, the reaction is said to be endothermic or endoergic:
an energy input is required to make the reaction happen. The energy input comes
from the kinetic energy of the initial colliding particles (a and X).
A slow-neutron reaction. The nuclear reaction
is observed to occur even when very slow-moving neutrons (mass 
)
strike boron atoms at rest. For a particular reaction
