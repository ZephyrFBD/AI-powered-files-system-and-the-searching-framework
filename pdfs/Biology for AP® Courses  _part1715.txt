41. A tRNA is chemically modified so that the amino acid
bound is different than the one specified by its anticodon.
Which codon in the mRNA would the tRNA recognize:
the one specified by its anticodon or the one that matches
the modified amino acid it carries?
a.
The anticodon will match the codon in mRNA.
b.
The anticodon will match with the modified
amino acid it carries.
c.
The anticodon will lose the specificity for the
tRNA molecule.
d.
The enzyme amino acyl tRNA synthetase would
lose control over the amino acid.
