or,
where 
is given off and the gas
cools to become liquid. The liquid
passes from a high-pressure region,
via a valve, to low-pressure tubes on
the inside walls of the refrigerator;
the liquid evaporates at this lower
pressure and thus absorbs heat 
from the inside of the refrigerator.
The fluid returns to the compressor,
where the cycle begins again.

A perfect refrigerator—one in which no work is required to take heat from the
low-temperature region to the high-temperature region—is not possible. This is
the Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics, already mentioned
in Section 15–4: it can be stated formally as
no device is possible whose sole effect is to transfer heat from one system at a
temperature 
into a second system at a higher temperature 
To make heat flow from a low-temperature object (or system) to one at a higher
temperature, work must be done. Thus, there can be no perfect refrigerator.
