Description (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
During a long period of exercise, cells consume more energy. To meet that
energy need, cells undergo aerobic respiration, which produces a higher ATP
yield than anaerobic respiration, approximately 36 molecules of ATP per
molecule of glucose, compared to only 2 ATP per glucose for anaerobic.
(b) Based on the figure, explainÂ the four sources of ATP during muscle
metabolism with respect to time. (1 point)
Explanation (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Muscles obtain ATP, which is required for muscle metabolism, from free ATP,
phosphocreatine, anaerobic respiration, and aerobic respiration. First, a small
Cells consume more energy during long periods of exercise, and aerobic respiration produces
more ATP than anaerobic respiration to meet that energy n
