In general, electron domains for multiple bonds exert a greater repulsive force on adjacent 
electron domains than do electron domains for single bonds.

Give It Some Thought

The bond angles in this ion are 120°. Is this observation consistent with the 
preceding discussion of the effect of multiple bonds on bond angles?
Molecules with Expanded Valence Shells
Atoms from period 3 and beyond may be surrounded by more than four electron pairs. 
 (Section 8.7) Molecules with five or six electron domains around the central atom 
have molecular geometries based on either a trigonal-bipyramidal (five domains) or 
 
octahedral (six domains) electron-domain geometry (Table 9.3).
