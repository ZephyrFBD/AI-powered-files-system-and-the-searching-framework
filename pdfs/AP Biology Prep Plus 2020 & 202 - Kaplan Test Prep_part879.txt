ies A is the most distantly related
species because the number of differences in nucleotides between Species A and
C, as well as between Species A and D, is the largest on the table. Thus, the
bottom branch should be labeled A. Species B is equally different from Species
A, C, and D, so it belongs on the top branch of the tree.
(d) Using the data in the phylogenetic tree you created in part (b) and the
information in Table 1, identify the nucleotide position that corresponds
with the branch point leading to Species C. Justify your answer. (2 points)
The number of diﬀerences in nucleotides between Species C and D is the smallest (2), so Species
C and D are the most closely related species (Note: C and D can be interchanged on the tree due
to rotation about the branch point)
The number of diﬀerences in nucleotides between Species A and C and between Species A and
D are the largest (4), so Species A is most distantly related to Species C and D
