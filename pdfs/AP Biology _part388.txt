(B) DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to an existing strand
of nucleotides. RNA primer binds to the DNA, and DNA
polymerase attaches nucleotides to the RNA primer. (IST-1)
(C) If guanine makes up 28% of the DNA, then there must be an
equal amount of cytosine (28%), for a total of 56%. That leaves 44%
for adenine and thymine. Dividing 44 by 2 = 22%, which is the
percentage of thymine in the DNA. (SP 5)
(B) The sequence consists of codons. Read them off the chart
provided to determine the amino acid for that codon. GUA = Val,
CUA = Leu, etc. None of the other choices fit the correct pattern.

(C) First, establish if there is any change in the amino acids due to
the mutation in the codon. AGU codes for the amino acid ser

acid gly (glycine), as does the mutated version, GGG. Therefore,
there is no change in the amino a
