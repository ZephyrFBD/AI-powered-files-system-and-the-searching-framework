s also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the
energy of sunlight. The production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis is called oxidative phosphorylation because
of the involvement of oxygen in the process.
Figure 7.5 In eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation takes place in mitochondria. In prokaryotes, this process takes
place in the plasma membrane. (Credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)

Think About It
Explain why it is more metabolically efficient for cells to extract energy from ATP rather than from the bonds of
carbohydrates directly.
Mitochondrial Disease Physician
What happens when the critical reactions of cellular respiration do not proceed correctly? Mitochondrial
diseases are genetic disorders of metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders can arise from mutations in nuclear
or mitochondrial DNA, and they result in the production of less energy than is normal in body cells. In type 2
diabetes,
