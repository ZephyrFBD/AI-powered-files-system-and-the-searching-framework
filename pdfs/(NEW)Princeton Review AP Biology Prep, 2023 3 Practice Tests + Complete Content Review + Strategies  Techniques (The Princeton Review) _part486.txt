s and results that are so
different that they must tell a different story altogether?
Chi-square tests are one way to make this decision. They start with a null hypothesis (H0), which represents a set
numerical outcome that you want to compare your data with. The chi-square test will determine if your actual data is
close to the null hypothesis outcome and could have occurred due to a fluke (i.e., rolling a six 24 times) or if it is so
different that it is probably not a fluke (i.e., 40 rolled sixes) and the null hypothesis outcome must not correctly
describe what is occurring. In the dice case, rolling a six 40 times would cause the null hypothesis of expecting a
1:1:1:1:1:1 to be rejected and the die can be considered to be weighted. In the calculations, expected results if the
null hypothesis were true are compared to the actual values, and an Ï‡2 value is calculated. This value is compared to
a critical value, and a decision is made to reject or accept the null hypothesis.
