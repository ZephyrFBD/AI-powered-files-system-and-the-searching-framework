6. For an arsenic donor atom in a doped silicon semiconduc-
tor, assume that the “extra” electron moves in a Bohr orbit
about the arsenic ion. For this electron in the ground state,
take into account the dielectric constant 
of the 
Si lattice (which represents the weakening of the Coulomb
force due to all the other atoms or ions in the lattice), and
estimate (a) the binding energy, and (b) the orbit radius
for this extra electron. [Hint: Substitute 
in
Coulomb’s law; see Section 17–8 and also 27–12.]
