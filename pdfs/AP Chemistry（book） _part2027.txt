d the negative end 
oriented toward Na+ ions. These ion–dipole attractions are strong enough to pull the 
surface ions away from the solid, thus overcoming the solute–solute interactions. For 
the solid to dissolve, some solvent–solvent interactions must also be overcome to create 
room for the ions to “fit” among all the water molecules.
Once separated from the solid, the Na+ and Cl- ions are surrounded by water mole-
cules. Interactions such as this between solute and solvent molecules are known as sol-
vation. When the solvent is water, the interactions are referred to as hydration.

Give It Some Thought
Why doesn’t NaCl dissolve in nonpolar solvents such as hexane, C6H14?
