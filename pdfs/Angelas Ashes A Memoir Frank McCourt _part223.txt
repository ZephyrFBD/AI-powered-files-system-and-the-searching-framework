nd take off my shoes and 
 
 stockings but when I go into the class the master wants to know where 
 
 my shoes are. He knows I’m not one of the barefoot boys and he makes 
 
 me go back to the yard, bring in the shoes and put them on.Then he 
 
 says to the class,There is sneering here.There is jeering at the misfortunes 
 
 of others. Is there anyone in this class that thinks he’s perfect? 
 
 Raise your hands. 
 
 There are no hands. 
 
 Is there anyone in this class that comes from a rich family with 
 
 money galore to spend on shoes? Raise your hands. 
 
 There are no hands.

 He says,There are boys here who have to mend their shoes whatever 
 
 way they can.There are boys in this class with no shoes at all. It’s not their 
 
 fault and it’s no shame. Our Lord had no shoes. He died shoeless. Do you 
 
 see Him hanging on the cross sporting shoes? Do you, boys? 
 
 No, sir. 
 
 What is it you don’t see Our Lord doing? 
 
 Hanging on the cross and sporting shoes, sir.
