 appears greenish yellow (
is strongest)
when white light reflects from it. What minimum thickness 
of coating 
do you think is used on such a glass
lens  
, and why?
48. (II) A thin film of oil 
with varying thickness
floats on water 
When it is illuminated from
above by white light, the reflected colors are as shown in
Fig. 24–60. In air, the wavelength of yellow light is 580 nm.
(a) Why are there no reflected colors at point A? (b) What
is the oil’s thickness 
at point B?

49. (II) How many uncoated thin lenses in an optical instrument
would reduce the amount of light passing through the instru-
ment to 50% or less? (Assume the same transmission percent
at each of the two surfaces—see page 697.)
50. (II) A total of 35 bright and 35 dark Newton’s rings (not
counting the dark spot at the center) are observed when
560-nm light falls normally on a planoconvex lens resting
on a flat glass surface (Fig. 2
