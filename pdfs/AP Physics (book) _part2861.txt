r than it actually is.
(c) makes the object appear farther than it actually is.
(d) causes additional light rays to be emitted by the
object.
8. It would be impossible to build a microscope that could
use visible light to see the molecular structure of a crystal
because.
(a) lenses with enough magnification cannot be made.
(b) lenses cannot be ground with fine enough precision.
(c) lenses cannot be placed in the correct place with
enough precision.
(d) diffraction limits the resolving power to about the size
of the wavelength of the light used.
(e) More than one of the above is correct.
9. Why aren’t white-light microscopes made with a magnifi-
cation of 
(a) Lenses can’t be made large enough.
(b) Lenses can’t be made small enough.
(c) Lenses can’t be made with short enough focal lengths.
(d) Lenses can’t be made with long enough focal lengths.
(e) Diffraction limits useful magnification to several times
less than this.
10. The resolving power of a microscope is greatest when the
