65. In an experiment on transport in plants, seedlings are
exposed to radiolabeled minerals. In a second experiment,
plants are provided with CO2 that is labeled with 14C. At
the end of each experiment, tissue slices are analyzed for
the presence of radiolabeled minerals and radioactive
sucrose. Which plant tissue would show the presence of
labeled minerals and which would show the presence of
radioactive sucrose?
a.
Phloem tissue would show the presence of
labeled minerals and xylem tissue would show
the presence of radioactive sucrose.
b.
Xylem tissue would show the presence of
labeled minerals and phloem tissue would show
the presence of radioactive sucrose.
c.
Parenchyma would show the presence of labeled
minerals and sclerenchyma would show the
presence of radioactive sucrose.
d.
Sclerenchyma
