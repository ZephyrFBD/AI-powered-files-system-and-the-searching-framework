ed offspring and low-plated 
offspring in an approximate 3:1 ratio. Which of 
the following conclusions is best supported by the 
results of the breeding experiments? 
(A) Phenotypic variation in the F2 generation 
suggests that armor morphology is 
controlled by many alleles of a single gene. 
(B) The completely-plated phenotype is 
controlled by a dominant allele of a  
single gene. 
(C) Armor loss is an acquired characteristic that 
is affected by one or more environmental 
factors. 
(D) Patterns of armor plating in stickleback 
populations are regulated by sex-specific 
signals. 
 
18. Prior to 1960, Lake Washington was highly 
polluted and underwater visibility was limited to 
one or two meters. In the late 1960s, a large 
cleanup effort reduced pollution, resulting in 
visibility that increased to six to seven meters by 
1976. Which of the following best explains how 
the change in underwater visibility affected armor 
plating in Lake Washington sticklebacks between 
1957 and 197
