Question 5 
 
 
Phototropism in plants is a response in which a plant shoot grows toward a light source. The results of  
five different experimental treatments from classic investigations of phototropism are shown above. 
(a) Give support for the claim that the cells located in the tip of the plant shoot detect the light by 
comparing the results from treatment group I with the results from treatment group II and 
treatment group III. 
Support (2 points maximum) 
• 
In treatment II the tip is removed and the plant no longer bends toward li
