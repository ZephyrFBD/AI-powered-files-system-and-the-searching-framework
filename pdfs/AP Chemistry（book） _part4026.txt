8.49 Statement (b) is most true. Keep in mind that when it is 
necessary to place more than an octet of electrons around an 
atom in order to minimize formal charge, there may not be a 
“best” Lewis structure. 8.51 Formal charges are shown on the

extremely bulky, causing the nonbonding electron pair to occupy 
an axial position.) 9.5 (a) Zero. Moving from left to right along the 
x-axis of the plot, the distance between the Cl atoms increases. At 
very large separation, the potential energy of interaction approaches 
zero. (b) The Cl—Cl bond distance is approximately 2.0 Å. The Cl—Cl 
bond energy is approximately 240 kJ/mol. (c) Weaker. Under extreme 
pressure, the Cl—Cl bond gets shorter. The potential energy of the 
atom pair increases and the bond gets weaker. 9.11 (a) i, Two s atomic 
orbitals; ii, two p atomic orbitals overlapping end to end; iii, t
