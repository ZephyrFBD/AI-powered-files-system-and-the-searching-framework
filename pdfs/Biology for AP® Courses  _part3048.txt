nations, buffer ions and chemicals that would
otherwise harm neurons, and provide myelin sheaths around axons. Scientists have recently discovered that they also play
a role in responding to nerve activity and modulating communication between nerve cells.
Types of Glia
There are several different types of glia with different functions, two of which are shown in Figure 26.7. Astrocytes, shown
in Figure 26.8a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the CNS. They provide nutrients and other substances
to neurons, regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid, and provide structural support
for synapses. Astrocytes also form the blood-brain barrierâ€”a structure that blocks entrance of toxic substances into the
brain. Astrocytes, in particular, have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to
nerve activity, transmit calcium waves between astrocytes, and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses. Satellite glia
