(a) Can you use these data to explain why gold does not tar-
nish in the air? (b) Suggest several substances that should 
be strong enough oxidizing agents to oxidize gold metal. 
 
(c) Miners obtain gold by soaking gold-containing ores 
in an aqueous solution of sodium cyanide. A very soluble 
complex ion of gold forms in the aqueous solution because 
of the redox reaction
4 Au1s2 + 8 NaCN1aq2 + 2 H2O1l2 + O21g2
 
¡ 4 Na3Au1CN2241aq2 + 4 NaOH1aq2
What is being oxidized, and what is being reduced in this 
reaction? (d) Gold miners then react the basic aqueous 
product solution from part (c) with Zn dust to get gold 
metal. Write a balanced redox reaction for this process. 
What is being oxidized, and what is being reduced?
 20.101  A voltaic cell is constructed from an Ni2+1aq2 - Ni1s2 
half-cell and an Ag+1aq2 - Ag1s2 half-cell. The initial 
concentration of Ni2+1aq2 in the Ni2+ - Ni half-cell is 
3Ni2+4 = 0.0100 M. The initial cell voltage is
