stabilization of p electrons by delocalization
If you draw one Lewis structure for benzene, you draw a ring that contains three CC dou-
ble bonds and three single CC bonds. 
 (Section 8.6) You might therefore expect ben-
zene to resemble the alkenes and to be highly reactive. Benzene and the other aromatic 
hydrocarbons, however, are much more stable than alkenes because the p electrons are 
delocalized in the p orbitals. 
 (Section 9.6)
We can estimate the stabilization of the p electrons in benzene by comparing the 
energy released upon forming cyclohexane by adding hydrogen to benzene, to cyclohex-
ene (one double bond), and to 1,4-cyclohexadiene (two double bonds):
Benzene
Anthracene
Naphthalene
Toluene
(Methylbenzene)
CH3
Pyrene
