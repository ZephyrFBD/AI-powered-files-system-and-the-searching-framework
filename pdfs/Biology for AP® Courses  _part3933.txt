intact antigens that have not been processed. Although T and B
cells both react with molecules that are termed “antigens,” these lymphocytes actually respond to very different types of
molecules. B cells must be able to bind intact antigens because they secrete antibodies that must recognize the pathogen
directly, rather than digested remnants of the pathogen. Bacterial carbohydrate and lipid molecules can activate B cells
independently from the T cells.
Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes
CTLs, a subclass of T cells, function to clear infections directly. The cell-mediated part of the adaptive immune system
consists of CTLs that attack and destroy infected cells. CTLs are particularly important in protecting against viral
infections; this is because viruses replicate within cells where they are shielded from extracellular contact with circulating
antibodies. When APCs phagocytize pathogens and present MHC I-embedded antigens to naïve CD8+ T cells that express
complementary TCRs, the CD8+ T cells
