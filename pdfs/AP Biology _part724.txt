pancreas and raises
blood sugar by breaking down glycogen that is stored in the liver.
(A) Glucagon raises blood sugar levels, as explained in the answer to
Question 5.
(B) The smaller cell is more efficient for two reasons. First, the ratio
of the size of the nucleus in the smaller cell compared to the size of
the cytoplasm is greater than that of the larger cell. Second, there is
more surface area of membrane compared to the volume of the
cytoplasm in the smaller cell. Choice A is incorrect because that
statement is not true about both cells. Choice C is incorrect because
it is the opposite of the correct answer. Choice D is incorrect
because the ratio of the size of the nucleus to the volume of the
cytoplasm in the larger cell is much smaller than that of the smaller
cell.
(C) Insulin is pumped out of the pancreas to bring glucose blood
levels back down to the homeostatic set point. Glycogen is the large
molecule in which glucose is packed for storage. Glucagon is the
hormone respon
