 In an experiment, the efficiency of oxygen 
exchange across the plasma membrane is being 
assessed in four artificial red blood cells. The 
table above lists some properties of those artificial 
cells. Other conditions being equal, which 
artificial cell is predicted to be the most efficient 
in exchanging oxygen with the environment by 
diffusion? 
(A) The cuboidal cell  
(B) The tetrahedral cell 
(C) The cylindrical cell 
(D) The spherical cell
