productive isolation, meaning that
one group of genes becomes isolated from another to begin a separate
evolutionary history. Once separated, the two isolated populations may
begin to diverge genetically under the pressure of different selective forces
in different environments. If enough time elapses and differing selective
forces are sufficiently great, the two populations may become so different
that, even if they were brought back together, interbreeding would not
naturally occur. At that point, speciation is said to have taken place.
Anything that fragments a population and isolates small groups of
individuals may cause speciation. The following describes different modes
of speciation due to different modes of isolation, and Figure 11.3 shows
diagrams of allopatric and sympatric speciation.

Speciation may occur when two populations become reproductively isolated from each
other.
