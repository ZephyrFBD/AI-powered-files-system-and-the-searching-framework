l eggs stops. At puberty, oogenesis begins again, producing one secondary oocyte each month. At
the end of meiosis I, ovulation occurs with the eruption of a secondary oocyte from the follicle. If the secondary
oocyte is penetrated by a sperm (fertilization), meiosis II ensues.
2. C. Ovulation from a follicle is induced by a surge in LH. 3. B. Progesterone (and estrogen) stimulate the
thickening of the endometrium, the inside lining of the uterus.
4. B. Progesterone (and estrogen) are secreted by the follicle. After ovulation, progesterone and estrogen are secreted
by the corpus luteum. (The follicle becomes the corpus luteum after ovulation.)
5. C. LH stimulates interstitial cells in the testes to produce testosterone and other androgens.
6. D. The unequal distribution of morphogens across the embryo generates a morphogen gradient that establishes the
anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral axes of the embryo. The strength of the morphogens in a particular cell signals
to the cell where
