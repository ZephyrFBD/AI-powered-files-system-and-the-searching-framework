pecies) to produce oﬀspring with a
full diploid set of chromosomes. The overarching purpose of meiosis is to
facilitate sexual reproduction, which increases the genetic diversity of a
population. This allows for greater variation within a species, which can
help that species adapt to changing circumstances and evolve.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Ploidy
Ploidy refers to the number of sets of chromosomes within the
cells of an organism. An organism or cell that has two sets of
chromosomes is called diploid (designated as 2N). A diploid
organism has one set of chromosomes from each parent, for a
total of two sets. When a cell or organism has only one set of
chromosomes, it is called haploid (1N or N). Note that diploid
organisms will produce haploid gametes, but their somatic cells
will be diploid. In some cases, cells have several sets of
