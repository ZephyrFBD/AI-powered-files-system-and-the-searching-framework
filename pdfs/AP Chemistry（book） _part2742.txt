 so pH = pKa. When does this happen during the titration? 
At the beginning of the titration, the acid is H3PO3 initially; at the first equivalence point, 
it is all converted to H2PO3
-. Therefore, halfway to the first equivalence point, half of the 
H3PO3 is converted to H2PO3
-. Thus, halfway to the equivalence point, the concentration

Phenolphthalein indicator
Color-change interval 8.3 < pH < 10.0
Methyl red indicator
Color-change interval 4.2 < pH < 6.0
Equivalence point
Equivalence point
Good choice. Suitable indicator for titration of a 
weak base with a strong acid because equivalence 
point falls within the color-change interval
Poor choice. Unsatisfactory indicator for titration 
of a weak base with a strong acid because color
changes before reaching equivalence point
