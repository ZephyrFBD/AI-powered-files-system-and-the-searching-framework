FIGURE 16–40 Replication of DNA.
Once replication starts, let us see how the correct order of bases occurs by
looking at the G molecule indicated by the red arrow in Fig. 16–40. Many unat-
tached nucleotide bases of all four kinds are bouncing around in the cellular
fluid, and the only type that will experience attraction to our G, if it comes close
to it, will be a C. The charges on the other three bases can not get close enough to
those on the G to provide a significant attractive force—remember that the
electrostatic (Coulomb) force decreases rapidly with distance
Because
the G does not attract an A, T, or G appreciably, an A, T, or G will be knocked
away by collisi
