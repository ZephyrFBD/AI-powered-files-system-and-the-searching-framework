he time 
it takes light to travel the given distance: for example,
The most common unit is the light-year (ly):
For specifying distances to the Sun and Moon, we usually use meters or kilo-
meters, but we could specify them in terms of light seconds or minutes. The
Earth–Moon distance is 384,000 km, which is 1.28 light-seconds. The Earth–Sun
distance is 
or 150,000,000 km; this is equal to 8.3 light-minutes (it
takes 8.3 min for light emitted by the Sun to reach us). Far out in our solar system,
Pluto is about

† The nearest star to us,
other than the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, about 4.2 ly away.
On a clear moonless night, thousands of stars of varying degrees of brightness
can be seen, as well as the long cloudy stripe known as the Milky Way (Fig. 33–1).
Galileo first observed, with his telescope, that the Milky Way is comprised of
countless individual stars. A century and a half later (about 1750), Thomas
Wright suggested that the Milky Way was a flat disk of stars ex
