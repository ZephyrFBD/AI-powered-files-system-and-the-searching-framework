3. Scoring the AP速 Biology Exam
Total scores on the multiple-choice section of the exam are based on the number of questions answered
correctly. Points are not deducted for incorrect answers or unanswered questions. The multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, and the free-response questions are scored by AP速 exam readers.
Free-response question scores are weighted and combined with the results of the machine-scored

score of 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1. These AP速 scores determine how qualified students are to receive college credit
