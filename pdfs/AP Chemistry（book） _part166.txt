he length of the cube is 2.00 cm?
SOLUTION
(a) We can calculate the amount of energy released from the 
propane as heat by converting the mass of propane from kg 
to g and then using the fact that 46 kJ of heat are released per 
gram:
E = 9.0 kg *
1000 g
1 kg
* 46 kJ
1 g
= 4.1 * 105 kJ = 4.1 * 108 J
SOLUTION
(a) We are given mass and volume, so Equation 1.3 yields
 
Density =
mass
volume =
1.00 * 102 g
7.36 cm3
= 13.6 g>cm3
(b) Solving Equation 1.3 for volume and then using the given mass 
 
and density gives 
Volume =
mass
density =
65.0 g
0.791 g>mL = 82.2 mL
(c) We can calculate the mass from the volume of the cube and its 
density. The volume of a cube is given by its length cubed:
 
Volume = 12.00 cm23 = 12.0023 cm3 = 8.00 cm3
 
Solving Equation 1.3 for mass and substituting the volume and 
density of the cube, we have
 Mass = volume * density = 18.00 cm32119.32 g>cm32 = 155 g
(b) When propane reacts with oxygen, the potential energy stored in 
the chemical bonds is converted to a
