asure an angle is about one degree (certainly not 0.1°).
So you can quote two significant figures, namely 30° (not 30.0°). (b) If you
enter cos 30° in your calculator, you will get a number like 0.866025403.
But the angle you entered is known only to two significant figures, so its cosine
is correctly given by 0.87; you must round your answer to two significant figures.
NOTE T
rigonometric functions, like cosine, are reviewed in Chapter 3 and Appendix A.
Scientific Notation
We commonly write numbers in “powers of ten,” or “scientific” notation—for
instance 36,900 as
or 0.0021 as
One advantage of
scientific notation (reviewed in Appendix A) is that it allows the number of
significant figures to be clearly expressed. For example, it is not clear whether
36,900 has three, four, or five significant figures. With powers of 10 notation 
the ambiguity can be avoided: if the number is known to three significant
figures, we write
but if it is known to four, we write
