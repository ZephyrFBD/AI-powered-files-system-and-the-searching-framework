Figure 12.4 Independent Assortment of Chromosomes in Metaphase I of Meiosis
Occasionally during the anaphase I stage of meiosis, pairs of homologous chromosomes fail to separate and will instead move to the same side of the
cell, eventually ending up in the same gamete. This is called nondisjunction. If the resulting gametes are fertilized, this can result in an aneuploidy,
which is when there is an atypical number of chromosomes. One example of an aneuploidy is Down syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, which can
result when an individual has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of two copies.
