d releases the wrong nucleotide. This is performed by the exonuclease action of DNA pol
III. Once the incorrect nucleotide has been removed, a new one will be added again.
Figure 14.17 Proofreading by DNA polymerase corrects errors during replication.
Some errors are not corrected during replication, but are instead corrected after replication is completed; this type of repair
is known as mismatch repair (Figure 14.18). The enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and excise it; this
is then replaced by the correct base. If this remains uncorrected, it may lead to more permanent damage. How do mismatch
repair enzymes recognize which of the two bases is the incorrect one? In E. coli, after replication, the nitrogenous base

lacks them. Thu
