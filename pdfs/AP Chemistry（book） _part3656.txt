rons cause the ferromagnetic substance to maintain a magnetic 
moment. We then refer to it as a permanent magnet (Figure 23.7).
The only ferromagnetic transition metals are Fe, Co, and Ni, but many alloys also 
exhibit ferromagnetism, which is in some cases stronger than the ferromagnetism of the 
pure metals. Particularly powerful ferromagnetism is found in compounds containing 
both transition metals and lanthanide metals. Two of the most important examples are 
SmCo5 and Nd2Fe14B.
Two additional types of magnetism involving ordered arrangements of unpaired 
electrons are depicted in Figure 23.6. In materials that exhibit antiferromagnetism 
[Figure 23.6(c)], the unpaired electrons on a given atom or ion align so that their spins 
are oriented in the direction opposite the spin direction on neighboring atoms. This 
means that the spin-up and spin-down electrons cancel each other. Examples of anti-
ferromagnetic substances are chromium metal, FeMn alloys, and such transition-metal
