erves as a storage place 
for glucose and helps to maintain a constant glucose level in the blood.
Cellulose [Figure 24.22(b)] forms the major structural unit of plants. Wood is 
about 50% cellulose; cotton fibers are almost entirely cellulose. Cellulose consists of 
an unbranched chain of glucose units, with molecular weights averaging more than 
500,000 amu. At first glance, this structure looks very similar to that of starch. In cel-
lulose, however, the glucose units are in the b form with each bridging oxygen atom 
pointing in the same direction as the CH2OH group in the ring to its left.
Because the individual glucose units have different relationships to one another 
in starch and cellulose, enzymes that readily hydrolyze starches do not hydrolyze cel-
lulose. Thus, you might eat a pound of cellulose and receive no caloric value from it 
even though the heat of combustion per unit mass is essentially the same for both cel-
lulose and starch. A pound of starch, in contrast, would
