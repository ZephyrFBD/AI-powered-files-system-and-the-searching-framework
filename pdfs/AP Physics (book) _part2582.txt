he light from the first lens before it forms an image, this technique still
works.

Measuring f for a diverging lens. To measure the focal
length of a diverging lens, a converging lens is placed in contact with it, as shown
in Fig. 23–45. The Sun’s rays are focused by this combination at a point 28.5 cm
behind the lenses as shown. If the converging lens has a focal length 
of 16.0 cm,
what is the focal length 
of the diverging lens? Assume both lenses are thin
and the space between them is negligible.
APPROACH The image distance for the first lens equals its focal length (16.0 cm)
since the object distance is infinity 
The position of this image, even though
it is never actually formed, acts as the object for the second (diverging) lens. We
apply the thin lens equation to the diverging lens to find its focal length, given
that the final image is at
SOLUTION Rays from the Sun are focused 28.5 cm behind the combination,
so the focal length of the total combination is
If the diverging le
