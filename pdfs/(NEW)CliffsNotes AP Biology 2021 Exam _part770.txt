on surrounding the cell is hypotonic (lower solute concentration) relative to the contents of the
cell, the net movement of water is into the cell. A healthy cell may not appear to change because the cell is already
exerting its maximum turgor pressure. To observe a change, replace a hypertonic solution (when the cell is
exhibiting plasmolysis) with a hypotonic solution to observe the expansion of the cell as turgor pressure is restored.
Note, however, that the plasmolyzed cell is not equivalent to the healthy cell, as the plasmolyzed cell has a lower
(more negative) solute potential as a result of having lost water (solutes are more concentrated).
3. When the solution surrounding the cell is isotonic (equal solute concentration) relative to the contents of the cell,
there is no net movement of water into or out of the cell. Similar to the hypotonic solution above, no observable
changes will occur in a healthy cell. But unlike the hypotonic solution, no change will also be observed if
