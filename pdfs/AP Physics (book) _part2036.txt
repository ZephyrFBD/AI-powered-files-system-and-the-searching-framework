 35%-efficient power plant to provide the yearly
needs of this household?
67. A small city requires about 15 MW of power. Suppose that
instead of using high-voltage lines to supply the power, the
power is delivered at 120 V. Assuming a two-wire line of
0.50-cm-diameter copper wire, estimate the cost of the
energy lost to heat per hour per meter. Assume the cost of
electricity is about 12 cents per kWh.

Electric Currents
68. A 1600-W hair dryer is designed for 117 V. (a) What will be
the percentage change in power output if the voltage drops
to 105 V? Assume no change in resistance. (b) How would
the actual change in resistivity with temperature affect your
answer?
69. The wiring in a house must be thick enough so it does not
become so hot as to start a fire. What diameter must a
copper wire be if it is to carry a maximum current of 35 A
and produce no more th
