tion. Free water would result from the opposite
reaction, for condensation reactions. Choice (B), adenine, results from the hydrolysis of DNA, as it is a
monomer of DNA. Choice (C), cholesterol, is a steroid and therefore does not undergo hydrolysis. Dipeptides,
(D), could result from the hydrolysis of proteins, which are composed of polypeptides.

C
All amino acids share a carboxylic acid group, COOH, labeled (B), and an amino-group, NH2, labeled (D).
They also share a hydrogen atom bound to the central carbon, (A). Differences in amino acids are defined by
variations in the fourth position called the R-group, labeled (C).

B
Phospholipids have a long fatty acid tail and a polar head group. The fatty acid tails associate in the membrane,
and the phospholipid head group associates with water at the boundary of the membrane. Nucleotides, (A), are
mostly polar and found in DNA and RNA. Water, (C), is polar and not found in plasma membranes. Amino
acids, (D), are zwitterionic, that is
