so for the reasons indicated in “A 
Closer Look: Limitations of Solubility Products” at the end of 
this section. Agreement between the measured solubility and 
that calculated from Ksp is usually best for salts whose ions have 
low charges (1+ and 1-) and do not react with water.
*This is strictly true only for very dilute solutions, for Ksp values change somewhat when the con-
centration of ionic substances in water is increased. However, we will ignore these effects, which 
are taken into consideration only for work that requires exceptional accuracy.

Solid silver chromate is added to pure water at 25 °C, and some of the solid remains undissolved. The mixture is stirred for 
several days to ensure that equilibrium is achieved between the undissolved Ag2CrO41s2 and the solution. Analysis of the 
equilibrated solution shows that its silver ion concentration is 1.3 * 10-4 M. Assuming that the Ag2CrO4 solution is saturated 
and that there are
