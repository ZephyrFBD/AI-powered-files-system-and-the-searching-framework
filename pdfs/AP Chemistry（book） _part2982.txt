 repair their 
environment in response, for example, to an oil spill. The 
efficiency of bacteria for “eating” hydrocarbons depends 
on the amount of oxygen in the system, pH, temperature, 
and many other factors. In a certain oil spill, hydrocarbons 
from the oil disappeared with a first-order rate constant of 
2 * 10-6 s-1. At that rate, how many days would it take for 
the hydrocarbons to decrease to 10% of their initial value?
 18.84  The standard enthalpies of formation of ClO and ClO2 are 
101 and 102 kJ>mol, respectively. Using these data and the 
thermodynamic data in Appendix C, calculate the overall 
enthalpy change for each step in the following catalytic 
cycle:
ClO1g2 + O31g2 ¡ ClO21g2 + O21g2
ClO21g2 + O1g2 ¡ ClO1g2 + O21g2
What is the enthalpy change for the overall reaction that 
results from these two steps?
 18.85  The main reason that distillation is a costly method for 
purifying water is the high energy required to heat and 
vaporize water. (a) Using the density, s
