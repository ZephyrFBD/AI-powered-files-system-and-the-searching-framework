h the circles of confusion will be small enough that the images will be
reasonably sharp. This is called the depth of field. For a sensor or film width of
36 mm (including 35-mm film cameras), the depth of field is usually based on
a maximum circle of confusion diameter of 0.030 mm, even 0.02 mm or 0.01 mm
for critical work or very large photographs. The depth of field varies with the 
lens opening. If the lens opening is smaller, only rays through the central part 
of the lens are accepted, and these form smaller circles of confusion for a given
object distance. Hence, at smaller lens openings, a greater range of object dis-
tances will fit within the circle of confusion criterion, so the depth of field is greater.
Smaller lens openings, however, result in reduced resolution due to diffraction
(discussed later in this Chapter). Best resolution is typically found around
