in molecules were exposed to is
hydrophilic.
(c) A transmembrane protein spans the entire width of a cell membrane. For amino acids
A F, N, and R, predict their location in the amino acids sequence of a transmembrane
protein in the template below. (1 point)
Prediction (1 point)
Protein structure and function depend upon a protein’s tertiary structure, which is determined by the protein’s
primary structure.
The solvent is hydrophilic.
Prediction (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Amino acids A and F will in the hydrophobic region of the cell membrane, and amino acids N
and R will be in the hydrophilic region of the cell membrane.
(d) Justify your predictions. (1 point)
Justification (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Amino acids A and F will be in the hydrophobic region of the cell membrane, and amino acids N and R will be in
the hydrophilic region of the cell membrane
Amino acids A and F are hydrophobic, so they will
