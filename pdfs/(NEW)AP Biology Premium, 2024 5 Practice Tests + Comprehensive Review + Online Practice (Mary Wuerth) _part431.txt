oteins from different
organisms provides evidence of evolution. When comparing the DNA sequence of a gene that is shared by
different organisms, the more recently the organisms share a common ancestor, the more similar their DNA
sequences will be. For example, the GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene in humans and
in chimpanzees is over 99% similar in sequence, but the similarity in the GAPDH gene in humans and in dogs
is only about 91% similar. This indicates that humans and chimpanzees share a more recent common ancestor
than humans and dogs. Molecular evidence is considered very strong evidence since environmental factors do
not usually change an organism’s DNA sequence.
Morphology—Homologous structures, which have common ancestry but different functions, also provide
evidence of evolution. For example, the number and arrangement of bones in human hands, bat wings, and
whale fins are very similar, indicating common ancestry and evidence of evolution.
