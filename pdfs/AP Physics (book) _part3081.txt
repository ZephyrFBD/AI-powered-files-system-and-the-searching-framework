energy for the electrons? Explain.
9. Explain how the photoelectric circuit of Fig. 27–6 could be
used in (a) a burglar alarm, (b) a smoke detector, (c) a photo-
graphic light meter.
10. (a) Does a beam of infrared photons always have less
energy than a beam of ultraviolet photons? Explain.
(b) Does a single photon of infrared light always have less
energy than a single photon of ultraviolet light? Why?
11. Light of 450-nm wavelength strikes a metal surface, and a
stream of electrons emerges from the metal. If light of the
same intensity but of wavelength 400 nm strikes the sur-
face, are more electrons emitted? Does the energy of the
emitted electrons change? Explain.
*12. If an X-ray photon is scattered by an electron, does the
photon’s wavelength change? If so, does it increase or
decrease? Explain.
*13. In both the photoelectric effect and in the Compton effect,
a photon collides with an electron causing the electron to
fly off. What is the difference between the two pr
