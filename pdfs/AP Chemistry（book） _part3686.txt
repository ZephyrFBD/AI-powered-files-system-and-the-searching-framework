NH3) and thus a larger equilibrium constant: K = 4.2 * 1010.
We can combine our two equations using Hess’s law 
 (Sec-
tion 5.6) to calculate the enthalpy, entropy, and free-energy changes 
that occur for en to replace ammonia as ligands on Cu(II):
3Cu(H2O)2(NH3)242+(aq) + en(aq) ∆ 
 
3Cu(H2O)2(en)42+(aq) + 2 NH3(aq)
 
∆H° = (-54 kJ) - (-46 kJ) = -8 kJ
 
∆S° = (+23 J>K) - (-8.4 J>K) = +31 J>K
 
∆G° = (-61 kJ) - (-43 kJ) = -18 kJ
Notice that at 27 °C, the entropic contribution (-T∆S°) to the 
free-energy change, ∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S° (Equation 19.12), is negative 
and greater in magnitude than the enthalpic contribution (∆H°). The 
equilibrium constant for the NH39en reaction, 1.4 * 103, shows that 
the replacement of NH3 by en is thermodynamically favorable.
The chelate effect is important in biochemistry and molecular 
biology. The additional thermodynamic stabilization provided by 
entropy effects helps stabilize biological metal–chelate complexes, 
such as porphyrins, and can allow chang
