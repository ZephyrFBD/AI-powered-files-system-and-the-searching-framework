Describe how the Hardy-Weinberg equation can be used to show the
evolution of a population.
(a)
Identify the null and alternative hypotheses for the evolution of the
beetles.
(b)
For several years, the 25-mile radius area experienced severe drought.
Predict the eﬀect the drought will have on the frequencies of green and
brown beetles.
(c)
Justify your prediction.
