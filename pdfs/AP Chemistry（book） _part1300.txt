which has only six electrons around the boron atom. The formal charge is zero on both 
B and F
, and we could complete the octet around boron by forming a double bond (recall 
that if there are not enough electrons to give the central atom an octet, a multiple bond 
may be the answer). In so doing, we see that there are three equivalent resonance struc-
tures (the formal charges are shown in red):

Each of these structures forces a fluorine atom to share additional electrons with the bo-
ron atom, which is inconsistent with the high electronegativity of fluorine. In fact, the 
formal charges tell us that this is an unfavorable situation. In each structure, the F atom 
involved in the B “F double bond has a formal charge of +1, while the less electronega-
tive B atom has a formal charge of -1. Thus, the resonance structures containing a B “F 
double bond are less important than the one in which there are fewer than an octet
