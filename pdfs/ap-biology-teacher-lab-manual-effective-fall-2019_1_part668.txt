particular point in time accurately, you must dry the organism. Obviously, this creates 
a problem if you wish to take multiple measurements on the same living organism. 
Another issue is that different organic compounds store different amounts of energy; 
in proteins and carbohydrates it is about 4 kcal/g dry weight and in fats it is 9 kcal/g of 
dry weight). As you plan your own investigation, take into consideration all the above 
information.

You and your teacher will select a model organism for this lab depending on time of 
year, availability, and cost. The following steps assume that you and your lab team are 
culturing about 30 to 40 Wisconsin Fast Plants as a model organism. Other plants can be 
used instead, including wild or native plants, but check with your teacher first. 
Step 1 In your lab notebook, design and construct a systems diagram to model energy 
capture and flow through a plant. Use annotations to help explain you
