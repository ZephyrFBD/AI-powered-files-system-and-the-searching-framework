 atom and 
its nucleus by imagining that if the hydrogen atom were as large as a football stadium, 
the nucleus would be the size of a small marble. Because the tiny nucleus carries most of 
the mass of the atom in such a small volume, it has an incredibly high density—on the 
order of 101391014 g>cm3. A matchbox full of material of such density would weigh over 
2.5 billion tons!
Figure 2.10  incorporates the features we have just discussed. Electrons play the 
major role in chemical reactions. The significance of representing the region containing
