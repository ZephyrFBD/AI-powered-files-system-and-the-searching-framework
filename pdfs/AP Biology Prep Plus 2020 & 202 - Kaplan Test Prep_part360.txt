o increasing temperature will also
increase the amount of free energy in the form of both heat and kinetic
energy (all the molecules will be moving faster). Because all of the
molecules in the system will be moving faster at a higher temperature,
there is an increased rate of collision between enzyme and substrate
molecules. In essence, there are more chance meetings.
The pH of the environment aﬀects the reactivity of enzymes in the same
way that temperature does, in that there is a level of peak activity.
In the above graph, you can see the peak activity for diﬀerent common
digestive enzymes. Pepsin, for example, has a peak activity at a very low
pH because it catalyzes reactions in the stomach, which is very acidic.
The peak activity for chymotrypsin occurs at a pH of 7 to 8, which is fairly
neutral. The pH of a system aﬀects protein activity by altering the
structure of the protein. Proteins have a tertiary structure based on the
electrochemical properties of the amino acids in the
