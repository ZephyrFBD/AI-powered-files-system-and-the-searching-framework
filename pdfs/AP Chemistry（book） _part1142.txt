mistry of the alkali metals is dominated by the loss of their 
outer ns1 electron to form cations. The 1s1 electron configuration of hydrogen suggests 
that its chemistry should have some resemblance to that of the alkali metals. The chem-
istry of hydrogen is much richer and more complex than that of the alkali metals, how-
ever, mainly because the ionization energy of hydrogen, 1312 kJ>mol, is higher than any 
metal and comparable to that of oxygen. As a result, hydrogen is a nonmetal that occurs 
as a colorless diatomic gas, H21g2, under most conditions.
The reactivity of hydrogen with nonmetals reflects its much greater tendency to 
hold on to its electron relative to the alkali metals. Unlike the alkali metals, hydrogen 
reacts with most nonmetals to form molecular compounds in which its electron is shared 
with, rather than completely transferred to, the other nonmetal. For example, we have 
seen that sodium metal reacts vigorously with chlorine gas to produce the ionic com-
