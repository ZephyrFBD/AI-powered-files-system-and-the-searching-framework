 given substance. The various curves
(labeled A, B, C, and D) show how the pressure varies as a function of volume
for four different values of constant temperature 
and 
The red
dashed curve 
represents the behavior of a gas as predicted by the ideal gas
law; that is,
The solid curve A represents the behavior of a real
gas at the same temperature. Notice that at high pressure, the volume of a 
real gas is less than that predicted by the ideal gas law. The curves B and C in
Fig. 13â€“21 represent the gas at successively lower temperatures, and we see that
the behavior deviates even more from the curves predicted by the ideal gas law
(for example,
), and the deviation is greater the closer the gas is to liquefying.
To explain this behavior, note that at higher pressure we expect the molecules
to be closer together. And at lower temperatures, the potential energy associated
with attractive forces between the molecules (which we ignored before) is no 
longer negligible. These attractive for
