Plant Cells Versus Animal Cells
Plant cells contain most of the same organelles and structures seen in animal cells, with several key exceptions.
Plant cells, unlike animal cells, have a protective outer covering called the cell wall (made of cellulose). A cell wall
is a rigid layer just outside the plasma membrane that provides support for the cell. It is found in plants, protists,
fungi, and bacteria. Cell walls are important for protection against osmotic changes as well. In fungi, the cell wall is
usually made of chitin, a modified polysaccharide. Chitin is also a principle component of an arthropodâ€™s
exoskeleton. In addition, plant cells possess chloroplasts, which have a double outer membrane. Chloroplasts
contain chlorophyll, the light-capturing pigment tha
