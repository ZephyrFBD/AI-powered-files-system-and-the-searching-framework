[14.111] Consider the hypothetical reaction 2 A + B ¡ 2 C + D. 
The following two-step mechanism is proposed for the re-
action:
Step 1:  A + B ¡ C + X
Step 2:  A + X ¡ C + D
 
 X is an unstable intermediate. (a) What is the predicted 
rate law expression if Step 1 is rate determining? (b) What 
is the predicted rate law expression if Step 2 is rate deter-
mining? (c) Your result for part (b) might be considered 
surprising for which of the following reasons: (i) The con-
centration of a product is in the rate law. (ii) There is a 
negative reaction order in the rate law. (iii) Both reasons 
(i) and (ii). (iv) Neither reasons (i) nor (ii).
 
[14.112] In a hydrocarbon solution, the gold compound 
1CH323AuPH3 decomposes into ethane 1C2H62 and a 
different gold compound, 1CH32AuPH3. The following 
mechanism has been proposed for the decomposition of 
1CH323AuPH3:
Step 1: 1CH323 AuPH3 ∆
