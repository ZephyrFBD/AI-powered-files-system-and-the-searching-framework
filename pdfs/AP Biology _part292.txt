Which of the following statements is best supported by the data
above?
Genes for the traits for height and seed coat are located far
apart on the same chromosome, and a crossover occurred.
Genes for the traits for height and seed coat are located close
together on the same chromosome, and a crossover occurred.
Genes for the traits for height and seed coat are on different
chromosomes and assorted independently.
These are the expected results from a cross between one parent
plant that is hybrid (tall with
