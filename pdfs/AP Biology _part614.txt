slocation. The sugar moves from the source, where it is produced in
the leaves, to the sink, where it is used or stored. The sink includes the
roots and fruits. Proton pumps create an electrochemical gradient that
powers the loading of sugar into sieve tubes of the phloem. Translocation
requires an input of energy.
Xylem fluid (water and minerals from the soil) rises in a plant against
gravity but requires no energy. The fluid in the xylem can be pushed up by
root pressure or pulled up by transpirational pull. Root pressure results
from water flowing into the stele from the soil as a result of the high
mineral content in the root cells. Root pressure can push xylem sap upward
only a few yards (meters). Droplets of water that appear in the morning on
the leaf tips of some herbaceous dicots, like strawberries, are due to root
pressure. This is known as guttation.
Transpirational pull can carry fluid up the worldâ€™s tallest trees.
Transpiration, the evaporation of water from leaves, causes
