l properties?
a.
Cellulose is formed by β -1,4 glycosidic
linkages and crosslinks, making it rigid. Starch
has α -1.4 and α -1.6 glycosidic linkages
without the tight crosslinks of cellulose.
b.
Cellulose has rigid α -1,4 glycosidic linkages
while starch has less rigid β -1,4 glycosidic
linkages
c.
Cellulose has amylose and amylopectin, making
it more rigid than starch.
d.
Starch has amylose and amylopectin that make it
more rigid than cellulose.
