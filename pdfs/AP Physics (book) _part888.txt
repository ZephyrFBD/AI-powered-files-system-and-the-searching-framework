are connected by a light string passing
over a pulley of radius 0.15 m and moment of inertia I.
The blocks move (towards the right) with an acceleration
of 
along their frictionless inclines (see Fig. 8–51).
(a) Draw free-body diagrams for each of the two blocks
and the pulley. (b) Determine 
and 
the tensions 
in the two parts of the string. (c) Find the net torque acting
on the pulley, and determine its moment of inertia, I.

41. (II) A dad pushes tangentially on a small hand-driven
merry-go-round and is able to accelerate it from rest to a
frequency of 15 rpm in 10.0 s. Assume the merry-go-round
is a uniform disk of radius 2.5 m and has a mass of 560 kg,
and two children (each with a mass of 25 kg) sit opposite
each other on the edge. Calculate the torque required
to produce the acceleration, neglecting frictional torque.
What force is required at the edge?
