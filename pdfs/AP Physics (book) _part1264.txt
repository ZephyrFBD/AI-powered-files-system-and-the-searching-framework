Assume that the amplitude of the wave is 0.50 m, the wave-
length is 2.5 m, and the period is 4.0 s.
86. A tsunami is a sort of pulse or “wave packet” consisting of 
several crests and troughs that become dramatically 
large as they enter shallow water at the shore. Suppose 
a tsunami of wavelength 235 km and velocity 
travels across the Pacific Ocean. As it approaches Hawaii,
people observe an unusual decrease of sea level in the 
harbors. Approximately how much time do they have to 
run to safety? (In the absence of knowledge and warning,
people have died during tsunamis, some of them attracted
to the shore to see stranded fishes and boats.)
