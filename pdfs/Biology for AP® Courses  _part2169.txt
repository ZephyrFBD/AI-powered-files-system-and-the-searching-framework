ct the distribution of phenotypes within a population. In
(a) stabilizing selection, an average phenotype is favored. In (b) directional selection, a change in the environment
shifts the spectrum of phenotypes observed. In (c) diversifying selection, two or more extreme phenotypes are
selected for, while the average phenotype is selected against.
Before the Industrial revolution light-colored moths were able to blend in with the environment and better avoid
predators. Since the Industrial Revolution, dark-colored moths are better camouflaged than light-colored moths. The
number of dark-colored moths has increased to be the most common color. This is an example of what?
a.
directional selection
b.
stabilizing selection
c.
frequency-dependent selection
d.
diversifying selection
Frequency-dependent Selection
Another type of selection, called frequency-dependent selection, favors phenotypes that are either common (positive
frequency-dependent selection) or rare (negative frequency-dependen
