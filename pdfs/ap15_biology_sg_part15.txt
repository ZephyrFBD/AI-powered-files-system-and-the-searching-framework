• 
In treatment III the cap blocks the light to the tip and the plant no longer bends toward light. 
 
(b) In treatment groups IV and V, the tips of the plants are removed and placed back onto the shoot on 
either a permeable or impermeable barrier. Using the results from treatment groups IV and V, 
describe TWO additional characteristics of the phototropism response.
