mately to produce
more ATP. This is an important example of how a cell regulates ATP
production through allosteric inhibition; see Figure 6.4. (Also see page

STRUCTURE OF THE MITOCHONDRION
The mitochondrion is enclosed by a double membrane. The outer
membrane is smooth, but the inner or cristae membrane is folded. This
inner 
membrane 
divides 
the 
mitochondrion 
into 
two 
internal
compartments, the outer compartment and the matrix. The Krebs, or

citric acid, cycle takes place in the matrix; the electron transport chain and
oxidative phosphorylation take place in the cristae membrane. Figure 6.5
shows a diagram of the mitochondrion.
