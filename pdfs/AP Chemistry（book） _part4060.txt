otassium. 
A body-centered cubic structure has more empty space than a face-
centered cubic one. The more empty space, the less dense the solid. 
We expect the element with the lowest density, potassium, to adopt 
the body-centered cubic structure. 12.33 (a) Structure types A and C 
have equally dense packing and are more densely packed than struc-
ture type B. (b) Structure type B is least densely packed. 12.35 (a) The 
radius of an Ir atom is 1.355 Å. (b) The density of Ir is 22.67 g  >  cm3 
12.37 (a) The radius of a Ca atom is 1.976 Å. (b) The density of Ca is 
1.526 g/cm3 12.39 (a) 4 Al atoms per unit cell (b) coordination num-
ber = 12 (c) a = 4.04 Å or 4.04 * 10-8 cm (d) density = 2.71 g  >  cm3 
12.41 Statement (b) is false. 12.43 (a) Interstitial alloy (b) substi-
tutional alloy (c) intermetallic compound 12.45 (a) True (b) false  
(c) false 12.47 (a) Nickel or palladium, substitutional alloy (b) cop-
per, substitutional alloy (c) silver, substitutional alloy 12.49 (a) True
