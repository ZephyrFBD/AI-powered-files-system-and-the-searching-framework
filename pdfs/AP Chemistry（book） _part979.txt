ther elements to avoid making the periodic table unduly wide. The properties 
of the lanthanide elements are all quite similar, and these elements occur together in 
nature. For many years it was virtually impossible to separate them from one another.
Because the energies of the 4f and 5d orbitals are very close to each other, the elec-
tron configurations of some of the lanthanides involve 5d electrons. For example, the 
elements lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), and praseodymium (Pr) have the following elec-
tron configurations:
3Xe46s25d1
3Xe46s25d14f 1
3Xe46s24f 3
Lanthanum
Cerium
Praseodymium
Because La has a single 5d electron, it is sometimes placed below yttrium (Y) as 
the first member of the third series of transition elements; Ce is then placed as the first 
member of the lanthanides. Based on its chemical properties, however, La can be con-
sidered the first element in the lanthanide series. Arranged this way, there are fewer 
apparent exceptions to the regular filling of the 4f
