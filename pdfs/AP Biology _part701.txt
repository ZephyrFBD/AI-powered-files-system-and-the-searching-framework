cle to contract.
The interneuron or association neuron resides within the spinal cord
and brain, receives sensory stimuli, and transfers the information
directly to a motor neuron or to the brain for processing.
The Reflex Arc
The simplest nerve response is a reflex arc. It is inborn, automatic, and
protective. An example is the knee-jerk reflex, which consists of only two
types of neurons: sensory and motor. A stimulus, a tap from a hammer, is
felt in the sensory neuron of the kneecap, which sends an impulse to the
motor neuron, which directs the thigh muscle to contract. A more complex
reflex arc consists of three neurons: sensory, motor, and interneurons or
association neurons; see Figure 16.5. A sensory neuron transmits an
impulse to the interneuron in the spinal cord, which sends one impulse to
the brain for processing and also one to the motor neuron to effect change
immediately (at the muscle). This is the type of response that quickly jerks
