sually occur simultaneously in
populations and are not isolated events. It is hard to determine which process dominates because it is often nearly impossible
to determine the cause of change in allele frequencies at each occurrence. An event that initiates an allele frequency change
in an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population, is called the founder effect. Natural
selection, random drift, and founder effects can lead to significant changes in the genome of a population.
Hardy–Weinberg Principle of Equilibrium
In the early twentieth century, English mathematician Godfrey Hardy and German physician Wilhelm Weinberg stated
the principle of equilibrium to describe the genetic makeup of a population. The theory, which later became known as
the Hardy–Weinberg principle of equilibrium, states that a population’s allele and genotype frequencies are inherently
stable—unless some kind of evolutionary force is acting upon the population, neither the alle
