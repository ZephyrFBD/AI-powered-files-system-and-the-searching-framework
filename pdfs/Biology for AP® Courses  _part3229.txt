 mechanical wave into an electrical signal (as illustrated
in Figure 27.14). Inside the cochlea, the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea,
curling toward the cochleaâ€™s center.
The mechanical properties of the basilar membrane change along its length, such that it is thicker, tauter, and narrower at
the outside of the whorl (where the cochlea is largest), and thinner, floppier, and broader toward the apex, or center, of the
whorl (where the cochlea is smallest). Different regions of the basilar membrane vibrate according to the frequency of the
sound wave conducted through the fluid in the cochlea. For these reasons, the fluid-filled cochlea detects different wave
frequencies (pitches) at different regions of the membrane. When the sound waves in the cochlear fluid contact the basilar
membrane, it flexes back and forth in a wave-like fashion. Above the basilar membrane is the tectorial membrane.
