Similarly, when one car traveling 
passes a second car traveling in
the same direction at 
the first car has a speed relative to the second car
of
When the velocities are along the same line, simple addition or subtraction is
sufficient to obtain the relative velocity. But if they are not along the same line, we
must make use of vector addition. We emphasize, as mentioned in Section 2–1, that
when specifying a velocity, it is important to specify what the reference frame is.
When determining relative velocity, it is easy to make a mistake by adding
or subtracting the wrong velocities. It is important, therefore, to draw a diagram
and use a careful labeling process. Each velocity is labeled by two subscripts:
the first refers to the object, the second to the reference frame in which it has this
velocity. For example, suppose a boat heads directly across a river, as shown 
in Fig. 3–28. We let 
be the velocity of the B
