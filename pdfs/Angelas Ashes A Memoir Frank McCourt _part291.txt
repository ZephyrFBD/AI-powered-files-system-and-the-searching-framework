 There’s a lovely smell from the dinner can, boiled bacon and cabbage 
 
 and two big floury white potatoes. Surely he won’t notice if I try 
 
 136 
 
 half a potato. He won’t complain to Grandma because he hardly ever 
 
  
  
 talks outside of a snuffle or two. 
 
 It’s better if I eat the other half potato so that he won’t be asking 
 
 why he got a half. I might as well try the bacon and cabbage too and if 
 
 I eat the other potato he’ll surely think she didn’t send one at all. 
 
 The second potato melts in my mouth and I’ll have to try another 
 
 bit of cabbage, another morsel of bacon.There isn’t much left now and 
 
 he’ll be very suspicious so I might as well finish off the rest. 
 
 What am I going to do now? Grandma will destroy me,Mam will 
 
 keep me in for a year. Bill Galvin will bury me in lime. I’ll tell him I was 
 
 attacked by a dog on the Dock Road and he ate the whole dinner and 
 
 I’m lucky I escaped without being eaten myself. 
 
 Oh, is that
