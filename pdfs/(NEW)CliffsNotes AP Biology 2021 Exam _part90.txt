Structurally,
both flagella and cilia consist of microtubules arranged in a “9 + 2” array—nine pairs (doublets) of microtubules
arranged in a circle surrounding a pair of microtubules (Figure 3-4).

11. Centrioles and basal bodies act as microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs). A pair of centrioles (enclosed
in a centrosome) located outside the nuclear envelope gives rise to the microtubules that make up the spindle
apparatus used during cell division. Basal bodies organize the development of flagella and cilia and anchor them to
the cell surface. Both centrioles and basal bodies are made up of nine triplets of microtubules arranged in a circle
(Figure 3-4). Plant cells lack centrioles and only lower plants (such as mosses and ferns) with motile sperm have
flagella and basal bodies.
12. Vacuoles and vesicles are fluid-filled, membrane-bound bodies. 
Transport vesicles move materials between organelles or between organelles and the plasma membrane.
Food vacuoles are temporary r
