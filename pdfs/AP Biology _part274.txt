Some traits are not sex-linked but are instead sex-limited, where expression depends
on the sex of the individual. Human males cannot produce milk even though they have

A son has a 50 percent chance of inheriting a sex-linked trait from a
carrier mother (shaded square).
There is no carrier state for X-linked traits in males. If a male has
the gene, he will express it.
It is uncommon for a female to have a
