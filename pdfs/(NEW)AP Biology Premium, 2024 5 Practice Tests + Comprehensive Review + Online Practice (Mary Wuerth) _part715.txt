Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR gene codes for a protein that functions as a gated membrane channel
that helps control the flow of chloride ions from inside the cytosol of the cell to the extracellular fluid outside the
cell. When the CFTR protein is not functioning properly, not enough chloride ions exit the cell and the mucus in the
extracellular fluid becomes dehydrated, thick, and viscous.
The fully functional form of the CFTR protein is translated from 27 exons in the CFTR gene. Not everyone with
cystic fibrosis has the same mutation in the CFTR gene; currently five classes of mutations that can cause cystic
fibrosis have been identif
