wastes are concentrated in what will eventually be excreted as urine. The hypothalamus controls the mechanisms of ADH
secretion, either by regulating blood volume or the concentration of water in the blood. Dehydration or physiological stress
can cause an increase of osmolarity above 300 mOsm/L, which in turn, raises ADH secretion and water will be retained,
causing an increase in blood pressure. ADH travels in the bloodstream to the kidneys. Once at the kidneys, ADH changes
the kidneys to become more permeable to water by stimulating the temporary insertion of water channels, aquaporins, into
the kidney tubules. Water moves out of the kidney tubules through the aquaporins, reducing urine volume. The water is
reabsorbed into the capillaries, lowering blood osmolarity back toward normal. As blood osmolarity decreases, a negative
feedback mechanism
