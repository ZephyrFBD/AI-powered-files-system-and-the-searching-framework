ng the development of C. elegans,131 cells, always the same cells, are destroyed
when celldeath genes (Ced genes) are activated during the normal course of development.
During early stages of development, webbing connects the spaces between fingers and between toes of humans and
other animals. Later, during normal embryonic development, however, the cells that make up the webbing undergo
apoptosis, allowing the fingers and toes to form separate, unattached digits. For ducks and other animals, where
webbing remains, activation of the genes that initiate apoptosis is inhibited.
Mechanisms That Control Gene Expression
External and internal signals turn on (or off) the expression of genes. Genes are expressed when their nucleotide
sequences are transcribed to produce RNAs. If the RNA is an mRNA, it may produce a protein that contributes to
the specialization of the cell. Specialized cells form tissues, different tissues combine to form organs, and a
multicellular organism forms. Mechanisms
