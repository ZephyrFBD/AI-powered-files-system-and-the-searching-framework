 (called the TATA
box).
2. Elongation occurs as the RNA polymerase unzips the DNA and assembles RNA nucleotides using one strand of
the DNA as a template. As in DNA replication, elongation of the RNA molecule occurs in the 5′ → 3′ direction. In
contrast to DNA replication, new nucleotides are RNA nucleotides (rather than DNA nucleotides), only one DNA
strand is transcribed, and primers are not required.
3. Termination occurs when the RNA polymerase reaches a special sequence of nucleotides that serve as a
termination point.
mRNA Processing
Before the mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus, it undergoes the following alterations:
1. A 5 ′ cap (–P–P–P (–P–P–G-5′) is added to the 5′ end of the mRNA (see 5 in Figure 9-5). The 5′ cap is a guanine
nucleotide with two additional phosphate groups, forming GTP (in the same way that ATP is an adenine nucleotide
with two additional phosphates). Capping provides stability to the mRNA and a point of attachment for the small
subunit of the ribosome.
2. A
