†The speed of an object falling in air (or other fluid) does not increase indefinitely. If the object falls
far enough, it will reach a maximum velocity called the terminal velocity due to air resistance.

object dropped from a tower falls
with progressively greater speed 
and covers greater distance with
each successive second. (See also
