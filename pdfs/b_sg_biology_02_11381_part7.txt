2. (b) 
Design a controlled experiment to determine the relationship between intensity of exercise and heart  
rate. (4 points maximum) 
 
• 
hypothesis statement/prediction of results 
• 
correctly describe the concept of a “control” group (baseline, resting) 
• 
specify matched subjects (age, sex, fitness, twins, etc.) 
• 
describe parameters of the exercise protocol 
• 
describe how the heart rate will be measured (e.g., pulse, EKG, etc.) 
• 
specify all other conditions stay the same (only one independent variable) 
• 
statistical analysis  
• 
large sample size/repetition (reliability)
