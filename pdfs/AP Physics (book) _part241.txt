–3),
whereas 
equals 15 km,
which is the total distance traveled. Note also that we cannot set 
equal to
11.2 km, because we have a vector equation and 11.2 km is only a part of the
resultant vector, its magnitude. We could write something like this, though:
Figure 3–3 illustrates the general rules for graphically adding two vectors
together, no matter what angles they make, to get their sum. The rules are as
follows:
1. On a diagram, draw one of the vectors—call it 
—to scale.
2. Next draw the second vector,
to scale, placing its tail at the tip of the 
first vector and being sure its direction is correct.
3. The arrow drawn from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the second
vector represents the sum, or resultant, of the two vectors.
The length of the resultant vector represents its magnitude. Note that vectors can
be moved parallel to themselves on paper (maintaining the same length and
angle) to accomplish these manipulations. The length of the resultant can be 
measured wi
