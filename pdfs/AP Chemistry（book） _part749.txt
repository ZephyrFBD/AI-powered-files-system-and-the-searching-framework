ction from the tabulated ∆H values of 
other reactions. Thus, it is not necessary to make calorimetric measurements for all 
reactions.
 
We can use ∆T and the value for Ccal to calculate the heat of  
reaction (Equation 5.23):
We can readily convert this value to the heat of reaction for a 
mole of CH6N2:
a
-113.0 kJ
4.00 g CH6N2
b * a
46.1 g CH6N2
1 mol CH6N2
b = -1.30 * 103 kJ>mol CH6N2
qrxn = -Ccal * ∆T = -17.794 kJ>°C2114.50 °C2 = -113.0 kJ
Check The units cancel properly, and the sign of the answer is neg-
ative as it should be for an exothermic reaction. The magnitude of 
the answer seems reasonable.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
The combustion of exactly 1.000 g of benzoic acid in a bomb 
calorimeter releases 26.38 kJ of heat. If the combustion 
of 0.550 g of benzoic acid causes the temperature of the 
calorimeter to increase from 22.01 to 24.27 °C, calculate the 
heat capacity of the calorimeter. 
(a) 0.660 kJ>°C  (b) 6.42 kJ>°C (c) 14.5 kJ>°C  
(d) 21.2 kJ>g@°C (e) 32.7 kJ>°C
