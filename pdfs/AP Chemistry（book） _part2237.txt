n the energy of the 
starting molecule and the highest energy along the reaction path-
way is the activation energy, Ea. The molecule having the arrange-
ment of atoms shown at the top of the barrier is called either the 
activated complex or the transition state.
The conversion of H3C ¬N ‚C to H3C ¬C ‚N is exother-
mic. Figure 14.16 therefore shows the product as having a lower 
energy than the reactant. The energy change for the reaction, ∆E, 
has no effect on reaction rate, however.
 
The rate constant depends on the magnitude of Ea; generally,  
the lower the value of Ea is, the larger the rate constant and  
the faster the reaction.
Notice that the reverse reaction is endothermic. The activation 
energy for the reverse reaction is equal to the energy that must be 
overcome if approaching the barrier from the right: ∆E + Ea. Thus, 
to reach the activated complex for the reverse reaction requires more 
energy than for the forward reaction—for this reaction, there is a larger 
barrie
