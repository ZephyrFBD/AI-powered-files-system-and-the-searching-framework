trolled, making the collection of diffraction data highly automated. 
The diffraction pattern of a crystal can be determined very accurately 
and quickly (sometimes in a matter of hours), even though thou-
sands of diffraction spots are measured. Computer programs are then 
used to analyze the diffraction data and determine the arrangement 
and structure of the molecules in the crystal. X-ray diffraction is an 
important technique in industries ranging from steel and cement 
manufacture to pharmaceuticals.

▲ Figure 12.9 Diffraction of X rays by a crystal. A monochromatic X-ray beam is passed through 
a crystal. The X rays are diffracted, and the resulting interference pattern is recorded. The crystal 
is rotated and another diffraction pattern recorded. Analysis of many diffraction patterns gives the 
positions of the atoms in
