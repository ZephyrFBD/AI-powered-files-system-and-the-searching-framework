sical environment, how the environment affects
species, and how environmental changes impact the distribution of a species; it has also been critical to
developing evolutionary theory. Biogeographers need to understand both biology and ecology. They also
need to be well-versed in evolutionary studies, soil science, and climatology.
There are three main fields of study under the heading of biogeography: ecological biogeography, historical
biogeography (called paleobiogeography), and conservation biogeography. Ecological biogeography
studies the current factors affecting the distribution of plants and animals. Historical biogeography, as the
name implies, studies the past distribution of species. Conservation biogeography, on the other hand, is
focused on the protection and restoration of species based upon known historical and current ecological
information. Each of these fields considers both zoogeography and phytogeographyâ€”the past and present
distribution of animals and plants.
