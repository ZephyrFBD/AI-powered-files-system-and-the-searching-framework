15. Food choices that reduce the amount of nitrogenous bases in the diet

Why does gout often result in pain?
a.
The urethra swells, making urination slower and more painful.
b.
Uric acid crystals build up in the joints, resulting in painful body movements.
c.
Ammonia begins to degrade the linking of the bladder, causing constant pain.
d.
Urea is always highly concentrated, resulting in kidney stones that make urination painful.
