ensity until the baby is forced out of
the uterus.
When lactating, a mother's milk production increases in response to an increase in nursing.
During sexual activity, sensitivity and stimulation increase until an orgasm is reached.
Staying alive requires energy. How much energy? As expected, larger organisms need more energy than smaller
organisms. Unexpectedly, however, the amount of energy required per unit weight decreases as the size of the
animal increases. An elephant, for example, uses much less energy per kilogram of weight than does a mouse. One
explanation for this is that thermoregulation is more costly for smaller animals because their surface area to volume
ratio is larger than it is for larger animals (more area for heat to escape). Another possible explanation is that there is
efficiency in numbers. The cost of servicing a single cell may decrease as the number of cells to service increases.
