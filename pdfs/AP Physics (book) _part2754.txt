86. A series of polarizers are each rotated 10° from the previ-
ous polarizer. Unpolarized light is incident on this series of
polarizers. How many polarizers does the light have to go
through before it is
of its original intensity?
87. The wings of a certain beetle have a series of parallel lines
across them. When normally incident 480-nm light is
reflected from the wing, the wing appears bright when
viewed at an angle of 56°. How far apart are the lines?
88. A teacher stands well back from an outside doorway
0.88 m wide, and blows a whistle of frequency 950 Hz.
Ignoring reflections, estimate at what angle(s) it is not
possible to hear the whistle clearly on the playground outside
the doorway. Assume 
for the speed of sound.
89. Light is incident on a diffraction grating with
