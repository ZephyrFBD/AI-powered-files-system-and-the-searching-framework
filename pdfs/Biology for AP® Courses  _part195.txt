 by warm blooded animals to
more evenly disperse heat in their bodies: it acts in a similar manner to a car’s cooling system, transporting heat from warm
places to cool places, causing the body to maintain a more even temperature.
Water’s Heat of Vaporization
Water also has a high heat of vaporization, the amount of energy required to change one gram of a liquid substance to a
gas. A considerable amount of heat energy (586 cal) is required to accomplish this change in water. This process occurs on
the surface of water. As liquid water heats up, hydrogen bonding makes it difficult to separate the liquid water molecules
from each other, which is required for it to enter its gaseous phase (steam). As a result, water acts as a heat sink or heat
reservoir and requires much more heat to boil than does a liquid such as ethanol, whose hydrogen bonding with other ethanol
molecules is weaker than water’s hydrogen bonding. Eventually, as water reaches its boiling point of 100° Celsius (212°
