etitive inhibition,
an inhibitor molecule binds to the enzyme in a location other than an allosteric site and still manages to block substrate
binding to the active site.
Figure 6.17 Competitive and noncompetitive inhibition affect the rate of reaction differently. Competitive inhibitors
affect the initial rate but do not affect the maximal rate, whereas noncompetitive inhibitors affect the maximal rate.
Some inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding induces a conformational change that reduces
the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. This type of inhibition is called allosteric inhibition (Figure 6.18). Most
allosterically regulated enzymes are made up of more than one polypeptide, meaning that they have more than one protein
subunit. When an allosteric inhibitor binds to an enzyme, all active sites on the protein subunits are changed slightly such
that they bind their substrates with less efficiency. There are allosteric activators as well as inhibito
