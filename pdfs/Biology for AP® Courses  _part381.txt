be sufficient to
have any effect on the function and structure of
the protein.
b.
The amino acid may not show any significant
effect the protein structure and function or it
may have a significant effect, as in the case of
hemoglobin in individuals with sickle cell trait.
c.
These changes would increase the possibility of
having extra bends and loops in the proteins as
in Leber congenital disease.
d.
These changes would modify the structures of
proteins making them nonfunctional.

72. For many years, scientist believed that proteins were
the source of heritable information. There are many
thousands of different proteins in a cell, and they mediate
the cellâ€™s metabolism, producing the traits and
characteristics of a species. Researchers working with
