Metabolism
The processes of photosynthesis and cellular metabolism consist of several very complex pathways. It is
generally thought that the first cells arose in an aqueous environment—a “soup” of nutrients—probably on
the surface of some porous clays. If these cells reproduced successfully and their numbers climbed steadily,
it follows that the cells would begin to deplete the nutrients from the medium in which they lived as they
shifted the nutrients into the components of their own bodies. This hypothetical situation would have resulted
in natural selection favoring those organisms that could exist by using the nutrients that remained in their
environment and by manipulating these nutrients into materials upon which they could survive. Selection
would favor those organisms that could extract maximal value from the nutrients to which they had access.
An early form of photosynthesis developed that harnessed the sun’s energy using water as a source
of hydrogen atoms, but this pathway
