Identify BOTH pigments:  
Graph 1 = bacteriorhodopsin AND graph 2 = chlorophyll a 
Explain that an organism containing bacteriorhodopsin appears purple because the pigment 
absorbs light in the green range of the light spectrum and/or reflects violet or red and blue light. 
The reflected red and blue light appears purple. 
Explain that an organism containing chlorophyll a appears green because the pigment absorbs

Question 2 (continued) 
 
 (b) In an experiment, identical organisms containing the pigment from Graph II as the predominant 
light-capturing pigment are separated into three groups. The organisms in each group are 
illuminated with light of a single wavelength (650 nm for the first group, 550 nm for
