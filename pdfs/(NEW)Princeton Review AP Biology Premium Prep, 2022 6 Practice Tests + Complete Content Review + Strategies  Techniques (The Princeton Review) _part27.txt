Questions 18â€“21 refer to the following passage.
A chain of three small islands was found to be the home to a small species of mouse. The angle of jaw opening
was found to vary significantly. The average size angle of the maximal jaw opening found in mice at 10 locations on
the three small islands is shown in Figure 1, below.
