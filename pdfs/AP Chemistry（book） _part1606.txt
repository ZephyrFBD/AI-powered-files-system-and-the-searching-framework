ion of molecular speeds for nitrogen gas. (a) The effect of temperature on  
molecular speed. The relative area under the curve for a range of speeds gives the relative fraction  
of molecules that have those speeds. (b) Position of most probable 1ump2, average 1uav2, and root- 
mean-square 1urms2 speeds of gas molecules. The data shown here are for nitrogen gas at 0 °C.
Estimate the fraction of molecules at 100 °C with speeds less than 300 m>s.
2. Negligible molecular volume The combined volume of all the molecules of 
the gas is negligible relative to the total volume in which the gas is contained.
3. Negligible forces Attractive and repulsive forces between gas molecules are 
negligible.
4. Constant average kinetic energy Energy can be transferred between mole-
cules during collisions but, as long as temperature remains constant, the average 
kinetic energy of the molecules does not change with time.
5. Average kinetic energy proportional to temperature The average kinetic 
energy o
