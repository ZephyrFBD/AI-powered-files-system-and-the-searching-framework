of a wavelength, constructive interference will always
occur.
(b)
of a wavelength, destructive interference will always
occur.
(c)
of a wavelength, constructive interference will always
occur.

24–3 Double-Slit Interference
1. (I) Monochromatic light falling on two slits 0.018 mm apart
produces the fifth-order bright fringe at an 8.6° angle. What
is the wavelength of the light used?
2. (I) The third-order bright fringe of 610-nm light is observed
at an angle of 31° when the light falls on
