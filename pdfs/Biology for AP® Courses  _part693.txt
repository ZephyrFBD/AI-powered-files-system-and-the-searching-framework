 car gradually increases through rust and degradation. Molecules and
chemical reactions have varying amounts of entropy as well. For example, as chemical reactions reach a state of equilibrium,
entropy increases, and as molecules at a high concentration in one place diffuse and spread out, entropy also increases.
Transfer of Energy and the Resulting Entropy
Set up a simple experiment to understand how energy is transferred and how a change in entropy results.
1.
Take a block of ice. This is water in solid form, so it has a high structural order. This means that the
molecules cannot move very much and are in a fixed position. The temperature of the ice is 0Â°C. As a
result, the entropy of the system is low.
2.
Allow the ice to melt at room temperature. What is the state of molecules in the liquid water now? How
did the energy transfer take place? Is the entropy of the system higher or lower? Why?
3.
Heat the water to its boiling point. What happens to the entropy of the system when the w
