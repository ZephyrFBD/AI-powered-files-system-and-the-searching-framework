ral factors that can change the progression of events that
generate the proteome.
Metabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics. Metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites
found in an organism. The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an
organism. Metabolomics offers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics, as well as genetic
makeup and environmental factors. The goal of metabolome research is to identify, quantify, and catalogue all of the
metabolites that are found in the tissues and fluids of living organisms.
Basic Techniques in Protein Analysis
The ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify or compare the proteins expressed from a given genome under specific
conditions, study the interactions between the proteins, and use the information to predict cell behavior or develop drug
targets. Just as the genome is analyzed using the basic technique of DNA sequencing, proteomics requi
