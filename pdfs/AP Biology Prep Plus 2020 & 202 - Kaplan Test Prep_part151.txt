like any other
passive diﬀusion in terms of movement from high → low concentration,
it is generally stated that water moves from an area of lower solute
concentration to one of higher solute concentration.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Water Potential
The flow of water in a system is determined by its water potential
(Ψ), which is a measure of the potential energy in water. Water
potential can be described as the sum of pressure potential (ΨP)
and solute potential (ΨS). At atmospheric pressure, the pressure
potential of water in an open container is zero and equal to the
solute potential. Adding solute decreases solute potential (makes
it more negative) and in turn decreases water potential. Negative
hydrostatic pressures will also decrease water potential. The
gradient of water potential causes water to move (from high to
low water potential). In plants, water potential is regulated by
osmosis and transpiration to transport water from the roots to the
leaves for photosynthesis.
