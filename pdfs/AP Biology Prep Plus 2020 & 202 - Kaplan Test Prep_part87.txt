s in biology concerns the origin of life.
While evolution is universally accepted among biologists, there is still
disagreement concerning how the whole process began. Evolution, as we
currently understand it, depends not merely on the existence of heritable
information in the form of genes, but also on the numerous enzymes and
other cellular structures that facilitate the replication of those genes and
the transmission of them to oï¬€spring. The question then emerges: how
did genes, enzymes, and cells come about in the first place?
There are some generally accepted points of agreement. Scientists
estimate that the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old and that, in the
beginning, it was a very inhospitable place. When Earth first came into
existence, there was very little or no atmospheric oxygen, and the surface
of the Earth was bombarded by intense ultraviolet radiation. Around 3.9
billion years ago, there were heavy rains and violent storms, which led to
the production of basic inorgan
