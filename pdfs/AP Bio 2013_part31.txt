te on Tribolium populations? 
(A) T. confusum is adversely affected by the 
parasite, while T. castaneum is not. 
(B) T. castaneum is adversely affected by the 
parasite, while T. confusum is not. 
(C) Both T. confusum and T. castaneum are 
adversely affected by the parasite. 
(D) Both T. confusum and T. castaneum show 
increased fitness in the presence of the 
parasite. 
 
12. In Figure I, the difference between the two curves 
can best be attributed to which of the following? 
(A) The difference between controlled laboratory 
conditions and the natural environment 
(B) The effect of the host on its parasite 
(C) The influence of competition for limited 
resources 
(D) The natural variation among populations 
 
13. If the experiment was continued for an additional 
500 days, the population density of T. castaneum 
with the parasite would most likely stabilize at a 
value closest to which of the following? 
(A)  5 beetles/culture dish 
(B) 10 beetles/culture dish 
(C) 20 beetles/cultur
