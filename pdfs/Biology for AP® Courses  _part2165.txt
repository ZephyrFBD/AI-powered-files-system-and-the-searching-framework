st floor and are less likely to be spotted by predators. Assuming the ground is a
fairly consistent shade of brown, those mice whose fur is most closely matched to that color will be most likely to survive
and reproduce, passing on their genes for their brown coat. Mice that carry alleles that make them a bit lighter or a bit darker
will stand out against the ground and be more likely to fall victim to predation. As a result of this selection, the populationâ€™s
genetic variance will decrease.
Directional Selection
When the environment changes, populations will often undergo directional selection (Figure 19.9), which selects for
phenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation. A classic example of this type of selection is the evolution
of the peppered moth in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the moths were
predominately light in color, which allowed them to blend in with the light-colored trees and lichens in their environment.
