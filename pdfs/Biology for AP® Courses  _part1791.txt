4.A
Interactions within biological systems lead to complex properties.
Essential
Knowledge
4.A.3 Interactions between external stimuli and regulated gene expression result in
specialization of cells, tissues and organs.

1.3 The student can refine representations and models of natural or man-made phenomena
and systems in the domain.

Objective
4.7 The student is able to refine representations to illustrate how interactions between
external stimuli and gene expression result in specialization of cells, tissues, and organs.
After the RNA has been transported to the cytoplasm, it is translated into protein. Control of this process is largely
dependent on the RNA molecule. As previously discussed, the stability of the RNA will have a large impact on its
translation into a protein. As the stability changes, the amount of time that it is available for translation also changes.
