ry well equipped to make their living out of a vast array of
nutrients and conditions. To live, prokaryotes need a source of energy, a source of carbon, and some additional nutrients.
Macronutrients
Cells are essentially a well-organized assemblage of macromolecules and water. Recall that macromolecules are produced
by the polymerization of smaller units called monomers. For cells to build all of the molecules required to sustain life, they
need certain substances, collectively called nutrients. When prokaryotes grow in nature, they obtain their nutrients from
the environment. Nutrients that are required in large amounts are called macronutrients, whereas those required in smaller
or trace amounts are called micronutrients. Just a handful of elements are considered macronutrientsâ€”carbon, hydrogen,
