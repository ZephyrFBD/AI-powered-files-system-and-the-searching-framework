atalyzed by hexokinase, an enzyme with broad specificity that catalyzes
the phosphorylation of six-carbon sugars. Hexokinase phosphorylates glucose using ATP as the source of the phosphate,
producing glucose-6-phosphate, a more reactive form of glucose. This reaction prevents the phosphorylated glucose
molecule from continuing to interact with the GLUT proteins, and it can no longer leave the cell because the negatively
charged phosphate will not allow it to cross the hydrophobic interior of the plasma membrane.
Step 2. In the second step of glycolysis, an isomerase converts glucose-6-phosphate into one of its isomers,
fructose-6-phosphate. An isomerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a molecule into one of its isomers. (This
change from phosphoglucose to phosphofructose allows the eventual split of the sugar into two three-carbon molecules.).
Step 3. The third step is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase. A
