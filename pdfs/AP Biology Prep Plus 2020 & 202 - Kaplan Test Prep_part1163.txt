les, will increase the
blood pressure (imagine taking a rubber pipe and squeezing to decrease
the diameter; the fluid inside the pipe will be under more pressure). (A)
and (C) can be eliminated. Furthermore, given that an increase in blood
pressure increases parasympathetic and decreases sympathetic activity, a
drop in blood pressure must do the opposite: decrease parasympathetic
and increase sympathetic activity. An increase in heart rate is associated
with increased sympathetic activity. Therefore, (D) is correct.
46. B
Normally, hemichannels at nonjunctions remain closed. The attachment
of Citrobacter rodentium disrupts normal cellular function, increasing
connexon protein levels during infection. This suggests that unpaired
hemichannels are opened. The opening of unpaired hemichannels would
allow small molecules and ions to leak out of intestinal cells into the
lumen of the colon. This change in concentration gradient, in turn, would
cause water to flow into the lumen, resulting in
