edians do not change:
Data Set C: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100
Data Set D: 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 100
Using the mean and median alone are often not enough to accurately describe a data set. It is also important to
use descriptive statistics that describe the spread of a data set. Standard deviation and standard error of the mean can
be used to describe how spread out the data points are.
You will not be required to calculate standard deviation or standard error of the mean on the AP Biology exam. However, it is important to understand
what standard deviation and standard error of the mean can tell you about a data set. You also must be able to use standard error of the mean to
construct 95% confidence intervals.
Standard deviation (s) averages how far each data point is from the mean of the data set. The formula for
standard deviation is:
Hereâ€™s how you would calculate the standard deviation for data set A and data set B:
Data Set A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 
 and n = 5
Data Set B: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3; 
 and n =
