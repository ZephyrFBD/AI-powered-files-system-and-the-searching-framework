 n, since we are given P and T,
and can find V from the given radius.
SOLUTION We get the volume V from the formula for a sphere:
The pressure is given as
The temperature must
be expressed in kelvins, so we change 20°C to
Finally,
we use the value
because we are using SI units. Thus
The mass of helium (
as given in the Periodic Table
or Appendix B) can be obtained from
or 4.26 * 10–3 kg.

mass = n * molecular mass = (1.066 mol)(4.00 gmol)
