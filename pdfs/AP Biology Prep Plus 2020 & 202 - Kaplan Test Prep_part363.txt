CHAPTER:
All enzymes possess an active site, a 3-D pocket within their
structures, in which substrate molecules can be held in a
certain orientation to facilitate a reaction. The two models of
enzyme-substrate interaction are lock-and-key and induced fit.
1.
Enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction, do not get
used up in the reaction, catalyze millions of reactions per
second, do not aï¬€ect the overall free-energy change of the
reaction, increase the reaction rate, and do not change the
equilibrium of reactions.
2.
Enzymes can be regulated by inhibitors, molecules that bind to
the enzyme either at the active site or the allosteric (regulatory)
site. Feedback inhibition is when the end product of a
biochemical reaction works to block the activity of the original
enzyme.
