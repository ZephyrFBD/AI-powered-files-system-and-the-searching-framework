As discussed in the “Chemistry and Life” box on the chem-
istry of vision, such transformations can be induced by 
light and are the key to human vision. (a) What is the hy-
bridization at the two central carbon atoms of 2-butene? 
(b) The isomerization occurs by rotation about the cen-
tral C ¬C bond. With reference to Figure 9.29, explain 
why the p bond between the two central carbon atoms is 
destroyed halfway through the rotation from cis- to trans-
2-butene. (c) Based on average bond enthalpies (Table 8.3), 
how much energy per molecule must be supplied to break 
the C ¬ C p bond? (d) What is the longest wavelength of 
light that will provide photons of sufficient energy to break 
the C ¬ C p bond and cause the isomerization? (e) Is the 
wavelength in your answer to part (d) in the visible portion 
of the electromagnetic spectrum? Comment on the impor-
tance of this result for human vision.
