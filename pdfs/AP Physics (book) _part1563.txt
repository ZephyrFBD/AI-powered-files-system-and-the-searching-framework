FIGURE 14;12 (a) Earth’s seasons
arise from the tilt of Earth’s axis
relative to its orbit around the Sun.
(b) June sunlight makes an angle of
about 23 ° with the equator. Thus in
the southern U.S. (label A) is near 0°
(direct summer sunlight), but in the
Southern Hemisphere (B),
is 50° or 60°,
and less heat can be absorbed—hence it
is winter. Near the poles (C), there is
never strong direct sunlight:
varies
from about in summer to 0 in winter;
so with little heating, ice can form.

Heat
Internal energy, U, refers to the total energy of all the molecules
in an object. For an ideal monatomic gas,
