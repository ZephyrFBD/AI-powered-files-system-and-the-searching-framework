 
(expel) from the rear of the 
rockets (labeled 
).
According to Newton’s third 
law, these ejected gases 
exert an equal and opposite 
force on the rockets in the 
forward direction. It is this 
“reaction” force exerted on
the rockets by the gases,
labeled 
that 
accelerates the rockets 
forward.

1. A 150-kg football player collides head-on with a 75-kg running back. During
the collision, the heavier player exerts a force of magnitude

player. If the smaller player exerts a force 
back on the heavier player, which
response is most accurate?
