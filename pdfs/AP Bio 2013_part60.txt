ts DNA at that site, producing 
separate fragments. Which of the following best 
explains the banding patterns exhibited in 
Figure 4 ? 
(A) The HbA DNA contains a recognition site for 
the Mst II restriction enzyme. 
(B) The HbA/HbS DNA contains three 
recognition sites for the Mst II  
restriction endonuclease. 
(C) Individual I has only one copy of the 
hemoglobin gene; therefore there is  
only one band on the gel. 
(D) The HbS/HbA DNA contains three different 
alleles for sickle-cell disease. 
 
51. Possessing a single copy of the HbS allele  
has been shown to provide some resistance to 
infection by Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite 
that causes malaria. Which of the following 
individuals represented in the pedigree would 
have the greatest selective advantage in an area 
where malaria is common? 
(A) I 
(B) II 
(C) III 
(D) V
