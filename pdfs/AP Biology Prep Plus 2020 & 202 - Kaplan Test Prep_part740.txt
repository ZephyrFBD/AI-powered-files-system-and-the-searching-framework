17.2 Explain how to read and test a cladogram
Sample Cladogram
This hypothetical cladogram shows relationships among ten taxa. A
cladogram may or may not show a time scale. Taxon 7 may share a
common ancestor, which isn’t shown on the tree, with taxa 5 and 9. Taxon
7 is not the ancestor of taxa 5 and 9, nor does it necessarily have more
characteristics in common with the ancestral taxon of taxa 7, 5, and 9 than
taxa 5 or 9 do. It could have just as many anagenetic changes
(evolutionary events without speciation) along its branch as
cladogenetic changes (evolutionary events that lead to speciation). Taxon
4 is more closely related to taxa 8, 10, 7, 5, and 9 than it is to taxon 3. Even
though taxon 3 is close to taxon 4 on the tree, it is not on the same branch
that includes taxa 4, 8, 10, 7, 5, and 9. Likewise, taxon 2 is more closely
related to taxon 6 than it is to taxon 1. Taxa 2 and 6 belong to the same
branch that does not incl
