ke plants and fungi and animals and bacteria. Some of these things
compete with the plants, but other things like certain types of fungi and bacteria can help the plant acquire nutrients.
Abiotic things are nonliving, like sunlight and soil, nutrients, water, and atmosphere composition. These things are also
important, especially since plants need appropriate water and sunlight for photosynthesis.
b. Construct a graph of averages and standard error for the western and eastern flowers. (4 points)
1 point—proper axes
1 point—proper size of bars showing mean
1 point—correct labels
1 point—graphing error bars
c. Perform a chi-squared analysis using the average data for both flower types. (3 points)
Using the null hypothesis that the flowers do not prefer the Western side, we would have expected values of equal
numbers living in each place. There were 2,196 flowers total in the average. So, we can expect that there would be
1,098 flowers in each location for the null hypothesis. For the wes
