 concentration 
of lead in the blood was measured to be 1.6 µg/dL in 2008. 
Express this concentration in ppb.
 [18.77]  As of the writing of this text, EPA standards limit atmo-
spheric ozone levels in urban environments to 84 ppb. 
How many moles of ozone would there be in the air above 
Los Angeles County (area about 4000 square miles; con-
sider a height of 100 m above the ground) if ozone was at 
this concentration?

 18.78  The estimated average concentration of NO2 in air in the 
United States in 2006 was 0.016 ppm. (a) Calculate the 
partial pressure of the NO2 in a sample of this air when 
the atmospheric pressure is 755 torr (99.1 kPa). (b) How 
many molecules of NO2 are present under these condi-
tions at 20 °C in a room that measures 15 * 14 * 8 ft?
