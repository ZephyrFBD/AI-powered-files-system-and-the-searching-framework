l weak from the typhoid and I have to sit on steps and hold on to 
 
 walls and I wonder was it something good I said in that composition or 
 
 something bad. 
 
 Mr.Thomas L. O’Halloran teaches three classes in one room, sixth, 
 
 seventh, eighth. He has a head like President Roosevelt and he wears 
 
 gold glasses. He wears suits, navy blue or gray, and there’s a gold watch 
 
 chain that hangs across his belly from pocket to pocket in his waistcoat. 
 
 We call him Hoppy because he has a short leg and hops when he walks. 
 
 He knows what we call him and he says,Yes, I’m Hoppy and I’ll hop on 
 
 you. He carries a long stick, a pointer, and if you don’t pay attention or 
 
 give a stupid answer he gives you three slaps on each hand or whacks 
 
 you across the backs of your legs. He makes you learn everything by 
 
  
  
 heart, everything, and that makes him the hardest master in the school. 
 
 He loves America and makes us know all the American states in alphabetical 
 
 order.
