arding the attempt to
add calcium back to decalcified bones.
Test the hypothesis: Test the prediction by removing calcium from chicken bones by placing them in a jar
of vinegar for seven days. Test the hypothesis regarding adding calcium back to decalcified bone by placing
the decalcified chicken bones into a jar of water with calcium supplements added. Test the prediction by
denaturing the collagen from the bones by baking them at 250°C for three hours.
Analyze the data: Create a table showing the changes in bone flexibility, strength, and mass in the three
different environments.
Report the results: Under which conditions was the bone most flexible? Under which conditions was the
bone the strongest?
Draw a conclusion: Did the results support or refute the hypothesis? How do the results observed in this
experiment correspond to diseases that destroy bone tissue?
