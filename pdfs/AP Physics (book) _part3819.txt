at there are two solutions for x: one where the plus sign 
is used, the other where the minus sign is used.
Find the solutions for x in the equation
APPROACH Here x appears both to the first power and squared, so we use 
the quadratic equation.
SOLUTION First we write this equation in the standard form
by subtracting 2 from both sides:
In this case, a, b, and c in the standard formula take the values
and
The two solutions for x are, using Eq.A–4,
and
In this Example, the two solutions are
and
In physics
problems, it sometimes happens that only one of the solutions corresponds to a
real-life situation; in this case, the other solution is discarded. In other cases,
both solutions may correspond to physical reality.
Notice, incidentally, that 
must be greater than 4ac, so that
yields a real number. If
is less than zero (negative), there is no real
solution. The square root of a negative number is called imaginary.
A second-order equation—one in which the highest power of x is 2—has two
so
