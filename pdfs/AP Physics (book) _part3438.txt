formulas, because 
is not close to the speed of
light c. And 
will be even less because 
Thus we can write the 
of the lithium, using the momentum equation just above, as
We put in numbers,
changing the mass in u to kg and recall that
(b) We are given the data
in Eq. 31–2b, so 
where
Hence,
Will the reaction “go”? Can the reaction
occur when 
is bombarded by 2.0-MeV protons?
APPROACH The reaction will “go” if the reaction is exothermic 
and
even if 
if the input momentum and kinetic energy are sufficient. First 
we calculate Q from the difference between final and initial masses using
Eq. 31–2a, and look up the masses in Appendix B.
SOLUTION The total masses before and after the reaction are:
Before 
After
(We must use the mass of the 
atom rather than that of the bare proton because
the masses of 
and 
include the electrons, and we must include an equal
number of electron masses on each side of the equation.) The products have an
excess mass of
Thus
and the reaction is endothermic. Th
