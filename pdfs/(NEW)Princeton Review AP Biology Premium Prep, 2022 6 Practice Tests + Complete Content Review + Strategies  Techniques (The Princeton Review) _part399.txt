(analogous) traits, often because they have been exposed to similar selective pressures. Examples of convergent
evolution include aardvarks, anteaters, and pangolins. They all have strong, sharp claws and long snouts with sticky
tongues to catch insects, yet they evolved from three completely different mammals.
There are two types of speciation: allopatric speciation and sympatric speciation. Allopatric speciation simply
means that a population becomes separated from the rest of the species by a geographic barrier so that the two
populations canâ€™t interbreed. An example would be a mountain that separates two populations of ants. In time, the
two populations might evolve into different species. If, however, new species form without any geographic barrier,
it is called sympatric speciation. This type of speciation is common in plants. Two species of plants may evolve in
the same area without any geographic barrier. Often plants undergo speciation due to polyploidy, which occurs
when the
