 particular TV station’s signal 
is 
when it arrives at a 33-cm-diameter
satellite TV antenna. (a) Calculate the total energy received
by the antenna during 4.0 hours of viewing this station’s
programs. (b) Estimate the amplitudes of the E and B fields
of the EM wave.
54. What length antenna would be appropriate for a portable
device that could receive satellite TV?
55. A radio station is allowed to broadcast at an average
power not to exceed 25 kW. If an electric field amplitude
of 
is considered to be acceptable for receiving
the radio transmission, estimate how many kilometers away
you might be able to detect this station.

56. The radiation pressure (Section 22–6) created by electro-
magnetic waves might someday be used to power spacecraft
through the use of a“solar sail,”Example 22–6. (a) Assuming
total reflection, what would be the pressure on a solar sail
located at the same distance from the Sun
