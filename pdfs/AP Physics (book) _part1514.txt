FIGURE 14;2 Besides translational
kinetic energy, molecules can have 
(a) rotational kinetic energy, and 
(b) vibrational energy (both kinetic
and potential).
How heat transferred depends on specific heat. (a) How
much heat input is needed to raise the temperature of an empty 20-kg vat made of
iron from 10°C to 90°C? (b) What if the vat is filled with 20 kg of water?
APPROACH We apply Eq. 14–2 to the different materials involved.
SOLUTION (a) Our system is the iron vat alone.
