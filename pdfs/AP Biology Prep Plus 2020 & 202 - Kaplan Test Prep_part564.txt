13. A biochemist studies protein post-translational modification and
protein traï¬€icking in the cell. She is identifying a modification that
allows intrinsic proteins to form stable associations with the cell
plasma membrane. Which of the following post-translational
modifications is most likely to occur on these intrinsic proteins,
and why?
Tyrosine residues will be phosphorylated to facilitate protein
insertion in the membrane.
(A)
Polysaccharide groups will be added to the protein to
increase its polarity.
(B)
Lipid groups will be added to the protein to increase its
hydrophobicity.
(C)
Disulfide bridges will be formed among the proteins to
