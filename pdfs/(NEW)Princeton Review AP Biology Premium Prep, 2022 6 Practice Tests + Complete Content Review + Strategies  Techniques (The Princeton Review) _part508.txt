rate.
Know how to design a study to determine the effect of temperature on cell respiration.
Know the significance of a control using glass beads. A control is a condition held constant during an
experiment. In this case, glass beads are used as a control because they will not consume any oxygen.
LAB 7: MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS
This lab highlights the differences between mitosis and meiosis. In this lab, slides of onion root tips are prepared to
study plant mitosis. The important information and skills to review in this lab include the following:
Mitosis produces two genetically identical cells, while meiosis produces haploid gametes.
Cell division is highly regulated by checkpoints that depend, in part, on complexes of proteins called cyclins
with other proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases. One such example is the mitosis promoting factor (or MPF)
that has its highest concentration during cell division and is thought to usher a cell into mitosis.
Nondisjunction, or the failure of chro
