Br and a 60.0-mL sample of 
0.600 M KBr are mixed. The solution is then heated to evap-
orate water until the total volume is 50.0 mL. How many 
grams of silver nitrate are required to precipitate out silver 
bromide in the final solution?
 4.100 Neurotransmitters are molecules that are released by nerve 
cells to other cells in our bodies, and are needed for muscle 
motion, thinking, feeling, and memory. Dopamine is a com-
mon neurotransmitter in the human brain.
 
 (a) Predict what kind of reaction dopamine is most likely to 
undergo in water: redox, acid-base, precipitation, or metath-
esis? Explain your reasoning. (b) Patients with Parkinsonâ€™s 
disease suffer from a shortage of dopamine and may need to 
take it to reduce symptoms. An IV (intravenous fluid) bag is 
filled with a solution that contains 400.0 mg dopamine per 
250.0 mL of solution. What is the concentration of dopa-
mine in the IV bag in units of molarity? (c) Experiments with 
rats show that if rats are dosed with 3.0
