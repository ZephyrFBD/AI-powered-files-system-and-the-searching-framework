Spontaneous Processes (Section 19.1)
 19.11  Which of the following processes are spontaneous and 
which are nonspontaneous: (a) the ripening of a banana, 
(b) dissolution of sugar in a cup of hot coffee, (c) the reac-
tion of nitrogen atoms to form N2 molecules at 25 °C and 
1 atm, (d) lightning, (e) formation of CH4 and O2 mole-
cules from CO2 and H2O at room temperature and 1 atm of 
pressure?
 19.12  Which of the following processes are spontaneous: 
 
(a) the melting of ice cubes at -10 °C and 1 atm pres-
sure; (b) separating a mixture of N2 and O2 into two sepa-
rate samples, one that is pure N2 and one that is pure O2;  
(c) alignment of iron filings in a magnetic field; (d) the 
reaction of hydrogen gas with oxygen gas to f
