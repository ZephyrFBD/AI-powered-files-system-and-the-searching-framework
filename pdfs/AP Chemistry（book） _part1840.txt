12.2 ∣ Structures of Solids
Crystalline and amorphous Solids
Solids contain large numbers of atoms. For example, a 1-carat diamond has a volume of 
57mm3 and contains 1.0 * 1022 carbon atoms. How can we hope to describe such a large 
collection of atoms? Fortunately, the structures of many solids have patterns that repeat 
over and over in three dimensions. We can visualize the solid as being formed by stacking 
a large number of small, identical structural units, much like a wall can be built by stack-
ing identical bricks.
Solids in which atoms are arranged in an orderly repeating pattern are called crys-
talline solids. These solids usually have flat surfaces, or faces, that make definite angles 
with one another. The orderly arrangements of atoms that produce these faces also 
cause the solids to have highly regular shapes (Figure 12.2). Examples of crystalline solids
