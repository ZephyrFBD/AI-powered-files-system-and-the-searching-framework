al fitness to enhance
the reproductive fitness of a relative and thus one’s inclusive fitness evolves through kin selection. This phenomenon
can explain many superficially altruistic behaviors seen in animals. However, these behaviors may not be truly defined as
altruism in these cases because the actor is actually increasing its own fitness either directly (through its own offspring) or
indirectly (through the inclusive fitness it gains through relatives that share genes with it).
Unrelated individuals may also act altruistically to each other, and this seems to defy the “selfish gene” explanation. An
example of this observed in many monkey species where a monkey will present its back to an unrelated monkey to have that
individual pick the parasites from its fur. After a certain amount of time, the roles are reversed and the first monkey now
grooms the second monkey. Thus, there is reciprocity in the behavior. Both benefit from the interaction and their fitness
is raised more than if
