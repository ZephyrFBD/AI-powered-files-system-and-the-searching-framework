ng the cost of solar 
energy down even further. Solar cells made 
with halide perovskites have been shown to be 
nearly as efficient as single crystal silicon solar 
cells, but can be prepared from inexpensive 
solution methods that differ from the more 
costly and energy-intensive methods used to 
produce silicon solar cells. There are still many 
challenges to be overcome before halide per-
ovskite solar cells are produced commercially, 
but their future looks very promising.

Currently, no therapies have been developed to stop the progres-
sion of prion diseases. However, there are encouraging signs that cer-
tain small molecules could disrupt propagation of the disease. They 
might be able to do this by blocking the interaction between one 
prion protein and another that causes the misfolding to propagate. So 
far, the experimental work has involved studies of mice infected with 
prions. One such molecule, called Anle-138b, is shown in Fig
