velocity is low, the pressure is high. For example, if the pressure in the fluid is
measured at points 1 and 2 of Fig. 10–19, it will be found that the pressure is
lower at point 2, where the velocity is greater, than it is at point 1, where the
velocity is smaller. At first glance, this might seem strange; you might expect that
the greater speed at point 2 would imply a higher pressure. But this cannot be the case:

if the pressure in the fluid at point 2 were higher than at point 1, this higher 
pressure would slow the fluid down, whereas in fact it has sped up in going from
point 1 to point 2. Thus the pressure at point 2 must be less than at point 1, to be
consistent with the fact that the fluid accelerates.
To help clarify any misconceptions, a faster fluid might indeed exert a greater
force bouncing off an obstacle placed in its path. But that is not what we mean 
by the pressure in a fluid. We are examining smooth streamline flow, with
