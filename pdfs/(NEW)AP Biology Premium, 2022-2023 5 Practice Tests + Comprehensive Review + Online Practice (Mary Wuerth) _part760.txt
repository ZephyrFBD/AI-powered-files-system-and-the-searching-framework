se of statistics is important in biology. Here are some of the terms and formulas you should be familiar
with for the AP Biology exam.
Mode, median, and mean are used to describe the central tendency of a data set.
Mode—the most frequently used value in a data set
Median—the middle value of a data set
Mean—the average of a data set; to find the mean, add all of the data points in a data set, and then divide by the
number of members in the data set
Here is another way to define the mean:
n = the number of members in the data set
Range, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean are used to describe the spread of a data set.
Range—the highest value of the data set minus the lowest value of the data set
Standard Deviation*
Standard Error of the Mean*
To construct a 95% confidence interval, start at the mean of the data set. Add two times the standard error of the
mean to find the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval. To find the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval,
