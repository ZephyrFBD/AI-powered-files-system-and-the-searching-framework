an isotonic
solution is applied to a plasmolyzed cell. But again, be aware that the solution is isotonic with the plasmolyzed cell
(not a healthy cell) and the plasmolyzed cell has a lower (more negative) solute potential (more concentrated
solution in the cell) than a healthy cell.
Animal cells do not have a cell wall. As a result, immersing an animal cell in a hypotonic solution will cause the cell
to expand. Unless the cell has a mechanism for removing excess water, the cell will continue to expand until it
breaks apart, a process called lysis.
Third, you design an investigation to determine the concentration of a solution and the water potential of a plant cell.
Although there are various alternative setups for this investigation, the most common one is to provide you with five
sucrose solutions (0.2M, 0.4M, 0.6M, 0.8M, and 1.0M) that are labeled A, B, C, D, and E. You do not know which
of the labeled solutions is which concentration. You are also provided with living cells (potato
