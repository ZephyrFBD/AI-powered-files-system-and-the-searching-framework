TOPIC 6.7
Mutations
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
IST-2
Differences in the expression of genes account for some of the phenotypic 
differences between organisms.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-2.E
Describe the various types of 
mutation.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-2.E.1
Changes in genotype can result in changes in 
phenotype—
a. The function and amount of gene products 
determine the phenotype of organisms.
i. The normal function of the genes and 
gene
