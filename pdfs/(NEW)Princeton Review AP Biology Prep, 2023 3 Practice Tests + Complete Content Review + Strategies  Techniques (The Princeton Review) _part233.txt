ylation) to produce ATP.
An absorption spectrum shows how well a certain pigment absorbs electromagnetic radiation. Light absorbed is
plotted as a function of radiation wavelength. This spectrum is the opposite of an emission spectrum, which gives
information on which wavelengths are emitted by a pigment. The absorption spectrum for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll
b, and carotenoids is on the next page. You can see that chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b absorb blue and red light
quite well but do not absorb light in the green part of the spectrum. Light in the green range of wavelengths is
reflected, and this is why chlorophyll and many plants are green. Carotenoids absorb light on the blue-green end of
the spectrum, but not on the other end. This is why plants rich in carotenoids are yellow, orange, or red.
THE LIGHT REACTIONS
When a leaf captures sunlight, the energy is sent to P680, the reaction center for photosystem II. The activated
electrons are trapped by P680 and passed to a molecule
