and gold(III). Complexes with a coordination number of 6 almost 
always have an octahedral geometry. Even though the octahedron 
can be drawn as a square with one ligand above and another below 
the plane, all six vertices are equivalent.

Common Ligands in 
Coordination Chemistry
The ligand atom that binds to the central metal ion in a coordi-
nation complex is called the donor atom of the ligand. Ligands 
having only one donor atom are called monodentate ligands 
(from the Latin, meaning “one-toothed”). These ligands are able to 
occupy only one site in a coordination sphere. Ligands having two 
donor atoms are bidentate ligands (“two-toothed”), and those 
having three or more donor atoms are polydentate ligands 
(“many-toothed”). In both bidentate and polydentate species, 
the multiple donor atoms can simultaneously bond to the metal 
ion, thereby occupying two or more sites in a coordination sphere. 
Table 23.4 gives examples of all three types of ligands.
