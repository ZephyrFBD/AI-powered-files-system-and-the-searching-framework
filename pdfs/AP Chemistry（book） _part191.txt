 to three decimal places before and after pumping 
out the gas, could the density of the gas then be calculated to 
four significant figures?
In this case each quantity has two decimal places. Thus, the mass 
of the gas, 1.38 g, has two decimal places.
Using the volume given in the question, 1.05 * 103 cm3, and the 
definition of density, we have
 
Density =
mass
volume =
1.38 g
1.05 * 103 cm3
 = 1.31 * 10-3 g>cm3 = 0.00131 g>cm3
In dividing numbers, we determine the number of significant fig-
ures our result should contain by counting the number of signifi-
cant figures in each quantity. There are three significant figures in 
our answer, corresponding to the number of significant figures in 
the two numbers that form the ratio. Notice that in this example, 
following the rules for determining significant figures gives an 
answer containing only three significant figures, even though the 
measured masses contain five significant figures.
