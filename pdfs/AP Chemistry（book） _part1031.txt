“directional” characteristics of the px and dx2 - y2 orbitals. 
(That is, in what  
direction or region of space is the electron 
density concentrated?) (c) What can you say about the aver-
age distance from the nucleus of an electron in a 2s orbital as 
compared with a 3s orbital? (d) For the hydrogen atom, list 
the following orbitals in order of increasing energy (that is, 
most stable ones first): 4f, 6s, 3d, 1s, 2p.
 6.66  (a) With reference to Figure 6.19, what is the relationship 
between the number of nodes in an s orbital and the value 
of the principal quantum number? (b) Identify the number 
of nodes; that is, identify places where the electron density 
is zero, in the 2px orbital; in the 3s orbital. (c) What informa-
tion is obtained from the radial probability functions in Fig-
ure 6.19? (d) For the hydrogen atom, list the following orbit-
als in order of increasing energy: 3s, 2s, 2p, 5s, 4d.
