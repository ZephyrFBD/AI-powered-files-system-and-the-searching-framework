uch a constant temperature that
the fish also have a constant body temperature, just like a homeotherm.
Although mammals are classified as homeotherms, their temperature
sometimes varies greatly. During torpor, estivation, or hibernation,
mammals save energy by drastically decreasing their metabolic rate and
body temperature.
Problems of Living on Land
Through natural selection, animals have evolved various anatomical and
physiological adaptations for life in different environments. The size of the
ears in a jackrabbit can be correlated to the climate in which it lives.
Jackrabbits living in cold, northern regions have small ears to minimize
heat loss. In contrast, rabbits in warm, southern regions have long ears to
dissipate heat from the many capillaries that make their ears appear pink.
This anatomical difference across a geographic range is called a north-
south cline.
Countercurrent heat exchange is a mechanism that has evolved in a
variety of organisms. It helps to warm or cool e
