ate level) phosphorylation 
of ADP 
Formation of a proton gradient by the 
electron transport chain  
• The flow of protons through membrane-bound ATP 
synthase generates ATP 
• Provides energy for (oxidative) phosphorylation of 
ADP

Question 2 (continued) 
 
(b)  Use each of the following observations to justify the claim that glycolysis first occurred in a common 
ancestor of all living organisms. 
• 
Nearly all existing organisms perform glycolysis. 
• 
Glycolysis occurs under anaerobic conditions. 
• 
Glycolysis occurs only in the cytosol. 
 
Observation 
Justification (1 point each box; 3 points maximum) 
Nearly all existing 
organisms perform 
glycolysis 
• Trait/gene/process originated early and was inherited/passed 
down/highly conserved 
• Glycolysis provided a selective advantage that was passed on to 
descendants  
Glycolysis occurs under 
anaerobic
