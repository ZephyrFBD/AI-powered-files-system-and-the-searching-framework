73. You have been hired as an expert witness in a court case
involving an automobile accident. The accident involved
car A of mass 1500 kg which crashed into stationary car B
of mass 1100 kg. The driver of car A applied his brakes
15 m before he skidded and crashed into car B. After the
collision, car A slid 18 m while car B slid 30 m. The coeffi-
cient of kinetic friction between the locked wheels and the
road was measured to be 0.60. Show that the driver of car A
was exceeding the 
speed limit before
applying the brakes.
74. A meteor whose mass was about
struck the
Earth  
with a speed of about 
and came to rest in the Earth. (a) What was the Earthâ€™s
recoil speed (relative to Earth at rest before the collision)?
(b) What fraction of t
