ly). Since the
distance between a node and the nearest antinode is 
we see that the funda-
mental in a closed tube corresponds to only one-fourth of a wavelength within the
length of the tube:
and
The fundamental frequency is thus
or half that for an open pipe of the same length. There is another 
difference, for as we can see from Fig. 12–12a, only the odd harmonics are present
in a closed tube: the overtones have frequencies equal to 
times the 
fundamental frequency. There is no way for waves with 
times the funda-
mental frequency to have a node at one end and an antinode at the other, and
thus they cannot exist as standing waves in a closed tube.
Another way to analyze the vibrations in a uniform tube is to consider a
description in terms of the pressure in the air, shown in part (b) of Figs. 12–11 and
12–12 (right-hand sides). Where the air in a wave is compressed, the pressure is
higher, whereas in a wave expansion (or rarefaction), the pressure is less than normal.
