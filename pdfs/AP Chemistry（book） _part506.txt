13.81% H, and 27.40% N by mass; its molar mass is 
102.2 g>mol.
(c) Epinephrine (adrenaline), a hormone secreted into the 
bloodstream in times of danger or stress, contains 59.0% 
C, 7.1% H, 26.2% O, and 7.7% N by mass; its molar mass

 3.55 (a) Combustion analysis of toluene, a common organic 
solvent, gives 5.86 mg of CO2 and 1.37 mg of H2O. If the 
compound contains only carbon and hydrogen, what is its 
empirical formula? (b) Menthol, the substance we can smell 
in mentholated cough drops, is composed of C, H, and O. A 
0.1005-g sample of menthol is combusted, producing 0.2829 g 
 
of CO2 and 0.1159 g of H2O. What is the empirical formula 
for menthol? If menthol has a molar mass of 156 g>mol, 
what is its molecular formula?
 3.56  (a) The characteristic odor of pineapple is due to ethyl butyr-
ate, a compound containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. 
Combustion of 2.78 mg of ethyl butyrate produces 6.32 mg 
of CO2 and 2.58 mg of H2O. What is the empirical
