When an external magnetic field is applied, the spectral
lines are split (the Zeeman effect), indicating that the energy
depends also on

Even in the absence of a magnetic field, precise measure-
ments of spectral lines show a tiny splitting of the lines called
fine structure, whose explanation is that the energy depends
very slightly on 
and 
Transitions between states that obey the selection rule
are far more probable than other so-called
forbidden transitions.
The arrangement of electrons in multi-electron atoms is
governed by the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no
two electrons can occupy the same quantum state—that is, they
cannot have the same set of quantum numbers n,
and
As a result, electrons in multi-electron atoms are grouped
into shells (according to the value of n) a
