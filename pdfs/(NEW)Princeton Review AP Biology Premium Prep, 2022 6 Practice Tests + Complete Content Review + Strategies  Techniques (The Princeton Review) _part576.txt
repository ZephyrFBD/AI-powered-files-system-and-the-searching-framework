inhibits that process. Choices (A)
and (B) involve stimulations, so they can be eliminated. Choice (C) doesn’t make sense because it says
that “C” is an enzyme and the passage says that the enzymes are the numbers shown between the steps.
6.
D
If substance F leads to the inhibition of enzyme 3, then substances D and E and enzymes 3, 4, and 5 will
be affected. The activity of enzyme 5 will be decreased, not increased.
7.
C
If enzyme 1 were inhibited, then everything that comes after that in the pathway would be reduced.
Substance A would not be reduced, but both C and X would. Choice (C) is correct.
8.
C
Based on the graph, fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than maternal hemoglobin. Fetal
hemoglobin does not give up oxygen more readily than maternal hemoglobin, so eliminate (A). You can
also get rid of (B), as the dissociation curve of fetal hemoglobin is to the left of the maternal hemoglobin.
Finally, eliminate (D) because fetal hemoglobin and maternal hemoglobin are d
