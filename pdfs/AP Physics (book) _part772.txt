ard in an arc. Determine
the vertical and horizontal components of the pendulumâ€™s
maximum displacement.
36. (II) An internal explosion breaks an object, initially at
rest, into two pieces, one of which has 1.5 times the mass of
the other. If 5500 J is released in the explosion, how much
kinetic energy does each piece acquire?
37. (II) A 980-kg sports car collides into the rear end of a 2300-kg
SUV stopped at a red light. The bumpers lock, the brakes
are locked, and the two cars skid forward 2.6 m before stop-
ping. The police officer, estimating the coefficient of kinetic
friction between tires and road to be 0.80, calculates the
speed of the sports car at impact. What was that speed?
38. (II) You drop a 14-g ball from a height of 1.5 m and it only
bounces back to a height of 0.85 m.What was the total impulse
on the ball when it hit the floor? (Ignore air resistance.)
39. (II) Car A hits car B (initially at rest and of equal mass)
from behind while going 
Immediately after the colli-
