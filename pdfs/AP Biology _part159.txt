experiment?
As the chromosomes moved poleward, the microtubule
shortened at the chromosome end.
As the chromosomes moved poleward, the spindle shortened at
the pole side.
As the chromosomes moved poleward, the spindle shortened at
both the chromosome and pole end.
As the chromosomes moved poleward, the spindle lengthened
at the pole end.
After analyzing the results of this experiment, which of the
following theories is best supported by the evidence presented and
provides the correct reasoning for that theory?
Chromosomes are passively pulled along the spindle fibers
because the chromosome end of the spindle is shortened.
Chromosomes are passively pulled along the spindle fibers
because the pole end of the spindle is shortened.
Chromosomes “walk” along the spindle fibers as the spindle
disassembles at the kinetochore end because the kinetochore
end is shortened.
Chromosomes “walk” along the spindle fibers as the spindle
disassembles at the kinetochore end because the pole end is
