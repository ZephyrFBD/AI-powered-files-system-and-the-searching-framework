e the developmental wiring malfunctions that caused their disorders also put them at
risk for epilepsy. For many patients, however, the cause of their epilepsy is never identified and is likely to be a combination
of genetic and environmental factors. Often, seizures can be controlled with anticonvulsant medications. However, for very
severe cases, patients may undergo brain surgery to remove the brain area where seizures originate.
Stroke
A stroke results when blood fails to reach a portion of the brain for a long enough time to cause damage. Without
the oxygen supplied by blood flow, neurons in this brain region die. This neuronal death can cause many different
symptoms—depending on the brain area affected— including headache, muscle weakness or paralysis, speech disturbances,
sensory problems, memory loss, and confusion. Stroke is often caused by blood clots and can also be caused by the bursting
of a weak blood vessel. Strokes are extremely common and are the third most common caus
