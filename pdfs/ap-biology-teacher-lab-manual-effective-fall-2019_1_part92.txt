tributions; a concave upward curve is associated with 
exponentially increasing functions, such as occur in the early stages of bacterial growth; 
an S-shaped curve is associated with a carrying capacity of the environment (a logistic 
curve); and a sine-wave-like curve (see Figure 4) is associated with a biological rhythm. 
Such shapes are quite familiar to a biologist, and with more frequent exposures, your 
students will become familiar with these shapes and their biological implications.

Mapping is an extremely important tool in biology â€” from localization of organelles 
in a cell to world mapping of biodiversity. Some of the easily ad
