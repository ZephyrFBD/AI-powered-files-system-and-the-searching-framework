rface of each rotating disk or platter,
Fig. 21–27a. During recording of an audio or video signal on tape, or “writing”
on a hard drive, the voltage is sent to the recording head which acts as a tiny
electromagnet (Fig. 21–27b) that magnetizes the tiny section of tape or disk pass-
ing the narrow gap in the head at each instant. During playback, or “reading” of
an HD, the changing magnetism of the moving tape or disk at the gap causes
corresponding changes in the magnetic field within the soft-iron head, which in
turn induces an emf in the coil (Faraday’s law). This induced emf is the output
signal that can be processed by the computer, or for audio can be amplified and
sent to a loudspeaker (for video to a monitor or TV).

Audio and video signals may be analog, varying continuously in amplitude over
time: the variation in degree of magnetization at sequential points reflects the varia-
tion in amplitude and frequency of the audio or video signal. In modern equipment,
analog signals
