cking them.
Predict the effect this would have on the cell signaling pathway that involves acetylcholine.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
5. A student performs a bacterial transformation experiment. Wild-type E. coli are transformed with a plasmid
containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. The GFP gene is attached to the control elements of the
repressible tryptophan operon. A diagram of the plasmid is shown in the figure.
(a) Describe the roles of the promoter and operator in operons.
(b) Explain the effect, if any, of adding tryptophan to the medium in which the transformed bacteria are
growing.
(c) Tryptophan is added to the medium in which the bacteria are growing. Using an “X” for tryptophan and an
“O” for the repressor protein, represent the likely locations of tryptophan and the repressor protein on or
around the operon in the figure above.
(d) Explain how the regulation of the expression of the tryptophan operon relates to negative feedback.
