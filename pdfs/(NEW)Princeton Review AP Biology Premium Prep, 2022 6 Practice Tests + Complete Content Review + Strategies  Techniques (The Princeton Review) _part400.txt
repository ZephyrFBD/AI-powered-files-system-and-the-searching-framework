POPULATION GENETICS
Mendel’s laws can extend to the population level. Suppose you caught a bunch of fruit flies—about 1,000. Let’s say
that 910 of them were red-eyed and 90 were green-eyed. If you allowed the fruit flies to mate and counted the next
generation, we’d see that the ratio of red-eyed to green-eyed fruit flies would remain approximately the same: 91
percent red-eyed and 9 percent green-eyed. That is, the allele frequency would remain constant. At first glance you
may ask, how could that happen?
Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
The Hardy-Weinberg law states that even with all the shuffling of genes that goes on, the relative frequencies of
genotypes in a population are constant over time. Alleles don’t get lost in the shuffle. The dominant gene doesn’t
become more prevalent, and the recessive gene doesn’t disappear.
This law says that a population will be in genetic equilibrium only if it meets these five conditions: (1) a large
population, (2)
