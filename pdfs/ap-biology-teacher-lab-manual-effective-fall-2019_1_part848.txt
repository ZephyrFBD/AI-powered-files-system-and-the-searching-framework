ively, the experimenter 
could play it safe and draw only a bar graph for these spaced temperatures. Another 
useful dodge would be to connect the points with a smooth but broken line rather than 
a continuous line. As always, the broken line would suggest the tentative and provisional 
nature of the curve as drawn.
