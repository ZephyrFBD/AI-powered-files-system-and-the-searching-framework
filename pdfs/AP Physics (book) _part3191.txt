he film to record both the intensity and relative phase of the light
at each point. It is crucial that the incident light be coherent—that is, in phase at
all points—which is why a laser is used. After the film is developed, it is placed
again in a laser beam and a three-dimensional image of the object is created. You
can walk around such an image and see it from different sides as if it were the
original object. Yet, if you try to touch it with your hand, there will be nothing
material there.

CHAPTER 28
Quantum Mechanics of Atoms
In 1925, Schrödinger and Heisenberg separately worked out a
new theory, quantum mechanics, which is now considered to
be the fundamental theory at the atomic level. It is a statistical
theory rather than a deterministic one.
An important aspect of quantum mechanics is the Heisen-
berg uncertainty principle. It results from the wave–p
