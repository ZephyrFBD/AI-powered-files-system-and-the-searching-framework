2.2.3 Model process
The model can be divided into the following three stages:
(1) The stage of adding water: the time from adding water to stopping adding water,
which is as long as 1
t ;
(2) The stage of fusion: the time from stopping adding water to the temperature of the
water in the bathtub becoming even, which is as long as 2
t ;
(3) The stage of becoming cool: the time from the temperature of the water in the
bathtub becoming even to the temperature of the water in the bathtub getting as cool
