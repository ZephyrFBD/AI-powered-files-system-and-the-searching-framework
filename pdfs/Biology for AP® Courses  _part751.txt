rocesses. Cellulose is broken down
into simpler compounds during physical activity.
The simpler compounds are then used to provide
energy to the muscles for contraction by
anabolic pathways.
31. How do chemical reactions play a role in energy
transfer?
a.
Energy from the breakdown of glucose and other
molecules in animals is released as ATP, which
transfer energy to other reactions.
b.
Energy from the breakdown of glucose and other
molecules in animals is released in the form of
NADP, which transfers energy to other reactions.
c.
Energy is released in the form of glucose from
the breakdown of ATP molecules. These ATP
molecules transfer energy from one reaction to
other.
d.
Energy is released in the form of water from the
breakdown of glucose. These molecules transfer
energy from one reaction to other.
32. Name two different cellular functions that require
energy.
a.
Phagocytosis helps amoebae take up nutrients
and pseudopodia help the amoebae move.
b.
Phagocytosis allows amoebae to mov
