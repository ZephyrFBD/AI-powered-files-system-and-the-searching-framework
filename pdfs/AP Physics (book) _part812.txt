Rolling without slipping involves both rotation and translation. There is a simple
relation between the linear speed v of the axle and the angular velocity 
of the
rotating wheel or sphere: namely,
(where r is the radius) as we now show.
v = rv
v
Centrifuge acceleration. A centrifuge rotor is accelerated
for 30 s from rest to 20,000 rpm (revolutions per minute). (a) What is its average
angular acceleration? (b) Through how many revolutions has the centrifuge rotor
turned during its acceleration period, assuming constant angular acceleration?
APPROACH To determine 
we need the initial and final angular
velocities. For (b), we use Eqs. 8–9 (recall that one revolution corresponds to
).
SOLUTION (a) The initial angular velocity is 
The final angular velocity is
Then, since 
and 
we have
That is, every second the rotor’s angular velocity increases by 
or by
revolutions per second.
(b) To find we could use either Eq. 8–9b or 8–9c (or both to check our answer).
The former gives
where we hav
