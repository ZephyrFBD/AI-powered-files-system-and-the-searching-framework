as and then share them with other 
groups; or as a whole-class discussion to assess studentsâ€™ understanding of key concepts 
pertaining to transpiration in plants: 
1. If a plant cell has a lower water potential than its surrounding environment, make a 
prediction about the movement of water across the cell membrane. In other words, 
will the cell gain water or lose water? Explain your answer in the form of a diagram 
with annotation. 
2. In the winter, salt is sometimes spread over icy roads. In the spring, after the ice has 
melted, grass often dies near these roads. What causes this to happen? Explain your 
answer in the form of a diagram with annotations. 
3. Prepare a thin section of stem from your plant, and then examine it under the 
microscope to identify the vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) and the structural 
differences in their cells. Describe how the observed differences in cellular structure 
reflect differences in function of the two types of vascular tissue.
