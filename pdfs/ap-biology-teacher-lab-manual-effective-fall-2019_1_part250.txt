 ALIGNMENT TO THE AP BIOLOGY CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK
■
This investigation can be conducted while covering concepts pertaining to evolution (big 
idea 1) and/or genetics and information transfer (big idea 3). As always, it is important 
to make connections between big ideas and enduring understandings, regardless 
of where in the curriculum the lab is taught. The concepts align with the enduring 
understandings and learning objectives from the AP Biology Curriculum Framework, as 
indicated below.
