 does this compare to the emf you 
calculated in part (b)?
 20.76  Mercuric oxide dry-cell batteries are often used where a 
flat discharge voltage and long life are required, such as 
in watches and cameras. The two half-cell reactions that 
occur in the battery are
HgO1s2 + H2O1l2 + 2 e- ¡ Hg1l2 + 2 OH-1aq2
Zn1s2 + 2 OH-1aq2 ¡ ZnO1s2 + H2O1l2 + 2 e-
(a) Write the overall cell reaction. (b) The value of E°
red for 
the cathode reaction is +0.098 V. The overall cell potential 
is +1.35 V. Assuming that both half-cells operate under 
standard conditions, what is the standard reduction poten-
tial for the anode reaction? (c) Why is the potential of the 
anode reaction different than would be expected if the reac-
tion occurred in an acidic medium?
 20.77  (a) Suppose that an alkaline battery was manufactured 
using cadmium metal rather than zinc. What effect would 
this have on the cell emf? (b) What environmental advan-
tage is provided by the use of nickel–metal hydride batter-
