 J2>16.626 * 10−34 J@s2 = 3.02 * 1015 s−1
Finally, we use the frequency to determine the wavelength.
l = c>n = 12.998 * 108 m>s2>13.02 * 1015 s-12
= 9.72 * 10-8 m = 97.2 nm
Light with this wavelength falls in the ultraviolet region of the 
electromagnetic spectrum.

CHAPTER 6 Electronic Structure of Atoms
Limitations of the Bohr Model
Although the Bohr model explains the line spectrum of the hydrogen atom, it can not 
explain the spectra of other atoms, except in a crude way. Bohr also avoided the problem 
of why the negatively charged electron would not just fall into the positively charged 
nucleus, by simply assuming it would not happen. Furthermore, we will see that Bohr’s 
model of an electron orbiting the nucleus at a fixed distance is not a realistic picture. 
As we will see in Section 6.4, the electron exhibits wave-like properties, a fact that any 
acceptable model of electronic structure must accommodate.
As it turns out, the Bohr model was only an important ste
