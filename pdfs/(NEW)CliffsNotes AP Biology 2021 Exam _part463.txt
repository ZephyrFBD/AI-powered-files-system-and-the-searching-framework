live in a wide range of habitats and use varied methods of obtaining energy. Some of the more important groups of
bacteria follow:
1. Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic, using chlorophyll a to capture light
 
energy, using CO2, splitting H2O, and releasing O2 as do plants. Some
 
cyanobacteria also fix inorganic nitrogen and convert it into ammonia
 
(NH3), which can then be used for making nitrogen-containing amino
 
acids and nucleotides.
 
2. Purple sulfur bacteria are photosynthetic but split H2S (instead of
 
H2O) to obtain electrons and H+ for noncyclic photophosphorylation,
 
producing sulfur (S). This contrasts with cyanobacteria and plants,
 
where H2O is split to obtain electrons and H+, producing O2.
 
3. Chemoautotrophs (chemolithoautotrophs) are autotrophs that obtain energy from inorganic sources. Some of
these are nitrifying bacteria
 
because they convert nitrite (NO2−) to nitrate (NO3−).
 
4. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria convert N2 to NH3 through intensive
energy-consuming
