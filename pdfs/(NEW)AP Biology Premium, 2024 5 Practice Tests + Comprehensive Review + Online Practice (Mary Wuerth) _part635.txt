rther research revealed that the light-absorbing pigment in the algae Spirogyra (that was used in this
experiment) was chlorophyll, which absorbs the most light energy in the wavelength ranges of 420–470 nm
and 660–700 nm. Some photosynthetic red algae use the pigment phycoerythrin, which absorbs the most light
energy in the wavelength range of 495–570 nm. If this experiment was repeated with photosynthetic red algae,
near which color of light on the slide would you expect to see the greatest number of bacteria?
(A) violet
(B) green
(C) orange
(D) red
18. What is the role of light energy in photosynthesis?
(A) to activate the expression of genes needed for photosynthesis
(B) to trigger a cell signaling pathway that produces carbon dioxide
(C) to excite the electrons in the photosystems
(D) to fix carbon dioxide during the Krebs (citric acid) cycle
