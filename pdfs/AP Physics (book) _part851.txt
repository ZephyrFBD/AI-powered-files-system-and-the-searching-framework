n be written as 
can also be written in
terms of angular momentum:
(8;19)
where 
is the net torque acting to rotate the object, and 
is the change in
angular momentum in a time interval 
Equation 8–14,
is a special
case of Eq. 8–19 when the moment of inertia is constant. This can be seen as 
follows. If an object has angular velocity 
at time 
and angular velocity 
after a time interval 
then its angular acceleration (Eq. 8–3) is
Then from Eq. 8–19, we have
which is Eq. 8–14.
Angular momentum is an important concept in physics because, under 
certain conditions, it is a conserved quantity. We can see from Eq. 8–19 that if 
the net torque 
on an object is zero, then 
equals zero. That is,
so L does not change. This is the law of conservation of angular momentum for
a rotating object:
The total angular momentum of a rotating object remains constant if the net
torque acting on it is zero.
The law of conservation of angular momentum is one of the great conservation
laws of physics, along w
