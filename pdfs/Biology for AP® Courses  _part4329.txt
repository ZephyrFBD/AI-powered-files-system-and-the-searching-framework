lations based on their genetic variability,
and thus their potential to adapt to the environment. Alternatively, a member of a population with low population density
(more spread out in the habitat), might have more difficulty finding a mate to reproduce compared to a population of higher
density. As is shown in Figure 36.2, smaller organisms tend to be more densely distributed than larger organisms.
Figure 36.2 Australian mammals show a typical inverse relationship between population density and body size.
Population Research Methods
The most accurate way to determine population size is to simply count all of the individuals within the habitat. However, this
method is often not logistically or economically feasible, especially when studying large habitats. Thus, scientists usually
study populations by sampling a representative portion of each habitat and using this data to make inferences about the
habitat as a whole. A variety of methods can be used to sample populations to determine
