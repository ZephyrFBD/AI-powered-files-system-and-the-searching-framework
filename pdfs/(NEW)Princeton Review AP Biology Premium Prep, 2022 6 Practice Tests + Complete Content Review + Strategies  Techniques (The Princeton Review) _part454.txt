 spring rains trigger an expansion of species at levels of the food chain. Runoff from
nearby hills brings nutrients which, when combined with warming temperatures, trigger an algae bloom. The
populations of small protozoans such as plankton expand by ingesting the algae. These plankton, subsequently,
are consumed by small crustaceans such as crayfish, which ultimately become prey for fish such as catfish or
carp. In this ecosystem, which of the following accurately describes the crayfish?
(A) They are producers.
(B) They are primary consumers.
(C) They are secondary consumers.
(D) They are tertiary consumers.
Questions 4â€“6 refer to the following table, chart, and paragraph.
Over the period of 1980 to 2000, the average pH in Richard Creek changed drastically. An ecological survey was
performed to evaluate the effect of detectable decreases in pH on the aquatic life of the creek. Four times a year,
