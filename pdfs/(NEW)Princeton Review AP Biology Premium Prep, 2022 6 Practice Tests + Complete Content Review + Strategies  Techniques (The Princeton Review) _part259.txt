t of an organism in response to a stimulus and can be positive (toward the stimulus) or
negative (away from the stimulus). Taxes are innate behavioral responses, or instincts. Chemotaxis is movement in
response to chemicals. For example, bacteria can control flagella rotation to direct their motion, thus avoiding
repellents (such as poisons), or helping them find favorable locations with high concentrations of attractants (such as
food). In our bodies, neutrophils use chemotaxis to respond to an infection and are the first responders to
inflammation.
The cells of multicelled organisms must communicate with one another to coordinate the activities of the organism
as a whole. Signaling can be short-range (affecting only nearby cells) or long-range (affecting cells throughout the
organism). It can be done by cell junctions or signaling molecules called ligands that bind to receptors and trigger a
response. Hormones and neurotransmitters are common signaling molecules.
