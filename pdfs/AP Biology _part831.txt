accidentally affect your results. To avoid this, place a heat sink—a clear
glass beaker containing water—between the light source and the
experimental container. Since the water has a high specific heat, it absorbs
all the heat from the light source.
By using this simple setup, you can study many different variables and
how each affects the rate of photosynthesis. Examples of these variables
include different light intensities, different wavelengths of light, and
different types of plants.
LAB #6: CELL RESPIRATION
Introduction
Cell respiration is the process by which living cells produce energy by the
oxidation of glucose with the formation of the waste products CO2 and
H2O2. Here is the equation for cellular respiration:
C6H12O6+6O2→6CO2+6H2O + 686 kcal of energymole of glucose oxidiz
The rate of cell respiration can be measured by the volume of oxygen used.
The cells used to study respiration in this experiment are sprouted sweet
pea seeds, and the control cons
