 identical to that of the parent cell. Because changes in genes drive both the unity and diversity of
life, organisms without genetic variation cannot evolve through natural selection. Evolution occurs only because organisms
have developed ways to vary their genetic material. This occurs through mutations in DNA, recombination of genes during
meiosis, and meiosis followed by fertilization in sexually reproducing organisms.
Sexual reproduction requires that diploid (2n) organisms produce haploid (1n) cells through meiosis and that these haploid
cells fuse to form new, diploid offspring. The union of these two haploid cells, one from each parent, is fertilization.
Although the processes of meiosis and mitosis share similarities, their end products are different. Recall that eukaryotic
DNA is contained in chromosomes, and that chromosomes occur in homologous pairs (homologues). At fertilization, the
male parent contributes one member of each homologous pair to the offspring, and the femal
