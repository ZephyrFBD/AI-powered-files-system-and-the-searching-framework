AMINO 
ACIDS 
FROM 
THE
CYTOPLASMIC POOL OF AMINO ACIDS TO mRNA AT THE RIBOSOME:
tRNA is shaped like a cloverleaf and has a binding site for an
amino acid at one end and another binding site for an anticodon
sequence that binds to mRNA at the other. See Figure 9.6.
Figure 9.6 Transfer RNA (tRNA)
Transcription consists of three stages: initiation, elongation, and
termination.
Initiation begins when an enzyme, RNA polymerase, recognizes
and binds to DNA at the promoter region. The promoter “tells”
RNA polymerase where to begin transcription and which of the two
strands to transcribe. A collection of proteins called transcription
factors recognize a key area within the promoter, the TATA box
(because of its many repeating thymine and adenine nucleotides),
and mediate the binding of RNA polymerase to the DNA. The
