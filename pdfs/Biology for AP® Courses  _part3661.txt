dy cells need more oxygen or are
experiencing a buildup of carbon dioxide. How would the
body likely respond if some of its cells were experiencing
the situation pictured?
a.
Generating neural signals that stimulate the heart
to beat at a faster rate.
b.
Releasing hormones that stimulate body cells to
undergo more active transport.
c.
Releasing red blood cells that can accept oxygen
using diffusion as opposed to facilitated passive
transport.
d.
Adjust blood pH to decrease the partial pressure
of CO2 in the body cells.

The diagram shows a red blood cell in an alveolus and
then in a body tissue. In which direction should the arrows
point for the diffusion of oxygen and CO2? How should
each partial pressure (body cell and RBC) be labeled as
“high” or “low” to accomplish this diffusion?
a.
O2→ CO2←; Body cell PO2= low; RBC PO2=
high; Body cell PCO2= high, RBC PCO2=
