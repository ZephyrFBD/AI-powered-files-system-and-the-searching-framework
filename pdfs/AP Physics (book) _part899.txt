74. (III) Suppose a 65-kg person stands at the edge of a 5.5-m
diameter merry-go-round turntable that is mounted on
frictionless bearings and has a moment of inertia of
The turntable is at rest initially, but when the
person begins running at a speed of 
(with respect
to the turntable) around its edge, the turntable begins to
rotate in the opposite direction. Calculate the angular
velocity of the turntable.

molecule. The 
bond
length is 0.096 nm and the 
bonds make an
angle of 104°. Calculate the moment of inertia of the 
molecule (assume the atoms are points) about an
axis passing through the center of the oxygen
atom (a) perpendicular to the plane of the 
molecule, and (b) in the plane of the molecule,
