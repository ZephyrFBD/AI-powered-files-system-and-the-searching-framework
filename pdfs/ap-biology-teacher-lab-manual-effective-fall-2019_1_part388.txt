op the following skills: 
•  Assembling and using microrespirometers or gas pressure sensors with computer 
interface 
•  Measuring/calculating rates of cellular respiration 
■ Potential Challenges 
Students often come to biology with the misconception that plants undergo 
photosynthesis (only) and animals undergo cellular respiration. Students are surprised 
to learn that most plant cells possess mitochondria and respire. The Procedures section, 
in which students measure the rate of respiration in germinating seeds, dispels the 
misconception. 
If students have a solid understanding of the aforementioned concepts, they should be 
able to pose scientific questions about cellular respiration and design an experiment(s) 
around the effects of variables on the rate of respiration. The skills and concepts may be 
taught through a variety of methods in an open-inquiry investigation, and respiration 
rates may be measured by several means. Only two methods (microrespirometers or 
gas pressu
