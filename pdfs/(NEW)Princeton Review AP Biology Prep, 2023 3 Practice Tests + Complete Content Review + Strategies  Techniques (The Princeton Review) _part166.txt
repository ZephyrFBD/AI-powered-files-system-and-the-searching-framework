 has a carboxyl group (just like we saw in an amino acid).
A fatty acid can be saturated with hydrogens along its long carbon chain or it can have a few gaps where double
bonds exist instead of a hydrogen. If there is a double bond in the chain, then it is an unsaturated fatty acid. A
polyunsaturated fatty acid has many double bonds within the fatty acid.
Make the Connection
Amino acids have carboxyl groups and fatty acids have carboxyl groups.
Carboxyl groups are acidic; hence they both have acid in their name.
Lipid Saturation
The extent of saturation in a lipid can affect its structure and function. The more double bonds that exist within a
lipid, the more unsaturated it is:
Notice the difference above between the saturated and unsaturated fatty acid. In general, saturated fatty acids are
relatively linear molecules, whereas unsaturated fatty acids with cis-double bonds, as above, are more kinked in their
structure. When molecules are linear, they are more easily able to stack toget
