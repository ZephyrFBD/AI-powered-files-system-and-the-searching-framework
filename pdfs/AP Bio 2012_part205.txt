udent then validates his or her choice of the data by  
stating that the biological species concept supports these 
data. The student may also be able to identify that when 
comparing the DNA or conserved proteins, a sufficient 
number of similarities between the two plant species may 
justify that the two populations may be the same species.
Characteristics of a 
GOOD Response 
The student is able to describe two kinds of data but may 
be able to justify the selection of only one as answering 
the question of whether the two populations are the same 
species. Such an answer would indicate understanding of the 
biological definition of species.
Characteristics of a 
WEAK Response 
The student may be able to describe two kinds of data 
without justification, or may be able to correctly describe 
and justify only one kind of data. This student would 
indicate limited knowledge of the biological definition of  
a species.
