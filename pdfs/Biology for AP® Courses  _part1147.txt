3.8 The student can describe the events that occur in the cell cycle.
The length of the cell cycle is highly variable, even within the cells of a single organism. In humans, the frequency of cell
turnover ranges from a few hours in early embryonic development, to an average of two to five days for epithelial cells, and
to an entire human lifetime spent in G0 by specialized cells, such as cortical neurons or cardiac muscle cells. There is also
variation in the time that a cell spends in each phase of the cell cycle. When fast-dividing mammalian cells are grown in
culture (outside the body under optimal growing conditions), the length of the cycle is about 24 hours. In rapidly dividing
human cells with a 24-hour cell cycle, the G1 phase lasts approximately nine hours, the S phase lasts 10 hours, the G2 phase
lasts about four and one-half hours, an
