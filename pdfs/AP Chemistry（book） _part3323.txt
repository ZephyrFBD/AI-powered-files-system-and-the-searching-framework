onnected to an electrode of an electro-
lytic cell. Is the electrode the anode or the cathode of the 
cell? Explain. (c) The electrolysis of water is often done with 
a small amount of sulfuric acid added to the water. What is 
the role of the sulfuric acid? (d) Why are active metals such 
as Al obtained by electrolysis using molten salts rather than 
aqueous solutions?

7.60 A. What mass of Cr(s) is plated out after 2.00 days? 
 
(b) What amperage is required to plate out 0.250 mol Cr 
from a Cr3+ solution in a period of 8.00 h?

molten MgCl2. (a) What mass of Mg is formed by passing 
a current of 4.55 A through molten MgCl2, for 4.50 days? 
(b) How many minutes are needed to plate out 25.00 g Mg 
from molten MgCl2 using 3.50 A of current?
