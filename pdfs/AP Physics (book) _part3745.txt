ng. The farther an object is from us,
the longer ago the light we see had to have left it. We cannot
see quite as far as the Big Bang; we can see only as far as the
“surface of last scattering,” which radiated the CMB. The
insert on the lower right shows the earliest 380,000 years of
the universe when it was opaque: a photon is shown
scattering many times and then (at decoupling, 380,000 yr
after the birth of the universe) becoming free to travel in
a straight line. If this photon wasn’t heading our way when
“liberated,” many others were. Galaxies are not shown, but
would be concentrated close to Earth in this diagram because
they were created relatively recently. Note: This diagram is
not a normal map. Maps show a section of the world as might
be seen all at a given time. This diagram shows space (like a
map), but each point is not at the same time. The light coming
from a point a distance r from Earth took a time
to reach Earth, and thus shows an event that took place long
ago, a tim
