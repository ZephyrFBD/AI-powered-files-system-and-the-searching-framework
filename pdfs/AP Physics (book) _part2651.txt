Index of refraction 
as a function of 
wavelength for 
various transparent 
solids.
Light with wavelength (in air) shorter than 
is called ultraviolet
(UV), and light with wavelength longer than 
is called infrared
(IR).† Although human eyes are not sensitive to UV or IR, some types of photo-
graphic film and other detectors do respond to them.
A prism can separate white light into a rainbow of colors, as shown in Fig.24–13.
This happens when the index of refraction of a material depends on the wavelength,
as shown for several materials in Fig. 24–14. White light is a mixture of all visible
wavelengths, and when incident on a prism, as in Fig. 24–15, the different wave-
lengths are bent to varying degrees. Because the index of refraction is
