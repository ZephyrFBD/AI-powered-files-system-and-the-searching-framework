 uncoordinated catabolic and anabolic
reactions that wastes some of the energy that is
stored.
c.
Metabolic pathways are economical due to the
presence of anaplerotic reactions that replenish
the intermediates.
d.
Metabolic pathways are wasteful as most of the
energy produced is utilized in maintaining the
reduced environment of the cytosol.
39. What lipids are connected to glucose catabolism
pathways and how are they connected?
a.
Cholesterol and triglycerides can be converted to
glycerol-3-phosphate that continues through
glycolysis.
b.
Glucagon and glycogen can be converted to
3-phosphoglyceraldehyde that is an intermediate
of glycolysis.
c.
Chylomicrons and fatty acids get converted to
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate that continues in
glycolysis, forming pyruvate.
d.
Sphingolipids and triglycerides form glucagon
that can be fed into glycolysis.
40. How does citrate from the citric acid cycle affect
glycolysis?
a.
Citrate and ATP are negative regulators of
phosphofructokinase-1.
b.
Citrate
