s may provide shelters for the birds and the
birds spread seeds which will eventually develop into a food source for the rodents as well. This describes a mutualistic
behavior, or the relationship could be commensalistic where the birds benefit but the rodents do not benefit from the
birds.
c. Protein HITB8 is found to be present in high levels in medium-sized beak finches and less so in other finch
types. Predict what will happen to the frequency of this protein product in the finch population after two
generations if the drought continues.
The protein HITB8 will decrease in abundance.
d. Justify your answer to (c).
A drought will make surviving on the island more difficult due to the birdsâ€™ decreased ability to find the food with
their beak type. As such, the frequency of the gene encoding the HITB8 protein will be less plentiful and the protein will
be expressed in lower numbers.
