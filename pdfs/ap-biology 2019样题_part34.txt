onment. Organisms respond to 
changes in their environment at the molecular, cellular, physiological, and 
behavioral levels. Living systems require energy and matter to maintain 
order, grow, and reproduce. Organisms employ various strategies 
to capture, use, and store energy and other vital resources. Energy 
deficiencies are not only detrimental to individual organisms but they can 
cause disruptions at the population and ecosystem levels. Homeostatic 
mechanisms that are conserved or divergent across related organisms 
reflect either continuity due to common ancestry or evolutionary change in 
response to distinct selective pressures.
BIG IDEA 3: INFORMATION STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION (IST)
Living systems store, retrieve, transmit, and respond to information 
essential to life processes. Genetic information provides for continuity 
of life, and, in most cases, this information is passed from parent to 
offspring via DNA. Nonheritable information transmission influences 
behavior wit
