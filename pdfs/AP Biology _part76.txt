membrane.
ENE-2 & SYI-1
Internal membranes facilitate cell processes by minimizing competing interactions and
by increasing surface area where reactions can occur.
Nucleus
The nucleus contains chromosomes that are wrapped with special proteins
into a chromatin network. The nucleus is surrounded by a selectively
permeable nuclear envelope that separates the contents of the nucleus
from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope contains pores to allow for the
transport of molecules, like messenger RNA (mRNA), which are too large
to diffuse directly through the envelope. (See Figure 9.14.)
Endoplasmic Reticulum
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a membranous system of channels and

the total membranes in a eukaryotic cell. There are two types:
