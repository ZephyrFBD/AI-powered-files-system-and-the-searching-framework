25. What would happen if the 5’ methyl guanosine was not
added to an mRNA?
a.
The transcript would degrade when the mRNA
moves out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
b.
The mRNA molecule would stabilize and start
the process of translation within the nucleus of
the cell.
c.
The mRNA molecule would move out of the
nucleus and create more copies of the mRNA
molecule.
d.
The mRNA molecule would not be able to add
the poly-A tail on its strand at the 5’ end.
26. Which of the following is associated with the docking

CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
27. If mRNA is complementary to the DNA template
strand and the DNA template stand is complementary to
the DNA non-template strand, why are base sequences of
mRNA and the DNA non-template strand not id
