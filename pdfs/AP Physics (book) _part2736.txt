CHAPTER 24
The Wave Nature of Light
7. (II) Light of wavelength 680 nm falls on two slits and 
produces an interference pattern in which the third-order
bright red fringe is 38 mm from the central fringe on a screen
2.8 m away. What is the separation of the two slits?
8. (II) Light of wavelength 
passes through a pair of slits
separated by 0.17 mm, forming a double-slit interference
pattern on a screen located a distance 37 cm away.
Suppose that the image in Fig. 24–9a is an actual-size
reproduction of this interference pattern. Use a ruler to
measure a pertinent distance on this image; then utilize
this measured value to determine 
9. (II) A parallel beam of light from a He–Ne laser, with a
wavelength 633 nm, falls on two very narrow slits 0.068 mm
apart. How f
