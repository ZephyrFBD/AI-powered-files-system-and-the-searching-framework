create molecules, which in turn combine to form
cells, tissues, organ systems, and organisms. Atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons, are the smallest
units of an element that retain all of the properties of that element. Electrons can be transferred, shared, or cause charge
disparities between atoms to create bonds, including ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds, as well as van der Waals
interactions.
2.2 Water
Water has many properties that are critical to maintaining life. It is a polar molecule, allowing for the formation of
hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds allow ions and other polar molecules to dissolve in water. Therefore, water is an
excellent solvent. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules cause the water to have a high heat capacity, meaning it
