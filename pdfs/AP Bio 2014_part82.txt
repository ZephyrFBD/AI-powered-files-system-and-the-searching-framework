 
advantageous mutations. 
(C) Eukaryotes have mitochondria and 
chloroplasts that contain their own genome, 
which allows the cells to reproduce more 
rapidly. 
(D) Eukaryotes have organelles that allow for 
compartmentalization of cellular processes, 
which increases the efficiency of those 
processes.   
50. Gregor Mendelâ€™s pioneering genetic experiments 
with pea plants occurred before the discovery of 
the structure and function of chromosomes. Which 
of the following observations about inheritance in 
pea plants could be explained only after the 
discovery that genes may be linked on  
a chromosome? 
(A) Pea color and pea shape display independent 
inheritance patterns. 
(B) Offspring of a given cross show all possible 
combinations of traits in equal proportions. 
(C) Most offspring of a given cross have a 
combination of traits that is identical to that 
of either one parent or the other. 
(D) Recessive phenotypes can skip a generation, 
showing up only in the parental and
