tightly to the protein, making ion pairs on the protein sur-
face, which end up giving the protein a zero net charge in 
water and therefore leading to precipitation. Discuss these 
two hypotheses. What kind of measurements would you 
need to make to distinguish between these two hypotheses?
 13.90  Soaps consist of compounds such as sodium stearate, 
CH3(CH2)16COO-Na + , that have both hydrophobic and 
hydrophilic parts. Consider the hydrocarbon part of so-
dium stearate to be the “tail” and the charged part to be the 
“head.”
(a) Which part of sodium stearate, head or tail, is more likely 
to be solvated by water?
(b) Grease is a complex mixture of (mostly) hydrophobic 
compounds. Which part of sodium stearate, head or tail, 
is most likely to bind to grease?
(c) If you have large deposits of grease that you want to 
wash away with water, you can see that adding sodium 
stearate will help you produce an emulsion. What inter-
molecular interactions are responsible for this?
