 conservation of nucleon number.
According to this law, the total number of nucleons (A) remains constant in any
process, although one type can change into the other type (protons into neutrons
or vice versa). This law holds in all three types of decay. [In Chapter 32 we will
generalize this and call it conservation of baryon number.]
Table 30–2 gives a summary of 
and decay.
30–8 Half-Life and Rate of Decay
A macroscopic sample of any radioactive isotope consists of a vast number of
radioactive nuclei. These nuclei do not all decay at one time. Rather, they decay
one by one over a period of time. This is a random process: we can not predict
exactly when a given nucleus will decay. But we can determine, on a probabilistic
basis, approximately how many nuclei in a sample will decay over a given time
period, by assuming that each nucleus has the same probability of decaying in
each second that it exists.
The number of decays 
that occur in a very short time interval 
is then
proportional
