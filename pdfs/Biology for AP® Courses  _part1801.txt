s p53, which is mutated in over 50 percent of all cancer types. The p53 protein itself
functions as a transcription factor. It can bind to sites in the promoters of genes to initiate transcription. Therefore, the
mutation of p53 in cancer will dramatically alter the transcriptional activity of its target genes.

Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/p53_cancer) to learn more about the use of p53 in fighting cancer.
Treatment of cancer is often called a “fight against biology.” Explain why the use of p53 supports this statement.
a.
because normal cells are often negatively affected by cancer treatments, including p53
b.
because cancer cells are always affected by current cancer treatments, including p53
c.
because normal cells are often negatively affected by cancer treatments, with the exception of p53
d.
because cancer cells often aren’t affected by cancer treat
