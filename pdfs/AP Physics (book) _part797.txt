FIGURE 8;1 Looking at a wheel
that is rotating counterclockwise
about an axis through the wheel’s
center at O (axis perpendicular to
the page). Each point, such as 
point P, moves in a circular path;
is the distance P travels as the
wheel rotates through the angle u.

Bike wheel. A bike wheel rotates 4.50 revolutions. How many
radians has it rotated?
APPROACH All we need is a conversion of units using
SOLUTION
4.50 revolutions = (4.50 rev) a 2p rad
rev b
= 9.00p rad = 28.3 rad.
1 revolution = 360° = 2p rad = 6.28 rad.
