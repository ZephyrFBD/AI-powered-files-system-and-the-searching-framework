6.D: Explain the relationship 
between experimental results 
and larger biological concepts, 
processes, or theories.
ENE-1.G: Explain how the 
cellular environment affects 
enzyme activity.

Function
(A) 
Incorrect. There is no evidence that DCMU acts as a buffer.
(B) 
Incorrect. Even if DCMU were also an electron carrier, some change in 
absorbance over the course of the experiment is still expected.
(C) 
Incorrect. If DCMU were also an electron source, then a faster decrease 
in absorbance rather than no change over the length of the experiment 
is expected.
(D) 
Correct. The lack of change in absorbance over the length of the tubes 
containing DCMU indicates that it prevents the flow of electrons. These 
results are similar to those observed in tube 3, when the lack of light 
prevent electrons from flowing.
