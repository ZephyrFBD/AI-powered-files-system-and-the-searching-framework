n(s) derived from known pathogens. Other components, called adjuvants, are delivered
in parallel to help stimulate the immune response. Immunological memory is the reason vaccines work.
Ideally, the effect of vaccination is to elicit immunological memory, and thus resistance to specific pathogens
without the individual having to experience an infection.

Vaccinologists are involved in the process of vaccine development from the initial idea to the availability
of the completed vaccine. This process can take decades, can cost millions of dollars, and can involve
many obstacles along the way. For instance, injected vaccines stimulate the systemic immune system,
eliciting humoral and cell-mediated immunity, but have little effect on the mucosal response, which presents
a challenge because many pathogens are deposited and replicate in mucosal
