that counts, but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population. This concept, called relative fitness, allows
researchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional offspring to the next generation, and thus, how the
population might evolve.
There are several ways selection can affect population variation: stabilizing selection, directional selection, diversifying
selection, frequency-dependent selection, and sexual selection. As natural selection influences the allele frequencies in a
population, individuals can either become more or less genetically similar and the phenotypes displayed can become more
similar or more disparate.
Stabilizing Selection
If natural selection favors an average phenotype, selecting against extreme variation, the population will undergo stabilizing
selection (Figure 19.9). In a population of mice that live in the woods, for example, natural selection is likely to favor
individuals that best blend in with the fore
