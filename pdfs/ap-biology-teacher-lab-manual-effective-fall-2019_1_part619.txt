into separate bands.  
** These bands do not appear on the ideal gel and likely will not be seen.

3. Plot the standard curve using the data from the DNA sample cut with HindIII. To do 
this, your teacher might ask you to graph the data directly using Excel with distance 
traveled as the (arithmetic) x-axis and the base pair (bp) length as the (logarithmic) 
y-axis. Based on this graph, why must the data be plotted using the log scale? You 
might want to plot the data again using semi-log paper.  
Connect the data point with a best-fit line. However, you should ignore the  
point plotted for the 27,491bp/23,130 doublet. When using 0.8% agarose gel, these  
fragments appear as one. Congratulations! Your best-fit line is the standard curve.  
4. Now use the standard curve to calculate the approximate sizes of the EcoRI and 
BamHI fragments. Using a ruler, how can you use th
