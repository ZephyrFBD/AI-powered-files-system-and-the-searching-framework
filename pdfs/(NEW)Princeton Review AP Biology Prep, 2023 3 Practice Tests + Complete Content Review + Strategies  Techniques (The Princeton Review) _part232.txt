nits called antenna
complexes.
All of the pigments within a unit are able to “gather” light, but they’re not able to “excite” electrons. Only one
special molecule—located in the reaction center—is capable of transforming light energy to chemical energy. In
other words, the other pigments, called antenna pigments, “gather” light and “bounce” energy to the reaction
center.
There are two types of reaction centers: photosystem I (PS I) and photosystem II (PS II). The principal difference
between the two is that each reaction center has a specific type of chlorophyll—chlorophyll a—that absorbs a
particular wavelength of light. For example, P680, the reaction center of photosystem II, has a maximum absorption
at a wavelength of 680 nanometers. The reaction center for photosystem I—P700—best absorbs light at a
wavelength of 700 nanometers.
When light energy is used to make ATP, it is called photophosphorylation. Autotrophs are using light (that’s
photo) and ADP and phosphates (that’s phosphor
