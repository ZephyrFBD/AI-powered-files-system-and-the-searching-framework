 are not the result of well-drilling 
activities.
Describe experiments that you could conduct on the waters 
from residential wells to help determine whether and to what ex-
tent well contaminants are due to fracking operations. Among the 
chemicals that might be expected to be employed in fracking opera-
tions are hydrochloric acid, sodium chloride, ethylene glycol, borate 
salts, water-soluble gelling agents such as guar gum, citric acid, meth-
anol, and other alcohols such as isopropanol, and methane. Assume 
that you have available the techniques to make measurements of the 
concentrations of these substances in the residential wells. What 
experiments would you conduct, and what analyses of the results 
would you carry out in an attempt to settle the question of whether 
fracking operations have led to contamination of the well water? 
Would simply measuring the concentrations of some or all of these 
substances in the well waters be sufficient to settle the issue?
