material (DNA) of all organisms is contained in chromosomes that become especially
compact during cell reproduction.
C. The cell cycle is the life cycle of a cell and includes periods when a cell is not dividing as well as those
when it undergoes cell division.
D. Sister chromatids consist of two duplicated chromosomes held together at the centromere.
E. Mitosis occurs in eukaryotes and produces cells with nearly identical genetic makeup.
1. Mitosis is used for the purpose of organismal reproduction in single-celled organisms.
2. It is used for purposes of development and cell replacement in the normal growth and maintenance of
the bodies of multicellular organisms.
F. Prokaryotes generally reproduce by a process called binary fission.
II.
The Cell Cycle
A. The two main phases of the cell cycle are interphase and cell division.
B. Interphase—Cells spend most of their time in interphase.
1. G1 phase—The first phase of interphase is G1 during which the new cell grows to mature size and
