• RNA polymerase synthesizes a new mRNA molecule based on a DNA template
by matching the current DNA base with the proper complement.
• RNA polymerase joins or bonds the newly paired RNA nucleotide and the
growing RNA strand with a covalent bond.

Identify a control group missing from the second experiment.
• An appropriate control group missing from the second experiment.
Either of the strains from the first experiment (wild strain or experimental
strain) but without amanitin is an appropriate control for the second
experiment, but there may be other appropriate controls.

3.C
Justify the need for this control group in the second experiment.
• The response correctly indicates why the missing control is needed to
correctly interpret the results of experiment 2. If either the wild strain or
experimental strain from experiment 1 is se
