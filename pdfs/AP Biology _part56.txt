CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter supported Big Ideas: ENE, IST, and SYI. Life depends on the
properties of water, which result from its polarity and hydrogen bonding.
Water has the following properties:
Strong cohesion force
High specific heat
Universal solvent
Ice is less dense than water
Strong adhesion force
High heat of vaporization
High heat of fusion
The all-important biological concept is—form relates to function. Be able
to give specific examples of each of the following from this chapter:
Different molecules with the same chemical formula (isomers) have
different functions.
The sequence of amino acids in a protein causes the protein to fold
in a particular way (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary
