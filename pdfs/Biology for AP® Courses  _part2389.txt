Virologist
Virology is the study of viruses, and a virologist is an individual trained in this discipline. Training in virology
can lead to many different career paths. Virologists are actively involved in academic research and teaching
in colleges and medical schools. Some virologists treat patients or are involved in the generation and
production of vaccines. They might participate in epidemiologic studies (Figure 21.20) or become science
writers, to name just a few possible careers.
