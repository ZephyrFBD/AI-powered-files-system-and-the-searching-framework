d in parallel to a 120-V source
by two long leads of total resistance 
If 210 mA flows
through each bulb, what is the resistance of each, and what
fraction of the total power is wasted in the leads?
14. (II) A close inspection of an electric circuit reveals that
a
resistor was inadvertently soldered in the place
where a 
resistor is needed. How can this be fixed
without removing anything from the existing circuit?

Problems
17. (II) A 75-W, 120-V bulb is connected in parallel with a
25-W, 120-V bulb. What is the net resistance?
18. (II) (a) Determine the equivalent resistance of the “ladder”
of equal 
resistors shown in Fig.19–49. In other words,
what resistance would an ohmmeter read if connected between
points A and B? (b) What is the current through each of the
three resistors on the left if a 50.0-V battery is connected
between points A and B?
