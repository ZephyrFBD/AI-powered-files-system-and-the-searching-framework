 and wavelength of the sound wave produced in
air at 22°C by this fingered string?
34. (II) (a) Determine the length of an open organ pipe that
emits middle C (262 Hz) when the temperature is 18°C.
(b) What are the wavelength and frequency of the funda-
mental standing wave in the tube? (c) What are 
and f in
the traveling sound wave produced in the outside air?
35. (II) An organ is in tune at 22.0°C. By what percent will the
frequency be off at 11°C?
36. (II) How far from the mouthpiece of the flute in 
Example 12–11 should the hole be that must be uncovered
to play F above middle C at 349 Hz?
37. (II) (a) At  
how long must an open organ pipe
be to have a fundamental frequency of 294 Hz? (b) If this
pipe is filled with helium, what is its fundamental frequency?
38. (II) A particular organ pipe can resonate at 264 Hz,
440 Hz, and 616 Hz, but not at any other frequencies in
between. (a) Show why this is an open or a closed pipe.
(b) What is the fundamental frequency of this pipe?
