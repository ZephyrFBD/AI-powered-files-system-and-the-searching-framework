. Partial results of the experiment are shown in the following
table.
(a) Describe the effect of adding lectin to the cells.
(b) Identify the independent variable and the dependent variable in this experiment.
(c) Based on the data presented, predict the most likely effects of adding only colchicine to the cells.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
12. The following figure represents the concentrations of two different molecules (cyclin and cyclin-dependent
kinase) during the cell cycle, and the arrow indicates the start of mitosis.
(a) Cell division can be described as having three major events: replication of chromosomes, alignment of
chromosomes, and separation of chromosomes. Describe the stages of the cell cycle during which each of
these three major events occurs.
(b) In the figure, which molecule (cyclin or cyclin-dependent kinase) is represented by the line labeled
“Molecule I”? Which molecule (cyclin or cyclin-dependent kinase) is represented by the line labeled
“Molecu
