aries 
greatly among nations. To illustrate, daily fresh water use in the United States approaches 
600 L/person, whereas in the relatively underdeveloped nations of sub-Sahara Africa it is 
only about 30 L. To make matters worse, for many people, water is not only scarce, it is so 
contaminated that it is a continuing source of diseases.
Approximately 20% of the worldâ€™s freshwater is under the soil, in the form of ground-
water. Groundwater resides in aquifers, which are layers of porous rock that hold water. 
The water in aquifers can be very pure, and accessible for human consumption if near the 
surface. Dense underground formations that do not allow water to readily penetrate can 
hold groundwater for years or even millennia. When their water is removed by drilling 
and pumping, such aquifers are slow to recharge via the diffusion of surface water.
