for both
traits still has two alleles for height (T and t) and two alleles for color (G and g). However, because height and color
are located on the same chromosome, one allele for height and one allele for color are physically linked. For
example, maybe the heterozygote has one chromosome with Tg and one chromosome with tG. When gametes are
formed, the T and g will travel together, and t and G will travel together and be packaged into a gamete together. So,
in the unlinked dihybrid shown earlier, there were four possible gamete combinations (TG, Tg, tG, tg), but now there
are only two (Tg and tG). The only way to physically separate linked alleles is by crossing-over. If a crossover event
occurs between linked genes, then recombinant gametes can occur. However, because linked genes are physically
close together, crossing-over is not likely to occur between them.
If the genes were unlinked, then four gametes (TG, Tg, tG, tg) would be equally likely (as we saw when we talked
about indep
