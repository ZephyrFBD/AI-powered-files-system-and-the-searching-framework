Rotational energy adds 
to other forms of energy 
to get the total energy 
which is conserved

CHAPTER 8
Which is fastest? Several objects roll with-
out slipping down an incline of vertical height H, all starting from rest at the
same moment. The objects are a thin hoop (or a plain wedding band), a spherical
marble, a solid cylinder (a D-cell battery), and an empty soup can. In addition,
a greased box slides down without friction. In what order do they reach the
bottom of the incline?
RESPONSE We use conservation of energy with gravitational potential energy
plus rotational and translational kinetic energy. The sliding box would be fastest
because the potentia
