3. Lobe-finned fishes were present in the oceans of 
the world approximately 400 million years ago. 
The first tetrapods (vertebrates that had limbs and 
could move on land) date to about 365 million 
years ago. One hypothesis states that early 
tetrapods evolved from lobe-finned fishes. Which 
of the following is the best plan for testing the 
hypothesis? 
(A) Determining the number of fins found  
  
on lobe-finned fishes from different  
geographical locations  
(B) Measuring the proportion of radioisotopes 
found in fossils of early tetrapods 
(C) Comparing the arrangements of bones in the 
fins of lobe-finned fishes and limbs of the 
earliest tetrapods 
(D) Sequencing DNA isolated from fossils of 
lobe-finned fishes to determine the size of 
the genome
