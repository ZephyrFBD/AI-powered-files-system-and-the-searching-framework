41. A. As
 
increases (moves to the right on the graph), hemoglobin
saturation also increases (moves up on the graph). Note that the graph does not tell you anything about cause and
effect—which quantity causes an effect in the other quantity. It’s possible that they both increase together for
unrelated reasons.
42. D. The plot representing a higher than normal acid environment (which is a lower than normal pH, or in this
graph, pH = 7.2), is below the plot representing a normal pH (pH = 7.4). The lower curve corresponds with lower
hemoglobin saturation. Be extra careful with questions that have pH or acid/base information. Make notes on the test
indicating which pH is acid and which is basic.
43. A. When respiration is high, more CO2 is produced. As CO2 enters
 
the blood, it diffuses into red blood cells, where the enzyme carbonic
 
anhydrase combines the CO2 with H2O to form H+ and HCO3−. These
 
ions return to the blood, where the increase in H+ lowers the pH (makes
