 energy is converted into kinetic energy. 
The potential energy decreases as the bicycle rolls down the hill, while at the same time 
its kinetic energy increases as it picks up speed (Equation 1.2). This example illustrates 
that kinetic and potential energy are interconvertible.
Gravitational forces play a negligible role in the ways that atoms and molecules 
interact with one another. Forces that arise from electrical charges are more important 
 
when dealing with atoms and molecules. One of the most important forms of 
potential energy in chemistry is electrostatic potential energy, which arises from the 
interactions between charged particles. You are probably familiar with the fact that 
opposite charges attract each other and like charges repel. The strength of this inter-
action increases as the magnitude of the charges increase, and decreases as the dis-
tance between charges increases. We will return to electrostatic energy several times 
throughout the book.
