The addition reaction between HBr and an alkene, for instance, 
is thought to proceed in two steps. In the ﬁrst step, which is rate 
determining 
 (Section 14.6), HBr attacks the electron-rich double 
bond, transferring a proton to one of the double-bond carbons. In the 
reaction of 2-butene with HBr, for example, the ﬁrst step is
CH3CH

The electron pair that formed the p bond is used to form the new 
C ¬ H bond.
The second, faster step is addition of Br- to the positively 
charged carbon. The bromide ion donates a pair of electrons to the 
carbon, forming the C ¬Br bond:
CH3CH

CH2CH3

Because the rate-determining step involves both the alkene and 
the acid, the rate law for the reaction is second order, ﬁrst order in 
the alkene and ﬁrst order in HBr:
Rate = -
