kiss.-- [Kisses her.] Her lips suck forth my soul:  see, where it flies!--
Come, Helen, come, give me my soul again. Here will I dwell, for heaven
is in these lips, And all is dross that is not Helena. I will be Paris, and for
love of thee, Instead of Troy, shall Wittenberg be sack'd; And I will
combat with weak Menelaus, And wear thy colours on my plumed crest;
Yea, I will wound Achilles in the heel, And then return to Helen for a kiss.
O, thou art fairer than the evening<241> air Clad in the beauty of a
thousand stars; Brighter art thou than flaming Jupiter When he appear'd to
hapless Semele; More lovely than the monarch of the sky In wanton
Arethusa's azur'd<242> arms; And none but thou shalt<243> be my
paramour! [Exeunt.]
