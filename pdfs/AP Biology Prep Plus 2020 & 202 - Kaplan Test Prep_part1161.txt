 of the experiment was “to study the
eﬀects of saline soils on plant development.” As such, the correct
conclusion is one that incorporates both of these elements: something
about the salinity of the soil, and something about the plant’s
development. (D) fits these parameters and makes an appropriate
statement about the data. (A) is incorrect because the students’ goal was
not to compare fresh and dry weight of plants. (B) is incorrect because the
students measured the electrical conductivity of the soil, not the “saline
content.” Finally, (C), while it connects the electrical conductivity
measurement to the biomass, describes a relationship that is not
supported by the data.
43. B
Under normal conditions, with non-saline soil, the driving force for the
uptake of water into the roots of the plant is that the root sap is hypertonic
compared to the soil; this creates a concentration gradient that drives
water into the roots. With saline soil, the opposite is true: the soil is
hypertonic
