e, which stiffens the cell walls of the plant (Figure
5.13). In nonwoody plants, turgor pressure supports the plant. Conversly, if the plant is not watered, the extracellular fluid
will become hypertonic, causing water to leave the cell. In this condition, the cell does not shrink because the cell wall is
not flexible. However, the cell membrane detaches from the wall and constricts the cytoplasm. This is called plasmolysis.
Plants lose turgor pressure in this condition and wilt (Figure 5.14).
Figure 5.13 The turgor pressure within a plant cell depends on the tonicity of the solution that it is bathed in. (credit:

Figure 5.14 Without adequate water, the plant on the left has lost turgor pressure, visible in its wilting; the turgor
pressure is restored by watering it (right). (credit: Victor M. Vicente Selvas)
Tonicity is a concern for all living things. For example, paramecia and amoebas, which are protists that lack cell walls, have
