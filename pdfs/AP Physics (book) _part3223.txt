nuclei for the negative charge concentration between them.
Why a bond is formed can also be understood from the energy point of view.
When the two H atoms approach close to one another, if the spins of their elec-
trons are opposite, the electrons can occupy the same space, as discussed above.
This means that each electron can now move about in the space of two atoms
instead of in the volume of only one. Because each electron now occupies more
space, it is less well localized. From the uncertainty principle with 
larger, we
see that 
and the minimum momentum can be less. With less momentum, each
electron has less energy when the two atoms combine than when they are separate.
That is, the molecule has less energy than the two separate atoms, and so is 
more stable. An energy input is required to break the 
molecule into two separate
H atoms, so the 
molecule is a stable entity. This is what we mean by a bond.
The energy required to break a bond is called the bond energy, the binding en
