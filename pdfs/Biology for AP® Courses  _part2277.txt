oloration seen in certain aphids, and it has
been further shown that when this gene is inactivated by mutation, the aphids revert back to their more common green color
(Figure 20.13).
Figure 20.13 (a) Red aphids get their color from red carotenoid pigment. Genes necessary to make this pigment are
present in certain fungi, and scientists speculate that aphids acquired these genes through HGT after consuming fungi
for food. If genes for making carotenoids are inactivated by mutation, the aphids revert back to (b) their green color.
Red coloration makes the aphids a lot more conspicuous to predators, but evidence suggests that red aphids are more
resistant to insecticides than green ones. Thus, red aphids may be more fit to survive in some environments than green
ones. (credit a: modification of work by Benny Mazur; credit b: modification of work by Mick Talbot)
