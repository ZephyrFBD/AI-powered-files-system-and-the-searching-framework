re chemical messengers that regulate
metabolism and blood vessel production and dilation. High
concentrations of adipocytokines are commonly found
among individuals with abnormal autoimmune response.
Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) is involved
in the trafficking or guiding of monocytes to damaged
tissue, as in a wound. In mice, leptin receptors of cells in
the hypothalamus suppress hunger. Interleukin (IL-6) is
released to initiate and then regulate inflammation in
response to an infection. The mice in this study were not
infected or wounded.

Construct an explanation, with reasoning
based on the evidence provided by these data,
for the observed variations in adipocytokines.
Many noncommunicable diseases are associated with
abnormal autoimmune responses, and the number of
diseases that involve abnormal autoimmune response is
increasing. Many autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes
and heart disease, occur in developed nations at a much
higher frequency than in developing nat
