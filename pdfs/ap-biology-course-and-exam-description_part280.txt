inding, and/or designing an 
experiment to investigate the effect of temperature 
on chloroplast function, including collecting data, 
making predictions, drawing conclusions, and refining 
the original question or approaches. Students need 
to learn to formulate good scientific questions that 
lend themselves to experimental approaches and 
can be evaluated using data and addressed through 
hypothesis testing. After identifying possible sources of 
error in an experimental procedure or data set, students 
should then revise the protocol to obtain more valid 
results. When presented with a range of data, students 
should identify outliers and propose an explanation 
for them as well as a justification for how they should 
beÂ handled.
