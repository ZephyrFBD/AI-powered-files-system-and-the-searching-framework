t the coal or turf or 
 
 blocks to be boiling water? 
 
 Dad says nothing. He finishes his tea and looks for a nail to hang 
 
 our one picture.The man in the picture has a thin face. He wears a yel- 
 
 92 
 
 low skullcap and a black robe with a cross on his chest. Dad says he was 
 
 a Pope,Leo the Thirteenth,a great friend of the workingman.He brought 
 
  
  
 this picture all the way from America where he found it thrown out by 
 
 someone who had no time for the workingman. Mam says he’s talking 
 
 a lot of bloody nonsense and he says she shouldn’t say bloody in front 
 
 of the children. Dad finds a nail but wonders how he’s going to get it 
 
 into the wall without a hammer. Mam says he could go borrow one 
 
 from the people next door but he says you don’t go around borrowing 
 
 from people you don’t know. He leans the picture against the wall and 
 
 drives the nail with the bottom of a jam jar.The jam jar breaks and cuts 
 
 his hand and a blob of blood falls on the Pope
