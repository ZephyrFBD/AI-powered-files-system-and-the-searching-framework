with the following equation.
Map distance (in map units) = [(# recombinants) / (# total offspring)] × 100.
LAB 8: BIOTECHNOLOGY: BACTERIAL TRANSFORMATION
In this lab, the principles of genetic engineering are studied. Biotechnologists are able to insert genes into an
organism’s DNA in order to introduce new traits or phenotypes, like inserting genes into a corn genome that help the
crops ward off pests. This process is very complicated in higher plants and animals, but relatively simple in bacteria.
You are responsible for knowing the ways in which bacteria can accept fragments of foreign DNA:
Conjugation: the transfer of genetic material between bacteria via a pilus, a bridge between the two cells
Transformation: a process in which bacteria take up foreign genetic material from the environment
Transduction: a process in which a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria) transfers genetic material from
one bacteria to another
In addition, DNA can also be inserted into bacteria by us
