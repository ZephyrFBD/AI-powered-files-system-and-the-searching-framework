e
membrane width, and their juxtaposition provides the proper
architecture to allow chemical reactions to take place. The most
important thing to remember about fine protein structures is that their
location and form are what allow chemiosmosis to happen.
CATABOLISM
Catabolism is the breaking down of complex substances into simple
substances, making energy available in the process. In anaerobic
catabolism, there is no electron transport chain or oxygen (O2) available
to carry out a reaction. Anaerobic reactions require almost as much
energy to carry out as they yield. From an evolutionary perspective, it is
much more advantageous to have the ability to utilize the oxidative
properties of oxygen, as reactions in aerobic catabolism do, because
more energy can be generated. For more on the aerobic and anaerobic
catabolism of glucose, see chapter 10.
Keep in mind that not all energy comes from sugar in the form of glucose.
Organisms use food in the form of carbohydrates (starch), protein,
