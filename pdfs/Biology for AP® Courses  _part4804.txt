rve for wolves, which range hundreds of kilometers, must be much larger than a
preserve for butterflies, which might range within ten kilometers during its lifetime. But larger preserves have more core
area of optimal habitat for individual species, they have more niches to support more species, and they attract more species
because they can be found and reached more easily.
Preserves perform better when there are buffer zones around them of suboptimal habitat. The buffer allows organisms to
exit the boundaries of the preserve without immediate negative consequences from predation or lack of resources. One large
preserve is better than the same area of several smaller preserves because there is more core habitat unaffected by edges.
For this same reason, preserves in the shape of a square or circle will be better than a preserve with many thin “arms.” If
preserves must be smaller, then providing wildlife corridors between them so that individuals and their genes can move
between the pr
