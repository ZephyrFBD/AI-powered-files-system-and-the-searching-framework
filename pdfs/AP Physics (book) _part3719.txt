Black Holes
According to Einstein’s theory of general relativity (sometimes abbreviated GR),
space-time is curved near massive objects. We might think of space as being 
like a thin rubber sheet: if a heavy weight is placed on the sheet, it sags 
as shown in Fig. 33–19a (top of next page). The weight corresponds to a 
huge mass that causes space (space itself!) to curve. Thus, in the context of
