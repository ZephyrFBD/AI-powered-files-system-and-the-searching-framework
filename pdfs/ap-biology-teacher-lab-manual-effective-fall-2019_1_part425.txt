■SYNOPSES OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
In  Investigation 7: Cell Division: Mitosis and Meiosis,  students 
begin by thinking about how they developed from a single-celled zygote to an organism 
with trillions of cells. After students model mitosis and review chromosome duplication 
and movement, they set up an independent investigation using onion bulb squashes and 
lectins to explore what substances in the environment might increase or decrease the 
rate of mitosis, and then they statistically analyze their results by calculating chi-square 
values. This part of the investigation raises questions about mitosis, and students are 
asked to formulate hypotheses about how chromosomes of cancer cells, such as HeLa 
cells, might appear in comparison to normal cells
