 resting potential.
 
37. B. During stage B, Na+ channels fully open, allowing Na+ to rush
 
across the plasma membrane. This establishes the action potential. For additional explanation, see answer to
question 36.
38. B. The action potential is initiated when a depolarizing stimulus causes the plasma membrane to exceed the
threshold potential, which is
-55 mV in the figure.
39. C. At the resting potential, the plasma membrane of a neuron is
polarized at –70 mV During stage B, Na+ voltage-gated ion channels fully open, allowing Na+ to enter the cell,
making the inside of the cell
 
more positive, thus depolarizing the –70 mV resting potential. 40. D. The repolarization event during stage C
generates a voltage less than –70 mV (–90 mV in the figure)—a hyperpolarization.
 
41. A. NADP+ is the recipient of energized electrons from photosystem I.
 
When reduced (energized) by these electrons from photosystem I, DPIP turns from blue to clear.
42. C. Light (present or absent) and chloroplast
