generation. However, there must be a balance between the benefits of a
behavior and the costs. Think about foraging behavior (all the behaviors
involved in food gathering and eating). The benefits of eating are obvious.
A robust, well-fed animal will have an advantage in competition for a
mate. However, foraging has costs that might not be so obvious. Besides
all the energy expended in foraging, it might be dangerous. For example,
an animal might have to chase away another predator for the remains of a
