s called acid rain. Acid rain lowers the pH of aquatic
ecosystems and soil, which damages water systems, plants, and soil. For example, change in soil pH causes
calcium and other nutrients to leach out, which damages plant roots and stunts their growth. Furthermore, useful
microorganisms that release nutrients from decaying organic matter into the soil are also killed, resulting in
fewer nutrients being available for the plants. Low pH also kills fish, especially those that have just hatched.
Desertification: When land is overgrazed by animals, it turns grasslands into deserts and reduces available
habitats for organisms.
Deforestation: When forests are cleared (especially by the slash and burn method), erosion, floods, and changes
in weather patterns can occur.
Pollution: Another environmental concern is toxic chemicals in our environment. One example is DDT, a
pesticide used to control insects. DDT was overused at one time and later found to damage plants and animals
worldwide. DDT i
