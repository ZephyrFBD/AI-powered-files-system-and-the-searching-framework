green leaves and with anthocyanin (purple stems) and without anthocyanin. 
In other words, these are F1 plants from a dihybrid cross. By using this stock and 
carefully managing the pollination and the offspring, your class can begin two separate 
investigations with one seed generation. Your class can investigate artificial selection 
with the quantitative trait of hairiness or stem color, and with the same plant population 
you can raise an F2 generation of a dihybrid cross for a classical Mendelian investigation 
on genetics. The advantage is that the 90% of the population not selected for hairs can 
continue to be grown by the individual students to produce an F2 generation. The seed 
from this cross can be used in a genetic cross demonstration/experiment, as described in 
the Fast Plant publication “Who’s the Father?” 
(http://www.fastplants.org/pdf/WTF_di.pdf). 
It is recommended that you build your own light racks and growing systems following
