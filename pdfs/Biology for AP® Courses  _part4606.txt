bances are a result of natural processes. For example,
when lightning causes a forest fire and destroys part of a forest ecosystem, the ground is eventually populated by grasses,
then by bushes and shrubs, and later by mature trees, restoring the forest to its former state. The impact of environmental
disturbances caused by human activities is as important as the changes wrought by natural processes. Human agricultural
practices, air pollution, acid rain, global deforestation, overfishing, eutrophication, oil spills, and illegal dumping on land
and into the ocean are all issues of concern to conservationists.
Equilibrium is the steady state of an ecosystem where all organisms are in balance with their environment and with each
other. In ecology, two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems: resistance and resilience. The ability of an
ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances is called resistance. The speed at which an ecosystem recovers
equilibrium after
