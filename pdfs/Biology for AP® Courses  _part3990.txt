15. Which cells are unique to the humoral immune
response?
a.
cytotoxic T cells
b.
antigen-presenting cells
c.

d.

16. How does the humoral immune response operate?
a.
The humoral immune response primarily targets
infected host cells to destroy them before the
infecting pathogen can reproduce.
b.
The humoral immune response produces
antibodies that are specifically targeted against
each pathogen.
c.
The humoral immune response produces
cytotoxic T cells that induce apoptosis in
pathogen-infected cells.
d.
The humoral immune response is the only
system that involves memory cells that are able
to respond later to a pathogen that has invaded
the body at an earlier time.

the antigen t
