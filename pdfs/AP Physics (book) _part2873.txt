the lenses is 14.8 cm, and (b) the total magnification.
49. (II) The eyepiece of a compound microscope has a focal
length of 2.80 cm and the objective lens has 
If an object is placed 0.790 cm from the objective lens,
calculate (a) the distance between the lenses when the
microscope is adjusted for a relaxed eye, and (b) the total
magnification.
50. (III) An inexpensive instructional lab microscope allows
the user to select its objective lens to have a focal length 
of 32 mm, 15 mm, or 3.9 mm. It also has two possible
eyepieces with magnifications 
and 
Each objective
forms a real image 160 mm beyond its focal point. What
are the largest and smallest overall magnifications obtain-
able with this instrument?
25â€“6 Lens Aberrations
51. (II) An achromatic lens is made of two very thin lenses,
placed in contact, that have focal lengths
and 
(a) Is the combination converging or
diverging? (b) What is the net focal length?
