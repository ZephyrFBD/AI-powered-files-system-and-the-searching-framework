 the direction of energy flow.
1. A food chain is a linear flow chart of who eats whom. For example, a food chain depicting energy flow in a
savanna may look like this: grass → zebra → lion → vulture
2. A food web is an expanded, more complete version of a food chain. It would show all of the major plants in the
ecosystem, the various animals that eat the plants (such as insects, rodents, zebras, giraffes, and antelopes), and the
animals that eat the animals (lions, hyenas, jackals, and vultures). Detritivores may also be included in the food web.
Arrows connect all organisms that are eaten to the animals that eat them, pointing in the direction of energy flow.
Another way to illustrate energy flow and the production and utilization of energy is to organize plants and animals
into groups called trophic levels. In general, organisms are either autotrophs that are able obtain energy from light
or inorganic material or they are heterotrophs that must consume other organisms or organic mat
