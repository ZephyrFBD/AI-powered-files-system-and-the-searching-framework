ry pores that open on the body surface. Cilia also
draw water from the interstitial fluid, allowing for
filtration. Any valuable metabolites are recovered by
reabsorption. What structure in the human kidneys most
closely resembles the cilia of the protonephridia, and why?
a.
The renal artery, because it facilitates the
exchange of nutrients with the blood
b.
The convoluted tubule, because it facilitates the
exchange of nutrients with the blood
c.
The glomerulus, because it facilitates filtering of
the blood
d.
The ureter, because it facilitates filtering of the
blood
57. Planaria are flatworms that live in fresh water. Their
excretory system, or protonephridia, consists of two
tubules connected to a highly branched tube system. The
intake end of the tubes contain cilia that propel waste
matter down the tubules and out of the body through
excretory pores that open on the body surface. Cilia also
draw water from the interstitial fluid, allowing for
filtration. Any valuable metabolites ar
