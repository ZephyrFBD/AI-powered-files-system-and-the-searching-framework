transcription factors cannot bind and gene expression is turned off. When the nucleosomes are spaced far apart
(bottom), the DNA is exposed. Transcription factors can bind, allowing gene expression to occur. Modifications to
the histones and DNA affect nucleosome spacing.
In females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated during embryonic development because of epigenetic changes
to the chromatin. What impact do you think these changes would have on nucleosome packing?
a.
Methylation of DNA and hypo-acetylation of histones causes the nucleosomes to pack loosely together,
inactivating one of the X chromosomes.
b.
Methylation of histones and hyper-acetylation of DNA causes the nucleosomes to pack tightly together,
inactivating one of the X chromosome due to transcriptional repression.
c.
Methylation of DNA and hypo-acetylation of histones causes the nucleosomes to pack tightly together,
inactivating one of the X chromosomes.
d.
Acetylation of DNA and hyper-methylation of
