one of many specific receptor proteins on
the postsynaptic membrane. Depending on the neurotransmitter and the type of postsynaptic membrane, the binding
of the neurotransmitter to the receptor will cause an influx of
Na+ or an efflux of K+, resulting in an excitatory postsynaptic potential
 
or an inhibitory postsynaptic potential, respectively.
This question requires you to address similar mechanisms that occur in different physiological systems. This kind of
question evaluates your breadth of knowledge and is often used on the AP exam.
Note that all three answers involve receptors on the plasma membrane. If you write an introductory sentence about
the role of the plasma membrane in recognition mechanisms, you must restate the plasma membraneâ€™s role in each
and every section of the question. Since each question is scored separately, you will receive points each time you
indicate that the plasma membrane is involved.
Question 2
For any of these questions, you should first state whethe
