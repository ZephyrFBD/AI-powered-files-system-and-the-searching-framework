Biotechnology
Recombinant DNA contains DNA segments or genes from different sources. DNA transferred from one part of a
DNA molecule to another, from one chromosome to another chromosome, or from one organism to another, all
constitute recombinant DNA. The transfer of DNA segments can occur naturally through viral transduction,
bacterial conjugation, or transposons. It is also a regular event in eukaryotes as a result of crossing over during
prophase of meiosis. Recombinant DNA can also be produced artificially with biotechnology. Biotechnology is the
use of biological systems to modify organisms or produce desired products. This definition addresses a range of
activitiesâ€”from selected breeding of plants or animals to manipulating bacteria to produce human insulin.
Recombinant DNA technology uses restriction enzymes (restriction endonucleases) to cut up DNA. Restriction
enzymes are obtained from bacteria th
