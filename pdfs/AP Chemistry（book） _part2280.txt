utely specific, operating for only one substance in only one reaction. The decom-
position of hydrogen peroxide, for example, is an important biological process. 
Because hydrogen peroxide is strongly oxidizing, it can be physiologically harmful. 
For this reason, the blood and liver of mammals contain an enzyme, catalase, that

catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxy-
gen (Equation 14.31). Figure 14.25 shows the dramatic acceleration of this 
chemical reaction by the catalase in beef liver.
The reaction any given enzyme catalyzes takes place at a specific location 
in the enzyme called the active site. The substances that react at this site are 
called substrates. The lock-and-key model provides a simple explanation 
for the specificity of an enzyme (Figure 14.26). The substra
