The Lab Mindset
There are no specific labs you need to know for the AP® Biology exam. However, you will encounter exam
questions that require you to apply science practices to real-world scenarios. You will thus need to know how
to design and conduct valid experiments. As a result, understanding the six science practices covered in
Chapter 26: Science Practices and Essay Writing is pivotal to your success on the exam.
Be ready to use your applied knowledge rather than relying on simple factual recall. You may see unfamiliar
lab material on the exam: Don’t be flustered by it. Focus instead on using the science practices “to develop
and refine testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena,” as the College Board puts it in the
2019–2020 AP® Biology Course and Exam Description.
There are no required labs that will be tested on the exam, but if you understand the labs discussed here, you will be able to
