Proteins have different shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are globular in shape whereas others are fibrous in
nature. For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is a fibrous protein. Protein shape is
critical to its function, and this shape is maintained by many different types of chemical bonds. Changes in temperature, pH,
and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to loss of function, known as
denaturation. All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the most common 20 types of amino acids.
Amino Acids
Amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins. Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure, which consists
of a ce
