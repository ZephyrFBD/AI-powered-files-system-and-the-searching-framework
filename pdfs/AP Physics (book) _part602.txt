 the opposite direction on the hand, as shown in

[spring force]
(6;8)
This force is sometimes called a “restoring force” because the spring exerts its
force in the direction opposite the displacement (hence the minus sign), acting to
return it to its natural length. Equation 6–8 is known as the spring equation and
also as Hooke’s law, and is accurate for springs as long as x is not too great.
To calculate the potential energy of a stretched spring, let us calculate the
work required to stretch it (Fig. 6–14b). We might hope to use Eq. 6–1 for the
work done on it,
where x is the amount it is stretched from its natural
length. But this would be incorrect since the force 
is not constant but
varies over the distance x, becoming greater the more the spring is stretched, as
shown graphically in Fig. 6–15. So let us use the average force,
Since 
varies
linearly, from zero at the unstretched position to kx when stretched to x, the
average force is  
where x here is the final amount
