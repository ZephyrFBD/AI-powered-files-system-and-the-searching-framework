5. Record and graph your data. 
For Procedure 2: 
Follow steps 1, 2, and 3 above. In step 4, set up as outlined above. Make an initial 
reading at time “0” and a second reading at the time you chose as optimal based on 
results obtained in Procedure 1. Record and graph your data.

n = sample size 
s = sample standard deviation (i.e., the sample-
based estimate of the standard deviation of 
the population) 
o = observed results 
e = expected results 
∑ = sum of all 
Degrees of freedom are equal to the number of 
distinct possible outcomes minus one.
