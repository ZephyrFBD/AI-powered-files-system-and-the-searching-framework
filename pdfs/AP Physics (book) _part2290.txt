strings as shown in Fig. 20–67. If the 
suspension strings make an angle of 3.0°
with the vertical and are hanging freely,
what is the current in the wires?

84. Suppose the Earth’s magnetic field at the equator has
magnitude 
and a northerly direction at all
points. Estimate the speed a singly ionized uranium ion
would need to circle the Earth 6.0 km
above the equator. Can you ignore gravity? [Ignore relativity.]

(Looking along them, they are at three corners of an equi-
lateral triangle.) The current in each wire is 8.00 A, but i
