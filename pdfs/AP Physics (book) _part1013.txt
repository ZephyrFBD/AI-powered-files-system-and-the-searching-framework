80. When a wood shelf of mass 6.6 kg is fastened inside a slot in a
vertical support as shown in Fig. 9–92, the support exerts a
torque on the shelf. (a) Draw a free-body diagram for the
shelf, assuming three vertical forces (two exerted by the
support slot—explain why). Then calculate (b) the magni-
tudes of the three forces and (c) the torque exerted by the
support (about the left end of the shelf).
81. A cubic crate of side
is top-heavy: its CG is
18 cm above its true center. How steep an incline can the
crate rest on without tipping over? [Hint: The normal force
would act at the lowest corne
