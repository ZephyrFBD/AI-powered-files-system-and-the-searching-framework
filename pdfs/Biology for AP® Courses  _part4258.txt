ctor in the greenhouse effect: the warming of Earth due to carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Evidence supports the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and temperature: as carbon
dioxide rises, global temperature rises. Since 1950, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased from
about 280 ppm to 382 ppm in 2006. In 2011, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration was 392 ppm. However, the
planet would not be inhabitable by current life forms if water vapor did not produce its drastic greenhouse warming effect.
Scientists look at patterns in data and try to explain differences or deviations from these patterns. The atmospheric carbon
dioxide data reveal a historical pattern of carbon dioxide increasing and decreasing, cycling between a low of 180 ppm and
a high of 300 ppm. Scientists have concluded that it took around 50,000 years for the atmospheric carbon dioxide level to
