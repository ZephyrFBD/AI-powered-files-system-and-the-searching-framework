 a 
paper-based alternative can easily be provided if the 
equipment is unavailable. Students may use computers 
or graphing calculators to analyze data and present 
their findings, but they do not need to do so. 
It is important that the AP Biology laboratory program 
be adapted to local conditions and funding even while 
it aims to offer the students a well-rounded experience 
with experimental biology. Adequate lab facilities should 
be provided so that each student has a work space 
where equipment and materials can be left overnight if 
necessary. Sufficient lab glassware for the anticipated 
enrollment and appropriate instruments (balances, and 
pH meters) should be provided.
Students in AP Biology will find it helpful to have access 
to computers with software appropriate for processing 
lab data and writing reports. A lab assistant in the form 
of a paid or unpaid aide may also be helpful; previous 
students may be able to earn credit by serving as 
assistants in the lab.
