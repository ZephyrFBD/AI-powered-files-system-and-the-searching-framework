des of the two plants are
identical, then they must belong to the same
species. Also, if genes transplanted between the
plants function successfully, then the plants must
be similar enough to each other to belong to the
same species.
d.
If scientists are able to find the common ancestor
of the two groups in the fossil record or in
neighboring communities, then they can
determine whether the plants have diverged into
separate species or remain a single species.
65. Assuming a population that has genetic variation and is
under the influence of natural selection, place the
following events in the order in which they would occur:
•
Genetic frequencies within the population change.
•
A change occurs in the population’s environment.
•
Phenotypic variations shift.
•
Individuals who are well-adapted leave more
offspring than individuals who are poorly adapted.
•
Individuals who are poorly adapted do not survive at
the same rate as individuals who are well adapted.
