Fig. 17–13a), the capacitance is given by
[parallel-plate capacitor]
(17;8)
We see that C depends only on geometric factors, A and d, and not on Q or V.
We derive this useful relation in the optional subsection at the end of this Section.
The constant 
is the permittivity of free space, which, as we saw in Chapter 16,
has the value 8.85 * 10–12 C2Nm2.
