 consumers, and the 
complex interactions between organisms in a community.  
 Investigation 11: Transpiration  is a revision of Laboratory 9 (Transpiration) 
in the 2001 AP Biology Lab Manual. The revision reflects the changes in the overall AP 
Biology program, moving from a teacher-directed investigation to a guided, inquiry-based 
exploration of transpiration in plants. With a new twist, students begin by calculating leaf 
surface area, and then determine the average number of stomata per square millimeter 
of leaf. Their data should generate several questions, including Are surface area and the 
number of stomata related to the rate of transpiration? Do all parts of a plant transpire? 
Do all plants transpire at the same rate? and Is there a relationship between habitats in 
which plants evolved to their rates of transpiration? Students design and conduct their own 
experiments to investigate answers to questions they generate about factors — such as 
environmental variables — tha
