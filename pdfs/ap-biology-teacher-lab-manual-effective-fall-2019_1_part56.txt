ake choices in different colors of light. (Different ends of the 
chambers could be wrapped in transparent colored films or acetate.)
• Determine if the ripeness of the fruit makes a difference. For example, ripe bananas 
could be compared to green bananas.
• Determine if fruit flies are attracted to or repelled by carbon dioxide by placing pieces 
of Alka-Seltzer in moist cotton balls.
• Determine the effect of age or the developmental stage of the fruit fly on choice by 
using newly emerged flies in the chamber and/or the third instar larva on a glass slide.
• Work with different mutants of fruit flies to determine if vestigial or white-eyed flies 
(or other mutants) make the same choices. Determine if the Adh-negative mutant 
affects the flies’ response to alcohol. Determine if mutant eye colors (white, cinnabar, 
brown) affect the flies’ response to light.
• Are there other organisms that respond like fruit flies? Can you think of any 
organisms that respond differently?
