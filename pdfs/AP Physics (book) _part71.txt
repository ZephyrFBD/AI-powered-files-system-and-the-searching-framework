es. But it is valuable to think of light as made up of waves, because
experiments indicate that light behaves in many respects as water waves do.
The purpose of a model is to give us an approximate mental or visual
picture—something to hold on to—when we cannot see what actually is
happening. Models often give us a deeper understanding: the analogy to a known
system (for instance, the water waves above) can suggest new experiments to
perform and can provide ideas about what other related phenomena might
occur.
You may wonder what the difference is between a theory and a model.
Usually a model is relatively simple and provides a structural similarity to the
phenomena being studied. A theory is broader, more detailed, and can give
quantitatively testable predictions, often with great precision. It is important, how-
ever, not to confuse a model or a theory with the real system or the phenomena
themselves.
