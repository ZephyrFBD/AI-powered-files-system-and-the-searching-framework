hite light falls on such a film, the path difference ABC will equal 
(or
with
integer) for only one wavelength at a given viewing angle.
The color corresponding to 
( in air) will be seen as very bright. For light viewed
at a slightly different angle, the path difference ABC will be longer or shorter 
and a different color will undergo constructive interference. Thus, for an extended
(nonpoint) source emitting white light, a series of bright colors will be seen next
to one another. Variations in thickness of the film will also alter the path differ-
ence ABC and therefore affect the color of light that is most strongly reflected.
EXERCISE E Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 679, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.
When a curved glass surface is placed in contact with a flat glass surface,
Fig. 24â€“31, a series of concentric rings is seen when illuminated from above 
by either white light (as shown) or by monochromatic
