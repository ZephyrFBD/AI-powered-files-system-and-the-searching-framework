an 1.5 W of heat per meter of length?
70. Determine the resistance of the tungsten filament in a
75-W 120-V incandescent lightbulb (a) at its operating tem-
perature of about 2800 K, (b) at room temperature.
71. Suppose a current is given by the equation 
where I is in amperes and t in seconds. (a) What is the 
frequency? (b) What is the rms value of the current? (c) If
this is the current through a 
resistor, write the
equation that describes the voltage as a function of time.
72. A microwave oven running at 65% efficiency delivers 950 W
to the interior. Find (a) the power drawn from the source,
and (b) the current drawn. Assume a source voltage of 120 V.
73. A 
wire is stretched uniformly to 1.50 times its origi-
nal length. What is its resistance now?
74. 220 V is applied to two different conductors made of the
same material. One conductor is twice as long and twice
the diameter of the second. What is the ratio of the power
transformed in the first relative to the second?
