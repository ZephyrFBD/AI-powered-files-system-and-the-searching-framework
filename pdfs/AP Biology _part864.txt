e the water potential equals
the solute potential of the plant tissue (–0.4) plus the pressure
potential (–0.3), the answer is –0.1. (SP 4)
(B) Water moves from the highest water potential to the lowest. In a
plant, water moves from the soil to the roots to the stems and leaves
and into the air spaces in the spongy mesophyll and out to the
environment. (SP 4)
(D) Since the bags did not all weigh the same mass at the start, the
only way to control for the variation is to show change in mass as a
percentage. (SP 4)
(B) The rate is equal to the product divided by the time. Choose any
point on the line for 0°C. For example, 0.4 divided by 10 equals
0.04. Also, 0.2 divided by 5 equals 0.04. This value (0.04) will be
the resulting rate for any point on the graph. (SP 4)
(C) There are two cell divisions: meiosis, which is for the production
of gametes only, and mitosis, which is for growth and repair. The
independent assortment of alleles occurs during meiosis when
homologous chromosomes line
