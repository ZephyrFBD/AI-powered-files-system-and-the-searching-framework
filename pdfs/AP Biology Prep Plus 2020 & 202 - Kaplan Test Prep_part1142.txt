enesis, then Down syndrome would not have
occurred: eliminating (D).
12. B
Only (B) shows a cladogram that does not match the data given in the
table. According to the table, species 4 is more closely related to species 5
than species 7, and thus the cladogram should show species 4 sharing a
closer common ancestor with species 5, rather than with species 7. The
same logic applies when looking at the last common ancestor for species
4 and species 2. The cladogram suggests species 4 shares a more recent
common ancestor with species 2 than with species 5, which doesn’t match
the information given in the table.
13. C
Although the individual microorganisms that make up the biofilm are r-
strategists, the biofilm itself acts more like a K-selected species (it doesn’t
reproduce quickly, it’s energy-eﬀicient, it’s large, and it’s organized).
Therefore, it will follow a logistic, not an exponential, pattern of growth:
eliminate (A) and (B). (C) is the correct answer, since the axes are not
labe
