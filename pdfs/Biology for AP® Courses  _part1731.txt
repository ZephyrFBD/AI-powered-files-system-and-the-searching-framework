lves TBP.
Scientists attribute this common characteristic to the
relative thermostability of the A-T interaction. Hydrogen
bonds hold the two strands of the DNA double helix
together. This type of bond has the smallest interaction
energy of all intermolecular forces; as temperature
increases, these bonds are broken.
A. Explain the advantage, in terms of the energy required,
which is provided by an AT-rich region in the sequence
where transcription is initiated.
B. The fact that the TATA box or the associated TBP are
common to all domains provides evidence of common
ancestry among all life. Pose a scientific question that
would need to be addressed by a valid alternative
explanation of this fact.
C. A whole-genome survey of prokaryotes (Zheng and
Wu, BMC Bioinformatics, 2010) showed that the relative
amounts of guanine and cytosine in DNA poorly predicted
the temperature range conditions that are suitable for an
organism. Refine the question posed in part B, taking this
result into acco
