which, in turn, stimulates other cells. A single postsynaptic neuron may
receive 1,000 impulses from presynaptic neurons, releasing a variety of
different neurotransmitters. All of these impulses are integrated and
summed up into either hyperpolarization (inhibited) or hypopolarization
(stimulated).
 
STUDY TIP
Cells communicate over short distances by using local regulators that target cells in the
vicinity of the emitting cell.

ORGANIZATION OF THE HUMAN BRAIN
Table 16.3 reviews the main parts of the brain. Clearly, each region
receives information from other regions, integrates that information, and
responds.
