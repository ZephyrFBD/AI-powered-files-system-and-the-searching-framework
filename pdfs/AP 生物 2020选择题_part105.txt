ypes of evidence that 
can be used to infer an 
evolutionary relationship.
Phylogeny
(A) 
Incorrect. Xylem tissue is not the only shared characteristic between 
ferns and pines.
(B) 
Incorrect. Pines have seeds and wood, but ferns do not.
(C) 
Correct. The cladogram shows that ferns and pines have two shared 
characteristics: embryos and xylem tissue.
(D) 
Incorrect. Pines and ferns share embryos and xylem, but they do not

5.C: Perform chi-square 
hypothesis testing.
EVO-1.K: Describe the 
conditions under which 
allele and genotype 
frequencies will change in 
populations.
Hardy-
Weinberg 
Equilibrium
(A) 
Correct. This is the critical value with 1 degree of freedom and a 
significance level of .05. Since this Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
question involves only 2 alleles and the frequency of 1 allele determines 
the frequency of the other allele, there is a single independent variable.
(B) 
Incorrect. This is the c
