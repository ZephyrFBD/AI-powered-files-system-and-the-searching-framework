Suppose a 200-km/h wind exerts a force of 
over
the 76.0-m-wide face (Fig. 9–80). Calculate the torque about
the potential pivot point,
the rear edge of the
building (where 
acts in
Fig. 9–80), and determine
whether the building will
topple. Assume the total
force of the wind acts at
the midpoint of the build-
ing’s face, and that the
building is not anchored
in bedrock. [Hint:
in
Fig. 9–80 represents the
force that the Earth would
exert on the building in
the case where the building
would just begin to tip.]

62. The center of gravity of a loaded truck depends on how the
truck is packed. If it is 4.0 m high and 2.4 m wide, and its
CG is 2.2 m above the
ground, how steep a slope
can the truck be parked
on without tipping over
