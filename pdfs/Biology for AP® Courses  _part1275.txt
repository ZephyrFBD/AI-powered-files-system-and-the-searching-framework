 Based on these data,
justify the claim that this interaction provides a
negative feedback loop.
C.
Explain the advantage provided to the
population and the risk to individual cells of the
timing of meiosis displayed in the graph above.
32. Construct an explanation as to how DNA is transmitted
to the next generation via meiosis followed by
fertilization.
33. In eukaryotes, sexual reproduction involves the
recombination of heritable information from both parents
via meiosis followed by fertilization. Meiosis reduces the
number of chromosomes from diploid (2n) to haploid (1n)
during the production of gametes. Meiosis begins with the
duplication of DNA, producing four strands of DNA in
two pairs of homologous chromosomes: 2(2n) becomes
4(n), that is, four haploid cells, where n is the number of
strands of DNA in a chromosome.
A. Construct an explanation of the importance of random,
independent assortment to genetic variation by creating a
diagram that represents homologous chromosomes dur
