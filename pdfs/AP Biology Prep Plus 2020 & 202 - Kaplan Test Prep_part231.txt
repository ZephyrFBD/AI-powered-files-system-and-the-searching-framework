l cafeteria could potentially infect
many other students by contaminating food with the virus. The best
advice for such a student would be to remain at home until all
symptoms subside, at which point the student would likely no longer
be infectious. Therefore, (A) is correct. (B) and (D) are incorrect
because antibiotics are only eﬀective against bacterial infections. (C) is
incorrect because over-the-counter flu medications will at best
alleviate symptoms but will not stop someone from being infectious.

Bacteria that are manipulated to target a specific problem need to be
heavily regulated due to the eﬀects they may have on non-target
populations. For example, one risk of an insulin-producing bacterial
culture is that it may infect organisms that would be adversely aﬀected
by an increase in their internal insulin concentration. Too much insulin
can lead to decreased blood sugar levels, as mentioned in (C), that can
eventually become fatal for an organism.
