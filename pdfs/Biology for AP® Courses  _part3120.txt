neurons causes many symptoms including tremor (shaking of fingers or a limb), slowed movement, speech changes, balance
and posture problems, and rigid muscles. The combination of these symptoms often causes a characteristic slow hunched

as dementia or emotional problems.
Although some patients have a form of the disease known to be caused by a single mutation, for most patients the exact
causes of Parkinson’s disease remain unknown: the disease likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental
factors (similar to Alzheimer’s disease). Post-mortem analysis of brains from Parkinson’s patients shows the presence of
Lewy bodies—abnormal protein clumps—in dopaminergic neurons. The prevalence of these Lewy bodies often
