t even low levels of radiation present some danger.
Radiation Doses
Two units are commonly used to measure exposure to radiation. The gray (Gy), the SI 
unit of absorbed dose, corresponds to the absorption of 1 J of energy per kilogram of tis-
sue. The rad (radiation absorbed dose) corresponds to the absorption of 1 * 10-2 J of 
energy per kilogram of tissue. Thus, 1 Gy = 100 rad. The rad is the unit most often used 
in medicine.
Not all forms of radiation harm biological materials to the same extent even at the 
same level of exposure. For example, 1 rad of alpha radiation can produce more damage 
than 1 rad of beta radiation. To correct for these differences, the radiation dose is multi-
plied by a factor that measures the relative damage caused by the radiation. This multipli-
cation factor is known as the relative biological effectiveness, RBE. The RBE is approximately 
1 for gamma and beta radiation, and 10 for alpha radiation.
The exact value of the RBE varies with dose rate, tot
