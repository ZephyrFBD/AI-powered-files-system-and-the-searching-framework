l, and oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the
electrical nerve impulse is transferred more efficiently. Other glial cells that are not shown support the nutritional and waste
requirements of the neuron. Some of the glial cells are phagocytic and remove debris or damaged cells from the tissue. A
nervous tissue consists of neurons and glial cells.
Figure 24.19 The neuron has projections called dendrites that receive signals and projections called axons that send
signals. Also shown are two types of glial cells: astrocytes regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell, and
oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the electrical nerve impulse is transferred more efficiently.

Why would a single layer of flat epithelial cells rather than cuboidal cells (cube-shaped) cells function more efficiently
in diffusion?
a.
As a single layer of flat epithelia are more tightly knit
