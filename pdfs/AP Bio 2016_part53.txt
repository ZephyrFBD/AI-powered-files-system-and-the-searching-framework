statements about how honeybees communicate the position of flower patches is most consistent with the model? 
(A) The number of repetitions of the waggle dance indicates the quality of the pollen source. 
(B) The total area covered by any waggle dance leads bees to the target flowers. 
(C) The angle of the waggle phase relative to the vertical plane indicates the position of the target flowers 
relative to another beehive. 
(D) The farther the target flowers from the hive, the longer the waggle phase. 
 
 
 
 
 
11. Eye pigment in a particular strain of fly is 
determined by two genes. An autosomal gene that 
controls the color of the pigments in the eye has 
two alleles: a dominant allele (R) that results in 
red eyes and a recessive allele (r) that results in 
sepia eyes. A sex-linked gene that controls the 
expression of the colored pigments also has  
two alleles: a dominant allele (T) that allows  
for expression of the colored pigments and  
a recessive allele (t) that
