Periodic Trends in Atomic Radii
Figure 7.7 shows two interesting trends:
1. Within each group, bonding atomic radius tends to increase from top to bottom. This trend 
results primarily from the increase in the principal quantum number 1n2 of the 
outer electrons. As we go down a column, the outer electrons have a greater proba-
bility of being farther from the nucleus, causing the atomic radius to increase.
2. Within each period, bonding atomic radius tends to decrease from left to right (although 
there are some minor exceptions, such as for Cl to Ar or As to Se). The major factor 
influencing this trend is the increase in effective nuclear charge Zeff across a period. 
The increasing effective nuclear charge steadily draws the valence electrons closer to 
the nucleus, causing the bonding atomic radius to decrease.
Periodic Trends in Ionic Radii
Just as bonding atomic radii can be determined from interatomic distances in molecu
