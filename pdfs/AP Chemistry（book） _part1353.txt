1.19 Å, slightly shorter 
than a typical N “O bond (see Table 8.4). Based on these 
data, which resonance structure best represents N2O?
 [8.93] (a) Triazine, C3 
H3 
N3, is like benzene except that in triazine 
every other C ¬H group is replaced by a nitrogen atom.

CHAPTER 8 Basic Concepts of Chemical Bonding
referring to Appendix C, look up the enthalpies of formation 
of acetylene and nitrogen. Which compound is more sta-
ble? (c) Write balanced chemical equations for the complete 
oxidation of N2 to form N2O51g2 and of acetylene to form 
CO21g2 and H2O1g2. (d) Calculate the enthalpy of oxidation 
per mole for N2 and for C2H2 (the enthalpy of formation 
of N2O51g2 is 11.30 kJ>mol). (e) Both N2 and C2H2 possess 
triple bonds with quite high bond enthalpies (Table 8.3). 
 
Calculate the enthalpy of hydrogenation per mole for both 
compounds: acetylene plus H2 to make methane, CH4;  
nitrogen plus H2 to make ammonia, NH3.
