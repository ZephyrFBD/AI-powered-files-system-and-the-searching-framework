P680. Electrons from
the double bonds in the head of chlorophyll a become energized
and move to a higher energy level. They are captured by a primary
electron acceptor.
PHOTOLYSIS. Photolysis is the splitting of water. It provides
electrons to replace those lost from chlorophyll a in P680.

Photolysis splits water into two electrons, two protons (H+), and
one oxygen atom. Two oxygen atoms combine to form one O2
molecule, which is released into the air as a waste product of
photosynthesis.
H2O → 2H+ + 2e− + O2 ↑
ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN. Electrons from P680 pass along an
electron transport chain consisting of several molecules including
cytochromes and several other proteins, and ultimately end up in
P700 (PS I). This flow of electrons is exergonic and provides
energy to produce ATP by chemiosmosis, the same way ATP is
produced in mitochondria. Because this ATP synthesis is powered
by light, it is called photophosphorylation. See Figur
