romosomes. Therefore, only one full set of the chromosomes is present. This is why
the cells are considered haploidâ€”there is only one chromosome set, even though each homolog still consists of two sister
chromatids. Recall that sister chromatids are merely duplicates of one of the two homologous chromosomes (except for
changes that occurred during crossing over). In meiosis II, these two sister chromatids will separate, creating four haploid
daughter cells.

Human males typically have XY chromosomes and females have XX chromosomes, but there are rare instances in
which a male can inherit an XXY or an XYY, or a female can have three X chromosomes. Explain how an error in
meiosis can cause these aberrations.

Errors can arise only during the recombination process which may result in deletions, duplications or
translocations caus
