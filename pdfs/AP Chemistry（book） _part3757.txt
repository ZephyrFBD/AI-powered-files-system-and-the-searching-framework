 tetrahedral and square- 
planar complexes, which leads to different d-orbital splitting pat-
terns. In a tetrahedral crystal-field, the splitting of the d orbitals 
results in a higher-energy t2 set and a lower-energy e set, the opposite 
of the octahedral case. The splitting in a tetrahedral crystal-field is 
much smaller than that in an octahedral crystal-field, so tetrahedral 
complexes are nearly always high-spin complexes.
Learning Outcomes After studying this chapter, you should be able to:
