ore recent common ancestor.
For example, compare a short DNA sequence from four organisms, as shown in the following table.
Comparing these sequences shows that species I and II have two nucleotide differences, species I and III have
one nucleotide difference, and species I and IV have three nucleotide differences. A possible phylogenetic tree based
on this data might look like Figure 24.3.

In this lab, you might first be asked to develop a hypothesis about the placement of a fossil on a phylogenetic tree
based on its morphology. Then four DNA sequences (like the ones in the table above) that are isolated from a fossil
are uploaded to BLAST to determine which species have DNA with the greatest degree of homology to the DNA
sequences isolated from the fossil. This additional molecular data is then used to evaluate the original hypothesis
about the placement of the fossil on the phylogenetic tree, and if supported by this molec
