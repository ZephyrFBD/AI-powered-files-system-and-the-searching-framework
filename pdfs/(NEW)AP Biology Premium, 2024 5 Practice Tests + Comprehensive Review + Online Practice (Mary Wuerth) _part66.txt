Overview
Living organisms contain more water than any other compound. The environment of most living organisms is
dominated by water. Understanding water and its properties is key for the study of life on Earth. This chapter will
review water’s unique properties and how these properties affect living organisms.
Water and the Importance of Hydrogen Bonds
Water is a polar molecule. Its polarity allows it to form hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bonds give water
properties that are essential to life on Earth.
Water contains covalent bonds (shared electrons) between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms. The element oxygen
has a high electronegativity (ability to attract electrons), while the element hydrogen has a lower electronegativity.
Because of this electronegativity difference, the electrons in the covalent bond between oxygen
