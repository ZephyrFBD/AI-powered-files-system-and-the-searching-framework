4. (II) According to a simplified model of a mammalian heart,
at each pulse approximately 20 g of blood is accelerated
from 
to 
during a period of 0.10 s. What 
is the magnitude of the force exerted by the heart muscle?
5. (II) Superman must stop a 
train in 150 m to keep
it from hitting a stalled car on the tracks. If the train’s mass
is
how much force must he exert? Compare
to the weight of the train (give as %). How much force
does the train exert on Superman?
6. (II) A person has a reasonable chance of surviving an auto-
mobile crash if the deceleration is no more than 30 g’s.
Calculate the force on a 65-kg person accelerating at this
rate. What distance is traveled if brought to rest at this rate
from
7. (II) What average force is required to stop a 950-kg car in
8.0 s if the car is traveling at 
8. (II) Estimate the average force exerted by a shot-putter on
a 7.0-kg shot if the shot is moved through a distance of
2.8 m and is released with a speed o
