ds. Oxygen has eight electrons 
of which four form a spherically
symmetric core and the other four could have, for example, a doughnut-shaped
distribution. The barbell-shaped distribution on the z axis (like that shown
dashed in Fig. 29–5) could be empty, so electrons from hydrogen atoms can be
attracted by a net charge of 
They are also attracted by the H nuclei, so they
partly orbit the H atoms as well as the O atom. The net effect is that there is a net
positive charge on each H atom (less than 
), because the electrons spend only
part of their time there. And, there is a net negative charge on the O atom.
29–2 Potential-Energy Diagrams
for Molecules
It is useful to analyze the interaction between two objects—say, between two
atoms or molecules—with the use of a potential-energy diagram, which is a plot
of the potential energy versus the separation distance.
For the simple case of two point charges,
and 
the potential energy PE is
given by (we combine Eqs. 17–2a and 17–5)
