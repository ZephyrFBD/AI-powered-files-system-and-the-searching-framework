The diagram above is a pedigree of three generations showing the occurrence of two genetically transmitted
diseases. Phenotypes of affected individuals are shown. Circles represent females, and squares represent males.
Assume that the diseases are rare, unlinked, and that individuals not blood related to I-a and I-b (“in-laws”) do

(a) Explain how it is possible for a person to have two rare unlinked genetic diseases at the same time.
(b) Calculate the ratios of affected males and affected females for Disease 2.
(c) Identify t
