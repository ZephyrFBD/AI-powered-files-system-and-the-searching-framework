*15–3 Human Metabolism
*14. (I) How much energy would the person of Example 15–7
transform if instead of working 11.0 h she took a noontime
break and ran at 
for 1.0 h?
*15. (I) Calculate the average metabolic rate of a 65-kg person who
sleeps 8.0 h, sits at a desk 6.0 h, engages in light activity 6.0 h,
watches TV 2.0 h, plays tennis 1.5 h, and runs 0.50 h daily.
*16. (II) A 65-kg person decides to lose weight by sleeping one
hour less per day, using the time for light activity. How much
weight (or mass) can this person expect to lose in 1 year,
assuming no change in food intake? Assume that 1 kg of
fat stores about 40,000 kJ of energy.
*17. (II) (a) How much energy is transformed by a typical 65-kg
person who runs at 
for 
in one week
(Table 15–2)? (b) How many
