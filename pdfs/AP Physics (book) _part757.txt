space and essentially in a vacuum?
24. Bob and Jim decide to play tug-of-war on a frictionless
(icy) surface. Jim is considerably stronger than Bob, but
Bob weighs 160 lb whereas Jim weighs 145 lb. Who loses
by crossing over the midline first? Explain.
25. In one type of nuclear radioactive decay, an electron and a
recoil nucleus are emitted but often do not separate along
the same line. Use conservation of momentum in two
dimensions to explain why this implies the emission of at
least one other particle (it came to be called a “neutrino”).
26. Show on a diagram how your CM shifts when you move
from a lying position to a sitting position.
27. If only an external force can change the momentum of the
center of mass of an object, how can the internal force 
of the engine accelerate a car?
28. A rocket following a parabolic path through the air sud-
denly explodes into many pieces. What can you say about
the motion of this system of pieces?
