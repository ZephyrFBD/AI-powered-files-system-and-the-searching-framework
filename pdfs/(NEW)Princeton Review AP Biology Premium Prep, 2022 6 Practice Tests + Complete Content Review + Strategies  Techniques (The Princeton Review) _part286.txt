cells?
As we’ve said, an offspring has one set of chromosomes from each of its parents. A parent, therefore, contributes a
gamete with one set that will be paired with the set from the other parent to produce a new diploid cell, or zygote.
This produces offspring that are a combination of their parents.
GREGOR MENDEL: THE FATHER OF GENETICS
What is genetics? In its simplest form, genetics is the study of heredity. It explains how certain characteristics are
passed on from parents to children. Much of what we know about genetics was discovered by the monk Gregor
Mendel in the 19th century. Since then, the field of genetics has vastly expanded.
Let’s begin then with some of the fundamental points of genetics:
Traits—or expressed characteristics—are influenced by one or more of your genes. Remember, a gene is
simply a chunk of DNA that codes for a particular recipe. Different recipes affect different traits. DNA is passed
from generation to generation, and from this process the genes and
