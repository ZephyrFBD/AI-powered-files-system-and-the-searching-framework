The potential energy is negative, meaning 0.12 eV of work (or energy input) is
required to separate the dipoles. That is, the binding energy of this “weak” or
hydrogen bond is 0.12 eV. This is only an estimate, of course, since other
charges in the vicinity would have an influence too.

Protein Synthesis
Weak bonds, especially hydrogen bonds, are crucial to the process of protein
synthesis. Proteins serve as structural par
