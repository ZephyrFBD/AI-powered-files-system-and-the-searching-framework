Figure 4.15 The centrosome consists of two centrioles that lie at right angles to each other. Each centriole is a cylinder
made up of nine triplets of microtubules. Nontubulin proteins (indicated by the green lines) hold the microtubule triplets
together.
The centrosome (the organelle where all microtubules originate) replicates itself before a cell divides, and the centrioles
appear to have some role in pulling the duplicated chromosomes to opposite ends of the dividing cell. However, the exact
function of the centrioles in cell division isn’t clear, because cells that have had the centrosome removed can still divide,
and plant cells, which lack centrosomes, are capable of cell division.
Lysosomes
Animal cells have another set of organelles not found in most plant cells: lysosomes. The lysosomes are the cell’s “garbage
disposal.” In plant cells, the digestive processes tak
