to carry out all life functions. The laws of thermodynamics govern all
energy transformations. The first law of thermodynamics states that
energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to
another. For example, plants convert light energy to chemical energy
during photosynthesis. This law is also known as the law of conservation
of energy. The second law of thermodynamics states that during energy
conversions, the universe becomes more disordered. In other words,
entropy increases. We can determine how much free energy is available to
do work within a cell by calculating the Gibb’s free energy, or just free
energy, represented by the letter G. During the course of a reaction, if
energy is released, the reaction is said to be exergonic or exothermic and
ΔG is < 0 (negative). If ΔG < 0, the reaction is spontaneous. If in a
chemical reaction energy is absorbed, the reaction is endergonic or
endothermic and ΔG is > 0 (positive). In complex cellular react
