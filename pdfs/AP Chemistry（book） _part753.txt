heat stroke. However, replenishing water without replenishing the elec-
trolytes lost during perspiration can also lead to serious problems. If the 
normal blood sodium level drops too low, dizziness and confusion set 
in, and the condition can become critical. Drinking a sport drink that 
contains some electrolytes helps to prevent this problem.
When body temperature drops too low, blood flow to the skin sur-
face decreases, thereby decreasing heat loss. The lower temperature also 
triggers small involuntary contractions of the muscles (shivering); the 
biochemical reactions that generate the energy to do this work also gen-
erate heat for the body. If the body is unable to maintain a normal tem-
perature, the very dangerous condition called hypothermia can result.
