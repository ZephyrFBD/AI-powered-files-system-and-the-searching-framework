 MnO4
- (permanga-
nate ion) (see Exercise 23.84), what can you say about 
how the energy separation between the ligand orbitals 
and the empty d orbitals changes as a function of the 
oxidation state of the transition metal at the center of 
the tetrahedral anion?
 [23.86]  The red color of ruby is due to the presence of Cr(III) ions at 
octahedral sites in the close-packed oxide lattice of Al2O3. 
Draw the crystal-field splitting diagram for Cr(III) in this 
environment. Suppose that the ruby crystal is subjected to 
high pressure. What do you predict for the variation in the 
wavelength of absorption of the ruby as a function of pres-
sure? Explain.
 23.87  In 2001, chemists at SUNY-Stony Brook succeeded in syn-
thesizing the complex trans@3Fe(CN)4(CO)242-, which 
could be a model of complexes that may have played a role 
in the origin of life. (a) Sketch the structure of the complex. 
(b) The complex is isolated as a sodium salt. Write the com-
plete name of this salt. (c) What is
