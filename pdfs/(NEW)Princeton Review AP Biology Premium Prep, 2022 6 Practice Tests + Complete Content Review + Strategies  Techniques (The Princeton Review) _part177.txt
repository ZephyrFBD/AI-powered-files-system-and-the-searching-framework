 A radioactive isotope of hydrogen, 3H, is called tritium. Tritium differs from the more common form of
hydrogen because
(A) it contains two neutrons and one proton in its nucleus
(B) it contains one neutron and two protons in its nucleus
(C) it differs by its atomic number
(D) it is radioactive and therefore gives off one electron
Summary
Compounds are composed of two or more types of elements in a fixed ratio.
Molecules are held together by ionic bonds and covalent bonds.
Hydrogen bonding is essential for the following emergent properties of water:
cohesion
adhesion
surface tension
high heat capacity
expansion on freezing
polar structure
ability to dissolve other polar (hydrophilic) substances but inability to dissolve nonpolar (hydrophobic)
substances
pH is important for biological reactions. Solutions may be acidic, basic or alkaline, or neutral.
Organic molecules contain carbon atoms. Many molecules in biology are composed of several monomers bound
together into polymers. The crea
