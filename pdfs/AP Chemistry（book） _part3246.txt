ucts adhere to the electrodes, which 
permits the electrode reactions to be reversed during charging. A single nicad voltaic cell 
has a voltage of 1.30 V. Nicad battery packs typically contain three or more cells in series 
to produce the higher voltages needed by most electronic devices.
Although nickel–cadmium batteries have a number of attractive characteristics, 
the use of cadmium as the anode introduces significant limitations. Because cadmium 
is toxic, these batteries must be recycled. The toxicity of cadmium has led to a decline in 
their popularity from a peak annual production level of approximately 1.5 billion bat-
teries in the early 2000s. Cadmium also has a relatively high density, which increases 
battery weight, an undesirable characteristic for use in portable devices and electric 
vehicles. These shortcomings have fueled the development of the nickel–metal hydride 
(NiMH) battery. The cathode reaction is the same as that for nickel–cadmium batteries, 
but the anode
