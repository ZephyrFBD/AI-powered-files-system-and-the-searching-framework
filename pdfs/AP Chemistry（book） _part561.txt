e chemical formulas of the reactants and products and 
then determine which product is insoluble. We then write and balance 
the molecular equation. Next, we write each soluble strong electrolyte 
as separated ions to obtain the complete ionic equation. Finally, we 
eliminate the spectator ions to obtain the net ionic equation.
Solve Calcium chloride is composed of calcium ions, Ca2+, and 
chloride ions, Cl-; hence, an aqueous solution of the substance is 
CaCl21aq2. Sodium carbonate is composed of Na+ ions and CO3
2- 
ions; hence, an aqueous solution of the compound is Na2CO31aq2. 
In the molecular equations for precipitation reactions, the anions 
and cations appear to exchange partners. Thus, we put Ca2+ and 
CO3
2- together to give CaCO3 and Na+ and Cl- together to give 
NaCl. According to the solubility guidelines in Table 4.1, CaCO3 is 
insoluble and NaCl is soluble. The balanced molecular equation is
CaCl21aq2 + Na2CO31aq2 ยก CaCO31s2 + 2 NaCl1aq2
In a complete ionic equation, on
