roxide reacts with either acid or 
base varies with the particular metal ion involved. Many metal hydroxidesâ€”such as 
Ca1OH22, Fe1OH22, and Fe1OH23:are capable of dissolving in acidic solution but do not 
react with excess base. These hydroxides are not amphoteric.
The purification of aluminum ore in the manufacture of aluminum metal pro-
vides an interesting application of amphoterism. As we have seen, Al1OH23 is ampho-
teric, whereas Fe1OH23 is not. Aluminum occurs in large quantities as the ore bauxite, 
which is essentially hydrated Al2O3 contaminated with Fe2O3. When bauxite is added to 
a strongly basic solution, the Al2O3 dissolves because the aluminum forms complex ions, 
such as Al1OH24
-. The Fe2O3 impurity, however, is not amphoteric and remains as a solid. 
The solution is filtered, getting rid of the iron impurity. Aluminum hydroxide is then 
precipitated by addition of acid. The purified hydroxide receives further treatment and 
eventually yields aluminum metal.
