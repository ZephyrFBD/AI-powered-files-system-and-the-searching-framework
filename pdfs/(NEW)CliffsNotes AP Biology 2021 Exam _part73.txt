sisting of
repeating units of glucose. Protein is a polymer of amino acids.
5. C. The activation energy is given by X + Y for curve A or Y for curve B. Curve B shows how the activation
energy would be lowered if an enzyme were present. Since the products (right side of the curve) have less energy
than the reactants, energy is released. This kind of reaction, where energy is released, is called an exergonic reaction.
If the products had more energy than the reactants, it would be an endergonic reaction. The reaction ATP â†’ ADP +
Pi is an exergonic reaction where the
energy released is used as activation energy for other metabolic reactions.
6. A. This is the ring structure of glucose.
7. B. This is amylose, a starch found in plants.
8. D. This polypeptide contains five amino acids.
9. C. This is a phospholipid. Note that this phospholipid contains one saturated and one monounsaturated fatty acid.
10. D. Long hydrocarbon chains are nonpolar and, therefore, hydrophobic. Any polar molecule
