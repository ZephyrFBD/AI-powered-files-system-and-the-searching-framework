(deoxyribose or ribose), a nitrogenous base (adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, or uracil), and a phosphate group.
Nucleotides have directionality in that the phosphate group is always attached to the 5′ carbon in the sugar, and the
3′ carbon always has a hydroxyl group to which new nucleotides may be added.
Figure 4.7 Nucleotides
While DNA and RNA are both made of nucleotides, their structures differ. Unit 6 of this book will review how
these structural differences relate to their different functions. Table 4.1 summarizes some quick initial facts to know
about DNA and RNA.

RNA
Five-Carbon Sugar
Deoxyribose
Ribose
Nitrogenous Bases
Adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine
Adenine, uracil, cytosine, and guanine
Strands
Double-stranded helix
Usually single-stranded but can form three-
dimensional structures when folded

Transcribes and regulates the expression of
genetic information
Location
Usually found in the nucleus
