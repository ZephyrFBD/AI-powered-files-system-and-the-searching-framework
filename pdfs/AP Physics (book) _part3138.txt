minism. For example, quantum mechanics predicts a finite (but negligibly small)
probability that when you throw a stone, its path might suddenly curve upward
instead of following the downward-curved parabola of normal projectile motion.
Quantum mechanics predicts with extremely high probability that ordinary objects
will behave just as the classical laws of physics predict. But these predictions are
considered probabilities, not absolute certainties. The reason that macroscopic
objects behave in accordance with classical laws with such high probability is due
to the large number of molecules involved: when large numbers of objects are
present in a statistical situation, deviations from the average (or most probable)
approach zero. It is the average configuration of vast numbers of molecules that
follows the so-called fixed laws of classical physics with such high probability,
and gives rise to an apparent “determinism.” Deviations from classical laws are
observed when small
