iosis, resulting in different effects.
B. Mutations in somatic cells and germ cells can lead to the formation of cancer.

Mutations: Causes, Types, and Consequences
A. Mutations during DNA Replication—mutations of one or a few nucleotides in DNA are called point
mutations and usually occur during DNA replication.
1. Substitution mutations—occur when a nucleotide has been altered or incorrectly paired during DNA
synthesis, thereby changing it to another nucleotide.
i.
Substitution that occurs within a coding region of a gene may or may not cause a change in the
amino acid in that position of the protein.
ii. Some substitutions can result in detrimental effects, such as changes in blood protein hemoglobin
that result in sickle cell anemia disease.
2. Insertion or deletion point mutations—occur when one or a few nucleotides are inserted or deleted.
i.
Insertion or deletion of groups of three nucleotides within a coding region of a gene may simply
cause insertion or deletion of amino ac
