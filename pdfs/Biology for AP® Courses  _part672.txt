tinction must be
drawn between the term spontaneous and the idea of a chemical reaction that occurs immediately. Contrary to the everyday
use of the term, a spontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly occurs. The rusting of iron is an example of a
spontaneous reaction that occurs slowly, little by little, over time.
If a chemical reaction requires an input of energy rather than releasing energy, then the ∆G for that reaction will be a
positive value. In this case, the products have more free energy than the reactants. Thus, the products of these reactions can
be thought of as energy-storing molecules. These chemical reactions are called endergonic reactions, and they are non-
spontaneous. An endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without the addition of free energy.
Let’s revisit the example of the synthesis and breakdown of the food molecule, glucose. Remember that the building of
complex molecules, such as sugars, from simpler ones is an anabolic process and
