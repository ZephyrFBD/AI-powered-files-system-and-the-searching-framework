 holding
molecules together. To carry out the processes necessary for life, cells must find a way to release the energy in these
bonds when they need it and store it away when they don’t. The study of how cells accomplish this is called
bioenergetics. Generally, bioenergetics is the study of how energy from the sun is transformed into energy in living
things.
During chemical reactions, such bonds are either broken or formed. This process involves energy, no matter which
direction we go. Every chemical reaction involves a change in energy.
Thermodynamics
We’ve all heard the expression “nothing in life is free.” The same holds true in nature.
Energy cannot be created or destroyed. In other words, the sum of energy in the universe is
constant.
This rule is called the First Law of Thermodynamics. As a result, the cell cannot take energy out of thin air.
Rather, it must harvest it from somewhere.
The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that energy transfer leads to less organization. That m
