DNA
primer which is used by RNA polymerase to
form a parent strand. If helicase is mutated, the
DNA strands will be separated at the beginning
of replication.
45. What are Okazaki fragments and how they are formed?
a.
Okazaki fragments are short stretches of DNA
on the lagging strand, which is synthesized in
the direction away from the replication fork.
b.
Okazaki fragments are long stretches of DNA on
the lagging strand, which is synthesized in the
direction of the replication fork.
c.
Okazaki fragments are long stretches of DNA on
the leading strand, which is synthesized in the
direction away from the replication fork.
d.
Okazaki fragments are short stretches of DNA
on the leading strand, which is synthesized in the
direction of the replication fork.
46. Compare and contrast the roles of DNA polymerase I
and DNA ligase in DNA replication.
a.
DNA polymerase I removes the RNA primers
from the developing copy of DNA. DNA ligase
seals the ends of the new segment, especially the
Okazaki f
