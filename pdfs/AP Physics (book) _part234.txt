This snowboarder flying through 
the air shows an example of 
motion in two dimensions. In 
the absence of air resistance, the
path would be a perfect parabola.
The gold arrow represents the 
downward acceleration of 
gravity,
Galileo analyzed the
motion of objects in 2 dimensions
under the action of gravity near 
the Earth’s surface (now called 
“projectile motion”) into its 
horizontal and vertical components.
We will discuss vectors and how 
to add them. Besides analyzing 
projectile motion, we will also see
how to work with relative velocity.
