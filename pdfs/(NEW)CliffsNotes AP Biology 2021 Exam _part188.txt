 to a specific ligand, that is, a molecular signal. There are also voltage-gated-ion receptors
that open or close in response to voltage differences across the membrane. A typical ligand-gated ion sequence
follows (Figure 6-2a):
1. Ligand-gated ion receptor receives signal. A specific messenger ligand binds to the outward-facing surface of
the receptor.
2. Receptor channel opens and ions pass through. In response to the binding of the ligand, the threedimensional
shape of the receptor changes, opening (or closing) a channel that allows a specific ion to pass through and enter the
cytoplasm.
3. Ions initiate chemical response. Once in the cytoplasm, the ions initiate a chemical response.
4. Ligand-gated ion receptor deactivated when ligand detaches from receptor. The ligand-ion receptor is
deactivated when the messenger ligand is broken down by another enzyme, the binding site for the ligand is blocked
by an allosteric ligand, or the ion passage is obstructed by a channel blocker.
