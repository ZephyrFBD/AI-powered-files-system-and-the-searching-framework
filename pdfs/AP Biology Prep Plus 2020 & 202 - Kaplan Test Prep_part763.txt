heir descendants, so it would be present in three
additional clades (actinopterygians, Guiyu-lineage, and
sarcopterygians). Even though characteristics are oȇen secondarily
lost in descendants as species evolve, the question stem says to
assume the simplest explanation, in which case it would be likely that
all three clades share the unique characteristic.

Learning Objective: 17.2
Organisms are placed on a cladogram based on evolutionary
relationships rather than by appearance. Hence, all of the organisms
that share a recent common ancestor are relatively closely related,
evolutionarily, even if some appear quite diﬀerent. The correct answer
is (C). (A) is incorrect because cladograms sometimes include
information about timescales. but not always, and this is not the most
likely explanation. (B) is incorrect because all of the organisms
originate at a single node in every cladogram, which represents their
common ancestor. (D) is incorrect because, even though organisms
that are c
