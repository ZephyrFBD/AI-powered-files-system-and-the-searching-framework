parated
on a gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and incubated with a DNA probe complementary to the sequence of
interest. Northern blotting is similar to Southern blotting, but RNA is run on the gel instead of DNA. In western blotting,
proteins are run on a gel and detected using antibodies.

Molecular Cloning
In general, the word “cloning” means the creation of a perfect replica; however, in biology, the re-creation of a whole
organism is referred to as “reproductive cloning.” Long before attempts were made to clone an entire organism, researchers
learned how to reproduce desired regions or fragments of the genome, a process that is referred to as molecular cloning.
Cloning small fragments of the genome allows for the manipulation and study of specific genes (and their protein products),
or noncoding regions in isolation. A plasmid (also called a vector) is a small circular DNA molecule that replicates
independently of the chromosomal DNA.
