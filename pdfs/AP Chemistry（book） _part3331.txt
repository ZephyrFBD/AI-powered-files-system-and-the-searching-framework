The density of chromium metal is 7.20 g>cm3. (b) What 
current ï¬‚ow is required for this electroplating if the bumper 
is to be plated in 10.0 s? (c) If the external source has an 
emf of +6.0 V and the electrolytic cell is 65% efficient, 
how much electrical power is expended to electroplate the 
bumper?
 20.108  Magnesium is obtained by electrolysis of molten MgCl2.  
(a) Why is an aqueous solution of MgCl2 not used in the 
electrolysis? (b) Several cells are connected in parallel by 
very large copper bars that convey current to the cells. 
Assuming that the cells are 96% efficient in producing the 
desired products in electrolysis, what mass of Mg is formed 
by passing a current of 97,000 A for a period of 24 h?
 20.109  Calculate the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity 
required to produce 1.0 * 103 kg (1 metric ton) of alumi-
num by electrolysis of Al3+ if the applied voltage is 4.50 V 
and the process is 45% effici
