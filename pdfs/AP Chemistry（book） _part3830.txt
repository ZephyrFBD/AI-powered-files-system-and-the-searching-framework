an oxyacetylene torch, the flame reaches about 3200 K. Because alkynes in gen-
eral are highly reactive, they are not as widely distributed in nature as alkenes; alkynes, however, are 
important intermediates in many industrial processes.
Alkynes are named by identifying the longest continuous chain containing the triple bond and 
modifying the ending of the name of the corresponding alkane from -ane to -yne, as shown in Sample 
Exercise 24.4.

Sample Exercise 24.4 
Naming Unsaturated Hydrocarbons
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the condensed structural formulas for an 
alkene and an alkyne and asked to name the compounds.
Plan In each case, the name is based on the number of carbon atoms 
in the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the multiple 
bond. In the alkene, care must be taken to indicate whether cisâ€“
trans isomerism is possible and, if so, which isomer is given.
