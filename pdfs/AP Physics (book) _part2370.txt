more emf in the inductor (I is no longer changing) so all the voltage drop is across
the resistance. The shape of the curve for I as a function of time is

Next, if the battery is suddenly switched out of the circuit (dashed line in
Fig. 21–37), it takes time for the current to drop to zero, as shown in Fig. 21–38b.
This is an exponential decay curve given by
The time constant is the time for the current to decrease to 
(37% of the
original value), and again equals 
These graphs show that there is always some “lag time” or “reaction time”
when an electromagnet, for example, is turned on or off. We also see that an 
LR circuit has properties similar to an RC circuit (Section 19–6). Unlike the
capacitor case, however, the time constant here is inversely proportional to R.
