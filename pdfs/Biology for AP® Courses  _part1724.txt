by haploid
cells, each with a single set of unpaired chromosomes. The
cell propagates asexually, and the genetic material is
replicated through mitosis. Cell division occurs every 2–4
hours, leading to 60–100 generations in a single day. Yeast
also reproduce sexually, particularly under adverse
environmental conditions. When two haploid cells—with
DNA containing complementary mating-type
alleles—conjugate, a diploid zygote results. The diploid
zygote can then complete the sexual segment of the life
cycle through meiosis. After meiosis, four haploid spores
are produced, which can germinate.
Researchers can grow yeast easily on nutrient-containing
plates. Because both asexual and sexual reproduction is
rapid, yeast has become an important organism for the
experimental investigation of mutagenesis and evolution
among eukaryotes. Environmental factors, such as
chemicals or radiation, induce mutations. High-energy
UV-c radiation of less than 1 minute in duration will result
in many mutated
