anscription in Eukaryotes
Unlike the prokaryotic polymerase that can bind to a DNA template on its own, eukaryotes require several other proteins,
called transcription factors, to first bind to the promoter region and then help recruit the appropriate polymerase.
The Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases
The features of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis are markedly more complex those of prokaryotes. Instead of a single
polymerase comprising five subunits, the eukaryotes have three polymerases that are each made up of 10 subunits or more.
Each eukaryotic polymerase also requires a distinct set of transcription factors to bring it to the DNA template.
RNA polymerase I is located in the nucleolus, a specialized nuclear substructure in which ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is
