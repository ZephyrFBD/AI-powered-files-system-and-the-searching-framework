can be sectioned in order to view internal structures: a sagittal section cuts the brain left to right, as shown in Figure 26.21b,
a coronal section cuts the brain front to back, as shown in Figure 26.20a, and a horizontal section cuts the brain top to
bottom.
Cerebral Cortex
The outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex, which is folded into hills
called gyri (singular: gyrus) and valleys called sulci (singular: sulcus). The cortex is made up of two hemispheres—right
and left—which are separated by a large sulcus. A thick fiber bundle called the corpus callosum (Latin: “tough body”)
connects the two hemispheres and allows information to be passed from one side to the other. Although there are some

brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the other, the functions of the two hemispheres are largely
redundant. In fact, sometimes (very rarely) an entire hemisphere is removed t
