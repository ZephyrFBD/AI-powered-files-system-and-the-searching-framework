MITOSIS
Mitosis consists of the actual dividing of the nucleus. It is a remarkable
process because the DNA is passed from one generation to the next with
great fidelity. It is a continuous process. However, scientists have divided
it into four arbitrary phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and
telophase. Here are the characteristics of each phase. Figure 4.4 shows
each of these phases.
STUDY TIP
Although the College Board does not require you to know the names of specific phases, you
may find this information useful in understanding the process of mitosis.
Prophase
The nuclear membrane begins to disintegrate.
The strands of chromosomes begin to condense into discrete
observable structures, like that in Figure 4.1 on page 68.
The nucleolus disappears.
In the cytoplasm, the mitotic spindle begins to form, extending
from one centrosome to the other.
Metaphase
The chromosomes line up in a single file located
