ic energy as one composed of more massive particles, such as Xe. 
The mass of the particles in the He sample is smaller than that in the Xe sample. Conse-
quently, the He particles must have a higher rms speed than the Xe particles. The equa-
tion that expresses this fact quantitatively is
 
urms = A
3RT
ℳ 
[10.20]
where ℳ is the molar mass of the particles, which can be derived from the kinetic-molecular 
 
theory. Because ℳ appears in the denominator, the less massive the gas particles, the 
higher their rms speed.
Figure 10.13 shows the distribution of molecular speeds for several gases at 25 °C. 
Notice how the distributions are shifted toward higher speeds for gases of lower molar 
masses.
The most probable speed of a gas molecule can also be derived:
 
ump = A

Applying the Kinetic-Molecular Theory
