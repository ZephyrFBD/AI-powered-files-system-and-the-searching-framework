p2 is the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype.
2pq is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype.
q2 is the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype.
Water Equations
The total water potential is the sum of the pressure potential and the solute potential:
In open containers in equilibrium with their environment:
Solute potential can be calculated with the following equation:
i = ionization constant for the solute
C = concentration of the solute in moles per liter
R = pressure constant 
T = temperature in Kelvin (Note: Kelvin = °C + 273)
pH balance is vital to living organisms and can be calculated with the following equation:
Equations Related to Ecology
Greater biodiversity can help ecosystems withstand disruptions (environmental changes). One way to measure the
biodiversity of an ecosystem is by using the Simpson’s Diversity Index:
N = the total number of organisms of all species in an entire ecosystem
n = the total number of organisms of one particular species in an e
