 vectors) are
drawn in an xy coordinate system to represent each voltage. The length of each
arrow represents the magnitude of the peak voltage across each element:
(21;13b)
is in phase with the current and is initially 
drawn along the positive
x axis, as is the current 
leads the current by 90°, so it leads 
by 90° and 
is initially drawn along the positive y axis.
lags the current by 90°, so 
is
drawn initially along the negative y axis. See Fig. 21–44a. If we let the vector
diagram rotate counterclockwise at frequency f, we get the diagram shown in
Fig. 21–44b; after a time, , each arrow has rotated through an angle 
Then
the projections of each arrow on the x axis represent the voltages across each
element at the instant , as can be seen in Fig. 21–44c. For example 
The sum of the projections of the three voltage vectors represents the instanta-
neous voltage across the whole circuit, V. Therefore, the vector sum of these
vectors will be the vector that represents the peak source
