*29–9 Diodes
24. (I) At what wavelength will an LED radiate if made from a
material with an energy gap
25. (I) If an LED emits light of wavelength 
what
is the energy gap (in eV) between valence and conduction
bands?
26. (I) A semiconductor diode laser emits 
light.
Assuming that the light comes from electrons and holes
recombining, what is the band gap in this laser material?
27. (II) A silicon diode, whose current–voltage characteristics
are given in Fig. 29–30, is connected in series with a battery
and a 
resistor. What battery voltage is needed to
produce a 14-mA current?
28. (II) An ac voltage of 120-V rms is to be rectified. Estimate
very roughly the average current in the output resistor R
for (a) a half-wave rectifier (Fig. 29–31), and 
(b) a full-wave rectifier (Fig. 29–32) without capacitor.
29. (III) Suppose that the diode of Fig. 29–30 is connecte
