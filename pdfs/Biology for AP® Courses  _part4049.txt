s develop into female sexual tissues. Primitive gonads become testes or ovaries. Tissues that
produce a penis in males produce a clitoris in females. The tissue that will become the scrotum in a male becomes the labia
in a female; that is, they are homologous structures.
Male Reproductive Anatomy
In the male reproductive system, the scrotum houses the testicles or testes (singular: testis), including providing passage
for blood vessels, nerves, and muscles related to testicular function. The testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that
produce sperm and some reproductive hormones. Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm (1.5 by 1 in) in size and divided
into wedge-shaped lobules by connective tissue called septa. Coiled in each wedge are seminiferous tubules that produce
sperm.
Sperm are immobile at body temperature; therefore, the scrotum and penis are external to the body, as illustrated in Figure
34.10 so that a proper temperature is maintained for motility. In land mammals
