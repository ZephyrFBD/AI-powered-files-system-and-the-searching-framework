ce (D) is incorrect because 
 of the offspring are expected to be round and  are
expected to be constricted, so some of the offspring must be both round and constricted and thus the answer
cannot be 0.
6. (B) The genotypes of the plants described in the problem are RrSs and Rrss. First, calculate the probability for
each trait separately. The probability of two plants that are heterozygous for round peas producing an offspring
with round peas is . The probability of a plant with heterozygous smooth pods crossed with a plant with
constricted pods producing an offspring with constricted pods is . Multiplying the two probabilities together
gives the probability of a plant with both round peas and constricted pods: 
.
7. (B) A person who is heterozygous for polydactyly would have the Ff genotype. A person with the typical
number of fingers and toes would have the ff genotype, so the chances their first child will have polydactyly is
50%. (Whether this is their first child, second child, et
