as a result of the diverse metabolic activities of
the organisms living there, but they provide benefits to human food production, drinking water availability, and breathable
air.
Other key ecosystem services related to food production are plant pollination and crop pest control. Over 150 crops in the
United States require pollination to produce. One estimate of the benefit of honeybee pollination within the United States is
$1.6 billion per year; other pollinators contribute up to $6.7 billion more.
Many honeybee populations are managed by apiarists who rent out their hivesâ€™ services to farmers. Honeybee populations
in North America have been suffering large losses caused by a syndrome known as colony collapse disorder, whose cause
is unclear. Other pollinators include a diverse array of other bee species and various insects and birds. Loss of these species
would make growing crops requiring pollination impossible, increasing dependence on other crops.
Finally, humans compete for thei
