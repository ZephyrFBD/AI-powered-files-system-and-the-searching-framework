 2pq. So p2 + 2pq = (0.4)2 + (2)
(0.4)(0.6) = 0.16 + 0.48 =
 
0.64 = 64%.
46. B. For the 10-year period from 1965 to 1975, there was a dramatic shift in the frequency of p and q. When p
became 0, q became fixed at 1.0. Selection (perhaps a disease) against the black phenotype (both BB and Bb
phenotypes) is the most likely cause. Genetic drift is usually significant only in small populations (this is a large
population), and a sudden bottleneck resulting from some catastrophic event would not likely have eliminated all the
black beetles. Similarly, gene flow through emigration can be eliminated as the correct answer, as it is extremely
unlikely that only brown beetles remained while all black beetles emigrated.
47. D. The change in p from 1985 to 1990 can best be explained by gene flow. Immigrants carrying the dominant
allele, B, entered the population. This implies that the selection pressure against the blackcolored beetles (perhaps a
disease) was removed sometime between 1975 and 198
