Laws of Probability 
If A and B are 
 
mutually exclusive, then: 
P(A and B) = P(A) ¥  P(B) 
Hardy-Weinberg Equations 
p + q = 1 
x = sample mean  
n  
 
 
= size of the sample 
s = sample standard deviation (i.e., the sample-based 
estimate of the standard deviation of the 
population)  
o = observed results
e = expected results
Degree
 
 
 
 
 
s of freedom are equal to the number of 
distinct possible outcom
 
 
 
 
es minus one. 
Mode = value that occurs most frequently in a data set 
Median = middle value that separates the greater and lesser halves of a data set 
Mean = sum of all data points divided by number of data points 
Range = value obtained by subtracting the smallest observation (sample minimum) from the greatest (sample maximum)
