Gas pipelines are used to deliver natural gas (methane, 
CH4) to the various regions of the United States. The to-
tal volume of natural gas that is delivered is on the order 
of 2.7 * 1012 L per day, measured at STP
. Calculate the 
total enthalpy change for combustion of this quantity of 
methane. (Note: Less than this amount of methane is ac-
tually combusted daily. Some of the delivered gas is passed 
through to other regions.)

Chlorine dioxide gas 1ClO22 is used as a commercial bleach-
ing agent. It bleaches materials by oxidizing them. In the 
course of these reactions, the ClO2 is itself reduced. (a) 
What is the Lewis structure for ClO2?  (b) Why do you think 
that ClO2 is reduced so readily? (c) When a ClO2 molecule 
gains an electron, the chlorite ion,
