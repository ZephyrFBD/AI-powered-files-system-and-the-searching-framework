67. A mole of carbon contains 
electrons. Two
electrically neutral carbon spheres, each containing 1 mole
of carbon, are separated by 15.0 cm (center to center).
What fraction of electrons would have to be transferred
from one sphere to the other for the electric force and the
gravitational force between the spheres to be equal?
7.22 * 1024
4. What experimental observations mentioned in the text rule
out the possibility that the numerator in Coulomb’s law
contains the sum 
rather than the product
