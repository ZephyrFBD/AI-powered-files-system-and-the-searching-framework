drinking water and swimming pools because the HOCl1aq2
that is generated serves as a disinfectant.
The halogens react directly with most metals to form ionic halides. The halogens 
also react with hydrogen to form gaseous hydrogen halide compounds:
 
H21g2 + X2 ยก 2 HX1g2 
[7.34]
These compounds are all very soluble in water and dissolve to form the hydrohalic acids. 
As we discussed in Section 4.3, HCl1aq2, HBr1aq2, and HI1aq2 are strong acids, whereas 
HF1aq2 is a weak acid.

Why are more molecules of I2 seen in the molecular view relative to the 
number of Cl2 molecules?

Give It Some Thought
Can you use data in Table 7.7 to estimate the atomic radius and first ionization 
energy of an astatine atom?
Group 8A: The Noble Gases
The group 8A elements, known as the noble gases, are all nonmetals that are gases at 
room temperature. They are all monatomic (that is, they consist of single atoms rather
