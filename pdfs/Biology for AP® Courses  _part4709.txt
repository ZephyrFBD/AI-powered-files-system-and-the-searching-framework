48. Why does this figure show a higher value of gross
productivity for the decomposers than the tertiary
consumers?
a.
Due to the difference in conversion efficiencies
of decomposers and tertiary consumers.
b.
Because large animals are tertiary consumers
whereas small microorganisms are decomposers.
c.
Because tertiary consumers only consume
secondary consumers whereas decomposers
consume dead components of each trophic level.
d.
Because tert
