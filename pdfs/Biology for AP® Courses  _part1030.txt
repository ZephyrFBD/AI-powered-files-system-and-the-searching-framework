toplasm of the target cell activate target proteins, resulting
in a cellular response. These cascades are complex because of the interplay between proteins. A significant contributor to
cell signaling cascades is the phosphorylation of molecules by enzymes known as kinases. (Substrate–level phosphorylation
was studied when you learned about glycolysis.) By adding a phosphate group, phosphorylation changes the shapes of
proteins. This change in shape activates or inactivates them. Second messengers, e.g., cAMP and Ca2+, are often used to
transmit signals within a cell.
