alled dorsal root ganglia and are shown in Figure 26.29. Each sensory neuron has one projection—with a sensory receptor
ending in skin, muscle, or sensory organs—and another that synapses with a neuron in the dorsal spinal cord. Motor neurons
have cell bodies in the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord that project to muscle through the ventral root. These neurons
are usually stimulated by interneurons within the spinal cord but are sometimes directly stimulated by sensory neurons.
Figure 26.29 Spinal nerves contain both sensory and motor axons. The somas of sensory neurons are located in
dorsal root ganglia. The somas of motor neurons are found in the ventral portion of the gray matter of the spinal cord.
