ound waves or pressure waves in the air. When these pressure waves reach
the ear, the ear transduces this mechanical stimulus (pressure wave) into a nerve impulse (electrical signal) that the brain
perceives as sound. The pressure waves strike the tympanum, causing it to vibrate. The mechanical energy from the moving
tympanum transmits the vibrations to the three bones of the middle ear. The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin
diaphragm called the oval window, which is the outermost structure of the inner ear. The structures of the inner ear are
found in the labyrinth, a bony, hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear. Here, the energy from the sound
wave is transferred from the stapes through the flexible oval window and to the fluid of the cochlea. The vibrations of the
oval window create pressure waves in the fluid (perilymph) inside the cochlea. The cochlea is a whorled structure, like the
shell of a snail, and it contains receptors for transduction of the
