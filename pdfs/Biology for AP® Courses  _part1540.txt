near chromosomes are known as telomeres, which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular
gene. In a way, these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide. In humans, a six base
pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times. The discovery of the enzyme telomerase (Figure 14.16) helped in
the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. The telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built-in
RNA template. It attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the
3' end of the DNA strand. Once the 3' end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can add
the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. Thus, the ends of the chromosomes are replicated.
