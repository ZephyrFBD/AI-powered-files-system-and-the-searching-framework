Using the Unit Guides
The Unit at a Glance table shows the topics, related enduring 
understandings, and suggested skills. The “class periods” 
column has been left blank so you can customize the time you 
spend on each topic.
The table includes suggested skills for each topic to show 
possible ways to link the content in that topic to specific AP 
Biology skills. The individual skills have been thoughtfully 
chosen in a way that allows you to scaffold the skills throughout 
the course. The questions on the Personal Progress Checks are 
based on this pairing. However, AP Exam questions can pair the 
content with any of the skills.
