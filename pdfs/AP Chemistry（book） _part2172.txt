 order to slow their 
metabolisms and conserve energy. The most extreme case is the arctic 
ground squirrel, an animal that hibernates for 7 to 8 months every year. 
Scientists have measured body temperatures as low as -3 °C in hiber-
nating arctic ground squirrels! At these low temperatures, reaction rates 
are slowed by several orders of magnitude, which allow the squirrels to 
hibernate over such long periods.

Chemical reactions take time  
to occur. Some reactions, such as the rusting 
of iron, occur relatively slowly, requiring days, 
months, or years to complete. Others, such as the 
decomposition of sodium azide, the reaction used 
to inflate automobile air bags, occur so quickly 
they are difficult to measure. As chemists, 
we need to be concerned about the speed of 
chemical reactions as well as the products of 
those reactions.
