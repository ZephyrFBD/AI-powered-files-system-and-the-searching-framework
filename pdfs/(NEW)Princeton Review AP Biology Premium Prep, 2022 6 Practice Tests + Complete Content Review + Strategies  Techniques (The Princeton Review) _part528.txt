 is a correct statement, but it does not answer the question. Choice (C) is incorrect because
enzymes catalyze reactions.
9.
B
ATP production will increase in the treated mitochondria because the low pH provides more H+ ions in
the solution. Also, oxygen provides a terminal electron acceptor for oxidative phosphorylation.
10.
D
Choices (A) and (B) are clearly wrong, as they defy physics. Choice (C) is not correct because the
anabolic and catabolic reactions are not necessarily equal nor are they direct opposites. Choice (D) is the
correct answer because it explains the increase in entropy. Even though organisms build and develop as
ordered systems, heat is lost continuously. Additionally, organisms exhale gases and produce waste
products that balance the effect of order.

C
During anaphase, the chromatids are separated by shortening of the spindle fibers. Chemically blocking
the shortening of these fibers would arrest the cell in met
