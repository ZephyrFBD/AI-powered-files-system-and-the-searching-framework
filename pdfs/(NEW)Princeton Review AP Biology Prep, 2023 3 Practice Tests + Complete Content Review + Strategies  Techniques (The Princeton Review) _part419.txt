directional if one extreme is preferred.
Hardy-Weinberg equations can be used to determine genetic variation within a population. These equations are
as follows:
p + q = 1
Frequency of the dominant (p) and recessive (q) alleles
p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1
Frequency of the homozygous dominants (p2), heterozygotes (2pq), and homozygous recessives (q2)
Hardy-Weinberg equations describe a population that is not evolving but is instead said to be in genetic
equilibrium. Such a population will be so only if it is not violating any of the following five conditions (almost
all populations are evolving due to a violation of one or more of these factors):
large population
no mutations
no immigration or emigration
random mating
no natural selection
