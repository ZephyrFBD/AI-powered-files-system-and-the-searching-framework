endosymbiotically incorporated. Additionally, cells that lacked 
mitochondria were able to respire.
(B) 
Incorrect. Mitochondria did not evolve within a cell; they were 
endosymbiotically incorporated.
(C) 
Correct. The evolution of a nuclear membrane that contains genetic 
material allowed for cells to separate the copying of genetic material and

(D) 
Incorrect. Bacteria do not have compartmentalization of cellular 
components.

Cellular 
Respiration
(A) 
Incorrect. Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol, but the Krebs cycle occurs in 
the mitochondrial matrix.
(B) 
Incorrect. The lysosomes are typically where cellular material is broken 
down, not where the Krebs cycle occurs.
(C) 
Incorrect. Neither glycolysis nor the Krebs
