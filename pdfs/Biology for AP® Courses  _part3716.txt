 the death of cardiac muscle tissue, commonly known
as a heart attack.
The Cardiac Cycle
The main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body; it does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac
cycle. The cardiac cycle is the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that
cause the heart muscles to contract and relax. The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day. In each cardiac cycle,
the heart contracts (systole), pushing out the blood and pumping it through the body; this is followed by a relaxation phase
(diastole), where the heart fills with blood, as illustrated in Figure 31.12. The atria contract at the same time, forcing blood
through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles. Closing of the atrioventricular valves produces a monosyllabic “lup”
sound. Following a brief delay, the ventricles contract at the same time forcing blood through the semilunar valves into the
aorta and the artery transporting blood to th
