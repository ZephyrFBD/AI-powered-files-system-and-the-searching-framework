o just before it reaches the end
of its 1.0-m-long string, if it is released from rest. (b) What
fraction of its kinetic energy is rotational?
79. A cyclist accelerates from rest at a rate of 
How
fast will a point at the top of the rim of the tire
be moving after 2.25 s? [Hint: At
any moment, the lowest point on the tire is in contact with
the ground and is at rest—see Fig. 8–57.]

89. A uniform rod of mass M and length 
can pivot freely 
(i.e., we ignore friction) about a hinge attached to a wall,
as in Fig. 8–63. The rod is held horizontally and then
released. At the moment of release, determine (a) the angular
acceleration of the rod, and (b) the linear acceleration 
of the tip of the rod. Assume that the force of gravity 
acts at the center of mass of the rod, as shown. [Hint: See
Fig. 8–20g.]
