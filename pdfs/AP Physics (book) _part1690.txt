6. (II) The pressure in an ideal gas is cut in half slowly, while
being kept in a container with rigid walls. In the process,
465 kJ of heat left the gas. (a) How much work was done
during this process? (b) What was the change in internal
energy of the gas during this process?

7. (II) In an engine, an almost ideal gas is compressed adia-
batically to half its volume. In doing so, 2630 J of work is
done on the gas. (a) How much heat flows into or out of
the gas? (b) What is the change in internal energy of the
gas? (c) Does its temperature rise or fall?
8. (II) An ideal gas expands at a constant total pressure of
3.0 atm from 410 mL to 690 mL. Heat then flows out of the
gas at constant volume, and the pressure and temperature
are allowed to drop until the temperature reaches its 
original value. Calculate (a) the total work done by the gas
in the process, and (b) the total heat flow into the gas.
9. (II) 8.5 moles of an ideal monatomic gas expand a
