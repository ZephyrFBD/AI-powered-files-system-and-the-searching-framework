dentify DNA fragments. You need to know the steps of this lab technique for the AP Exam:
1. DNA is cut with various restriction enzymes.
2. The DNA fragments are loaded into wells on an agarose gel.
3. As electricity runs through the gel, the fragments move according to their molecular weights. DNA is a
negatively charged molecule; therefore, it will migrate toward the positive electrode. The longer the DNA
fragment, the slower it moves through the gel.
4. The distance that each fragment has traveled is recorded.
Restriction mapping allows scientists to distinguish between the DNA of different individuals. Since a restriction
enzyme will cut only a specific DNA sequence, it will cause each individual to have a unique set of fragments called
restriction fragment length polymorphisms, or RFLPs for short. This technology is used at crime scenes to help
match DNA samples to suspects.
