Biogeography
Organisms are more like other organisms in their geographic vicinity.
Organisms in adjacent dissimilar environments are more similar than
organisms in similar environments on opposite sides of the Earth. This
suggests that organisms in adjacent dissimilar environments are
descended from recent common ancestors, rather than having evolved
