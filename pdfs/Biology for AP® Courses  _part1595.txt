osine and guanine pairs with
thymine. Adenine and cytosine form three
hydrogen bonds and guanine and thymine form
two hydrogen bonds. The two individual strands
of DNA are held together by covalent bonds
between the phosphate of one nucleotide and
sugar of the next. The two strands run
antiparallel to each other.

DNA is composed of nucleotides, consisting of a
5 carbon sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous
base. DNA is a double helical structure in which
complementary base pairing occurs. Adenine
pairs with cytosine and guanine pairs with
thymine. Adenine and cytosine form three
hydrogen bonds and guanine and thymine form
two hydrogen bonds. The two individual strands
of DNA are held together by covalent bonds
between the phosphate of one nucleotide and
sugar of the next. The two strands run parallel to
each other.
