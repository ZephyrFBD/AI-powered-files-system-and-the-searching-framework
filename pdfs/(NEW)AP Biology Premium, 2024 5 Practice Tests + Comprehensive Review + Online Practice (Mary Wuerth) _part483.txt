 Ecologists counted the number of D. ingens in an area
before and five years after a large mudslide killed the majority of the kangaroo rats in the area. Data are shown
in the table.

(a) Describe the probable cause of the change in frequency of fur color phenotypes in D. ingens after the
mudslide event.
(b) Identify an appropriate control group for this study.
(c) Analyze the data with regard to how the mudslide affected the frequencies of fur color phenotypes in D.
ingens.
(d) The burrows created by D. ingens provide habitats for many lizard species. In order to prevent future
mudslides, retaining walls were constructed on the hillsides in the area, and the number of D. ingens in the
area decreased by over 85%. Predict the effect of this on the lizard species diversity in the area, and
justify your prediction.
