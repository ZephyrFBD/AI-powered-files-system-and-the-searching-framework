Only 10 lines are shown in Fig. 12–28, so the image is crude. More lines give a
more precise image.

FIGURE 12–28 (a) Ten traces are made across 
the abdomen by moving the transducer, or by 
using an array of transducers. (b) The echoes 
from interfaces or boundaries (of organs) are 
plotted as dots to produce the image. More 
closely spaced traces would give a more 
detailed image.
Sound travels as a longitudinal wave in air and other materials.
In air, the speed of sound increases with temperature. At 20°C,
it is about 
The pitch of a sound is determined by the frequency; the
higher the frequency, the higher the pitch.
The audible range of frequencies for humans is roughly
20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (
cycle per second).
The loudness or intensity of a sound is related to the
amplitude squared of the wave. Because the human ear can detect
sound intensities from 
to over
