ure 9.19 Hybrid orbital description of bonding in NH3. Note the comparison with Figure 9.6.  
Here we focus on the hybrid orbitals used to make bonds and to hold nonbonding electron pairs.
How would we modify the figure if we were looking at PH3 rather than NH3?

SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the chemical formula for a polyatomic anion 
and asked to describe the type of hybrid orbitals surrounding the 
central atom.
Plan To determine the central atom hybrid orbitals, we must know 
the electron-domain geometry around the atom. Thus, we draw 
the Lewis structure to determine the number of electron domains 
around the central atom. The hybridization conforms to the num-
ber and geometry of electron domains around the central atom as 
predicted by the VSEPR model.
Solve The Lewis structure is
H
H N

Because there are four electron domains around N, the electron- 
domain geometry is tetrahedral. The hybridization that gives a tet-
rahedral electron-doma
