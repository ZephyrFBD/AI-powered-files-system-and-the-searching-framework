What effect do you predict these four linkages to have on 
the free energy and entropy of the native form relative 
to the free energy and entropy of a hypothetical folded 
structure that does not have any ¬ S ¬ S ¬  linkages? 
Explain. (d) A gentle reducing agent converts the four 
¬ S ¬ S ¬  linkages in ribonuclease A to eight ¬ S ¬ H 
bonds. What effect do you predict this conversion to have 
on the tertiary structure and entropy of the protein? (e) 
Which amino acid must be present for ¬ SH bonds to 
exist in ribonuclease A?

Quaternary structures of proteins arise if two or more smaller poly-
peptides or proteins associate with each other to make a much 
larger protein structure. The association is due t
