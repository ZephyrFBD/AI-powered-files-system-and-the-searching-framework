How many protons, neutrons, and electrons does the 
79Se2- ion possess?
SOLUTION
(a)  
The number of protons is the atomic number of the ele-
ment. A periodic table or list of  
elements tells us that the 
element with atomic number 22 is titanium (Ti). The mass 
number (protons plus neutrons) of this isotope of titanium is 
22 + 26 = 48. Because the ion has three more protons than 
electrons, it has a net charge of 3+ and is designated 48 
Ti3+.
(b)  
The periodic table tells us that sulfur (S) has an atomic number 
of 16. Thus, each atom or ion of sulfur contains 16 protons. We 
are told that the ion also has 16 neutrons, meaning the mass 
number is 16 + 16 = 32. Because the ion has 16 protons and 
18 electrons, its net charge is 2- and the ion symbol is 32S2-.
In general, we will focus on the net charges of ions and ignore their 
mass numbers unless the circumstances dictate that we specify a 
certain isotope.
In addition to simple ions such as Na+ and Cl-,
