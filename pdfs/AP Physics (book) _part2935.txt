the tunnel at the same time. Recall that observers moving relative to each other
do not agree about simultaneity. (See Example 26–7, next.)
EXERCISE C What is the length of the tunnel as measured by observers on the train in
Example 26–6?

FIGURE 26–10 According to an
accurate clock on a fast-moving train,
a person (a) begins dinner at 7:00 and
(b) finishes at 7:15. At the beginning
of the meal, two observers on Earth
set their watches to correspond with
the clock on the train. These observers
measure the eating time as 20 minutes.
Resolving the train and tunnel length.
Observers at rest on the Earth see a very fast 200-m-long train pass through a
200-m-long tunnel (as in Example 2
