Energy Sources
Energy from the sun is captured by green plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and photosynthetic protists. These organisms convert
solar energy into the chemical energy needed by all living things. Light availability can be an important force directly
affecting the evolution of adaptations in photosynthesizers. For instance, plants in the understory of a temperate forest are
shaded when the trees above them in the canopy completely leaf out in the late spring. Not surprisingly, understory plants
have adaptations to successfully capture available light. One such adaptation is the rapid growth of spring ephemeral plants
such as the spring beauty (Figure 35.8). These spring flowers achieve much of their growth and finish their life cycle
(reproduce) early in the season before the trees in the canopy develop leaves.
