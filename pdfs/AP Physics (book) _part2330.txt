(b) When the motor is at full speed, the back emf must be included in the equivalent
circuit shown in Fig. 21–19. In this case, Ohm’s law (or Kirchhoff’s rule) gives
Therefore
NOTE This result shows that the current can be very high when a motor first
starts up. This is why the lights in your house may dim when the motor of the
refrigerator (or other large motor) starts up. The large initial refrigerator current
causes the voltage to the lights to drop because the house wiring has resistance
and there is some voltage drop across it when large currents are drawn.
