8 An APC, such as a macrophage, engulfs and digests a foreign bacterium. An antigen from the bacterium
is presented on the cell surface in conjunction with an MHC II molecule Lymphocytes of the adaptive immune response
interact with antigen-embedded MHC II molecules to mature into functional immune cells.
This animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/immune_system) from Rockefeller University shows how dendritic cells
act as sentinels in the body's immune system.
What key role do dendritic cells play in the human immune response?
a.
Dendritic cells directly kill infected cells and emit cytokines, which amplify the immune response.
b.
Dendritic cells recognize foreign proteins and prepare them to be displayed to immune cells in the lymph.
This activates an immune response.
c.
Dendritic cells identify tumor cells or cells infected with viruses and destroy them.
d.
Dendritic cells act as phagocytes. They engulf and digest pathogens.
