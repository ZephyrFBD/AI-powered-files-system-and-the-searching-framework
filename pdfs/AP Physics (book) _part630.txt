mple, if the roller-coaster car in Fig. 6–18 is subject to frictional forces,
then the initial total energy of the car will be equal to the kinetic plus potential
energy of the car at any subsequent point along its path plus the amount of 
thermal energy produced in the process (equal to the work done by friction).
Let us recall the general form of the work-energy principle, Eq. 6–10:
where 
is the work done by nonconservative forces such as friction. Consider
an object, such as a roller-coaster car, as a particle moving under gravity with 
nonconservative forces like friction acting on it. When the object moves from some
point 1 to another point 2, then
We can rewrite this as
(6;15)
For the case of friction,
where d is the distance over which the friction
(assumed constant) acts as the object moves from point 1 to point 2. (

in opposite directions, hence the minus sign from  
in Eq. 6–1.)
