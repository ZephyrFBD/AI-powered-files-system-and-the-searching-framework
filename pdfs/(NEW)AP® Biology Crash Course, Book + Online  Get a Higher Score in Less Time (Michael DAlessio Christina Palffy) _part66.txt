Evolutionary Similarities
A. Homeostasis—the maintenance of stable internal conditions in the body—is generally controlled by a
group of body sensors, the nervous system, and the endocrine system that control in unison several body
systems (e.g., thermoregulation involves the hypothalamus sensing body temperature, causing shivering
of muscles and constriction of blood vessels to the skin, which produces sweat if the body is hot). For
more, see Chapter 8: Homeostasis.
1. Organisms use feedback mechanisms through cell communication to respond to changes in the
internal or external environment.
2. Negative feedback involves a signal pathway that ends up with a response that counteracts the
stimulus or change.
3. Positive feedback involves a response that amplifies the initial stimulus or change.
B. Cells can communicate with each other in some of the following ways:
1. Chemical messengers—such as hormones
2. Cell-to-cell contact
3. Synaptic sig
