Now consider the closed path for the situation of Fig. 22–3 where a capacitor
is being discharged. Ampère’s law works for surface 1 (current I passes through
surface 1), but it does not work for surface 2 because no current passes through
surface 2. There is a magnetic field around the wire, so the left side of Ampère’s law
is not zero around the circular closed path; yet no current flows through sur-
face 2, so the right side is zero for surface 2. We seem to have a contradiction of
Ampère’s law. There is a magnetic field present in Fig. 22–3, however, only if
charge is flowing to or away from the capacitor plates. The changing charge on
the plates means that the elect
