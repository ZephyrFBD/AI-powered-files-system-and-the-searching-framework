IST-1.F: Explain how 
meiosis results in 
the transmission of 
chromosomes from one 
generation to the next.
Meiosis
(A) 
Incorrect. This choice calculates the number of chromatids after the 
G2 checkpoint instead of chromosomes. After meiosis, the diploid 
chromosome number is halved to equal 39, not 78. After fertilization, 
the chromosome number is doubled as a result of the combination of 
the chromosomes from two gametes.
(B) 
Correct. This choice correctly identifies that although chromatids are 
duplicated after the G2 checkpoint, they still form 78 chromosome 
pairs. After meiosis, the chromosome number is divided in half. After 
fertilization, the chromosomes from two gametes are combined to form 
78 chromosomes.
(C) 
Incorrect. This choice calculates the number of chromatids after the G2 
checkpoint as twice as many as would be expected.
(D) 
Incorrect. This choice cor
