 in the path for uniform circular motion 
(Fig. 5–3). This is another example that illustrates the error in thinking that 
acceleration and velocity are always in the same direction. For an object falling 
in a vertical path,
and are indeed parallel. But in uniform circular motion,
and 
are perpendicular, not parallel (nor were they parallel in projectile motion,
Section 3–5).
Circular motion is often described in terms of the frequency f, the number of
revolutions per second. The period T of an object revolving in a circle is the time
required for one complete revolution. Period and frequency are related by

For example, if an object revolves at a frequency of

An object revolving in a circle (of circumference 
) at constant
speed v travels a distance 
in one revolution which takes a time T. Thus
Acceleration of a revolving ball. A 150-g ball at the end of
a string is revolving uniformly in a horizontal circle of radius 0.600 m, as 
in Fig. 5–1 or 5–3.
