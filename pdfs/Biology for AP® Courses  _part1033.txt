this manner enables their intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other.
Binding Initiates a Signaling Pathway
After the ligand binds to the cell-surface receptor, the activation of the receptor’s intracellular components sets off a chain
of events that is called a signaling pathway or a signaling cascade. In a signaling pathway, second messengers, enzymes,
and activated proteins interact with specific proteins, which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that eventually leads to
a change in the cell’s environment (Figure 9.10). The events in the cascade occur in a series, much like a current flows in
a river. Interactions that occur before a certain point are defined as upstream events, and events after that point are called
downstream events.
