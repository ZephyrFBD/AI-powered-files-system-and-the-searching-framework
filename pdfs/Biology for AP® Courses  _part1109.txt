hromosomes is referred to as the diploid (2n) number. (In the next chapter, we will study meiosis, the second type of cell
division in sexually reproducing organisms.)
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined
in Big Idea 3 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table. The Learning Objectives listed in
the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory
experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam questions. A Learning Objective merges required content with one or
more of the seven Science Practices.
