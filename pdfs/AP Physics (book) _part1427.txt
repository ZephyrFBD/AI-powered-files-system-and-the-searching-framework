A number of methods have been devised to measure 
and the accepted
value today is (see inside front cover for more precise value)
Since the total number of molecules, N, in a gas is equal to 
times the number
of moles
then the ideal gas law, Eq. 13–3, can be written in terms of
the number of molecules present:

Hydrogen atom mass. Use Avogadro’s number to deter-
mine the mass of a hydrogen atom.
APPROACH The mass of one atom equals the mass of 1 mol divided by the
number of atoms in 1 mol,
SOLUTION One mole of hydrogen atoms (

or Appendix B) has a mass of 
and contains 
Thus one atom has a mass
