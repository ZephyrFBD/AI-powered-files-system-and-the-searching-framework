t gives plants and photosynthetic algae their characteristic green
color. Because chloroplasts are involved in photosynthesis, we will discuss them in more detail in Chapter 6.
Did You Know?
Chloroplasts are found in plants and photosynthetic algae.
Another difference between plant and animal cells is that most of the cytoplasm within a plant cell is usually taken
up by a large vacuole—the central vacuole—that crowds the other organelles. In mature plants, this vacuole
contains the cell sap. A full vacuole in a plant is a sign that it is not dehydrated and has a healthy amount of turgor
pressure. Dehydrated plants cannot fill their vacuoles and they wilt. Plant cells also differ from animal cells in that
plant cells do not contain centrioles.
Why do we need to know about the structure of cells? Because biological structure is often closely related to
function. To help you remember the differences among prokaryotes, plant cells, and animal cells, we’ve put together
a simple table.
