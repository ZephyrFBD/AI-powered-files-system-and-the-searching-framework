The roots of seed plants have three major functions: anchoring the plant to the soil, absorbing water and minerals and
transporting them upwards, and storing the products of photosynthesis. Some roots are modified to absorb moisture and
exchange gases. Most roots are underground. Some plants, however, also have adventitious roots, which emerge above the
ground from the shoot.
Types of Root Systems
Root systems are mainly of two types (Figure 23.15). Dicots have a tap root system, while monocots have a fibrous root
system. A tap root system has a main root that grows down vertically, and from which many smaller lateral roots arise.
Dandelions are a good example; their tap roots usually break off when trying to pull these weeds, and they can regrow
another shoot from the remaining root). A tap root system penetrates deep into the soil. In contrast, a fibrous root system is
located closer to the soil surface, and forms a dense network of roots that also helps
