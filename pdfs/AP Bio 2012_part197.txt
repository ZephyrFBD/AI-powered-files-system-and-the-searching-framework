are shown. The solid lines indicate the curve with 
connected points, and the dashed lines indicate the best-fit line. 
1 point for an appropriate description of the shape of the curve: 
• 
Drawn curve shows increasing rate of transpiration from 20 to 27 degrees 
and reduction in transpiration rate from 27 to 28 degrees; or
• 
Best-fit curve shows steady increase in transpiration correlated to increase 
in temperature.
1 point for appropriate explanation of the change: 
• 
Rate of water evaporation increases with increasing temperature. 
• 
As temperature increases there are more open stomata. 
• 
At the higher temperature stomata begin to close. 
• 
Plants open and close stomata in response to environmental conditions. 
(Part b) 1 point for a properly drawn curve, as shown, with correct axes and labels. 
The curve must have some indication of humidity measure, e.g., 0–100.
1 point for a correct explanation: 
• 
Increasing humidity leads to reduced evaporation rates due to decreased
