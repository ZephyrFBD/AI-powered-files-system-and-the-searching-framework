FIGURE 16–8 Inducing a 
charge on an object connected 
to ground.
Another way to induce a net charge on a metal object is to first connect it
with a conducting wire to the ground (or a conducting pipe leading into the
ground) as shown in Fig. 16–8a (the symbol 
means connected to “ground”).
The object is then said to be grounded or “earthed.” The Earth, because it is so
large and can conduct, easily accepts or gives up electrons; hence it acts like a
reservoir for charge. If a charged object—say negative this time—is brought up
close to the metal object, free electrons in the metal are repelled and many of
them move down the wire into the Earth, Fig. 16–8b. This leaves the metal posi-
tively charged. If the wire is now cut, the metal object will have a positive induced
charge on it (Fig. 16–8c). If the wire is cut after the negative object is moved
away, the electrons would all have moved from the ground back into the meta
