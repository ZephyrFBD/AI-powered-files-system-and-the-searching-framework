REVIEW OF GLUCOSE CATABOLISM
It is important to understand how all of the previously described events
are interrelated. The following diagram depicts a eukaryotic cell with a
mitochondrion magnified for detail.
To calculate the net amount of ATP produced per molecule of glucose, we
need to tally the number of ATP produced by substrate level

phosphorylation and the number of ATP produced by oxidative
phosphorylation.
Substrate Level Phosphorylation
Degradation of one glucose molecule yields a net of 2 ATP from glycolysis
and 1 ATP for each turn of the citric acid cycle with two turns per glucose.
Thus, a total of 4 ATP are produced by substrate level phosphorylation.
Oxidative Phosphorylation
Two pyruvate decarboxylations yield 1 NADH each for a total of 2 NADH
per glucose. Each turn of the citric acid cycle yields 3 NADH and 1 FADH2,
for a total of 6 NADH and 2 FADH2 per glucose molecule. Each FADH2
generates 2 ATP, as previously d
