EARTH’S ATMOSPHERE (SECTION 18.1) In this section we 
examined the physical and chemical properties of Earth’s atmo-
sphere. The complex temperature variations in the atmosphere 
give rise to four regions, each with characteristic properties. The 
lowest of these regions, the troposphere, extends from Earth’s sur-
face up to an altitude of about 12 km. Above the troposphere, in 
order of increasing altitude, are the stratosphere, mesosphere, and 
thermosphere. In the upper reaches of the atmosphere, only the 
simplest chemical species can survive the bombardment of highly 
energetic particles and radiation from the Sun. The average molec-
ular weight of the atmosphere at high elevations is lower than 
that at Earth’s surface because the lightest atoms and molecules 
diffuse upward and also because of photodissociation, which is the 
breaking of bonds in molecules because of the absorption of light. 
Absorption of radiation may also lead to the formation of ions via 
photoion
