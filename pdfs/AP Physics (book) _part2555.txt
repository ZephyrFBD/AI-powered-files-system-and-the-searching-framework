FIGURE 23–28 Total internal
reflection of light by prisms in
binoculars.
Many optical instruments, such as binoculars, use total internal reflection
within a prism to reflect light. The advantage is that very nearly 100% of the light
is reflected, whereas even the best mirrors reflect somewhat less than 100%. Thus
the image is brighter, especially after several reflections. For glass with
Therefore, 45° prisms will reflect all the light internally, if oriented as
shown in the binoculars of Fig. 23–28.
