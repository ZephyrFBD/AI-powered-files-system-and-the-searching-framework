right the curve is, the less
affinity the hemoglobin has for oxygen.
STUDY TIP
On these graphs, the curve on the left shows greater affinity for oxygen.
Graph A: Here is a dissociation curve of adult hemoglobin at
normal and low blood pH showing the Bohr shift. At a lower pH,
the hemoglobin has less affinity for oxygen.
Graph B: Here is a dissociation curve for hemoglobin of two
different mammals: a mouse and an elephant. The mouse has a
much higher metabolism, and its body cells have a correspondingly
higher oxygen requirement. To accommodate the animalâ€™s oxygen
needs, the mouse hemoglobin has a dissociation curve located to the
right of the elephant hemoglobin dissociation curve. In other words,
mouse hemoglobin drops off O2 at cells more easily than does
elephant hemoglobin.
Graph C: Here is a dissociation curve for fetal and maternal
hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than
adult hemoglobin does so it can take oxygen from the maternal
hemoglobin. Also note
