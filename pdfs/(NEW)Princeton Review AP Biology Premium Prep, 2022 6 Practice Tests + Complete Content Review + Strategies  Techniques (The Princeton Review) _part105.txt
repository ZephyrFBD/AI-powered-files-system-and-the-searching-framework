th “which of the following best
predicts the consequence …” or “which of the following best supports the claim that …”
Questions 4–6 refer to the following material.
Table 1. Effect of temperature on glucose production
Figure 1. Effect of heat on the structure of lactase
Lactase is an enzyme found in many mammals that breaks down lactose, a sugar found in
milk, into glucose through a hydrolysis reaction. Scientists hypothesized that lactase’s efficiency
is affected by temperature. To test this hypothesis, the scientists dissolved lactase tablets in 200
mL of water and mixed 1 mL of the resulting enzyme solution with 2 mL of milk at different
temperatures. After 20 minutes, the scientists tested for the presence of glucose using test strips.
The glucose test strips are yellow in the absence of glucose and turn increasingly darker shades of
green when glucose is present. The results are shown in Figure 1.
