.11 is ﬁrst 
order in CHCl3 and one-half order in Cl2. The overall reaction 
order is three halves.
(b) For the rate law for Equation 14.9, we have
Units of rate = 1units of rate constant21units of concentration2 
so
Units of rate constant =
units of rate
units of concentration =
M>s
M
= s-1
Note that if the reaction order changes, the units of the rate con-
stant change.
