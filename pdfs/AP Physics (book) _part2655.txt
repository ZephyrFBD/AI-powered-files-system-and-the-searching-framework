 wavelength of light that reaches the retina is 
and is
the same whether the light enters from the air or from water.
24–5 Diffraction by a Single Slit or Disk
Young’s double-slit experiment put the wave theory of light on a firm footing.
But full acceptance came only with studies on diffraction (Section 24–1) more
than a decade later, in the 1810s and 1820s.
We have already discussed diffraction briefly with regard to water waves
(Section 11–14) as well as for light (Section 24–1). We have seen that diffraction
refers to the spreading or bending of waves around edges. Let’s look in more detail.
In 1819 Augustin Fresnel (1788–1827) presented to the French Academy a
wave theory of light that predicted and explained interference and diffraction
effects. Almost immediately Siméon Poisson (1781–1840) pointed out a counter-
intuitive inference: according to Fresnel’s wave theory, if light from a point source
were to fall on a solid disk, part of the incident light would be diffracted around
