id. The higher the vapor pressure of a liquid, the more read-
ily it evaporates and the more volatile it is. Vapor pressure increases 
with temperature. Boiling occurs when the vapor pressure equals the 
external pressure. Thus, the boiling point of a liquid depends on pres-
sure. The normal boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor 
pressure equals 1 atm.
PHASE DIAGRAMS (SECTION 11.6) The equilibria between the 
solid, liquid, and gas phases of a substance as a function of tempera-
ture and pressure are displayed on a phase diagram. A line indicates 
equilibria between any two phases. The line through the melting 
point usually slopes slightly to the right as pressure increases, because 
the solid is usually more dense than the liquid. The melting point at 
1Â atm is the normal melting point. The point on the diagram at which 
all three phases coexist in equilibrium is called the triple point. The 
critical point corresponds to the critical temperature and critical pres-
