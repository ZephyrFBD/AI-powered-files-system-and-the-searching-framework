ction to 
perform the calculation:
3H+4 = antilog 1-3.762 = 10-3.76 = 1.7 * 10-4 M
Comment The number of significant figures in 3H+4 is two because 
the number of decimal places in the pH is two.
Check Because the pH is between 3.0 and 4.0, we know that 3H+4 
will be between 1.0 * 10-3 M and 1.0 * 10-4 M. Our calculated 
3H+4 falls within this estimated range.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
A solution at 25 °C has pOH = 10.53. Which of the following 
statements is or are true?
(i) The solution is acidic.
(ii) The pH of the solution is 14.00 - 10.53.
(iii) For this solution, 3OH-4 = 10-10.53M.
(a) Only one of the statements is true.
(b) Statements (i) and (ii) are true.
(c) Statements (i) and (iii) are true.
(d) Statements (ii) and (iii) are true.
(e) All three statements are true.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
A solution formed by dissolving an antacid tablet has a pOH 
of 4.82. Calculate 3H+4.
