Step 2 Slowly draw up the contents of the first sample tube into the pipette. 
Step 3 Using two hands, steady the pipette over the well you are going to load. 
Step 4 Expel any air in the end of the pipette before loading the DNA sample.

Step 5 Dip the pipette tip through the surface of the buffer, position it just inside the 
well, and slowly expel the mixture. Sucrose in the loading dye weighs down the sample, 
causing it to sink to the bottom of the well. Be careful not to puncture the bottom of the 
well with the pipette tip or reaspirate your sample up into the pipette. 
Step 6 Draw the pipette tip out of the buffer.
