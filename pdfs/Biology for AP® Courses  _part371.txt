els of structure?
a.
The primary chain forms secondary α-helix and
β-pleated sheets which fold onto each other
forming the tertiary structure.
b.
The primary structure undergoes alternative
splicing to form secondary structures, which fold
on other protein chains to form tertiary
structures.
c.
The primary structure forms secondary α-helix
and β-pleated sheets. This further undergoes
phosphorylation and acetylation to form the
tertiary structure.
d.
The primary structure undergoes alternative
splicing to form a secondary structure, and then
disulfide bonds give way to tertiary structures.
53. What structural level of proteins is functional? Why?
a.
The secondary structure is functional as it attains
its 2-dimensional shape which has the necessary
bonds.
b.
The tertiary structure is functional as it possesses
the geometric shape showing the necessary loops
and bends.
c.
The tertiary structure is functional as it has the
non-covalent and covalent bonds along with the
subunits attached at
