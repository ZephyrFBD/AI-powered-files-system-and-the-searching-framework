amount of water released in urine. The person simply
urinates more. Another commonly prescribed drug is an angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which prevents the formation of
angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors inhibit the formation of aldosterone and
thereby decrease blood volume. Both of these drugs work in opposition to
what the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system normally does (which is
raise blood pressure).
MUSCLE
There are three types of muscle: smooth, cardiac, and skeletal. Smooth or
involuntary muscle makes up the walls of the blood vessels and the
digestive tract. Because of the arrangement of its actin and myosin
filaments, it does not have a striated appearance. It is under the control of
the autonomic nervous system. Cardiac muscle makes up the heart. It
generates its own action potential; individual heart cells will beat on their
own in a saline solution. Skeletal or voluntary muscles are very large and
multinucleate. They work in pairs: one muscle contracts whil
