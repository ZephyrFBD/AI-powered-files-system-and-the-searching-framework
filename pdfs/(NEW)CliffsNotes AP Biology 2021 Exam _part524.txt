of cells or produce toxic chemicals. To protect against these foreign invaders (and to maintain homeostasis), humans
possess three levels of defense.
The skin and mucous membranes provide a nonspecific first line of defense against invaders entering through the
skin or through openings into the body. A nonspecific defense is not specialized for a particular invader. Rather, it is
a general defense against all kinds of pathogens. The first line of defense features the following characteristics:
1. Skin is a physical and hostile barrier covered with oily and acidic (pH from 3 to 5) secretions from sweat glands.
2. Antimicrobial proteins (such as lysozyme, which breaks down the cell walls of bacteria) are contained in saliva,
tears, and other secretions found on mucous membranes.
3. Cilia that line the airway serve to sweep invaders out of the lungs.
4. Gastric juice of the stomach kills most microbes.
5. Symbiotic bacteria found in the digestive tract and the vagina outcompete many
