other way of stating this is that
the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus.
Either way, the atomâ€™s relative electronegativity contributes to the development of partial charges whenever one element is
significantly more electronegative than the other, and the charges generated by these polar bonds may then be used for the
formation of hydrogen bonds based on the attraction of opposite partial charges. (Hydrogen bonds, which are discussed in
detail below, are weak bonds between slightly positively charged hydrogen atoms to slightly negatively charged atoms in
other molecules.) Since macromolecules often have atoms within them that differ in electronegativity, polar bonds are often
present in organic molecules.
Nonpolar Covalent Bonds
Nonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons
equally. For example, molecular oxygen (O2) is nonpolar be
