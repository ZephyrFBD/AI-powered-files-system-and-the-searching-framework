When the reactants are added, the researchers know the exact
concentrations of each. This makes it easy to examine initial reaction
rates as a function of concentration. However, as the reaction
proceeds, it will be more diﬀicult to determine the exact concentration
at any given point. (C) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because the

reaction rate is aﬀected by multiple variables, so it does not follow the
simple pattern suggested. (B) is incorrect because there is no
information provided about whether the reaction generates heat. (D) is
incorrect because the researchers were not acting to save time but to
work with information that had already been ascertained.

According to the table, each increase in concentration of 11.1 μM leads
to an increase in Vmax of about 1.5 μM/minute. Thus, Vmax for the
concentration given in the question stem should be around 11.2
μM/minute, (B). (A) is too high and would more likely
