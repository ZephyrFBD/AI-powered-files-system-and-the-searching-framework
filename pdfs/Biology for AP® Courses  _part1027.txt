nctional groups attached to the carbon skeleton. Steroid hormones include
the female sex hormone, estradiol, which is a type of estrogen; the male sex hormone, testosterone; and cholesterol, which
is an important structural component of biological membranes and a precursor of steriod hormones (Figure 9.9). Other
hydrophobic hormones include thyroid hormones and vitamin D. In order to be soluble in blood, hydrophobic ligands must
bind to carrier proteins while they are being transported through the bloodstream.
Figure 9.9 Steroid hormones have similar chemical structures to their precursor, cholesterol. Because these molecules
are small and hydrophobic, they can diffuse directly across the plasma membrane into the cell, where they interact
with internal receptors.
Water-Soluble Ligands
Water-soluble ligands are polar and therefore cannot pass through the plasma membrane unaided; sometimes, they are too
large to pass through the membrane at all. Instead, most water-soluble ligands bind t
