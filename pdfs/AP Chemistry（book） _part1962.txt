r forces. Polymers contain very long 
chains of atoms held together by covalent bonds. These chains 
are usually held to one another by weaker intermolecular forces. 
Nanomaterials are solids where the dimensions of individual crystals 
are on the order of 1â€“100 nm.
STRUCTURES OF SOLIDS (SECTION 12.2) In crystalline solids, 
particles are arranged in a regularly repeating pattern. In amorphous 
solids, however, particles show no long-range order. In a crystalline 
solid the smallest repeating unit is called a unit cell. All unit cells in 
a crystal contain an identical arrangement of atoms. The geometri-
cal pattern of points on which the unit cells are arranged is called a 
 
crystal lattice. To generate a crystal structure a motif, which is an atom 
or group of atoms, is associated with each and every lattice point.
In two dimensions, the unit cell is a parallelogram whose size 
and shape are defined by two lattice vectors (a and b). There are five 
primitive lattices, lattices in wh
