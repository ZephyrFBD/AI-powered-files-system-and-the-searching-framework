s. The 
most powerful tool biotechnologists have, though, is the ability to transfer DNA from 
one organism into another and make it function there. With this tool, they can make 
cells produce novel protein products that the cells did not make previously. 
Stimulate student interest in the investigation by describing applications of genetic 
engineering. For example, insulin that people take to control their blood sugar levels 
is often made from engineered bacteria. Some vaccines, as well as enzymes used for 
manufacturing denim jeans, are also made using engineered cells. In the near future, 
engineered bacteria and other cells being developed could help clean up spilled oil or 
chemicals, produce fuel for cars and trucks, and even store excess carbon dioxide to 
help slow global climate change. Ask students to think of other possible applications 
of biotechnology. Remind students, however, that human manipulation of DNA raises 
several ethical, social, and medical issues, such as
