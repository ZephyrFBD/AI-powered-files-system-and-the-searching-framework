 of NaCl in 500 mL of H20; bring to 1 L total volume. 
3. 1 M glucose (dextrose): Dissolve 180.2 g of glucose in 500 mL of H20; bring to 1 L 
total volume. 
4. 5% ovalbumin (if possible, store powder in the refrigerator to prevent clumping): 
Mix 50 g of ovalbumin with 500 mL of H20; bring to 1 L total volume. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To prepare dialysis tubing, cut dialysis tubing into 20-cm pieces; soak pieces in water. 
Extra dialysis tubing can be kept in 20% ethanol in the refrigerator to prevent bacterial 
growth. 
Students use the dialysis tubing to model cells. The dialysis tubing is knotted in one 
end, filled with 10 mL solution, and knotted to close the tube. Make sure students leave 
enough space for water to diffuse into the tube. Tell students to keep the dialysis tubing 
moist. 
■ Data Analysis 
From the data, students should consider several questions. 
•  What factors determine the rate and direction of osmosis? 
•  What would you predict if you used a starch solutio
