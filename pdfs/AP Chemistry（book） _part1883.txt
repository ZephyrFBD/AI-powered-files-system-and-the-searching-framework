e. Consequently, the electronic structure of the crystal is 
like that of the infinite chain, consisting of bands, as shown on the right-hand side of 
Figure 12.22.
The electronic structures of most metals are more complicated than those shown in 
Figure 12.22 because we have to consider more than one type of atomic orbital on each 
atom. Because each type of orbital can give rise to its own band, the electronic structure 
of a solid usually consists of a series of bands. The electronic structure of a bulk solid is 
referred to as a band structure.
The band structure of a typical metal is shown schematically in Figure 12.23. The 
electron filling depicted corresponds to nickel metal, but the basic features of other

If the metal were potassium rather than nickel, which bands—4s, 4p,  
and/or 3d—would be partially occupied?
