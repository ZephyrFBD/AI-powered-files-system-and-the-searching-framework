F THERMODYNAMICS (SECTION 19.3) A particular 
combination of motions and locations of the atoms and molecules 
of a system at a particular instant is called a microstate. The entropy 
of a system is a measure of its randomness or disorder. The entropy 
is related to the number of microstates, W, corresponding to the 
state of the system: S = k ln W. Molecules can undergo three kinds 
of motion: In translational motion the entire molecule moves in space. 
Molecules can also undergo vibrational motion, in which the atoms of 
the molecule move toward and away from one another in periodic 
fashion, and rotational motion, in which the entire molecule spins like 
a top. The number of available microstates, and therefore the en-
tropy, increases with an increase in volume, temperature, or motion 
of molecules because any of these changes increases the possible mo-
tions and locations of the molecules. As a result, entropy generally 
increases when liquids or solutions are formed from solids,
