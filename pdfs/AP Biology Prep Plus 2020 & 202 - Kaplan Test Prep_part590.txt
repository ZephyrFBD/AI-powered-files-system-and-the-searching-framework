erent structures. How does a cell in the eye of an eagle
express the proper genes to make proteins for eye development and
function, while a cell in the pectoral muscle of an eagle expresses proteins
to build muscle tissue and use energy? The regulation of gene expression
in eukaryotes causes cells to diﬀerentiate. Since most eukaryotic cells in a
given organism contain the same set of genetic material, diﬀerential
expression determines the cells’ structure and function. Each cell type
undergoes diﬀerentiation and specialization to produce specific
proteins with particular functions according to its needs. For instance,
regulation determines whether cells become lens cells that are sensitive to
light, muscle cells that contract, or nerve cells that transmit information.
Another example is the expression of the SRY (sex-determining region Y)
gene on the Y chromosome, which initiates male sexual development.
Errors or changes in gene regulation during development may lead to
severe and d
