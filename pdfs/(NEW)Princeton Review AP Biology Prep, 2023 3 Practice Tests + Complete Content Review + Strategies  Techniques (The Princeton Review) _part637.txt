cted that the poky mutation was carried in the mitochondria, instead of in the nuclear
genome. The following experiments were designed to test this hypothesis.
Step 1: Mitochondria were extracted from poky Neurospora mutants.
Step 2: An ultrafine needle and syringe was used to inject these mitochondria into wild-type Neurospora cells.
Step 3: These recipient cells were cultured for several generaâ€‹tions, and the phenotypes were examined.
Results: The poky phenotype was observed in some of the cultured fungi.
(a) In mitochondrial inheritance the offspring have the genotype and phenotype of the mother. Under
Mendelian inheritance it is possible for the offspring to have a different genotype but the same phenotype
as the mother. Describe how this is possible.
(b) Explain what important control(s) the scientists should do to account for the procedure in Step 2.
(c) If the nuclear DNA was injected into the wild-type Neurospora cells instead of the mitochondria, explain
whether the resulting
