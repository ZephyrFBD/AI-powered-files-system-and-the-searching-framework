 as a result of increased membrane permeability. 
The student prepared identical samples of beet root tissue and incubated each sample for 15 minutes in the 
specific solution for that group. At the end of the incubation period, the student measured the absorbance of  
460 nm light for each sample. A greater concentration of betacyanin in the solution surrounding the beet root cells 
results in a greater absorbance of 460 nm light. The results of the experiment are shown in the table above.
