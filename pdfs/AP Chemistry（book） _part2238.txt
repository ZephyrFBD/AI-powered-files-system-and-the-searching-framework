Give It Some Thought
Suppose you could measure the rate constants for both the forward and reverse reactions 
of the process in Figure 14.16. In which direction would the rate constant be larger?

CHAPTER 14 Chemical Kinetics
Any particular methyl isonitrile molecule acquires sufficient energy to overcome the 
energy barrier through collisions with other molecules. Recall from the kinetic-molecular 
theory of gases that, at any instant, gas molecules are distri
