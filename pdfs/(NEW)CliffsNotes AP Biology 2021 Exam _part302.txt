e L-M frequency
to determine which configuration of M and L is correct. Since the L-M frequency is 7, only the M and L positions at
the right are correct. That leaves only one possible sequence, K-J-L-M.
17. D. In any pedigree problem, you should begin by first identifying genotypes for which there is only one
possibility. For a sex-linked recessive pattern of inheritance, you can identify the genotypes of all males and of all
females that express the trait that the pedigree is describing. In this case, color-blind males are XnY (filled boxes, 1,
10,
12, 16), normal males are XNY (open boxes, 3,6,8, 13), and color-blind females are XnXn (filled circle, 7).
18. B. The next step in this pedigree problem is to identify the normal females (open circles). Are they XNXN or
XNXn? Note that box 12 is a color-blind son (XnY). Since a son can inherit only his Y chromosome
from his father (box 6), box 12 must have inherited his Xn gene from his mother (circle 5). Thus, you can conclude
that the m
