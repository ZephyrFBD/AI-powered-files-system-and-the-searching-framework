and epilepsy.
How do scientists identify new neurons? A researcher can inject a compound called bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) into the brain of an animal. While all cells will be exposed to BrdU, BrdU will only be incorporated
into the DNA of newly generated cells that are in S phase. A technique called immunohistochemistry can
be used to attach a fluorescent label to the incorporated BrdU, and a researcher can use fluorescent
microscopy to visualize the presence of BrdU, and thus new neurons, in brain tissue. Figure 26.6 is a
micrograph which shows fluorescently labeled neurons in the hippocampus of a rat.
Figure 26.6 This micrograph shows fluorescently labeled new neurons in a rat hippocampus. Cells that are
actively dividing have bromodoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporated into their DNA and are labeled in red. Cells that
express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) are labeled in green. Astrocytes, but not neurons, express GFAP.
Thus, cells that are labeled b
