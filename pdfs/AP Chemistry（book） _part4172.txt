s and the final value of n decreases. In the limit nf = 1 
and ni goes to infinity, which gives a photon energy, Ephoton = hcRH.  
page 225 Yes, all moving objects produce matter waves, but the 
wavelengths associated with macroscopic objects, such as the  
baseball, are too small to allow for any way of observing them.  
page 227 Less important. page 228 In the first statement, we 
know exactly where the electron is. In the second statement, we 
are saying that we know the probability of the electron being at a 
point, but we donâ€™t know exactly where it is. The second statement 
is consistent with the Uncertainty Principle. page 229 In the Bohr 
model electrons move in orbits, each of which has a specific fixed 
distance from the nucleus. In the modern picture of the atom elec-
trons are found in orbitals and cannot be said to orbit the nucleus 
at a specific distance. page 234 The two orbitals have the same 
principal quantum number, n = 3, and the same orbital angular 
momentum quan
