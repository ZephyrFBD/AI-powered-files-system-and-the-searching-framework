 processes are critical to the life of the cell, take
place constantly, and demand energy provided by ATP and other high-energy molecules like NADH (nicotinamide adenine

dinucleotide) and NADPH (Figure 6.5).
ATP is an important molecule for cells to have in sufficient supply at all times. The breakdown of sugars illustrates how a
single molecule of glucose can store enough energy to make a great deal of ATP, 36 to 38 molecules. This is a catabolic
pathway. Catabolic pathways involve the degradation (or breakdown) of complex molecules into simpler ones. Molecular
energy stored in the bonds of complex molecules is released in catabolic pathways and harvested in such a way that it can be
used to produce ATP. Other energy-storing molecules, such as fats, are also broken down through similar catabolic reactions
to release energy and make ATP (Figure 6.5).
It is important to know that the chemical reactions of metabolic pathways donâ€™t take place spontaneously. Each
