er than prokaryotes and much simpler in
structure. They must reproduce inside a host cell. Their origin is still a mystery to us, but we do know that they can make
us very sick.
Viruses have a basic structure: a DNA or RNA core surrounded by an outer capsid of proteins. Some viruses have an
outer phospholipid envelope. As we will explore in more detail, many viruses use some sort of glycoprotein to attach to
their host cells. Viruses infect all known cell types and use the host cellâ€™s replication proteins and metabolic machinery to
replicate. Classification of viruses is challenging, but one method categorizes them based on how they produce their mRNA.
Retroviruses (also called RNA viruses) use the enzyme reverse transcriptase to transcribe DNA from RNA. (In the Genes
and Proteins chapter we learned that the usual flow of genetic information is from DNA to RNA to protein.) Common
viruses include bacteriophage T4, adenovirus, and HIV retrovirus.
