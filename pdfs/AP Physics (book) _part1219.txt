e see from Eq. 11–20 that if the velocity increases,
the angle increases, and vice versa.

FIGURE 11–43 Water waves refract
gradually as they approach the
shore, as their velocity decreases.
There is no distinct boundary, as in
Fig. 11–42, because the wave 
velocity changes gradually.

Earthquake waves refract within the Earth as they travel through rock layers
of different densities (which have different velocities) just as water waves do. Light
