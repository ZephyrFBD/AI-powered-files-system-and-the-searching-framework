he Chemistry of Life: Organic and Biological Chemistry
Polypeptides are formed when a large number of amino acids 17302 are linked 
together by peptide bonds. Proteins are linear (that is, unbranched) polypeptide mole-
cules with molecular weights ranging from about 6000 to over 50 million amu. Because 
up to 22 different amino acids are linked together in proteins and because proteins con-
sist of hundreds of amino acids, the number of possible arrangements of amino acids 
within proteins is virtually limitless.
Protein structure
The sequence of amino acids from the “N terminus” (that is, the amino end) to the “C 
terminus” (the carboxylic acid end) along a protein chain is called its primary struc-
ture and gives the protein its unique identity. A change in even one amino acid can 
alter the biochemical characteristics of the protein. For example, sickle-cell anemia is 
a genetic disorder resulting from a single replacement in a protein chain in hemoglo-
bin. The chain that is affect
