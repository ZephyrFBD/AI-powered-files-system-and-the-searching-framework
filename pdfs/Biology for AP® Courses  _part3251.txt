color
vision would not be possible, and a two-cone (dichromatic) system has limitations. Primates use a three-cone (trichromatic)
system, resulting in full color vision.
The color we perceive is a result of the ratio of activity of our three types of cones. The colors of the visual spectrum,
running from long-wavelength light to short, are red (700 nm), orange (600 nm), yellow (565 nm), green (497 nm), blue
(470 nm), indigo (450 nm), and violet (425 nm). Humans have very sensitive perception of color and can distinguish about
500 levels of brightness, 200 different hues, and 20 steps of saturation, or about 2 million distinct colors.

is considerable overlap in the wavelengths of light detected.
