LEARNING OBJECTIVE
EVO-1.K
Describe the conditions 
under which allele and 
genotype frequencies will 
change in populations.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
EVO-1.K.1
Hardy-Weinberg is a model for describing and 
predicting allele frequencies in a nonevolving 
population. Conditions for a population or 
an allele to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
areâ€”(1) a large population size, (2) absence 
of migration, (3) no net mutations, (4) random 
mating, and (5) absence of selection. These 
conditions are seldom met, but they provide a 
valuable null hypothesis.
EVO-1.K.2
Allele frequencies in a population can be 
calculated from genotype frequencies.
RELEVANT EQUATION
Hardy-Weinberg-Equation 
p^2 + 2 p q + q ^
2 = 1 p + q = 1
where:
 p = frequency of allele 1 in the populatio
n q = frequency of allele 2 in the population
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING

Evolution is characterized by a change in the genetic makeup of a population over
