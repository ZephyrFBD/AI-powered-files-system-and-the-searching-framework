bind to another
part of the enzyme and alter its shape. Malonate is an inhibitor of the
respiratory enzyme succinate dehydrogenase in the following
reaction:
Succinate â†’Malonate(inhibitor)Succinate dehydrogenase(enzyme)Fumarate
Which of the following choices best describes the best way to
determine whether malonate is a competitive inhibitor or a
noncompetitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase?
In the presence of malonate, increase the concentration of
succinate, the substrate. If the rate of reaction increases, then
malonate is a competitive inhibitor.
In the presence of malonate, increase the concentration of
succinate, the substrate. If the rate of reaction increases, then
malonate is a noncompetitive inhibitor.
Malonate can alternate between acting as a competitive
inhibitor and a noncompetitive inhibitor, depending on what is
required.
A coenzyme must be affecting the rate of the reaction.
