This process is described as a “cycle” because it corresponds to 
the scheme in Figure 8.6, which shows how all the quantities we have 
just calculated are related. The sum of all the blue “up” arrow ener-
gies has to be equal to the sum of all the red “down” arrow energies 
in this cycle. Born and Haber recognized that if we know the value of 
every quantity in the cycle except the lattice energy, we can calculate 
it from this cycle.
