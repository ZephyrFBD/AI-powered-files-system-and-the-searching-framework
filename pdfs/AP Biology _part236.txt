transport chain produces NADPH, not ATP.
Here is an overview of noncyclic photophosphorylation.

Figure 7.6 Overview of Photosynthesis
Cyclic Photophosphorylation
The sole purpose of cyclic photophosphorylation is to produce ATP. No
NADPH is produced, and no oxygen is released.
The production of sugar that occurs during the Calvin cycle consumes
enormous amounts of ATP, so periodically, the chloroplast runs low on
ATP. 
When 
it 
does, 
the 
chloroplast 
carries 
out 
cyclic
photophosphorylation to replenish the ATP levels. Cyclic electron flow
takes photoexcited electrons on a short-circuit pathway. Electrons travel
from the P680 electron transport chain to P700, to a primary electron
acceptor, and then back to the cytochrome complex in the P680 electron
transport chain. Cyclic photophosphorylation is shown in Figure 7.7.
