Among their many functions, minerals help in structure and regulation and are considered co-factors. Certain amino acids
also must be procured from food and cannot be synthesized by the body. These amino acids are the “essential” amino acids.
The human body can synthesize only 11 of the 20 required amino acids; the rest must be obtained from food. The essential
amino acids are listed in Table 25.4.
