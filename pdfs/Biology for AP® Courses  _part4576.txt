 50 years.
a.
Biodiversity of these northernmost regions will
remain constant as humans will find other more
habitable locations to house their growing
numbers.
b.
The populations of organisms presently
inhabiting these regions will shift as global
warming causes many species to decline and
new species to move in.
c.
The carrying capacity of these regions for
humans will decrease as the human population
increases exponentially.
d.
Ecosystems can be expected to remain
untouched by humans as new technologies are
developed to sustain a growing population.
105. A researcher is interested in investigating whether the
croaking pattern produced by males in a frog species is a
learned behavior or an innate behavior. Which of the
following would best help the researcher answer this
question?
a.
genetic analyses of adult male frogs raised in
isolation and in multigenerational frog
communities
b.
field observations of adult frogs in their native
habitat during mating season
c.
video recordings of
