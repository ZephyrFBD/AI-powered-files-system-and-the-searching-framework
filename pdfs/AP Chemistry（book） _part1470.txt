Give It Some Thought
Figure 9.43 indicates that C2 is diamagnetic. Would that be expected if the s
2p MO 
were lower in energy than the p

substances to form nitrogen compounds. The high bond order of the molecule helps 
explain its exceptional stability. We should also note, however, that molecules with the 
same bond orders do not have the same bond distances and bond enthalpies. Bond order 
is only one factor influencing these properties. Other factors include nuclear
