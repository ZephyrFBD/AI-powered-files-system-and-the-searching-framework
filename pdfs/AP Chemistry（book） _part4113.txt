b) Reaction temperature of 500 K, by criteria 6, 12, and 1.  
(c) Sodium chloride as a by-product, according to criteria 1, 3, and 12. 
18.64 Multiply equations 18.7 and 18.9 by a factor of 2. Add these 
two equations to a third equation, O(g) + O(g) ¡  O21g2. 2 Cl 1g2 
and 2 ClO 1g2 cancel from each side of the resulting equation to pro-
duce equation 18.10. 18.67 (a) A CFC has C—Cl bonds and C—F 
bonds. In an HFC, the C—Cl bonds are replaced by C—H bonds.  
(b) Stratospheric lifetime is signiﬁcant because, the longer a halogen-
containing molecule exists in the stratosphere, the greater the likeli-
hood that it will encounter light with energy sufficient to dissociate a 
carbon-halogen bond. Free halogen atoms are the bad actors in ozone 
destruction. (c) HFCs have replaced CFCs because it is infrequent that 
light with energy sufficient to dissociate a C—F bond will reach an HFC 
molecule. F atoms are much less likely than Cl atoms to be produced
