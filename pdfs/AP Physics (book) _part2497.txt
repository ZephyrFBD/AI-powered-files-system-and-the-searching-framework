y, however, is introduced
because this signal must travel from the transmitter to the
clocks. Assuming Fort Collins is no more than 3000 km from
any point in the U.S., what is the longest travel-time delay?
49. If the Sun were to disappear or radically change its output,
how long would it take for us on Earth to learn about it?
50. Cosmic microwave background radiation fills space with an
average energy density of about 
(a) Find the
rms value of the electric field associated with this radiation.
(b) How far from a 7.5-kW radio transmitter emitting uni-
formly in all directions would you find a comparable value?
51. What are 
and 
at a point 2.50 m from a light source
whose output is 18 W? Assume the bulb emits radiation of
a single frequency uniformly in all directions.
52. Estimate the rms electric field in the sunlight that hits Mars,
knowing that the Earth receives about 
and that
Mars is 1.52 times farther from the Sun (on average) than
is the Earth.
53. The average intensity of a
