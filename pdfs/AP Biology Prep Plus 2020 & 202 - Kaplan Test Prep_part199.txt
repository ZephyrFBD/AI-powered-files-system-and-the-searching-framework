es that infect bacteria in a
lytic way and cause active viral replication are called lytic phages, while
those whose DNA gets integrated into the host cell’s DNA (in a lysogenic
fashion) are called temperate phages. While integrated, the
bacteriophage is known as a prophage.
ATYPICAL VIRUS-LIKE FORMS
There are a few exceptions to the typical virus described above, and these
particles (which certainly cannot be considered living organisms
according to the standard definition of life) are infectious to many living
cells:
Viroids are virus-like particles that are composed of a single molecule of
circular RNA without any surrounding capsid or envelope. The RNA can
replicate using a host’s machinery, but it does not seem to code for any
specific proteins. Despite this, viroids have been implicated in some plant
diseases, though not in diseases in any other organisms.
Prions are simply pieces of protein that are infectious. They have gained
fame through the recent spread of mad cow disease (
