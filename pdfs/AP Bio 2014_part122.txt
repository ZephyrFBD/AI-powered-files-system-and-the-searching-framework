β-hemoglobin is a highly conserved protein among vertebrates. The identity of amino acid 104–one of 
the variable amino acids in the polypeptide–in four vertebrate species is shown in the table above. 
A student constructed the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 1 by comparing the amino acid 
sequences of β-hemoglobin in the four species. The student placed “Lys” at an incorrect position on 
the phylogenetic tree in an attempt to show when the mutation affecting amino acid 104 occurred.
