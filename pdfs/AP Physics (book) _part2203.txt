FIGURE 20–18 The white ring inside
the glass tube is the glow of a beam
of electrons that ionize the gas
molecules. The red coils of current-
carrying wire produce a nearly
uniform magnetic field, illustrating
the circular path of charged particles
in a uniform magnetic field.

The time T required for a particle of charge q moving with constant speed to
make one circular revolution in a uniform magnetic field
is
where
is the circumference of its circular path. From Example 20–6,
so
Since T is the period of rotation, the frequency of rotation is
(20;5)
This is often called the cyclotron frequency of a particle in a field because this is
the frequency at which particles revolve in a cyclotron (see Problem 88).
