through dense woods. The bright feathers on the male bird and the large
antlers on the male deer are characteristics that are selective
disadvantages in the animals’ natural environment but are selective
advantages when it comes to courtship and mating. This is because
females of those species have a strong preference for excessive
adornment, refusing to mate with males who lack such augmentation.
Because these female preferences are also oȇen heritable, sexual
selection can lead to rapid evolution of a population.
AP EXPERT NOTE
The balance between survival and the ability to mate dictates how
species evolve.
One other type of selection is artificial selection, a process that plays an
active role in the domestication of plants and animals. Similar to sexual
selection (in which mate preference shapes evolution), choice also plays
a role in artificial selection but, in this case, it is the decisions of members
of another species (usually human beings), which are able to ex
