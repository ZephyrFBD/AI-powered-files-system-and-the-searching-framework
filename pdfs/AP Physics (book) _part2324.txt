 generators in that an electro-
magnet, called the rotor, is fed by current from the battery and is made to rotate
by a belt from the engine. The magnetic field of the turning rotor passes through
a surrounding set of stationary coils called the stator (Fig. 21–16), inducing an
alternating current in the stator coils, which is the output. This ac output is changed
to dc for charging the battery by the use of semiconductor diodes, which allow
current flow in one direction only.
Deriving the Generator Equation
Figure 21–17 shows the wire loop on a generator armature. The loop is being
made to rotate clockwise in a uniform magnetic field 
The velocity of the two
lengths ab and cd at this instant are shown. Although the sections of wire bc and da
are moving, the force on electrons in these sections is toward the side of the wire,
not along the wire’s length. The emf generated is thus due only to the force on
charges in the sections ab and cd. From right-hand-rule-3, we see that the direc-
