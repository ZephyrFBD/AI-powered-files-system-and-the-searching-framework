 (b) cancel for any point equidistant from 
and 
Thus the potential will be zero everywhere on the plane
equidistant between the two opposite charges. This plane is an equipotential
surface with V = 0.

Q1
17–6 Potential Due to Electric Dipole;
Dipole Moment
Two equal point charges Q, of opposite sign, separated by a distance 
are called
an electric dipole. The electric field lines and equipotential surfaces for a dipole
were shown in Fig. 17–7. Because electric dipoles occur often in physics, as well as
in other disciplines such as molecular biology, it is useful to examine them more
closely.
The electric potential at an arbitrary point P due to a dipole, Fig. 17–12, is the
sum of the potentials due to each of the two charges:
where r is the distance from P to the positive charge and 
is the distance 
to the negative charge. This equation becomes simpler if we consider points P
whose distance from the dipole is much larger than the separation of the two
charges—that is,
