me-catalyzed reactions. The effect of competitive
inhibitors can be diluted by adding higher concentrations of substrate, creating an environment where the substrate
can outcompete the competitive inhibitor.
Noncompetitive (or allosteric) inhibitors do not bind to the active site but rather bind to a different site on the
enzyme (called the allosteric site), see Figure 7.2. The binding of the noncompetitive inhibitor to the allosteric site
changes the shape of the enzyme, affecting its function. Because the noncompetitive inhibitor does not bind to the
active site of the enzyme, adding higher concentrations of substrate does not affect the action of a noncompetitive
inhibitor. Noncompetitive inhibitors can function in feedback mechanisms, adjusting the rate of chemical reactions
in the cell to suit changing environmental conditions.

Cofactors (inorganic molecules) and coenzymes (organic molecules) increase the efficiency o
