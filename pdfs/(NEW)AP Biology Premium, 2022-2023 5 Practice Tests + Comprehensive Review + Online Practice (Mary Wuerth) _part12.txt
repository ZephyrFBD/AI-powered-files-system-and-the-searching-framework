any topics of Unit 4
(such as cell communication, signal transduction, and the cell cycle) and in several topics of Unit 5 (including
Mendelian genetics and non-Mendelian genetics). Big Idea 3 is also included in every topic of Unit 6 (gene
expression and regulation). Finally, this concept is covered in Unit 8, when discussing ecological responses to
