The Rutherford model was unable to explain why atoms emit line spectra. It
had other difficulties as well. According to the Rutherford model, electrons orbit
the nucleus, and since their paths are curved the electrons are accelerating. Hence
they should give off light like any other accelerating electric charge (Chapt
