Third, we add Lewis electron dots to complete the octets on the atoms 
bonded to the central atom. Completing the octets around each

This structure gives each atom an octet, so we stop at this point. 
(In checking for octets, remember to count a single bond as two 
electrons.)
Fourth, recalling that our total number of electrons is 26, we place 
the remaining two electrons on the central atom, P
, which completes 
its octet:

Formal Charge and alternative Lewis Structures
When we draw a Lewis structure, we are describing how the electrons are distributed 
in a molecule or polyatomic ion. In some instances, we can draw two or more valid 
Lewis structures for a molecule that all obey the octet rule. All of these structures can be 
thought of as contributing to the actual arrangement of the electrons in the molecule, but 
not all of them will contribute to the same extent. How do we decide which one of sev-
eral
