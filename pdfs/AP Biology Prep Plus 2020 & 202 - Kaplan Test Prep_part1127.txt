neighboring plants on the rate of fungal colonization and
shoot biomass. Forty quadrants were divided into blocks and randomly
assigned factors: no treatment + neighbors, treatment + neighbors, no
treatment + isolated, and treatment + isolated. Samples were taken, and
soil oxygen concentration was measured for each block. The results are
shown in Figures 1 and 2.

Describe the relationship between plants and mycorrhizae.
(a)
Identify the control group in the experiment.
(b)
Determine the eﬀect fungicide and the presence of neighbors have on
shoot biomass.
(c)
Suppose oxygen concentration promotes mycorrhizal colonization.
Predict which plant species under what conditions would produce the
greatest amount of oxygen and justify your prediction.
