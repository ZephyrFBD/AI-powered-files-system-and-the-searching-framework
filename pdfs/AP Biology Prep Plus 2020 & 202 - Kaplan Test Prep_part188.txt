r substances are not blocked by the nonpolar fatty acid
portion of the membrane and can therefore pass through the
membrane without a channel protein, making (A) correct. (B) is
incorrect because fatty acid tails are nonpolar. Any substance can be
moved against its concentration gradient, so (C) is incorrect. Since the
molecules in process A can be nonpolar, (D) is incorrect.

The water potential is equal to the solute potential of a solute in an
open container because the pressure potential of the solution in an
open container is zero. Furthermore, because distilled water does not
contain any solutes, the solute potential, and therefore the water
potential, is equal to zero.
In the salt solution, the solute potential can be calculated using the
following equation (found in the formula sheet provided to you on Test
Day): ΨS = –iCRT. The ionization constant, i, is 2 because NaCl ionizes in
water to become Na+ and Cl–. The molar concentration, C, is 0.5 M,
