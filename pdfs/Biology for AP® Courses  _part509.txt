33. Which of these is a possible explanation for the
presence of a rigid cell wall in plants?
a.
Plants remain exposed to changes in temperature
and thus require rigid cell walls to protect
themselves.
b.
Plants are subjected to osmotic pressure and a
cell wall helps them against bursting or
shrinking.
c.
Plant cells have a rigid cell wall to protect
themselves from grazing animals.

influx of waste material.
34. Bacteria do not have organelles; yet, the same
reactions that take place on the mitochondria inner

a.
These reactions take place in the nucleoid of the
bacteria.
b.
These reactions occur in the cytopla
