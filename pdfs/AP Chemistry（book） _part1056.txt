d are highly conductive metals that react 
slowly, if at all, with air and water.
As we saw in Chapter 6, this behavior arises from repeating patterns of elec-
tron configuration. Elements in the same column contain the same number 
of electrons in their valence orbitalsâ€”the occupied orbitals that hold the 
electrons involved in bonding. While elements from the same column tend 
to have similar properties, every element has its own identity. Nowhere are 
the differences between elements belonging to the same column more appar-
ent than amongst the group 4A elements: carbon (C), silicon (Si), germanium 
(Ge), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb). Carbon is a nonmetal that comes in many differ-
ent forms, including diamond, one of the hardest known substances. Moving 
to the bottom of group 4A, we find lead, which is a relatively soft metal. Our 
bodies and those of nearly every living thing on planet Earth are made from 
molecules that contain carbon, while the toxicity of lead is well documented.
