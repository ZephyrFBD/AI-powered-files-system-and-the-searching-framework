NAs, and the mRNAs encode proteins. Although mRNA analysis is a step in the
right direction, not all mRNAs are translated into proteins. The study of the function of proteomes is called proteomics.
Proteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that were based on genes.
Even though all cells of a multicellular organism have the same set of genes, the set of proteins produced in different tissues
is different and dependent on gene expression. Thus, the genome is constant, but the proteome varies and is dynamic within
an organism. In addition, RNAs can be alternately spliced (cut and pasted to create novel combinations and novel proteins)
and many proteins are modified after translation by processes such as proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, glycosylation,
and ubiquitination. There are also protein-protein interactions, which complicate the study of proteomes. Although the
genome provides a blueprint, the final architecture depends on seve
