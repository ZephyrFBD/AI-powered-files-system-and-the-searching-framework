Given unit
The unit inches in the denominator of the conversion factor cancels the unit inches 
in the given data (8.50 inches), so that the centimeters unit in the numerator of the 
conversion factor becomes the unit of the final answer. Because the numerator and 
denominator of a conversion factor are equal, multiplying any quantity by a con-
version factor is equivalent to multiplying by the number 1 and so does not change 
the intrinsic value of the quantity. The length 8.50 in. is the same as the length 
 
21.6 cm.
In general, we begin any conversion by examining the units of the given data and 
the units we desire. We then ask ourselves what conversion factors we have available to 
take us from the units of the given quantity to those of the desired one. When we mul-
tiply a qu
