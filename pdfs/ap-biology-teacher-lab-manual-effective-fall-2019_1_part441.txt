Another difficulty that students have is understanding terms such as sister 
chromatids, tetrads, and chromosomes. Most diagrams of cells show duplicated 
chromosomes, meaning they are showing cells in G2 rather than in G1. You should 
explain that while the cells might have twice as much DNA in G2, they do not contain 
any more information, since the sister chromatids are copies. 
Ask your students to consider whether they resemble any family member and 
describe how their parents’ genetic information was passed onto them through gametes. 
Crossing over during meiosis is a difficult concept to grasp and is best illustrated using 
simple models and Sordaria asci formation.

You may assign the following for homework; as a think, pair/group, share activity, in 
which pairs or small groups of students brainstorm ideas and then share them with other 
groups; or as a whole-class discussion to assess students’ understanding of key co
