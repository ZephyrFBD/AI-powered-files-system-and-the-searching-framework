Figure 3.17 Saturated fatty acids have hydrocarbon chains connected by single bonds only. Unsaturated fatty acids
have one or more double bonds. Each double bond may be in a cis or trans configuration. In the cis configuration, both
hydrogens are on the same side of the hydrocarbon chain. In the trans configuration, the hydrogens are on opposite
sides. A cis double bond causes a kink in the chain.
Trans Fats
In the food industry, oils are artificially hydrogenated to make them semi-solid and of a consistency desirable for many
processed food products. Simply speaking, hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them. During this hydrogenation
process, double bonds of the cis- conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may be converted to double bonds in the trans-
conformation.
Margarine, some types of peanut butter, and shortening are examples of artificially hydrogenated trans fats. Recent studies
have shown that an increase in trans
