not great.
Beats. A tuning fork produces a steady 400-Hz tone. When
this tuning fork is struck and held near a vibrating guitar string, twenty beats 
are counted in five seconds. What are the possible frequencies produced by the
guitar string?
APPROACH For beats to occur, the string must vibrate at a frequency different
from 400 Hz by whatever the beat frequency is.
SOLUTION The beat frequency is
This is the difference of the frequencies of the two waves. Because one wave is
