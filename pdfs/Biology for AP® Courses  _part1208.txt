Introduction
The ability to reproduce “in kind” is a basic characteristic of all living things. “In kind” means that the offspring of an
organism closely resembles its parent or parents. Hippopotamuses give birth to hippopotamus calves, Joshua trees produce
Joshua tree seedlings, and flamingos lay eggs that hatch into flamingo chicks. In kind can mean exactly the same. Many
unicellular organisms, such as yeast, and a few multicellular organisms, such as sponges, can produce genetically identical
clones of themselves through cell division. However, many single-celled organisms and most multicellular organisms
reproduce regularly using a method requiring two parents. Sexual reproduction occurs through the production by each
parent of a haploid cell (containing one half of an offspring’s required genetic material) and th
