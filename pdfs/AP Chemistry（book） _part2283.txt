 is a difficult challenge. The cat-
alysts must be effective over a wide range of operating temperatures. 
They must continue to be active despite the fact that various compo-
nents of the exhaust can block the active sites of the catalyst. And the 
catalysts must be sufficiently rugged to withstand exhaust gas turbu-
lence and the mechanical shocks of driving under various conditions 
for thousands of miles.
Catalysts that promote the combustion of CO and hydrocarbons 
are, in general, the transition-metal oxides and the noble metals. 
These materials are supported on a structure (Figure 14.24) that allows 
the best possible contact between the flowing exhaust gas and the 
catalyst surface. A honeycomb structure made from alumina 1Al2O32 
and impregnated with the catalyst that is employed. Such catalysts 
operate by first adsorbing oxygen gas present in the exhaust gas. This 
adsorption weakens the OÂ¬O bond in O2, so that oxygen atoms are 
available for reaction with adsorbed CO to fo
