oﬀ the light, the
plants stop undergoing photosynthesis and instead begin to undergo
cellular respiration. Plant respiration consumes the oxygen bubbles
that had been generated during photosynthesis, causing the disks to
sink again as a result. This is best shown in (A). (B) and (D) can be
eliminated because the disks would not all sink immediately aȇer the
light was turned oﬀ. (C) can be eliminated because, aȇer the light is
turned oﬀ, the plants would naturally begin to undergo cellular
respiration, which would definitely aﬀect their buoyancy.

Before finding the diﬀerence between respiratory rates, the rates
themselves must be calculated. As stated in the question stem, these
rates can be calculated by finding the slopes of each experimental
group at seventeen minutes. The corrected values are used rather than
the original readings to account for any minute changes that may have
aﬀected the readings. The corrections are based on the glass beads
since gl
