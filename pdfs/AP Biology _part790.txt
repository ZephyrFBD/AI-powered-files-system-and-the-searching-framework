 mammals. Here is Jost’s procedure:
Jost surgically removed 50 rabbit embryos from 26 pregnant rabbits and
excised the part of the genital structures that would become gonads (testes
or ovaries). After the surgery, he placed the embryos back inside each
mother’s uterus, allowing them to develop to term. When the rabbit babies
were born, he recorded their chromosomal sex as well as whether their
genital structures developed as male or female. He also compared the
results to a control group of rabbit babies that were born from pregnant
rabbits that did not undergo any surgery.
Here are the results of his experiment:
 
Appearance of Genitalia in Rabbit Babies
Sex Chromosomes Present in Offspring
No Surgery (Control Group)
Embryonic Gonad Removed
XY
Male
Female
XX
Female
Female
Which of the following statements best explains what Jost’s
experiment demonstrated?
In the absence of a signal from male gonads, all embryos
develop as male, regardless of whether they are genetically
male (XY) or
