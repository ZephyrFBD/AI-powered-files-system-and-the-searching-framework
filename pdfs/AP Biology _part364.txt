CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter advanced the discussion presented in Big Idea: IST. It
details how genetic information gets from one generation to the
next via DNA. It includes the historic search for heritable material,
DNA structure, replication, transcription, translation, and regulation
of genes.
The work of many scientists carrying out a myriad of experiments
proved that DNA, not protein, is the heritable material. You must
understand and be able to analyze the work or experiments of
Griffith, Avery, Franklin, Watson and Crick, and Meselson and
Stahl.
The DNA molecule consists of a double helix, a polymer of
repeating units of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar
(deoxyribose), a phosphate, and a nitrogen base: adenine (A),
guanine (G), cytosine (C), or thymine (T). Inside a nucleus, DNA
is packa
