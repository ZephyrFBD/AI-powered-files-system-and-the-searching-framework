disk-lab/. 
The steps in the first part of the lab require teacher direction to familiarize 
students with the floating disk system or computer-based sensors. The final part of 
the investigation requires less teacher direction and instruction, the degree to which 
depends on conceptual understanding and the skill level of the students. 
If students are to be successful in the final part, in which they design and conduct 
their own investigations, it is essential that they have success in sinking their leaf disks. 
Attention to this task generally is the deciding variable that points to positive student 
outcomes. 
■ THE INVESTIGATIONS 
■ Getting Started: Prelab Assessment 
Investigating biology requires a variety of skills. The skills reinforced and introduced 
vary across the laboratories in this manual. The skills emphasized in a laboratory dictate 
whether a prelab assessment is appropriate.
