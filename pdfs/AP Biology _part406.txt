 updated as new information is
discovered. Ingroups is the term used for the organisms that are
being compared, while outgroups are not closely related to the
ingroups and are on a separate clade. Outgroups are included
merely for comparison. All organisms share traits with their
ancestors and also have evolved new and different traits. The traits
or characteristics an organism shares with its ancestors are called
shared ancestral traits, while new traits are called derived traits.
On a cladogram, all organisms that share a new derived trait are
located on one branch or clade.
Be able to analyze and evaluate a phylogenetic tree, and be able to
construct your own. Study Table 10.4, which presents the data used
to construct the phylogenetic tree in Figure 10.4.
