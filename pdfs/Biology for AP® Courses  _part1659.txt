ent polymerases. Unlike in prokaryotes, elongation by RNA
polymerase II in eukaryotes takes place 1,000–2,000 nucleotides beyond the end of the gene being transcribed. This pre-
mRNA tail is subsequently removed by cleavage during mRNA processing. On the other hand, RNA polymerases I and

III require termination signals. Genes transcribed by RNA polymerase I contain a specific 18-nucleotide sequence that is
recognized by a termination protein. The process of termination in RNA polymerase III involves an mRNA hairpin similar
to rho-independent termination of transcription in prokaryotes.

In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are the steps in eukaryotic transcription?
•
What are the structural and functional similarities and differences among the three RNA polymerase
