hat create a large surface area over which gas
exchange occurs. Inside the gills, a circulatory system removes the oxygen and delivers waste CO2. In some
animals, such as polychaete worms (Annelida), the gills are external and unprotected. In other animals, the gills are
internal and protected. In fish, for example, water enters the mouth, passes over the gills, and exits through the gill
cover, or operculum. Countercurrent exchange between the opposing movements of water and the underlying
blood through blood vessels maximizes the diffusion of O2 into the blood and CO2 into the water.
 
3. Tracheae. Insects have chitin-lined tubes, or tracheae, that permeate
 
their bodies. Oxygen enters (or CO2 exits) the tracheae through
 
openings called spiracles; diffusion occurs across moistened tracheal endings.
4. Lungs. Lungs are invaginated structures, or cavities, within the body of the animal. Book lungs, occurring in
many spiders, are stacks of flattened membranes enclosed in an internal
