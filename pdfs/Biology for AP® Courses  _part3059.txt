d potassium ions (K+) inside and outside the cell dominates the
resting membrane potential (Figure 26.10). When the membrane is at rest, K+ ions accumulate inside the cell due to a net
movement with the concentration gradient. The negative resting membrane potential is created and maintained by increasing
the concentration of cations outside the cell (in the extracellular fluid) relative to inside the cell (in the cytoplasm). The
negative charge within the cell is created by the cell membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than
sodium ion movement. In neurons, potassium ions are maintained at high concentrations within the cell while sodium ions
are maintained at high concentrations outside of the cell. The cell possesses potassium and sodium leakage channels that
allow the two cations to diffuse down their concentration gradient. However, the neurons have far more potassium leakage
channels than sodium leakage channels. Therefore, potassium diffuses out of the cell at
