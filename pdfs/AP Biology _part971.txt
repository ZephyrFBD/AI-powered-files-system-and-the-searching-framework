The table below shows the results of a breeding experiment that
examined the inheritance of flower color (red or white) and pod
shape (smooth or wrinkled). True-breeding parents were crossed to
produce F1 offspring, which were then testcrossed with homozygous
recessive individuals.
The ratio of phenotypes in the offspring from the testcross with F1
plants that had red flowers and smooth pods suggests that the genes
for flower c
