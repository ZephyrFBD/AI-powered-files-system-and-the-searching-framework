hich consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded
by negatively charged electrons. Each electron has a charge
Electric conductors are those materials in which many
electrons are relatively free to move, whereas electric insulators
or nonconductors are those in which very few electrons are
free to move.
An object is negatively charged when it has an excess of
electrons, and positively charged when it has less than its
normal number of electrons. The net charge on any object is a
whole number times 
or 
That is, charge is quantized.
An object can become charged by rubbing (in which
electrons are transferred from one material to another),
by conduction (which is transfer of charge from one charged
object to another by touching), or by induction (the separation
of charge within an object because of the close approach of
another charged object but without touching).
Electric charges exert a force on each other. If two charges
are of opposite types, one positive and one negative, they
