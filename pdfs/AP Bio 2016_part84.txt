bition of CDK5 activity in neurons 
increases the movement of synaptic vesicles 
to the plasma membrane in response to a 
specific stimulus. 
46. Based on the model, which of the following
describes the most likely mechanism by which
CDK5 regulates neurotransmitter release?
(A) CDK5 adds methyl groups to DNA, altering
expression of genes required for synthesis 
of neurotransmitters. 
(B) CDK5 promotes the rearrangement of the 
lipid molecules of two bilayers into a single 
membrane. 
(C) CDK5 alters the activity of other proteins 
involved in the movement of synaptic 
vesicles to the plasma membrane. 
(D) CDK5 binds to gated ion channels in the 
postsynaptic membrane, resulting in 
diffusion of calcium ions. 
47. Previous experiments indicate that CDK5 is active
only when attached to a protein called p35. Which
of the following best predicts how p35 might play
a role in regulating neuron function?
(A) Elevated intracellular levels of p35 result in
increased synaptic activity. 
(B) Degr
