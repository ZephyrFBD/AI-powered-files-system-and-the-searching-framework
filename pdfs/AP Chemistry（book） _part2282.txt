ays a major role in the fight against urban 
air pollution. Two components of automobile exhausts that help form 
photochemical smog are nitrogen oxides and unburned hydrocarbons. 
In addition, automobile exhaust may contain considerable quantities 
of carbon monoxide. Even with the most careful attention to engine 
design, it is impossible under normal driving conditions to reduce the 
quantity of these pollutants to an acceptable level in the exhaust gases. It 
is therefore necessary to remove them from the exhaust before they are 
vented to the air. This removal is accomplished in the catalytic converter.
The catalytic converter, which is part of an automobile’s 
exhaust system, must perform two functions: (1) oxidation of CO 
and unburned hydrocarbons 1CxHy2 to carbon dioxide and water, 
and (2) reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen gas:
CO, CxHy ¡
O2
CO2 + H2O
NO, NO2 ¡ N2 + O2
These two functions require different catalysts, so the develop-
ment of a successful catalyst system
