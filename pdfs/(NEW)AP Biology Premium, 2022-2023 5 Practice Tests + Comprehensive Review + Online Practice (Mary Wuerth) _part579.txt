ioinformatics tools available is BLASTâ€”Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. BLAST compares molecular data
on DNA and amino acid sequences to a large databank of sequences at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The
BLAST algorithm can compare any DNA or amino acid sequence to millions of sequences in the databank in just a
few seconds. This can give scientists valuable information about the functions of similar genes. For example, if a
DNA sequence of a newly identified gene has a high degree of homology with a mouse gene that is involved in cell
signaling, this could indicate that the newly identified gene may have a function in cell signaling.
Species with a more recent common ancestor will share a greater degree of homology in their genes. Using
BLAST to compare genes shared by different species can help scientists determine degree of relatedness and
construct phylogenetic trees. Fewer nucleotide differences between species indicate a more recent common ancestor.
For example, comp
