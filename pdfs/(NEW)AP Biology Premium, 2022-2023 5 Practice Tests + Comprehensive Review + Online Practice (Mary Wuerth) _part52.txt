6. A student wanted to see if isopods preferred banana or watermelon as a food source. Twenty isopods were
placed in the center of a choice chamber with two compartments. Banana was placed in one compartment, and
watermelon was placed in the second compartment. After 15 minutes, the number of isopods in each
compartment was counted. Data are shown in the table.

The null hypothesis was that the isopods would have no food preference and would be found in equal numbers
in both compartments. Calculate the chi-square value (using a p-value of 0.05), and determine if there was a
statistically significant difference between the observed and expected data in this experiment.
(A) The chi-square value is 0.80. There is a statistically significant difference between the observed and
expected data.
(B) The chi-square value is 0.80. There is NOT a statistically significant differenc
