wed for the discovery of many viruses of all types
of living organisms. They were initially grouped by shared morphology. Later, groups of viruses were classified by the type
of nucleic acid they contained, DNA or RNA, and whether their nucleic acid was single- or double-stranded. More recently,
molecular analysis of viral replicative cycles has further refined their classification.

Evolution of Viruses
Although biologists have accumulated a significant amount of knowledge about how present-day viruses evolve, much
less is known about how viruses originated in the first place. When exploring the evolutionary histor
