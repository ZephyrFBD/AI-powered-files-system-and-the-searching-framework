at each corner of a square
0.100 m on a side. Determine the magnitude and direction
of the force on each charge.
15. (II) At each corner of a square of side 
there are point
charges of magnitude Q, 2Q, 3Q, and
4Q (Fig. 16–54). Determine the mag-
nitude and direction of the force on
the charge 2Q.

Problem 15.
16. (II) A large electroscope is made with “leaves” that are
78-cm-long wires with tiny 21-g spheres at the ends. When
charged, nearly all the charge resides on the spheres. If the
wires each make a 26° angle with
the vertical (Fig. 16–55), what
total charge Q must have been
applied to the electroscope?
Ignore the mass of the wires.
17. (III) Two small nonconducting spheres have a total charge
of 
(a) When placed 28.0 cm apart, the force each
exerts on the other is 12.0 N and is repulsive. What is the
charge on each? (b) What if the force were attractive?
18. (III) Two charges,
and 
are a distance 
apart.
These two charges are free to move but do n
