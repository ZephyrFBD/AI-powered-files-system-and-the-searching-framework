the top and bottom cells result in cytoplasmic differences and contribute to
developmental differences among cells.
Questions 15-18 refer to water potential, Ψ, as expressed by the following formula:
Ψ = Ψp + Ψs
 
where
 
Ψp = pressure potential and
 
Ψs = solute (or osmotic) potential.
 
The following questions refer to a section of a freshly cut potato that is put into a beaker of distilled water. Use the
following key for questions 15-17.
A. is greater than 0
B. is equal to 0
C. is less than 0
D. is the same in the distilled water as it is in the potato cell
15. The value of Ψ for the distilled water before the potato is added
 
16. The value of Ψs inside a potato cell before it is added to the water 17. The value of Ψp inside a potato cell before
it is added to the water
 
18. Soon after the potato section is added to the water
 
A. the value of Ψ for a potato cell will decrease because water moves into the potato cell
 
B. the value of Ψs for a potato cell will decrease because wa
