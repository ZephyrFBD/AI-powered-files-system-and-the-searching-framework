 or in supernova explosions, there is enough initial kinetic energy
available to drive endothermic reactions that produce heavier elements as well.
EXERCISE E If the Sun is generating a constant amount of energy via fusion, the mass
of the Sun must be (a) increasing, (b) decreasing, (c) constant, (d) irregular.
Possible Fusion Reactors
The possibility of utilizing the energy released in fusion to make a power reactor
is very attractive. The fusion reactions most likely to succeed in a reactor involve
the isotopes of hydrogen,
(deuterium) and 
(tritium), and are as follows,
with the energy released given in parentheses:
(31;8a)
(31;8b)
(31;8c)
Comparing these energy yields with that for the fission of 
we can see that the
energy released in fusion reactions can be greater for a given mass of fuel than in
fission. Furthermore, as fuel, a fusion reactor could use deuterium, which is very
plentiful in the water of the oceans (the natural abundance of 
is 0.0115% on
average, or about 1 g of
