and propane 1CH3CH2CH3, MW 44 amu, bp 231 K2. Acetonitrile is a polar molecule, with 
a dipole moment of 3.9 D, so dipole–dipole interactions are present. However, propane is 
essentially nonpolar, which means that dipole–dipole interactions are absent. Because 
acetonitrile and propane have similar molecular weights, dispersion forces are similar for 
these two molecules. Therefore, the higher boiling point of acetonitrile can be attributed 
to dipole–dipole interactions.

To better understand these forces, consider how CH3CN molecules pack together in 
the solid and liquid states. In the solid [Figure 11.7(a)], the molecules are arranged with the 
negatively charged nitrogen end
