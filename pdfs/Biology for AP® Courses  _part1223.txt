the first source of genetic variation in the nuclei produced by meiosis. A single crossover
event between homologous non-sister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent DNA between a maternal
chromosome and a paternal chromosome. Now, when that sister chromatid is moved into a gamete cell it will carry some
DNA from one parent of the individual and some DNA from the other parent. The sister recombinant chromatid has a
combination of maternal and paternal genes that did not exist before the crossover. Multiple crossovers in an arm of the
chromosome have the same effect, exchanging segments of DNA to create recombinant chromosomes.

Figure 11.3 Crossover occurs between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. The result is an exchange
of genetic material between homologous chromosomes.
