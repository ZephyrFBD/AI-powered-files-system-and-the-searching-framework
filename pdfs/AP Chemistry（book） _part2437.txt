 possible to change the pressure of a system in which a chemical reaction is run-
ning without changing its volume. For example, pressure increases if additional amounts 
of any reacting components are added to the system. We have already seen how to deal 
with a change in concentration of a reactant or product. However, the total pressure in 
the reaction vessel might also be increased by adding a gas that is not involved in the 
equilibrium. For example, argon might be added to the ammonia equilibrium system. 
The argon would not alter the partial pressures of any of the reacting components and 
therefore would not cause a shift in equilibrium.
Increase volume,
decrease pressure
