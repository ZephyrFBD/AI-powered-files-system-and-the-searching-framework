of genes that produce two transcription factors (NtcA and
HetR) that promote the expression of genes responsible for
heterocyst development. HetR also causes production of a
signal, PatS, that prevents adjacent cells from developing
as heterocysts. Based on your understanding of the ways in
which signal transmission mediates cell function, which of
the following predictions is most consistent with the
information given above?

a.
In an environment with low fixed nitrogen,
treating the Anabaena cells with a calcium-
binding compound should prevent heterocyst
differentiation.
b.
A strain that overexpresses the patS gene should
develop many more heterocysts in a low
nitrogen environment.
c.
In an environment with abundant fixed nitrogen,
free calcium levels should be high in all cells,
preventing heterocysts from developing.
d.
In environments with abundant fixed nitrogen,
loss of the hetR gene should induce heterocyst
development.
