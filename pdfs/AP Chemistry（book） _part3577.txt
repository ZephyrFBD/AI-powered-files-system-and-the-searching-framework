In the laboratory, CO2 can be produced by the action of acids on carbonates (Figure 22.30):
 
CO3
2 -1aq2 + 2 H+1aq2 ¡ CO21g2 + H2O1l2

Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas. It is a minor component of Earth’s atmo-
sphere but a major contributor to the greenhouse effect. 
 (Section 18.2) Although 
it is not toxic, high concentrations of CO2 increase respiration rate and can cause suf-
focation. It is readily liquefied by compression. When cooled at atmospheric pressure, 
however, CO2 forms a solid rather than liquefying. The solid sublimes at atmospheric 
pressure at -78 °C. This property makes solid CO2, known as dry ice, valuable as a refrig-
erant. About half of the CO2 consumed annually is used for refrigeration. The other 
major use of CO2 is in the production of carbonated beverages. Large quantities are also 
used to manufacture washing soda 1Na2CO3 # 10 H2O2, used to precipi
