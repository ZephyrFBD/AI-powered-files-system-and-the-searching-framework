s how the amino acid would
interact with the aqueous environment of the cell. All amino acids contain a carboxyl group. An amino group
and a hydrogen atom are attached to the central carbon but are less likely to affect the interaction of an amino
acid with the aqueous environment of the cell. For those reasons, choices (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect.
45. (D) Signal amplification involves one signaling molecule (also known as a ligand) triggering multiple chemical
reactions, magnifying the effect of the chemical signal. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they
each involve one reaction triggering just one event.
46. (C) DNA replication occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle. Choices (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect
because DNA replication does not occur during those phases.
47. (B) Positive feedback occurs when the stimulus increases the response and moves the condition further away
from homeostasis. Choice (A) is incorrect because it is an example of the formation of
