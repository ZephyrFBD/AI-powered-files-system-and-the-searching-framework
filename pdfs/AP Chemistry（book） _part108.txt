Hundreds of new Enhanced EoC questions with wrong-answer-response feedback
Design An Experiment feature 
provides a departure from the usual 
kinds of end-of-chapter exercises with 
an inquiry-based, open-ended approach 
that tries to stimulate the student to 
“think like a scientist.” Designed to 
foster critical thinking, each exercise 
presents the student with a scenario 
in which various unknowns require 
investigation. The student is called upon 
to ponder how experiments might be 
set up to provide answers to particular 
questions about observations.
Adaptive follow-Up 
Assignments allow 
instructors to deliver content 
to students–automatically 
personalized for each 
individual based on the 
strengths and weaknesses 
identified by his or her 
performance on initial 
Mastering assignments.
