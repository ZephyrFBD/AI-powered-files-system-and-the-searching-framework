 between membrane-bound molecules is the basis of the
human immune system. See Figures 15.1 and 15.3.

Local Signaling
There are three types of local signaling by cells:
PARACRINE SIGNALING—where chemical signals travel a relatively
short distance. See the discussion of embryonic induction,
whereby one layer of cells induces a nearby layer to transform into
another cell type, on page 397.
SYNAPTIC SIGNALING—where an axon of a nerve cell releases
neurotransmitters. See the discussion of neurons on page 352.
AUTOCRINE SIGNALING—where helper T cells release cytokines that

signal themselves to release more cytokines. See the discussion of
the immune system on page 369.
Long-Distance Signaling
Plants use chemicals called hormones for long-distance signaling. In
animals, the endocrine system has endocrine glands to release hormones in
the blood to reach target organs or structures. Another example of long-
distance signali
