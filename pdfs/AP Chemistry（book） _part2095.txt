blood at 25 °C is 7.7 atm.
Plan Because we are given the osmotic pressure and temperature, 
we can solve for the concentration, using Equation 13.14. Because 
glucose is a nonelectrolyte, i = 1.

Comment In clinical situations, the concentrations of solutions are 
generally expressed as mass percentages. The mass percentage of a 
0.31 M solution of glucose is 5.3%. The concentration of NaCl that 
is isotonic with blood is 0.16 M, because i = 2 for NaCl in water  
(a 0.155 M solution of NaCl is 0.310 M in particles). A 0.16 M solu-
tion of NaCl is 0.9% mass in NaCl. This kind of solution is known 
as a physiological saline solution.
