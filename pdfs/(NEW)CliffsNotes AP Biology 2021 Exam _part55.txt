OH), and a hydrogen
atom ( Figure 2-9). The fourth bond of the central carbon is shown with the letter R, which indicates an atom or
group of atoms that varies from one kind of amino acid to another. For the simplest amino acid, glycine, the R is
a hydrogen atom. For serine, R is CH2OH. For other amino acids, R may
 
contain sulfur (as in cysteine) or a carbon ring (as in phenylalanine).
 
The protein, then, is a polymer of different amino acids with −NH2at one
end and −COOH at the other end. Each amino acid carries an R group with specific properties. For example, the R
group may make the amino acid hydrophobic or hydrophilic, polar or nonpolar, or acidic or basic. As a result,
proteins can differ widely in structure (size and shape), which, in turn, makes for dramatic differences in protein
function.

amino acid, th
