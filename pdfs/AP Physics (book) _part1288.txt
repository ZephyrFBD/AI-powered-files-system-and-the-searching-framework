s of Sound: Vibrating
Strings and Air Columns
The source of any sound is a vibrating object. Almost any object can vibrate and
hence be a source of sound. We now discuss some simple sources of sound, partic-
ularly musical instruments. In musical instruments, the source is set into vibration
by striking, plucking, bowing, or blowing. Standing waves are produced and the
source vibrates at its natural resonant frequencies. The vibrating source is in contact
with the air (or other medium) and pushes on it to produce sound waves that travel
outward. The frequencies of the waves are the same as those of the source, but
the speed and wavelengths can be different. A drum has a stretched membrane
that vibrates. Xylophones and marimbas have metal or wood bars that can be 
set into vibration. Bells, cymbals, and gongs also make use of a vibrating metal.
Many instruments make use of vibrating strings, such as the violin, guitar, and
piano, or make use of vibrating columns of air, such as the flut
