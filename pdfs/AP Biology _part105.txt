reactions that begins with one molecule of epinephrine binding to a
receptor and ending with thousands of molecules of glucose released into
the bloodstream.

Ultimately, signal transduction pathways lead to a multitude of responses,
either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. Many signaling pathways
regulate protein synthesis by turning specific genes on or off. Regardless
of the outcome, you need to remember five things about signal
transduction pathways.
They are characterized by a signal, a transduction, and a response.
They are highly specific and regulated.
One signal molecule can cause a cascade effect, releasing
thousands of molecules inside a cell.
They regulate cellular activity, altering gene expression, protein
activity, or protein synthesis.
These pathways evolved millions of years ago in a common
ancestor.
