phage (a virus that infects bacteria). Bacteriophages undergo two different
types of replication cycles, the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle. In the lytic cycle, the virus immediately starts
using the host cell’s machinery to replicate the genetic material and create more capsid proteins. These
spontaneously assemble into mature viruses and cause the cell to lyse, or break open, releasing new viruses into the
environment. In the lysogenic cycle, the virus incorporates itself into the host genome and remains dormant until it
is triggered to switch into the lytic cycle. A virus can hide in the genome of a host cell for a very long time. During
this time, the cell may divide and replicate the virus as well. By the time the lytic cycle is triggered, the virus may
have been replicated many many times as the cell hosting it divides.
When a virus excises from a host genome (becomes unintegrated), it sometimes accidentally takes some of the
bacterial cell’s DNA with it. Then, the host DNA
