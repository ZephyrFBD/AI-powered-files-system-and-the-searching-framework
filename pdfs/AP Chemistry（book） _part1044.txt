dy scattering of this 
kind. He showed that the amount of scattering for very small 
particles such as molecules is inversely proportional to the 
fourth power of the wavelength. Estimate the ratio of the scat-
tering efficiency of light at the wavelength of the maximum 
for the “blue” cones, as compared with that for the “green” 
cones. (c) Explain why the sky appears blue even though all 
wavelengths of solar light are scattered by the atmosphere.
 6.91  The series of emission lines of the hydrogen atom for which 
nf = 3 is called the Paschen series. (a) Determine the region 
of the electromagnetic spectrum in which the lines of the 
Paschen series are observed. (b) Calculate the wavelengths 
of the ﬁrst three lines in the Paschen series—those for which 
ni = 4, 5, and 6.
 6.92  When the spectrum of light from the Sun is examined in high 
resolution in an experiment similar to that illustrated in Fig-
ure 6.9, dark lines are evident. These are called Fraunhofer 
lines, after the scie
