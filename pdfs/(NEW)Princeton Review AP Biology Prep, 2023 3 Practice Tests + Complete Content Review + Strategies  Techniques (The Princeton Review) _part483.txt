ow p-values are calculated and t-tests are performed is not important here. Instead,
it’s important that you understand how these values are used to interpret data.
Let’s work through an example to demonstrate how common statistics are used in biological labs.
A researcher has sections of two different types of skin cancers from human patients. She stains them for the protein
CD31, which is a marker of endothelial cells. She then takes digital pictures of the immunofluorescent sections and
counts the number of blood vessels present in each picture. She takes five pictures of each slide.

(a) ​ What is the mean, median, and mode for each dataset?
(b) ​ The standard error of group A is 0.735, and the standard error for group B is 0.400. What does this tell you
about the data?
(c) ​ What assumptions are made about the data in performing these tests?
(d) ​ What could the researcher do to increase her confidence in the results?
Solutions:
