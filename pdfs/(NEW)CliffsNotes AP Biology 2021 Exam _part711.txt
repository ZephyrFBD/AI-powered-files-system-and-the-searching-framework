xide. When these substances react with water vapor, they produce
sulfuric acid and nitric acid. When these acids return to the surface of the earth (with rain or snow), they acidify soils
and bodies of water, decreasing pH and adversely affecting plants and animals in lakes and rivers and on land.
4. Desertification. Overgrazing of grasslands that border deserts transform the grasslands into deserts. As a result,
agricultural output decreases, or habitats available to native species are lost.
5. Deforestation. Clear-cutting of forests causes erosion, flooding, and changes in weather patterns. The slash-and-
burn method of clearing
 
tropical rain forests for agriculture increases atmospheric CO2, which
contributes to the greenhouse effect. Because most of the nutrients in a tropical rain forest are stored in the
vegetation, burning the forest destroys the nutrients. As a result, the soil of some rain forests can support agriculture
for only one or two years.
6. Pollution. Air pollution
