H2O and CO2 are trapped
in separate absorbers
Solve Because all of the carbon in the sample is converted to CO2, we can use dimensional  
analysis and the following steps to calculate the 
mass C in the sample.

Quantitative Information  
from Balanced Equations
The coefficients in a chemical equation represent the relative numbers of molecules in 
a reaction. The mole concept allows us to convert this information to the masses of the 
substances in the reaction. For instance, the coefficients in the  
balanced equation
