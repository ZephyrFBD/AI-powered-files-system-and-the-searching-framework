lowing species composition: no salmon or black bears (N), bears but not salmon (B), 
salmon but not bears (S), and a plot where salmon and bears interact (SB). Nitrogen influx in the different sampling 
areas was measured as a means of assessing the impact of the different species on the health of the ecosystem. The 
data are plotted in Figure 1. 
6. Which of the following statements is best
supported by the data?
(A) Black bears are a keystone species.
(B) Salmon are a keystone species.
(C) Black bear urine is a significant source of
nitrogen in the environment. 
(D) The presence of black bears and salmon
correlates with a significant increase in 
nitrogen influx. 
7. Which of the following most likely describes
how the interaction between bears and salmon
influences nitrogen dynamics in the environment?
(A) When bears consume salmon, they leave
parts of the carcasses on the ground, which 
decompose, releasing nitrogen into the 
environment. 
(B) When salmon swim upstream to spawn, be
