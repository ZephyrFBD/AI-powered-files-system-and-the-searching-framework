the same branch as species D.
12. (a) This is a type of habitat isolation because the two species are separated by the river into different habitats.
(b) The greater the percentage of homology of DNA between two species, the more recently they shared a
common ancestor.
(c) After the river that once separated the two species dries up, members of the two ground squirrel species will
be able to interbreed with each other.
(d) Since the degree of homology in the DNA between the two species is very high, they probably diverged
relatively recently, so there is a good likelihood they will be able to interbreed and produce fertile offspring.
With the elimination of the river that once separated them, they will be able to come into contact with one
another and interbreed.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) Males with bird songs of shorter durations (less than 120 seconds) will be approached by fewer females
than males with bird songs of 120 seconds or more in duration.
(b) Bird songs are a type of beha
