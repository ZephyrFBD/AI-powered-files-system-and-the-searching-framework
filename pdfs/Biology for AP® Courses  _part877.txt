7.7 Regulation of Cellular Respiration
Cellular respiration is controlled by a variety of means. The entry of glucose into a cell is controlled by the transport
proteins that aid glucose passage through the cell membrane. Most of the control of the respiration processes is
accomplished through the control of specific enzymes in the pathways. This is a type of negative feedback, turning the
enzymes off. The enzymes respond most often to the levels of the available nucleosides ATP, ADP, AMP, NAD+, and
FAD. Other intermediates of the pathway also affect certain enzymes in the systems.
