Figure 11.10 Plants have a life cycle that alternates between a multicellular haploid organism and a multicellular
diploid organism. In some plants, such as ferns, both the haploid and diploid plant stages are free-living. The diploid
plant is called a sporophyte because it produces haploid spores by meiosis. The spores develop into multicellular,
haploid plants called gametophytes because they produce gametes. The gametes of two individuals will fuse to form
a diploid zygote that becomes the sporophyte. (credit “fern”: modification of work by Cory Zanker; credit “sporangia”:
