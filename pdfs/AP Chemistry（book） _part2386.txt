n terms of activities rather than concentra-
tions or partial pressures.
The activity of any substance in an ideal mixture is the ratio of the concentration 
or pressure of the substance either to a reference concentration 11 M2 or to a reference 
pressure (1 atm). For example, if the concentration of a substance in an equilibrium mix-
ture is 0.010 M, its activity is 0.010 M>1 M = 0.010. The units of such ratios always can-
cel and, consequently, activities have no units. Furthermore, the numerical value of the 
activity equals the concentration. For pure solids and pure liquids, the situation is even 
simpler because the activities then merely equal 1 (again with no units).
In real systems, activities are also ratios that have no units. Even though these activ-
ities may not be exactly numerically equal to concentrations, we will assume those dif-
ferences are small enough that we can neglect them. All we need to know at this point 
is that activities have no units. As a result, the
