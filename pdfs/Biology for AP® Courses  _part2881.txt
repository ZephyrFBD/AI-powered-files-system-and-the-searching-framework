25. What is the relationship between basal metabolic rate
(BMR) and body size? Why?

a.
BMR decreases with body size, because larger
animals require more energy to maintain their
size. However, smaller animals have relatively
higher BMRs per body weight because they
have greater surface area.
b.
BMR increases with body size, because smaller
animals require more energy to maintain their
size. However, lar
