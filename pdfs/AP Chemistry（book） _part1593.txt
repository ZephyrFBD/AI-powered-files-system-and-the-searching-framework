SOLUTION
Analyze This is a multistep problem. We are given the volume, 
pressure, and temperature of the N2 gas and the chemical equa-
tion for the reaction by which the N2 is generated. We must use 
this information to calculate the number of grams of NaN3 needed 
to obtain the necessary N2.
Plan We need to use the gas data (P, V, and T) and the ideal-gas 
equation to calculate the number of moles of N2 gas that should 
be formed for the air bag to operate correctly. We can then use the 
balanced equation to determine the number of moles of NaN3 
needed. Finally, we can convert moles of NaN3 to grams.
Automobile air bags are inflated by nitrogen gas generated by the rapid decomposition of sodium azide, NaN3:
2 NaN31s2 ¡ 2 Na1s2 + 3 N21g2
If an air bag has a volume of 36 L and is to be filled with nitrogen gas at 1.15 atm and 26 °C, how many grams of NaN3 
must be decomposed?
