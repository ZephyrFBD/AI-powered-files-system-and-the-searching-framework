tube filled with a halogen gas (bromine or
iodine) which allows longer filament life and
higher filament temperature for greater
efficiency and whiteness.

Electric Cars
Considerable research is being done to improve batteries for electric cars and for
hybrids (which use both a gasoline internal combustion engine and an electric
motor). One type of battery is lithium-ion, in which the anode contains lithium
