Measurement of the dipole moments can provide us with valuable information about 
the charge distributions in molecules, as illustrated in Sample Exercise 8.5.
The bond length in the HCl molecule is 1.27 Å. (a) Calculate the dipole moment, in debyes, that results if the charges on the 
H and Cl atoms were 1+ and 1- respectively. (b) The experimentally measured dipole moment of HCl(g) is 1.08 D. What 
magnitude of charge, in units of e, on the H and Cl atoms leads to this dipole moment?
Analyze and Plan We are asked in part (a) to calculate the dipole 
moment of HCl that would result if there were a full charge trans-
ferred from H to Cl. We can use Equation 8.10 to obtain this result. 
In part (b), we are given the actual dipole moment for the mole-
cule and will use that value to calculate the actual partial charges 
on the H and Cl atoms.
