he Mass Spectrometer”) The mass spectrum showed peaks 
corresponding to clusters of carbon atoms, with a particularly strong peak corresponding 
to molecules composed of 60 carbon atoms, C60.
Because C60 clusters were so preferentially formed, the group proposed a radically 
different form of carbon, namely, nearly spherical C60 molecules. They proposed that the 
carbon atoms of C60 form a “ball” with 32 faces, 12 of them pentagons and 20 hexagons 
(Figure 12.49), exactly like a soccer ball. The shape of this molecule is reminiscent of the 
geodesic dome invented by the U.S. engineer and philosopher R. Buckminster Fuller, so 
C60 was whimsically named “buckminsterfullerene,” or “buckyball” for short. Since the 
discovery of C60, other related molecules made of pure carbon have been discovered. 
These molecules are now known as fullerenes.
Appreciable amounts of buckyball can be prepared by electrically evaporating 
graphite in an atmosphere of helium gas. About 14% of the resulting soo
