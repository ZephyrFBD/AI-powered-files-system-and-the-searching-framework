14. A very elastic “superball” is dropped from a height h onto a
hard steel plate (fixed to the Earth), from which it rebounds
at very nearly its original speed. (a) Is the momentum of the

consider the ball and the Earth as our system, during what
parts of the process is momentum conserved? (c) Answer
