irus that infects a population of producers (i.e., grass 
species) could result in a decrease in consumer population 
size as less energy is available for the higher tropic levels. 
Similarly, the student may explain how the reproductive rate 
in uninfected plants likely increases due to more available 
resources with the death of infected plants.
(Part d) The student is able to predict several potential 
effects — both negative and positive — of long-term change 
due to a viral infection on the plant population and prairie 
community and justify those predictions. For example, the 
student may explain how the loss of infected plants reduces 
genetic variability of the grass species, or may describe 
how the loss of prairie grass increases erosion, resulting 
in degradation of the abiotic environment. Similarly, the 
student may predict with justification how changes in allele 
frequencies in the infected plants lead to natural selection 
and evolution or that if the affected grass is
