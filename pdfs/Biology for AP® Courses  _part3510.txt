ads align on either side of the thick filament where the thin filaments overlap. The primary component
of thin filaments is the actin protein. Two other components of the thin filament are tropomyosin and troponin. Actin has
binding sites for myosin attachment. Strands of tropomyosin block the binding sites and prevent actin–myosin interactions
when the muscles are at rest. Troponin consists of three globular subunits. One subunit binds to tropomyosin, one subunit

Sliding Filament Model of Contraction
For a muscle cell to contract, the sarcomere must shorten. However, thick and thin filaments—the components of
sarcomeres—do not shorten. Instead, they slide by one another, causi
