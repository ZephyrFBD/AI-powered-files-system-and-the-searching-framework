esult from this cross: purple flowers or white flowers. Since both
the PP and Pp genotypes would result in the purple flower phenotype, the probabilities of each phenotype are 
purple flowers and  white flowers.
Consider another example. Two pea plants that are heterozygous for plant height are crossed. In pea plants, tall is
dominant to short. The results of the cross are shown in Figure 13.2.

There are three possible genotypes that could result from this cross: TT, Tt, or tt. The probabilities of each are 
, 
, and 
.
There are two possible phenotypes that could result from this cross: tall plants or short plants. Since both the TT
and Tt genotypes would result in the tall phenotype, the probabilities of each phenotype are  tall plants and  short
plants.
For the AP Biology exam, it is not necessary to memorize which specific traits are dominant or recessive. Information about which traits are dominant
