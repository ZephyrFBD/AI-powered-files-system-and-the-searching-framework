on the top of Mt. Wilson in southern California
and the stationary mirror on Mt. Baldy (Mt. San Antonio) 35 km away. He later
measured the speed of light in vacuum using a long evacuated tube.
Today the speed of light, c, in vacuum is taken as
and is defined to be this value. This means that the standard for length, the meter,
is no longer defined separately. Instead, as we noted in Section 1–5, the meter is
now formally defined as the distance light travels in vacuum in 1 299,792,458 of
a second.
We usually round off c to
when extremely precise results are not required. In air, the speed is only slightly
less.
22–5 Energy in EM Waves
Electromagnetic waves carry energy from one region of space to another. This
energy is associated with the moving electric and magnetic fields. In Section 17–9,
we saw that the energy density 
stored in an electric field E is
(Eq. 17–11). The energy density stored in a magnetic field B, as we discussed in
Section 21–11, is given by 
(Eq. 21–10). Thus, the
