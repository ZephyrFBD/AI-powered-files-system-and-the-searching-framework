13. (II) A proposed space station consists of a circular tube that
will rotate about its center
(like a tubular bicycle tire),
Fig. 5–39. The circle formed by
the tube has a diameter of
1.1 km. What must be the rota-
tion speed (revolutions per day)
if an effect nearly equal to
gravity at the surface of the
Earth (say, 0.90 g) is to be felt?

17. (II) Two blocks, with masses 
and 
are connected 
to each other and to a central post by thin rods as 
shown in Fig. 5–41. The blocks revolve about the post at the
same frequency f (revolutions per second) on a frictionless
horizontal surface at distances 
and 
from the post.
Derive an algebraic expression for the tension in each 
rod.
