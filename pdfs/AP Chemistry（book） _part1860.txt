 that lie directly over the spheres in the first 
layer. This is done on the left-hand side of Figure 12.13, as shown by the dashed red lines 
in the side view. Continuing with this pattern, the fourth layer would lie directly over the 
spheres in the second layer, leading to the ABAB stacking pattern seen on the left, which 
is called hexagonal close packing (hcp). Alternatively, the third-layer spheres could 
lie directly over the depressions that were marked with red dots in the first layer. In this 
arrangement, the spheres in the third layer do not sit directly above the spheres in either 
of the first two layers, as shown by the dashed red lines on the lower right-hand side of 
Figure 12.13. If this sequence is repeated in subsequent layers, we derive an ABCABC stack-
ing pattern shown on the right known as cubic close packing (ccp). In both hexagonal 
close packing and cubic close packing, each sphere has 12 equidistant nearest neighbors: 
six neighbors in the same layer, three
