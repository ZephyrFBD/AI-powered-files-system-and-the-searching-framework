cial selection 
investigation using Wisconsin Fast Plants (Brassica). Just as Darwin relied on examples 
of artificial selection in cattle, domestic pigeons, and other farm animals to make his case 
in On the Origin of Species, students can gain important insights into natural selection 
by studying artificial selection. In addition, this particular investigation on artificial 
selection provides an easy transition into student-generated explorations that look for 
possible advantages or disadvantages that selected traits might confer on individuals in 
different environmental conditions.
For the first part of the investigation, students will perform one round of artificial 
selection on a population of Wisconsin Fast Plants. First, they will identify and quantify 
several traits that vary in the population and that they can quantify easily. They then will 
perform artificial selection by cross-pollinating only selected plants. Students will collect 
the seeds, plant them, and then sam
