be water (the solvent) or it may be the substance
dissolved in the water (the solute).
3. Movement of substances may occur from higher to lower concentrations (down or with the concentration
gradient) or the reverse (up or against the gradient).
4. Solute concentrations between two areas may be compared. A solute may be hypertonic (a higher concentration
of solutes), hypotonic (a lower concentration of solutes), or isotonic (an equal concentration of solutes ) relative to
another region.
5. The movement of substances may be passive or active. Active movement requires the expenditure of energy and
usually occurs up a gradient.
Bulk flow is the collective movement of substances (solvent and solutes) in the same direction in response to a force
or pressure. Blood moving through a blood vessel is an example of bulk flow.
Passive transport processes describe the movement of substances from regions of higher concentrations to regions
of lower concentrations (down a concentration gradient) an
