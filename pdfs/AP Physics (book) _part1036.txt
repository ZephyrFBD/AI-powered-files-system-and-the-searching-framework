Hydraulic brakes
Figure 10–6b illustrates the brake system of a car. When the driver presses
the brake pedal, the pressure in the master cylinder increases. This pressure
increase occurs throughout the brake fluid, thus pushing the brake pads against
the disk attached to the car’s wheel.
10–6 Measurement of Pressure;
Gauges and the Barometer
Many devices have been invented to measure pressure, some of which are shown
in Fig. 10–7. The simplest is the open-tube manometer (Fig. 10–7a) which is a
tube partially filled with a liquid, usually mercury or water. The pres-
sure P being measured is related (by Eq. 10–3b) to the difference in height 
of the two levels of the liquid by the relation
[manometer] (10;3c)
where 
is atmospheric pressure (acting on the top of the liquid in the left-hand
tube), and is the density of the liquid. Note that the quantity 
is the
