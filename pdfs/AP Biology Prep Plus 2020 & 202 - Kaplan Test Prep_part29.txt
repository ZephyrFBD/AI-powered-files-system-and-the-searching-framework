orse, pulling an all-nighter will simply deplete your stamina ahead of
the exam. If you feel you must review some AP material, only do so for a
little while and stick to broad review (such as the Essential Content
sections of this book). The best, most eﬀective way to prepare for the AP
Exam at this point is to rest the night beforehand.  
Get together an “AP Exam Kit” containing the following items:
A few No. 2 pencils (Pencils with slightly dull points fill the ovals better;
mechanical pencils are NOT permitted.)
A few pens with black or dark blue ink (for the free-response
questions)
Erasers
A watch (as long as it doesn’t have Internet access, have an alarm, or
make noise)
Your 6-digit school code (Home-schooled students will be provided
with their state’s or country’s home-school code at the time of the
exam.)
Photo ID card
Your AP Student Pack
Make sure that you don’t bring anything that is not allowed in the exam
room. You can find a complete list at the College Board’s website
