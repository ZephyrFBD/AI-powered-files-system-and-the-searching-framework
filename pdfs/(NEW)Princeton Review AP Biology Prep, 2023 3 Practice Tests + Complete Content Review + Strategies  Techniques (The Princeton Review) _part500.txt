multicellular things. In addition, a multicellular thing like a plant or an animal has to coordinate its cells to work together.
Individual cells must have homeostasis, but the overall living thing must have it too. With more complex systems comes

Perhaps it binds directly to the promoter region of gene A and assists RNA polymerase to bind. It might also
