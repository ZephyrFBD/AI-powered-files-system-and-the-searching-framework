erosion of the landscape ensued. Coyotes also flourished, and as a result, populations of smaller
mammals diminished. When wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park, elk, deer, and coyote
populations declined, and much vegetation returned. Numbers of beavers, hares, and other small herbivores
increased, camouflaged by the restored vegetation (especially near lakes and streams). These small herbivores, as
well as the carcasses abandoned by wolves, attracted eagles, wolverines, and other meat-eating animals.
Consequently, the return of wolves to Yellowstone restored the balance of living things that were historically native
to the ecosystem.

competitor or because its natural predators or pathogens are absent. Most invasive species have been accidently or
deliberately introduced by humans.
