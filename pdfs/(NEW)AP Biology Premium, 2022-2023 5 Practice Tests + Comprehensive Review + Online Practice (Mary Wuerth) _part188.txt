actions). The light-independent reactions use this ATP and NADPH, along with
carbon dioxide, to produce sugars. The light-independent reactions then send ADP, Pi, and NADP+ back to the light-
dependent reactions so that photosynthesis can continue. In this way, the two parts of photosynthesis are
interdependent.
Figure 8.1 Light-Dependent Reactions and Light-Independent Reactions (The Calvin Cycle)
In plants, photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have an outer membrane, which is filled with a
liquid called stroma. Floating in the stroma are stacks of membranous sacs called grana, and each individual sac is
called a thylakoid. The stroma is the location of the light-independent reactions, and the thylakoid is the site of the
light-dependent reactions.
Some prokaryotes (for example, cyanobacteria) also perform photosynthesis. However, prokaryotes do not
possess membrane-bound organelles, such as the chloroplasts. In photosynthetic prokaryotes, the light-dependent
