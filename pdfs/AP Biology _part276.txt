tes contain the following genes: AB, Ab, aB, and ab. There
would be four different types of gametes. That one crossover results in
twice the variation in the type of gametes possible.

Figure 8.6 One Crossover Between Homologous Chromosomes
By convention, one map unit distance on a chromosome is the distance
within which recombination occurs 1 percent of the time. The rate of
crossover gives no information about the actual distance between genes,
but it tells us the order of the linked genes on the chromosome.
Here is one example. Genes A, B, and D are linked. The crossover or
recombination frequencies for B and D is 5 percent, for B and A is 30
percent, and for D and A is 25 percent. The linkage map that can be
constructed from this data is BDA or ADB. Whether you read it forward or
backward does not matter.

Here is a testcross between a dihybrid and a homozygous recessive for
both traits
