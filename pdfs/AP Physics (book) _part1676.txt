CHAPTER 15
The Laws of Thermodynamics
The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in inter-
nal energy 
of a system is equal to the heat added to the
system, Q, minus the work done by the system, W:
(15;1)
This important law is a statement of the conservation of energy,
and is found to hold for all processes.
An isothermal process is a process carried out at constant
temperature.
In an adiabatic process, no heat is exchanged 
The work W done by a gas at constant pressure P is given by
