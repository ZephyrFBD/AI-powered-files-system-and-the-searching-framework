nalyze We are given an empirical formula and a molecular  
weight of a compound and asked to determine its molecular 
formula.
Plan The subscripts in a compoundâ€™s molecular formula are 
whole-number multiples of the subscripts in its empirical formu-
la. We find the appropriate multiple by using Equation 3.11.
Solve The formula weight of the empirical formula C3H4 is
3112.0 amu2 + 411.0 amu2 = 40.0 amu
Next, we use this value in Equation 3.11 :
Whole@number multiple =
molecular weight
empirical formula weight
= 121
40.0 = 3.03
Only whole-number ratios make physical sense because molecules 
contain whole atoms. The 3.03 in this case could result from a 
small  
experimental error in the molecular weight. We therefore 
multiply each subscript in the empirical formula by 3 to give the 
molecular formula: C9H12.
Check It is reassuring that the subscripts are moderate-size whole 
numbers. Also,  
calculating the percentage composition of C3H4O3 
gives values very close to the original perce
