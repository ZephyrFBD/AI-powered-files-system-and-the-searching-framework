 6.25  (a) Calculate the energy of a photon of electromagnetic 
 
radiation whose frequency is 2.94 * 1014 s - 1. (b) Calculate 
the energy of a photon of radiation whose wavelength is 413 
nm. (c) What wavelength of radiation has photons of energy 
6.06 * 10 - 19 J?
 6.26  (a) A green laser pointer emits light with a wavelength of 
532 nm. What is the frequency of this light? (b) What is 
the energy of one of these photons? (c) The laser pointer 
emits light because electrons in the material are excited (by 
a battery) from their ground state to an upper excited state. 
When the electrons return to the ground state, they lose the 
excess energy in the form of 532-nm photons. What is the 
energy gap between the ground state and excited state in the 
laser material?
 6.27  (a) Calculate and compare the energy of a photon of 
wavelength 3.3 mm with that of wavelength 0.154 nm. 
 
(b) Use Figure 6.4 to identify t
