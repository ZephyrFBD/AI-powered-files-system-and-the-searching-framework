rallel to the axis fall on a thin lens, they will be
focused to a point called the focal point, F. This will not be precisely true for a lens
with spherical surfaces. But it will be very nearly true—that is, parallel rays will be
focused to a tiny region that is nearly a point—if the diameter of the lens is small
compared to the radii of curvature of the two lens surfaces. This criterion is satis-
fied by a thin lens, one that is very thin compared to its diameter, and we consider
only thin lenses here.
23–7 Thin Lenses; Ray Tracing
The most important simple optical device is the thin lens. The development of
optical devices using lenses dates to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
although the earliest record of eyeglasses dates from the late thirteenth century.
Today we find lenses in eyeglasses, cameras, magnifying glasses, telescopes,
binoculars, microscopes, and medical instruments. A thin lens is usually circ-
ular, and its two faces are portions of a sphere. (Cylindrical fa
