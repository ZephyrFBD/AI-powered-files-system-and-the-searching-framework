 Cl- ion. These ions are arranged in a  
lattice in solid sodium chloride, NaCl.

Is it possible to pick out a unique cluster of atoms that can be thought 
of as a sodium chloride molecule?
We can often tell whether a compound is ionic (consisting of ions) or molecular 
(consisting of molecules) from its composition. As a general rule, cations are metal ions 
and anions are nonmetal ions. Consequently,
Ionic compounds are generally combinations of metals and nonmetals, as in NaCl.
The ions in ionic compounds are arranged in three-dimensional structures, as 
Figure 2.20 shows for NaCl. Because there is no discrete “molecule” of NaCl, we are 
able to write only an empirical formula for this substance. This is true for most other 
ionic compounds.
We can write the empirical formula for an ionic compound if we know the charges 
of the ions. Because chemical compounds are always electrically neutral, the ions in an 
ionic compound always occur in such a ratio that the total positi
