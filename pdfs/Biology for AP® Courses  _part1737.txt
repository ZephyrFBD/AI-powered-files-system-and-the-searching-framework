imarily at the
level of transcription, when DNA is copied into RNA. However, eukaryotes have evolved regulatory mechanisms in gene
expression at multiple levels. In all cases, regulation of gene expression determines the type and amount of protein produced
in the cell. Errors in regulatory processes can result in many human diseases and conditions, including cancer.
Gene expression regulation occurs at different points in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokaryotic organisms express their
entire genome in every cell, but not necessarily all at the same time. In general, a gene is expressed only when its specific
protein product is needed. Remember that each cell in an organism carries the same DNA as every other cell. Yet cells
of eukaryotic organisms each express a unique subset of DNA depending on cell type. To express a protein, DNA is first
transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. In prokaryotic cells, transcription and translation occur almost
simultaneously. In e
