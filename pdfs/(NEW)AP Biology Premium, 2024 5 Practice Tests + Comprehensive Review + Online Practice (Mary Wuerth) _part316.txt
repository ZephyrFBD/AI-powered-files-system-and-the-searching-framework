he father (whose Rh phenotype is unknown) could be either Rr or rr. Choice (A) is incorrect because an RR
father would not be able to pass on an r allele to his offspring. Choices (B) and (C) are incorrect because while
both are possible genotypes for the father, it is not possible to say with certainty which genotype the father has
without knowing the fatherâ€™s phenotype.
Short Free-Response
11. (a) Individual I-2 is heterozygous for sickle cell. This is true because she does not have sickle cell disease (so
she cannot have the ss genotype), but she has a child who has sickle cell disease. So individual I-2 must be a
carrier of the allele (Ss).
(b) Individual III-6 in must be heterozygous. This is true because she does not have sickle cell disease, so she
must have at least one S allele, and since one of her parents (individual II-4) does have sickle cell disease,
she must have inherited a copy of the s allele from that parent.
(c)
(d) Since there is no malaria in San Francisco, the SS
