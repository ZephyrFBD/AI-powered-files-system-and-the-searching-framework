s important infor-
mation about the composition of the equilibrium mixture. For example, consider 
the experimental data for the reaction of carbon monoxide gas and chlorine gas at 
100 °C to form phosgene 1COCl22, a toxic gas used in the manufacture of certain 
polymers and insecticides:
CO1g2 + Cl21g2 ∆ COCl21g2  Kc =
3COCl24
3CO43Cl24 = 4.56 * 109
For the equilibrium constant to be so large, the numerator of the equilibrium- 
constant expression must be approximately a billion 11092 times larger than the 
denominator. Thus, the equilibrium concentration of COCl2 must be much greater 
than that of CO or Cl2, and in fact, this is just what we find experimentally. We 
say that this equilibrium lies to the right (that is, toward the product side). Likewise, 
a very small equilibrium constant indicates that the equilibrium mixture contains 
mostly reactants. We then say that the equilibrium lies to the left. In general,
If K W 1 (large K): Equilibrium lies to right, products predominate
