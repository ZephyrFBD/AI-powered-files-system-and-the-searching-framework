ent that plants use to detect light, allowing them to
regulate flowering based on day length and set up additional daily
rhythms. Thus, (C) is the correct answer. (A) is incorrect because plant
cells do not possess lysosomes; only animal cells do. Instead, plants
use vacuoles to carry out the same function. (B) and (D) are incorrect
because the terms used in each answer choice are switched. Phloem
are thin-walled tubes used to transport sugar and starch from the
leaves and stems of the plant to its roots and xylem are thick-walled
tubes used to carry water from the roots of the plant to its leaves.

Plants have many diﬀerent responses to light. In phototropism, a plant
bends or grows in a certain direction as a response to light. Shoots
usually move towards the light while roots usually move away from it.
In photoperiodism, developmental processes (such as flowering) are
regulated in response to day length. During the initial experiment, the
researcher obse
