NAD+ to NADH can also reduce DPIP if NAD+ and pyruvate are
 
continuously provided. However, only succinate is provided, so only succinate can contribute electrons (normally
for the reduction of FAD to
 
FADH2).
 
28. A. When the stomata are open, water diffuses out of the leaf. At the
 
same time, CO2, required for photosynthesis, diffuses into the leaf. CO2 diffuses into a leaf much slower than H2O
exits because H2O
 
concentration is usually much higher inside the leaf than outside; there
 
is a steep H2O concentration gradient, promoting relatively rapid diffusion of water out of the leaf. In contrast, the
low CO2 concentration
 
in the atmosphere generates a small concentration gradient and a slow
 
diffusion rate for CO2 into the leaf. In addition, a CO2 molecule is larger than H2O and, as a result, diffuses more
slowly.
29. D. The cDNA lacks the introns found in the original DNA segment and contains only the exons necessary for
making mRNA. The number of nucleotides in t
