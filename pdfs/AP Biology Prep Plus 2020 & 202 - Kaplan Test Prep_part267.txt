modifying the rate of photosynthesis. Increasing the light intensity
should increase the rate of photosynthesis and the opening of stomata,
thereby increasing transpiration and water loss. As light levels decrease
in intensity, water loss decreases. Water loss at the leaf surface causes
greater uptake of water through the potometer, which can be measured
as movement of the meniscus through the tube.

CHAPTER:
Plants with vascular tissues usually have three types of
structures: leaves, roots, and branches.
1.
Plants have specialized structures to deal with water and
nutrients. These include stomata controlled by guard cells, a
loosely packed spongy layer, the palisade layer, xylem, and
phloem.
2.
Plants produce energy through photosynthesis and lose water
via transpiration. As water evaporates from the leaves, it pulls
water up through channels in the xylem. The phloem carries
nutrients throughout the plant.
3.
Plants can reproduce as
