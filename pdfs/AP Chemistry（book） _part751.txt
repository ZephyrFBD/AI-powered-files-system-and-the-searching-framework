nergy produced is ultimately used to do 
work in the form of muscle contractions and nerve cell activities. The 
remainder is released as heat, part of which is used to maintain body 
temperature. When the body produces too much heat, as in times of 
heavy physical exertion, it dissipates the excess to the surroundings.
Heat is transferred from the body to its surroundings primarily 
by radiation, convection, and evaporation. Radiation is the direct loss of 
heat from the body to cooler surroundings, much as a hot stovetop 
radiates heat to its surroundings. Convection is heat loss by virtue of 
heating air that is in contact with the body. The heated air rises and 
is replaced with cooler air, and the process continues. Warm clothing 
decreases convective heat loss in cold weather. Evaporative cooling 
occurs when perspiration is generated at the skin surface by the sweat 
glands (Figure 5.20). Heat is removed from the body as the perspira-
tion evaporates. Perspiration is predominant
