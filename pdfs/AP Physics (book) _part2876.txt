ose that you wish to construct a telescope that can
resolve features 6.5 km across on the Moon, 384,000 km
away. You have a 2.0-m-focal-length objective lens whose
diameter is 11.0 cm. What focal-length eyepiece is needed
if your eye can resolve objects 0.10 mm apart at a distance
of 25 cm? What is the resolution limit set by the size of the
objective lens (that is, by diffraction)? Use
*25–11 X-Ray Diffraction
*60. (II) X-rays of wavelength 0.138 nm fall on a crystal whose
atoms, lying in planes, are spaced 0.285 nm apart. At what
angle 
(relative to the surface, Fig.25–38) must the X-rays be
directed if the first diffraction maximum is to be observed?
