ower if loaded with 300 kg rather than 200 kg?
APPROACH We use Hooke’s law: the weight of the people, mg, causes a 3.0-cm
displacement.
SOLUTION (a) The added force of
causes the
springs to compress
Therefore (Eq. 11–1), the spring constant is
(b) If the car is loaded with 300 kg, Hooke’s law gives
or 4.5 cm.
NOTE In (b), we could have obtained x without solving for k: since x is propor-
tional to F, if 200 kg compresses the spring 3.0 cm, then 1.5 times the force will
compress the spring 1.5 times as much, or 4.5 cm.
x = F
k
=
(300 kg)A9.8 ms2B
A6.5 * 104 NmB
= 4.5 * 10–2 m,
k = F
x
=
1960 N
3.0 * 10–2 m = 6.5 * 104 Nm.
3.0 * 10–2 m.
(200 kg)A9.8 ms2B = 1960 N

†The word “harmonic” refers to the motion being sinusoidal, which we discuss in Section 11–3. It is
“simple” when the motion is sinusoidal of a single frequency. This can happen only if friction or other
forces are not acting.
