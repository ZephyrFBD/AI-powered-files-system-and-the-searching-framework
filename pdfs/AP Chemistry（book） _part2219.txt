ed knowing the other three. Equation 14.14 also has the form of a 
straight line 1y = mx + b2. If the reaction is second order, a plot of 1>3A4t versus t yields 
a straight line with slope k and y-intercept 1>3A40. One way to distinguish between first- 
and second-order rate laws is to graph both  ln3A4t and 1>3A4t against t. If the  ln3A4t plot 
is linear, the reaction is first order; if the 1>3A4t plot is linear, the reaction is second order.

The following data were obtained for the gas-phase decomposition  
of nitrogen dioxide at 300 °C, NO21g2 ¡ NO1g2 + 1

To graph ln3NO24 and 1>3NO24 
against time, we first make the fol-
