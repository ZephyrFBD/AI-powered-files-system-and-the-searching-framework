yotic and eukaryotic. For example,
both animal and plant cells are classified as eukaryotic cells, whereas bacterial cells are classified as prokaryotic. Before
discussing the criteria for determining whether a cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic, let’s first examine how biologists study
cells.
Microscopy
Cells vary in size. With few exceptions, individual cells cannot be seen with the naked eye, so scientists use microscopes
(micro- = “small”; -scope = “to look at”) to study them. A microscope is an instrument that magnifies an object. Most
photographs of cells are taken with a microscope, and these images can also be called micrographs.
The optics of a compound microscope’s lenses change the orientation of the image that the user sees. A specimen that
is right-side up and facing right on the microscope slide will appear upside-down and facing left when viewed through a
microscope, and vice versa. Similarly, if the slide is moved left while looking through the microscope, it will appear
