Some hereditary and age-related diseases are caused by translation errors. Explain why an error in translation may
cause disease.
a.
If there is an error in translation, the correct lipids will not be made for signaling, storage of energy or to
perform vital functions. This can cause hereditary and age-related diseases.
b.
Translation is the process in which a particular segment of DNA is copied into RNA (mRNA) by the enzyme
RNA polymerase. Error in such copying can lead to various hereditary and age-related diseases.
c.
Translation is the process used by ribosomes to synthesize proteins from amino acids. If there is an error in
this process, the correct proteins will not be made to build important body tissue or perform vital functions
