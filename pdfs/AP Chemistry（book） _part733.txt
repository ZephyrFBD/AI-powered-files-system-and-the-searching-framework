s can exist together in a volume in-
deﬁnitely without noticeable reaction occurring. Once the reaction is 
initiated, however, energy is rapidly transferred from the system (the 
reactants) to the surroundings as heat. The system thus loses enthalpy 
by transferring the heat to the surroundings. (Recall that the ﬁrst law 
of thermodynamics tells us that the total energy of the system plus 
the surroundings does not change; energy is conserved.)
Enthalpy change is not the only consideration in the spon-
taneity of reactions, nor is it a foolproof guide. For example, even 
though ice melting is an endothermic process,
H2O1s2 ¡  H2O1l2    ∆H = +6.01 kJ
this process is spontaneous at temperatures above the freezing point 
of water 10 °C2. The reverse process, water freezing, is spontaneous at

Heat Capacity and specific Heat
The more heat an object gains, the hotter it gets. All substances change temperature 
when they are heated, but the magnitude of the
