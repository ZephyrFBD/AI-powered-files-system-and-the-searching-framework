common ancestor. Although it may seem that living things today stay much the same, this
is not the case. Evolution is actually an ongoing process. Additionally, new species are discovered regularly. For example,
scientists have used a method called fluorescent in situ hybridization, which uses fluorescent probes to locate specific genes
on chromosomes, to discover a green sea slug that can perform photosynthesis just like a plant.
[1] The slug obtains genes
related to photosynthesis from the algae it eats through a process called horizontal gene transfer. In this process, genes can
be transferred directly from one cell to another. The algal genes code for products that repair and maintain chloroplasts eaten
by the slug. You can read more about it at this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32slug) .
