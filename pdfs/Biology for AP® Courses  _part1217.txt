ologous chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes are matched pairs containing the
same genes in identical locations along their length. Diploid organisms inherit one copy of each homologous chromosome
from each parent; all together, they are considered a full set of chromosomes. Haploid cells, containing a single copy of
each homologous chromosome, are found only within an organism’’s reproductive structures, such as the ovaries and testes.
Haploid cells can be either gametes or spores. Male gametes are sperm and female gametes are eggs. All animals and most
plants produce gametes. Spores are haploid cells that can produce a haploid organism or can fuse with another spore to form
a diploid cell. Some plants and all fungi produce spores.
As you have learned, the nuclear division that forms haploid cells— meiosis—is closely related to mitosis. Mitosis is the
part of a cell reproduction cycle that results in identical daughter nuclei that are also genetically identical to the original
parent n
