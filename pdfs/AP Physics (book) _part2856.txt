e defect of a nearsighted eye, which cannot focus well on dis-
tant objects. Converging lenses are used to correct for defects
in which the eye cannot focus on close objects.
A simple magnifier is a converging lens that forms a virtual
image of an object placed at (or within) the focal point. The
angular magnification, when viewed by a relaxed normal eye, is
(25–2a)
where f is the focal length of the lens and N is the near point of
the eye (25 cm for a “normal” eye).
An astronomical telescope consists of an objective lens or
mirror, and an eyepiece that magnifies the real image formed
by the objective. The magnification is equal to the ratio of the
objective and eyepiece focal lengths, and the image is inverted:

A compound microscope also uses objective and eyepiece
lenses, and the final image is inverted. The total magnification
is the product of the magnifications of the two lenses and is
