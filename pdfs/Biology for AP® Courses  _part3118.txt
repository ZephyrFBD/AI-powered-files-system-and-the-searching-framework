Unfortunately, there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease. Current treatments focus on managing the symptoms of the disease.
Because decrease in the activity of cholinergic neurons (neurons that use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine) is common in

inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. Other clinical interventions focus on behavioral
therapies like psychotherapy, sensory therapy, and cognitive exercises. Since Alzheimer’s disease appears to hijack the
normal aging process, research into prevention is prevalent. Smoking, obesity, and cardiovasc
