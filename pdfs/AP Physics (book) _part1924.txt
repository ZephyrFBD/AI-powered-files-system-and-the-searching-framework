28. (II) Many chemical reactions release energy. Suppose that
at the beginning of a reaction, an electron and proton are
separated by 0.110 nm, and their final separation is 0.100 nm.
How much electric potential energy was lost in this reaction
(in units of eV)?
29. (III) How much voltage must be used to accelerate a proton
(radius 
) so that it has sufficient energy to just
“touch” a silicon nucleus? A silicon nucleus has a charge of
and its radius is about 
Assume the
potential is that for point charges.
