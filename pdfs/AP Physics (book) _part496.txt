hat is, not a point), we must consider how to measure the distance r.
A correct calculation treats each extended body as a collection of particles, and 
the total force is the sum of the forces due to all the particles. The sum over all these
particles is often done using integral calculus, which Newton himself invented.
When extended bodies are small compared to the distance between them (as for the
Earth–Sun system), little inaccuracy results from considering them as point particles.
Newton was able to show that the gravitational force exerted on a particle outside a
uniform sphere is the same as if the entire mass of the sphere was concentrated at its
center.† Thus Eq. 5–4 gives the correct force between two uniform spheres where r
is the distance between their centers.]
