of cytoskeletal elements. Several types of fibrous proteins are found
in the intermediate filaments. You are probably most familiar with keratin, the fibrous protein that strengthens your hair,
nails, and the epidermis of the skin.
Microtubules
As their name implies, microtubules are small hollow tubes. The walls of the microtubule are made of polymerized dimers
of α-tubulin and β-tubulin, two globular proteins (Figure 4.25). With a diameter of about 25 nm, microtubules are the
widest components of the cytoskeleton. They help the cell resist compression, provide a track along which vesicles move
through the cell, and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell. Like microfilaments, microtubules
can disassemble and reform quickly.

Figure 4.25 Microtubules are hollow. Their walls consist of 13 polymerized dimers of α-tubulin and β-tubulin (right
