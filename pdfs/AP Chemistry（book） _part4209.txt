9.9 The C    ¬ O   ¬ H 
bond involving the right O because of the greater repulsions due 
to the nonbonding electron domains. The angle should be less 
than the ideal value of 109.5°. Figure 9.10 Zero. Because they 
are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, the vectors cancel 
upon addition. Figure 9.13 0.74 Å is the bond length, 436 kJ/
mol is the bond strength. Figure 9.16  120˚ Figure 9.17 The 
pz orbital. Figure 9.18 No. All four hybrids are equivalent and 
the angles between them are all the same, so we can use any of the 
two to hold the nonbonding pairs. Figure 9.19 Because the P 3p 
orbitals are larger than the N 2p orbitals, we would expect somewhat 
larger lobes on the hybrid orbitals in the right-most drawing. Other 
than that, the molecules are entirely analogous. Figure 9.22  
They have to lie in the same plane in order to allow the overlap of 
the p orbitals to be effective in forming the p bond. Figure 9.23  
Acetylene should have the higher carbon-carbon bond energy
