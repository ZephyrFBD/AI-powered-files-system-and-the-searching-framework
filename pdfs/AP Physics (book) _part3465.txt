ells. One particu-
larly dangerous radioactive isotope is 
which is chemically much like calcium
and becomes concentrated in bone, where it causes bone cancer and destroys bone
marrow. The 1963 treaty signed by over 100 nations that bans nuclear weapons
testing in the atmosphere was motivated because of the hazards of fallout.

1–3 Nuclear Fusion
The mass of every stable nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of its consti-
tuent protons and neutrons. For example, the mass of the helium isotope 
is less than the mass of two protons plus two neutrons, Example 30–3. If two
protons and two neutrons were to come together to form a helium nucleus, there
would be a loss of mass. This mass loss is manifested in the release of energy.
Nuclear Fusion; Stars
The process of building up nuclei by bringing together individual protons and
neutrons, or building larger nuclei by combining small nuclei, is called nuclear fusion.
In Fig. 31–12 (same as Fig. 30–1), we can see why small nuclei can co
