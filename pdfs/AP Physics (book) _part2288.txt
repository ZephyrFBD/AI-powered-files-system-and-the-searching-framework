perpendicular to the plane of the circuit. If the bar has a
length
a mass of 1.5 g, and is placed in a field of
1.7 T, what constant current flow is needed to accelerate
the bar from rest to 
in a distance of 1.0 m? In what
direction must the magnetic field point?

85. A particle with charge q and momentum p, initially moving
along the x axis, enters a region where a uniform magnetic
field 
extends over a
width
as shown in
Fig. 20–70. The particle
is deflected a distance d
in the 
direction as it
traverses the field. Deter-
mine (a) whether q is
positive or negative, and
(b) the magnitude of its
momentum p in terms of
and d.
