ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-4.B.3
Relationships among interacting populations 
can be characterized by positive and negative 
effects and can be modeled. Examples include 
predator/prey interactions, trophic cascades, 
and niche partitioning.
ENE-4.B.4
Competition, predation, and symbioses, 
including parasitism, mutualism, and 
commensalism, can drive population dynamics.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-4.B
Explain how interactions 
within and among 
populations influence 
community structure.
ENE-4.C
Explain how community 
structure is related to 
energy availability in 
the environment.
ENE-4.C.1
Cooperation or coordination between 
organisms, populations, and species can result 
in enhanced movement of, or access to, matter
