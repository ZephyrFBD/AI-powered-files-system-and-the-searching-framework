arance of free
electrons and the birth of atoms, the photons—which had been continually
scattering from the free electrons—now became free to spread throughout the
universe. As mentioned in the previous Section, we say that the photons became
decoupled from matter. Thus decoupling occurred at recombination. The energy
contained in radiation had been decreasing (lengthening in wavelength as the
universe expanded); and at about 
(even before decoupling) the
energy contained in matter became dominant over radiation. The universe was
said to have become matter-dominated (marked on Fig. 33–29). As the universe
continued to expand, the electromagnetic radiation cooled further, to 2.7 K today,
forming the cosmic microwave background radiation we detect from everywhere
in the universe.
After the birth of atoms, then stars and galaxies could begin to form: by self-
gravitation around mass concentrations (inhomogeneities). Stars began to form
about 200 million years after the Big Bang, galaxies
