involved in water dimer formation? (c) The Kp for water 
dimer formation in the gas phase is 0.050 at 300 K and 
0.020 at 350 K. Is water dimer formation endothermic or 
exothermic?
 15.102 The protein hemoglobin (Hb) transports O2 in mamma-
lian blood. Each Hb can bind 4 O2 molecules. The equi-
librium constant for the O2 binding reaction is higher in 
fetal hemoglobin than in adult hemoglobin. In discuss-
ing protein oxygen-binding capacity, biochemists use a 
measure called the P50 value, defined as the partial pres-
sure of oxygen at which 50% of the protein is saturated. 
Fetal hemoglobin has a P50 value of 19 torr, and adult 
hemoglobin has a P50 value of 26.8 torr. Use these data to 
estimate how much larger Kc is for the aqueous reaction 
4 O21g2 + Hb1aq2 âˆ†3Hb1O2241aq24 in a fetus, com-
pared to Kc for the same reaction in an adult.
