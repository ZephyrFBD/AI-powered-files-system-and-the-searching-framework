rishment from the mother through the placenta. The fetus of a marsupial leaves the
motherâ€™s uterus at an early stage of development and completes the remaining development while attached to a teat
in the abdominal pouch. The great similarity of the rabbit and the wallaby is the result of natural selection.
3. Embryology reveals similar stages in development (ontogeny) among related species. The similarities help
establish evolutionary relationships (phylogeny).
Gill slits and tails are found in fish, chicken, pig, and human embryos.
4. Comparative anatomy describes two kinds of structures that contribute to the identification of evolutionary
relationships among species.
Homologous structures (homologies) are body parts that resemble one another in different species because they
have evolved from a common ancestor. Because anatomy may be modified for survival in specific environments,
homologous structures may look different, but will resemble one another in pattern (how they are put to
