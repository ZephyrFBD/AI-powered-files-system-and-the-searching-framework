93. Storage facilities for fruits and vegetables are usually
refrigerated and well ventilated. Why are these conditions
advantageous?
a.
Refrigeration slows chemical reactions,
including fruit ripening. Ventilation adds the
ethylene gas that speeds up fruit maturation.
b.
Refrigeration slows chemical reactions,
including fruit maturation. Ventilation removes
the ethylene gas that reduces fruit ripening.
c.
Refrigeration slows chemical reactions,
including fruit maturation. Ventilation removes
the ethylene gas that speeds up fruit ripening.
d.
Refrigeration removes the ethylene gas that
speeds up fruit ripening. Ventilation slows
chemical reactions, including fruit maturation.
