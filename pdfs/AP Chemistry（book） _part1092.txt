Chemistry Put to Work Ionic Size and Lithium-Ion Batteries
Notice the positions and atomic numbers of these elements in the periodic table. The 
nonmetal anions precede the noble gas Ne in the table. The metal cations follow Ne. Oxygen, 
the largest ion in this isoelectronic series, has the lowest atomic number, 8. Aluminum, the 
smallest of these ions, has the highest atomic number, 13.
Arrange the ions K+, Cl-, Ca2+, and S2 - in order of decreasing size.
Sample Exercise 7.4 
Ionic Radii in an Isoelectronic Series
SOLUTION
This is an isoelectronic series, with all ions having 18 elec-
trons. In such a series, size decreases as nuclear charge (atomic 
number) increases. The atomic numbers of the ions are S 16, 
Cl 17, K 19, Ca 20. Thus, the ions decrease in size in the order 
S2 - 7 Cl- 7 K+ 7 Ca2+.

(b) Br- 6 Sr2 + 6 Se2 - 6 Te2 - 6 Rb+
(c) Rb+ 6 Sr2+ 6 Se2 - 6 Te2 - 6 Br-
(d) Rb+ 6 Br- 6 Sr2+ 6 Se2 - 6 Te2 -
(e) Sr2 + 6 Rb+ 6 Br
