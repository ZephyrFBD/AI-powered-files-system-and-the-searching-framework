do the cations and anions migrate through the solution? 
Assume the Al is not coated with its oxide.
Cell Potentials under Standard Conditions 
(Section 20.4)
 20.31  (a) What is the definition of the volt? (b) Do all voltaic cells 
produce a positive cell potential?
 20.32  (a) Which electrode of a voltaic cell, the cathode or the 
anode, corresponds to the higher potential energy for the 
electrons? (b) What are the units for electrical potential? 
How does this unit relate to energy expressed in joules?
 20.33  (a) Write the half-reaction that occurs at a hydrogen elec-
trode in acidic aqueous solution when it serves as the cath-
ode of a voltaic cell. (b) Write the half-reaction that occurs 
at a hydrogen electrode in acidic aqueous solution when 
it serves as the anode of a voltaic cell. (c) What is standard 
about the standard hydrogen electrode?
 20.34  (a) What conditions must be met for a reduction potential 
to be a standard reduction pote
