 that is, they produce no progeny of their own. Bees are an example of
haplodiploidy, a reproductive system in which queens and female workers are diploid and male bees (drones) are
haploid. In the spring, males are born from unfertilized eggs. One male mates with the queen who, in turn, stores the
sperm to fertilize her eggs throughout the year. Following mating, the males are driven from the hive and die. In a
normal diploid reproductive system, mother and offspring, as well as sisters, are related, on average, by only 50% of
their genes. However, because half of the chromosomes of all sister bees are the same (from their haploid father),
they share, on average, 75% of their genes. Thus, the inclusive fitness of a worker bee (in terms of the number of
genes it contributes to the next generation) is greater if it promotes the production of sisters (by nurturing the queen)
than if it were to produce offspring itself. Thus, kin selection favors sterile workers in a haplodiploid society.
