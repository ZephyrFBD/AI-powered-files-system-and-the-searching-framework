 deoxyribose. Hence, the name deoxyribonucleic acid. Notice
that the sugar is linked to two things: a phosphate and a nitrogenous base. A nucleotide can have one of four
different nitrogenous bases:
adenine—a purine (double-ringed nitrogenous base)
guanine—a purine (double-ringed nitrogenous base)
cytosine—a pyrimidine (single-ringed nitrogenous base)
thymine—a pyrimidine (single-ringed nitrogenous base)
Any of these four bases can attach to the sugar. As we’ll soon see, this is extremely important when it comes to the
message of the genetic code in DNA. Prokaryotes and eukaryotes can also contain plasmids, which are small
double-stranded, circular DNA molecules.
The nucleotides can link up in a long chain to form a single strand of DNA. Here’s a small section of a DNA strand.
The nucleotides themselves are linked together by phosphodiester bonds between the sugars and the phosphates.
This is called the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA and it serves as a scaffold for the bases.
