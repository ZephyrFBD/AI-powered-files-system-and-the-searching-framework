. For example, 950 offspring might be recovered that were
either AaBb or aabb, but 50 offspring would also be obtained that were either Aabb or aaBb. These results suggested that
linkage occurred most often, but a significant minority of offspring were the products of recombination.

Figure 13.3 Inheritance patterns of unlinked and linked genes are shown. In (a), two genes are located on
different chromosomes so independent assortment occurs during meiosis. The offspring have an equal chance
of being the parental type (inheriting the same combination of traits as the parents) or a nonparental type
(inheriting a different combination of traits than the parents). In (b), two genes are very close together on the
same chromosome so that no crossing over occurs between them. The genes are therefore always inherited
together and all of the offspring are the par
