4. In the year 2000, specimens of Caulerpa taxifolia,
a green alga used in tropical aquariums, were
found off the coast of California. Native to the
Indian Ocean, C. taxifolia is known for aggressive
growth and an ability to compete with sea grasses.
It is currently on an international list of invasive
species. Which of the following best predicts the
consequences of the introduction of C. taxifolia to
the California coast?
(A) Without natural herbivores or competitors,
C. taxifolia will grow rapidly and crowd out 
native species of producers. 
(B) C. taxifolia will have a hard time establishing 
itself because it will have to compete 
against native species of sea grasses, which 
are better adapted to the environment. 
(C) C. taxifolia will grow rapidly, leading to an 
increase in the diversity of producers. 
(D) Becaus
