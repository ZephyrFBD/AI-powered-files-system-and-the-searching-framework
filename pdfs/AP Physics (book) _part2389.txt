The magnetic flux passing through a loop is equal to the prod-
uct of the area of the loop times the perpendicular component
of the magnetic field:
(21;1)
If the magnetic flux through a coil of wire changes in time,
an emf is induced in the coil. The magnitude of the induced
emf equals the time rate of change of the magnetic flux through
the loop times the number N of loops in the coil:
(21;2b)
This is Faraday’s law of induction.
The induced emf can produce a current whose magnetic
field opposes the original change in flux (Lenz’s law).
Faraday’s law also tells us that a changing magnetic field
produces an electric field; and that a straight wire of length 
moving with speed 
perpendicular to a magnetic field of
strength B has an emf induced between its ends equal to

An electric generator changes mechanical energy into
electric energy. Its operation is based on Faraday’
