C, and the dehumidifier does work at
the rate of 600 W of electrical power. (See Sections 15–6,
13–12, and 14–5.)
*8. Trees offsetting CO2. Trees can help offset the buildup of
CO2 due to burning coal and other fossil fuels. CO2 can be
absorbed by tree foliage. Trees use the carbon to grow,
and release O2 into the atmosphere. Suppose a refrigerator
uses 600 kWh of electricity per year (about 2
109 J) from
a 33% efficient coal-fired power plant. Burning 1 kg of coal
releases about 2
107 J of energy. Assume coal is all
carbon, which when burned in air becomes CO2. (a) How
much coal is burned per year to run this refrigerator?
(b) Assuming a forest can capture 1700 kg of carbon per
hectare (
10,000 m2) per year, estimate how many square
meters of forest are needed to capture the carbon (in the
form now of CO2) emitted in (a).
