 the questions of the evolution of meiosis and the evolution of sex, because early
meiosis may have been advantageous for different reasons than it is now. Thinking outside the box and
imagining what the early benefits from meiosis might have been is one approach to uncovering how it may
have evolved.
Meiosis and mitosis share obvious cellular processes and it makes sense that meiosis evolved from mitosis.
The difficulty lies in the clear differences between meiosis I and mitosis. Adam Wilkins and Robin Holliday[1]
summarized the unique events that needed to occur for the evolution of meiosis from mitosis. These steps
are homologous chromosome pairing, crossover exchanges, sister chromatids remaining attached during
anaphase, and suppression of DNA replication in interphase. They argue that the first step is the hardest
and most important, and that understanding how it evolved would make the evolutionary process clearer.
They suggest genetic experiments that might shed light on the evo
