Its Conservation
If we can ignore friction and other nonconservative forces, or if only conservative
forces do work on a system, we arrive at a particularly simple and beautiful rela-
tion involving energy.
When no nonconservative forces do work, then  
in the general form
of the work-energy principle (Eq. 6–10). Then we have
(6;11a)
or
(6;11b)
We now define a quantity E, called the total mechanical energy of our system, as
the sum of the kinetic and potential energies at any moment:
Now we can rewrite Eq. 6–11b as
(6;12a)
or
(6;12b)
Equations 6–12 express a useful and profound principle regarding the total
mechanical energy of a system—namely, that it is a conserved quantity. The total
mechanical energy E remains constant as long as no nonconservative forces do
work:
at some initial time 1 is equal to the
at any later time 2.
