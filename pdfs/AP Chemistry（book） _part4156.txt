24.39 Yes, this information suggests (but does not prove) that the 
reactions proceed in the same manner. That the two rate laws are ﬁrst 
order in both reactants and second order overall indicates that the 
activated complex in the rate-determining step in each mechanism is 
bimolecular and contains one molecule of each reactant. This is usu-
ally an indication that the mechanisms are the same, but it does not 
rule out the possibility of different fast steps or a different order of ele-
mentary steps. 24.41 ∆Hcomb>mol CH2 for cyclopropane = 696.3 kJ, 
for cyclopentane = 663.4 kJ. ∆Hcomb>CH2 group for cyclopropane 
is greater because C3H6 contains a strained ring. When combus-
tion occurs, the strain is relieved and the stored energy is released.
