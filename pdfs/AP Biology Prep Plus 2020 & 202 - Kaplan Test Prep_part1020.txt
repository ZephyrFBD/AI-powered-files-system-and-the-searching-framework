Figure 1.  One gene-one enzyme hypothesis
Researchers performed an experiment to investigate the pathway of
arginine (an essential amino acid). Neurospora mutants, each mutated in a
diﬀerent gene, were grown on minimal medium (sugar, salts, and vitamins)
and minimal medium with an additional supplement. The results are shown
in Table 1. If a mutant is supplied with the compound it is unable to
produce, it will grow.

Explain how genetic mutations aﬀect enzyme synthesis.
(a)
Propose an appropriate control treatment for the experiment, and
describe how the control treatment would increase the validity of the
results.
(b)
Using the data in the table, identify the intermediates of the arginine
pathway on the template provided.
(c)
Provide reasoning for the intermedi
