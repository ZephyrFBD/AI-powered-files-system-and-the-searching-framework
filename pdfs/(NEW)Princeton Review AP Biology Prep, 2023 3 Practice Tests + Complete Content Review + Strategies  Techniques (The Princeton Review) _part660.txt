might be limited in resources that the babies will
need. For instance, as the number of babies increases, it becomes more difficult to protect them from predators, or to
gather enough food. In this data, it looks like the carrying capacity is around 9.
b. This study involved observing birds in their natural habitat. Identify the independent variable in this brood
size vs. percent survival study. Describe what makes an observational study different from a study inside a lab
environment. (3 points)
The independent variable would be the number of offspring in a brood; the scientist would count how many survive
from each brood size. In an observational study, it is difficult to control anything other than the independent variable.
Maybe the nests being studied are in slightly different environments. Maybe the parents of different broods are better
than others. There is a lot that might be different between groups in an observational study. In a lab study, variables
are more easily controll
