er than concen-
tration in this graph. The first half-life occurs at 13,600 s (3.78 h). At a time 
13,600 s later, the methyl isonitrile pressure (and therefore, concentration) 
has decreased to half of one-half, or one-fourth, of the initial value.
 
In a first-order reaction, the concentration of the reactant decreases 
by one-half in each of a series of regularly spaced time intervals, 
each interval equal to t1>2.
