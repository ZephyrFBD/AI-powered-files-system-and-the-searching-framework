k with information from long-extinct organisms. Trying to decipher the proper connections,
especially given the presence of homologies and analogies, makes the task of building an accurate tree of life extraordinarily
difficult. Add to that the advancement of DNA technology, which now provides large quantities of genetic sequences to be
used and analyzed. Taxonomy is a subjective discipline: many organisms have more than one connection to each other, so
each taxonomist will decide the order of connections.
To aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately, scientists often use a concept called maximum
parsimony, which means that events occurred in the simplest, most obvious way. For example, if a group of people entered
a forest preserve to go hiking, based on the principle of maximum parsimony, one could predict that most of the people
would hike on established trails rather than forge new ones.
For scientists deciphering evolutionary pathways, the same idea is used:
