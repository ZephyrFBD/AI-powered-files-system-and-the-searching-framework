 a particular way. Adenine in one strand always binds to thymine (A–T or T–A) in
the other strand. Similarly, guanine always binds to cytosine (G–C or C–G). This predictable matching of the bases
is known as base pairing.
The two strands are said to be complementary. This means that if you know the sequence of bases in one strand,
you’ll know the sequence of bases in the other strand. For example, if the base sequence in one DNA strand is A–T–
C, the base sequence in the complementary strand will be T–A–G.
The two DNA strands run in opposite directions. You’ll notice from the figure above that each DNA strand has a 5’
end and a 3’ end, so-called for the carbon that ends the strand (i.e., the fifth carbon in the sugar ring is at the 5’ end,
while the third carbon is at the 3’ end). The 5’ end has a phosphate group, and the 3’ end has an OH, or “hydroxyl,”
group. The 5’ end of one strand is always opposite to the 3’ end of the other strand. The strands are therefore said to
be antiparall
