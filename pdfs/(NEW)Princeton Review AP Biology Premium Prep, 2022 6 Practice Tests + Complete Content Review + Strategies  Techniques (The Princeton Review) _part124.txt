read each question at least twice. As you read the question, focus
on key words, especially the bolded direction words. Almost every essay question begins with a direction word.
Make sure to read closely: some questions contain more than one direction word and you need to address each of
these in your answer. As you read through those outlines of what each question contains, you will recognize various
direction words. Some examples of direction words are calculate, explain, identify, and predict. These words tell
you exactly what the question is looking for, and they’re exactly what you should do. For instance, a question that
asks you to support a claim expects you to actually provide reasoning and/or evidence that backs it up. By contrast, a
question that asks you to construct, draw, or represent data may just want you to include a graph or build a table, no
further explanation necessary.
Many students lose points because they either misread the question or fail to do what’s asked of
