t 
not the magnitude of the enthalpy change: 
∆H2 = - ∆H1.
 
SOLUTION
Analyze Our goal is to use a thermochemical equation to calculate 
the heat produced when a specific amount of methane gas is 
combusted. According to Equation 5.17, 890 kJ is released by the 
system when 1 mol CH4 is burned at constant pressure.
Sample Exercise 5.4 
Relating 횫H to Quantities of Reactants and Products
How much heat is released when 4.50 g of methane gas is burned in a constant-pressure system? (Use the information given in 
Equation 5.17.)
Plan Equation 5.17 provides us with a stoichiometric conversion 
factor: (1 mol CH4 ] -890 kJ). Thus, we can convert moles of CH4 
to kJ of energy. First, however, we must convert grams of CH4 to 
moles of CH4.
Solve 
The conversion sequence is:
By adding the atomic weights 
of C and 4 H, we have 
1 mol CH4 = 16.0 CH4. We can use 
the appropriate conversion factors 
to convert grams of CH4 to moles of 
CH4 to kilojoules:
Heat = 14.50 g CH42a
1 mol CH4
16.0 g CH4
