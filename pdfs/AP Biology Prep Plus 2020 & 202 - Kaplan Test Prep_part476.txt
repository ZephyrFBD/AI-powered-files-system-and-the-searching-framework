ir rapidly changing environment
(A)
Sexual spore production, because it increases the likelihood
of variations that may help the fungi adapt to the changing
environment
(B)
Fragmentation, because it does not require the exertion of a
large amount of energy, making it the best option during this
stressful situation
(C)
Asexual spore production, because there is no need to waste
time finding a compatible mate
(D)
10. A student prepares two samples of fungi in culture. She then adds
lectin, a protein that binds to certain carbohydrates, to one of the
samples, leaving the other one untreated as a control. This
specific lectin is known to induce mitosis by binding to a
membrane-bound antigen on the cell surface. This causes an
intracellular signal cascade that causes calcium release from the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and, ultimately, cell replication.
AÈ‡er the samples are stored for two days, the number of cells
from each group in interphase and mitosis are observed and
shown in the table
