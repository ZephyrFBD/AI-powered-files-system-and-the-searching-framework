 5.80 Methanol 1CH3OH2 is used as a fuel in race cars. (a) Write a 
balanced equation for the combustion of liquid methanol in 
air. (b) Calculate the standard enthalpy change for the reac-
tion, assuming H2O1g2 as a product. (c) Calculate the heat 
produced by combustion per liter of methanol. Methanol 
has a density of 0.791 g>mL. (d) Calculate the mass of CO2 
produced per kJ of heat emitted.

2 H1g2 ¡ H21g2
 
 (c)  
Na1g2 ¡ Na +1g2 + e-
 
 (d)  
I21s2 ¡ I21l2
 5.82 Without doing any calculations, predict the sign of ∆H for 
each of the following reactions:
 
 (a)  
2 NO21g2 ¡ N2O41g2
 
 (b)  
2 F1g2 ¡ F21g2
 
 (c)
