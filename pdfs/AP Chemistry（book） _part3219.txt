e value of ∆G° is half that in part (a) 
because the coefficients in the chemical 
equation are half those in (a).

For any spontaneous process, ∆G is a measure of the maximum use-
ful work, wmax, that can be extracted from the process: ∆G = wmax.  
(Section 19.5) Because ∆G = -nFE, the maximum useful electri-
cal work obtainable from a voltaic cell is
            wmax = -nFEcell 
 
[20.14]
Because cell emf, Ecell, is always positive for a voltaic cell, wmax is neg-
ative, indicating that work is done by a system on its surroundings, as 
we expect for a voltaic cell. 
 (Section 5.2)
As Equation 20.14 shows, the more charge a voltaic cell moves 
through a circuit (that is, the larger nF is) and the larger the emf 
pushing the electrons through the circuit (that is, the larger E°
cell is), 
the more work the cell can accomplish. In Sample Exercise 20.10, 
we calculated ∆G° = -170 kJ>mol for the reaction 4 Ag1s2 +
O21g2 + 4 H+
