and
fat. Carbohydrates ultimately break down or are transformed into
glucose. The amino acids from proteins ultimately enter the citric acid
cycle as pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. Fats are broken down into glycerols
that can be converted to pyruvate and fatty acids that are converted to
acetyl-CoA. All of the pyruvate and acetyl-CoA from the breakdown of
food enter the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain.
Feedback Mechanisms
Input is vital for success on both the organismal and cellular level.
Imagine you are playing a video game and you keep losing. All you know
is that the video game suddenly says “game over,” but you never know
why. You have no information on why you lost your game and, therefore,
you have no idea how to prevent it from happening again. Biological
systems are the same. They require input from the surrounding
environment, whether it be from within the body or the external
environment, to understand what processes need to be adapted in order
to survive. This
