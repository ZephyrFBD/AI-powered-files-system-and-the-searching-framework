V and I in Eq. 21–11a can refer either to rms for both, or to peak values for both

current and voltage are not reached at the same time; so Eq. 21–11a is not valid at
a particular instant, as is the case for a resistor

Capacitor
When a capacitor is connected to a battery, the capacitor plates quickly acquire
equal and opposite charges; but no steady current flows in the circuit. A capacitor
prevents the flow of a dc current. But if a capaci
