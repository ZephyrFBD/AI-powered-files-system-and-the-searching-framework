SYI-1
Living systems are organized in a hierarchy of structural levels that interact.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
SYI-1.H
Explain how the density 
of a population affects 
and is determined by 
resource availability in 
the environment.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SYI-1.H.1
A population can produce a density of 
individuals that exceeds the system’s resource 
availability.
SYI-1.H.2 
As limits to growth due to density-dependent 
and density-independent factors are imposed, a 
logistic growth model generally ensues.
