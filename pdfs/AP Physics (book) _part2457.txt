either
case?
APPROACH The signal is carried on a telephone wire or in the air via satellite.
In either case it is an electromagnetic wave. Electronics as well as the wire or
cable slow things down, but as a rough estimate we take the speed to be
SOLUTION The distance from New York to London is about 5000 km.
(a) The time delay via the cable is
(b) Via satellite the time would be longer because communications satellites,
which are usually geosynchronous (Example 5â€“12), move at a height of 
36,000 km. The signal would have to go up to the satellite and back down, or
about 72,000 km. The actual distance the signal would travel would be a little
more than this as the signal would go up and down on a diagonal (5000 km 
New York to London, small compared to the distance up to the satellite). Thus
, one way. Both directions
NOTE When the signal travels via the underwater cable, there is only a hint of a
delay and conversations are fairly normal. When the signal is sent via satellite, the
