no acids.
The newly formed polypeptide grows until a stop codon is reached.
The polypeptide or protein folds up and is released into the cell.
At the Same Time!
In prokaryotes, transcription and translation can be occurring at the same time.
This is because prokaryotes lack a nucleus and their transcription and
translation are both occurring in the same place, the cytoplasm.
REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION AND CELL SPECIALIZATION
What controls gene transcription, and how does an organism express only certain genes? Regulation of gene
expression can occur at different times. The largest point is before transcription, or pre-transcriptional regulation.
It can also occur post-transcriptionally or post-translationally.
The start of transcription requires DNA to be unwound and RNA polymerase to bind at the promoter. The process is
usually a bit more complicated than that because there is a group of molecules called transcription factors that can
either encourage or inhibit this from happening
