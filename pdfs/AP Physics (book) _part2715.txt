nteract weakly with each other and tend to align parallel to each
other, as shown in Fig. 24–50.
In a simple LCD, each pixel (picture element) contains liquid crystal material
sandwiched between two glass plates whose inner surfaces have been brushed 
to form nanometer-wide parallel scratches. The rod-like liquid crystal molecules
in contact with the scratches tend to line up along the scratches. The two plates
typically have their scratches at 90° to each other, and the weak electric forces
between the rod-like molecules tend to keep them nearly aligned with their
nearest neighbors, resulting in the twisted pattern shown in Fig. 24–51a.
The outer surfaces of the glass plates each have a thin film polarizer, they too
oriented at 90° to each other. Unpolarized light incident from the left becomes
plane-polarized, and the liquid crystal molecules keep this polarization aligned
with their rod-like shape. That is, the plane of polarization of the light rotates
with the molecules as the lig
