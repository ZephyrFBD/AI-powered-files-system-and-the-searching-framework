ertonic—are used to relate the osmolarity of a cell to the osmolarity of the
extracellular fluid that contains the cells. In a hypotonic situation, the extracellular fluid has lower osmolarity than the
fluid inside the cell, and water enters the cell. (In living systems, the point of reference is always the cytoplasm, so the
prefix hypo- means that the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes, or a lower osmolarity, than the cell
cytoplasm.) It also means that the extracellular fluid has a higher concentration of water in the solution than does the cell.
In this situation, water will follow its concentration gradient and enter the cell.
Hypertonic Solutions
As for a hypertonic solution, the prefix hyper- refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher osmolarity than the cell’s
cytoplasm; therefore, the fluid contains less water than the cell does. Because the cell has a relatively higher concentration
of water, water will leave the cell.
Isotonic Solutions
In an isot
