e convoluted tubule.
2. Secretion. As the filtrate passes through the proximal tubule and, later, through the distal tubule, additional
material from the interstitial fluids joins the filtrate. This added material, which originates from the capillary
network surrounding the nephron, is selectively secreted into the convoluted tubule by both passive and active
transport mechanisms.
3. Reabsorption. Salts and water are reabsorbed through passive and active transport channels by the surrounding
interstitial fluids as the filtrate passes through the proximal tubule. Then, as the filtrate moves down the loop of
Henle (also called the nephron loop), it becomes more
concentrated due to passive flow of H2O out of the tube. As the filtrate
moves up the loop of Henle, it becomes more dilute due to passive and active transport of salts out of the tubule. At
the end of the loop of Henle, then, the filtrate is not more concentrated. Rather, the interstitial fluids surrounding the
nephron are more c
