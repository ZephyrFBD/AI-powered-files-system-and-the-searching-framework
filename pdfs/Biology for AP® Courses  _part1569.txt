did he conclude from them?

a.
Two strains of S. pneumoniae were used for the
experiment. Griffith injected a mouse with heat-
inactivated S strain (pathogenic) and R strain
(non-pathogenic). The mouse died and S strain
was recovered from the dead mouse. He
concluded that external DNA is taken up by a
cell that changed morphol
