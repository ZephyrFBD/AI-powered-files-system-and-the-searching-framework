Different photosynthetic organisms have different types of chlorophyll molecules. 
The distribution of chlorophylls in several different groups of organisms is shown in 
Table 1. A plus sign (+) in the table indicates the presence of a chlorophyll, while a 
minus sign (−) indicates its absence.

9.	 Based on the data, which of the following most likely describes the evolutionary 
relationship among the organisms?
(A)	Because brown algae, red algae, and cyanobacteria lack chlorophyll b, they 
evolved before green algae and flowering plants did.
(B)	 Because green algae and flowering plants contain chloroplasts, they evolved 
more recently than brown algae, red algae, and cyanobacteria di
