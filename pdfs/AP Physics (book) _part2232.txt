that the angle is taken to be the angle between 
and the perpendicular to the
face of the coil, Fig. 20–34c. So the torque becomes

This formula, derived here for a rectangular coil, is valid for any shape of flat coil.
The quantity NIA is called the magnetic dipole moment of the coil:

orque on a coil. A circular loop of wire has a diameter of
20.0 cm and contains 10 loops. The current in each loop is 3.00 A, and the coil is
placed in a 2.00-T external magnetic field. Determine the maximum and mini-
mum torque exerted on the coil by the field.
APPROACH Equation 20–10 is valid for any shape of coil, including circular
loops.
