of DNA molecules taken by Rosalind
Franklin in the early 1950s. The cross 
of spots suggested that DNA is a helix.

shadowing.
FIGURE 25–42 Tomographic imaging: the
X-ray source and detector move together
across the body, the transmitted intensity
being measured at a large number of 
points. Then the “source–detector” assembly 
is rotated slightly (say, 1°) around a vertical
axis, and another scan is made. This process
is repeated for perhaps 180°. The computer
reconstructs the image of the slice and it is
presented on a TV or computer monitor.
