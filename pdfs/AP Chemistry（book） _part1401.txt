wo nuclei as occurring when a valence 
atomic orbital of one atom shares space, or overlaps, with a valence atomic orbital of 
another atom. The overlap of orbitals allows two electrons of opposite spin to share the 
space between the nuclei, forming a covalent bond.
Figure 9.12 shows three examples of how valence-bond theory describes the coming 
together of two atoms to form a molecule. In the example of the formation of H2, each 
hydrogen atom has a single electron in a 1s orbital. As the orbitals overlap, electron density 
is concentrated between the nuclei. Because the electrons in the overlap region are simul-
taneously attracted to both nuclei, they hold the atoms together, forming a covalent bond.
The idea of orbital overlap producing a covalent bond applies equally well to other 
molecules. In HCl, for example, chlorine has the electron configuration 3Ne43s23p5. All 
the valence orbitals of chlorine are full except one 3p orbital, which contains a single elec-
tron. This 3p el
