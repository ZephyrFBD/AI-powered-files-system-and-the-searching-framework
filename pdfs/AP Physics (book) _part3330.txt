30–1 Structure and Properties of
the Nucleus
An important question for physicists was whether the nucleus had a structure, and
what that structure might be. By the early 1930s, a model of the nucleus had been
developed that is still useful. According to this model, a nucleus is made up of
two types of particles: protons and neutrons. [These “particles” also have wave
properties, but for ease of visualization and language, we usually refer to them
simply as “particles.”] A proton is the nucleus of the simplest atom, hydrogen.
The proto
