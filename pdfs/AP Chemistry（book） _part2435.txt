 a gaseous equilib-
rium mixture causes the system to shift in the direction that reduces the number of moles of gas. 
Increasing the volume causes a shift in the direction that produces more gas molecules 
(Figure 15.13).

CHAPTER 15 Chemical Equilibrium
In the reaction N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ∆ 2 NH31g2, four molecules of reactant are 
consumed for every two molecules of product produced. Consequently, an increase in 
pressure (caused by a decrease in volume) shifts the reaction in the direction that pro-
duces fewer gas molecules, which leads to the formation of more NH3, as indicated in 
Figure 15.10. In the reaction H21g2 + I21g2 ∆ 2 HI1g2, the number of molecules of 
gaseous products (two) equals the number of molecules of gaseous reactants; therefore, 
changing the pressure does not influence the position of equilibrium.
Keep in mind that, as long as temperature remains constant, pressure–volume 
changes do not change the value of K. Rat
