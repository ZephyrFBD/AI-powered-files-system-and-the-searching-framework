Figure 34.16 Hormones control sperm production in a negative feedback system.
A negative feedback system occurs in the male with rising levels of testosterone acting on the hypothalamus and anterior
pituitary to inhibit the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) , FSH, and LH. The Sertoli cells produce the
hormone inhibin, which is released into the blood when the sperm count is too high. This inhibits the release of GnRH and
FSH, which will cause spermatogenesis to slow down. If the sperm count reaches 20 million/ml, the Sertoli cells cease the
release of inhibin, and the sperm count increases.
Female Hormones
The control of reproduction in females is more complex. As with the male, the anterior pituitary hormones cause the release
