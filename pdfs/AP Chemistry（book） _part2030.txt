ks consist of a pouch of water and the solid salt sealed off 
from the water—MgSO41s2 for hot packs and NH4NO31s2 for cold packs. When the pack 
is squeezed, the seal separating the solid from the water is broken and a solution forms, 
either increasing or decreasing the temperature. This means that a freshly made solution 
of MgSO4 in water feels warm and a freshly made solution of NH4NO3 feels cold.
The enthalpy change for a process can provide insight into the extent to which 
the process occurs. 
 (Section 5.4) Exothermic processes tend to proceed sponta-
neously. On the other hand, if ∆Hsoln is too endothermic, the solute might not dissolve 
to any significant extent in the chosen solvent. Thus, for solutions to form, the solvent– 
solute interaction must be strong enough to make ∆Hmix comparable in magnitude to 
∆Hsolute + ∆Hsolvent. This fact further explains why ionic solutes do not dissolve in non-
polar solvents. The nonpolar solvent molecules experience only weak attractive
