Determine molecular
geometry by counting only
bonding electron domains to
see the arrangement of 
bonded atoms (trigonal 
pyramidal).
Determine electron-domain 
geometry by counting all electron 
domains; then use Table 9.1 to 
determine the appropriate 
electron domain geometry.

the molecular geometry 
of NH3.
Figure 9.6 shows how to use the three steps in the VSEPR model to predict the geom-
etry of the NH3 molecule. The three bonds and one nonbonding pair in the Lewis struc-
ture tell us we have four electron domains. Thus, from Table 9.1, the electron-domain
