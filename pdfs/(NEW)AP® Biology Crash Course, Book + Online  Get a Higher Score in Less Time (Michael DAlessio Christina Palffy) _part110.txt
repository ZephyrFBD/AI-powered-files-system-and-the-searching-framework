coli (E. coli).
ii. When lactose is not present in its environment, E. coli has no need to turn on the lac operon
because there is no lactose to metabolize; so the repressor is bound to the operator, and the genes
are turned off.
iii. If lactose becomes available, it acts as an inducer by binding to the repressor and inactivating it so
that RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter and transcribe the structural genes.
iv. When the structural genes are translated into proteins, the proteins help the bacteria use lactose as
an energy source.
v. As the lactose is broken down and used by the bacteria, eventually none is left to bind to the
repressor to keep it inactive; so the repressor binds once again to the operator, thereby turning off
expression of the structural genes.
5. In this way, bacteria save resources and energy by turning off an operon when its gene products are
not needed.
Know the basic parts of an operon and how operons are turned on and off.
