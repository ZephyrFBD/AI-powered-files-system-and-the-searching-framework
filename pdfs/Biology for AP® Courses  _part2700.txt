Plant Responses to Gravity
Whether or not they germinate in the light or in total darkness, shoots usually sprout up from the ground, and roots

grow downward into the ground. A plant laid on its side in the dark will send shoots upward when given enough time.
Gravitropism ensures that roots grow into the soil and that shoots grow toward sunlight. Growth of the shoot apical tip
upward is called negative gravitropism, whereas growth of the roots downward is called positive gravitropism.
Amyloplasts (also known as statoliths) are specialized plastids that contain starch granules and settle downward in
