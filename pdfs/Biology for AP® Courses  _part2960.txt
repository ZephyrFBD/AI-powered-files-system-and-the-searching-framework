(98.6°F). Humans maintain this temperature even when the external temperature is hot or cold. It takes
energy to maintain this body temperature, and animals obtain this energy from food.
The primary source of energy for animals is carbohydrates, mainly glucose. Glucose is called the body’s fuel. The digestible
carbohydrates in an animal’s diet are converted to glucose molecules through a series of catabolic chemical reactions.
Adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, is the primary energy currency in cells; ATP stores energy in phosphate ester bonds. ATP
releases energy when the phosphodiester bonds are broken and ATP is converted to ADP and a phosphate group. ATP is
produced by the oxidative reactions in the cytoplasm and mitochondrion of the cell, where carbohydrates, proteins, and
fats undergo a series of metabolic reactions collectively called cellular respiration. For example, glycolysis is a series of
reactions in which glucose is converted to pyruvic acid and some of its chemical potenti
