iable(s) you 
chose as compared to the control(s)? 
3. Compare class data to explain how different variables affect rates of cellular  
respiration.  
■ Evaluating Results 
1. Was your initial hypothesis about the effect of your factor on the rate of cellular 
respiration supported? Why or why not? 
2. What were some challenges you had in performing your experiment? Did you make 
any incorrect assumptions? 
3. Were you able to perform without difficulty the mathematical routines required to 
analyze your data? If not, what calculations were challenging or required help from 
your classmates or teacher? 
■ Where Can You Go from Here? 
If time is available, ask your teacher if you can extend the investigation to explore 
answers to other questions that might have been raised as you conducted your 
experiment(s). For example, if you originally investigated the effect of temperature 
on metabolic rate in plant seeds, you might want to explore a different aspect, such 
as the effect of temp
