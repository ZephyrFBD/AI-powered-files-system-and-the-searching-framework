Long Free-Response
13. (a) Artificial selection was used in this experiment because the students selected for desired traits and chose
which plants would survive and reproduce.
(b)
(c) There is likely a statistically significant difference between the two groups because the 95% confidence
intervals (CI) of Generation 1 and Generation 2 do not overlap (the upper limit of the 95% CI for Generation
1 is 15.8 + 2(1.1) = 18 and the lower limit of the 95% CI for Generation 2 is 20.3 â€“ 2(0.9) = 18.5).
(d) The mean plant height for Generation 3 would likely be less than the mean plant height for Generation 2
because during this instance of artificial selection, only the plants with the combination of gene(s) for short
height were allowed to breed.
