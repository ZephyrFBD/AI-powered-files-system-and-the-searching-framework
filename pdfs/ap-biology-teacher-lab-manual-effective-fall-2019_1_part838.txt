Rate Curve for the Disappearance 
of A in Process IV 
Figure A.15 
In the progress curve on the left, we can see that after the first hour the reaction stopped. 
From the graph we can see that after 1 hour there were 50 mg of A remaining; after 2 
hours there were still 50 mg remaining; and there are still 50 mg remaining even at 4 
hours. Obviously, Process IV stopped when one-half of A had been used up. Now look 
at the rate curve on the right. It is perfectly flat for the first hour because the slope of the 
progress curve was constant during that time. After the first hour the rate curve is also 
perfectly flat but it has dropped down to 0, indicating that although
