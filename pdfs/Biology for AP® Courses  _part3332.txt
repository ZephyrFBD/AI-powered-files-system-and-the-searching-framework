cortex, and the gonads. During puberty in both males and females, the hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing
hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the production and release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing

hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. These hormones regulate the gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females)
and therefore are called gonadotropins. In both males and females, FSH stimulates gamete production and LH stimulates
production of hormones by the gonads. An increase in gonad hormone levels inhibits GnRH production through a negative
feedback loop.
Regulation of the Male Reproductive System
In males, FSH stimulates the maturation of sperm cells. FSH production is inhibited by the hormone inhibin, which is
released by the testes. LH stimulates production of the sex hormones (androgens) by the interstitial cells of the testes and
therefore is also called interstitial cell-stimulating hor
