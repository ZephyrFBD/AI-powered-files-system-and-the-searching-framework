n be supported by a habitat. Most
populations do not reach carrying capacity due to factors such as population density (density-independent
factors and density-dependent factors).
Exponential growth (J-shaped curve) occurs when a population is in an ideal environment. Logistic growth (S-
shaped curve) of a population occurs when there are limited resources in an environment.
Organisms are generally either r-strategists or k-strategists. The r-strategists ensure their survival by producing
lots of offspring. The k-strategists, which are usually large animals, produce few offspring but have longer life
spans and less competition from other organisms for resources.
Succession describes the way in which ecosystems recover after a disturbance in terms of pioneers, sere, climax
community, and secondary succession.
Human impact on the planet includes the following issues:
greenhouse effect
ozone depletion
acid rain
desertification
deforestation
pollution
reduction in biodiversity
