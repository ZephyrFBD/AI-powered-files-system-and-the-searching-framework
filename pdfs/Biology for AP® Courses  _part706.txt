lucose is broken down in the process
of glycolysis. In the first step of this process, ATP is required for the phosphorylation of glucose, creating a high-energy
but unstable intermediate. This phosphorylation reaction powers a conformational change that allows the phosphorylated
glucose molecule to be converted to the phosphorylated sugar fructose. Fructose is a necessary intermediate for glycolysis to
move forward. Here, the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis is coupled with the endergonic reaction of converting glucose
into a phosphorylated intermediate in the pathway. Once again, the energy released by breaking a phosphate bond within
ATP was used for the phosphorylation of another molecule, creating an unstable intermediate and powering an important
conformational change.
