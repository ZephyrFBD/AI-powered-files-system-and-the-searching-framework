 required to generate 1,000 copies of the desired DNA sequence.
Justify your prediction.
Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (C) Since the question states that the virusâ€™s genome contains uracil, choices (C) and (D) are possibilities since
RNA contains uracil and DNA does not; thus, rule out choices (A) and (B). However, since the percentage of
guanine does not equal the percentage of cytosine and the percentage of adenine does not equal the percentage
of uracil, it cannot be a double-stranded virus, so choice (C) is the best answer.
2. (A) Prokaryotes have circular chromosomes in the nucleoid region of their cells. Choice (B) is incorrect
because prokaryotes do not have a nucleus. Choices (C) and (D) are incorrect because prokaryotes do not have
linear chromosomes; eukaryotes have linear chromosomes.
3. (A) Since it has the lowest G-C content and since each G-C pair has three hydrogen bonds between them
(instead of the two hydrogen bonds that are between each A-T pair), choice (A)
