water.
(B) Water will flow into the blood cell because the blood cell has a higher water potential than distilled water.
(C) Water will flow out of the blood cell because the blood cell has a lower water potential than distilled water.
(D) Water will flow into the blood cell because the blood cell has a lower water potential than distilled water.
5. A plant cell with a solute potential of –4.0 bars and a pressure potential of 0.5 bars is placed into a solution with
a water potential of –5.0 bars. What will happen to the plant cell in this solution?
(A) Water will flow into the plant cell because the plant cell has a total water potential that is lower than that of
the surrounding solution.
(B) Water will flow into the plant cell because the plant cell has a total water potential that is higher than that
of the surrounding solution.
(C) Water will flow out of the plant cell because the plant cell has a total water potential that is lower than that
of the surrounding solution.
