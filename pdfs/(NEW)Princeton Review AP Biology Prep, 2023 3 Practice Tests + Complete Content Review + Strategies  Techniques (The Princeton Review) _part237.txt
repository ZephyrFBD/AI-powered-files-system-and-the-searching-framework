The light-dependent and light-independent reactions are inexorably linked; neither set of reactions alone can produce
carbohydrates from CO2. The light-dependent reactions use water and light to produce ATP, NADPH, and O2; the
light-independent reactions use CO2, ATP, and NADPH to produce ADP, NADPH+, and carbohydrates.
Stomata are pores on the leaf surface that allow CO2 to enter the leaf, and O2 and water to exit. Most plants close
their stomata on hot, dry days to prevent water loss by transpiration (the evaporative loss of water from leaves).
While this conserves water, it also limits access to CO2 and thus reduces photosynthetic yield. With less CO2
available, O2 accumulates and plants start performing photo​respiration instead of photosynthesis. Photorespiration
is a wasteful process that uses ATP and O2, produces more CO2, and doesn’t produce any sugars.
