e talked about the vast distances of objects in the universe. But how do
we measure these distances? One basic technique employs simple geometry to
measure the parallax of a star. By parallax we mean the apparent motion of
a star, against the background of much more distant stars, due to the Earth’s
motion around the Sun. As shown in Fig. 33–11, we can measure the angle 
that the star appears to shift, relative to very distant stars, when viewed 6 months
apart. If we know the distance d from Earth to Sun, we can reconstruct the right
triangles shown in Fig. 33–11 and can then determine the distance D to the 
star. This is essentially the way the heights of mountains are determined, by 
“triangulation”: see Example 1–8.

very small angle (less than
