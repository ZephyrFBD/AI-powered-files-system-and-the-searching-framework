e both events are independent of each other, you multiply the
probability of one by the probability of the other. (SYI-3 & SP 5)
(B) Here is the cross.
RR is round, RL is oval, and LL is long. The inheritance is an
example of incomplete dominance. (SYI-3)
(D) Since there are four genes (T, t, Y, and y) but only two
phenotypes in the offspring, the traits for height and seed color must
be linked, that is, on the same chromosome. So solve the problem
this way. Consider the traits separately at first. The phenotype ratio
in the offspring for height is 3 : 1, tall to short. Therefore, the
parents must be Tt and Tt. The phenotype ratio in the offspring for
seed color is 3 : 1, yellow to green. Therefore, the parents must be
Yy and Yy. Now, put both genotypes together. The parents must be
TtYy and TtYy. (IST-1 & SP 5)
(D) In blood type, both A and B are dominant over type O. A person
with blood type O must have two recessive genes (ii); one must
come from each parent. The parents, however, c
