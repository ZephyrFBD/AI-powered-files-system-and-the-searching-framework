oxygen on early Earth. In addition, oxygen is such a strong oxidizer
that no complex organic molecules would have formed early in
Earthâ€™s existence if oxygen had been present.
(D) The amount of energy in light is inversely proportional to its
wavelength. The shorter the wavelength of light, the more energy it
contains. The lines on the graph that are closest to the x-axis
represent the greatest amount of reduction and, therefore, the
greatest amount of photosynthesis. According to the graph, the most
reduction or photosynthesis occurs with two wavelengths of light
combined. The reason is that in chloroplasts, two photosystems,

P700 and P680, absorb light of different wavelengths. Choice (C) is
incorrect because the issue is how much light is absorbed (by the
two photosystems), not how much is being emitted. If 10 times the
light in the 1,000 nm range were shown on the plant, it would not
get absorbed because there woul
