 after being separated into single strands, the
multiple newly replicated DNA strands form a ladder because of the differing sizes. Because the ddNTPs are fluorescently
labeled, each band on the gel reflects the size of the DNA strand and the ddNTP that terminated the reaction. The different
colors of the fluorophore-labeled ddNTPs help identify the ddNTP incorporated at that position. Reading the gel on the
basis of the color of each band on the ladder produces the sequence of the template strand (Figure 17.13).
Figure 17.12 A dideoxynucleotide is similar in structure to a deoxynucleotide, but is missing the 3' hydroxyl group
(indicated by the box). When a dideoxynucleotide is incorporated into a DNA strand, DNA synthesis stops.
