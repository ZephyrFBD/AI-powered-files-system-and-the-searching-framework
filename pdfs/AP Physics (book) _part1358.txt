29. (I) (a) What resonant frequency would you expect from
blowing across the top of an empty soda bottle that is 24 cm
deep, if you assumed it was a closed tube? (b) How would
that change if it was one-third full of soda?
30. (I) If you were to build a pipe organ with open-tube pipes
spanning the range of human hearing (20 Hz to 20 kHz),
what would be the range of the lengths of pipes required?
31. (II) A tight guitar string has a frequency of 540 Hz as its
third harmonic. What will be its fundamental frequency if
it is fingered at a length of only 70% of its original length?
32. (II) Estimate the frequency
of the “sound of the ocean”
when you put your ear very
near a 15-cm-diameter sea-
shell (Fig. 12–35).

41. (II) How many overtones are present within the audible
range for a 2.18-m-long organ pipe at 20°C (a) if it is open,
and (b) if it is closed?
42. (II) Determine the fundamental and first overtone frequen-
cies when you are in a 9.0-m-long hallway with all doors
closed
