Prokaryotic versus Eukaryotic Gene Expression
To understand how gene expression is regulated, we must first understand how a gene codes for a functional protein in a
cell. The process occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, just in slightly different manners.
Prokaryotic organisms are single-celled organisms that lack a cell nucleus, and their DNA therefore floats freely in the cell
cytoplasm. To synthesize a protein, the processes of transcription and translation occur almost simultaneously. When the
resulting protein is no longer needed, transcription stops. As a result, the primary method to control what type of protein and
how much of each protein is expressed in a prokaryotic cell is the regulation of DNA transcription. All of the subsequent
steps occur automatically. When more protein is required, more transcription occurs. Therefore, in prokaryotic cells, the
control of gene expression is mostly at the transcriptional level.
