 to dissolve in another depends on the relative 
magnitudes of these three types of interactions. Solutions form when the magnitudes of 
the solvent–solute interactions are either comparable to or greater than the solute–solute 
and solvent–solvent interactions. For example, heptane 1C7H162 and pentane 1C5H122 dis-
solve in each other in all proportions. For this discussion, we can arbitrarily call heptane 
the solvent and pentane the solute. Both substances are nonpolar, and the magnitudes of 
the solvent–solute interactions (attractive dispersion forces) are comparable to the solute– 
solute and the solvent–solvent interactions. Thus, no forces impede mixing, and the ten-
dency to mix (increase entropy) causes the solution to form spontaneously.
An everyday example of solution formation occurs when you dissolve salt in 
water. Solid NaCl dissolves readily in water because the attractive solvent–solute inter-
actions between the polar H2O molecules and the ions are strong enough to ov
