writers of the show put a “Heisenberg compensator” into the 
transporter beam mechanism. Explain why such a compen-
sator (which is entirely ﬁctional) would be necessary to get 
around Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.

the Uncertainty Principle,” the essence of the uncertain-
ty principle is that we can’t make a measurement without

 6.105  Microwave ovens use microwave radiation to heat food. The 
energy of the microwaves is absorbed by water molecules in 
food and then transferred to other components of the food. 
(a) Suppose that the microwave radiation has a wavelength 
of 11.2 cm. How many photons are required to heat 200 mL of 
coffee from 23 to 60 °C? (b) Suppose the microwave’s power is 
900 W 11 watt = 1 joule@second2. How long would you have
