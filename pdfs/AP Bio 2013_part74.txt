Y  = solute potential 
 
The water potential will be equal to 
the solute potential of a solution in an 
open container because the pressure 
potential of the solution in an open 
container is zero.

i = ionization constant (this is 1.0 for 
sucrose because sucrose does not 
ionize in water) 
 
C = molar concentration 
 
R = pressure constant (R = 0.0831 liter 
bars/mole K) 
 
T = temperature in Kelvin (ºC + 273)
