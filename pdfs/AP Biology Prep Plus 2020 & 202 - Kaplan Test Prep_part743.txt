ic trees) is a skill you should practice and be able to perform
successfully.
Let’s use some data from an example in this investigation to construct a
cladogram based on genetic data. In humans, the GAPDH gene produces
a protein that catalyzes a step in glycolysis. The following table shows the
percentage similarity between the GAPDH gene and protein in humans
compared with four diﬀerent species.

Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes)
99.6%

Dog (Canis lupus familiaris)
91.3%
95.2%
Fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster)

Just as with the cladogram shown earlier in this chapter, we can use this
data to construct a cladogram that tells us how these species are related
to each other based on GADPH. There are five species being compared
here, so our cladogram will have five branches.
Reading the table, we see that
