 the bike.The manager 
 
 says ’tis good to get out in the fresh air. 
 
 Well, I’ll just go home and put my suitcase down and go to his 
 
 house. I thought he’d carry this for me. 
 
 I have the bike here and you can stick the case in the basket and I’ll 
 
 walk you home. 
 
 We walk up to her house in Carey’s Road and she tells me she’s so 
 
 excited about Gerry. She saved her money in England and now she 
 
 wants to go back with him and get married even if he’s only nineteen 
 
 and she’s only seventeen.What matter when you’re in love. I lived like 
 
 a nun in England and dreamt of him every night and thank you very 
 
 much for carrying my case. 
 
 I turn away to jump on the bike and cycle back to Easons when 
 
 Gerry comes at me from behind. His face is red and he’s snorting like 
 
 a bull. What were you doing with my girl, you little shite? Eh?

 What? If ’tis a thing I ever find out you did anything with my girl I’ll 
 
 kill you. 
 
 I didn’t do anything
