 to one another but differ in 
the spatial arrangement of these groups. 
 (Section 23.4) In the cis isomer the two 
methyl groups are on the same side of the double bond, whereas in the trans isomer they 
are on opposite sides. Geometric isomers possess distinct physical properties and can dif-
fer significantly from each other in their chemical behavior.
Geometric isomerism in alkenes arises because, unlike the C ¬C bond, the C “C 
bond resists twisting. Recall from Section 9.6 that the double bond between two carbon 
atoms consists of a s and a p bond. Figure 24.8 shows a cis alkene. The carbon–carbon 
bond axis and the bonds to the hydrogen atoms and to the alkyl groups (designated 
R) are all in a plane, and the p orbitals that form the p bond are perpendicular to that 
plane. As Figure 24.8 shows, rotation around the carbon–carbon double bond requires 
the p bond to be broken, a process that requires considerable energy (about 250 kJ>mol). 
Because rotation does not occur easily a
