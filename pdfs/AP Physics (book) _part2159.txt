67. Suppose that you wish to apply a 0.25-V potential difference
between two points on the human body. The resistance is
about 
and you only have a 1.5-V battery. How can
you connect up one or more resistors to produce the desired
voltage?
68. A three-way lightbulb can produce 50 W, 100 W, or 150 W,
at 120 V. Such a bulb contains two filaments that can be
connected to the 120 V individually or in parallel (Fig.19–74).
(a) Describe how the
connections to the
two filaments are
made to give each of
the three wattages.
(b) What must be the
resistance of each
filament?
