How Light-Dependent Reactions Work
The overall function of light-dependent reactions is to convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of NADPH
and ATP. This chemical energy supports the light-independent reactions and fuels the assembly of sugar molecules. The
light-dependent reactions are depicted in Figure 8.15. Protein complexes and pigment molecules work together to produce
NADPH and ATP.
Figure 8.15 A photosystem consists of a light-harvesting complex and a reaction center. Pigments in the light-
harvesting complex pass light energy to two special chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction center. The light excites
an electron from the chlorophyll a pair, which passes to the primary electron acceptor. The excited electron must the
