during this half to energize the separation. The second half of glycolysis extracts ATP and high-energy electrons from
hydrogen atoms and attaches them to NAD+. Two ATP molecules are invested in the first half and four ATP molecules are
formed by substrate phosphorylation during the second half. This produces a net gain of two ATP and two NADH
molecules for the cell.
7.3 Oxidation of Pyruvate and the Citric Acid Cycle
In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is transformed into an acetyl group attached to a carrier molecule of coenzyme A. The
resulting acetyl CoA can enter several pathways, but most often, the acetyl group is delivered to the citric acid cycle for
further catabolism. During the conversion of pyruvate into the acetyl group, a molecule of carbon dioxide and two high-
energy electrons are removed. The carbon dioxide accounts for two (conversion of two pyruvate molecules) of the six
carbons of the original glucose molecule. The electrons are picked up by NAD+, and the NADH c
