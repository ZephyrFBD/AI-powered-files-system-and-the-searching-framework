Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Growth rate affects the steepness of the exponential portion of the
curve: the incline before the plateau. The quicker the population gets to
The higher the plateau, the higher the carrying capacity. Populations A and B have the
same carrying capacity, and C has the lowest carrying capacity.
The steeper the curve before the plateau, the greater the growth rate. Population A has
the greatest growth rate, B has the second greatest, and C has the lowest growth rate.
its carrying capacity, the higher the growth rate. Population A has the
highest growth rate, followed by B, then C.

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Density-independent factors affect populations in the same way
regardless of how many individuals are in the population at that given time.
These factors tend to be abiotic factors, such
