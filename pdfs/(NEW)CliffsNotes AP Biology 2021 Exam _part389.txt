of the tRNA. Each tRNA has a special region of three nucleotides, called an anticodon.
During the process of translation, ribosomes direct the pairing of the anticodons of tRNAs with appropriate triplet
regions of the mRNA, called codons. Each mRNA codon specifies a particular amino acid. The genetic code
describes which amino acid is indicated by each of the 64 different mRNA codons. Some codons indicate a stop
code, signaling that translation of the mRNA is complete. Another codon indicates methionine, the start amino acid.
During translation, the ribosome provides binding sites to incoming tRNAs. Each tRNA brings the appropriate
amino acid as dictated by the codon sequence on the mRNA. As each new tRNA arrives, the growing polypeptide
chain that is attached to the previous tRNA is transferred to the new tRNA. The old tRNA is released; the ribosome
moves over one binding site; and the process repeats until the stop codon is encountered. At this point the ribosome
separates into two
