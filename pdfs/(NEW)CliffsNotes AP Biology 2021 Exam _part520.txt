synaptic cleft.
3. Neurotransmitter binds with postsynaptic receptors. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft
and binds with receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane. Different proteins are receptors for different
neurotransmitters.
4. The postsynaptic membrane is excited or inhibited. Depending upon the kind of neurotransmitter and the kind
of membrane receptors, there are two possible outcomes for the postsynaptic membrane.
If Na+gates open, the membrane becomes depolarized and results in an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP).
If the threshold potential is exceeded, an action potential is generated.
If K + or Clâˆ’gates open, the membrane becomes more polarized (hyperpolarized) and results in an inhibitory
postsynaptic potential (IPSP). As a result, it becomes more difficult to generate an action potential on this
membrane.
5. The neurotransmitter is degraded and recycled. After the neurotransmitter binds to the postsynaptic membrane
receptors, it is broken
