passage.
The enzymatic catalysis of a reaction essential in the production of dog saliva is mediated by
the protein ARKKKK60491. ARKKKK60491 is a homodimer, with each subunit being 337
amino acids. Figure 1, below, indicates a modular structure of the homodimer. Three positions are
indicated on the model. Position A is the active site. Position B is a region known to have a large
number of nonpolar residues. Position C is known to have a large number of charged residues.

37. A mutation is discovered in the gene for ARKKKK60491 that converts positively charged lysine residue into
negatively charged glutamic acid residue. This single change directly impacts the location where the substrate
to ARKKKK60491 attaches during catalysis. Which position is likely affected by this change?
(A) Position A
(B) Position B
(C) Position C
(D) None of the positions will be affected.
38. Which of the following is Position B most likely to assist the protein wi
