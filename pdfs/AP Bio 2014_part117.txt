Question 2 
 
Loeys-Dietz syndrome (type 2B) is a human genetic disorder associated with mutations in the LDS2B 
gene. Researchers have proposed that the LDS2B gene produces a growth factor receptor protein that 
regulates cell signaling pathways. The predicted product of the gene is a 565-amino acid protein with 
structural regions that bind to signaling molecules, span the plasma membrane, and have protein kinase 
activity. Protein kinases are cellular enzymes that transfer phosphate groups from ATP to target proteins. 
A representation of the LDS2B gene is shown in Figure 1.
