 24.20. However, if an animal has not eaten
and blood glucose levels decrease, this is sensed in another group of cells in the pancreas, and the hormone glucagon is
released causing glucose levels to increase. This is still a negative feedback loop, but not in the direction expected by the
use of the term “negative.” Another example of an increase as a result of the feedback loop is the control of blood calcium.
If calcium levels decrease, specialized cells in the parathyroid gland sense this and release parathyroid hormone (PTH),
causing an increased absorption of calcium through the intestines and kidneys and, possibly, the breakdown of bone in order
to liberate calcium. The effects of PTH are to raise blood levels of the element. Negative feedback loops are the predominant
mechanism used in homeostasis.
