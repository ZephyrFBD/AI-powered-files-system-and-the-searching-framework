rk through the introductory material, several questions will emerge 
about transformation and the use of plasmids to transfer genetic information. One 
strategy for prelab assessment is to join student groups, encourage them to ask questions 
beyond those listed in the investigation, listen to their answers, and then ask more 
probing questions. 
 
Using Plasmids with Colored Marker Genes 
If you choose a plasmid system that includes colored marker genes like beta-GAL and 
fluorescent markers like GFP and its cousins, you might want to consider taking students 
through a more in-depth prelab activity. This activity is also appropriate for students 
who are familiar with transformation experiments performed in a previous biology class. 
Using pGLO plasmid to transform bacteria, students observe the expression of green 
fluorescent protein (GFP). Students can work through the activity for homework or as a 
group.
