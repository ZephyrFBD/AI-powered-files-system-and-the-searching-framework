Alkali metal ions tend to play an unexciting role in most chemical 
reactions. As noted in Section 4.2, all salts of the alkali metal ions are 
soluble in water, and the ions are spectators in most aqueous reac-
tions (except for those involving the alkali metals in their elemental 
form, such as those in Equations 7.16 through 7.2
