 says, I’m escaping, jumps on his horse and winds up in New York. Dad 
 
 says he doesn’t mind if I read silly English books by P.G.Wodehouse as 
 
 long as I don’t forget the men who did their bit and gave their lives for 
 
 Ireland. 
 
 I can’t stay at home forever and Mam takes me back to Leamy’s 
 
 School in November. The new headmaster, Mr. O’Halloran, says he’s 
 
 sorry, I’ve missed over two months of school and I have to be put back 
 
 in fifth class. Mam says surely I’m ready for sixth class.After all, she says, 
 
  
  
 he’s missed only a few weeks. Mr. O’Halloran says he’s sorry, take the 
 
 boy next door to Mr.O’Dea. 
 
 We walk along the hallway and I tell Mam I don’t want to be in fifth 
 
 class. Malachy is in that class and I don’t want to be in a class with my 
 
 brother who is a year younger. I made my Confirmation last year. He 
 
 didn’t. I’m older. I’m not bigger anymore because of the typhoid but 
 
 I’m older.
