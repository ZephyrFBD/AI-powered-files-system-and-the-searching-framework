 most at-
oms, are those in the outermost occupied shell. 
 (Section 6.8) The American chemist 
G. N. Lewis (1875–1946) suggested a simple way of showing the valence electrons in an 
atom and tracking them during bond formation, using what are now known as either 
Lewis electron-dot symbols or simply Lewis symbols.
The Lewis symbol for an element consists of the element’s chemical symbol 
plus a dot for each valence electron. Sulfur, for example, has the electron configuration 
3Ne43s23p4 and therefore six valence electrons. Its Lewis symbol is
