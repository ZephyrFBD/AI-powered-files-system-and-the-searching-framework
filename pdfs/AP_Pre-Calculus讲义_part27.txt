on we conclude that the average rate of change of a linear function 
is the same between any two points. 
Moreover, the average rate of change is equal to the slope. 
Since the average rate of change of a linear function is the same between any two points, 
it is simply called the rate of change.

For the linear function f(x) = ax + b, the slope of the graph of f and the rate of change of f 
are both equal to a, the coefficient of x. 
a = slope of graph of f = rate of change of f 
 
Example 2 
A dam is built on a river to create a reservoir. The water level f (t) in the reservoir at time t 
is given by f (t) = 4.5t + 28, where t is the number of years since the dam was constructed 
and f (t) is measured in feet. 
(a) Sketch a graph of f. 
(b) What is the slope of the graph? 
(c) At what rate is the water level in the reservoir changing?
