 charts.
3. If a model is given, be able to interpret and explain the model.
B. Science Practice 2—Visual Representations (Examples include Mathematical Models, Diagrams, and
Flow Charts)
1. Use or create proper graphs and data tables to represent concepts, processes, or models.
2. Explain relationships between different concepts and processes and how these representations relate to
larger biological principles.
C. Science Practice 3—Questions and Methods
1. Design an appropriate experiment or evaluate an experimental design.
2. Write a testable question, state a hypothesis, determine appropriate control and experimental groups,
identify independent and dependent variables, collect appropriate data, evaluate the data, and decide
on the next experiment that should be done.
D. Science Practice 4—Representing and Describing Data (Examples include Bar; Line; Box and
Whisker; Pie; Histogram; Log Y; and Dual Y)
1. Create or describe data in a table, graph, or other appropriate figure.
2. Acc
