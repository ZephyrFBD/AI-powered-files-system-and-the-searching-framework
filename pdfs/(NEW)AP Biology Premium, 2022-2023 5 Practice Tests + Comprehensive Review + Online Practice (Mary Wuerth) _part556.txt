Biodiversity depends on both abiotic (nonliving) and biotic (living) factors. Abiotic factors, such as climate and
water availability, will influence the types of species and the number of organisms of each species that are found in
an ecosystem. Biotic factors, such as the number of producers, will limit how many consumers can survive in an
ecosystem. The biodiversity of an ecosystem will influence the structure of the food chains and food webs found in
that ecosystem.
Keystone species have a disproportionally large effect on an ecosystem compared to their numbers. When
wolves were hunted to levels that neared extinction in Yellowstone National Park 100 years ago, deer populations in
the park increased. This overpopulation of deer led to a decrease in the biodiversity in plant species. Other animal
species that depended on these plant species declined in numbers. When wolves were reintroduced in the 1990s,
