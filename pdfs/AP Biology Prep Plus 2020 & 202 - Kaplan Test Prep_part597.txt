pression in areas of the body posterior to the forelimb region.
The figure below shows the length of a developing embryo with
the head (cephalic) region at the top and the tail (caudal) region at
the bottom. It shows a neural tube (NT), which will become the
spinal cord; somites; and lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), which will
give rise to limbs and other structures.

Based on the information provided, which of the following is the
most reasonable conclusion?
The Hoxc9 regulatory complex will exert negative control in
the caudal region, so the forelimb will develop in the rostral
region.
(A)
The Hoxc9 regulatory complex will exert negative control in
the rostral region, so the forelimb will develop in the rostral
region.
(B)
The Hoxc9 regulatory complex will
