olume outside the semipermeable membrane 
is large, as the illustration shows, what would you expect for 
the solution volume inside the balloon once the system has 
come to equilibrium through osmosis? [Section 13.5]

CHAPTER 13 Properties of Solutions
 13.12  Which diagram best represents a liquid–liquid emulsion 
such as milk? The colored balls represent different liquid 
molecules. [Section 13.6]
(a)
(b)
(c)
The Solution Process (Section 13.1)
 13.13  Indicate whether each statement is true or false:
(a) A solute will dissolve in a solvent if solute–solute interac-
tions are stronger than solute–solvent interactions.
(b) In making a solution, the enthalpy of mixing is always a 
positive number.
(c)  An increase in entropy favors mixing.
 13.14  Indicate whether each statement is true or false: (a) NaCl 
dissolves in water but not in benzene 1C6H62 because ben-
zene is denser than water. (b) NaCl dissolves in water but 
not in benzene because water has a large dipole moment 
and
