 heat can be conducted from the
interior of the body to the surface. As a model, assume that
the thickness of tissue is 4.0 cm, that the skin is at 34°C 
and the interior at 37°C, and that the surface area is 
Compare this to the measured value of about 230 W that
must be dissipated by a person working lightly. This clearly
shows the necessity of convective cooling by the blood.
53. A bicyclist consumes 9.0 L of water over the span of 3.5 hours
during a race. Making the approximation that 80% of the
cyclist’s energy goes into evaporating this water (at 20°C)
as sweat, how much energy in kcal did the rider use during
the ride? [Hint: See page 399.]
54. If coal gives off 
when burned, how much coal is
needed to heat a house requiring 
for the whole
winter? Assume that 30% of the heat is lost up the chimney.
55. A 15-g lead bullet is tested by firing it into a fixed block of
wood with a mass of 35 kg. The block and imbedded bullet
together absorb all the heat generated. After thermal equi
