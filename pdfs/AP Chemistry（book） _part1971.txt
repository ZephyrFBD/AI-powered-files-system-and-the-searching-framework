They can behave as either semiconductors or metals depending on 
how the sheet was rolled. Graphene, which is an isolated layer from 
graphite, is a two-dimensional form of carbon. These nanomaterials 
are being developed now for many applications in electronics, batter-
ies, solar cells, and medicine.
