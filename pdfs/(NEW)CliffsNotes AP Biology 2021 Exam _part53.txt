holipid are nonpolar and hydrophobic, and the phosphate
“head” is polar and hydrophilic. Phospholipids are often found oriented in sandwich-like formations, with the
hydrophobic tails grouped together on the inside of the sandwich and the hydrophilic heads oriented toward the
outside and facing an aqueous environment. Such formations of phospholipids provide the structural foundation of
cell membranes.

3. Steroids are characterized by a backbone of four linked carbon rings (Figure 2-8). Examples of steroids include
cholesterol (a component of cell membranes) and certain hormones, including testosterone and estrogen.

Proteins
Proteins can be grouped according to their functions. Some major categories follow:
 
1. Structural proteins, such as keratin in the hair and horns of animals, collagen in connective tissues, and silk in
spider webs
 
2. Storage proteins, such as casein in milk, ovalbumin in egg whites, and zein in corn seeds
3. Transport proteins, such as tho
