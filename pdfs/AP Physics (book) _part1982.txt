The charge that flows per second,
is the electric current I. Thus we have
(18;5)
This general relation gives us the power transformed by any device, where I is the
current passing through it and V is the potential difference across it. It also gives
the power delivered by a source such as a battery. The SI unit of electric power is
the same as for any kind of power, the watt
The rate of energy transformation in a resistance R can be written in two
other ways, starting with the general relation 
and substituting in Ohm’s
law,
(18;6a)

Equations 18–6a and b apply only to resistors, whereas Eq. 18–5,
is
more general and applies to any device.
