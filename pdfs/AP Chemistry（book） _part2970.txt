is found in most detergents. Assume that the anion under-
goes aerobic decomposition in the following manner:
2 C18H29SO3
-1aq2 + 51 O21aq2 ยก
36 CO21aq2 + 28 H2O1l2 + 2 H+1aq2 + 2 SO4

What is the total mass of O2 required to biodegrade 10.0 g 
of this substance?
 18.50  The average daily mass of O2 taken up by sewage discharged 
in the United States is 59 g per person. How many liters of 
water at 9 ppm O2 are 50 % depleted of oxygen in 1 day by a 
population of 1,200,000 people?
 18.51  Magnesium ions are removed in water treatment by the 
addition of slaked lime, Ca1OH22. Write a balanced chemi-
cal equation to describe what occurs in this process.
 18.52  In the lime soda process once used in large scale munici-
pal water softening, calcium hydroxide prepared from lime 
and sodium carbonate are added to precipitate Ca2+ as 
CaCO31s2 and Mg2+ as Mg1OH22 1s2:
Ca2+1aq2 + CO3
2-1aq2 ยก CaCO31s2
 Mg 2+1aq2 + 2 OH-1aq2 ยก MgOH2
