8.6 Incomplete Lewis structures for the nitrous acid molecule, 
HNO2, and the nitrite ion, NO2
-, are shown here. (a) Com-
plete each Lewis structure by adding electron pairs as needed. 
 
(b) Is the formal charge on N the same or different in these 
two species? (c) Would either HNO2 or NO2
- be expected to 
exhibit resonance? (d) Would you expect the N “ O bond in 
HNO2 to be longer, shorter, or the same length as the N ¬ O 
bonds in NO2
-? [Sections 8.5 and 8.6]

8.7 The partial Lewis structure that follows is for a hydrocar-
bon molecule. In the full Lewis structure, each carbon atom 
satisfies the octet rule, and there are no unshared elec-
tron pairs in the molecule. The carbon—carbon bonds 
are labeled 1, 2, and 3. (a) How many hydrogen at-
oms are in the molecule? (b) Rank the carbon–carbon 
bonds in order of increasing bond length. (c) Which 
 
carbon—carbon bond is the strongest one? [Sections 8.3 
and 8.8]
