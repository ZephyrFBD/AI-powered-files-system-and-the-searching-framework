he B atoms, the shape is called trigonal 
planar. If the A atom lies above the plane of the B atoms, the shape is called trigonal pyra-
midal (a pyramid with an equilateral triangle as its base). Some AB3 molecules, such as 
ClF3, are T-shaped, a relatively unusual shape shown in Figure 9.2. The atoms lie in one 
plane with two B¬A¬B angles of about 90°, and a third angle close to 180°.
Quite remarkably, the shapes of most ABn molecules can be derived from just five 
basic geometric arrangements, shown in Figure 9.3. All of these are highly symmetric 
arrangements of the n B atoms around the central A atom. We have already seen the first 
three shapes: linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral. The trigonal bipyramid shape for
