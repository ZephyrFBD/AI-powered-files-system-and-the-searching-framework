e equals the amount of carbon lost during respiration. To calculate the gross primary productivity
(GPP), the absolute value of the lost carbon needs to be added back to the carbon produced from net primary
productivity (NPP):
GPP = NPP + R = 0.056 + 0.030 = 0.086, which rounds to 0.09 mg fixed carbon/L
3. Answer: 0.80
The data from the electrophoresis banding patterns represent phenotypic frequencies of an enzyme trait, that is, p2,
2pq, and q2. The lane that has two bands represents the heterozygous individuals (2pq). If
then q = 0.2; and if
 
Note that p +
q = 1.
4. Answer: 1.00
To solve this problem, look at each gene separately. For the first gene, the cross AA × aa produces offspring that are
all Aa, so the probability for Aa among offspring is 1. Repeating this for B, C, and D gives probabilities for Bb, Cc,
and Dd among offspring each equal to 1. Multiplying the probability for each gene, 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 gives a probability
of 1 for the AaBbCcDd genotype. You could have also just
