tle. Cattle dying of the disease were shown to have developed
lesions or “holes” in the brain, causing the brain tissue to resemble a sponge. Later on in the outbreak, however, it was
shown that a similar encephalopathy in humans known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) could be acquired from
eating beef from animals with BSE, sparking bans by various countries on the importation of British beef and causing
considerable economic damage to the British beef industry (Figure 21.18). BSE still exists in various areas, and although a
rare disease, individuals that acquire CJD are difficult to treat. The disease can be spread from human to human by blood,

The cause of spongiform encephalopathies, such as kuru and BSE, is an infectious structural variant of a normal cellular
protein called PrP (prion protein). It is this variant that constitutes the prion particle. PrP exists in two forms, PrPc, the
