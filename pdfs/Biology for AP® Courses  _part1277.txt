el set the framework
for genetics by studying a simple biological system, the garden pea. He conducted methodical, quantitative analyses using
large sample sizes. Mendel’s work laid the foundation for the fundamental principles of heredity. We now know that genes,
carried on chromosomes, are the basic functional units of heredity with the capacity to be replicated, expressed, repressed,
modified and mutated. Today, the postulates put forth by Mendel form the basis of classical, or Mendelian, genetics. Genes
do not all obey the tenets of Mendelian genetics, but Mendel’s experiments serve as an excellent starting point for thinking
about inheritance.
An understanding of genetic inheritance enables scientists to study and explain complex phenomena. For example,
scientists studied the remains of 84 ancient dogs from North and South America. They found that some of the dogs
had greater genetic diversity, indicating that these dogs might have interbred with American wolves. Other dogs in the
