aneous as the number of
enzyme molecules becomes equal to the number of substrate molecules.
An increase in enzyme concentration is like every customer in the grocery
store having his or her own cashier. A customer would move through the
line as quickly as the cashier can check him or her out. In the world of
enzymes, orders are processed very quickly. Catalase can convert almost
6 million molecules of H2O2 to H2O and O2 each minute.
By completing this simple experiment with one enzyme catalyzing one
reaction, you not only learn about catalase and H2O2, you also learn
about enzyme properties and the eï¬€ect the environment has on chemical
reactions. The type of reaction completed in the experiment was
oxidation-reduction, in which the active site of the enzyme catalase is a
heme group like in hemoglobin, so it has a similar tertiary and quaternary
structure. The reason the catalase enzyme exists in animal and plant
tissue is to remove H2O2, an oxidizer that is dangerous to living cells a
