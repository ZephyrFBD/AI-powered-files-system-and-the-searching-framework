distinct types. Over great lengths of time, disruptive selection may result in
the formation of two new species.
Imagine that an environment with very light rocks and very dark soil is
colonized by light, intermediate-colored, and dark mice. The frequency of
very light and very dark mice, which are both camouflaged, would
increase, while the intermediate-colored mice would die out because of
predation. Pressure from the environment selects for two extreme
characteristics.
3. Directional Selection
Changing environmental conditions give rise to directional selection,
where one phenotype replaces another in the gene pool. Here are two

examples of directional selection.

Environments change and act as a selective mechanism on populations.
One example of directional selection is industrial melanism in
peppered moths, Biston betularia. Until 1845 in England, most
peppered moths were light; a few individuals were found to be
