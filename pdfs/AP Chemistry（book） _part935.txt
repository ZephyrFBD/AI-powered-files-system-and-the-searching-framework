weaknesses in 
some interpretations of quantum results, but the paradox has led 
 
instead to a continuing and lively debate about the fate and meaning 
of Schrödinger’s cat. In 2012, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded 
to Serge Haroche of France and David Wineland of the United States 
for their ingenious methods for observing the  
quantum states of 
photons or particles without having the act of observation  
destroy 
the states. In so doing, they observed what is generally called the 
“cat state” of the systems, in which the photon or particle exists 
 
simultaneously in two different quantum states. A puzzling paradox, 
indeed, but one that might ultimately lead to new ways to harness 
the simultaneous states to create so-called quantum computers and 
more accurate clocks.
