ht be similar to chemically, and tell why you think it
might be dangerous to ingest. It has too many neutrons to
be stable, and it decays with a half-life of about 29 yr. How
long will we have to wait for the amount of 
on the
Earth’s surface to reach 1% of its current level, assuming
no new material is scattered about? Write down the decay
reaction, including the daughter nucleus. The daughter is
radioactive: write down its decay.
69. The activity of a sample of 
is
decays per second. What is the mass of the
sample?
70. The nuclide 
decays with 
energy of 0.14 MeV
accompanied by 
rays of energy 0.042 MeV and
0.129 MeV. (a) What is the daughter nucleus? (b) Draw an
energy-level diagram showing the ground states of the
parent and daughter and excited states of the daughter.
(c) To which of the daughter states does 
decay of 
occur?
