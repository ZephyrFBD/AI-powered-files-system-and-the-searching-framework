CHAPTER 4
Dynamics: Newton’s Laws of Motion
†The concept of “vertical” is tied to gravity. The best definition of vertical is that it is the direction in
which objects fall. A surface that is “horizontal,” on the other hand, is a surface on which a round
object won’t start rolling: gravity has no effect. Horizontal is perpendicular to vertical.
‡Since
(Section 4–4), then 1 ms2 = 1 Nkg.
1 N = 1 kgms2
