orresponds exactly to the true values. (In real
situations, the true values are not known, which is why these computer tech-
niques are required.) To obtain these numbers exactly, we used six pieces of
information (two each at angles 1 and 2, one each at angles 3 and 4). For the
much larger number of pixels used for actual images, exact values are generally
not attained. Many iterations may be needed, and the calculation is considered
sufficiently precise when the difference between calculated and measured
projections is sufficiently small. The above example illustrates the “convergence”
of the process: the first iteration (b to c in Fig. 25–46) changed the values by 2,
the last iteration (c to d) by only 1
