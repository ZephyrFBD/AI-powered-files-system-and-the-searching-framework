colors, and trigger flower petals to die. Gibberellins are plant hormones
that regulate growth and influence developmental processes by acting as
a chemical messenger that stimulates cell elongation, breaking and
budding, and seed germination.
AP EXPERT NOTE
The important thing to remember is that genes are always present
in an organism’s DNA, but certain environmental variables aﬀect
their expression.
Molecules in the extracellular environment may also be signal molecules
released from other cells. Haploid yeast cells come in two mating types—a
and α (alpha)—and respond to the mating pheromones produced by the
opposite type. Upon contact, the two fuse to form a diploid zygote.
Signals in embryos of multicellular organisms typically regulate
expression of certain genes in targeted cells via induction. In cell-to-cell
interactions, cytokines, molecules secreted by cells, signal other cells to
begin cell replication and division. During pattern formation, cells of the
developing embryo
