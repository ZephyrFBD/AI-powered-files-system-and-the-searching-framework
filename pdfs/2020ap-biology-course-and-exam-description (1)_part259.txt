d encourage a conceptual 
understanding of biology. Ideally, the textbook will 
include multiple examples and approaches to enable 
students to make connections across different domains 
within biology and between biology and other social 
and natural sciences.
College Board does not endorse any particular 
textbook, and the AP Biology Development Committee 
does not use any specific book when creating the 
exam. Therefore, when choosing a textbook, you 
should take into account many factors such as 
content, readability, learning level, and availability of 
ancillary materials. On the AP Central page for this 
course, youâ€™ll find an example textbooks list of college-
level textbooks that meet the AP Biology Course Audit 
curricular requirements.
When planning instruction, it is advisable to consult 
multiple books and resources in addition to the selected 
textbook, to gain additional perspectives on the various 
concepts in the course that students need to learn.
