different parts of the nervous system. There are
four major types of neurons, and they share several important cellular components.
Neurons
The nervous system of the common laboratory fly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains around 100,000 neurons, the same
number as a lobster. This number compares to 75 million in the mouse and 300 million in the octopus. A human brain
contains around 86 billion neurons. Despite these very different numbers, the nervous systems of these animals control
many of the same behaviors—from basic reflexes to more complicated behaviors like finding food and courting mates. The
ability of neurons to communicate with each other as well as with other types of cells underlies all of these behaviors.
Most neurons share the same cellular components. But neurons are also highly specialized—different types of neurons have
different sizes and shapes that relate to their functional roles.
Parts of a Neuron
Like other cells, each neuron has a cell body (or soma) that cont
