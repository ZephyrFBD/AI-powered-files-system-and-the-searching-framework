fects on every aspect of the biosphere, from the
global level to individual species.

Energy Flow
A. Trophic Levels—division of organisms in an ecosystem; energy flows through an ecosystem from lower
trophic levels to higher trophic levels.
1. Primary Producers—comprise the first trophic level and are almost exclusively dependent on solar
energy; they are photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and blue-green algae.
2. Consumers—organisms that comprise subsequent levels and that are ultimately dependent on
producers for their energy needs.

Primary Consumers—herbivores or plant-eating organisms.
ii. Secondary Consumers—carnivores that eat the primary consumers.
iii. Tertiary Consumers—carnivores that eat other carnivores or organisms below them.
3. Detritivores—derive their energy from dead organisms or detritus (i.e., fungi and soil microbes); they
are extremely helpful in recycling matter.
B. Food Chains and Food Webs—illustrate energy interactions between members of a specific
