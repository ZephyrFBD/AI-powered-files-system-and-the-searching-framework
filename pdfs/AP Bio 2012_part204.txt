The student is able write a coherent paragraph with 
appropriate terminology to correctly identify two kinds of 
data that could be collected. For each of the data, the student 
explains with justification how the selection of the data 
addresses the question of whether the populations growing 
above 2,500 meters and the populations growing below 
2,300 meters represent a single species. Given the scenario, 
the student is able to identify that the plant populations have 
the potential to interbreed in nature and produce viable  
and/or fertile offspring. The student is also able to identify 
that the two plant populations may have the ability to  
cross-pollinate and/or germinate seeds, as another 
appropriate type of data. For any of these data sets, the
