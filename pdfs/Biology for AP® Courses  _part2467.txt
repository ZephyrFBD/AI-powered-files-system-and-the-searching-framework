Figure 22.17 Besides binary fission, there are three other mechanisms by which prokaryotes can exchange DNA. In
(a) transformation, the cell takes up prokaryotic DNA directly from the environment. The DNA may remain separate as
plasmid DNA or be incorporated into the host genome. In (b) transduction, a bacteriophage injects DNA into the cell
that contains a small fragment of DNA from a different prokaryote. In (c) conjugation, DNA is transferred from one cell
to another via a mating bridge that connects the two cells after the sex pilus draws the two bacteria close enough to
form the bridge.

The Evolution of Prokaryotes
How do scientists answer questions about the evolution of prokaryotes? Unlike with animals, artifacts in
the fossil record of prokaryotes offer very little information. Fossils of ancient prokaryotes look like tiny
bubbles in r
