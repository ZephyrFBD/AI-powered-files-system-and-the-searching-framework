e (C) is incorrect because
even though it correctly plots the means, it does not correctly plot the 95% confidence intervals. Also, it is a line
graph, which is inappropriate for categorical data, such as the data in this question. Choice (D) plots the means
and confidence intervals correctly, but it is a line graph, which is inappropriate for the categorical data given in
the question, so it is incorrect.
4. (D) The 95% confidence intervals of rubbing alcohol and olive oil do overlap, so these two liquids are the least
likely to have a statistically significant difference. Choice (A) is incorrect because the confidence intervals for
water and rubbing alcohol do not overlap. Since the confidence intervals for water and olive oil do not overlap,
they are more likely to have a statistically significant difference, so choice (B) is incorrect. Similarly, the
confidence intervals for water and rubbing alcohol do not overlap, so they also are likely to have a statistically
significant differ
