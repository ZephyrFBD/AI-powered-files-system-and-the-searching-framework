The magnification, m, of a mirror is defined as the height of the image
divided by the height of the object. From our first set of similar triangles in
Fig. 23–16, or the first equation just below Fig. 23–16, we can write:
(23;3)
The minus sign in Eq.23–3 is inserted as a convention. Indeed, we must be careful about
the signs of all quantities in Eqs. 23–2 and 23–3. Sign conventions are chosen so as
to give the correct locations and orientations of images, as predicted by ray diagrams.
The sign conventions we use are:
1. the image height 
is positive if the image is upright, and negative if inverted,
relative to the object (assuming 
is taken as positive);
2.
or 
is positive if image or object is in front of the mirror (as in Fig. 23–16);
if either image or object is beh
