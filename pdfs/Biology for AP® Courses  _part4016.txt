An allergy is caused by the immune system reacting to a
foreign protein to produce IgE molecules that recognize
the protein. These IgE molecules become associated with
mast cells that respond to future exposures to the protein
by releasing histamines into the body. The diagram shows
this release and also shows how a drug called an
antihistamine can help an allergy sufferer reduce their
allergy symptoms. Which of the following statements
explains how an antihistamine helps restore homeostasis
during an allergic reaction?
