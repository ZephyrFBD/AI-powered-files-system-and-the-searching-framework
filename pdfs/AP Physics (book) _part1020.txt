hree phases is as follows. A solid maintains a generally
fixed size and shape; usually it requires a large force to change the volume or
shape of a solid† (although a thin object might bend). A liquid does not maintain
a fixed shape—it takes on the shape of its container, and it can flow; but like a solid
it is not readily compressible, and its volume can be changed significantly only by a
very large force. A gas has neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume—it will expand
to fill its container. For example, when air is pumped into an automobile tire, the
air does not all run to the bottom of the tire as a liquid would; it spreads out to fill
the whole volume of the tire.
Because liquids and gases do not maintain a fixed shape, they both have the
ability to flow. They are thus referred to collectively as fluids.
The division of matter into three phases is not always simple. How, for example,
should butter be classified? Furthermore, a fourth phase of matter can be distin-
guished, the p
