 high doses of a drug would be toxic while lower doses would be
potentially therapeutic. (B) is incorrect because, even though changes
in metabolic pathways may occur with very large doses of some drugs,
this is not generally true of most drugs, nor does it account for the fact
that, in many cases, it is the drug itself and not its metabolites that
exert toxic eﬀects. As such, (B) would account only for a very small
minority of cases of toxicity. (D) is incorrect because impurities are
typically present at such low concentrations that they never become
physiologically relevant.
33. B
Diﬀerential gene expression is controlled at the level of mRNA
synthesis, which is controlled by transcription factors and other
mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and chromatin condensation.
Thus, while all of a multicellular organism’s cells will contain the same
DNA, these diﬀerences in expression result in diﬀerent types of cells.
(B) is correct. (A) is incorrect because the mRNA that is transcribed
