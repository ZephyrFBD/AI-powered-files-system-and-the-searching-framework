 and a spade consecutively from a deck of cards if the first draw
was replaced before the second draw?
Solution:
P(heart) = 
 = 
P(spade) = 
 = 
P(heart and spade) = P(heart) × P(spade)
Sum Rule
The sum rule is used for studying two mutually exclusive events, and can be thought of as the “EITHER” rule. The
probability of either of two events occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities.
Example: What is the probability of drawing a diamond or a heart from a deck of cards?
Solution:
If the events you are studying are not mutually exclusive, such as having brown hair and brown eyes, then you could
have both occur at the same time. If you are trying to determine the likelihood of EITHER occurring but NOT
BOTH, then you must calculate using the sum rule (odds of either occurring) and the product rule (odds of both
occurring). Then, take the result using the product rule and subtract it from the result when using the sum rule since
you want the odds of either occurring but not bot
