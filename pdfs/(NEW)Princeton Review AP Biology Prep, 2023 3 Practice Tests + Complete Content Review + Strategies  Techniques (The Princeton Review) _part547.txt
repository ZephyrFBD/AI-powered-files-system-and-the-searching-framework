 H0. Our H0 is that the observed and expected data match and that the experimental plants have
a 3:1 ratio of yellow to green plants. Based on this, the only possible answer choices are (B) and (C); the other
choices mix up how χ2 values and critical values are compared (eliminate (A) and (D)).
One hundred plants were studied, and we expect three-fourths of them to be yellow (75 plants) and one-fourth
of them to be green (25 plants). Next, we compare expected (E) and observed (O) data and calculate an χ2
value.

Because two possibilities are being compared (green and yellow), the degrees of freedom in this test = 2 – 1 =
1. Using p = 0.05, you can determine the critical value to be 3.84 (which you don’t need to look up because it
is listed in all answer choices). Since χ2 > CV, you reject H0. The observed data does not match the expected
data, and the correct answer is (C).
