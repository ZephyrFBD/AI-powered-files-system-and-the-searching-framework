Both viewpoints are legitimate according to the relativity principle. [There is no
third point of view that will tell us which one is “really” moving.]

FIGURE 26–4 Observers 
and 
on two different trains (two different
reference frames), are moving with
relative speed v. (a) 
says that 
is moving to the right. (b) 
says
that 
is moving to the left. Both
viewpoints are legitimate: it all
depends on your reference frame.

Now suppose that observers 
and 
observe and measure two lightning
strikes. The lightning bolts mark both trains where they strike: at 
and 
on
train, and at 
and 
on 
train, Fig. 26–5a. For simplicity, we assume that
is exactly halfway between 
and 
and 
is halfway between

Let us first put ourselves in 
reference frame, so we observe 
moving to the
right with speed v. Let us also assume that the two events occur simultaneously in
frame, and just at the instant when 
and 
are opposite ea
