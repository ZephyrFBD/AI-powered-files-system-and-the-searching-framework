proteins, which leads to varied dysfunction of the organs. (credit: modification of work by Mikael Häggström)
Autoimmunity can develop with time, and its causes may be rooted in molecular mimicry. Antibodies and TCRs may bind
self antigens that are structurally similar to pathogen antigens, which the immune receptors first raised. As an example,

infection with Streptococcus pyogenes (bacterium that causes strep throat) may generate antibodies or T cells that react
with heart muscle, which has a similar structure to the surface of S. pyogenes. These antibodies can damage heart muscle
with autoimmune attacks, leading to rheumatic fever. Insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetes mellitus arises from a destructive
inflammatory TH1 response against insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. Patients with this
