(A) 
Incorrect. The bonds between nitrogenous base pairs are weak hydrogen 
bonds, not strong covalent bonds.
(B) 
Correct. Hydrogen bonds, like those found between nitrogenous base 
pairs, are weaker than covalent bonds and are easily broken by UV 
radiation.
(C) 
Incorrect. The covalent bonds between sugar-phosphate backbone 
molecules are strong and not easily broken by UV radiation.
(D) 
Incorrect. The bonds between sugar-phosphate backbone molecules are 
strong covalent bonds, not weak hydrogen bonds, and are therefore not 
easily broken by UV radiation.
