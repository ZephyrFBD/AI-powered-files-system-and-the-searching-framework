 19.98  Acetic acid can be manufactured by combining metha-
nol with carbon monoxide, an example of a carbonylation 
reaction:
CH3OH1l2 + CO1g2 ¡ CH3COOH1l2
(a) Calculate the equilibrium constant for the reaction at 
25 °C. (b) Industrially, this reaction is run at temperatures 
above 25 °C. Will an increase in temperature produce an 
increase or decrease in the mole fraction of acetic acid at 
equilibrium? Why are elevated temperatures used? (c) At 
what temperature will this reaction have an equilibrium 
constant equal to 1? (You may assume that ∆H° and ∆S° are 
temperature independent, and you may ignore any phase 
changes that might occur.)
