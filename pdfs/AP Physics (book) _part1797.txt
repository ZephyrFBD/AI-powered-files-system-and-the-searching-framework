CHAPTER 16
Electric Charge and Electric Field
There are two kinds of electric charge, positive and negative.
These designations are to be taken algebraically—that is, any
charge is plus or minus so many coulombs (C), in SI units.
Electric charge is conserved: if a certain amount of one type
of charge is produced in a process, an equal amount of the oppo-
site type is also produced; thus the net charge produced is zero.
According to atomic theory, electricity originates in the
atom, w
