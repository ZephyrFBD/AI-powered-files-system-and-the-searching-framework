each other.
We check the balanced equation by counting atoms and charges (Step 5). There are 
16 H, 2 Mn, 28 O, 10 C, and a net charge of 4+ on each side of the equation, confirming 
that the equation is correctly balanced.
Give It Some Thought
Do free electrons appear anywhere in the balanced equation for a redox reaction?
Complete and balance this equation by the method of half-reactions:
Cr2O7
2-1aq2 + Cl-1aq2 ¡ Cr3+1aq2 + Cl21g2 1acidic solution2
Solve
Step 1: We divide the equation into two half- 
reactions:
Analyze We are given an incomplete, unbalanced (skeleton) equa-
tion for a redox reaction occurring in acidic solution and asked to 
complete and balance it.
Plan We use the half-reaction procedure we just learned.
Cr2O7
2-1aq2 ¡ Cr3+1aq2
Cl-1aq2 ¡ Cl21g2
14 H+1aq2 + Cr2O7
2-1aq2 ¡ 2 Cr3+1aq2 + 7 H2O1l2
