e output
is electric energy. The various means to turn the turbine are shown in Table 15–4,
along with some of the advantages and disadvantages of each. Even nuclear power
plants use a steam engine, run on nuclear fuel. Electricity produced by falling water
at dams, by windmills, or by solar cells (Fig. 15–20b) does not involve a heat
engine.
The heat output 
from every heat engine, from power plants to cars, is
referred to as thermal pollution because this heat 
must be absorbed by the
environment—such as by water from rivers or lakes, or by the air using large cooling
towers (Fig. 15–20c). When water is the coolant, this heat raises the temperature of
the water before returning it to its source, altering the natural ecology of aquatic life
(largely because warmer water holds less oxygen). In the case of air cooling towers,
the output heat 
raises the temperature of the atmosphere, which affects
weather.
Air pollution—by which we mean the chemicals released in the burning of fossil
