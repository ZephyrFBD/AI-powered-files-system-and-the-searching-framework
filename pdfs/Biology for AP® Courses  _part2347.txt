nt, penetration, replication, assembly, and release. Viruses are host-specific
because they only can attach to and infect cells of certain organisms. Cells that a virus may use to replicate are called
permissive. The virus attacks the host cell by first attaching to a specific receptor site on the membrane of the host cell.
Next, the viral nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA, enters the host cell, either naked, leaving the protein capsid behind, or with
the capsid. If the capsid enters the cell, an additional uncoating step is needed. Viral nucleic acid then becomes available for
replication and transcription. The last stage of viral replication is the release of the new virions produced by the host that are
able to infect other cells. Depending on the type of virus, the replication cycle facilitates the transfer of genetic information
through the lytic and lysogenic cycles.
Bacteriophages, such as T4 are viruses that infect bacterial cells, can enter both the lytic and lysogenic cycles. A
