r substances in their standard states are known as standard molar 
entropies and denoted S°. The standard state for any substance is defined as the pure 
substance at 1 atm pressure.* Table 19.1 lists the values of S° for a number of substances at 
298 K; Appendix C gives a more extensive list.
We can make several observations about the S° values in Table 19.1:
1. Unlike enthalpies of formation, standard molar entropies of elements at the refer-
ence temperature of 298 K are not zero.
2. The standard molar entropies of gases are greater than those of liquids and solids, 
consistent with our interpretation of experimental observations, as represented in 
Figure 19.12.
3. Standard molar entropies generally increase with increasing molar mass.
4. Standard molar entropies generally increase with an increasing number of atoms in 
the formula of a substance.
Point 4 is related to the molecular motion discussed in Section 19.3. In general, as 
the number of atoms increases, the number of poss
