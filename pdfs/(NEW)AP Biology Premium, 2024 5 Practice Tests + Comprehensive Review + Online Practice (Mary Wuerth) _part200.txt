 independent and dependent variables in the
experiment.
(c) The following figure graphs the rate of photosynthesis (as measured by oxygen production) in control
plants and in plants with the mutation described in part (b).
Calculate the rate of photosynthesis in both sets of plants during the first 30 minutes of the experiment.
(d) Plants that use carotenoids as their primary photosynthetic pigment are grown under three different
wavelengths of light: 450 nm, 500 nm, and 550 nm. Predict which group of plants will perform the least
amount of photosynthesis, and justify your prediction.
Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (B) In prokaryotes, the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis occur on infoldings of the plasma
membrane. Choice (A) is incorrect because prokaryotes do not have chloroplasts, so they do not have a
thylakoid membrane. The light-dependent reactions require a membrane so that a proton gradient may be
formed; no gradient can be formed in the liquid cytosol, so cho
