Visualizing Concepts
12.1  Two solids are shown below. One is a semiconductor and 
one is an insulator. Which one is which? Explain your rea-
soning. [Sections 12.1, 12.7]
12.2  For each of the two-dimensional structures shown here 
(a) draw the unit cell, (b) determine the type of two-
dimensional lattice (from Figure 12.4), and (c) determine 
how many of each type of circle (white or black) there are 
per unit cell. [Section 12.2]

processes refers to the ductility of metals and which refers 
to malleability of metals? [Section 12.3]
