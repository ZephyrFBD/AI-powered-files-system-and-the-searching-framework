object with distant object blurry, and

Camera focus. How far must a 50.0-mm-focal-length 
camera lens be moved from its infinity setting to sharply focus an object 3.00 m
away?
APPROACH For an object at infinity, the image is at the focal point, by definition
(Section 23–7). For an object distance of 3.00 m, we use the thin lens equation,
Eq. 23–8, to find the image distance (distance of lens to film or sensor).
SOLUTION When focused at infinity, the lens is 50.0 mm from the film. When
focused at
the image distance is given by the lens equation,
We solve for 
and find
so the lens needs to move 0.8 mm away
from the film or digital sensor.
EXERCISE A If the lens of Example 25–1 is 50.4 mm from the film or sensor, what is the
object distance for sharp focus?
