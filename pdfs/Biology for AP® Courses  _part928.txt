rom the visible
light spectrum and reflect green. The carotenoid pigments absorb violet-blue-green light and reflect yellow-to-orange
light. Environmental factors such as day length and temperature influence which pigments predominant at certain times
of the year. Although the two photosystems run simultaneously, it is easier to explore them separately. Letâ€™s begin with
photosystem II.
A photon of light strikes the antenna pigments of PS II to initiate photosynthesis. In the noncyclic pathway, PS II captures
photons at a slightly higher energy level than PS I. (Remember that shorter wavelengths of light carry more energy.) The
absorbed energy travels to the reaction center of the antenna pigment that contains chlorophyll a and boosts chlorophyll a
electrons to a higher energy level. The electrons are accepted by a primary electron acceptor protein and then pass to the
electron transport chain also embedded in the thylakoid membrane. The energy absorbed in PS II is enough to oxidize (sp
