 mRNA transcript forms
only a weak interaction with the template DNA. This, coupled with the stalled polymerase, induces enough instability for
the core enzyme to break away and liberate the new mRNA transcript.

Upon termination, the process of transcription is complete. By the time termination occurs, the prokaryotic transcript would
already have been used to begin synthesis of numerous copies of the encoded protein because these processes can occur
concurrently. The unification of transcription, translation, and even mRNA degradation is possible because all of these
processes occur in the same 5' to 3' direction, and because there is no membranous compartmentalization in the prokaryotic
cell (Figure 15.9). In contrast, the presence of a nucleus in eukaryotic cells precludes simultaneous transcription and
translation.
