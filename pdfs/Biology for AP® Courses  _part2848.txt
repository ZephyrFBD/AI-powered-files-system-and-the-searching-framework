Animals must be able to maintain homeostasis—the ability to maintain dynamic equilibrium around a set point—while also
being able to respond to changing conditions. For example, as an endotherm, your body temperature remains fairly constant
around 37◦C or 98.6◦F. If your temperature climbs above the set point, you sweat to cool off; if your temperature drops
below the set point, you shiver to warm up. Your blood glucose levels also remain fairly constant because the liver removes
glucose from the blood and converts it to glycogen; when
