salt. Inadequate iodine intake, which occurs in many developing countries, results in an inability to synthesize T3 and T4
hormones. The thyroid gland enlarges in a condition called goiter, which is caused by overproduction of TSH without the
formation of thyroid hormone. Thyroglobulin is contained in a fluid called colloid, and TSH stimulation results in higher
levels of colloid accumulation in the thyroid. In the absence of iodine, this is not converted to thyroid hormone, and colloid
begins to accumulate more and more in the thyroid gland, leading to goiter.
Disorders can arise from both the underproduction and overproduction of thyroid hormones. Hypothyroidism,
underproduction of the thyroid hormones, can cause a low metabolic rate leading to weight gain, sensitivity to
