Which of the following predicts what will happen in the continued
presence of the antibodies?
Ca++ ions will flood into the motor neuron ending, increasing
the release of more ACh.
The amount of neurotransmitter being released will decrease.
The number of action potentials in the motor neuron will
decrease.
The antibodies will destroy the postsynaptic receptors, and the
muscle response will diminish.
