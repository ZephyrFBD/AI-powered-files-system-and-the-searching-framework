le of water per bond, so 14 molecules of water would
be needed. Choices (A) and (B) are incorrect because dehydration reactions form bonds, not break them. Choice
(C) is incorrect because only 14 water molecules would be needed, not 15, and those water molecules would be
consumed, not produced.
8. (B) Secondary structure in proteins is formed by hydrogen bonds between the amino acids in the polypeptide
chain. Choice (A) is incorrect because primary structure is held together by peptide bonds. Tertiary structure is
driven primarily by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions and is not formed by peptide bonds, so choice (C)
is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because quaternary structure is only found in proteins that are composed of
more than one subunit.
9. (A) Solutions with lower solute concentrations have higher water potentials; side A initially has a lower solute
concentration, so it has a higher water potential. Choice (B) is incorrect because solutions with higher solute
conc
