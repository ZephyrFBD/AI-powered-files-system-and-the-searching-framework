rbitals, it is a simple matter to deter-
mine the electron configurations for the diatomic molecules B2 through Ne2. For exam-
ple, a boron atom has three valence electrons. (Remember that we are ignoring the core 
1s electrons.) Thus, for B2 we must place six electrons in MOs. Four of them fill the s
2s 
and s
2s
* MOs, leading to no net bonding. The fifth electron goes in one p
2p MO, and the 
sixth goes in the other p
2p MO, with the two electrons having the same spin. Therefore, 
B2 has a bond order of 1.
Each time we move one element to the right in period 2, two more electrons must 
be placed in the diagram of Figure 9.41. For example, on moving to C2, we have two 
more electrons than in B2, and these electrons are placed in the p
2p MOs, completely 
filling them. The electron configurations and bond orders for B2 through Ne2 are given 
in Figure 9.43.
