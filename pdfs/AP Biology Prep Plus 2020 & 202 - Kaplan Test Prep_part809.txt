4. Which of the following best describes the eï¬€ects, in terms of
energy and matter flow and cycling, when plants are fertilized
with nitrogen-rich fertilizer?
Plants take up energy from the fertilizer, which can be
recycled. Nitrogen is consumed during plant metabolism.
(A)
Plants obtain energy from the Sun, which flows to primary
consumers. Nitrogen in fertilizer is used by plants to make
organic molecules that can be recycled through the nitrogen
cycle.
(B)
Plants take up energy from fertilizer, which is eventually lost
as heat. Nitrogen in fertilizer is used to make organic
molecules that can be recycled through the nitrogen cycle.
(C)
Plants obtain energy from the Sun and lose it again as heat.
Nitrogen fertilizer slows this process, allowing the plants to
conserve more energy.
