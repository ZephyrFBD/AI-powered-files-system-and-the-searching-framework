b.
An environment rich in limestone would be more affected by acid rain.
c.

d.
The impact would depend on the type of vegetation present.
2.3 | Carbon
In this section, you will investigate the following questions:
•
Why is carbon important for life?
•
How do functional groups determine the properties of biological molecules?
Connection for AP® Courses
The unique properties of carbon make it a central part of biological molecules. With four valence electrons, carbon can
covalently bond to oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen to form the many molecules important for cellular function. Carbon
