same receptor. Thus, the signal is transmitted from outside the cell to the
cytoplasm. Once inside the cell, the signal is carried by a second
messenger. The most common second messenger is cyclic AMP (cAMP).
Notice that the first messenger, the signaling molecule or ligand, never
enters the cell. Cell surface receptors are so prevalent that they make up
about 30% of all human proteins.
Three types of cell surface receptors are ion channel receptors, G
protein–coupled receptors, and protein kinase receptors.
Ion-channel receptors are allosteric receptors that open and shut a
gate in a membrane, allowing an influx of ions, such as Na+, K+,
Ca2+, or Cl– ions. These ion-channel receptors and ion-gated
channels are the basis of normal nerve functio
