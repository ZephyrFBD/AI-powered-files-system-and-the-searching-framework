f the bond dipole 
of the O¬H bonds. (Note: You will need to use vector 
addition to do this.) (c) Compare your answer from part (b) 
to the dipole moments of the hydrogen halides (Table 8.3). 
Is your answer in accord with the relative electronegativity 
of oxygen?

(a) Predict the electron-domain geometry around the cen-
tral Xe atom in XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6. (b) The molecule IF7
has a pentagonal bipyramid structure: five fluorines are 
equatorial, forming a flat pentagon around the central io-
dine atom, and the other two fluorines are axial. Predict 
the molecular geometry of IF6
