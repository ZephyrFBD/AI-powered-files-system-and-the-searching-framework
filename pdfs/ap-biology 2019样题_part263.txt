 investigations. 
Ask them to support their 
conclusions with data by having 
each student or group of 
students add a sentence to the 
conclusion. Once the conclusion 
is complete, read it (or show it on 
a screen), and then facilitate a 
class discussion.
Debate
Engaging in an informal or 
formal argumentation of 
an issue.
Gives students an 
opportunity to collect and 
orally present evidence 
supporting the affirmative 
and negative arguments of 
a proposition or issue.
Students can debate which 
line of evidence provides the 
strongest support for evolution. 
Error Analysis
Students analyze an 
existing solution to 
determine whether 
(or where) errors 
have occurred.
Allows students to 
troubleshoot errors and 
focus on solutions that may 
arise when they perform 
the same procedures 
themselves.
Have students analyze their 
work to determine where there 
were errors in their calculations. 
For example, this can be done 
as part of the diffusion and 
osmosis lab, or when teaching
