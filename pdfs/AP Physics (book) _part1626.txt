FIGURE 15–11 Schematic diagram
of energy transfers for a heat engine.
In a reciprocating engine, Fig. 15–12a, the heated steam passes through the intake
valve and expands against a piston, forcing it to move. As the piston returns to 
its original position, it forces the gases out the exhaust valve which opens. A steam
turbine, Fig.15–12b, is very similar except that the reciprocating piston is replaced by
a rotating turbine that resembles a paddlewheel with many sets of blades. Most of
our electricity today is generated using steam turbines.† The material that is heated
and cooled, steam in this case, is called the working substance. In an old-time steam
engine (see page 412), the high temperature is obtained by burning coal, oil, or other
fuel to heat the steam.
In an internal combustion engine (used in most automobiles), the high tem-
perature is achieved by burning the gasoline–air mixture in the cylinder itself
(ignited by the spark plug), as described in Fig. 15–13.
