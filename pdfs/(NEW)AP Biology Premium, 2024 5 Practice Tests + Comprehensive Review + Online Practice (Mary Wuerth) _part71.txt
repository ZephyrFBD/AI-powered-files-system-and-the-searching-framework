tion of H+ ions
in a solution, and bases increase the relative concentration of OH– ions in a solution.
Biological systems can be very sensitive to changes in pH. Buffers are crucial in maintaining relatively constant
pH levels in living cells. Buffers can form acids or bases in response to changing pH levels in a cell. An example of
this is the carbonic acid–bicarbonate buffering system in blood plasma. The carbon dioxide that is produced by
cellular respiration reacts with water in blood plasma to produce carbonic acid (H2CO3). Carbonic acid can
dissociate into bicarbonate ions (HCO3
–) and hydrogen ions, as shown in the following equation:
If the pH of a cell becomes too low (excess H+), the reaction will shift to the left, allowing the basic bicarbonate
ions to neutralize the excess H+ ions, returning the pH to normal levels. When the pH of a cell becomes too high
(excess OH–), the reaction shifts to the right, adding more H+ ions to the cell that can neutralize the excess OH–,
