rsus “- plasmid” nontransformed cells? 
2. Which of the traits that you originally observed for E. coli did not seem to become 
altered? Which traits seem now to be significantly different after performing the 
transformation procedure? 
3. What evidence suggests that the changes were due to the transformation procedures 
you performed? 
4. What advantage would there be for an organism to be able to turn on or off  
particular genes in response to certain conditions?  
5. Was your attempt at performing a genetic transformation successful? If so, how 
successful? 
By calculating transformation efficiency, you can measure the success of your  
transformation quantitatively.  
■ Calculating Transformation Efficiency 
Your next task is to learn how to determine the extent to which you genetically 
transformed E. coli cells. This quantitative measurement is referred to as the 
transformation efficiency. What is the importance of quantifying how many cells have 
been transformed? In many app
