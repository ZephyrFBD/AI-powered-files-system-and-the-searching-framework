of the plasma membrane as we now understand them. The
fluid mosaic model describes the structure of the plasma membrane as a mosaic of components—including phospholipids,
cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates—that gives the membrane a fluid character. Plasma membranes range from 5 to
10 nm in thickness. For comparison, human red blood cells, visible via light microscopy, are approximately 8 µm wide, or
approximately 1,000 times wider than a plasma membrane. The membrane does look a bit like a sandwich (Figure 5.2).
Figure 5.2 The fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane describes the plasma membrane as a fluid combination of
phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins. Carbohydrates attached to lipids (glycolipids) and to proteins (glycoproteins)
extend from the outward-facing surface of the membrane.
The principal components of a plasma membrane are lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol), proteins, and carbohydrates
