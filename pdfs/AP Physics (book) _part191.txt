ese two points on 
the graph. A straight line drawn from point 
to point 
forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose sides are 
and 
The 
ratio 
is the slope of the straight line 
But 
is also the 
average velocity of the object during the time interval 
Therefore,
we conclude that the average velocity of an object during any time interval
is equal to the slope of the straight line (or chord) connecting the two
points 
and 
on an x vs.
graph.
Consider now a time intermediate between 
and 
call it 
at which moment
the object is at 
(Fig. 2–28). The slope of the straight line 
is less than the slope
of 
. Thus the average velocity during the time interval 
is less than
during the time interval t2 - t1 .
