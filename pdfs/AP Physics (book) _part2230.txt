20–9 Torque on a Current Loop;
Magnetic Moment
When an electric current flows in a closed loop of wire placed in an external
magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 20–34, the magnetic force on the current can
produce a torque. This is the principle behind a number of important practical
devices, including motors and analog voltmeters and ammeters, which we discuss
in the next Section.
Current flows through the rectangular loop in Fig. 20–34a, whose face we
assume is parallel to 
.
exerts no force and no torque on the horizontal
segments of wire because they are para
