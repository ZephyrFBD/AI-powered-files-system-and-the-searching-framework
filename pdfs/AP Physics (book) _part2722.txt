The wave theory of light is strongly supported by observations
that light exhibits interference and diffraction. Wave theory also
explains the refraction of light and the fact that light travels more
slowly in transparent solids and liquids than it does in air.
[*An aid to predicting wave behavior is Huygens’ principle,
which states that every point on a wave front can be considered
as a source of tiny wavelets that spread out in the forward
direction at the speed of the wave itself. The new wave front is
the envelope (the common tangent) of all the wavelets.]
The wavelength of light in a medium with index of refrac-
tion n is
(24;1)
where 
is the wavelength in vacuum; the frequency is not
changed.
