r valence electrons. There are six electrons in the cyanide 
triple bond and two nonbonding electrons on C. We calculate the formal charge on C as 
4 - 1
2162 - 2 = -1. For N, the valence electron count is five; there are six electrons in the 
cyanide triple bond, and two nonbonding electrons on the N. The formal charge on N is 
5 - 1
2162 - 2 = 0. We can draw the whole ion with its formal charges as

Notice that the sum of the formal charges equals the overall charge on the ion, 1-. 
The formal charges on a neutral molecule must add to zero, whereas those on an ion add 
to give the charge on the ion.

CHAPTER 8 Basic Concepts of Chemical Bonding
If we can draw several Lewis structures for a molecule, the concept of formal charge 
can help us decide which is the most important, which we shall call the dominant Lewis 
structure. One Lewis structure for CO2, for instance, has two double bonds. However, we 
can also satisfy the octet rule by drawing a Lewis structure hav
