ing and antibonding orbital energies, or (2) the horizontal separa-
tion between the elements increases, which leads to an increase in 
the electronegativity difference and bond polarity.
Plan We must look at the periodic table and compare the relative 
positions of the elements in each case.
Solve Gallium is in the fourth period and group 3A. Phosphorus is 
in the third period and group 5A. Zinc and sulfur are in the same 
periods as gallium and phosphorus, respectively. However, zinc, in 
group 2B, is one element to the left of gallium; sulfur in group 6A 
is one element to the right of phosphorus. Thus, we would expect 
the electronegativity difference to be larger for ZnS, which should 
result in ZnS having a larger band gap than GaP
.
For both GaP and GaN the more electropositive element is 
gallium. So we need only compare the positions of the more 
electronegative elements, P and N. Nitrogen is located above phos-
phorus in group 5A. Therefore, based on increased orbital overl
