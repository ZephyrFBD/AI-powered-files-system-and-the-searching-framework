e objective lens (focal length 
) and forms a real image 
of the distant
object in the plane of its focal point 
(or near it if the object is not at infinity).
The second lens, called the eyepiece (focal length ), acts as a magnifier. That is,
the eyepiece magnifies the image 
formed by the objective lens to produce
a second, greatly magnified image,
which is virtual and inverted. If the view-
ing eye is relaxed, the eyepiece is adjusted so the image 
is at infinity. Then the
real image 
is at the focal point 
of the eyepiece, and the distance between the
lenses is
for an object at infinity.
To find the total angular magnification of this telescope, we note that the
angle an object subtends as viewed by the unaided eye is just the angle 
sub-
tended at the telescope objective. From Fig. 25–20 we can see that
