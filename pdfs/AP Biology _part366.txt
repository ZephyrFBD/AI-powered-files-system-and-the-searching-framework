ow to use the genetic code
shown on page 177 to determine what polypeptide would form
from a particular mRNA sequence.
Focus on regulation of gene expression. Gene expression can be
altered before transcription (by altering chromatin structure or by
methylating DNA), during transcription (how, in an operon, RNA
polymerase binds to or is blocked from binding to a promoter), or
after transcription (by alternate RNA slicing and RNA
processing).
Understand tools and techniques of biotechnology and how you
would employ them to do an experiment or solve a problem. For
example, you are shown an image of an electrophoresis gel
containing bands of DNA from a child and from a man whom the
child’s mother claims is the child’s biological father. Can you
determine if the man is the father by comparing the two sets of
bands? Can you also explain why your answer is correct?
