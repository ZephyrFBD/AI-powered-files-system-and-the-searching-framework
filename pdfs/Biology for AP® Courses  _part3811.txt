Explain the three-step process by which the kidneys filter blood.
a.
First, the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the glomerulus, which filters out
almost all solutes, except for proteins, by glomerular filtration. Second, the filtrate is collected in the renal
tubules. Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule by tubular secretion. Third,
additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the tubules of the kidney during tubular reabsorption.
