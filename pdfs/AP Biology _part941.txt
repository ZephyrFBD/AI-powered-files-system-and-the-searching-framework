s an example of negative feedback.
(D) Modification of histone proteins, as in methylation, silences
genes. Epigenetics refers to the expression of a trait due to non-DNA
factors. Pseudogenes and introns are not expressed.
(C) All the other choices refer to the light-independent reactions.
(C) According to the data, an animal with a large body mass
expends less energy per kilogram of body mass, regardless of the
type of locomotion. You can conclude that because the lines for
“Flying,” “Swimming,” and “Running” all slope downward and to
the right. Swimming is the most energy efficient mode of
locomotion, whereas running is the least energy efficient mode of
locomotion. You can conclude this because the “Swimming” line is
placed lowest on the graph, whereas the “Running” line is above the
other lines on the graph. Choice A is incorrect because it is a false
statement given the data. Choice B is incorrect because the swimmer
is supported by the water. Choice D is incorrect because the bes
