 For example, the difference between the enthalpies 
of the C ¬C bond and the C “C bond is about 270 kJ>mol 
 (Table 8.3); this 
large value reﬂects the “strength” of a carbon–carbon p bond. On the other hand, 
the difference between Si¬Si and Si “Si bonds is only about 100 kJ/mol, signiﬁ-
cantly lower than that for carbon, reﬂecting much weaker p bonding.
As we shall see, p bonds are particularly important in the chemistry of carbon, 
nitrogen, and oxygen, each the first member in its group. The heavier elements in these 
groups have a tendency to form only single bonds.

The ready ability of period 2 elements to form p bonds is an important factor in 
determining the elemental forms of these elements. Compare, for example, carbon 
and silicon. Carbon has five major crystalline allotropes: diamond, graphite, buckmin-
sterfullerene, graphene, and carbon nanotubes.
