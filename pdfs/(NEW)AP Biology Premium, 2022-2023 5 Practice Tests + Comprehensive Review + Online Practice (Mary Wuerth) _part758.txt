(c) The number of krill would decrease.

(a) Juxtacrine signaling involves direct contact between cells.
(b) Cytokines function as signaling molecules or ligands.
(c)
(d) Secondary messengers amplify a response in a cell by triggering multiple chemical reactions through the
process of signal amplification.
