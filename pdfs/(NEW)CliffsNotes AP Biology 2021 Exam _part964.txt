the plotted curve between 0 and 2 seconds. Since the plot is a straight line over
this interval, the rate of the reaction is constant and the slope at any point along this portion of the line will provide
the rate. For the entire interval from 0 to 2 seconds, the slope, determined by the change in product formed divided
by the
change in time, is
 
.
 
4. Answer: 1.6 (acceptable range: 1.5-1.6)
 
The energy taken in by producers is 20,950 kcal and that taken in by carnivores is 328 kcal. The fraction of
carnivores obtained from producers is
 
. Converted to a percent, 0.0157 × 100 =
1.6%.
5. Answer: 273
The question gives the allele frequency of the recessive (white) allele, so q = 0.3. Since the population is in Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium, p + q = 1 or
 
p = 1 − q = 1 − 0.3 = 0.7
 
Then, the frequency of the white individuals is q2, or 0.09, and the frequency of remaining black individuals must be
1 − 0.09 = 0.91. (The
frequency of the black individuals can also be calculated from p2
