57. Substances that are formed as intermediates or products during a
biochemical reaction are called “metabolites.” Certain drugs,
called “antimetabolites,” possess chemical similarities that allow
them to mimic metabolites and participate in normal biochemical
reactions, but are diﬀerent enough that they interfere with overall
cellular function. These drugs are commonly used as antibacterial
or anticancer agents. Which of the following statements oﬀers the
most plausible explanation of how these drugs work?
The antimetabolite binds to the active site of an enzyme and
directly inhibits it, acting as a competitive inhibitor.
(A)
The antimetabolite binds to the active site of an enzyme,
allowing the reaction to pro
