 cubic structure shown in Fig-
ure 12.17. The length of the cubic unit cell edge is 3.53 Å 
for nickel and 3.56 Å for Ni3Al. Use these data to calculate 
and compare the densities of these two materials.

The karat scale used to describe gold alloys is based on 
mass percentages. (a) If an alloy is formed that is 50 mol% 
silver and 50 mol% gold, what is the karat number of the 
alloy? Use Figure 12.18 to estimate the color of this alloy. 
(b) If an alloy is formed that is 50 mol% copper and 50 
mol% gold, what is the karat number of the alloy? What is 
the color of this alloy?

Spinel is a mineral that contains 37.9% Al, 17.1% Mg, and 
45.0% O, by mass, and has a density of 3.57 g>cm3. The 
unit cell is cubic with an edge length of 8.09 Å. How many 
atoms of each typ
