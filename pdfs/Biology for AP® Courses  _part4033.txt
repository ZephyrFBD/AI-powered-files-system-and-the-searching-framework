ater flees, rotifers, aphids, stick insects, some ants, wasps, and bees. Bees
and wasps use parthenogenesis to produce haploid males (called drones). If an egg is fertilized, it develops as a diploid
female.
Some vertebrate animals—such as certain reptiles, amphibians, and fish—also reproduce through parthenogenesis.
Although more common in plants, parthenogenesis has been observed in animal species that were segregated by sex
in terrestrial or marine zoos. Two female Komodo dragons, a hammerhead shark, and a blacktop shark have produced
parthenogenic young when the females have been isolated from males.
Sexual Reproduction
Sexual reproduction is the combination of (usually haploid) reproductive cells from two individuals to form a third (usually
diploid) unique offspring. Sexual reproduction produces offspring with novel combinations of genes. This can be an
adaptive advantage in unstable or unpredictable environments. As humans, we are used to thinking of animals as having two
