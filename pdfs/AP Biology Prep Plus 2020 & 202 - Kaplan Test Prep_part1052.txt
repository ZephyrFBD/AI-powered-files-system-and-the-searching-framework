20 amino acids in proteins, so the Murchison meteorite
must be missing at least one of the amino acids found in proteins. That said, it is not
reasonable to conclude that if meteorites did not provide all the necessary amino acids,
then they did not provide any of the amino acids. (C) is incorrect because the presence of
amino acid and nucleotide monomers does not guarantee the presence of more complex
polymers such as proteins and nucleic acids.

The data here suggest that the cecum is significantly longer in species that consume
plant matter for their diets (1 and 4) compared to those that consume at least some meat
(2 and 3). Of the statements listed, the only one that logically follows is (A): in organisms
that eat meat, the cecum becomes unnecessary, and starts to shorten. (B) is the opposite
of what would be expected, since diets that contain meat tend to be richer in proteins
than those that are exclusively plant-based. The data on cecum length and diet are
insuﬀicient to d
