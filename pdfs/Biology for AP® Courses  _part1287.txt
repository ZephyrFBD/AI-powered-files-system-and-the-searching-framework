 he allowed them to self-fertilize naturally. He then collected and grew the seeds from the F1
plants to produce the F2, or second filial, generation. Mendel’s experiments extended beyond the F2 generation to the F3 and
F4 generations, and so on, but it was the ratio of characteristics in the P0−F1−F2 generations that were the most intriguing
and became the basis for Mendel’s postulates.

Figure 12.3 In one of his experiments on inheritance patterns, Mendel crossed plants that were true-breeding for
violet flower color with plants true-breeding for white flower color (the P generation). The resulting hybrids in the F1
generation all had violet flowers. In the F2 generation, approximately three quarters of the plants had violet flowers,
and one quarter had white flowers.
