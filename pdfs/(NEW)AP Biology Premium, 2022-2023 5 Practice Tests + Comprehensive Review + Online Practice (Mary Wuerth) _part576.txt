The students record this data and use a spreadsheet to
calculate the mean and the standard error of the mean of the data. When the plants flower, students cross-pollinate
only the plants that ranked in the top 10% of the number of trichomes per leaf measurement that was taken on day
11. These plants then develop seeds, and the seeds are harvested. These seeds are planted (to create the F1
generation) and grown to day 11 of their life cycle, at which time the students count the number of trichomes per
leaf. The students record this data in a spreadsheet, which calculates the mean and the standard error of the mean of
the data set. The number of trichomes per leaf on day 11 from both the parental generation and the F1 generation are
plotted on a bar graph, which includes 95% confidence intervals, as shown in Figure 24.2.

If the 95% confidence intervals of the parental generation and the F1 generation do not overlap, it i
