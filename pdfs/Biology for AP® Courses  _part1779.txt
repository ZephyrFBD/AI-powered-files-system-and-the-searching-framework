ruited to a specific sequence on the promoter of a specific gene.
There are hundreds of transcription factors in a cell that each bind specifically to a particular DNA sequence motif. When
transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene, it is referred to as a cis-acting element, because
it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene. The region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the
transcription factor binding site. Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find
their binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed.
Enhancers and Transcription
In some eukaryotic genes, there are regions that help increase or enhance transcription. These regions, called enhancers,
