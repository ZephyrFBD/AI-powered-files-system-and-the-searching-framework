es necessary for the
Golgi complex to function. The Golgi complex controls the modification and packaging of proteins for transport.
Proteins made on the free ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum are sent to the Golgi, which modifies the
proteins into their final conformation and packages the finished proteins into vesicles for transport throughout the
cell. The Golgi complex is often found near the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Lysosomes are membrane-bound sacs, containing hydrolytic enzymes, that function in a variety of cell
processes. Lysosomes can help digest macromolecules, break down worn-out cell parts, function in apoptosis, or
destroy bacteria and viruses that have entered the cell. (See Figure 5.5.)

Another membrane-bound sac in eukaryotic cells is the vacuole, as shown in Figure 5.6. Vacuoles function in
food or water storage, water regulation in a cell, or waste storage until the waste can be eliminated from the cell. In
