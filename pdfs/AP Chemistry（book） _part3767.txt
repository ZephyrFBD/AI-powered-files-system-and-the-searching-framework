ore likely to act as ligands? (a) Posi-
tively charged ions or negatively charged ions? (b) Neutral 
molecules that are polar or those that are nonpolar?
 23.23  A complex is written as NiBr2 # 6 NH3. (a) What is the oxi-
dation state of the Ni atom in this complex? (b) What is 
the likely coordination number for the complex? (c) If 
the complex is treated with excess AgNO3(aq), how many 
moles of AgBr will precipitate per mole of complex?
 23.24  Crystals of hydrated chromium(III) chloride are green, 
have an empirical formula of CrCl3 # 6 H2O, and are highly 
soluble, (a) Write the complex ion that exists in this com-
pound. (b) If the complex is treated with excess AgNO3(aq), 
how many moles of AgCl will precipitate per mole of 
CrCl3 # 6 H2O dissolved in solution? (c) Crystals of anhy-
drous chromium(III) chloride are violet and insoluble in 
aqueous solution. The coordination geometry of chro-
mium in these crystals is octahedral, as is almost always the 
case for Cr3+. How can th
