s begins the neuron's refractory period, in which it cannot produce another action potential
because its sodium channels will not open. At the same time, voltage-gated K+ channels open, allowing K+ to leave the cell.
As K+ ions leave the cell, the membrane potential once again becomes negative. The diffusion of K+ out of the cell actually
hyperpolarizes the cell, in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell's normal resting potential. At
this point, the sodium channels will return to their resting state, meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane
potential again exceeds the threshold potential. Eventually the extra K+ ions diffuse out of the cell through the potassium
leakage channels, bringing the cell from its hyperpolarized state, back to its resting membrane potential.
Figure 26.11 The formation of an action potential can be divided into five steps: (1) A stimulus from a sensory
cell or another neuron causes the target cell to depolarize toward the t
