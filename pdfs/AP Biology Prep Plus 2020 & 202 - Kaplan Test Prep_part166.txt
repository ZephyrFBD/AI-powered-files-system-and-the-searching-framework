sense cDNA is expressed. The group then followed the
accumulation of radioactive sucrose by yeast cells under several
conditions as summarized in the table. Sucrose is made of a
molecule of fructose linked to a molecule of glucose. Maltose is a
disaccharide made of two molecules of glucose. Raﬀinose is a
trisaccharide made of galactose, glucose, and fructose.
Chlorophenyl hydrazone is a metabolic poison that prevents
synthesis of ATP.
