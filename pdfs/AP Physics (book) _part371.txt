orce vectors like any other vectors as described in
Chapter 3. The first step is to choose an xy coordinate system (see Fig. 4–19a),
and then resolve vectors into their components.
SOLUTION The two force vectors are shown resolved into components in 
Fig. 4–19b. We add the forces using the method of components. The compo-
nents of 
are
The components of

is negative because it points along the negative y axis. The components of
the resultant force are (see Fig. 4–19c)
To find the magnitude of the resultant force, we use the Pythagorean theorem,
The only remaining question is the angle that the net force 
makes with the
x axis. We use:
and  
The net force on the boat has magnitude 53.3 N and
acts at an 11.0° angle to the x axis.
When solving problems involving Newton’s laws and force, it is very important
to draw a diagram showing all the forces acting on each object involved. Such a dia-
gram is called a free-body diagram, or force diagram: choose one object, and draw
an arrow to r
