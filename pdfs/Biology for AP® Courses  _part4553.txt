Researchers were interested in answering the question,
“How does sheep grazing affect the population densities of
wild mountain birds?” To answer this question, the
researchers counted population numbers of various birds
in areas of low intensity sheep grazing and in areas of high
intensity sheep grazing. A third set of data was collected
from control areas in which no sheep grazing occurred.
The results of this study are shown in these graphs. All of
the bird species eat insects as their primary source of
nutrition. The group labeled “insect eaters” combines
many species because the numbers for individual species
were too small to show separately as shown for the
meadow pipit and willow grouse, which are both highly
abundant. Because all of the birds are insect eaters,
construct a scientific question related to this fact that the
researchers could ask to refine their study even further.
