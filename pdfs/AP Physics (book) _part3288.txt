ight LED. White light can be approximated by LEDs in two ways:
(1) using a red, a yellow–green, and a blue LED; (2) using a blue LED with
coatings of “powders” or “phosphors” that are fluorescent (Section 28–10). For
the latter, the high-energy blue LED photons are themselves emitted, plus they
can excite the various phosphors to excited states which decay in two or more
steps, emitting light of lower energy and longer wavelengths. Figure 29–34 shows
typical spectra of both types.

FIGURE 29–34 (a) A combination of
three LEDs of three different colors
gives a sort of white color, but there
are large wavelength gaps, so some
colors would not be reflected and
would appear black; this type is 
rarely used now. (b) A blue LED with
fluorescent phosphors or powders
gives a better approximation of
