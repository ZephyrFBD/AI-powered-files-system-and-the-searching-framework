only used by scien-
tists. Whenever we first encounter a non–SI unit in the text, the SI unit will also be given. The 
relations between the non–SI and SI units we will use most frequently in this text appear on 
the back inside cover. We will discuss how to convert from one to the other in Section 1.7.
Give It Some Thought
How many mg are there in 1 mg?
Length and Mass
The SI base unit of length is the meter, a distance slightly longer than a yard. Mass* is a measure 
of the amount of material in an object. The SI base unit of mass is the kilogram (kg), which is 
equal to about 2.2 pounds (lb). This base unit is unusual because it uses a prefix, kilo-, instead of 
the word gram alone. We obtain other units for mass by adding prefixes to the word gram.
