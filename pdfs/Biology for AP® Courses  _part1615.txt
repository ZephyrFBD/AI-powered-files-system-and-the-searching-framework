Since the rediscovery of Mendel’s work in the 1900s, scientists have learned much about how the genetic blueprints stored
in DNA are capable of replication, expression, and mutation. Just as the 26 letters of the English alphabet can be arranged
into what seems to be a limitless number of words, with new ones added to the dictionary every year, the four nucleotides of
DNA—A, T, C, and G—can generate sequences of DNA called genes that specify tens of thousands of polymers of amino
acids. In turn, these sequences can be
