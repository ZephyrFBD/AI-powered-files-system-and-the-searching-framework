8. If you used 1000 J of energy to throw a ball, would it 
travel faster if you threw the ball (ignoring air resistance) 
(a) so that it was also rotating?
(b) so that it wasn’t rotating?
(c) It makes no difference.
9. A small solid sphere and a small thin hoop are rolling along
a horizontal surface with the same translational speed when
they encounter a 20° rising slope. If these two objects roll up
the slope without slipping,which will rise farther up the slope?
(a) The sphere.
(b) The hoop.
(c) Both the same.
(d) More information about the objects’ mass and
diameter is needed.
10. A small mass m on a string is rotating without friction in a

happens to the angular velocity of the object?
(a) It increases.
(b) It decreases.
(c) It remains the same.
