mmarized, presented, and tested for validity. This depends on what kind of question was being asked at the
beginning of the experiment. When you’re reading this chapter, pay attention to which techniques are used when.
On the AP Biology Exam, you should be able to justify which techniques are best.
Don’t forget to check out the formula sheet!
This list is a good reference for the types of quantitative questions you should be able to tackle. We will not walk
though all of these in detail, but you will find some examples in the end-of-chapter drills and in the practice tests.
Use the formula sheets to familiarize yourself with these concepts.
