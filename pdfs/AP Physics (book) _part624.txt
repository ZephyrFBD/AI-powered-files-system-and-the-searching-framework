. The spring, with spring 
stiffness constant  
and ignorable mass, is compressed 6.0 cm 
and released. If the dart detaches from the spring when the spring reaches its
natural length
what speed does the dart acquire?
APPROACH The dart is initially at rest (point 1), so
We ignore friction
and use conservation of mechanical energy; the only potential energy is elastic.
SOLUTION We use Eq. 6–14 with point 1 being at the maximum compression
of the spring, so  
(dart not yet released) and  
Point 2 we
choose to be the instant the dart flies off the end of the spring (Fig. 6–22b), so
and we want to find 
Thus Eq. 6–14 can be written
