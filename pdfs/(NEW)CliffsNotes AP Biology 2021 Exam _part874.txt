ies 4 and 5 share a common ancestor. The cladogram does not provide
information about ancestry, just information about relatedness.
11. D. For this, the logistic equation, early stages of growth are depicted by a rapid (logarithmic) rise in the
population size, followed by a gradual tapering off of the growth rate as the carrying capacity is approached. When
the population size reaches the carrying capacity, the net rate of growth is zero, as expressed by the horizontal line
(slope of the line is zero) of the plotted equation.
12. B. As the population size approaches the carrying capacity, the growth rate decreases and becomes zero when N
= K.
13. C. The net rate of growth is greatest early in the plotted equation, when N is still small compared to K. To see
this mathematically, rearrange the equation like this:
When N is small compared to K, the fraction
  is small compared to 1. Thus,
 
is approximately equal to 1, and the value of the equation is maximum and equal to rN.
