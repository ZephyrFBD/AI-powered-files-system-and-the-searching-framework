tains seven Fe atoms 
and one Mo atom, linked by sulfur atoms. 
The molecules on the outside of the cofactor 
connect it to the rest of the protein.
Formic acid (HCOOH) decomposes in the gas phase at elevated temperatures 
as follows:
HCOOH1g2 ยก CO21g2 + H21g2
The uncatalyzed decomposition reaction is determined to be first order. A 
graph of the partial pressure of HCOOH versus time for decomposition at  
838 K is shown as the red curve in Figure 14.30. When a small amount of 
solid ZnO is added to the reaction chamber, the partial pressure of acid versus 
time varies as shown by the blue curve in Figure 14.30.
(a) Estimate the half-life and first-order rate constant for formic acid 
decomposition.
(b) What can you conclude from the effect of added ZnO on the decomposi-
tion of formic acid?
(c) The progress of the reaction was followed by measuring the partial pres-
sure of formic acid vapor at selected times. Suppose that, instead, we had 
plotted the concentration of formic acid in
