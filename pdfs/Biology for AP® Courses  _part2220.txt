hinacea flower (Figure 20.1) could not look more different, yet they are related, as are all living
organisms on Earth. By following pathways of similarities and changes—both visible and genetic—scientists seek to map
the evolutionary past of how life developed from single-celled organisms to the tremendous variety of creatures that have
germinated, crawled, floated, swam, flown, and walked on this planet.
New species are discovered with frequent regularity, but it’s not too common to discover a new large mammal. However,
that’s what scientists did in Australia when they named a new species of cetacean the Australian humpback dolphin, Souse
sahulensis. The dolphin had originally been classified as another closely related species, but a closer look at its coloration,
skeletal structure, habitat, and DNA determined that it was in fact a separate species.
