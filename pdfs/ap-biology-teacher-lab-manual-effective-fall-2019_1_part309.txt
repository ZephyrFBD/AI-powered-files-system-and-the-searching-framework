 Potatoes, sweet potatoes, or yams 
•  8 or10 oz. drinking cups 
•  Cork borers or french fry cutter 
• Sucrose solutions of different   
concentrations (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 
1.0 M) 
  
• Balances 
• Metric rulers 
■ Preparation 
Prepare 2,000 mL of 1.0 M sucrose. Use this 1.0 M stock solution to make 1,000 mL 
dilutions (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 M). Use a drop of food coloring to give each solution 
a different color. The quantities are sufficient for 24 students and can be adjusted for 
smaller classes. 
Do not label the solutions for students! 
1.0 M: 684.6 g sucrose/2000 mL d-H20 
0.8 M: 800 mL of 1.0 M to 200 mL d-H2O 
0.6 M: 600 mL of 1.0 M to 400 mL d-H2O 
0.4 M: 400 mL of 1.0 M to 600 mL d-H2O 
0.2 M: 200 mL of 1.0 M to 800 mL d-H2O

■ Alternative Experiments 
This investigation consists of three parts. It is recommended that students work through 
all three sections. However, if time is an issue, the investigations can be modi
