are caused by current passing through the
body. To avoid shocks, the body must not become part of a
complete circuit by allowing different parts of the body to touch
objects at different potentials. Commonly, shocks are caused
by one part of the body touching ground 
and another
part touching a nonzero electric potential.
An ammeter measures current. An analog ammeter consists
of a galvanometer and a parallel shunt resistor that carries most
of the current. An analog voltmeter consists of a galvanometer
and a series resistor. An ammeter is inserted into the circuit
whose current is to be measured. A voltmeter is external, being
connected in parallel to the element whose voltage is to be mea-
sured. Digital meters have greater internal resistance and affect
the circuit to be measured less than do analog meters.
