Dryness in winter. Why does the air
inside heated buildings seem very dry on a cold winter day?
RESPONSE Suppose the relative humidity outside on a 
day is 50%.
Table 13–3 tells us the partial pressure of water in the air is about 1.0 torr.
If this air is brought indoors and heated to 
the relative humidity is
Even if the outside air were saturated at a partial
pressure of 1.95
