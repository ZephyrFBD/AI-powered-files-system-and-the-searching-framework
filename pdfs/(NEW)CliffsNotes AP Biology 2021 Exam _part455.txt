s removed. As a result, they are
now reproductively isolated and each is a separate species.
b. Polyploidy is the possession of one or more extra sets of chromosomes. As a result of nondisjunction during
meiosis, gametes (sperm and eggs) have double the normal number of chromosomes. When a sperm produced in this
manner fertilizes a similarly produced egg, the resulting diploid zygote also contains twice the normal number of
chromosomes. The result is a polyploid individual. When this new individual undergoes a normal meiosis, gametes
will contain twice the number of chromosomes (like its parent) and will be able to fertilize only similarly produced
gametes. Thus, the polyploid individual and its progeny are reproductively isolated from the original population.
The result is a speciation event occurring in a single generation. Polyploidy is common among plants and rare in
animals.
c. Sexual selection is the differential mating of males within a species. Only males that win contests with
