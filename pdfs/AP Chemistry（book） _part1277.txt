 a Lewis structure from a 
molecular formula. Our plan is to follow the five-step procedure 
just described.
Solve First, we sum the valence electrons. Phosphorus (group 
5A) has five valence electrons, and each chlorine (group 7A) has 
seven. The total number of valence electrons is therefore
5 + 13 * 72 = 26
Second, we arrange the atoms to show which atom is connected  
to which, and we draw a single bond between them. There are  
various ways the atoms might be arranged. It helps to know, 
though, that in binary compounds the first element in the  
chemical formula is generally surrounded by the remaining  
atoms. So we proceed to draw a skeleton structure in which a  
single bond connects the P atom to each Cl atom:
Cl atom accounts for 24 electrons (remember, each line in our 
structure represents two electrons):
Cl
Cl
Cl
P
(It is not crucial that the Cl atoms be to the left of, right of, and 
below the P atomâ€”any structure that shows each of the three  
Cl atoms bonded to P will
