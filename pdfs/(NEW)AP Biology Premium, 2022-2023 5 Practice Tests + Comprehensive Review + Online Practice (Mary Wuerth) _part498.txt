Rates of speciation can vary. If an environment is relatively stable, there will be less selective pressure on
populations, and the rate of speciation will be slower. This slow and constant pace of speciation is called
gradualism. If an environment rapidly changes, as it would after an asteroid strike, a volcanic eruption, or a rapid
change in climate, rapid evolution may occur. A long period of stability in a species interrupted by periods of rapid
evolution is called punctuated equilibrium.
Speciation can be allopatric or sympatric. In allopatric speciation, a larger population becomes geographically
separated and the smaller subgroups diverge and become separate species over time. Sympatric speciation occurs
in the same geographic area, but other factors lead to reproductive barriers between members of the groups. One
mechanism of sympatric speciation is polyploidy, the replication of extra s
