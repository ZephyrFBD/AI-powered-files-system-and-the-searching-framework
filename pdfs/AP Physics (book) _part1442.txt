1 Real Gases and Changes of Phase
The ideal gas law,
, is an accurate description of the behavior of a
real gas as long as the pressure is not too high and the temperature is far from 
the liquefaction point. But what happens when these two criteria are not satisfied?
First we discuss real gas behavior, and then we examine how kinetic theory can
help us understand this behavior.
Let us look at a graph of pressure plotted against volume for a given amount
of gas. On such a PV diagram, Fig. 13–21, each point represents the pressure and
volume of an equilibrium state of the
