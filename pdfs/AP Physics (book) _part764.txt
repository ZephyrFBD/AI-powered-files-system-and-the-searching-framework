c nucleus at rest decays radioactively into an
alpha particle and a different nucleus. What will be the speed
of this recoiling nucleus if the speed of the alpha particle 
is
Assume the recoiling nucleus has a mass
57 times greater than that of the alpha particle.
9. (II) An atomic nucleus initially moving at 
emits an
alpha particle in the direction of its velocity, and the remain-
ing nucleus slows to 
If the alpha particle has a
mass of 4.0 u and the original nucleus has a mass of 222 u,
what speed does the alpha particle have when it is emitted?
10. (II) An object at rest is suddenly broken apart into two
fragments by an explosion. One fragment acquires twice the
kinetic energy of the other. What is the ratio of their masses?
11. (II) A 22-g bullet traveling 
penetrates a 2.0-kg
block of wood and emerges going 
If the block is
stationary on a frictionless surface when hit, how fast does
it move after the bullet emerges?
