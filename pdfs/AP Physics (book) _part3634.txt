ation of baryon number. This could happen if
two quarks within a proton approached to within 
of each other. But it is
very unlikely at normal temperature and energy, so the decay of a proton can
only be an unlikely process. In the simplest form of GUT, the theoretical esti-
mate of the proton mean life for the decay mode
is about 
and this is now within the realm of testability.† Proton decays have still not been
seen, and experiments put the lower limit on the proton mean life for the above
mode to be about 
somewhat greater than this prediction. This may seem
a disappointment, but on the other hand, it presents a challenge. Indeed more
complex GUTs may resolve this conflict.
