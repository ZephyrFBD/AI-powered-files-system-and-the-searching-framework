species to survive in a changing
environment. If a population were all the same, then they would have the same weaknesses and the same strengths.
Natural selection occurs only if some individuals have more evolutionary fitness and can be selected. The more
variations there are among a population, the more likely that a trait will exist that might be the perfect lifesaver. One
famous (fictional) example is Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. His red nose was a random mutation, but under the
right conditions, it became the best nose to have. A more diverse population is more likely to survive and evolve
when things are constantly changing around them.
How did all this wonderful variation come about? Well, the simple answer is that random mutations are occurring all
the time. This can be because of errors by DNA polymerase, changes to DNA caused by transposons, or other types
of DNA damage. Either way, mutations create new variations and alleles.
However, just the occurrence of mutations does
