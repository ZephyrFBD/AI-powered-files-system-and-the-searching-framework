ed in glass bottles 
because compounds called silicates in the glass are attacked 
by the HF(aq). Sodium silicate 1Na2SiO32, for example, reacts 
as follows: 
Na2SiO31s2 + 8 HF1aq2 ยก  H2SiF61aq2 + 2 NaF1aq2 + 3 H2O1l2
(a) How many moles of HF are needed to react with 0.300 
mol of Na2SiO3?
(b) How many grams of NaF form when 0.500 mol of HF 
reacts with excess Na2SiO3?
(c) How many grams of Na2SiO3 can react with 0.800 g of HF?
 3.62  The reaction between potassium superoxide, KO2, and CO2,
 
 
4 KO2 + 2 CO2 ยก 2K2CO3 + 3 O2
 
 is used as a source of O2 and absorber of CO2 in self- 
contained breathing equipment used by rescue workers.
(a) How many moles of O2 are produced when 0.400 mol of 
KO2 reacts in this fashion?
(b) How many grams of KO2 are needed to form 7.50 g of O2?
 3.66  Calcium hydride reacts with water to form calcium hy-
droxide and hydrogen gas. (a) Write a balanced chemical 
equation for the reaction. (b) How many grams of calcium 
hydride are needed to form 4.500 g of
