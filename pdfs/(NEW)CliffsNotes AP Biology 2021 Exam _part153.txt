ments in chloroplasts of plant cells. A pigment
molecule is able to absorb the energy from light only within a narrow range of wavelengths. The dominant
lightabsorbing pigment is the green chlorophyll a, while other accessory pigments include other chlorophylls and
various red, orange, and yellow carotenoids. Together, these pigments complement each other to maximize energy
absorption across the sunlight spectrum. When light is absorbed by one of these pigments, the energy from the light
is incorporated into electrons within the atoms that make up the molecule. These energized electrons (or “excited”
electrons) are unstable and almost immediately reemit the absorbed energy. The energy is then reabsorbed by
electrons of a nearby pigment molecule. The process of energy absorption, followed by energy re-emission,
continues, with the energy bouncing from one pigment molecule to another. The process ends when the energy is
absorbed by one
of two special chlorophyll a molecules, P680 and P70
