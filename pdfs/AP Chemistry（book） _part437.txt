a and asked to determine 
its molar mass.
Plan Because the molar mass of any substance is numerically equal 
to its formula weight, we first determine the formula weight of 
glucose by adding the atomic weights of its component atoms. 
The formula weight will have units of amu, whereas the molar 
mass has units of grams per mole (g/mol).
Solve Our first step is to determine the formula weight of glucose:
 
6 C atoms = 6112.0 amu2 =
72.0 amu 
 
12 H atoms = 1211.0 amu2 =
12.0 amu 
 
6 O atoms = 6116.0 amu2 =
96.0 amu 
 
180.0 amu
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the number of grams of a substance and its 
chemical formula and asked to calculate the number of moles.
Plan The molar mass of a substance provides the factor for 
converting grams to moles. The  
molar mass of C6H12O6 is 
180.0 g>mol (Sample Exercise 3.9).
Because glucose has a formula weight of 180.0 amu, 1 mol of this 
substance 16.02 * 1023 molecules2 has a mass of 180.0 g. In other 
words, C6H12O6 has a molar mass of 180.0 g>
