n the amount of air (ventilation, V) and the amount of blood (perfusion, Q) in the lungs. This is
referred to as ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.
There are two types of V/Q mismatch. Both produce dead space, regions of broken down or blocked lung tissue. Dead
spaces can severely impact breathing, because they reduce the surface area available for gas diffusion. As a result, the
amount of oxygen in the blood decreases, whereas the carbon dioxide level increases. Dead space is created when no
ventilation and/or perfusion takes place. Anatomical dead space or anatomical shunt, arises from an anatomical failure,
while physiological dead space or physiological shunt, arises from a functional impairment of the lung or arteries.
An example of an anatomical shunt is the effect of gravity on the lungs. The lung is particularly susceptible to changes in the
magnitude and direction of gravitational forces. When someone is standing or sitting upright, the pleural pressure gradient
leads to in
