ctive, the transition of animals onto land
required changes in body design as locomotion on land presented a number of new challenges for animals that were adapted
to movement in the water, such as the effect of gravity and lack of buoyancy. Literally step-by-step, these adaptations
accumulated. Exploring the evolution of the musculoskeletal system in animals would provide information on this history.

Hydrostatic Skeleton
A hydrostatic skeleton is a skeleton formed by a fluid-filled compartment within the body, called the coelom. The organs
of the coelom are supported by the aqueous fluid, which also resists external compression. This compartment is under
hydrostatic pressure because of the fluid and supports the other organs of the organism. This type of skeletal system is found
in soft-bodied animals such as sea anemones, earthworms, Cnidaria,
