iquids, which
change in volume only slightly with a change in temperature. Gases change
strongly in volume with a change in temperature at constant pressure, as we saw
in Chapter 13 with the gas laws; or, if kept at constant volume, the pressure in a
gas changes strongly with temperature. The specific heat of a gas depends very
much on how the process of changing its temperature is carried out. Most com-
monly, we deal with the specific heats of gases kept (a) at constant pressure 
or (b) at constant volume 
Some values are given in Table 14–2, where we
see that

For liquids and solids, this distinction is 
usually negligible. More details are given in Appendix D on molecular specific
heats and the equipartition of energy.

14–4 Calorimetry—Solving Problems
In discussing heat and thermodynamics, we often consider a particular system,
which is any object or set of objects we choose to consider. Everything else in the
universe is its “environmen
