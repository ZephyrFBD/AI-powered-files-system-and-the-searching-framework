ic are relative terms, how a solution is characterized with these terms is
dependent on what you are comparing the solution to. For example, a cup of coffee may be considered hypertonic if
it is being compared to a cup of water. However, the same cup of coffee would be considered hypotonic if compared
to a cup of coffee to which two sugar cubes have been added.
TIP
Learning prefixes can help you remember terms and decode the definitions of unfamiliar terms. The prefix hyper- means “more,” the prefix
hypo- means “less,” and the prefix iso- means “same.”
An advantage of using water potential to describe solutions is that water potential is not a relative term; rather,
water potential can be calculated using a few simple equations. The calculated water potential values of solutions
make comparing these solutions more exact. This helps in predicting how water will move between solutions.
Water potential can be defined as the potential energy of water in a solution, or the ability of water
