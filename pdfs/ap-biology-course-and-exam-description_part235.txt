E-4.B
Explain how interactions 
within and among 
populations influence 
community structure.
ENE-4.B.1
Communities change over time depending on 
interactions between populations.
ENE-4.B.2
Interactions among populations determine 
how they access energy and matter within 
a community.
SUGGESTED SKILL
Statistical Tests and 
Data Analysis
5.B
Use confidence intervals 
and/or error bars (both 
determined using standard 
errors) to determine 
whether sample means are 
statistically different.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-4.A.1
The structure of a community is measured and 
described in terms of species composition and
species diversity.
RELEVANT EQUATION
Simpson's Diversity Index—Diversity index = 1 minus sum (n/N) ^2
  n =  
the total number of organisms of 
a particular species
N =  
total number of organisms of 
all species
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
ENE-4
Communities and ecosystems change on the basis of interactions among 
populations and disruptions to the environment.
