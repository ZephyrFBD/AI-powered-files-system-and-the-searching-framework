) For an He+ ion, do the 2s and 2p orbitals have the same 
energy? If not, which orbital has a lower energy? (b) If we 
add one electron to form the He atom, would your answer to 
part (a) change?
 6.68  (a) The average distance from the nucleus of a 3s electron in 
a chlorine atom is smaller than that for a 3p electron. In light 
of this fact, which orbital is higher in energy? (b) Would you 
 
expect it to require more or less energy to remove a 3s elec-
tron from the chlorine atom, as compared with a 2p electron?
 6.69  Two possible electron configurations 
for an Li atom are shown here. (a) Does 
either configuration violate the Pauli 
exclusion principle? (b) Does either 
configuration violate Hund’s rule? (c) 
In the absence of an external magnetic 
field, can we say that one electron con-
figuration has a lower energy than the 
other? If so, which one has the lowest 
energy?
