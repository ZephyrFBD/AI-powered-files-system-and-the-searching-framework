 strategy varies from each
model. That is to say that if the shape of bathtub changes, our strategy changes.
What’s more, these changes are not the same.
(3)Wasting water:
Because the speed of adding water v, the time of draining away water t and the
frequency of adding water all determines the volumes of wasting water. However, we
can control these factors, so there is no effect on wasting water.
(4)Conclusion:
The shape of bathtub has little impact on the previous strategy, so it is suitable
for different shaped bathtubs.
5.2 The volume of the tub
In the similar way, when it comes to volume, it is the same.

Different volume of bathtubs relate to different lengths, widths and heights.
Because we assume in the previous strategy that the height of water cylinder is the
depth of water, this is based on the hypothesis that the height of bathtub is not very
high. However, different bathtubs relate to different heights. If the height is too high,
our a
