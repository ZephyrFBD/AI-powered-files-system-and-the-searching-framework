between
investigations at either end of the size scale: theories about the tiniest objects
(elementary particles) have a strong bearing on the understanding of the
universe on a large scale. We look at this more in the next Chapter.
Figure 32–22 is a rough diagram indicating how the four fundamental forces
in nature might have “condensed out” (a symmetry was broken) as time went on
after the Big Bang (Chapter 33), and as the mean temperature of the universe
and the typical particle energy decreased.
