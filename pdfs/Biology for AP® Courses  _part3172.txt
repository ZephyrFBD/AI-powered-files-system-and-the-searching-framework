te information from multiple sensory receptors.
B. Describe what refinement of the basic stimulus-
response system in the diagram is needed to achieve even
the simplest response: “move away.” Awareness of
orientation and motion within a body is called
proprioception. Describe how multiple neurons are
required to acquire proprioception.
The generation of neurons occurs during development.
However, adults continue to form memories and learn.
Rearrangement of connections between neurons is a
possible explanation and in several studies steroid
hormones have been shown to produce dendritic plasticity.
The hippocampus is active during memory formation and
learning and significant variations in the number of
dendrites were observed in the hippocampus (Wooley et
al., Journal of Neuroscience, 10, 1990) were correlated
with variations in estrogen during the estrus cycle. More
recently variation in these structures is implicated in a
collection of behaviors known as chronic unpredictable
