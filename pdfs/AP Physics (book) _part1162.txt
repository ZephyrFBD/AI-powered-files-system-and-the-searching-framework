e circle (Fig. 11–7) is rotating with uniform angular
velocity 
We then can write
where is in radians (Section 8–1). Thus
(11;8a)
Furthermore, since the angular velocity 
(specified in radians per second) can be
written as
where f is the frequency (Eq. 8–7), we then write
(11;8b)
or in terms of the period T,
(11;8c)
Notice in Eq. 11–8c that when
(that is, after a time equal to one period),
we have the cosine of 
(or 360 ), which is the same as the cosine of zero. This makes
sense since the motion repeats itself after a time
Because the cosine function varies between 1 and 
Eqs. 11–8 tell us that 
x varies between A and 
as it must. If a pen is attached to a vibrating mass as
a sheet of paper is moved at a steady rate beneath it (Fig. 11–8), a sinusoidal
curve will be drawn that accurately follows Eqs. 11–8.
