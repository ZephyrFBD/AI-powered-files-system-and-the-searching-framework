ice B is referring to a single-stranded binding
protein. Choice D is referring to a helicase enzyme. (IST-1 & SP 2)
(D) The pairing rules are not as strict for the third codon in mRNA as
they are for the first two. One example is that UUU and UUA both
code for phenylalanine. (IST-1)
(C) Sickle cell anemia is caused by a gene mutation in the gene that
codes for hemoglobin. Sickle cell disease is common where malaria
is endemic: in West Africa and Southeast Asia. People who are
carriers for the sickle cell trait are resistant to malaria. Sickle cell

and anticodons are complementary to each other. (IST-1)
(B) DNA consists of nucleotides
