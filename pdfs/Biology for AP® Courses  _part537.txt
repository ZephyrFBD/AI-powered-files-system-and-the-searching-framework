e the interior and exterior of the cell are hydrophilic. In contrast, the interior of the cell membrane
is hydrophobic and will not interact with water. Therefore, phospholipids form an excellent two-layer cell membrane that
separates fluid within the cell from the fluid outside of the cell.
A phospholipid molecule (Figure 5.3) consists of a three-carbon glycerol backbone with two fatty acid molecules attached
to carbons 1 and 2, and a phosphate-containing group attached to the third carbon. This arrangement gives the overall
molecule an area described as its head (the phosphate-containing group), which has a polar character or negative charge,
and an area called the tail (the fatty acids), which has no charge. The head can form hydrogen bonds, but the tail cannot. A
molecule with this arrangement of a positively or negatively charged area and an uncharged, or non-polar, area is referred
to as amphiphilic or “dual-loving.”
