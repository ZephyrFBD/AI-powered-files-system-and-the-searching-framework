in-
drical lens focuses a point into a line parallel to its axis. An astigmatic eye may
focus rays in one plane, such as the vertical plane, at a shorter distance than it does
for rays in a horizontal plane. Astigmatism is corrected with the use of a compen-
sating cylindrical lens. Lenses for eyes that are nearsighted or farsighted as well 
as astigmatic are ground with superimposed spherical and cylindrical surfaces, so
that the radius of curvature of the correcting lens is different in different planes.
Farsighted eye. A farsighted eye has a near point of 
100 cm. Reading glasses must have what lens power so that a newspaper can be
read at a distance of 25 cm? Assume the lens is very close to the eye.
APPROACH When the object is placed 25 cm from the lens (
), we want the
image to be 100 cm away on the same side of the lens (so the eye can focus it),
and so the image is virtual, as shown in Fig. 25–13, and
will be
negative. We use the thin lens equation (Eq. 23–8) to determine the n
