Viroids
Viroids are plant pathogens: small, single-stranded, circular RNA particles that are much simpler than a virus. They do not
have a capsid or outer envelope, but like viruses can reproduce only within a host cell. Viroids do not, however, manufacture
any proteins, and they only produce a single, specific RNA molecule. Human diseases caused by viroids have yet to be
identified.
Viroids are known to infect plants (Figure 21.19) and are responsible for crop failures and the loss of millions of dollars
in agricultural revenue each year. Some of the plants they infect include potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, chrysanthemums,
avocados, and coconut palms.
