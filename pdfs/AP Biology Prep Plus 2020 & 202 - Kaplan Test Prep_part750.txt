n molecular analysis of DNA sequences. The tree
on the right was based on morphological characteristics. Lines
between the two trees connect individual species.
Which of the following is a reasonable conclusion from the
phylogenetic trees shown?
No significant diﬀerences exist between the phylogenetic
relatedness predicted by the molecular analysis of DNA
sequences and the morphological analysis.
(A)
Molecular analysis of DNA sequences incorrectly predicted the
phylogenetic relatedness of firefly species.
(B)
Morphological analysis incorrectly predicted the phylogenetic
relatedness of firefly species.
(C)
Significant diﬀerences in the hypothesized phylogenies exist.
Additional morphological and molecular studies should be
done to resolve the positions of diﬀerent species.
(D)
7. The figure below shows phylogenetic relationships of several
groups of bees and their social behavior.
Which of the following conclusions can most reasonably be drawn
from the information in the cladogram?
