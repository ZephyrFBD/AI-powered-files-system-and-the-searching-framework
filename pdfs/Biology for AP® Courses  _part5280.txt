number of innocent people killed in Aktion T4 was between 275,000
and 300,000. Parents were told their children had been sent away for
‘special treatment’ never to return. It is rather pathetic to see claims
about plans for new extermination camps being dismissed today
when the same force behind current events did precisely that 80
years ago. Margaret Sanger was a Cult operative who used ‘birth

founded became what is now Planned Parenthood. Sanger proposed
that ‘the whole dysgenic population would have its choice of
segregation or sterilization’. These included epileptics, ‘feeble-

perpetuated ‘human waste‘. She reveals the Cult mentality and if
anyone thinks that extermination camps are a ‘conspiracy theory’
their naivety is touching if breathtakingly stupid.
