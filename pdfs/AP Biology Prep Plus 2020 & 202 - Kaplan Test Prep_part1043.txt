 allele XA. The corresponding normal allele is Xa. If the patient’s mother
inherited the disease from her father (the patient’s grandfather), her genotype is XAXa.
Because the patient’s father is also aﬀected, his genotype is XAY. The cross is, therefore,
XAXa × XAY. Using a Punnett square, the oﬀspring can have the following genotypes:
XA
Xa
XA
Xa
XA
XAXA
XAXa
Y
XAY
XaY
The patient’s chances of having the disease are 75%, because 3 of the 4 oﬀspring in the
Punnett square inherit the dominant XA allele. (C) is thus correct.
34. D
Symbiosis is simply defined as organisms living in close association with each other. (A) is
an example of parasitism, (B) of commensalism, and (C) of mutualism, all forms of
symbiosis. (D) is an example of predation, one organism feeding on another, which is not
a form of symbiosis.
35. B
Most cell movement is associated with the cytoskeleton, so (B) is correct. Changes in the
plasma membrane, as in (A), are associated with endocytosis and exocytosis. Cilia,
