weight. Whether or not that concentration is harmful is
uncertain.
In a study of Ca+2 oscillations in GnRH expressing
neurons, Klenke and co-workers (Endocrinology, 157,
2016) presented evidence that BPA switches off
oscillations even at these very low concentrations. This
suggests a mechanism for the results from an earlier
investigation in which female rats were fed low and high
levels of estrogen (EE) and BPA during pregnancy.
Measurements were made of the levels of expression of an
estrogen nuclear receptor in the hypothalamus of the pups
just after birth (Cao et al., Toxicological Sciences, 133,
2013). Their data are shown in the graph below.

Using the data, the graph at the top compares expression in
a “do-nothing” control (Naïve) and a control (Vehicle) in
which a feeding tube is used to deliver nutrients during
pregnancy. The graph at the bottom shows expression
levels in pups born to female rats with four different
treatments of estrogen (EE)
