12.3 | Laws of Inheritance
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What is the relationship between Mendel’s law of segregation and independent assortment in terms of genetics and
the events of meiosis?
•
How can the forked-lined method and probability rules be used to calculate the probability of genotypes and
phenotypes from multiple gene crosses?
•
How do linkage, cross-over, epistasis, and recombination violate Mendel’s laws of inheritance?
Connection for AP® Courses
As was described previously, Mendel proposed that genes are inherited as pairs of alleles that behave in a dominant and
recessive pattern. During meiosis, alleles segregate, or separate, such that each gamete is equally likely to receive either one
of the two alleles present in the diploid individual. Mendel called this phenomenon the law of segregation, which can be
demonstrated in a monohybrid cross. In addition, gen
