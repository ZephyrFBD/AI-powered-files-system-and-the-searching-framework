 water-soluble ionic compounds are strong electrolytes. Ionic 
compounds can usually be identified by the presence of both metals and nonmetals [for 
example, NaCl, FeSO4, and Al(NO3234. Ionic compounds containing the ammonium ion, 
NH4
+ [for example, NH4Br and 1NH422CO34, are exceptions to this rule of thumb.
Give It Some Thought
Which solute will cause the light bulb in Figure 4.2 to glow most brightly, CH3OH, 
NaOH, or CH3COOH?
 
Sample Exercise 4.1 
Relating Relative Numbers of Anions and Cations to Chemical Formulas
The accompanying diagram represents an aqueous solution of either MgCl2, 
KCl, or K2SO4. Which solution does the drawing best represent?
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to associate the charged spheres in the diagram 
with ions present in a solution of an ionic substance.
Plan We examine each ionic substance given to determine the relative 
numbers and charges of its ions. We then correlate these ionic  
species with the ones shown in the diagram.
Solve The diagram show
