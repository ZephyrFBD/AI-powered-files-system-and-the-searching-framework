f gravity? Does our understanding of gravity need to be revised?
We don’t know the answers to these questions. Many scientists say dark energy is
the biggest mystery facing physical science today. There are several speculations.
But somehow it seems to have a long-range repulsive effect on space, like a nega-
tive gravity, causing objects to speed away from each other ever faster. Whatever
it is, it has been given the name dark energy.
One idea is a sort of quantum field given the name quintessence. Another
possibility suggests an energy latent in space itself (vacuum energy) and relates to
an aspect of General Relativity known as the cosmological constant
When Einstein developed his equations, he found that they offered no solutions
for a static universe. In those days (1917) it was thought the universe was static—
unchanging and everlasting. Einstein added an arbitrary constant ( ) to his
equations to provide solutions for a static universe. A decade later, when Hubble
showed us an e
