till an ambiguity
since 
could point in either direction along the axis of rotation (up or down 
in Fig. 8–30a). The convention we use, called the right-hand rule, is this: when 
the fingers of the right hand are curled around the rotation axis and point in the
direction of the rotation, then the thumb points in the direction of 
This is
shown in Fig. 8–30b. Note that 
points in the direction a right-handed screw
would move when turned in the direction of rotation. Thus, if the rotation of the
wheel in Fig. 8–30a is counterclockwise, the direction of 
is upward as shown in
Fig. 8–30b. If the wheel rotates clockwise, then 
points in the opposite direction,
downward. Note that no part of the rotating object moves in the direction of 
If the axis of rotation is fixed, then 
can change only in magnitude. Thus
must also point along the axis of rotation. If the rotation is counter-
clockwise as in Fig. 8–30a and the magnitude of 
is increasing, then 
points
upward; but if 
is decreasing (the
