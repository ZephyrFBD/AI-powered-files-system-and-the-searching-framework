esult in chromosome breakage than
exposure to lead.
(d) The independent variable is the type of treatment (control, lead, or cadmium). The dependent variable is the
mean percentage of cells that showed chromosome breakage.
12. (a) There are two possible outcomes in this experiment (green or albino), so the number of degrees of freedom
(df) = 2 â€“ 1 = 1.
(b)
(c) The observed data are likely statistically significantly different from the expected data.
(d) With one degree of freedom and using a p-value of 0.05, the critical value from the chi-square table is 3.84.
Since the calculated chi-square value (4) is greater than the critical value, there is likely a statistically
significant difference between the observed and expected values.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) The section of the garden with the least variability in aphid density is the section treated with chemical
pesticide because its 95% confidence interval is the smallest. The section with the most variability is the
section treated
