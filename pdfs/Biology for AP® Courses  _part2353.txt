ruses
enter the cell when the viral envelope fuses directly with the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, the viral capsid is
degraded, and the viral nucleic acid is released, which then becomes available for replication and transcription.
Replication and Assembly
The replication mechanism depends on the viral genome. DNA viruses usually use host cell proteins and enzymes to make
additional DNA that is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then used to direct protein synthesis. RNA viruses
usually use the RNA core as a template for synthesis of viral genomic RNA and mRNA. The viral mRNA directs the host
cell to synthesize viral enzymes and capsid proteins, and assemble new virions. Of course, there are exceptions to this
pattern. If a host cell does not provide the enzymes necessary for viral replication, viral genes supply the information to
direct synthesis of the missing proteins. Retroviruses have an RNA genome that must be reverse transcribed into DNA,
which then is incorp
