APTER 6 Electronic Structure of Atoms
Chapter Summary and Key Terms
WAVELENGTHS AND FREQUENCIES OF LIGHT (INTRODUCTION 
AND SECTION 6.1) The electronic structure of an atom describes the 
energies and arrangement of electrons around the atom. Much of 
what is known about the electronic structure of atoms was obtained 
by observing the interaction of light with matter.
Visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation (also 
known as radiant energy) move through a vacuum at the speed of 
light, c = 2.998 * 108 m>s. Electromagnetic radiation has both 
electric and magnetic components that vary periodically in wave-
like fashion. The wave characteristics of radiant energy allow it to 
be described in terms of wavelength, l, and frequency, n, which are 
interrelated: ln = c.
QUANTIZED ENERGY AND PHOTONS (SECTION 6.2) Planck pro-
posed that the minimum amount of radiant energy that an object 
can gain or lose is related to the frequency of the radiation: E = hn.
