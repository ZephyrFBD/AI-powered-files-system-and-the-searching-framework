22. (III) Agent Arlene devised the following method of 
measuring the muzzle velocity of a rifle (Fig. 11–52). She
fires a bullet into a 4.148-kg wooden block resting on a
smooth surface, and attached to a spring of spring constant
The bullet, whose mass is 7.870 g, remains
embedded in the wooden block. She measures the maximum
distance that the block compresses the spring to be 9.460 cm.
What is the speed v of the bullet?
k = 162.7 Nm.

23. (III) A bungee jumper with mass 65.0 kg jumps from a
high bridge. After arriving at his lowest point, he oscillates
up and down, reaching a low point seven more times in
43.0 s. He finally comes to rest 25.0 m below the level of
the bridge. Estimate the spring stiffness constant and the
unstretched length of the bungee cord assuming SHM.
24. (III) A block of mass m is supported by two identical
parallel vertical springs, each with spring stiffness con-
