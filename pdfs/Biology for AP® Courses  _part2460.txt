ironment, while other molecules may move through the membrane. Recall that the
general structure of a cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer composed of two layers of lipid molecules. In archaeal cell
membranes, isoprene (phytanyl) chains linked to glycerol replace the fatty acids linked to glycerol in bacterial membranes.
Some archaeal membranes are lipid monolayers instead of bilayers (Figure 22.14).

Figure 22.15 Archaeal phospholipids differ from those found in Bacteria and Eukarya in two ways. First, they have
branched phytanyl sidechains instead of linear ones. Second, an ether bond instead of an ester bond connects the
lipid to the glycerol.
The Cell Wall
The cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells has a high concentration of dissolved solutes. Therefore, the osmotic pressure within
the cell is relatively high. The cell wall is a protective layer that surrounds some cells and gives them shape and rigidity.
It is located outside the cell
