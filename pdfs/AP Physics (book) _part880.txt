s in this time.
18. (I) A centrifuge accelerates uniformly from rest to 15,000 rpm
in 240 s. Through how many revolutions did it turn in this
time?
19. (I) Pilots can be tested for the stresses of flying high-speed
jets in a whirling “human centrifuge,” which takes 1.0 min
to turn through 23 complete revolutions before reaching
its final speed. (a) What was its angular acceleration
(assumed constant), and (b) what was its final angular
speed in rpm?
20. (II) A cooling fan is turned off when it is running at
It turns 1250 revolutions before it comes to a
stop. (a) What was the fan’s angular acceleration, assumed
constant? (b) How long did it take the fan to come to a
complete stop?
21. (II) A wheel 31 cm in diameter accelerates uniformly from
240 rpm to 360 rpm in 6.8 s. How far will a point on the
edge of the wheel have traveled in this time?
22. (II) The tires of a car make 75 revolutions as the car
reduces its speed uniformly from 
to 
The
tires have a diameter of 0.80 m. (a) What wa
