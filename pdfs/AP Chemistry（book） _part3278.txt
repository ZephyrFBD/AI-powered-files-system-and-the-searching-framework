ated with the Ksp and see how it relates to E ° for 
the reduction half-reaction in (a). For (c) we need to compare E° 
from (b) with the value for the reduction of Fe2+.
FeF21s2 + 2 e- ¡ Fe1s2 + 2 F -1aq2
Fe2+1aq2 + 2 e- ¡ Fe1s2  E = -0.440 V
FeF21s2 ∆Fe2+1aq2 + 2 F-1aq2  Ksp = 3Fe2+43F-42 = 2.4 * 10-6 
    
 
1.                   FeF21s2 ¡ Fe2+1aq2 + 2 F-1aq2
  
 
2.    Fe2+1aq2 + 2 e- ¡ Fe1s2
Overall: 
 
3.       FeF21s2 + 2 e- ¡ Fe1s2 + 2 F-1aq2

Putting Concepts Together
(b) The Ksp for FeF2 refers to the following equi-
librium:  
 (Section 17.4)
We were also asked to use the standard 
reduction potential of Fe2+, whose half- 
reaction and standard reduction potentials 
are listed in Appendix E:
According to Hess’s law, if we can add chemical 
equations to get a desired equation, then we 
can add their associated thermodynamic state 
functions, like ∆H or ∆G, to determine the 
thermodynamic quantity for the desired reac-
tion.
