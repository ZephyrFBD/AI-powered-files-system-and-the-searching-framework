n, which in turn sequesters glucose
from the blood.
c.
Decreased calcium levels stimulate increased
calcium absorption.
d.
Activation of one clotting factor stimulates
production of other clotting factors until a fibrin
clot is produced.
55. Both negative and positive feedback loops are essential
for maintaining proper body functions. Blood calcium and
blood clotting are under the control of different feedback
loops. Which of these processes is maintained by a
positive feedback loop and why?
a.
Blood clotting is maintained by a positive
feedback loop, as clotting is amplified in
response by increasing the amount of clotting
factors when clotting factors are present.
b.
Blood clotting is maintained by a positive
feedback loop, as clotting factors are maintained
in a specific range and a positive loop helps
return the conditions to the set point.
c.
Blood calcium is maintained by a positive
feedback loop, as calcium levels are amplified in
response by increasing the amount of calcium
