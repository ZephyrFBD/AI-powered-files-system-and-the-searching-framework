e caused by errors during
meiosis and gamete formation. Examples are Down syndrome,
Turner syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome. Chromosomal
mutations are identified on a karyotype because the number and
placement of chromosomes is other than 46.
A backcross or testcross is an actual mating carried out between an
animal of unknown genotype that shows the dominant trait (Bb or
BB) with one that exhibits the recessive trait (bb). The purpose is to
determine the genotype of the animal that expresses the dominant
trait.
Linked genes, which are genes on the same chromosome, are often

inherited together, especially if they are close together. However, if
two linked genes are far apart on a chromosome, a crossover event
might separate them during meiosis. So they will not be inherited
together. The results of a crossover are a recombination of alleles
and an increase in genetic diversity, which are necessary for
evolution.
