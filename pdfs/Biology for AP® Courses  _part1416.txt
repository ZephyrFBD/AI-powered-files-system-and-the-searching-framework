Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance
The speculation that chromosomes might be the key to understanding heredity led several scientists to examine Mendelâ€™s
publications and re-evaluate his model in terms of the behavior of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. In 1902,
Theodor Boveri observed that proper embryonic development of sea urchins does not occur unless chromosomes are
present. That same year, Walter Sutton observed the separation of chromosomes into daughter cells during meiosis (Figure
13.2). Together, these observations led to the development of the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance, which identified
chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for Mendelian inheritance.
