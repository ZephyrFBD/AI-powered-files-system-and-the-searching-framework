pelican. Thanks to applied science, scientists knew how to rehabilitate the bird. (credit: FEMA)
Some individuals may perceive applied science as “useful” and basic science as “useless.” A question these people might
pose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, “What for?” A careful look at the history of science,
however, reveals that basic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value. Many scientists think
that a basic understanding of science is necessary before an application is developed; therefore, applied science relies on
the results generated through basic science. Other scientists think that it is time to move on from basic science and instead
to find solutions to actual problems. Both approaches are valid. It is true that there are problems that demand immediate
attention; however, few solutions would be found without the help of the wide knowledge foundation
