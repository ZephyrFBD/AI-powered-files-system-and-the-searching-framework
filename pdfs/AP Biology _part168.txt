ll in S phase would move into G2 and then M. (IST-1 & SP 2)
(A) Notice the difference between Figure 1 and Figure 2. The spindle
is much shorter on the chromosome end in Figure 2. The
kinetochore is on the chromosome and is the attachment site for the
spindle fiber. (SP 2)
(C) Since the spindle fiber near the chromosome in Figure 3 is much
shorter than it was in Figure 2, and given the two possible theories
described in the background information that preceded Questions 21
and 22, the experiment confirms that kinetochores actively “walk”
on the microtubules of the spindle. (SP 1)
