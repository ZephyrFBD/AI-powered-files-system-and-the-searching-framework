Where will an
object at infinity be focused?
*59. (II) Two 25.0-cm-focal-length converging lenses are placed
16.5 cm apart. An object is placed 35.0 cm in front of one
lens. Where will the final image formed by the second lens
be located? What is the total magnification?
*60. (II) A 38.0-cm-focal-length converging lens is 28.0 cm
behind a diverging lens. Parallel light strikes the diverging
lens. After passing through the converging lens, the light is
again parallel. What is the focal length of the diverging
lens? [Hint: First draw a ray diagram.]
*61. (II) Two lenses, one converging with focal length 20.0 cm
and one diverging with focal length 
are placed
25.0 cm apart. An object is placed 60.0 cm in front of the
converging lens. Determine (a) the position and (b) the
magnification of the final image formed. (c) Sketch a ray
diagram for this system.
