which requires a temperature of 106 to 107 K. Use the mass 
of the helium-4 nucleus given in Table 21.7 to determine 
how much energy is released per mol of hydrogen atoms.
 21.64  The spent fuel elements from a fission reactor are much 
more intensely radioactive than the original fuel ele-
ments. (a) What does this tell you about the products 
of the fission process in relationship to the belt of sta-
bility, Figure 21.2? (b) Given that only two or three neu-
trons are released per fission event and knowing that 
the nucleus undergoing fission has a neutron-to-proton 
ratio characteristic of a heavy nucleus, what sorts of 
decay would you expect to be dominant among the fis-
sion products?
 21.65  Which type or types of nuclear reactors have these 
characteristics?
(a) Does not use a secondary coolant
(b) Creates more fissionable material than it consumes
(c) Uses a gas, such as He or CO
