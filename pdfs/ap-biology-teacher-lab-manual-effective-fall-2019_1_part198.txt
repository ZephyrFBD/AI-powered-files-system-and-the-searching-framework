owing these plants for another generation (maybe another 
round of selection), you do not have to save these plants. You can discard them and clean 
up your growing equipment at this point. 
Step 14 Compile, analyze, and graph the class data as you did for the first generation. 
What is the outcome of your artificial selection? Be sure to record this preliminary 
analysis in your notebook.

■ Analyzing and Evaluating Results 
Up to this point of the investigation, your analysis has largely been descriptive, but your 
data should raise some questions. 
•  Are the two populations/generations before and after selection actually different? 
•  Are the means significantly different? 
•  Should you use median or mean as a measure of central tendencies at this point in 
the investigation? 
•  Compare your two graphs from the two populations. The chapter on quantitative 
methods in this lab manual (Chapter 3) provides some guidance here. Consider
