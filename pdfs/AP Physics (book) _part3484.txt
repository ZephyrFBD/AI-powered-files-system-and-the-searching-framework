le, so their loss is serious.) But if
many cells die, the organism may not be able to recover. On the other hand, a cell
may survive but be defective. It may go on dividing and produce many more
defective cells, to the detriment of the whole organism. Thus radiation can cause
cancer—the rapid uncontrolled production of cells.
The possible damage done by the medical use of X-rays and other radiation
must be balanced against the medical benefits and prolongation of life as a result
of their diagnostic use.

1–5 Measurement of Radiation—
Dosimetry
Although the passage of ionizing radiation through the human body can cause
considerable damage, radiation can also be used to treat certain diseases, particu-
larly cancer, often by using very narrow beams directed at a cancerous tumor in
order to destroy it (Section 31–6). It is therefore important to be able to quantify
the amount, or dose, of radiation. This is the subject of dosimetry.
