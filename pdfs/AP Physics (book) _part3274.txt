on that fills a hole moves a very short distance 
whereas holes move
much larger distances and so are the real carriers of the current. We can tell the current is carried by
positive charges (holes) by using the Hall effect, Section 20–4.

(a) Four (outer) electrons surround
each silicon atom. (b) Silicon crystal
doped with a small percentage of
arsenic atoms: the extra electron
doesn’t fit into the crystal lattice and
so is free to move about. This is an
n-type semiconductor.

FIGURE 29–27 A p-type semiconductor,
boron-doped silicon. (a) Boron has only three
outer electrons, so there is an empty spot, or
hole in the structure. (b) Electrons from
silicon atoms can jump into the hole and fill it.
As a result, the hole moves to a new location
(to the right in this diagram), to where the
electron used t
