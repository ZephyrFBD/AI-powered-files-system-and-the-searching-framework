kage groups. Linked genes tend to be inherited together and do not
assort independently (unless they are separated by a crossover event during
meiosis and gamete formation).

REMEMBER
Sex-linked traits are located on the X chromosome.
Sex-linkage
Of the 46 human chromosomes, 44 (22 pairs) are autosomes and 2 are sex
chromosomes, X and Y. Traits carried on the X chromosome are called
sex-linked. Few genes are carried on the Y chromosome. Females (XX)
inherit two copies of the sex-linked genes. If a sex-linked trait is due to a
recessive mutation, a female will express the phenotype only if she
carries two mutated genes (X–X–). If she carries only one mutated X-
linked gene, she will be a carrier (X–X). If a sex-linked trait is due to a
dominant mutation, a female will express the phenotype with only one
mutated gene (X–X). Males (XY) inherit only one X-linked gene. As a
result, if the male inherits a mutated X-linked gene (X–Y), he will
