der The sum of the reaction orders of all the 
reactants appearing in the rate expression when the rate can be 
expressed as rate = k3A4a3B4b…. (Section 14.3)
overlap The extent to which atomic orbitals on different atoms 
share the same region of space. When the overlap between two 
orbitals is large, a strong bond may be formed. (Section 9.4)
oxidation A process in which a substance loses one or more 
electrons. (Section 4.4)
oxidation number (oxidation state) A positive or negative whole 
number assigned to an element in a molecule or ion on the basis 
of a set of formal rules; to some degree it reflects the positive or 
negative character of that atom. (Section 4.4)
oxidation–reduction (redox) reaction A reaction in which 
electrons are transferred from one reactant to another and the 
oxidation states of these atoms change. (Section 4.4; Chapter 
20: Introduction)
oxidizing agent, or oxidant The substance that is reduced and 
thereby causes the oxidation of some other substance in
