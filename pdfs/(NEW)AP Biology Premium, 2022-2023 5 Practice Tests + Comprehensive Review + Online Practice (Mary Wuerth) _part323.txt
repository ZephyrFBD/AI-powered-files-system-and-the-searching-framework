oduce the phenotype. Because more than one gene is
involved in producing the trait, these traits would not follow the ratios predicted by Mendelian laws. Some examples
of traits that are produced by multiple genes are height and eye color. For example, say height in a plant is
determined by three genes (A, B, and C), and each dominant allele present in the three genes has an additive effect
on the plantâ€™s height. The more dominant alleles a plant inherits, the taller the plant will be. A plant with the
genotype AABBCC would be very tall, while a plant with the genotype aabbcc would be very short. A plant with the
genotype AaBbCc would have a height in the middle of the range. Note that many different genotypes (i.e., AAbbCc
or AaBBcc or aaBbCC) would result in a plant with a height in the middle of the range.
Nonnuclear Inheritance
As discussed in Chapter 5, mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA separate from nuclear DNA. Genes
on mitochondrial or chloroplast DNA do not foll
