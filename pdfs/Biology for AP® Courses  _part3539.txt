CHAPTER SUMMARY
29.1 Types of Skeletal Systems
The three types of skeleton designs are hydrostatic skeletons, exoskeletons, and endoskeletons. A hydrostatic skeleton is
formed by a fluid-filled compartment held under hydrostatic pressure; movement is created by the muscles producing
pressure on the fluid. An exoskeleton is a hard external skeleton that protects the outer surface of an organism and enables
movement through muscles attached on the inside. An endoskeleton is an internal skeleton composed of hard, mineralized
tissue that also enables movement by attachment to muscles. The human skeleton is an endoskeleton that is composed of
the axial and appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton is composed of the bones of the skull, ossicles of the ear, hyoid
bone, vertebral column, and ribcage. The skull consists
