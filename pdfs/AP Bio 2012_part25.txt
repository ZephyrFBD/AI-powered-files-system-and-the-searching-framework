Questions 7-10 
A biologist spent many years researching the rate 
of evolutionary change in the finch populations of a 
group of islands. It was determined that the average 
beak size (both length and mass) of finches in a 
certain population increased dramatically during an 
intense drought between 1981 and 1987. During the 
drought, there was a reduction in the number of plants 
producing thin-walled seeds. 
 
 7. Which of the following procedures was most 
likely followed to determine the change in beak 
size? 
(A) A few finches were trapped in 1981 and 
again in 1987, and their beak sizes were 
compared. 
(B) The beak size in fifteen finches was measured  
in 1987, and the beak size in the original 
finches was determined by estimation. 
(C) The beak size in a lar
