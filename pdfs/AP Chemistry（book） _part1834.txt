dots are semiconductor 
nanocrystals that have size-dependent properties in the 1–10 nm scale.
 12.1  ▶ Classification of Solids Examine 
the classification of solids according to the 
types of bonding interactions that hold the 
atoms together. This classification helps 
us make general predictions about the 
properties of solids.
 12.2  ▶ Structures of Solids Learn that in 
crystalline solids the atoms are arranged 
in an orderly, repeating pattern but in 
amorphous solids this order is missing. 
Learn about lattices and unit cells, 
which define the repeating patterns that 
characterize crystalline solids.
 
12.3  ▶ Metallic Solids Examine the properties 
and structures of metals. Learn that many 
metals have structures in which the atoms 
pack together as closely as possible. Examine 
various types of alloys, materials that contain 
more than one element and display the 
characteristic properties of a metal.
 
12.4  ▶ Metallic Bonding Examine metallic 
bonding and how it is respons
