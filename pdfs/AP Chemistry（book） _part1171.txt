 Using the simple method of estimating effective nuclear 
charge, Equation 7.1, how does the intensity of the light bulb 
and/or the thickness of the frosting change in the following 
cases: (a) Moving from boron to carbon? (b) Moving from 
boron to aluminum? [Section 7.2]
 
7.2  Which of these spheres represents F, which represents Br, 
and which represents Br-? [Section 7.3]
 
7.3  Consider the Mg2+, Cl-, K+, and Se2- ions. The four spheres 
below represent these four ions, scaled according to ionic size. 
 
(a) Without referring to Figure 7.8, match each ion to its appro-
priate sphere. (b) In terms of size, between which of the spheres 
would you ﬁnd the (i) Ca2 + and (ii) S2 - ions? [Section 7.3]
