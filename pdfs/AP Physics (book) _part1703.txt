Calculate (a) the work done by the
gas, and (b) the change in internal energy of the gas.
(c) Graph this process on a PV diagram.
58. A restaurant refrigerator has a coefficient of perfor-
mance of 4.6. If the temperature in the kitchen outside the
refrigerator is 32°C, what is the lowest temperature that
could be obtained inside the refrigerator if it were ideal?
59. A particular car does work at the rate of about 
when traveling at a steady 
along a level road. This
is the work done against friction. The car can travel 17 km
on 1.0 L of gasoline at this speed (about 
). What
is the minimum value for 
if
is 25°C? The energy
available from 1.0 L of gas is 
60. A “Carnot” refrigerator (the reverse of a Carnot engine)
absorbs heat from the freezer compartment at a temperature
of 
and exhausts it into the room at 25°C. (a) How
much work would the refrigerator do to change 0.65kg of water
at 25°C into ice at 
(b) If the compressor output is
105 W and runs 25% of the time, how long will thi
