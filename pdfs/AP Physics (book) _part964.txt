in all directions, as we shall see in Chapter 10. Pressure is
defined as force per unit area, and thus is the equivalent of stress. For this situation
the change in volume,
is proportional to the original volume,
and to the
change in the pressure,
. We thus obtain a relation of the same form as Eq. 9–4
but with a proportionality constant called the bulk modulus B:

or
The minus sign means the volume decreases with an increase in pressure.

Values for the bulk modulus are given in Table 9–1. Since liquids and gases
do not have a fixed shape, only the bulk modulus (not the Young’s or shear moduli)
applies to them.
9–6 Fracture
If the stress on a solid object is too great, the object fractures, or breaks (Fig. 9–24).
Table 9–2 lists the ultimate strengths for tension, compression, and shear for a
variety of materials. These values give the maximum force per unit area, or stress,
that an object can withstand under each of these three typ
