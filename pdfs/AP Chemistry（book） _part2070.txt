o a car’s 
radiator to lower the freezing point of the solution. The added solute also raises the boil-
ing point of the solution above that of pure water, making it possible to operate the engine 
at a higher temperature.
Lowering of the freezing point and raising of the boiling point are physical prop-
erties of solutions that depend on the quantity (concentration) but not on the kind or 
identity of the solute particles. Such properties are called colligative properties. (Colli-
gative means “depending on the collection”; colligative properties depend on the collec-
tive effect of the number of solute particles.)
In addition to freezing-point lowering and boiling-point raising, two other import-
ant colligative properties are vapor–pressure lowering and osmotic pressure. As we exam-
ine each one, notice how solute concentration quantitatively affects the property.
Vapor–Pressure Lowering
A liquid in a closed container establishes equilibrium with its vapor.
