process. The length of the promoter is gene-specific and can differ dramatically between genes. Consequently, the level
of control of gene expression can also differ quite dramatically between genes. The purpose of the promoter is to bind
transcription factors that control the initiation of transcription.
Within the promoter region, just upstream of the transcriptional start site, resides the TATA box. This box is simply a
repeat of thymine and adenine dinucleotides (literally, TATA repeats). RNA polymerase binds to the transcription initiation
complex, allowing transcription to occur. To initiate transcription, a transcription factor (TFIID) is the first to bind to the
TATA box. Binding of TFIID recruits other transcription factors, including TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH to the TATA
box. Once this complex is assembled, RNA polymerase can bind to its upstream sequence. When bound along with the
transcription factors, RNA polymerase is phosphorylated. This releases part of t
