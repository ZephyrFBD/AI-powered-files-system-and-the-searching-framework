USE WHAT YOU NEED
The multiple parts of each question may connect to each other, but they’re answered individually. Label the
information that you’ve just set aside so that you know you’ve got enough to get all the available points for each

a well-written, educated guess may get you partial credit, even if you’re not sure about it.
