Optical Instruments
A camera lens forms an image on film, or on an electronic
sensor (CCD or CMOS) in a digital camera. Light is allowed in
briefly through a shutter. The image is focused by moving the
lens relative to the film or sensor, and the f-stop (or lens
opening) must be adjusted for the brightness of the scene and
the chosen shutter speed. The f-stop is defined as the ratio of
the focal length to the diameter of the lens opening.
The human eye also adjusts for the available light—by
opening and closing the iris. It focuses not by moving the lens,
but by adjusting the shape of the lens to vary its focal length.
The image is formed on the retina, which contains an array of
receptors known as rods and cones.
Diverging eyeglass or contact lenses are used to correct
