m by 
modeling inquiry as they work through their experimental design. Before students begin 
the lab, you can ask them about the structure of their investigation. Discuss the following 
terms: 
•  Hypothesis: The simplest form of a hypothesis is an If … then format. Ask students 
what they are trying to determine with their experiment, and how they will know 
if their hypothesis is supported. For example, We know that tomatoes are fruits, that 
many fruits produce ethylene, and that ethylene promotes fruit ripening. If tomatoes 
produce ethylene, then placing them in a container that traps ethylene will cause the 
tomatoes to ripen faster. 
•  Procedure: Ask students for the reason behind the lab setup. Have them explain 
how their procedure will answer the question posed by their hypothesis. Questions 
to consider include What kind of information will the procedure give? How will the 
information be provided? What about reproducibility? Are enough trials being done 
to have confidenc
