As in a refrigerator, there is an indoor and an outdoor heat exchanger (coils of the
refrigerator) and an electric compressor motor. The operating principle is like
that for a refrigerator or air conditioner; but the objective of a heat pump is to heat
(deliver 
), rather than to cool (remove 
). Thus, the coefficient of performance
of a heat pump is defined differently than for an air conditioner because it is the
heat 
delivered to the inside of the house that is important now:

The COP is necessarily greater than 1. Typical heat pumps today have 
to 3. Most heat pumps can be “turned around” and used as air conditioners in the
summer.

EXERCISE F The heat pump of Example 15–12 uses 1500 W of electric power to deliver
4500 W of heat. Does this sound like we’re getting something for nothing? (a) Explain
