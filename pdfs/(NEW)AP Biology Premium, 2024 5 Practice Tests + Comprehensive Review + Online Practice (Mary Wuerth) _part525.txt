 a food chain.
Figure 22.1 A Food Chain
Most organisms do not rely on just one food source and are part of multiple food chains. Food webs show the
interconnections between organisms in different food chains and provide a more complete representation of energy
transfers in ecosystems than food chains. Figure 22.2 provides an example of a food web.

Autotrophs (producers) get energy from physical or chemical sources in their environment. Photoautotrophs
get energy from sunlight. Plants are photoautotrophs. Chemoautotrophs obtain energy from small inorganic
molecules in their environment. Most chemoautotrophs are bacteria found in extreme environments, such as deep-
sea thermal vents or geothermal geysers.
Heterotrophs get energy from carbon compounds made by other organisms. Heterotrophs can obtain energy
from carbohydrates, lipids, or proteins by breaking down these macromolecules using hydrolysis reactions. Animals
are heterotrophs.
Decomposers break down dead or
