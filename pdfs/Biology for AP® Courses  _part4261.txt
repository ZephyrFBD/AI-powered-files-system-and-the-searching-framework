Documented Results of Climate Change: Past and Present
Scientists have geological evidence of the consequences of long-ago climate change. Modern-day phenomena such as
retreating glaciers and melting polar ice cause a continual rise in sea level. Meanwhile, changes in climate can negatively
affect organisms.
Geological Climate Change
Global warming has been associated with at least one planet-wide extinction event during the geological past. The Permian
extinction event occurred about 251 million years ago toward the end of the roughly 50-million-year-long geological time
span known as the Permian period. This geologic time period was one of the three warmest periods in Earth’s geologic
history. Scientists estimate that approximately 70 percent of the terrestria
