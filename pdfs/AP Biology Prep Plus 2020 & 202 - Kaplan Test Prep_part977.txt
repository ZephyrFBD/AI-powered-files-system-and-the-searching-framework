Here is one possible response that would earn full credit:
A control treatment for the experiment would be to use the respirator to
measure oxygen consumption of glass beads in place of seeds over time.
This control would show the amount of carbon dioxide in the container
that is decreasing because of KOH, which absorbs carbon dioxide.
Subtracting these values from those measured from the non-germinating
and germinating seeds would give a more accurate value for oxygen
