ipids: form the bilayer; Carbohydrates:
function as adhesion; Cholesterol: provide
flexibility to the membrane, Integral proteins:
form transporters; Intermediate filaments: part of
the cellâ€™s recognition sites.
21. Discuss why the following affect the rate of diffusion:
molecular size, temperature, solution density, and the
distance that must be traveled.

a.
Larger molecules move faster than lighter
molecules. Temperature affects the molecular
movement. Density is directly proportional to
the molecular movement. Greater distance slows
the diffusion.
b.
Larger molecules move slower than lighter
molecules. Increasing or decreasing temperature
increases or decreases the energy in the medium,
affecting molecular movement. Density is
inversely proportional to molecular movement.
Greater distance slows the diffusion.
c.
Larger molecules move slower than lighter
molecules. Temperature does not affect the rate
of diffusion. Density is
