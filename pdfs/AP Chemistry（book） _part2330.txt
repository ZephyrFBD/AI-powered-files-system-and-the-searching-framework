ing the high-temperature behavior of ni-
trogen oxides is essential for controlling pollution 
generated in automobile engines. The decomposi-
tion of nitric oxide (NO) to N2 and O2 is second order 
with a rate constant of 0.0796 M -1s-1 at 737 °C and 
0.0815 M -1s-1 at 947 °C. Calculate the activation en-
ergy for the reaction.
