curves we have been studying 
were either perfectly straight lines or else made up of straight-line segments. In most 
real situations, however, we cannot do this because the slope of the progress curve does 
not change sharply at a given time, but, gradually, over a period of time. You probably 
remember how to measure the slope of a curved line, but let us review the process 
anyway. (See Figure A.14.)

Suppose we want to measure the slope, or steepness, of the curved line C at time 2 hours. 
We can see that the curve rises 5 units total in the 2 hours, so that the average slope is 
2.5 units per hour. However, it is easy to see from the graph that this average is very 
misleading; the progress curve is almost flat at the beginning (i.e., has 0 slope) and then 
accelerates rapidly, so that the line curves upward. If we want to find the true slope at 2 
hours, we must draw line L in such a way tha
