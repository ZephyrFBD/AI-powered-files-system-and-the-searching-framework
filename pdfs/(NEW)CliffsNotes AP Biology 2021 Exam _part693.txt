t in its particular habitat because, of all other species in the community, it is
best able to compete for resources or escape predators or disease.
2. A keystone species is one that has a strong influence on the health of a community or ecosystem. Removal of a
keystone species results in dramatic changes in the makeup of species that comprise other trophic levels.
Sea otters, a keystone species, eat sea urchins and sea urchins eat kelp. When otter population size drops along the
Pacific coast of North America due to excessive hunting (by humans) or predation (by killer whales), the number of
urchins increases dramatically. In turn, kelp populations plummet, and the fish and marine invertebrates that lived in
the kelp beds disappear.
The grey wolf, a keystone species, eats elk, deer, coyotes, and other large mammals. Because of threats to livestock,
wolves were hunted to extinction in most U.S. states. In their absence, elk and deer populations exploded, vegetation
was overgrazed, and
