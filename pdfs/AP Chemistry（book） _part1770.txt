ht as pressure increases for most 
substances because the solid form is denser than the liquid form. An increase in 
pressure usually favors the more compact solid phase; thus, higher temperatures 
are required to melt the solid at higher pressures. The melting point at 1 atm is the 
normal melting point.
Point T, where the three curves intersect, is the triple point, and here all three 
phases are in equilibrium. Any other point on any of the three curves represents equi-
librium between two phases. Any point on the diagram that does not fall on one of the 
curves corresponds to conditions under which only one phase is present. The gas phase, 
for example, is stable at low pressures and high temperatures, whereas the solid phase is 
stable at low temperatures and high pressures. Liquids are stable in the region between 
the other two.

Figure 11.28 shows the phase diagram of H2O. Because of the large range of pressures cov-
