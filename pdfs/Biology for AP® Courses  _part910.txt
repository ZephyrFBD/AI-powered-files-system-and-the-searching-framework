e Light-Dependent Reaction of Photosynthesis
8.3: Using Light to Make Organic Molecules
Introduction
All biological processes require energy. To get this energy, many organisms access stored energy by eating, that is, by
ingesting other organisms. But where does the stored energy in food originate? Almost all of this energy can be traced back
to photosynthesis.
Photosynthetic organisms are the basis for almost all of the food webs on the planet. For example, the Indian River Lagoon,
a 156 mile mixture of fresh and salt water along the eastern coast of Florida, depends on its sea grass for the survival of
its marine life. Unfortunately, when certain algal phytoplankton species grow in overabundance, it destroys the sea grass.
Scientists conducted a 16 year study of algal blooms and found that extreme climate conditions, such as cold weather and
low rainfall, change which particular species of phytoplankton is more likely to bloom, resulting in a die-off of sea grass,
