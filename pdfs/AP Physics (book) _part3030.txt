a particle. Light can act like a wave or
like a particle

de Broglie wavelength
Wavelength of a ball. Calculate the de Broglie wavelength
of a 0.20-kg ball moving with a speed of 
APPROACH We use Eq. 27–8.
SOLUTION
Ordinary objects, such as the ball of Example 27–10, have unimaginably small
wavelengths. Even if the speed is extremely small, say 
the wavelength
would be about 
Indeed, the wavelength of any ordinary object is much
too small to be measured and detected. The problem is that the properties of
waves, such as interference and diffraction, are significant only when the size of
objects or slits is not much larger than the wavelength. And there are no known
objects or slits to diffract waves only 
long, so the wave properties of
ordinary objects go undetected.
But tiny elementary
