rably cold or hot stimulus can quickly progress to a much more intense
stimulus that is no longer tolerable. Any stimulus that is too intense can be perceived as pain because temperature sensations
are conducted along the same pathways that carry pain sensations
Pain
Pain is the name given to nociception, which is the neural processing of injurious stimuli in response to tissue damage. Pain
is caused by true sources of injury, such as contact with a heat source that causes a thermal burn or contact with a corrosive
chemical. But pain also can be caused by harmless stimuli that mimic the action of damaging stimuli, such as contact with
capsaicins, the compounds that cause peppers to taste hot and which are used in self-defense pepper sprays and certain
topical medications. Peppers taste “hot” because the protein receptors that bind capsaicin open the same calcium channels
that are activated by warm receptors.
Nociception starts at the sensory receptors, but pain, in-as-much as it is the
