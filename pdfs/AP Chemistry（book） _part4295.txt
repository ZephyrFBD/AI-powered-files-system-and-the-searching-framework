educe or refine 
metals. (Section 20.9)
electromotive force (emf) A measure of the driving force, or 
electrical pressure, for the completion of an electrochemical 
reaction. Electromotive force is measured in volts: 1 V = 1 J>C. 
Also called the cell potential. (Section 20.4)
electron A negatively charged subatomic particle found outside 
the atomic nucleus; it is a part of all atoms. (Section 2.2)
electron affinity The energy change that occurs when an 
electron is added to a gaseous atom or ion. (Section 7.5)
electron capture A mode of radioactive decay in which an inner-
shell orbital electron is captured by the nucleus. (Section 21.1)
electron configuration The arrangement of electrons in the 
orbitals of an atom or molecule (Section 6.8)
electron density The probability of finding an electron at any 
particular point in an atom; this probability is equal to c2, the 
square of the wave function. Also called the probability density.
