individual’s position is independent of the locations of other
individuals; for example, the dispersal of a plant’s seeds by wind may result in the random
location of the plant’s offspring.
iii. Clumped distribution pattern—the most common with most organisms in the population preferring
to aggregate in the same area(s).
Clumping can result from uneven distribution of the resources needed by the population’s
members.
Clumping can also be the result of social behaviors that lead to swarming, flocking, or
schooling among animals.
Dispersion Patterns
4. The age structure of a population is dynamic and changes over time due to varying birth rates, death
rates, and life expectancies.
i.
A population with a greater number of younger, reproductively active members is expected to
increase in size more rapidly than a population with fewer young individuals.
ii. If life expectancy increases, the number of older members in a population is expected to increase.
