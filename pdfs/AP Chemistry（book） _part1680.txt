 ideal behavior.
 10.90  The planet Jupiter has a surface temperature of 140 K and a 
mass 318 times that of Earth. Mercury (the planet) has a sur-
face temperature between 600 K and 700 K and a mass 0.05 
times that of Earth. On which planet is the atmosphere 
more likely to obey the ideal-gas law? Explain.
 
10.91 Which statement concerning the van der Waals constants a 
and b is true?
(a) The magnitude of a relates to molecular volume, 
whereas b relates to attractions between molecules.
(b) The magnitude of a relates to attractions between 
molecules, whereas b relates to molecular volume.
(c) The magnitudes of a and b depend on pressure.
(d) The magnitudes of a and b depend on temperature.
 
10.92 Based on their respective van der Waals constants 
( 
Table 10.3), is Ar or CO2 expected to behave more nearly 
like an ideal gas at high pressures?
 
10.93 In Sample Exercise 10.16, we found that one mole of Cl2 
confined to 22.41 L at 0 °C deviated slightly from ideal 
behavior. Calcul
