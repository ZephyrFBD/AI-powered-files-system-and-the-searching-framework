ociate O2.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
The bond dissociation energy of the Br¬ Br bond is 
193 kJ>mol. What wavelength of light has just enough  
energy to cause Br¬Br bond dissociation?
(a) 620 nm (b) 310 nm (c) 148 nm (d) 6200 nm (e) 563 nm
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
The bond energy in N2 is 941 kJ>mol. What is the longest 
wavelength a photon can have and still have sufficient  
energy to dissociate N2?
l = c
n = a
3.00 * 108 m>s
1.24 * 1015>s
b a 109 nm
1 m
b = 242 nm
n = E
h =
8.22 * 10-19 J
6.626 * 10-34 J@s
= 1.24 * 1015  s-1
We next use the Planck relationship, E = hn, 
 (Equation 6.2) 
to calculate the frequency n of a photon that has this amount of 
energy:
Finally, we use the relationship between frequency and wave-
length 
 (Section 6.1) to calculate the wavelength of the light:
Give It Some Thought
Does photoionization lead to the formation of a cation or an anion? Does 
photoionization lead to bond breaking?
