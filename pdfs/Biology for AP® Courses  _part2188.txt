4. What is the difference between micro and
macroevolution?
a.
Microevolution describes the evolution of small
organisms, such as insects, while
macroevolution describes the evolution of large
organisms, like people and elephants.
b.
Microevolution describes the evolution of
microscopic entities, such as molecules and
proteins, while macroevolution describes the
evolution of whole organisms.
c.
Microevolution describes the evolution of
organisms in populations, while macroevolution
describes the evolution of species over long
periods of time.
d.
Microevolution describes the evolution of
organisms over their lifetimes, while
macroevolution describes the evolution of
organisms over multiple generations.
