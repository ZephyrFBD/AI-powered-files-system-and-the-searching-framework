n DNA Learning Center of 
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, provides extensive background and procedural 
information for multiple transformation laboratory exercises. All of the plasmids 
described in the resource contain the gene for ampicillin resistance, and all of the 
experimental procedures use ampicillin to select transformed cells. Several of the 
plasmids contain an additional marker gene that causes the transformed cell to be 
colored, including pVIB, pGREEN, and pBLU.

Plasmid isolation and purification are fairly simple processes that students might want 
to try. Chemicals, bacterial strains, culture media, and other supplies can be purchased 
from several commercial companies, including Carolina Biological (http://www.
carolina.com
 
) and Bio-Rad (http://explorer.bio-rad.com). Students can isolate 
specific plasmids of your choice and use them to transform bacteria that do not naturally 
contain the plasmid(s). Using the skills a
