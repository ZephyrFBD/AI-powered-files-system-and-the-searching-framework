 
being at best the ambient temperature of water or air. The
second law of thermodynamics tells us the limit imposed by nature. Even alterna-
tive energy sources like wind and solar cells can contribute to global warming
(windmills slow down cooling winds, solar cells are “dark” and absorb more of the
incident energy). What we can do, in light of the second law of thermodynamics, is
use less energy and conserve our fuel resources. There is no other solution.
