By now, students should be accustomed to 
using visual models and representations to 
explain or illustrate biological processes. This 
unit provides students the opportunity to 
gain proficiency in describing a given model 
or representation and communicating the 
biological meaning it represents. Mastery 
is demonstrated when students can create 
or use models such as cladograms and 
phylogenetic trees to communicate biological 
phenomena, analyze situations, or solve 
newÂ problems.
Hardy-Weinberg equations are used with 
respect to a specific gene. Thus, when 
teaching students how to use the equations, 
be careful to distinguish between allele and 
genotype frequencies. The Hardy-Weinberg 
principle clarifies the factors that alter allele 
frequency, but it does not imply that allele 
frequencies are static. This is an important 
understanding that students need in order 
to make predictions about a change in a 
population and
