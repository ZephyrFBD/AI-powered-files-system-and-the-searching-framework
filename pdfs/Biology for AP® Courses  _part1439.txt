none of the tools that the geneticists of today routinely employ. One such powerful cytological technique
is karyotyping, a method in which traits characterized by chromosomal abnormalities can be identified
from a single cell. To observe an individual’s karyotype, a person’s cells (like white blood cells) are first
collected from a blood sample or other tissue. In the laboratory, the isolated cells are stimulated to begin
actively dividing. A chemical called colchicine is then applied to cells to arrest condensed chromosomes
in metaphase. Cells are then made to swell using a hypotonic solution so the chromosomes spread apart.
Finally, the sample is preserved in a fixative and applied to a slide.
The geneticist then stains chromosomes with one of several dyes to better visualize the distinct and
reproducible banding patterns of each chromosome pair. Following staining, the chromosomes are viewed
using bright-field microscopy. A common stain choice is the Giemsa stain. Giems
