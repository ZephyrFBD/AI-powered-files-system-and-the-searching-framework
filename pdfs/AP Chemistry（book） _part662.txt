1OH22 solution? 
 
(b) How many milliliters of 0.125 M H2SO4 are needed to 
neutralize 0.200 g of NaOH? (c) If 55.8 mL of a BaCl2 solution 
is needed to precipitate all the sulfate ion in a 752-mg sam-
ple of Na2SO4, what is the molarity of the BaCl2 solution? 
 
(d) If 42.7 mL of 0.208 M HCl solution is needed to neutralize 
a solution of Ca1OH22, how many grams of Ca1OH22 must be 
in the solution?
 4.83 Some sulfuric acid is spilled on a lab bench. You can neutral-
ize the acid by sprinkling sodium bicarbonate on it and then 
mopping up the resulting solution. The sodium bicarbonate 
reacts with sulfuric acid according to:
2 NaHCO31s2 + H2SO41aq2 ยก Na2SO41aq2 +  
2 H2O1l2 + 2 CO21g2
 
 Sodium bicarbonate is added until the fizzing due to the for-
mation of CO21g2 stops. If 27 mL of 6.0 M H2SO4 was spilled, 
what is the minimum mass of NaHCO3 that must be added 
to the spill to neutralize the acid?
 4.84 The distinctive odor of vinegar is due to acetic acid, CH3COOH, 
which reacts wit
