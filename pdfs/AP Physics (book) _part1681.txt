eat engines, we usually consider the heat intake,
the heat exhausted, and the work done as positive.
3. Watch the units used for work and heat; work is most
often expressed in joules, and heat can be in calories,
kilocalories, or joules. Be consistent: choose only one
unit for use throughout a given problem.
MisConceptual Questions

1. In an isothermal process, 3700 J of work is done by an ideal
gas. Is this enough information to tell how much heat has
been added to the system? If so, how much? If not, why not?
2. Can mechanical energy ever be transformed completely
into heat or internal energy? Can the reverse happen? In
each case, if your answer is no, explain why not; if yes,
give one or two examples.
3. Can the temperature of a system remain constant even
though heat flows into or out of it? If so, give examples.
4. Explain why the temperature of a gas increases when it is
compressed adiabatically.
5. An ideal monatomic gas expands slowly to twice its volume
(1) isothermally; (2
