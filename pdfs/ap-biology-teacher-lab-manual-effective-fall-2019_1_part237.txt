 needed to test for either AB or BA. 
In cell I5, enter the nested function: 
=IF(G5=“
AB”
,1,(IF(G5=“BA”
,1,0))). 
This example requires an extra set of parentheses, which is necessary to nest functions. 
This function basically says that if the value in cell G5 is exactly equal to AB, then put a 
1; if not, then if the value in cell G5 is exactly BA, put a 1; if it is neither, then put a 0 in 
this cell. Copy these three formulas down for all the rows in which you have produced 
gametes. 
Enter the labels for the columns you’ve been working on — gametes in cell E4, zygote 
in cell G5, AA in cell H4, AB in cell I4, and BB in cell J4, as shown in Figure 7 on the 
next page.

As before, try recalculating a number of times to make sure everything is working 
as expected. What is expected? If you aren’t sure yet, keep this question in mind as you 
complete the sheet. You could use a p value of 0.5, and then you’d see numbers similar to
