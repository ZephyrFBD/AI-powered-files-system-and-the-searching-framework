um in any reference frame.
Einstein’s theory required us to give up common sense notions of space and
time, and in the following Sections we will examine some strange but interesting con-
sequences of special relativity. Our arguments for the most part will be simple ones.

CHAPTER 26
The Special Theory of Relativity
†The Michelson–Morley experiment can also be considered as evidence for the first postulate, since it
was intended to measure the motion of the Earth relative to an absolute reference frame. Its failure
to do so implies the absence of any such preferred frame.

We will use a technique that Einstein himself did: we will imagine very simple
experimental situations in which little mathematics is needed. In this way, we can
see many of the consequences of relativity theory without getting involved in
detailed calculations. Einstein called these thought experiments.
