 4.12 You are titrating an acidic solution with a basic one, and just 
realized you forgot to add the indicator that tells you when 
the equivalence point is reached. In this titration, the indi-
cator turns blue at the equivalence point from an initially 
colorless solution. You quickly grab a bottle of indicator and 
add some to your titration beaker, and the whole solution 
turns dark blue. What do you do now? [Section 4.6]

CHAPTER 4 Reactions in Aqueous Solution
 4.19 Formic acid, HCOOH, is a weak electrolyte. What solutes are 
present in an aqueous solution of this compound? Write the 
chemical equation for the ionization of HCOOH.
 4.20 Acetone, CH3COCH3, is a nonelectrolyte; hypochlorous 
acid, HClO, is a weak electrolyte; and ammonium chloride, 
NH4Cl, is a strong electrolyte. (a) What are the solutes pres-
ent in aqueous solutions of each compound? (b) If 0.1 mol of 
each compound is dissolved in solution, which one contains 
0.2 mol of solute particles, which contai
