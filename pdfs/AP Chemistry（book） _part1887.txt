d. Upon moving past the middle elements of the transition metal 
series, the bonds grow weaker as electrons populate antibonding orbitals. Strong bonds 
between atoms lead to metals with higher melting and boiling points, higher heats of 
fusion, higher hardness, and so forth.
Give It Some Thought
Which element, W or Au, has the greater number of electrons in antibonding 
orbitals? Which one would you expect to have the higher melting point?
12.5 ∣ Ionic Solids
Ionic solids are held together by the electrostatic attraction between cations and 
anions: ionic bonds.
 (Section 8.2) The high melting and boiling points of ionic 
compounds are a testament to the strength of the ionic bonds. The strength of an ionic 
bond depends on the charges and sizes of the ions. As discussed in Chapters 8 and 11, the 
attractions between cations and anions increase as the charges of the ions increase. Thus 
NaCl, where the ions have charges of 1+ and 1-, melts at 801 °C, whereas MgO, where 
the ions have
