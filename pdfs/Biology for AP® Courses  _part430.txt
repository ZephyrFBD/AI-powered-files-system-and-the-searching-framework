nt example of form following function. People with celiac disease have an immune
response to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The immune response damages microvilli, and thus,
afflicted individuals cannot absorb nutrients. This leads to malnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea. Patients suffering from
celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet.
Figure 4.10 Microvilli, shown here as they appear on cells lining the small intestine, increase the surface area available
for absorption. These microvilli are only found on the area of the plasma membrane that faces the cavity from which
substances will be absorbed. (credit "micrograph": modification of work by Louisa Howard)
The Cytoplasm
The cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope (a structure to be
discussed shortly). It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel-like cytosol, the cytoskeleton, and various chemicals
(Figure 4.8). Even though the cytoplasm cons
