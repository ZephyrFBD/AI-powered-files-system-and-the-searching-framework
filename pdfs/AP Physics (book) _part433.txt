the truck?
41. (II) A 2.0-kg silverware drawer does not slide readily. The
owner gradually pulls with more and more force, and when
the applied force reaches 9.0 N, the drawer suddenly opens,
throwing all the utensils to the floor. What is the coefficient
of static friction between the drawer and the cabinet?
42. (II) A box is given a push so that it slides across the floor.
How far will it go, given that the coefficient of kinetic fric-
tion is 0.15 and the push imparts an initial speed of 
43. (II) A 1280-kg car pulls a 350-kg trailer. The car exerts a
horizontal force of 
against the ground in order
to accelerate. What force does the car exert on the trailer?
Assume an effective friction coefficient of 0.15 for the trailer.
44. (II) Police investigators, examining the scene of an accident
involving two cars, measure 72-m-long skid marks of one
of the cars, which nearly came to a stop before colliding.
The coefficient of kinetic friction between rubber and the
pavement is about 0.80.
