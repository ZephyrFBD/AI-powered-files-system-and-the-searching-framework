teractions, can
be explained almost solely in terms of genetics and natural selection. This science is controversial; noted scientists such
as the late Stephen Jay Gould criticized the approach for ignoring the environmental effects on behavior. This is another
example of the “nature versus nurture” debate of the role of genetics versus the role of environment in determining an
organism’s characteristics.
Sociobiology also links genes with behaviors and has been associated with “biological determinism,” the belief that all
behaviors are hardwired into our genes. No one disputes that certain behaviors can be inherited and that natural selection
plays a role retaining them. It is the application of such principles to human behavior that sparks this controversy, which
remains active today.
