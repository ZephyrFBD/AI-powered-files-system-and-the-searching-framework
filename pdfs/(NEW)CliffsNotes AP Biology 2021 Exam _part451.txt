immediately
reproductively isolated from individuals with chromosome numbers like its parents. Though rare in animals,
polyploidy is common in plants.
Another source of reproductive isolation can occur when the habitats of two different species meet. In the zone
where the two populations meet and overlap, some individuals may mate because of incomplete prezygotic or
postzygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms. If the hybrids that form are better adapted to the features of the
hybrid zone than either of the parent populations, then successful mating among the hybrids may result in a
population that is isolated from either parent population.
A third source of reproductive isolation can result when a population maintains a balanced polymorphism. A
balanced polymorphism occurs when multiple forms of a trait are maintained in the population at frequencies higher
than would be expected from random mating. In these cases, one or more of the forms possesses an adaptation that
has a greater s
