In nonwalled cells, such as animal cells, the movement of water into and out of a cell 
is affected by the relative solute concentration on either side of the plasma membrane. 
As water moves out of the cell, the cell shrinks; if water moves into the cell, it swells and 
may eventually burst. In walled cells, including fungal and plant cells, osmosis is affected 
not only by the solute concentration, but also by the resistance to water movement in 
the cell by the cell wall. This resistance is called turgor pressure. The presence of a cell 
wall prevents the cells from bursting as water enters; however, pressure builds up inside 
the cell and affects the rate of osmosis. 
Water movement in plants is important in water transport from the roots into the 
shoots and leaves. You likely will explore this specialized movement called transpiration 
in another lab investigation.
