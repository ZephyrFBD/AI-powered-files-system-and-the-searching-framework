ere 
are 
three 
classes 
of 
carbohydrates 
you 
should 
know:
monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.
Monosaccharides have a chemical formula of C6H12O6. Three
examples are glucose, galactose, and fructose, which are isomers of each
other. The structural formula of glucose is shown in Figure 2.5. Notice the
conventional numbering of the carbons in the rings. The numbering begins
to the right of the oxygen.

Disaccharides have the chemical formula C12H22O11. They consist of
two monosaccharides joined together, with the release of one molecule of
water, by the process known as dehydration synthesis or condensation.
Here are the three condensation reactions of monosaccharides that produce
the three disaccharides.
