se to low blood Ca2+ levels. PTH increases Ca2+ levels by targeting
the skeleton, the kidneys, and the intestine. In the skeleton, PTH stimulates osteoclasts, which causes bone to be reabsorbed,
releasing Ca2+ from bone into the blood. PTH also inhibits osteoblasts, reducing Ca2+ deposition in bone. In the intestines,
PTH increases dietary Ca2+ absorption, and in the kidneys, PTH stimulates reabsorption of the CA2+. While PTH acts
directly on the kidneys to increase Ca2+ reabsorption, its effects on the intestine are indirect. PTH triggers the formation of
calcitriol, an active form of vitamin D, which acts on the intestines to increase absorption of dietary calcium. PTH release
is inhibited by rising blood calcium levels.

calcium levels by targeting the skeleton, the kidneys, and the intestine. (credit: modification of work by Mikael
