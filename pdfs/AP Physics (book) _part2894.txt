d by the coin is different
as viewed from different frames of reference. This does not violate the relativity
principle because this principle states that the laws of physics are the same in 
all inertial frames. The same law of gravity, and the same laws of motion, apply in
both reference frames. The acceleration of the coin is the same in both reference
frames. The difference in Figs. 26–2a and b is that in the Earth’s frame of reference,
the coin has an initial velocity (equal to that of the car). The laws of physics there-
fore predict it will follow a parabolic path like any projectile (Chapter 3). In the
car’s reference frame, there is no initial velocity, and the laws of physics predict
that the coin will fall straight down. The laws are the same in both reference frames,
although the specific paths are different.
Galilean–Newtonian relativity involves certain unprovable assumptions that
make sense from everyday experience. It is assumed that the lengths of objects
are the same
