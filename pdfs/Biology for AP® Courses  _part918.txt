The importance of photosynthesis is not just that it can capture sunlight’s energy. A lizard sunning itself on a cold day can
use the sun’s energy to warm up. Photosynthesis is vital because it evolved as a way to store the energy in solar radiation (the
“photo-” part) as energy in the carbon-carbon bonds of carbohydrate molecules (the “-synthesis” part). Those carbohydrates
are the energy source that heterotrophs use to power the synthesis of ATP via respiration. Therefore, photosynthesis powers
99 percent of Earth’s ecosystems. When a top predator, such as a wolf, preys on a deer (Figure 8.3), the wolf is at the end of
an energy path that went from nuclear reactions on the surface of the sun, to light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to deer,
and finally to wolf.
