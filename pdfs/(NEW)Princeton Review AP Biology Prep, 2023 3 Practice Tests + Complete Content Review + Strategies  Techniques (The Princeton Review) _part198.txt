y of phospholipids, small, lipid-soluble substances—such as N2,
O2, and CO2— cross the membrane without any resistance. Why? Because “like dissolves like.” The lipid bilayer is
a hydrophobic sandwich (hydrophilic outside and hydrophobic interior), and only hydrophobic things can pass that
central zone. If a substance is hydrophilic, the bilayer won’t let it pass without assistance, called facilitated
transport.
Homeostasis
Moving things across membranes is important for growth and homeostasis.
Osmoregulation is the movement of water and solute across membranes to
maintain homeostasis.
Facilitated transport depends upon a number of proteins that act as tunnels through the membrane. Channels are very
specialized types of tunnels that let only certain things through.
The most famous of these are aquaporins, which are water-specific channels. Although water is polar, there are
typically sufficient aquaporins for water to traverse the membrane whenever it wishes without forming traffic jams
