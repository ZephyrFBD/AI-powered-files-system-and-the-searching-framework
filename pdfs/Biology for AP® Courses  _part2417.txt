 and
reproduces which could interfere with cell
processes.
c.
Because it attacks the immune system of the host
cell, which would in turn interfere with cell
processes.
d.
Because it replicates its protein within the cell
and reproduces, which could interfere with cell
processes.
46. The diagrams below model the lytic and lysogenic
reproductive cycles of viruses. Which cycle would
maintain the DNA of the virus over several generations,
and why?
a.
Lysogenic, because the viral DNA can be
excised from the host cell’s DNA when under
stress.
b.
Lytic, because the viral DNA can be excised
from the host cell’s DNA when under stress.
c.
Lytic, because the viral DNA can be passed on
when the host cell replicates.
d.
Lysogenic, because the viral DNA can be passed
on when the host cell replicates.
47. The diagrams below model the lytic and lysogenic
reproductive cycles of viruses. Based on the diagram,
identify whether the following statement is true or false,
and explain why or why not: “The lys
