Your calculated χ2 must be greater than the corresponding p value
in the table for the outcome to be significantly diﬀerent than what
you expected.
Part 3 of the lab asks you to explore the diﬀerences between normal cells
and cancer cells. Remember that cancer typically results from a mutation
in a gene or protein that controls the cell cycle. Comparing pictures of
chromosomes from normal and HeLa cells, you will be able to count the
number of chromosomes found in each type of cell and identify
diﬀerences in appearance. The main conclusion to draw from this part of
the investigation is that in normal cells, division is blocked if there is
damage to or mutations in DNA. In contrast, this ability to block division
is lacking in cancer cells, and they divide uncontrollably.
Finally, you will review meiosis and nondisjunction events by modeling.
Based on this review, you will measure crossover frequencies and genetic
outcomes in a fungus. This part of the investigatio
