Although there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in recent years, doctors are still confounded by some
diseases, and they are using whole-genome sequencing to get to the bottom of the problem. Whole-genome sequencing is
a process that determines the DNA sequence of an entire genome. Whole-genome sequencing is a brute-force approach to
problem solving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease. Several laboratories now provide services to sequence,
analyze, an
