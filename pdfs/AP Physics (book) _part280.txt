CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 3;7
Level Horizontal Range
The total distance the football traveled in Example 3–6 is called the horizontal
range R. We now derive a formula for the range, which applies to a projectile that
lands at the same level it started 
: that is,
(see Fig. 3–25a).
Looking back at Example 3–6 part (c), we see that
where (from
part b)
Thus

and
This can be rewritten, using the trigon-
ometric identity
(Appendix A or inside the rear cover):

Note that the maximum range, for a given initial velocity 
is obtained when
takes on its maximum value of 1.0, which occurs for
so
The maximum range increases by the square of 
so doubling the muzzle velocity
of a cannon increases its maximum range by a factor of 4.
When air resistance is important, the range is less for a given 
and the maxi-
mum range is obtained at an angle smaller than 45°.
