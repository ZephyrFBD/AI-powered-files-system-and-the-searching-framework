food webs and their constituent food chains. Food webs illustrate how energy flows directionally through
ecosystems, including how efficiently organisms acquire it, use it, and how much remains for use by other organisms of the
food web.
How Organisms Acquire Energy in a Food Web
Energy is acquired by living things in three ways: photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, and the consumption and digestion of
other living or previously living organisms by heterotrophs.
Photosynthetic and chemosynthetic organisms are both grouped into a category known as autotrophs: organisms capable
of synthesizing their own food (more specifically, capable of using inorganic carbon as a carbon source). Photosynthetic
autotrophs (photoautotrophs) use sunlight as an energy source, whereas chemosynthetic autotrophs (chemoautotrophs) use
inorganic molecules as an energy source. Autotrophs are critical for all ecosystems. Without these organisms, energy would
not be available to other living organisms and life itself
