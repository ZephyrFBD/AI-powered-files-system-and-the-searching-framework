ach of which plays a critical role during the process.
One of the key players is the enzyme DNA polymerase, also known as DNA pol, which adds nucleotides one by one to the
growing DNA chain that are complementary to the template strand. The addition of nucleotides requires energy; this energy
is obtained from the nucleotides that have three phosphates attached to them, similar to ATP which has three phosphate
groups attached. When the bond between the phosphates is broken, the energy released is used to form the phosphodiester
bond between the incoming nucleotide and the growing chain. In prokaryotes, three main types of polymerases are known:
DNA pol I, DNA pol II, and DNA pol III. It is now known that DNA pol III is the enzyme required for DNA synthesis;
DNA pol I and DNA pol II are primarily required for repair.
How does the replication machinery know where to begin? It turns out that there are specific nucleotide sequences called
origins of replication where replication begins. In
