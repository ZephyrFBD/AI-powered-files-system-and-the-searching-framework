ectron normally on the H atom of adenine (upper part of 
Fig. 16–39b) spends some of its time orbiting the adjacent N atom (more on this
in Chapter 29), so the N has a net negative charge and the H is left with a net positive
charge. This 
atom of adenine is then attracted to the 
atom of thymine.
These net 
and 
charges usually have magnitudes of a fraction of e (charge on
the electron) such as 0.2e or 0.4e. (This is what we mean by “polar” molecules.)
[When 
is involved, the weak bond it can make with a nearby negative
charge, such as 
is relatively strong (partly because 
is so small) and is
referred to as a hydrogen bond (Section 29–3).]
When the DNA replicates (duplicates) itself just before cell division, the
arrangement of A opposite T and G opposite C is crucial for ensuring that the
genetic information is passed on accurately to the next generation, Fig. 16–40.
The two strands of DNA separate (with the help of enzymes, which also operate
via the electrostatic force), leaving t
