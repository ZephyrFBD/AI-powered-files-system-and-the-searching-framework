g from element 80 to element 81 puts us into the 
p block in the 6p subshell. (Remember that the principal 
quantum number in the p block is the same as that in the s 
block.) Moving across to Bi requires three electrons: 6p3. The 
path we have taken is Putting the parts together, we obtain 
the condensed electron configuration: 3Xe46s24f 145d106p3.  
This configuration can also be written with the subshells 
arranged in order of increasing principal quantum number: 
3Xe44f 145d106s26p3.
Finally, we check our result to see if the number of 
electrons equals the atomic number of Bi, 83: Because 
Xe has 54 electrons (its atomic number), we have 
54 + 2 + 14 + 10 + 3 = 83. (If we had 14 electrons too few, 
we would realize that we have missed the f  block.)
