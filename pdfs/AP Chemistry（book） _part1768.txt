e vapor-pressure curve.
Solve The pressure equals 10.80 atm21760 torr>atm2 = 610 torr. 
From Figure 11.25 we see that the boiling point at this pressure is 
about 27 °C, which is close to room temperature.
Comment We can make a flask of diethyl ether boil at room tem-
perature by using a vacuum pump to lower the pressure above the 
liquid to about 0.8 atm.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
In the mountains, water in an open container will boil when
(a) its critical temperature exceeds room temperature.
(b) its vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure.
(c) its temperature is 100 °C.
(d) enough energy is supplied to break covalent bonds.
(e) none of these is correct.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Use Figure 11.25 to determine the external pressure if ethanol 
boils at 60 °C.
to the system or the pressure generated by the substance. The curves may be described 
as follows:
1. The red curve is the vapor-pressure curve of the liquid, representing equilibrium be-
tween the liquid and gas phases. The point o
