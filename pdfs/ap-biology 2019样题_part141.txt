 divide and transmit genetic 
information via two highly regulated processes.
IST-1.B.2
The cell cycle is a highly regulated series of 
events for the growth and reproduction of cells— 
a. The cell cycle consists of sequential stages 
of interphase (G1, S, G2), mitosis, and 
cytokinesis.
b. A cell can enter a stage (G0) where it no 
longer divides, but it can reenter the cell 
cycle in response to appropriate cues. 
Nondividing cells may exit the cell cycle or be 
held at a particular stage in the cell cycle.

Explain how mitosis results 
in the transmission of 
chromosomes from one 
generation to the next.
IST-1.C.1
Mitosis is a process that ensures the transfer 
of a complete genome from a parent cell to two 
genetically identical daughter cells—
a. Mitosis plays a role in growth, tissue repair, 
and asexual reproduction. 
b.  
Mitosis alternates with interphase in the 
cell cycle.
c. Mitosis occurs in a sequential series
