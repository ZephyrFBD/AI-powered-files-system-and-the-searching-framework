ock. Some scientists turn to genetics and to the principle of the molecular clock, which holds
that the more recently two species have diverged, the more similar their genes (and thus proteins) will be.
Conversely, species that diverged long ago will have more genes that are dissimilar.
Scientists at the NASA Astrobiology Institute and at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
collaborated to analyze the molecular evolution of 32 specific proteins common to 72 species of
prokaryotes.
[2] The model they derived from their data indicates that three important groups of
bacteria—Actinobacteria, Deinococcus, and Cyanobacteria (which the authors call Terrabacteria)—were
the first to colonize land. (Recall that Deinococcus is a genus of prokaryote—a bacterium—that is highly
resistant to ionizing radiation.) Cyanobacteria are photosynthesizers, while Actinobacteria are a group of
very common bacteria that include species important in decomposition of organic wastes.
