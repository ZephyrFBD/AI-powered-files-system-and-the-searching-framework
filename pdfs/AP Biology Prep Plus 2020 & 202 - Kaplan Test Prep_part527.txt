t the
foundation of the food web, (C). (A) is incorrect because energy flow
does not stop during periods of cold temperatures, but only
diminishes. (B) is incorrect because these events do not have an
impact on the energy levels in the biosphere. (D) is incorrect because
energy flow would not stop if most organisms were killed, but would
just be reduced.
4. C
Learning Objective: 12.1
Energy flows from the Sun to a producer, then to a consumer, then to
the breakdown of energy-rich carbohydrates by catabolism, and finally
to ATP supporting sliding filaments in the muscles. Energy is lost at
each step as heat dissipated to the surrounding environment. The
traditional way of representing this loss of energy is a pyramid, as in
(C). (A) is incorrect because some energy is dissipated into the
environment as heat with each step. (B) is incorrect because energy
does not circulate in this scenario. (D) is incorrect because energy does
not accumulate at each level, but diminishes since some is l
