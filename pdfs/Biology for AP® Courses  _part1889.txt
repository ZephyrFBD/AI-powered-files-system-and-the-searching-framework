ombination in any given area of the genome. Some parts of the genome are recombination
hotspots, whereas others do not show a propensity for recombination. For this reason, it is important to look at mapping
information developed by multiple methods.
Physical Maps
A physical map provides detail of the actual physical distance between genetic markers, as well as the number of
nucleotides. There are three methods used to create a physical map: cytogenetic mapping, radiation hybrid mapping, and
sequence mapping. Cytogenetic mapping uses information obtained by microscopic analysis of stained sections of the
chromosome (Figure 17.11). It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic
mapping, but not the exact distance (number of base pairs). Radiation hybrid mapping uses radiation, such as x-rays, to
break the DNA into fragments. The amount of radiation can be adjusted to create smaller or larger fragments. This technique
