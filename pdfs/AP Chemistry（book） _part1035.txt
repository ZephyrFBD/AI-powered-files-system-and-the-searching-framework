 6.79  The following do not represent valid ground-state elec-
tron configurations for an atom either because they violate 
the Pauli exclusion principle or because orbitals are not 
filled in order of increasing energy. Indicate which of these 
two principles is violated in each example. (a) 1s22s23s1,  
(b) 3Xe46s25d4 (c) 3Ne43s23d5.
 6.80  The following electron conﬁgurations represent excited states. 
Identify the element and write its ground-state condensed elec-
tron conﬁguration. (a) 1s22s22p43s1, (b) 3Ar44s13d104p25p1, 
(c) 3Kr45s24d25p1.

 6.81  Consider the two waves shown here, which we will consider 
to represent two electromagnetic radiations:
 
 (a) What is the wavelength of wave A? Of wave B?
 
 (b) What is the frequency of wave A? Of wave B?
 
 (c)  
Identify the regions of the electromagnetic
