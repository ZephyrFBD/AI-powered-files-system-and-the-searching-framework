ed would have 
to come from an inner shell of the sodium atom, and removing electrons from an 
inner shell requires a very large amount of energy. 
 (Section 7.4) The increase 
in lattice energy is not enough to compensate for the energy needed to remove an 
inner-shell electron. Thus, sodium and the other group 1A metals are found in ionic 
substances only as 1+ ions.
Similarly, adding electrons to nonmetals is either exothermic or only slightly 
endothermic as long as the electrons are added to the valence shell. Thus, a Cl atom 
easily adds an electron to form Cl-, which has the same electron configuration as Ar:
 Cl   1s22s22p63s23p5 = 3Ne43s23p5
 Cl-   
1s22s22p63s23p6 = 3Ne43s23p6 = 3Ar4
To form a Cl2 -  ion, the second electron would have to be added to the next higher 
shell of the Cl atom, an addition that is energetically very unfavorable. Therefore, we 
never observe Cl2 -  ions in ionic compounds. We thus expect ionic compounds of the 
representative metals from groups 1A,
