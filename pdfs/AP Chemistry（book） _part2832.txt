7.58  Calculate the solubility of LaF3 in grams per liter in (a) pure 
water, (b) 0.010 M KF solution, (c) 0.050 M LaCl3 solution.
 17.59  Consider a beaker containing a saturated solution of CaF2 
in equilibrium with undissolved CaF21s2. Solid CaCl2 is 
then added to the solution. (a) Will the amount of solid 
CaF2 at the bottom of the beaker increase, decrease, or re-
main the same? (b) Will the concentration of Ca2 +  ions in 
solution increase or decrease? (c) Will the concentration of 
F- ions in solution increase or decrease?
 17.60  Consider a beaker containing a saturated solution of PbI2 
in equilibrium with undissolved PbI21s2. Now solid KI is 
added to this solution. (a) Will the amount of solid PbI2 at 
the bottom of the beaker increase, decrease, or remain the 
same? (b) Will the concentration of Pb2 +  ions in solution 
increase or decrease? (c) Will the concentration of I- ions 
in solution increase or decrease?
