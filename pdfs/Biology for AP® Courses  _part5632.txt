food, drink, radiation, toxicity and other means.
Reality that we experience is nothing like reality as it really is in
the same way that the reality people experience in virtual reality
games is not the reality they are really living in. The game is only a
decoded source of information that appears to be a reality. Our
world is also an information construct – a simulation (more later). In
its base form our reality is a waveﬁeld of information much the same
in theme as Wi-Fi. The ﬁve senses decode waveﬁeld information into
electrical information which they communicate to the brain to
decode into holographic (illusory ‘physical’) information. Diﬀerent
parts of the brain specialise in decoding diﬀerent senses and the
information is fused into a reality that appears to be outside of us
but is really inside the brain and the genetic structure in general (Fig
