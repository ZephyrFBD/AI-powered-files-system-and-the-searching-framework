 nematic liquid crystal, the molecules are aligned so that their long axes tend 
to point in the same direction but the ends are not aligned with one another. In smec-
tic A and smectic C liquid crystals, the molecules maintain the long-axis alignment 
seen in nematic crystals, but in addition they pack into layers.
Two molecules that exhibit liquid crystalline phases are shown in Figure 11.33. 
The lengths of these molecules are much greater than their widths. The double 
bonds, including those in the benzene rings, add rigidity to the molecules, and the 
rings, because they are flat, help the molecules stack with one another. The polar 
—OCH3 and —COOH groups give rise to dipole–dipole interactions and promote 
alignment of the molecules. Thus, the molecules order themselves quite natu-
rally along their long axes. They can, however, rotate around their axes and slide 
parallel to one another. In smectic liquid crystals, the intermolecular forces (disper-
sion forces, dipole–dipole a
