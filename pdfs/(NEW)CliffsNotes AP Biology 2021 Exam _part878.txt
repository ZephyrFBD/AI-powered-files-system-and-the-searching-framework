hromatids.
25. C. Crossing over takes place during prophase of meiosis I, which occurs between figures III and IV.
 
A description of the process that occurs between each figure follows:
I to II: mycelial fusion and pairing of nuclei from each strain II to III: fusion of nuclei from each strain
III to IV: meiosis I
IV to V: meiosis II
V to VI: replication of second chromatid during “S” phase of cell cycle
 
VI to VII: mitosis
26. A. If no crossing over takes place, the arrangement of ascospores in the mature ascus will mirror the
arrangement of the chromatids bearing the spore color genes in III, except that each chromatid will produce two
(adjacent) spores. Such an ascus is illustrated in XI. But if B1 and T1 cross over, the ascus for VIII will be produced.
Ascus IX shows crossovers between B1 and T2, ascus XII shows crossovers between B2 and T1, and ascus X shows
crossovers between B2 and T2. Because each adjacent pair of ascospores consists of identical clones produced by
mitosis, t
