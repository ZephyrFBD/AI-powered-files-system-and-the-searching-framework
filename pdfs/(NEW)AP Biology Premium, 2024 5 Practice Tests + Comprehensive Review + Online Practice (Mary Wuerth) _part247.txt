torage of calcium in bones, and increased reabsorption of water by the kidneys would not
increase the energy available to cells.
3. (B) Small molecules pass between plant cells through channels called plasmodesmata, an example of juxtacrine
signaling. Choices (A) and (C) are incorrect because plant cells have a cell wall surrounding the cell membrane.
So molecules cannot pass through plant cell membranes unassisted nor can they bind to cell membrane
receptors unless they can pass through the cell wall first. Choice (D) is incorrect because not all ligands require
active transport.
4. (C) Growth factors bind to receptors, which triggers a signal transduction process that stimulates cell division.
Grouping cells together would not trigger cell division, so choice (A) is incorrect. Removing cyclic AMP from
the cytosol would most likely disrupt the signaling process that is required to trigger cell division, so choice (B)
is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because growth factors bind to
