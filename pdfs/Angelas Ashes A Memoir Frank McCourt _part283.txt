 of hell. It’s even worse 
 
 to be an informer. The master at school said that everytime the Irish 
 
 were about to demolish the English in a fair fight a filthy informer 
 
 betrayed them.A man who’s discovered to be an informer deserves to 
 
 be hanged or, even worse, to have no one talk to him for if no one talks 
 
 to you you’re better off hanging at the end of a rope. 
 
 In every lane there’s always someone not talking to someone or 
 
 everyone not talking to someone or someone not talking to everyone. 
 
 You can always tell when people are not talking by the way they pass each 
 
 other.The women hoist their noses, tighten their mouths and turn their 
 
 faces away. If the woman is wearing a shawl she takes a corner and flings 
 
 it over her shoulder as if to say,One word or look from you,you ma-faced 
 
 bitch, and I’ll tear the countenance from the front of your head. 
 
 It’s bad when Grandma won’t talk to us because we can’t run to her 
 
 when we need to borrow sugar
