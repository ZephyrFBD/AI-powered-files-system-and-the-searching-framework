Procedure 1 can be skipped; instead, ask your students to consider cell structure and 
function and have them calculate the surface area and volume of model cells. Procedure 
1 can be integrated into the water potential experiment (Procedure 3) by cutting potato 
pieces into different sizes and comparing the size/weight changes. 
Procedure 2 can by modified by having students choose among water, protein, and  
1 M sucrose. The model cells can be prepared and left overnight in the second solution 
and weighed the next day, as long as there is sufficient space in the dialysis tubing bags. 
An alternative is to place thin celery sticks in the solutions overnight and ask students to 
measure how far the celery can bend without breaking the next day. 
You can ask students to view videos that show the effect of salt or sugar solutions on 
plant cells. For example, see the following:
