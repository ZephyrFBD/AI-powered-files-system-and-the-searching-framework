cess. This chapter will review some of the
processes that cause populations to evolve and some of the equations that can be used to describe changes in
populations.
Population Genetics and Genetic Drift
Population genetics is the study of genetic variation within populations and the processes that can cause changes in
allele frequencies within a population. The three major processes that drive changes in allele frequencies in a
population are natural selection (which was discussed in Chapter 19), gene flow, and genetic drift.
Gene flow is the transfer of alleles from one population to another. Gene flow can be caused by the migration of
individuals into a population. If these individuals carry different alleles than the receiving population, the allele
frequency in the receiving population will change. In plants, gene flow can occur through the transfer of pollen (by
wind or animals) into new plant populations.
Genetic drift is the random loss of alleles in a population. Genetic drift
