ive fitness (the animal might die) but increases the fitness of the
colony or family. Scientists do not agree on how the trait of altruism
remains in a population if the individual carrying the gene or genes that is
responsible for the behavior dies.
One explanation can be seen in honeybees, where worker females share
75% of the same genes. When a worker honeybee stings an intruder while
defending a hive, the worker sacrifices itself for its relatives, individuals
who carry most of the same genes as that particular worker. The individual
dies, but relatives survive to pass on their genes, including the gene for
altruistic behavior. This concept is known as kin selection or inclusive
fitness.
