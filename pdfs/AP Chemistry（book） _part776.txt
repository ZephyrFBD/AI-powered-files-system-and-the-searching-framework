 It follows that if we measure the enthalpy of a reac-
tion and keep track of the bonds that are broken and formed, we can assign an enthalpy 
 
 
Sample Exercise 5.12 
Calculating an Enthalpy of Formation Using an Enthalpy of Reaction
The standard enthalpy change for the reaction CaCO33s4 ¡ CaO3s4 + CO23g4 is 178.1 kJ. Use Table 5.3 to calculate the 
standard enthalpy of formation of CaCO33s4.
SOLUTION
Analyze Our goal is to obtain ∆Hf°3CaCO34.
We can calculate ∆H° for this reaction by using Equation 5.31  
and data in Table 5.3. Remember to multiply the ∆Hf° value for 
each substance in the reaction by that substance’s stoichiometric 
coefficient. Recall also that ∆Hf° = 0 for any element in its most 
stable form under standard conditions, so ∆Hf°3O21g24 = 0.
 ∆H°
rxn = 36∆Hf°1CO22 + 3∆Hf°1H2O24 - 3∆Hf°1C6H62 + 15
2 ∆Hf°1O224  
 = 361-393.5 kJ2 + 31-285.8 kJ24 - 3149.0 kJ2 + 15
2 10 kJ24 
 = 1-2361 - 857.4 - 49.02 kJ 
 = -3267 kJ
(b)  
From the example worked in the text, ∆H° = -2220
