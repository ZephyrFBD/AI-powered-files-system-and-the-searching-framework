.‚Äù Another good
example of how cells communicate can be seen in neurons. An
impulse (electrical signal) passes along an axon to the terminal
branch of the neuron to the terminal branch at the synapse. At
the synapse, the electrical impulse is converted to a chemical
signal as neurotransmitter is released into the synapse. This
chemical signal triggers a response in another neuron, a gland,
or a muscle. This neuronal model is similar to the model
pictured in this question in that it depends on the interaction of
many different molecules. It also depends on the presence of
receptors. It differs, however, because there is an electrical
impulse in that cell communication model, whereas there is
none in the model pictured in the question.
Graph A shows that the expression of miR-215 is relatively low
in cancerous breast tissue (about 0.8) but is relatively high in
adjacent noncancerous breast tissue (about 2.3). In other words,
when the expression of miR-215 is present in high
concentration
