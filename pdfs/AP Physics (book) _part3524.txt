Momentum.
(c) Electric charge.
(d) Nucleon number.
(e) None of the above.
2. Fission fragments are typically
(a)
emitters.
(b)
emitters.
(c) Both.
(d) Neither.
3. Which of the following properties would decrease the crit-
ical mass needed to sustain a nuclear chain reaction?
(a) Low boiling point.
(b) High melting point.
(c) More neutrons released per fission.
(d) Low nuclear density.
(e) Filled valence shell.
(f) All of the above.
4. Rather than having a maximum at about 
as shown
in Fig.31â€“12, suppose the average binding energy per nucleon
continually increased with increasing mass number. Then,
(a) fission would still be possible, but not fusion.
(b) fusion would still be possible, but not fission.
(c) both fission and fusion would still be possible.
(d) neither fission nor fusion would be possible.
5. Why is a moderator needed in a normal uranium fission
reactor?
(a) To increase the rate of neutron capture by 
uranium-235.
(b) To increase the rate of neutron capture by 
uranium-238
