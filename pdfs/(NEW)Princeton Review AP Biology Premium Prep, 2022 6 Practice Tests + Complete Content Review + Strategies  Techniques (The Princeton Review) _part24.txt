Questions 12–16 refer to the following passage.
A gene responsible for production of hair pigment in dogs is called Fursilla (frsl). A map of
the Fursilla locus is shown in Figure 1, below. When expressed, it results in darkly pigmented dog
fur. When unexpressed, the hair is devoid of pigmentation and appears pure white. Expression of
Fursilla (frsl) depends on the binding/lack of binding of several proteins: Nefur (NEFR), Lesfur
(LSFR), and Dirkfur (DRKFR). Figure 2 shows the relative levels of frsl transcript as measured
via RT-qPCR when each protein is overexpressed or unexpressed in the cell.

12. Scientists identified a mutant allele of the Fursilla gene caused by a deletion of bases 1231–1295 on
chromosome 8. What is the likely
