eriodic
lifecycle events, such as flowering in plants or migration in birds.) Researchers have shown that 385 plant species in Great
Britain are flowering 4.5 days sooner than was recorded earlier during the previous 40 years. In addition, insect-pollinated
species were more likely to flower earlier than wind-pollinated species. The impact of changes in flowering date would be
mitigated if the insect pollinators emerged earlier. This mismatched timing of plants and pollinators could result in injurious
ecosystem effects because, for continued survival, insect-pollinated plants must flower when their pollinators are present.
Think About It
What are possible short-term and long-term effects of natural and human-induced processes on global climate change
and, consequently, ecosystems?
