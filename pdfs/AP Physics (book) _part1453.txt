n Table 13–3. Notice that even solids—for example, ice—have a
measurable saturated vapor pressure.
In everyday situations, evaporation from a liquid takes place into the air
above it rather than into a vacuum. This does not materially alter the discussion
above relating to Fig. 13–24. Equilibrium will still be reached when there are 
sufficient molecules in the gas phase that the number reentering the liquid equals
the number leaving. The concentration of particular molecules (such as water) in
the gas phase is not affected by the presence of air, although collisions with air
molecules may lengthen the time needed to reach equilibrium. Thus equilibrium
occurs at the same value of the saturated vapor pressure as if air were not there.
If the container is large or is not closed, all the liquid may evaporate before
saturation is reached. And if the container is not sealed—as, for example, a room
in your house—it is not likely that the air will become saturated with water vapor
(unless it
