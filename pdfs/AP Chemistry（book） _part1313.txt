e sum of several steps in the formation of an 
ionic compound.
COVALENT BONDING (SECTION 8.3) A covalent bond results from 
the sharing of valence electrons between atoms. We can represent the 
electron distribution in molecules by means of Lewis structures, which in-
dicate how many valence electrons are involved in forming bonds and 
how many remain as nonbonding electron pairs (or lone pairs). The oc-
tet rule helps determine how many bonds will be formed between 
two atoms. The sharing of one pair of electrons produces a single 
bond; the sharing of two or three pairs of electrons between two 
atoms produces double or triple bonds, respectively. Double and tri-
ple bonds are examples of multiple bonding between atoms. The 
bond length decreases as the number of bonds between the atoms 
increases.
BOND POLARITY AND ELECTRONEGATIVITY (SECTION 8.4) In 
covalent bonds, the electrons may not necessarily be shared equally 
between two atoms. Bond polarity helps describe unequal sharing o
