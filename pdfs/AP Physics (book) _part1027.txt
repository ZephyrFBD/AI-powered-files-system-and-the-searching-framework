ow calculate quantitatively how the pressure in a liquid of uniform
density varies with depth. Let us look at a depth h below the surface of the liquid
as shown in Fig. 10–3 (that is, the liquid’s top surface is a height h above this level).
The pressure due to the liquid at this depth h is due to the weight of the column
of liquid above it. Thus the force due to the weight of liquid acting on the area A
is
where Ah is the volume of the column of liquid,
is the density of the liquid (assumed to be constant), and g is the acceleration 
of gravity. The pressure P due to the weight of liquid is then
[liquid] (10;3a)
Note that the area A doesn’t affect the pressure at a given depth. The fluid pres-
sure is directly proportional to the density of the liquid and to the depth within the
liquid. In general, the pressure at equal depths within a uniform liquid is the same.
