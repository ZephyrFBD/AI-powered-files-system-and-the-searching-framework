directions of rotation (counterclockwise and clock-
wise), and assign the correct sign to each torque.
5. Apply Newton’s second law for rotation,
If the moment of inertia is not given, and it is not
the unknown sought, you need to determine it first.
Use consistent units, which in SI are:
in 
in 
and I in
6. Also apply Newton’s second law for translation,
and other laws or principles as needed.
7. Solve the resulting equation(s) for the unknown(s).
8. Do a rough estimate to determine if your answer is
reasonable.

1. As always, draw a clear and complete diagram.
2. Choose the object or objects that will be the system
to be studied.
3. Draw a free-body diagram for t
