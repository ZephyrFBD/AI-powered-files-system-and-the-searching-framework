the mating types are
present in two diﬀerent mycelia, it is termed heterothallic reproduction.
Segment B is made of DNA, while segment b is composed of
RNA.
(B)
They likely diﬀer in only one or a few nucleotides.
(C)
They likely have the exact same sequence.
(D)
There are a lot of variations in fungal sexual reproduction, but all of them
involve three stages. It begins with plasmogamy, during which two
haploid cells fuse, allowing two haploid nuclei to coexist in one cell.
During the next step, karyogamy, the haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid
zygote nucleus. Finally, gametes of diﬀerent mating types are generated.
These spores are then spread through the environment.
8. A common phenomenon that occurs during fungal sexual
reproduction, whether homothallic or heterothallic, is the pairing
of homologous chromosomes and the exchanging of diﬀerent
segments of their DNA. Which of the following best describes an
advantage of this process of “crossing over”?
It increases the number of chr
