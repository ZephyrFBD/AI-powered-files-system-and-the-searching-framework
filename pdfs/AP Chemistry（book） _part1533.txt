is nearly col-
orless. Which molecule would be a better one to use in a 
solar energy conversion device? (See the “Chemistry Put to 
Work” box for more information about solar cells.)
 
[9.110]  (a) Using only the valence atomic orbitals of a hydrogen 
atom and a fluorine atom, and following the model of 
Figure 9.46, how many MOs would you expect for the HF 
molecule? (b) How many of the MOs from part (a) would be 
occupied by electrons? (c) It turns out that the difference in 
energies between the valence atomic orbitals of H and F are 
sufficiently different that we can neglect the interaction of 
the 1s orbital of hydrogen with the 2s orbital of fluorine. 
The 1s orbital of hydrogen will mix only with one 2p or-
bital of fluorine. Draw pictures showing the proper orienta-
tion of all three 2p orbitals on F interacting with a 1s orbital 
on H. Which of the 2p orbitals can actually make a bond 
with a 1s orbital, assuming that the atoms lie on the z-axis?
