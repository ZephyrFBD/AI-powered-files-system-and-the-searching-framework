(D) All DNA molecules only contain N-14.
6. After two rounds of DNA replication, which of the following results would support the statement “DNA
replication is semiconservative”?
(A) All DNA molecules have one strand containing N-14 and one strand containing N-15.
(B) 50% of the DNA molecules only contain N-14, and 50% of the DNA molecules only contain N-15.
(C) All DNA molecules only contain N-15.
(D) 50% of the DNA molecules contain only N-14, and 50% of the DNA molecules have one strand
containing only N-15 and one strand containing only N-14.
7. Why does DNA replication proceed continuously on one strand of the double helix but discontinuously on the
other strand of the double helix?
(A) One stand of the double helix contains thymine, and the other strand contains uracil.
(B) Only G and C nucleotides appear on one strand of the double helix, and only A and T nucleotides appear
on the other strand of the doubl
