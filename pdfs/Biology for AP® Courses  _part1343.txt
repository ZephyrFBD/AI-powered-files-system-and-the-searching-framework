es carried on different chromosomes sort into gametes independently
of one another. This is Mendel’s law of independent assortment. This law can be demonstrated in a dihybrid cross involving
two different traits located on different chromosomes. Punnett squares can be used to predict genotypes and phenotypes of
offspring involving one or two genes.
Although chromosomes sort independently into gametes during meiosis, Mendel’s law of independent assortment refers to
genes, not chromosomes. In humans, single chromosomes may carry more than 1,000 genes. Genes located close together
on the same chromosome are said to be linked genes. When genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome,
their alleles tend to be inherited together unless recombination occurs. This results in offspring ratios that violate Mendel’s
law of independent assortment. Genes that are located far apart on the same chromosome are likely to assort independently.
