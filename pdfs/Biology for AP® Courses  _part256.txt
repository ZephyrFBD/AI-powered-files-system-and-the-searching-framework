Introduction
Food provides the body with the nutrients it needs to survive. Many of these critical nutrients are biological
macromolecules, or large molecules, necessary for and built by living things. For example, the amino acids found in protein
are needed to build healthy bone and muscle. The body uses fat molecules to build new cells, store energy, and for proper
digestion. Carbohydrates are the primary source of the bodyâ€™s energy. Nucleic a
