FIGURE 28–21 (a) Reading a CD 
(or DVD). The fine beam of a laser,
focused even more finely with lenses,
is directed at the undersurface of a
rotating compact disc. The beam is
reflected back from the areas between
pits but reflects much less from pits.
The reflected light is detected as
shown, reflected by a half-reflecting
mirror MS. The strong and weak
reflections correspond to the 0s and 
1s of the binary code representing the
audio or video signal. (b) A laser
follows the CD track which starts near
the center and spirals outward.
