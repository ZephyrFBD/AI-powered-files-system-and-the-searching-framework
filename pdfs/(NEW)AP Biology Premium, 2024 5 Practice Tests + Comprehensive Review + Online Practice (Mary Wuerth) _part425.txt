ize. Polymerase chain reaction is used to
amplify the number of copies of a specific DNA sequence, so choice (D) is incorrect.
6. (C) Polymerase chain reaction makes multiple copies of a specific DNA sequence and would be the best choice
for amplifying the number of copies of the HTT gene. Choice (A) is incorrect because CRISPR-Cas9 is used for
gene editing. Gel electrophoresis separates fragments of DNA by size, so choice (B) is incorrect. Restriction
enzymes cut DNA at specific sequences, so choice (D) is incorrect.
7. (B) Gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments by size and would be most useful for estimating the size of
the HTT gene isolated. DNA ligase attaches DNA fragments together, so choice (A) is incorrect. Polymerase
chain reaction amplifies specific sequences of DNA, so choice (C) is incorrect. Restriction enzymes cut DNA at
specific base pair sequences, so choice (D) is also incorrect.
8. (A) CRISPR-Cas9 is used for gene editing, and with the correct donor DNA, it could
