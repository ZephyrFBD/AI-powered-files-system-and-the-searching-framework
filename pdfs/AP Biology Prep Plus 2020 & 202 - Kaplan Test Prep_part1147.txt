cking this interaction would lead to less cAMP generation and
thus lower cAMP levels.
19. B
The existence of two phenotypes that are distinctly diï¬€erent (dominant
and recessive) would support the hypothesis that this is a Mendelian trait.
However, as shown on the graph, there are more than two phenotypes.
There is continuous variation in the population for which the researchers
have produced simplified group classifications for analysis. Thus, the
correct answer is (B). (A) is incorrect because the groups of male pattern
baldness are not distinct. (C) is incorrect because traits that are inherited
in a non-Mendelian manner can also have a strong genetic basis. (D) is
incorrect because four categories are used in the graph, and the level of
baldness varies continuously among the men.
20. A
(A) is the correct answer because the target organ, the kidney, fits the type
of action described: since ANP is produced in the heart, when it acts on
the kidney, it must do so in an endocrine fashion
