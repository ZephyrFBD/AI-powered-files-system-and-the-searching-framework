s the only variable on the 
left side of the equals sign.
SOLUTION (a) We are trying to solve for a, so we first subtract c from
both sides:
then divide by b:
and finally take square roots:
(b) If we are given that
and
then
But this is not the only answer. Whenever we take a square root, the number
can be either positive or negative. Thus
is also a solution. Why?
Because
just as 
So we actually get two solutions:
and
NOTE When an unknown appears squared in an equation, there are generally
two solutions for that unknown.
a = –3.
a = ±3
(±3)2 = 9.
(–3)2 = 9,
a = –3
a = B

= 3.
c = 6,
b = 2
a = B

a2b = 24 - c,
c = 6.
b = 2
a2b + c = 24

2x + 7 - 7 = 15 - 7
2x + 7 = 15.

Mathematical Review
To check a solution, we put it back into the original equation (this is really 
a check that we did all the manipulations correctly). In the equation
we put in
and find
which check
