roup of individuals. Similarly, the founder eﬀect occurs when a
small group of individuals breaks oﬀ from the larger population and
becomes isolated. In both cases, the allele frequencies in the small group
diﬀer from those of the original population. Over time, the changes in
allele frequencies become prominent in the small population (but would
have little eﬀect in a large population). Genetic driȇ may lead to the
formation of a new organism or species. However, since the new species
is a result of random changes and not natural selection, it may not be
well adapted to survive in its environment.
Unlike genetic driȇ, which takes place between two generations of one
population and in only one species, gene flow, also known as gene
migration, takes place between two populations of one species or
between two species. Gene flow is the process of moving genes between
populations via individuals entering or leaving the populations.
Movement, for example from migration and pollination, may
