This article, The transpiration of water at negative pressures in a synthetic tree, is a 
resource for teachers, and perhaps students, who want to learn more about real-world 
applications of transpiration, including using the principles behind transpiration for 
technological uses of water under tension.

TRANSPIRATION*
What factors, including environmental variables, 
affect the rate of transpiration in plants?
 
â– BACKGROUND
Cells and organisms must exchange matter with the environment to grow, reproduce, 
and maintain organization, and the availability of resources influences responses and 
activities. For example, water and macronutrients are used to synthesize new molecules, 
and, in plants, water is essential for photosynthesis. Organisms have evolved various 
mechanisms for accumulating sufficient quantities of water, ions, and other nutrients and 
for k
