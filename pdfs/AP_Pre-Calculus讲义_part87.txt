y read the frequency from these equations, we often write 
equations of simple harmonic motion in this form. 
 
Example 1 
The displacement of a mass suspended by a spring is modeled by the function 
y = 10 sin 4π t 
where y is measured in inches and t in seconds (see Figure 3).

(b) Sketch a graph of the displacement of the mass. 
 
 
 
 
 
An important situation in which simple harmonic motion occurs is in the production of 
sound.  
Sound is produced by a regular variation in air pressure from the normal pressure. If the 
pressure varies in simple harmonic motion, then a pure sound is produced.  
The tone of the sound depends on the frequency, and the loudness depends on the 
amplitude.

Example 2 
A sousaphone player plays the note E and sustains the sound for some time. For a pure E 
the variation in pressure from normal air pressure is given by 
V(t) = 0.2 sin 80 t 
where V is measur
