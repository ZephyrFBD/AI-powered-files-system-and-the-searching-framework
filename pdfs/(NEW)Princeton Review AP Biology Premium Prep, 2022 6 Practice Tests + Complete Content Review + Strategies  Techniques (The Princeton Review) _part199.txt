ithout trouble. When the diffusion requires the help of a channel-type protein, it is called
facilitated diffusion. Anytime that a substance is moving by diffusion, it is called passive transport because there
is no outside energy required to power the movement. It’s like riding a bicycle downhill. The molecules are just
“going with the flow.”
Passive transport does not require the input of metabolic energy. It is
important because it helps the cell import resources and export wastes.
Osmosis
When the molecule that is diffusing is water, the process is called osmosis. Water always wants to move from an
area where it is most concentrated to an area where it is least concentrated. Water is not usually pure water; since it
is so great at dissolving things, it usually exists as a solution. A solution is made when a liquid solvent dissolves
solute particles. So, if we rethink water moving down its concentration gradient, this is the same as saying that it
wants to go from where there is les
