s a beautiful deep red (Figure 12.47). Much later, in 1857, Michael Faraday reported 
that dispersions of small gold particles could be made stable and were deeply colored—
some of the original colloidal solutions that he made are still in the Royal Institution of 
Great Britain’s Faraday Museum in London (Figure 12.48).
Other physical and chemical properties of metallic nanoparticles are also different 
from the properties of the bulk materials. Gold particles less than 20 nm in diameter 
melt at a far lower temperature than bulk gold, for instance, and when the particles are 
between 2 and 3 nm in diameter, gold is no longer a “noble,” unreactive metal; in this 
size range it becomes chemically reactive.
At nanoscale dimensions, silver has properties analogous to those of gold in its 
beautiful colors, although it is more reactive than gold. Currently, research laboratories 
around the world are showing great interest in taking advantage of the unusual optical 
properties of metal na
