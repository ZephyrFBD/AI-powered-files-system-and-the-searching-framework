The electron transport chain produces a proton gradient that drives
ATP production. During aerobic respiration, oxygen is the final electron
acceptor in the ETC and is reduced to form water, marking the
completion of the ETC. Since bacterial ETCs are usually shorter than
mitochondrial ETCs, the proton gradient (used to drive ATP synthesis)
that is generated by bacterial ETC will be less than that generated by
mitochondrial ETC. Thus, bacterial ETC will produce less ATP per
oxygen molecule. The correct answer is (D). (A) is incorrect because
oxygen is not an electron donor but the final electron acceptor. (B) is
incorrect because alcoholic fermentation does not occur under
aerobic conditions. (C) is incorrect because protons, not electrons, are
pumped from one side of the membrane to the other to form a proton
gradient.
