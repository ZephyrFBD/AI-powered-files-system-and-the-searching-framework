CHAPTER 22
Electromagnetic Waves
1. The electric field in an EM wave traveling north oscillates in
an east–west plane. Describe the direction of the magnetic
field vector in this wave. Explain.
2. Is sound an EM wave? If not, what kind of wave is it?
3. Can EM waves travel through a perfect vacuum? Can sound
waves?
4. When you flip a light switch on, does the light go on imme-
diately? Explain.
5. Are the wavelengths of radio and television signals longer
or shorter than those detectable by the human eye?
6. When you connect two loudspeakers to the output of a stereo
amplifier, should you be sure the lead-in wires are equal in
length
