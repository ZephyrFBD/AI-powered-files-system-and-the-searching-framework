ed drastic population loss.
5. How would the results of this study have been different if factories produced white or light gray ash and soot
rather than black?
(A) There would be no change to the results of the experiment.
(B) There would have been added selection pressure for more white-bodied spotted moths and against black-
bodied spotted moths.
(C) There would have been added selection pressure for more black-bodied spotted moths and against white-

6. The Middle East blind mole rat (Nannosplalax ehrenbergi) lives in the Upper Galilee Mountains of Israel.
Two groups of these mole rats live in the same region, but scientists discovered that there is a 40% difference
in mitochondrial DNA between these two groups. These rats do not seem to interbreed in the wild. This is an
example of
(A) allopatric speciation
(B) sympatric speciation
(C) pre-zygotic barrie
