pening in two ways: The catalyst could provide a new mechanism for 
the reaction that has an Ea value lower than the Ea value for the uncatalyzed reaction,

or the catalyst could assist in the orientation of reactants and so increase A. The most 
dramatic catalytic effects come from lowering Ea. As a general rule, a catalyst lowers the 
overall activation energy for a chemical reaction.
A catalyst can lower the activation energy for a reaction by provi
