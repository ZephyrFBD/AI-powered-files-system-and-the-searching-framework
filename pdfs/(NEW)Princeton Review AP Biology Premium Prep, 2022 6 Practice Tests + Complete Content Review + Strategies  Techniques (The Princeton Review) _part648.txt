rase, not RNA polymerase, is the enzyme that causes the DNA strands to elongate. DNA
helicase unwinds the double helix, so (A) is true and therefore incorrect. Choice (B), which states that
DNA ligase seals the discontinuous Okazaki fragments, is also true. Eliminate it. In the presence of DNA
polymerase, DNA strands always grow in the 5สน to 3สน direction as complementary bases attach. Therefore,
(D) is also incorrect.

A
Ecosystems high in variation are more resilient than those with low biodiversity (so (B) is out). Meiosis
provides genetic variation but mitosis should provide almost none, so eliminate (C). Since crossing-over
is a source of genetic variation it can be a source of speciation (making (D) incorrect). Choice (A) is the
only correct answer.

C
Electrons passed down along the electron transport chain from one carrier to another lose energy and
provide energy for making ATP. Glucose is decomposed during glycolysis, but this process is not
associated with energy given
