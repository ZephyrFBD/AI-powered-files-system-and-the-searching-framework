 account for many properties of liquids, solids, and 
solutions, as you will see in Chapters 11, 12, and 13. Charge separation within mole-
cules plays an important role in energy conversion processes such as photosynthesis 
and in solar cells.
How can we quantify the polarity of a molecule? Whenever two electrical charges of 
equal magnitude but opposite sign are separated by a distance, a dipole is established. 
The quantitative measure of the magnitude of a dipole is called its dipole moment, 
denoted with the Greek letter mu, m. If two equal and opposite charges Q+ and Q- are 
separated by a distance r, as in Figure 8.10, the magnitude of the dipole moment is the 
product of Q and r:
 
m = Qr 
[8.10]
This expression tells us that the dipole moment increases as the magnitude of 
 
Q increases and as r increases. The larger the dipole moment, the more polar the bond. 
For a nonpolar molecule, such as F2, the dipole moment is zero because there is no charge 
separation.
