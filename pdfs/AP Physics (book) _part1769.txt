such as those done in Examples 16–9 and 16–10 for just this case (see Fig. 16–29).

Finally, in Fig. 16–32d, we see in cross section the field lines between two flat 
parallel plates carrying equal but opposite charges. Notice that the electric field
lines between the two plates start out perpendicular to the surface of the metal
plates (we will see why this is true in the next Section) and go directly from one
plate to the other, as we expect because a positive test charge placed between 
the plates would feel a strong repulsion from the positive plate and a strong
attraction to the negative plate. The field lines between two close plates are 
parallel and equally spaced in the central region, but fringe outward near the
edges. Thus, in the central region, the electr
