ecomes more disordered (entropy
increases). With each energy transfer, some energy from the system
is lost, primarily as heat. (ENE-1)
(B) Since adding more substrate did not increase production, you can
eliminate choice A. Choices C and D make no sense because
inhibitors affect enzymes, not substrates. (ENE-1)
(B) The most product is formed at pH 4.6. The pH increases and then
decreases. However, the reaction reaches its maximum at pH 4.6.
Alkaline means basic pH, and the whole experiment is carried out in
an acid environment. There is no information about temperature. (SP

(C) Raising the temperature would increase the number of collisions
and thus increase the rate of product formation. Introducing a
competitive inhibitor would slow the reaction down, decreasing the
amount of product, but it would not alter the state of collisions.
Raising the activation energy of the reaction would make it more
difficult to get the reaction to start and would not alter the number of
collisions. C
