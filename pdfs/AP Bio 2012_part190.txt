 per area 
of leaf on the rate of transpiration. The student recognizes 
and is able to articulate an understanding of the difference 
in rates of transpiration from 0–60 percent open stomata 
compared to 60 percent–100 percent open stomata. The 
student articulates understanding that as the number of 
open stomata increases, the rate of diffusion between the leaf 
interior and the environment will increase, and therefore the 
transpiration rate also increases. The student is then able to 
recognize that above 60 percent open stomata there must 
be another limiting factor, such as no difference in vapor 
pressure between the leaf interior and the environment. 
Transpiration is now limited by humidity.

that an adaptation is a trait that an organism possesses 
that increases its fitness within its niche. The student
