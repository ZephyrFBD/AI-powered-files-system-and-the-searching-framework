7. Two wheels having the same radius and mass rotate at the
same angular velocity (Fig. 8–38). One wheel is made with
spokes so nearly all the mass is at the rim. The other is a
solid disk. How do their rotational kinetic energies compare?
(a) They are nearly the same.
(b) The wheel with spokes has about twice the KE.
(c) The wheel with spokes has higher KE, but not twice as
high.
(d) The solid wheel has about twice the KE.
(e) The solid wheel has higher KE, but
