u(t) = eγt
Y = u(t) ∗Lα ∗Kβ    (t ∈(0, t0)) 
 
StageⅡ: Y grows with low-increasing speed 
{u(t) = u(t0) + (t −t0)ε
Y = u(t) ∗Lα ∗Kβ
  (t ∈(t0, t1)) 
 
StageⅢ: Y becomes stable 
Y = u(t1) ∗Lα ∗Kβ   (t ∈(t1, t2)) 
 
StageⅣ: Y declines due to the decreasing demand of the medication declines 
 
Y = D(t)   (t > t2) 
3.4.4 Solution and Result 
Set appropriate values of the parameters (γ and ε), we can draw the yield 
curve with the help of MATLAB. It is shown in Figure 5.

 Delivery Model 
In this model, our team comes up with two models to design the process of 
medication distribution. The two models both take vertical and lateral 
transportation into consideration and t, but one assumes that vertical and lateral 
transportation can take place at the same time while in the other model vertical 
transportation happens first and lateral transportation happens later in a
