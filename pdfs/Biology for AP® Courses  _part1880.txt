Genome mapping is similar to solving a big, complicated puzzle with pieces of information collected from laboratories all
over the world. Genetic maps provide an outline for the location of genes within a chromosome. Distances between genes
and genetic markers are estimated on the basis of recombination (crossing over) frequencies during meiosis. The Human
Genome Project helped researchers identify thousands of human genes and their protein products. Noncoding regions of
DNA may be involved in regulating gene expression, and other sequences once considered “junk” may play an important
role in genome evolution. Few differences exist between human DNA sequences and those of many other organisms.
