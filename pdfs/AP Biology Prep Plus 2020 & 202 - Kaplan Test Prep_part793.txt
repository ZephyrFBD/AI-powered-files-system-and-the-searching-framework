Because the songs appear diﬀerent in the “No Tutor” and
“Heterospecific Tutor” birds, spotted antbirds must learn to
produce the typical spotted antbird song.
(A)
Because the songs appear similar in the “No Tutor” and
“Heterospecific Tutor” birds, spotted antbirds must learn to
produce the typical spotted antbird song.
(B)
Because the songs appear diﬀerent in the “No Tutor” and
“Heterospecific Tutor” birds, song characteristics are innate
in spotted antbirds and do not require learning.
(C)
Because the songs appear similar in the “No Tutor” and
“Heterospecific Tutor” birds, song characteristics are innate
in spotted antbirds and do not require learning.
