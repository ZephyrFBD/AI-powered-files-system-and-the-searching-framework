s for a cross between plants that are heterozygous for
both traits?
What is the expected ratio of phenotypes from a dihybrid cross? How do you explain the difference between
the expected dihybrid cross ratio and ratio observed in the shepherd’s-purse plant?
Epistasis
Mendel’s studies in pea plants implied that the sum of an individual’s phenotype was controlled by genes (or as he called
them, unit factors), such that every characteristic was distinctly and completely controlled by a single gene. In fact, single
observable characteristics are almost always under the influence of multiple genes (each with two or more alleles) acting in
unison. For example, at least eight genes contribute to eye color in humans.
Eye color in humans is determined by multiple genes. Use the Eye Color Calculator (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
eye_color_calc) to predict the eye color of children from parental eye color.
A couple produces a green-eyed child. Both of the parents have brown eyes. Explain how thi
