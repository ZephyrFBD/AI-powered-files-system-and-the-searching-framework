lecular hydrogen in seawater. Also, the researchers 
discovered multiple species of bacteria living in the gills of the mussels. Mussels use gills for filter-feeding and gas 
exchange with the surrounding seawater. On the basis of their experimental results, the researchers hypothesized that 
some bacteria living in the gills of the mussels are capable of chemosynthesis. 
 
 
 6. Which of the following best explains how 
biological communities near deep-sea 
hydrothermal vents can exist in a habitat  
lacking sunlight? 
(A) Environmental conditions on some distant 
planets resemble those experienced by 
organisms living near hydrothermal vents. 
(B) Heterotrophs metabolize carbon-containing 
compounds produced by the photosynthetic 
organisms that live on the seafloor. 
(C) Some organisms rely on energy captured 
from inorganic compounds to drive basic 
biological processes. 
(D) Some organisms that can tolerate high 
temperatures are single celled, whereas 
others are multicellular.
