qualitative changes will occur in the 
temperatures of the system and in its surroundings? From the 
systemâ€™s perspective, is the process exothermic or endother-
mic? (b) If neither the volume nor the pressure of the system 
changes during the process, how is the change in internal en-
ergy related to the change in enthalpy? [Sections 5.2 and 5.3]

5.1 Two positively charged spheres, each with a charge of 2.0 *
10-5 C, a mass of 1.0 kg, and separated by a distance of 
1.0 cm, are held in place on a frictionless track. (a) What 
is the electrostatic potential energy of this system? (b) If 
the spheres are released, will they move toward or away 
from each other? (c) What speed will each sphere attain 
as the distance between the spheres approaches infinity?
