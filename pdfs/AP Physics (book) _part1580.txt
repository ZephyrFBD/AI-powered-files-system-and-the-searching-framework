18°C. A heater supplies energy at the rate of 
How long does it take for the water (a) to reach the boiling
point, and (b) to all have changed to steam?
31. (II) Determine the latent heat of fusion of mercury using
the following calorimeter data: 1.00 kg of solid Hg at its
melting point of 
is placed in a 0.620-kg aluminum
calorimeter with 0.400 kg of water at 12.80°C; the resulting
equilibrium temperature is 5.06°C.
32. (II) At a crime scene, the forensic investigator notes that the
6.2-g lead bullet that was stopped in a doorframe apparently
melted completely on impact. Assuming the bullet was shot
at room temperature (20°C), what does the investigator
calculate as the minimum muzzle velocity of the gun?
33. (II) A 64-kg ice-skater moving at 
glides to a stop.
Assuming the ice is at 0°C and that 50% of the heat generated
by friction is absorbed by the ice, how much ice melts?
34. (II) A cube of ice is taken from the freezer at

placed in an 85-g aluminum calorimeter filled with
