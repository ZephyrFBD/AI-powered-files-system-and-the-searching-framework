and closed. An open system is one in which energy can be transferred between the system and its surroundings. The stovetop
system is open because heat can be lost into the air. A closed system is one that cannot transfer energy to its surroundings.
Biological organisms are open systems. Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings, as they consume energy-
storing molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work. Like all things in the physical world, energy is
subject to the laws of physics. The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the
universe.
The First Law of Thermodynamics
The first law of thermodynamics deals with the total amount of energy in the universe. It states that this total amount
of energy is constant. In other words, there has always been, and always will be, exactly the same amount of energy
in the universe. Energy exists in many
