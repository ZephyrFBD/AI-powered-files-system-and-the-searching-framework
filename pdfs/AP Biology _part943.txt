 Resistance to a certain chemical arises because exposure to the
chemical kills all the insects except the ones that are already
resistant to it. The resistant population is selected for in this way and
reproduces a new population in which all the individuals are
resistant.
(C) Humans and chimps share an ancestor that walked upright about
6–7 million years ago.
(D) This is classic Darwinian evolutionary theory—the survival of
the best adapted.
(B) Choices A, C, and D all have the same problem. A new trait may
have appeared by a single mutation, by recombination of alleles, or
by genetic drift. However, that does not explain how the birds, on
average, came to have larger beaks.
(D) Look at individuals 1 and 2. Neither has the condition, but they
have a daughter who has the condition. Sex-linked dominant and
autosomal dominant can be eliminated because neither parent has
the condition. Sex-linked recessive can also be eliminated because
for the father to pass the trait to his daughter, h
