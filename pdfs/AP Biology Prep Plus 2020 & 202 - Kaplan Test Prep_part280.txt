12. The transport of water from roots to shoots is dependent on
diﬀerences in water potential, which are responsible for water
movement from cell to cell or over long distances in the plant.
Several factors, such as environmental pressure and solute
concentration, contribute to water potential. For example, the
process of transpiration, in which water evaporates from stomata,
creates a lower osmotic potential in the leaf, which causes water
to flow into it. However, to avoid dehydration, plants must
constantly monitor and adjust their rates of transpiration in
response to environmental conditions. Which of the following
best explains what would be observed if the light intensity
experienced by a plant were to be increased?
The rate of photosynthesis would increase, resulting in the
closing of stomata and thereby decreasing water loss.
(A)
The rate of photosyn
