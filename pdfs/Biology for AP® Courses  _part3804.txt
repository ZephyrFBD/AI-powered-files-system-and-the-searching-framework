 distal convoluted tubules.
d.
The loop of Henle empties into the distal convoluted tubule.
Renal Corpuscle
The renal corpuscle, located in the renal cortex, is made up of a network of capillaries known as the glomerulus and the
capsule, a cup-shaped chamber that surrounds it, called the glomerular or Bowman's capsule.
Renal Tubule
The renal tubule is a long and convoluted structure that emerges from the glomerulus and can be divided into three parts
based on function. The first part is called the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) due to its proximity to the glomerulus;
it stays in the renal cortex. The second part is called the loop of Henle, or nephritic loop, because it forms a loop (with
descending and ascending limbs) that goes through the renal medulla. The third part of the renal tubule is called the distal
convoluted tubule (DCT) and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex. The DCT, which is the last part of the nephron,
connects and empties its contents into collecting
