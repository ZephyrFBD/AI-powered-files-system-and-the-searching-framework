the plotted points.
Part II: Investigating Factors That Affect the Rate of Respiration
In this part of the investigation, you design an experiment to investigate a factor that may influence the rate of
respiration. For environmental factors, consider temperature, light intensity, and light wavelength. For biotic factors,
consider age or size of seed, or seeds of species that occupy different habitats. Also consider measuring respiratory
rates for small insects, comparing, for example, the respiratory rates of solitary insects and pairs of same sex and
opposite sex individuals.
Investigation 7: Mitosis and Meiosis
In this lab you explore the events that occur in cell division during mitosis and meiosis. You also investigate the
influence of environmental effects on mitosis and examine the effects of mutations and cancer on cell division. As
part of the review for this lab, you should read Chapter 7, “Cell Division.” In particular, review the activities that
occur during mitosis, meiosis
