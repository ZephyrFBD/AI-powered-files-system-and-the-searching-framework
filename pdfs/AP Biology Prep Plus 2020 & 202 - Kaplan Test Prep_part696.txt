ed the most recent common ancestor. However, the phyla Porifera,
Cnidaria, Echinodermata, Arthropoda, and Mollusca all share a single
common ancestor.

Molecular Biology
Siblings share more similar DNA with each other than they do with other
members of the same species. Similar species have more similar DNA
than do more distantly related species (in diﬀerent genera, for example).
Related genera share more similar DNA with one another than they do
with genera in another family.
RATES OF EVOLUTION
Prior to Darwin, and even for scientists today, there is an underlying
assumption that evolution takes a long time. The reasoning behind this
theory is that because mutation is the ultimate source of variation and
mutations that allow viable oﬀspring are extremely rare, the probability
of accumulating enough mutations to cause considerable change in
organismal form requires a lot of time. Due to this assumption, prior
