ver how he gave up his room 
 
 downstairs for the loft and he’s worn out climbing up and down to go to 
 
 the lavatory in the backyard. He calls down,Bring the table, the chair,I’m 
 
 coming down, and we have to clear off the table and pull it to the wall. 
 
 He’s fed up, he’s finished with the climbing, he’s going to use his mother’s 
 
 lovely chamber pot. He lies in bed all day reading books from the library, 
 
 smoking Gold Flake cigarettes and throwing Mam a few shillings to send 
 
 one of us to the shop so that he can have scones with his tea or a nice bit 
 
 of ham and sliced tomato.Then he calls to Mam, Angela, this chamber 
 
 pot is full,and she drags chair and table to climb for the chamber pot,empty 
 
  
  
 it in the lavatory outside, rinse it and climb back to the loft. Her face gets 
 
 tight and she says, Is there anything else your lordship would like this day? 
 
 and he laughs,Woman’s work,Angela,woman’s work and free rent.
