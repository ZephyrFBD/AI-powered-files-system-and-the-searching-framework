AP Biology Course and Exam Description
Course Framework V.1 | 18
UNITS
The course content is organized into commonly taught 
units. The units have been arranged in a common 
sequence frequently found in many college courses 
and textbooks. 
The eight units in AP Biology, and their weightings on the 
multiple-choice section of the AP Exam, are listed below. 
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and on the 
Course at Glance provide suggestions for how you can 
teach the required course content and administer the 
Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class periods 
are based on a schedule in which the class meets five 
days a week for 45 minutes each day. While these 
recommendations have been made to aid in planning, 
teachers should of course adjust the pacing based on 
the needs of their students, alternate schedules (e.g., 
block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
