possible explanation for the decline may be
due to a disappearing food source, so the food source should also show a decrease over time. The only animal
that also shows a decreasing population is deer.
29. D
There is no information about what species is a predator of skunks, and the population seems to be stable over
time, so this is impossible to determine. Even though the skunks and raccoons are both stable, there is no
indication that they are related to each other.
30. A
If the chipmunk is dependent on the acorns, then the acorns affect the carrying capacity. Since the quantity of
acorns would affect a large population differently than a small population, this makes it a density-dependent
factor.
31. D
None of the populations demonstrate exponential growth because they each have a carrying capacity that sets a
limit on their growth. Only populations growing as fast as they can reproduce at a maximal amount will grow
at an exponential rate.
