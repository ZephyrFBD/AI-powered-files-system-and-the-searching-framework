the
compressed air, assuming the pressure reaches 40 atm.
25. (II) If 16.00 mol of helium gas is at 10.0°C and a gauge 
pressure of 0.350 atm, calculate (a) the volume of the
helium gas under these conditions, and (b) the temperature
if the gas is compressed to precisely half the volume at a
gauge pressure of 1.00 atm.
26. (II) A storage tank contains 21.6 kg of nitrogen 
at an
absolute pressure of 3.45 atm. What will the pressure be if
the nitrogen is replaced by an equal mass of 
at the same
temperature?
27. (II) A storage tank at STP contains 28.5 kg of nitrogen 
(a) What is the volume of the tank? (b) What is the pres-
sure if an additional 32.2 kg of nitrogen is added without
changing the temperature?
28. (II) A scuba tank is filled with air to a gauge pressure of
204 atm when the air temperature is 29°C. A diver then jumps
into the ocean and, after a short time on the ocean surface,
checks the tank’s gauge pressure and finds that it is only
191 atm. Assuming the diver has inhaled
