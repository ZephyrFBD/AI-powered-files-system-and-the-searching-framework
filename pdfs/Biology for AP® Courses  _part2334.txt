warts (papillomavirus), and hepatitis A (hepatitis A virus).
Enveloped virions like HIV, the causative agent in AIDS, consist of nucleic acid (RNA in the case of HIV) and capsid
proteins surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer envelope and its associated proteins. Glycoproteins embedded in the viral
envelope are used to attach to host cells. Other envelope proteins are the matrix proteins that stabilize the envelope and
often play a role in the assembly of progeny virions. Chicken pox, influenza, and mumps are examples of diseases caused
by viruses with envelopes. Because of the fragility of the envelope, non-enveloped viruses are more resistant to changes in
temperature, pH, and some disinfectants than enveloped viruses.
Overall, the shape of the virion and the presence or absence of an envelope tell us little about what disease the virus may
cause or what species it might infect, but they are still useful
