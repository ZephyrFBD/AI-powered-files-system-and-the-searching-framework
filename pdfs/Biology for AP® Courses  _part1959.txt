otein. In an
approach called reverse genetics, investigations attempt to
determine the function of the gene, often by silencing the
gene using RNAi technology. Assume that you have the
ability to synthesize dsRNA from a DNA segment taken
from an organism whose whole genome has been
determined. Design a plan for collecting data that could
be used to assign a function to the protein encoded by this
sequence. (Hint: Donâ€™t worry about the number of
experiments that might need to be conducted to implement
your plan. An automated technique called high-throughput
screening robotically supports thousands of simultaneous
experiments.)
