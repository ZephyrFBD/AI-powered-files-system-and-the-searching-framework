organism benefits and the other is unaffected. Choice (D), endosymbiosis, is the idea that some
organelles originated as symbiotic prokaryotes that live inside larger cells.

A
Both bacteria and fungi contain genetic material (DNA), a plasma membrane, and a cell wall. Unlike
fungi, bacteria lack a definite nucleus. Therefore, eliminate (B). Bacteria are unicellular, whereas fungi
are both unicellular and multicellular. Therefore, eliminate (C) and (D).

B
This question tests your understanding of what stage of gene expression utilizes RNA polymerase. Since
the presence of RNA polymerase is required for transcription, the regulation is pre-transcriptional.
44.
C
Trypsin is an enzyme. Enzymes are proteins and organic catalysts that speed up reactions without altering
them. They are not consumed in the process. Therefore, you can eliminate (A) and (B). The rate of
reaction can be affected by the concentration of the substrate up to a point, so (D) can be eliminated.
