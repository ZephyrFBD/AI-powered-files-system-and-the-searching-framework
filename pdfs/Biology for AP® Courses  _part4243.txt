es (phylum Chordata) are an important predator in these fast-moving rivers and
streams.
As the river or stream flows away from the source, the width of the channel gradually widens and the current slows. This
slow-moving water, caused by the gradient decrease and the volume increase as tributaries unite, has more sedimentation.
Phytoplankton can also be suspended in slow-moving water. Therefore, the water will not be as clear as it is near the source.
The water is also warmer. Worms (phylum Annelida) and insects (phylum Arthropoda) can be found burrowing into the
mud. The higher order predator vertebrates (phylum Chordata) include waterfowl, frogs, and fishes. These predators must
find food in these slow moving, sometimes murky, waters and, unlike the trout in the waters at the source, these vertebrates
may not be able to use vision as their primary sense to find food. Instead, they are more likely to use taste or chemical cues
to find prey.
