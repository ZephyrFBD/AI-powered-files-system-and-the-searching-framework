60% of the
folding patterns found in viruses were common to all three
domains, as shown below. Fewer than 10% were unique to
viruses.

Viruses are acellular, and, consequently, they lie outside of
the three domains of cellular life. However, their exclusion
is increasingly challenged. Since 2012, several very large
viruses have been discovered, each a double-stranded
DNA virus with more than one million bases, with some
encoding nucleotides and amino acids. However, none
encode ribosomes, so these viruses are still dependent on a
marine bacteriovore (amoeba or flagellate) host for
replication.
Hypotheses regarding the origin of life on Earth need to
account for the relationship between proteins and genetic
information. Proteins are required to read and write
genetic information, but genetic information is required to
synthesize proteins. Which of these systems evolved first,
and if neither came first, how could they evolve
simultaneously? The RNA-first model is based on the
