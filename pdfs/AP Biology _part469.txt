A diverse gene pool is important for the survival of a species in a
changing environment.
In addition to natural selection, chance and random, nonselective
events (genetic drift, including bottleneck and founder effects)
can influence the evolutionary process, especially for small
populations.
Five conditions must be satisfied for a population to be in Hardy-
Weinberg (H-W) equilibrium: 1. large population; 2. absence of
migration; 3. no mutations; 4. random mating; and 5. absence of
natural selection. These conditions are seldom met. Be able to
calculate simple H-W problems.
Some phenotypes significantly increase or decrease the fitness of
an organism and of a population, such as sickle cell anemia,
peppered moth, DDT resistance, and antibiotic resistance in
bacteria.
Humans alter the environment and affect the survival of other
species, such as artificial selection, planting only one variety of a
particular crop, overuse of antibiotics, and habitat destruction.
