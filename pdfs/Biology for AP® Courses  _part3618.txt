The lung can compensate for these mismatches in ventilation and perfusion. If ventilation is greater than perfusion, the
arterioles dilate and the bronchioles constrict. This increases perfusion and reduces ventilation. Likewise, if ventilation is
less than perfusion, the arterioles constrict and the bronchioles dilate to correct the imbalance.

How does the downward movement of the diaphragm allow us to breathe?
a.
It reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity, increasing the air pressure in the lungs and triggering inhalation.
b.
It reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity, increasing the air pressure in the lungs and triggering exhalation.
c.
It creates a partial vacuum in the thoracic cavity into which outside air flows during exhalation.
