Billiard ball collision in 2-D. Billiard ball A moving with
speed  
in the 
direction (Fig. 7–19) strikes an equal-mass ball B
initially at rest. The two balls are observed to move off at 45° to the x axis,
ball A above the x axis and ball B below. That is,
and  
in
Fig. 7–19. What are the speeds of the two balls after the collision?
APPROACH There is no net external force on our system of two balls, assuming
the table is level (the normal force balances gravity). Thus momentum con-
servation applies, and we apply it to both the x and y components using the 
xy coordinate system shown in Fig. 7–19. We get two equations, and we have
two unknowns,
and 
From symmetry we might guess that the two balls
have the same speed. But let us not assume that now. Even though we are not
told whether the collision is elastic or inelastic, we can still use conservation of
momentum.
SOLUTION We apply conservation of momentum f
