edge about the structure and physiology of the kidneys, learning how we filter blood to eliminate
wastes—while also retaining vital water and other substances—provides an opportunity to apply concepts we’ve explored
previously. Lack of kidney function can have detrimental effects on our health.
In coordination with the circulatory and endocrine systems, the human excretory system serves several functions: excretion
of metabolic wastes, maintenance of water-salt balance (osmoregulation), maintenance of pH balance, and production of
hormones. The organs of the system are the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. Specialized cells of the kidney
called nephrons (not to be confused with neurons of the nervous system) are closely associated with capillaries. Urine
formation by nephrons involves three steps: filtration, in which water, nutrients, and wastes pass from the blood into the
nephron; reabsorption, in which nutrients such as glucose and most water are reabsorbed back into
