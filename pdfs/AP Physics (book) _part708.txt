 stronger than
any external forces. We can then ignore the effects of any other forces during the
brief time interval of the collision.
During a collision of two ordinary objects, both objects are deformed, often
considerably, because of the large forces involved (Fig. 7–8). When the collision
occurs, the force each exerts on the other usually jumps from zero at the moment
of contact to a very large force within a very short time, and then rapidly 
returns to zero again. A graph of the magnitude of the force that one object
exerts on the other during a collision, as a function of time, is something like 
the red curve in Fig. 7–9. The time interval 
is usually very distinct and very
small, typically milliseconds for a macroscopic collision.
