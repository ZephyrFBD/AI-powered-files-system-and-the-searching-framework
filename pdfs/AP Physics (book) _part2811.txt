very small (they are in the denominator of Eq. 25–6b). To make lenses of very
short focal length, compound lenses involving several elements must be used to
avoid serious aberrations, as discussed in the next Section.

Microscope. A compound microscope consists of a
eyepiece and a
objective 17.0 cm apart. Determine (a) the overall magnifi-
cation, (b) the focal length of each lens, and (c) the position of the object when the
final image is in focus with the eye relaxed. Assume a normal eye, so 
APPROACH The overall magnification is the product of the eyepiece magnifica-
tion and the objective magnification. The focal length of the eyepiece is found
from Eq. 25–2a or 25–5 for the magnification of a simple magnifier. For the
objective lens, it
