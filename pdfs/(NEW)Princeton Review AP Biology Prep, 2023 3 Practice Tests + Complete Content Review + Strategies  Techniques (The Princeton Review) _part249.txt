ctions that ultimately regenerate their starting product.
Both cycles have an indirect need for a particular substance; although they do not use it directly, without it they
cease to run. For the Krebs cycle, that substance is oxygen; for the Calvin cycle, that “substance” is light.
Furthermore, the goals of the two cycles are opposite; the Krebs cycle seeks to oxidize carbohydrates to CO2, while
the Calvin cycle seeks to reduce CO2 to carbohydrates.
Anaerobic Respiration
When oxygen is not available, the anaerobic version of respiration occurs. The electron transport chain stops
working, and electron carriers have nowhere to drop their electrons. The mitochondrial production of acetyl-CoA
and the Krebs cycle cease too.
Glycolysis, however, can continue to run. This means that glucose can be broken down to give net two ATP. Only
two instead of 30!
Glycolysis also gives two pyruvates and two NADH. The pyruvate and NADH make a deal with each other, and
pyruvate helps NADH get recycled ba
