 5.70 Write balanced equations that describe the formation of the 
following compounds from elements in their standard states, 
and then look up the standard enthalpy of formation for 
each substance in Appendix C: (a) H2O21g2, (b) CaCO31s2,

 5.71 The following is known as the thermite reaction:
 
 
2 Al1s2 + Fe2O31s2 ¡  Al2O31s2 + 2 Fe1s2
 
 This highly exothermic reaction is used for welding massive 
units, such as propellers for large ships. Using
