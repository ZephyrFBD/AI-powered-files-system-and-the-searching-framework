ly composed of molecules with fairly rigid, elon-
gated shapes, as well as polar groups to help align molecules through 
dipole–dipole interactions.
SOLUTION
(a) The compound is named carbon disulfide, in analogy with the 
naming of other binary molecular compounds such as carbon 
dioxide. 
 (Section 2.8)
(b) Because there is no H atom, there can be no hydrogen bond-
ing. If we draw the Lewis structure, we see that carbon forms 
double bonds with each sulfur:
S
C
S
Using the VSEPR model  
 (Section 9.2), we conclude that 
the molecule is linear and therefore has no dipole moment.  
 (Section 9.3) Thus, there are no dipole–dipole forces. 
Only dispersion forces operate between the CS2 molecules.
(c) The most likely products of the combustion will be CO2 and 
SO2.  
 (Section 3.2) Under some conditions, SO3 might be 
formed, but this would be the less likely outcome. Thus, we 
have the following equation for combustion:
CS21l2 + 3 O21g2 S CO21g2 + 2 SO21g2
(d) The critical temperature an
