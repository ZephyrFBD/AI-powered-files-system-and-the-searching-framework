The smaller E is, the more efficient our strategy is. Hence, what really matters is
the minimum of E . That is to say, what we should do is to find the extreme point of
function E and confirm the minimum of E so that we could find the most efficient
strategy to have a both sensible and enjoyable hot bath.

Put the data above into our models and we get the value of E is
1.929 and the model shows that it’s b
