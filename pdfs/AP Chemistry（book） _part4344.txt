ng substance in a chemical reaction; it appears 
to the left of the arrow in a chemical equation. (Section 3.1)
reaction mechanism A detailed picture, or model, of how the 
reaction occurs; that is, the order in which bonds are broken 
and formed and the changes in relative positions of the atoms as 
the reaction proceeds. (Section 14.6)
reaction order The power to which the concentration of a 
reactant is raised in a rate law. (Section 14.3)
reaction quotient (Q) The value that is obtained when 
concentrations of reactants and products are inserted into the 
equilibrium expression. If the  concentrations are equilibrium 
concentrations, Q = K; otherwise, Q ≠K. (Section 15.6)
reaction rate The speed at which a chemical reaction occurs; a 
measure of the decrease in concentration of a reactant or the 
increase in concentration of a product with time. (Chapter 14: 
Introduction and Section 14.2)
redox (oxidation–reduction) reaction A reaction in which certain 
atoms undergo changes in ox
