theoretical and experimental physics,
a feat almost unique in modern times.

APPROACH At first you might think that a special measuring device, a
micrometer (Fig. 1–11), is needed to measure the thickness of one page since
an ordinary ruler can not be read so finely. But we can use a trick or, to put it in
physics terms, make use of a symmetry: we can make the reasonable assump-
tion that all the pages of this book are equal in thickness.
SOLUTION We can use a ruler to measure hundreds of pages at once. If you
