s not correct because the atomic number, one, will never change
without changing the identity of the atom. Finally, (D) is not correct because radioactive atoms do not give off
electrons.

Active transport is the movement of substances across a membrane against their concentration gradient
through the use of energy (ATP). The sodium-potassium pump is a critical structure which uses ATP
hydrolysis to move sodium and potassium ions against their respective concentration gradients. Diffusion of
oxygen is an example of simple diffusion and can occur without the need of channels or pores. Water uses
aquaporins to travel across the membrane, down its concentration gradient; therefore, it also does not require
energy. Movement of sodium ions by a voltage-gated ion channel, (B), is an example of facilitated diffusion.
Because the sodium ions are still undergoing diffusion from high to low concentrations without the need of
ATP, this does not rep
