ch is hydrophobic. Choice
(B) states the polarity correctly. Because threonine is hydrophilic, it will be attracted to water in the
environment of the protein and thus toward the outside of the final protein. Hydrophobic side chains
like alanine are repelled by water, causing those side chains to be on the inside of the final protein. (C)
is incorrect because the polarity is not stated correctly. (D) is incorrect because the position of the
amino acid side chains in the final protein structure is incorrect.
13. (B) is correct. The formulae for surface area and volume are on the formula sheet that is given with
the exam. Volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the length of any side. Surface area of a cube is
calculated by squaring one side and multiplying that number by 6.
14. The correct answer is (A). The efficiency of diffusion is best for cells that have a higher surface area-
to-volume ratio. (B) is incorrect because while the surface area is larger, there is more volume for
