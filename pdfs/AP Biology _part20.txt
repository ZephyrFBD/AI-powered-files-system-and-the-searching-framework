Focuses on reasoning and analysis, evaluation, synthesis, and
application; not only on vocabulary.
Contains basic information in the body of the question so that
students do not have to recall details, but can demonstrate an
understanding of a concept. In this case, the concept being tested is
evolutionary adaptation, not reproduction.
Contains only four answers from which to choose.
Takes time to read, think about, and answer. Thatâ€™s why there are
only 60 multiple-choice questions on the AP Biology exam.
