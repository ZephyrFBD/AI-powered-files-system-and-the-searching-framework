ost first from the subshell having the largest value of n. Thus, in forming ions, 
transition metals lose the valence-shell s electrons first, then as many d electrons as required to 
reach the charge of the ion. For instance, in forming Fe2+  from Fe, which has the electron 
configuration 3Ar43d 64s 2, the two 4s electrons are lost, leading to an 3Ar43d 6 configu-
ration. Removal of an additional electron gives Fe3+, whose electron configuration is 
3Ar43d 5.

Which element forms a 3+ ion that has the electron configuration 3Kr44d 6?
8.3 ∣ Covalent Bonding
The vast majority of chemical substances do not have the characteristics of ionic 
materials. Most of the substances with which we come into daily contact—such as 
water—tend to be gases, liquids, or solids with low melting points. Many, such as 
gasoline, vaporize readily. Many are pliable in their solid forms—for example, plastic 
bags and wax.
For the very large class of substances that do not behave like ioni
