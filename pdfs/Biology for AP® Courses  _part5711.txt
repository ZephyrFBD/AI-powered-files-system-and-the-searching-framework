and on Barack Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and
Technology. He and his team found computer codes of digital data
embedded in the fabric of our reality. They relate to on-oﬀ electrical
charges of 1 and 0 in the binary system used by computers. ‘We have
no idea what they are doing there’, Gates said. They found within
the energetic fabric mathematical sequences known as error-
correcting codes or block codes that ‘reboot’ data to its original state
or ‘default seĴings’ when something knocks it out of sync. Gates was
asked if he had found a set of equations embedded in our reality
indistinguishable from those that drive search engines and browsers
and he said: ‘That is correct.’ Rich Terrile, director of the Centre for
Evolutionary Computation and Automated Design at NASA’s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, has said publicly that he believes the
Universe is a digital hologram that must have been created by a form
