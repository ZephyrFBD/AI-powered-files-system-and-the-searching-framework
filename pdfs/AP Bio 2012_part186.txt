nergy for building molecules.
• 
Plant becomes weakened and may die due to lack of ability to capture 
energy.
• 
Plant uses up pre-infection energy stores.
• 
Cannot perform growth/repair/reproduction due to lack of usable energy.
(Part c) 1 point for each reasonable predicted short-term change to the plant 
population or the prairie community, with justification. 
Predictions may include:
• 
Reduction in population size of affected prairie grass due to death of 
infected members. 
• 
Decrease in consumer population size as less energy available for the 
higher trophic levels.
• 
Smaller herbivore population size due to increased competition for limited 
resources.
• 
Unaffected plant species gain resources due to loss of infected plants. 
• 
Uninfected plants have increased offspring due to more available resources.

population or the prairie community, with justification.
