▲ Figure 5.9 Internal energy, E, a state function. Any state function depends only on the present  
state of the system and not on the path by which the system arrived at that state.

CHAPTER 5 Thermochemistry
An analogy may help you understand the difference between quanti-
ties that are state functions and those that are not. Suppose you drive from 
Chicago, which is 596 ft above sea level, to Denver, which is 5280 ft above 
sea level. No matter which route you take, the altitude change is 4684 ft. 
The distance you travel, however, depends on your route. Altitude is anal-
ogous to a state function because the change in altitude is independent of 
the path taken. Distance traveled is not a state function.
Some ther
