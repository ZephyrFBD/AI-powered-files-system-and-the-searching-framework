 H2O1g2
(a) Assume that you carry out this reaction with 25.0 g of cyclohexane and that cyclohexane is the limiting reactant. What is the 
theoretical yield of adipic acid? (b) If you obtain 33.5 g of adipic acid, what is the percent yield for the reaction?

 SOLUTION
Analyze We are given a chemical equation and the quantity of the 
limiting reactant (25.0 g of C6H12). We are asked to calculate the 
theoretical yield of a product H2C6H8O4 and the percent yield if 
only 33.5 g of product is obtained.
Solve
(a) The theoretical yield is:
