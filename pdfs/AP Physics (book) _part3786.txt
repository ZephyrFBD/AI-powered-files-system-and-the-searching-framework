most four hundred thousand years before the uni-
verse was cool enough for electrons to combine with nuclei to
form atoms (recombination). Photons, up to then continually
being scattered off of free electrons, could now move freely—
they were decoupled from matter and the universe became
transparent. The background radiation had expanded and
cooled so much that its total energy became less than the
energy in matter, and matter dominated increasingly over
radiation. Then stars and galaxies formed, producing a universe
not much different than it is today—some 14 billion years later.
Recent observations indicate that the universe is essentially
flat, that it contains an as-yet unknown type of dark matter,
and that it is dominated by a mysterious dark energy which
exerts a sort of negative gravity causing the expansion of the
universe to accelerate. The total contributions of baryonic
(normal) matter, dark matter, and dark energy sum up to the
critical density.
