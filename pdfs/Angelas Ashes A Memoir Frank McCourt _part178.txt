on the coffin after the 
 
 long swallow I push it away. 
 
 That’s Eugene’s coffin. I’ll tell Mam you put your glass on Eugene’s 
 
 coffin. 
 
 Now, son. Now, son. 
 
 Dad, that’s Eugene’s coffin. 
 
 The other man says,Will we have another pint, mister? 
 
  
  
 Dad says to me,Wait outside another few minutes, Francis. 
 
 No. 
 
 Don’t be a bad boy. 
 
 No.

 The other man says, By Jesus, if that was my son I’d kick his arse 
 
 from here to the County Kerry. He have no right to be talkin’ to his 
 
 father in that manner on a sorrowful day. If a man can’t have a pint the 
 
 day of a funeral what’s the use of livin’ at all, at all. 
 
 Dad says,All right.We’ll go. 
 
 They finish their pints and wipe the wet brown stains off the coffin 
 
 with their sleeves.The man climbs up to the driver’s seat of the carriage 
 
 and Dad and I ride inside. He has the coffin on his lap and he presses it 
 
 against his chest. At home our room is filled with big people, Mam,
