ecraft traveling at that speed as seen from Earth?

6. Spaceships A and B are traveling directly toward each
other at a speed 0.5c relative to the Earth, and each has
a headlight aimed toward the other ship. What value do
technicians on ship B get by measuring the speed of the
light emitted by ship Aâ€™s headlight?
(a) 0.5c.
(b) 0.75c.
(c) 1.0c.
(d) 1.5c.
7. Relativistic formulas for time dilation, length contraction,
and mass are valid
(a) only for speeds less than 0.10c.
(b) only for speeds greater than 0.10c.
(c) only for speeds very close to c.
(d) for all speeds.
8. Which of the following will two observers in inertial refer-
ence frames always agree on? (Choose all that apply.)
(a) The time an event occurred.
(b) The distance between two events.
(c) The time interval between the occurence of two events.
(d) The speed of light.
(e) The validity of the laws of physics.
(f) The simultaneity of two events.
