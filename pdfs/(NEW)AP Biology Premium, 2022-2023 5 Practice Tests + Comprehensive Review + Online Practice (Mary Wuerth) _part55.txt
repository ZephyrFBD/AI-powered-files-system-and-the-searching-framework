0 Petri dishes), or control
solutions (10 Petri dishes). Forty-eight hours after treatment, each Petri dish was examined, and the percentage
of cells that showed chromosome breakage in each Petri dish was calculated. The mean percentage of cells that
showed chromosome breakage and the standard error of the mean for each treatment were calculated and are
shown in the table.

(a) Describe which treatment produced the greatest variability in the data.
(b) Describe which treatment was least likely to result in chromosome breakage.
(c) A student claims that exposure to cadmium is more likely to result in chromosome breakage than exposure
to lead. Evaluate this claim using the data provided.
(d) Identify the independent variable and the dependent variable in this experiment.
