e phosphate
groups, in order of closest to furthest from the ribose sugar, are labeled alpha, beta, and gamma. Together, these chemical
groups constitute an energy powerhouse. However, not all bonds within this molecule exist in a particularly high-energy
state. Both bonds that link the phosphates are equally high-energy bonds ( phosphoanhydride bonds) that, when broken,
release sufficient energy to power a variety of cellular reactions and processes. These high-energy bonds are the bonds
between the second and third (or beta and gamma) phosphate groups and between the first and second phosphate groups.
The reason that these bonds are considered “high-energy” is because the products of such bond breaking—adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) and one inorganic phosphate group (Pi)—have considerably lower free energy than the reactants: ATP
and a water molecule. Because this reaction takes place with the use of a water molecule, it is considered a hydrolysis
reaction. In other words, ATP is hydrol
