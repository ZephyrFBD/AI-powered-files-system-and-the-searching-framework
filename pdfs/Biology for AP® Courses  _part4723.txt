pear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to
other ecosystems. The loss of an ecosystem means the loss of interactions between species, the loss of unique features of
coadaptation, and the loss of biological productivity that an ecosystem is able to create. An example of a largely extinct
ecosystem in North America is the prairie ecosystem. Prairies once spanned central North America from the boreal forest in
northern Canada down into Mexico. They are now all but gone, replaced by crop fields, pasture lands, and suburban sprawl.
Many of the species survive, but the hugely productive ecosystem that was responsible for creating the most productive
agricultural soils is now gone. As a consequence, soils are disappearing or must be maintained at greater expense.
