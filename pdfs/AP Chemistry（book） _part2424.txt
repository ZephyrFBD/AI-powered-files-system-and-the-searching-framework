SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 15.11
 Calculating Equilibrium Concentrations from Initial Concentrations
(2) We construct a table in which we tabulate 
the initial concentrations:
(3) We use the stoichiometry of the reaction 
to determine the changes in concentra-
tion that occur as the reaction proceeds to 
equilibrium. The H2 and I2 concentrations 
will decrease as equilibrium is established 
and that of HI will increase. Let’s repre-
sent the change in concentration of H2 by 
x. The balanced chemical equation tells us 
that for each x mol of H2 that reacts, x mol 
of I2 are consumed and 2x mol of HI are 
produced:
