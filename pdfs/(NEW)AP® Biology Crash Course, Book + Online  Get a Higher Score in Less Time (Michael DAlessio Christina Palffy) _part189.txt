y from glucose being used. (C) is
incorrect, as ATP synthase would be needed in the metabolism of amino acids and fatty acids as well.
All three types of monomers get converted into acetyl-CoA, after which the process is the same for
all. (D) is incorrect, since the diagram shows lipolysis is a process in the metabolism of fatty acids, so
absence of the enzymes that perform it would not affect glucose metabolism.
11. (C) is correct. While (A) and (B) are true statements, they do not serve to correct the misconception.
Both (A) and (B) can be correct with regard to the statement. (C) makes the statement impossible.
Organisms cannot pass on traits that they gain during their lifetime, so the stretched necks cannot be

12. The correct answer is (B). (A) is incorrect because while side chain of threonine has an OH– group
that makes it hydrophilic, alanine’s side chain only has a methyl group, whi
