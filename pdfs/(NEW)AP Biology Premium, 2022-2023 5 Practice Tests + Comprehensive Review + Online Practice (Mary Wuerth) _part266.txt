e S stage of the cell cycle, so a drug that blocks the replication of DNA would
have the greatest effect during the S stage. DNA does not replicate during G0, G1, or G2, so choices (A), (B),
and (C) are incorrect.
2. (A)  During G0, the cell is not dividing and has exited the cell cycle. G1, G2, and S are all stages that prepare
the cell to divide, so choices (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect.
3. (C)  At the beginning of anaphase, each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids. During anaphase, these
chromatids separate, and at the end of anaphase, each of these chromatids is considered a separate chromosome.
Thus, anaphase ends with twice as many chromosomes as it had at its beginning. During prophase,
chromosomes condense and become visible, but the number of chromosomes does not change. So choice (A) is
incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because in metaphase, chromosomes line up along the center of the cell but
the number of chromosomes does not change. In telophase, two new nuclei
