for fibrillin-1, a glycoprotein responsible for the production
and maintenance of elastic fibers found throughout the body. Without these
fibers, connective tissue is unable to provide flexibility and support to areas of the
body—structures like the heart, ligaments, and eyes are particularly aﬀected by
this disorder.
Figure 1. Inheritance of Marfan syndrome over three
generations of a family
The pedigree above traces the incidence of Marfan syndrome in one family over
the course of three generations. The results presented in the table indicate the
prevalence of MFS in several countries around the world.

14. Based on the information presented, in order for the MFS phenotype to
be present in the next generation, which of the following conclusions can
be made?
The mutations on the FBN1 gene are most likely passed on
