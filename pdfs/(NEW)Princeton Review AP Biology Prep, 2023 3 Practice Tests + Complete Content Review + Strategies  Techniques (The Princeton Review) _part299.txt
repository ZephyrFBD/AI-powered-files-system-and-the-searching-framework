ore independent events will occur simultaneously, one can
simply calculate the product of the probability that each will occur independently. This is called the Product Rule.
To determine the likelihood that EITHER event occurs, but not both, use another rule called the Sum Rule. To
illustrate the product rule, let’s consider again the cross between two identical dihybrid tall, green plants with the
genotype TtGg.
Product Rule: If A and B are independent, then:
P(A and B) = P(A) times P(B)
Sum Rule: If A and B are mutually exclusive, then:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
To find the probability of having a tall, yellow plant, simply multiply the probabilities of each event. If the
probability of being tall is  and the probability of being yellow is , then the probability of being tall and yellow is
.
Probability can be expressed as a fraction, percentage, or a decimal.
Remember that this rule works only if the results of one cross are not affected
by the results of another cross.
