gation provides a lab environment, guidance, and a problem 
designed to help students explore various parameters that can affect the rate of 
photosynthesis along with aspects of experimental design. Very little background 
knowledge is required to begin this work, but exploring some parameters deeply 
might require further research. For example, when students begin this procedure, they 
generally are not familiar with either the properties of light or the chemistry of dissolved 
carbon dioxide and bicarbonate ions. Students can begin asking and answering their 
own questions without this knowledge. As they work through the lab, students may be 
motivated to do additional research on photosynthesis. 
â–  Data Tables 
The analysis and presentation of data are difficult challenges for most students. Following 
is an example of a graph of results that a student might present:
