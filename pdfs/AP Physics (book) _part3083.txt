least two
observations that the Bohr model could not explain,
according to Section 27–13.
23. According to Section 27–11, what were the two main
difficulties of the Rutherford model of the atom?
24. Is it possible for the de Broglie wavelength of a “particle”
to be greater than the dimensions of the particle? To be
smaller? Is there any direct connection? Explain.
25. How can the spectrum of hydrogen contain so many lines
when hydrogen contains only one electron?
26. Explain how the closely spaced energy levels for hydrogen
near the top of Fig. 27–29 correspond to the closely spaced
spectral lines at the top of Fig. 27–24.
27. In a helium atom, which contains two electrons, do you
think that on average the electrons are closer to the
nucleus or farther away than in a hydrogen atom? Why?
28. The Lyman series is brighter than the Balmer series,
because this series of transitions ends up in the most
common state for hydrogen, the ground state. Why then
was the Balmer series discovered fir
