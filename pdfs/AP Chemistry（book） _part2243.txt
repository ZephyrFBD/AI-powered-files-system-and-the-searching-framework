 for a reaction by manipulating the Arrhenius 
equation. Taking the natural log of both sides of Equation 14.21, we obtain
ln k = ln Ae - Ea>RT
ln k = ln e - Ea>RT + ln A

which has the form of the equation for a straight line. A graph of ln k versus 1>T is a line 
with a slope equal to -Ea>R and a y-intercept equal to ln A. Thus, the activation energy 
can be determined by measuring k at a series of temperatures, graphing ln k versus 1>T, 
and calculating Ea from the slope of the resultant line.
We can also use Equation 14.22 to evaluate Ea in a nongraphical way if we know the 
rate constant of a reaction at two or more temperatures. For example, suppose that at two 
different temperatures T
1 and T
2 a reaction has rate constants k1 and k2. For each condi-
tion, we have
