According to the graph, 100% of the fruit flies eventually gathered
close to the cotton tip with banana (while far fewer gathered close to
the tip without it). This suggests that the banana smell serves as a
positive chemotactic stimulus. (D) is thus correct. (A) and (C) are
incorrect because the movement is clearly not random, irrespective of
whether a chi-square analysis is performed; all of the flies gathered
near the banana-coated tip, but only half near the non-coated tip. (B)
is incorrect because the results show the
