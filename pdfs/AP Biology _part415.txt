INTRODUCTION
volution is the change in allelic frequencies in a population.
Sometimes populations evolve rapidly, as in the case of the
development and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However,
evolution mostly takes place over hundreds, thousands, or millions of
years. The theory of evolution is supported by scientific evidence from
many disciplines.
