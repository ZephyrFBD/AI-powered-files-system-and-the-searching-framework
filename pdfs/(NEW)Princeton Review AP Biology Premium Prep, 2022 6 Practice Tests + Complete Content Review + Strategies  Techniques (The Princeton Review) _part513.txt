ach individual to have a unique set of fragments called
restriction fragment length polymorphisms, or RFLPs for short. This technology is used at crime scenes to help
match DNA samples to suspects.
LAB 10: ENERGY DYNAMICS
This lab examines energy storage and transfer in ecosystems. Almost all organisms receive energy from the Sun
either directly or indirectly:
Producers, or autotrophs, are organisms that can make their own food using energy captured from the Sun. They
convert this into chemical energy that is stored in high-energy molecules like glucose.
Consumers, or heterotrophs, must obtain their energy from organic molecules in their environment. They can
then take this energy to make the organic molecules they need to survive.
Biomass is a measure of the mass of living matter in an environment. It can be used to estimate the energy
present in an environment.
LAB 11: TRANSPIRATION
This lab investigates the mechanisms of transpiration, the movement of water from a plant to the atmos
