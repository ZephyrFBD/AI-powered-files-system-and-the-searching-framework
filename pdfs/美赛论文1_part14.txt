2.3 Dynamic Weighted Comprehensive Model 
We use the linear weighted method to process the indexes gained in Chapter 2.2 
and the weights gained in Chapter 2.1, which cannot shows the particularity of the 
indexes. For this, we consider using dynamic weighted methods to process the 
consistent index. We use different dynamic functions to show the difference of index 
due to its different levels. Usually we consider five levels and choose the dynamic 
function that best fits the index. We are more likely to use the following three 
dynamic functions.
