biological processes. For the following three properties of
water, define the property and give one example of how
the property affects living organisms:
1.
cohesion
2.
adhesion
3.
high heat of vaporization
a.
Cohesion is the attraction between the water
molecules, which helps create surface tension.
Insects can walk on water because of cohesion.
Adhesion is the attraction between water
molecules and other molecules. Water moving
up from the roots of plants to the leaves as a
result of capillary action is because of adhesion.
Heat of vaporization is the amount of energy
required to convert liquid into gas. This property
helps humans maintain homeostasis of body
temperature by evaporation.

other molecules, which help create surface
tension. Insects can walk on water because of
cohesion. Adhesion is the attraction between
water molecules. Water moving up from the
