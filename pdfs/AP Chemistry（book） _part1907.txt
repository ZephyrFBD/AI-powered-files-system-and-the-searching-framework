 three antibonding molecular orbitals. 
 (Section 9.8) The extended network of 
bonds leads to the formation of the same type of bands we saw for metals in Section 12.4. 
However, unlike metals, in semiconductors an energy gap develops between the filled 
and empty states, much like the energy gap between bonding and antibonding orbit-
als. 
 (Section 9.6) The band that forms from bonding molecular orbitals is called the 
3.35 Å
Each carbon atom is 
bonded to four other carbon 
atoms, forming a 
tedrahedron.

forces.

valence band, and the band that forms the antibonding orbitals is called the conduc-
tion band (Figure 12.30). In a semiconductor, the valence band is filled with electrons 
and the conduction band is empty. These two bands are separated by the energy band
