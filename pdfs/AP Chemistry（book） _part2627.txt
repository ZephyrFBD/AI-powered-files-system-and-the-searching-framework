BRØNSTED–LOWRY ACIDS AND BASES (SECTION 16.2) The 
Brønsted–Lowry concept of acids and bases is more general than 
the Arrhenius concept and emphasizes the transfer of a proton 1H+2 
from an acid to a base. The H+ ion is strongly bound to water. For 
this reason, the hydronium ion, H3O+1aq2, is often used to represent 
the predominant form of H+ in water instead of the simpler H+1aq2.
A Brønsted–Lowry acid is a substance that donates a proton to 
another substance; a Brønsted–Lowry base is a substance that accepts 
a proton from another substance. Water is an amphiprotic substance, 
one that can function as either a Brønsted–Lowry acid or base, de-
pending on the substance with which it reacts.
The conjugate base of a Brønsted–Lowry acid is the species that 
remains when a proton is removed from the acid. The conjugate acid 
of a Brønsted–Lowry base is the species formed by adding a proton 
to the base. Together, an acid and its conjugate base (or a base and 
its con
