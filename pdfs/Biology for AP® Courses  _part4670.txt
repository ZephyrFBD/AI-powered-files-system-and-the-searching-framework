ne nitrogen cycle, where the ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification processes
are performed by marine bacteria. Some of this nitrogen falls to the ocean floor as sediment, which can then be moved to
land in geologic time by uplift of the Earth’s surface and thereby incorporated into terrestrial rock. Although the movement
of nitrogen from rock directly into living systems has been traditionally seen as insignificant compared with nitrogen fixed
from the atmosphere, a recent study showed that this process may indeed be significant and should be included in any study
of the global nitrogen cycle.
