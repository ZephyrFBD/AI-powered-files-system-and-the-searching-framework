opulations and ecosystems.
ENE-1.O 
Explain how the activities of 
autotrophs and heterotrophs 
enable the flow of energy 
within an ecosystem.
ENE-1.N.1
Changes in energy availability can result in 
changes in population size.
ENE.1.N.2
Changes in energy availability can result in 
disruptions to an ecosystem—
a. A change in energy resources such as 
sunlight can affect the number and size of 
the trophic levels.
b. A change in the producer level can affect the 
number and size of other trophic levels.
ENE-1.O.1
Autotrophs capture energy from physical or 
chemical sources in the environment—
a. Photosynthetic organisms capture energy 
present in sunlight.
b. Chemosynthetic organisms capture energy 
from small inorganic molecules present in 
their environment, and this process can 
occur in the absence of oxygen.
ENE-1. O.2
Heterotrophs capture energy present in carbon 
compounds produced by other organisms.
a. Heterotrophs may metabolize 
carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins as 
source
