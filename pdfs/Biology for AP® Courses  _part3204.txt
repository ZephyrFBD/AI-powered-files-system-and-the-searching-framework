 to movement. Some hair receptors also detect skin deflection, and certain
rapidly adapting hair receptors allow detection of stimuli that have not yet touched the skin.
Integration of Signals from Mechanoreceptors
The configuration of the different types of receptors working in concert in human skin results in a very refined sense
of touch. The nociceptive receptors—those that detect pain—are located near the surface. Small, finely calibrated
mechanoreceptors—Merkel’s disks and Meissner’s corpuscles—are located in the upper layers and can precisely localize
even gentle touch. The large mechanoreceptors—Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings—are located in the lower layers
and respond to deeper touch. (Consider that the deep pressure that reaches those deeper receptors would not need to be
finely localized.) Both the upper and lower layers of the skin hold rapidly and slowly adapting receptors. Both primary
somatosensory cortex and secondary cortical areas are responsible for processi
