 use CO2 to make glucose in the Krebs cycle, and
heterotrophs produce CO2 as a waste product in the Calvin
cycle.
(B)
Autotrophs produce CO2 as a waste product in the Krebs
cycle, and heterotrophs use CO2 to make glucose in the
Calvin cycle.
(C)

3. Chlorophyll absorbs light energy and stores it as chemical energy
by catalyzing redox reactions. Which of the following figures most
accurately illustrates the structures required for photosynthesis?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
4. The graph above shows the rate of photosynthesis as a function of
light intensity. The rate of photosynthesis as a function of carbon
dioxide concentration exhibits similar behavior. Which of the
following best explains the relationship between carbon dioxide
concentration and the rate of photosynthesis?
At low concentrations, an increase in carbon dioxide has no
eï¬€ect on the rate of photosynthesis.
