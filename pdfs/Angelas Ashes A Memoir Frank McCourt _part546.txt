ey, food is very dear, growing boys eat a lot, ha ha,Alphie the 
 
 baby needs clothes and nappies. 
 
 I don’t know why she’s always angry. Her flat is warm and dry. She 
 
 has electric light in the house and her own lavatory in the backyard. 
 
 Uncle Pa has a steady job and he brings home his wages every Friday. 
 
 He drinks his pints at South’s pub but never comes home singing songs 
 
  
  
 of Ireland’s long woeful history. He says,A pox on all their houses, and 
 
 he says the funniest thing in the world is that we all have arses that have 
 
 to be wiped and no man escapes that.The minute a politician or a Pope 
 
 starts his blather Uncle Pa thinks of him wiping his arse. Hitler and 
 
 Roosevelt and Churchill all wipe their arses. De Valera, too. He says the 
 
 only people you can trust in that department are the Mahommedans for 
 
 they eat with one hand and wipe with the other.The human hand itself 
 
 is a sneaky bugger and you never know what it’s been up to.
