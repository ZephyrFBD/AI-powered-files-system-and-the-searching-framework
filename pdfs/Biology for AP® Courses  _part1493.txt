and cytosine were not found in equal quantities, and that it varied from
species to species, but not between individuals of the same species. He found that the amount of adenine equals the amount
of thymine, and the amount of cytosine equals the amount of guanine, or A = T and G = C. This is also known as Chargaff’s
rules. This finding proved immensely useful when Watson and Crick were getting ready to propose their DNA double helix
model.

The currently accepted model of the structure of DNA was proposed in 1953 by Watson and Crick, who made their model
after seeing a photograph of DNA that Franklin had taken using X-ray crystallography. The photo showed
