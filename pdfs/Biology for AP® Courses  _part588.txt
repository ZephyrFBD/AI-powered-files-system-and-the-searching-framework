mical gradients arise from the combined effects of concentration gradients and electrical
gradients. Structures labeled A represent proteins. (credit: “Synaptitude”/Wikimedia Commons)
If the pH outside the cell decreases, would you expect the amount of amino acids transported into the cell to increase
or decrease?
a.
Transport of amino acids into the cell increases
b.
Transport of amino acids into the cell stops.
c.
Transport of amino acids into the cell is not affected by pH.
d.
Transport of amino acid into the cell decreases.
Moving Against a Gradient
To move substances against a concentration or electrochemical gradient, the cell must use energy. This energy is harvested
from ATP generated through the cell’s metabolism. Active transport mechanisms, collectively called pumps, work against
electrochemical gradients. Small substances constantly pass through plasma membranes. Active transport maintains
concentrations of ions and other substances needed by living cells in the face of the
