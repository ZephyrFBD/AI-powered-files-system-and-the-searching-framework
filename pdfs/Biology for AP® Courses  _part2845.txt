us system to speed up or slow down. An added feature to cardiac muscle cells is a line than extends
along the end of the cell as it abuts the next cardiac cell in the row. This line is called an intercalated disc: it assists in
passing electrical impulse efficiently from one cell to the next and maintains the strong connection between neighboring
cardiac cells.
Nervous Tissues
Nervous tissues are made of cells specialized to receive and transmit electrical impulses from specific areas of the body
and to send them to specific locations in the body. The main cell of the nervous system is the neuron, illustrated in Figure

24.19. The large structure with a central nucleus is the cell body of the neuron. Projections from the cell body are either
dendrites specialized in receiving input or a single axon specialized in transmitting impulses. Some glial cells are also
shown. Astrocytes regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cel
