3' untranslated regions (UTRs). The presence
of RNA-binding proteins at the 5' or 3' UTR influences the stability of the RNA molecule.
RNA Stability and microRNAs
In addition to RBPs that bind to and control (increase or decrease) RNA stability, other elements called microRNAs can
bind to the RNA molecule. These microRNAs, or miRNAs, are short RNA molecules that are only 21â€“24 nucleotides in
length. The miRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer pre-miRNAs. These pre-miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs
by a protein called dicer. Like transcription factors and RBPs, mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to
the RNA; however, miRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex
(RISC). RISC binds along with the miRNA to degrade the target mRNA. Together, miRNAs and the RISC complex rapidly
destroy the RNA molecule.
