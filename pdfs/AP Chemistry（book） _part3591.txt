neral, there must be four OH -  per Si2O5
2 -. Thus, the for-
mula of chrysotile is Mg31Si2O521OH24. Since this is not reducible 
to a simpler formula, this is the empirical formula.

In the mineral beryl, six silicate tetrahedra are connected 
to form a ring as shown here. The negative charge of this 
polyanion is balanced by Be2 +  and Al3 +  cations. If elemental 
Beryl
analysis gives a Be:Si ratio of 1:2 and an Al:Si ratio of 1:3 what 
is the empirical formula of beryl: (a) Be2Al3Si6O19,  
(b) Be3Al2 1SiO426, (c) Be3Al2Si6O18, (d) BeAl2Si6O15?
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
The cyclosilicate ion consists of three silicate tetrahedra 
linked together in a ring. The ion contains three Si atoms and 
nine O atoms. What is the overall charge on the ion?

Quartz melts at approximately 1600 °C, forming a tacky liquid. In the course of melting, 
many silicon–oxygen bonds are broken. When the liquid cools rapidly, silicon–oxygen 
bonds are re-formed before the atoms are a
