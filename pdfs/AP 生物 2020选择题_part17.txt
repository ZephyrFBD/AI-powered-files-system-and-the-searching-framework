the walls of the 
xylem are polar. Water molecules are 
able to form hydrogen bonds with the 
xylem walls, and they are pulled up the 
xylem. 
(C) Water and the xylem are both nonpolar. 
Water molecules have the ability to form 
hydrogen bonds with one another but not 
with the xylem walls. 
(D) Water and the xylem are both polar. Water 
molecules have the ability to form 
hydrogen bonds with each other and with 
the walls of the xylem.

10. Protein X activates gene expression only in cells 
exposed to a specific signaling molecule. In a 
study, researchers determined the intracellular 
location of Protein X in cultured cells both 
before and after exposing the cells to the 
signaling molecule. The results of the study are 
shown in the diagram. 
Based on the results, which of the following best 
describes what Protein X is? 
(A) Protein X is an RNA splicing enzyme. 
(B) Protein X is a cell membrane receptor 
protein. 
(C) Protein
