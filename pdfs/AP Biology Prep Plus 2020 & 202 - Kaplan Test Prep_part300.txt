mooth muscles found in bronchial and
intestinal walls. Researchers have proposed the following
signaling cascade to explain these diﬀerential eﬀects.
Based on the researchers’ proposal, which statement best
explains the diﬀerential eﬀects of epinephrine on skeletal and
smooth muscles?
Epinephrine attaches to diﬀerent types of receptors in
skeletal and smooth muscles.
(A)
Diﬀerent second messengers transduce the signal in skeletal
and smooth muscles.
(B)
Glycogen metabolism is inhibited in smooth muscle and
enhanced in skeletal muscle by epinephrine.
(C)
The target of protein kinase A is diﬀerent in skeletal and
smooth muscles.
(D)
2. Infection by the bacterium Clostridium diﬀicile (C. diﬀ) results in
extensive tissue damage caused by the secretion of a toxin.
Microbiologists investigate secretion of the toxin by measuring its
accumulation in the nutrient broth in which the bacteria grow.
