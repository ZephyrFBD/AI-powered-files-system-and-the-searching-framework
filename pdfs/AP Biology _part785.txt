STUDY TIP
Programmed cell death plays an important role in normal development and differentiation.
During early embryonic development, webbing, a remnant of our
shared evolutionary history with other animals, connects the spaces
between fingers and toes. As development proceeds, cells that make up the
webbing undergo apoptosis. The webbing is eliminated, and the fingers
and toes can separate. Sometimes a human baby is born with some residual
webbing, the result of incomplete embryonic development.

Homeotic, Homeobox, or Hox Genes
Homeotic, homeobox, or Hox genes are master regulatory genes that
control the expression of genes that regulate the placement of specific
anatomical structures. They play a critical role in normal embryonic
development. A homeotic gene might give the instruction “place legs
here” in the developing embryo.
