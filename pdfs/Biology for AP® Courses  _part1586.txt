and use five types of polymerases, while
eukaryotes have multiple sites of origin and use
fourteen polymerases. Telomerase is absent in
eukaryotes. DNA pol I is the primer remover in
prokaryotes, while in eukaryotes it is RNase H.
DNA pol III performs strand elongation in
prokaryotes and pol δ and pol ε do the same
in eukaryotes.
c.
A prokaryotic organism’s rate of replication is
ten times faster than that of eukaryotes.
Prokaryotes have five origins of replication and
use a single type of polymerase, while
eukaryotes have a single site of origin and use
fourteen polymerases. Telomerase is absent in
prokaryotes. DNA pol I is the primer remover in
prokaryotes, while in eukaryotes it is RNase H.
