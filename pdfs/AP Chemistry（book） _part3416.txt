he 
speed of the neutron. The neutrons produced by fission have high speeds (typically in 
excess of 10,000 km/s). The function of the moderator is to slow down the neutrons (to 
speeds of a few kilometers per second) so that they can be captured more readily by the 
fissionable nuclei. The moderator is typically either water or graphite.
The primary coolant is a substance that transports the heat generated by the nuclear 
chain reaction away from the reactor core. In a pressurized water reactor, which is the most 
common commercial reactor design, water acts as both the moderator and the primary 
coolant.
The design of a nuclear power plant is basically the same as that of a power plant that 
burns fossil fuel (except that the burner is replaced by a reactor core). The nuclear power 
plant design shown in Figure 21.20, a pressurized water reactor, is currently the most pop-
ular. The primary coolant passes through the core in a closed system, which lessens the 
chance that radioactive
