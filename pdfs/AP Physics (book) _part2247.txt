Magnetic Permeability
If a piece of ferromagnetic material like iron is placed inside a solenoid to 
form an electromagnet (Section 20–7), the magnetic field increases greatly over
that produced by the current in the solenoid coils alone, often by hundreds
or thousands of times. This happens because the domains in the iron become
aligned by the external field produced by the current in the solenoid coil.

†The name “spin” comes from an early suggestion that this intrinsic magnetic field arises from the
electron “spinning” on its axis (as well as “orbiting” the nucleus) to produce the extra field. However,
this view of a spinning electron is oversimplified and not valid (see Chapter 28).
