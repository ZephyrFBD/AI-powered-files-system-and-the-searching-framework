quation showing how ∆HA is related to ∆HB and ∆HC. 
(b) Based on (ii), write an equation relating ∆HZ to the other 
enthalpy changes in the diagram. (c) The equations you ob-
tained in parts (a) and (b) are based on what law? (d) Would 
similar relationships hold for the work involved in each 
 
process? [Section 5.6]

5.9 In the accompanying cylinder diagram, a chemical process 
occurs at constant temperature and pressure. (a) Is the sign 
of w indicated by this change positive or negative? (b) If 
the process is endothermic, does the internal energy of the 
system within the cylinder increase or decrease during the 
change and is ∆E positive or negative? [Sections 5.2 and 5.3]

ample of a quantity that is a state function and one that is 
not. (c) Is the volume of a system a state function? Why or 
why not?
