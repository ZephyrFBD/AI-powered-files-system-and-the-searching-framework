 calculate ∆H ° for the combustion of propane gas at 298 K:
C3H81g2 + 5 O21g2 ¡ 3 CO21g2 + 4 H2O1l2 ∆H° = -2220 kJ
(a) Without using data from Appendix C, predict whether ∆G° for this reaction is more negative or less negative than ∆H°.  
(b) Use data from Appendix C to calculate ∆G° for the reaction at 298 K. Is your prediction from part (a) correct?
Sample Exercise 19.8 
Predicting and Calculating ∆G °
SOLUTION
Analyze In part (a) we must predict the value for ∆G° relative to 
that for ∆H° on the basis of the balanced equation for the reac-
tion. In part (b) we must calculate the value for ∆G° and compare 
this value with our qualitative prediction.
Plan The free-energy change incorporates both the change  
in enthalpy and the change in entropy for the reaction  
(Equation 19.11), so under standard conditions
∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S°
To determine whether ∆G° is more negative or less negative than 
∆H°, we need to determine the sign of the term T∆S°. Because T is 
the absolute temperature, 29
