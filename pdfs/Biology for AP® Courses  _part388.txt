O2 through water. These measurements were carried out at
four different temperatures. One type of membrane was
obtained from the cells in the eyeball of a calf (lens lipid).
Synthetic membranes composed of palmitic acid with
cholesterol (POPC/CHOL) and without cholesterol
(POPC) were also used. The results from these
experiments are shown in the table below.

B. Represent these data graphically. The axes should be
labeled, and different symbols should be used to plot data
for each material.
C. Analyze the data by comparing transport of oxygen
through the biological membrane, water, and the synthetic
membranes. Consider both membrane composition and
temperature in your analysis.
The plasma membrane separates the interior and the
exterior of the cell. A potential to do work is est
