y of most organisms,
scientists can look at fossil records and similar historic evidence. However, viruses do not fossilize, so researchers must
conjecture by investigating how today’s viruses evolve and by using biochemical and genetic information to create
speculative virus histories.
While most findings agree that viruses don’t have a single common ancestor, scholars have yet to find a single hypothesis
about virus origins that is fully accepted in the field. One such hypothesis, called devolution or the regressive hypothesis,
proposes to explain the origin of viruses by suggesting that viruses evolved from free-living cells. However, many
components of how this process might have occurred are a mystery. A second hypothesis (called escapist or the progressive
hypothesis) accounts for viruses having either an RNA or a DNA genome and suggests that viruses originated from RNA
and DNA molecules that escaped from a host cell. A third hypothesis posits a system of self-replication similar
