species; eliminate (B) and (D). If the scientist is hoping to investigate breeding, it is typical to choose a male
and a female for most animals; eliminate (C).
27. B
Choices (A) and (C) are incorrect: asexual reproduction involves the production of two new cells with the
same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. If the parent cell is diploid, then the daughter cells will be
diploid. Progeny cells are able to fuse together to form a zygote without an outside organism, so eliminate (D).
The daughter cells are identical to the parent cell, so choose (B).
28. B
Cohesion, adhesion, and capillary action are special properties of water that are necessary for transpiration to
occur. While high heat capacity is a special property of water, it does not have anything to do with
transpiration. Water is a hydrophilic, polar molecule.
29. B
The two species differ in their preference for water volume. Species A prefers 80 mL, and Species B prefers 40
mL. The different watering times do not s
