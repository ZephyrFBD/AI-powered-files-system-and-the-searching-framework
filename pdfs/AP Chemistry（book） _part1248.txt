CHAPTER 8 Basic Concepts of Chemical Bonding
Multiple Bonds
A shared electron pair constitutes a single covalent bond, generally referred to simply 
as a single bond. In many molecules, atoms attain complete octets by sharing more 
than one pair of electrons. When two electron pairs are shared by two atoms, two lines 
are drawn in the Lewis structure, representing a double bond. In carbon dioxide, for 
example, bonding occurs between carbon, with four valence electrons, and oxygen, 
with six:

As the diagram shows, each oxygen atom acquires an octet by sharing two elec-
tron pairs with carbon. In the case of CO2, carbon acquires an octet by sharing two 
electron pairs with each of the two oxygen atoms; each double bond involves four 
electrons.
A triple bond corresponds to the sharing of three pairs of electrons, such as in the 
N2 molecule:
