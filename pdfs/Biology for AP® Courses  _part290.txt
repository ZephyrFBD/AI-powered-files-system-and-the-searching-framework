Fats and Oils
Lipids include a diverse group of compounds that are largely nonpolar in nature. This is because they are hydrocarbons
that include mostly nonpolar carbon–carbon or carbon–hydrogen bonds. Non-polar molecules are hydrophobic (“water
fearing”), or insoluble in water. Lipids perform many different functions in a cell. Cells store energy for long-term use in the
form of fats. Lipids also provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals (Figure 3.13). For example, their
water-repellant hydrophobic nature can help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry by forming a protective layer over fur
or feathers. Lipids are also the building blocks of many hormones and an important constituent of all cellular membranes.
Lipids include fats, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids.
