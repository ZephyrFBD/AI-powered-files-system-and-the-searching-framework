Sound intensity on the street. At a busy street corner,
the sound level is 75 dB. What is the intensity of sound there?
APPROACH We have to solve Eq. 12–1 for intensity I, remembering that
SOLUTION From Eq. 12–1
Recalling that

&3 dB
Loudspeaker response. A high-quality loudspeaker is
advertised to reproduce, at full volume, frequencies from 30 Hz to 18,000 Hz with
uniform sound level 
That is, over this frequency range, the sound level
output does not vary by more than 3 dB for a given
