st’s authors are testing whether you can design and/or think critically about
experiments and the hypotheses, evidence, math, data, conclusions, and theories therein. There are six broad science
practices that are tested. The weight that each practice holds within the multiple-choice section is given.
Science Practice 1: Concept Explanation: Explain biological concepts, processes, and
models presented in written format. (25–33%)
Science Practice 2: Visual Representations: Analyze visual representations of
biological concepts and processes. (16–24%)
Science Practice 3: Questions and Methods: Determine scientific questions and
methods. (8–14%)
Scientific Practice 4: Representing and Describing Data: Represent and describe
data. (8–14%)
Scientific Practice 5: Statistical Tests and Data Analysis: Perform statistical tests and
mathematical calculations to analyze and interpret data. (8–14%)
Science Practice 6: Argumentation: Develop and justify scientific arguments using
evidence. (20–26%)
