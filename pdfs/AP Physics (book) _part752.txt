The center of mass of a system of total mass M moves in
the same path that a particle of mass M would move if subjected
to the same net external force. In equation form, this is Newton’s
second law for a system of particles (or extended objects):
(7;11)
where M is the total mass of the system,
is the acceleration
of the CM of the system, and 
is the total (net) external 
force acting on all parts of the system.]

RESPONSE After the rocket is fired, the path of the CM of the system contin-
ues to follow the parabolic trajectory of a projectile acted on by only a constant
gravitational force. The CM will thus land at a point 2d from the starting 
point. Since the masses of I and II are equal, the CM must be midway between
them at any time. Therefore, part II lands a distance 3d from the starting point.
