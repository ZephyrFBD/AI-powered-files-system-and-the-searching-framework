no vector is ever negative in the sense of its magnitude: the magnitude of every
vector is positive. Rather, a minus sign tells us about its direction.

A second way to add two vectors is the parallelogram method. It is fully equiva-
lent to the tail-to-tip method. In this method, the two vectors are drawn starting
from a common origin, and a parallelogram is constructed using these two vectors
as adjacent sides as shown in Fig. 3–6b. The resultant is the diagonal drawn from
the common origin. In Fig.3–6a, the tail-to-tip method is shown, and we can see that
both methods yield the same result.
FIGURE 3;7 The negative of a
vector is a vector having the same
length but opposite direction.
We can now define the subtraction of one vector from another: the difference
between two vectors 
is defined as
That is, the difference between two vectors is equal to the sum of the first plus
