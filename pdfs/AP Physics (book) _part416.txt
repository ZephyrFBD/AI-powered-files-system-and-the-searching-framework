backward in this situation. Is it really?
17. Mary exerts an upward force of 40 N to hold a bag of gro-
ceries. Describe the “reaction” force (Newton’s third law)
by stating (a) its magnitude, (b) its direction, (c) on what
object it is exerted, and (d) by what object it is exerted.
18. A father and his young daughter are ice skating. They face
each other at rest and push each other, moving in opposite
directions. Which one has the greater final speed? Explain.
19. A heavy crate rests on the bed of a flatbed truck. When the

too, accelerates. What force causes the crate to accelerate?
20. A block is given a brief push so that it slides up a ramp. After
the block reaches its highest point, it slides back down, but
the magnitude of its acceleration is less on the descent than
on the ascent. Why?
21. Why is the stopping distance of a truck much shorter than
