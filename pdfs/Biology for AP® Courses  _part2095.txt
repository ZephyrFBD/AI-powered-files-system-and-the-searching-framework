aten by birds with large and broad beaks.
Assuming that the drought continues and the population of
birds in the community stays isolated, what predictions for
the population can you make under the influence of natural
selection?
a.
The birds with small, thin beaks will grow
larger, broader beaks to be able to eat the larger
seeds. This will result in subsequent generations
having a higher percentage of birds with large,
broad beaks.
b.
There will be more birds with small, thin beaks
dying and more birds with large, broad beaks
surviving. Differential reproduction of birds with
large, broad beaks will result in subsequent
generations having a higher percentage of birds
with large, broad beaks.
c.
The species will diverge into two species, one
with small, thin beaks and one with large, broad
beaks. The two species will then compete for
resources.
d.
There will be neither phenotypic nor genotypic
changes in the population.
