A heat pump uses work W to bring heat 
from the cold
outside and deliver heat 
to warm the interior. The coeffi-
cient of performance of a heat pump is
(15;7)
because it is the heat 
delivered inside the building that counts.
The second law of thermodynamics can be stated in sev-
eral equivalent ways:
(a) heat flows spontaneously from a hot object to a cold
one, but not the reverse;
(b) there can be no 100% efficient heat engine—that is, one
that can change a given amount of heat completely
into work;
(c) natural processes tend to move toward a state of
greater disorder or greater entropy.
Statement (c) is the most general statement of the second law
of thermodynamics, and can be restated as: the total entropy, S,
of any system plus that of its environment increases as a re
