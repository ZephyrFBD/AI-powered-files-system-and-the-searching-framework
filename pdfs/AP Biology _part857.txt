PRACTICE QUESTIONS
Below is an illustration of a beaker that contains a cube of plant
tissue:
What is the water potential of the distilled water in the beaker, and
what is the water potential of the plant tissue? Use this equation to
help you solve this problem: Ψ = Ψs + Ψp
The water potential of the distilled water in the beaker is 0. The
water potential of the plant tissue is 0.
The water potential of the distilled water in the beaker is –0.3.
The water potential of the plant tissue is 0.
