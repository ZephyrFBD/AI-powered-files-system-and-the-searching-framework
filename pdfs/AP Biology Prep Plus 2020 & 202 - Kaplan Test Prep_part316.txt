for direct cell-to-cell communication, which allows
for incredibly fast, undisrupted signal transmission across large
areas. Plasmodesmata are plant cells’ equivalent of gap
junctions.

Test What You Learned
1. The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system
transmits signals through the release of the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptors associated
with the sympathetic system are G-protein-coupled receptors
usually found in the membrane of the target organ. The graph
shows the response of a target organ to acetylcholine with or
without atropine. The researchers observed that adding atropine
shiȇed the dose-response curve to the right. An increased dose of
acetylcholine was required to overcome the eﬀect of atropine on
the target organ.
Which mechanism of action of atropine would produce the eﬀects
recorded in the experiment?
Atropine and acetylcholine bind to the same site on the
receptor.
(A)
Atropine increases the eﬀectiveness of acetylchol
