ry systems of both invertebrate and vertebrate animals—from the
tracheal system of insects and gills of fish to lungs in reptiles, birds, and mammals—reflect a distinct pattern of evolution
as animals transitioned from aquatic to terrestrial environments. The function of all respiratory systems is to facilitate the
exchange of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) with the environment. Energy production in cellular respiration requires
O2, and CO2 is produced as a toxic by-product. Some animals, such as worms and amphibians, use their entire body surface
for respiration. Terrestrial animals, including humans, needed a more efficient system for gas exchange. So, take a deep
breath (pun intended!) as we take a dive into the activities and functions of the respiratory system.
Do not confuse the respiratory system with cellular respiration although both involve the movement of O2 and CO2 (gas
exchange) between organism and environment.
