 use an alloy such as ZrNi2 as the 
anode material. This eliminates the use and disposal problems asso-
ciated with Cd, a toxic heavy metal. 20.79 (a) When the battery is 
fully charged, the mole ratio of the elements in the cathode is: 0.5 
mol Li+ to 0.5 mol Co3 +  to 0.5 mol Co4 +  to 2 mol O2 -. The material 
is LiCo2O4 (b) 4.9 * 103 C of electricity delivered on full discharge 
of a fully charged battery 20.81 (a) The spontaneous reaction in 
the hydrogen fuel cell is hydrogen gas plus oxygen gas makes water.  
(b) E° = 1.23 V 20.83 (a) anode: Fe1s2 ¡  Fe2 +1aq2 + 2 e-; 
cathode: O21g2 + 4 H+1aq2 + 4 e- ¡ 2 H2O1l2 (b) 2 Fe2 +1aq2 +  
3 H2O1l2 + 3 H2O1l2 ¡ Fe2O3 # 3 H2O1s2 + 6 H+1aq2 + 2 e-;  
O21g2 + 4 H+1aq2 + 4 e- ¡ 2 H2O1l2 20.85 (a) Mg is called a “sac-
riﬁcial anode” because it has a more negative E°
red than the pipe metal 
and is preferentially oxidized when the two are coupled. It is sacri-
ﬁced to preserve the pipe. (b) E°
red for Mg2 +  is -2.37 V, more nega-
tive than m
