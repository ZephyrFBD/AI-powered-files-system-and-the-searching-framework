omic structure that is common to each group and how
that structure explains a common property of the group.

7. Imagine a line whose length equals the diameter of the
smallest orbit in the Bohr model. If we are told only that
an electron is located somewhere on this line, then the
electron’s position can be specified as 
where
the origin is at the line’s center and 
is the Bohr radius.
Such an electron can never be observed at rest, but instead
at a minimum will have a speed somewhere in the range
from
to
