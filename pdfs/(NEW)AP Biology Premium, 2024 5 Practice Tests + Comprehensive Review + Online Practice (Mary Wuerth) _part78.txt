en atom of one water molecule and the oxygen atom of another
water molecule. Choices (B) and (C) are incorrect because both describe intramolecular bonds, not
intermolecular bonds between different molecules. Choice (D) is incorrect because there is no transfer of
electrons between water molecules.
3. (C) Because of the attraction between water molecules that is the result of hydrogen bonds, more energy is
required to separate water molecules. Choice (A) is incorrect because although solid ice does have a lower
density than that of liquid water, this does not affect waterâ€™s specific heat. Choice (B) is incorrect because
specific heat does not depend on the energy needed to break the intramolecular covalent bonds within a water
molecule; rather, specific heat depends on the energy needed to break the intermolecular bonds between
molecules. Choice (D) is incorrect because oxygen atoms have a higher electronegativity than that of hydrogen
atoms.
4. (A) Of the choices presented, a stomach
