ension describes the attraction between molecules of water at the surface of a liquid.
Choice (C) is incorrect because capillary action describes water’s ability to climb up narrow tubes. Choice (D)
is incorrect since ice is not involved in sweating.
Short Free-Response
11. (a) Water forms hydrogen bonds between water molecules, so water requires more energy to evaporate than
molecules that do not form hydrogen bonds.
(b) Energy is required to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules before those molecules can
evaporate. As the hydrogen bonds are broken, heat energy is absorbed from the participant’s body, which
has a cooling effect.
(c) A nonpolar molecule would have a less effective cooling effect.
(d) Nonpolar molecules do not form hydrogen bonds between them, so they would require less energy to
evaporate and therefore have a less effective cooling effect.
12. (a) Arrow A indicates a hydrogen bond between water molecules.
(b) Oxygen has a much greater electronegativity than
