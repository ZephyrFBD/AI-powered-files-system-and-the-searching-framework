the volume of B is known). Starting from either a known volume or a known molarity of the  
solution containing B, we follow the green arrows to determine the mass of substance A.
masses of substances involved in a reaction into moles. When dealing with pure sub-
stances, as we did in Chapter 3, we use molar mass to convert between grams and moles 
of the substances. This conversion is not valid when working with a solution because 
both solute and solvent contribute to its mass. However, if we know the solute con-
centration, we can use molarity and volume to determine the number of moles (moles 
solute = M * V). Figure 4.17 summarizes this approach to using stoichiometry for the 
reaction between a pure substance and a solution.
