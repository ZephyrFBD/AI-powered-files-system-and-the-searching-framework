ies, while unlikely, would
only lead to more diversity in the adelgid population. There is no clear
reason for this to have a large impact on the native forest, so (D) is
incorrect.

Evaluate each answer choice. By recognizing individuals that they have
previously fought, animals can weigh the risks of fighting, thereby
reducing their risk of injury. Thus, (A) is a likely explanation.
Individuals that were regularly observed cooperating with other
individuals would no longer be considered asocial, so (B) is an unlikely
explanation and the correct answer. Â (C) and (D) are also likely
explanations, and therefore incorrect answers, because recognizing
individuals rather than fighting them repeatedly would save the
animals energy and time, so they can spend more time doing other
important activities, such as foraging.

By including other vocalizations as controls, the researchers showed
that lemurs specifically recognized alarm call
