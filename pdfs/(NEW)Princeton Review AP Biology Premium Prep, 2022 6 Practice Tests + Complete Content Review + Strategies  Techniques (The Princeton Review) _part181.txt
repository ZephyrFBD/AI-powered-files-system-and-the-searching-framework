 much higher rates than larger organisms
as a result of their efficient exchange of heat.
Therefore, even the largest things are still made of cells.
Surface Area-to-Volume Ratio
This is a concept that comes up often. Use the volume formulas on the
Equations and Formulas sheet to practice calculating the surface area-to-
volume ratios of different-sized cubes and spheres.
TYPES OF CELLS AND ORGANELLES
For centuries, scientists have known about cells. However, it wasnâ€™t until the development of the electron
microscope that scientists were able to figure out what cells do. We now know that there are two distinct types of
cells: prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells.
Cells are studied with different types of microscopes. Light microscopes (for example, the
compound microscopes commonly found in labs) are used to study stained or living cells.
They can magnify the size of an organism up to 1,000 times. Electron microscopes are used
to study detailed structures of a cell that cannot be eas
