ume they are constant. We use the ratio form of the ideal gas law.
SOLUTION Since
then
This is, incidentally, a statement of Gay-Lussac’s law. Since the pressure given is
the gauge pressure (Section 10–4), we must add atmospheric pressure 
to get the absolute pressure
We convert
temperatures to kelvins by adding 273 and solve for 
Subtracting atmospheric pressure, we find the resulting gauge pressure to be
243 kPa, which is a 16% increase
NOTE This Example shows why car manuals emphasize checking tire pressure
when the tires are cold.
