ong amino acid
would be added or maybe a Stop codon would be added. This can cause the protein to be the wrong shape when it folds
up. Protein shape is important for protein function, and if it is the wrong shape, it probably won’t work correctly.
b. Explain the impact of the radiolabeled dye on the cell cycle.
The radiolabeled dye does not impact the cell cycle. It is only being used to help track the phases of the cell cycle
and visualize them. We know the dye has no effect because it is used in the wild-type cells and it doesn’t cause them to
have an arrested cell cycle.
c. Predict what would happen if the cdc mutants were initially incubated at 37°C and then switched to 25°C.
If the mutants were started at 37°C, they would not grow. This is what happened in Experiment 1. If they were
switched to 25°C, then they would be able to start growing.
d. Justify your prediction.
I predicted that based on what occurred in Experiment 2. In that experiment they started at the lower
temperature
