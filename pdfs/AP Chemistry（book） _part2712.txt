centration of CO2 rises, the equilibrium concentrations in Equation 
17.10 shift to the left, which leads to the formation of more H+ and a 
drop in pH. This change is detected by receptors in the brain that trig-
ger a reﬂex to breathe faster and deeper, increasing the rate at which 
CO2 is expelled from the lungs and thereby shifting the equilibrium 
concentrations back to the right. When the blood pH becomes too 
high, the kidneys remove HCO3
- from the blood. This shifts the equi-
librium concentrations to the left, increasing the concentration of 
H+. As a result, the pH decreases.
Regulation of blood pH relates directly to the effective transport 
of O2 throughout the body. The protein hemoglobin, found in red 
blood cells (Figure 17.5), carries oxygen. Hemoglobin (Hb) reversibly 
binds both O2 and H+. These two substances compete for the Hb, 
which can be represented approximately by the equilibrium
HbH+1aq2 + O21aq2 ∆ HbO21aq2 + H+1aq2
