th a gas of unknown molar mass to a 
pressure of 735 torr at 31 °C, its mass is 137.456 g. When the flask is evacuated again and then filled with water at 31 °C, its 
mass is 1067.9 g. (The density of water at this temperature is 0.997 g>mL.) Assuming the ideal-gas equation applies, calculate 
the molar mass of the gas.

Volumes of Gases in Chemical Reactions
We are often concerned with knowing the identity and/or quantity of a gas involved in a 
chemical reaction. Thus, it is useful to be able to calculate the volumes of gases consumed 
or produced in reactions. Such calculations are based on the mole concept and balanced 
chemical equations.  
 (Section 3.6) The coefficients in a balanced chemical equation 
tell us the relative amounts (in moles) of reactants and products in a reaction. The ide-
al-gas equation relates the number of moles of a gas to P, V, a
