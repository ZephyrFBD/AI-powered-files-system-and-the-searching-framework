roxides are unstable, decomposing to O2 and oxides. In 
such reactions peroxides are simultaneously oxidized and reduced, a 
process called disproportionation. Superoxides contain the O2
- ion in 
which oxygen is in the -  1
2 oxidation state.
Sulfur is the most important of the other group 6A elements. It 
has several allotropic forms; the most stable one at room temperature 
consists of S8 rings. Sulfur forms two oxides, SO2 and SO3, and both 
are important atmospheric pollutants. Sulfur trioxide is the anhy-
dride of sulfuric acid, the most important sulfur compound and the 
most-produced industrial chemical. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid and 
a good dehydrating agent. Sulfur forms several oxyanions as well, 
including the SO3
2 -  (sulfite), SO4
2 -  (sulfate), and S2O3
2 -  (thiosul-
fate) ions. Sulfur is found combined with many metals as a sulfide, 
in which sulfur is in the -2 oxidation state. These compounds often 
react with acids to form hydrogen sulfide 1H2S2, which smells
