 absorbs light from 300 nm down to 650 nm. What is its band gap, in electron volts?
 ∆Hrxn = 1C ‚C enthalpy2 - 1C “ C enthalpy2 - 1C ¬C enthalpy2
 = 1839 kJ>mol2 - 1614 kJ>mol2 - 1348 kJ>mol2
     = -123 kJ>mol
(d) Let’s consider the case for n = 1. We note that the reactant side 
of the equation in part (b) has one C ‚C triple bond and two 
C ¬H single bonds. The product side of the equation in part (b) 
has one C “ C double bond, one C ¬C single bond (to link to 
the adjacent monomer), and two C ¬H single bonds. There-
fore, we are breaking one C ‚C triple bond and are forming one 
C “C double bond and one C ¬C single bond. Accordingly, 
the enthalpy change for polyacetylene formation is:
Because  ∆H is a negative number, the reaction releases heat 
and is exothermic.
(e) The sample of polyacetylene absorbs many wavelengths of 
light, but the one we care about is the longest one, which 
corresponds to the lowest energy.
