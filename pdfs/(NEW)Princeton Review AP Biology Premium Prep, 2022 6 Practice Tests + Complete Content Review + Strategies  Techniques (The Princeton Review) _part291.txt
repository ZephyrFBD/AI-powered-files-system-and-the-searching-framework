w Your Way Around a Square
A Punnett square is just a visual way to see all the possible offspring combos
that could result from two parents mating. The possible gametes for each
parent go on the sides and then they get matched up with each other to show
the possible offspring genotypes.
Remember, these squares are looking only at one (or sometimes two) genes.
So, they show possible offspring genotypes for that one gene only.
Monohybrid Cross
A monohybrid cross occurs when two individuals are crossed and one gene is being studied. A simple way to
represent a monohybrid cross is to set up a Punnett square. Punnett squares are used to predict the results of a
cross. Let’s construct a Punnett square for the cross between Mendel’s true-breeding tall and short pea plants. Let’s
first designate the alleles for each plant. As we saw earlier, we can use the letter T for the tall dominant allele and t
for the recessive short allele.
Since one parent was a pure, tall pea plant, we’ll give it two
