passage of small ions and molecules, including water and glucose, 
but not larger molecules such as starch and proteins. Like cell membranes, dialysis 
tubing is selectively permeable. Students fill their model cells with different solutions 
and determine diffusion rates. Students then can investigate questions about the 
movement of water across cell membranes and use their model cells to explore osmosis 
in more depth. 
Materials 
•  1 M sucrose 
• Dialysis tubing (5 pieces per group) 
•  1 M NaCl 
• Balances 
•  1 M glucose 
• 8 or 10 oz. drinking cups or beakers 
•  5% ovalbumin (egg white protein) 
(Note: 5% ovalbumin = 5 g/100 mL = 
50 g/liter. The MW of ovalbumin is 
45,000 g/mole. The molarity of a 5% 
solution = mole/45,000 g 3 50 g/liter = 
0.0011 M.) 
• Distilled water, volumetric pipettes,  
and graduated cylinders for preparing 
dilutions 
 
■ Preparation 
1. 1M sucrose: Dissolve 342.3 g of sucrose in 500 mL of H20; bring to 1 L total volume. 
2. 1 M NaCl: Dissolve 58.4 g
