rror is small compared to its radius of curvature. The reflected rays
diverge, but seem to come from point F behind the mirror, Fig. 23–19a. This is
the focal point, and its distance from the center of the mirror (point A) is the
focal length, f. The equation
is valid also for a convex mirror. We see
that an object at infinity produces a virtual image in a convex mirror. Indeed, no
matter where the object is placed on the reflecting side of a convex mirror, the
image will be virtual and upright, as indicated in Fig. 23–19b. To find the image
we draw rays 1 and 3 according to the rules used before on the concave mirror, as
shown in Fig. 23–19b. Note that although rays 1 and 3 don’t actually pass through
points F and C, the line along which each is drawn does (shown dashed).
The mirror equation, Eq. 23–2, holds for convex mirrors but the focal length f
and radius of curvature must be considered negative. The proof is left as a Problem.
It is also left as a Problem to show that Eq. 23–3 f
