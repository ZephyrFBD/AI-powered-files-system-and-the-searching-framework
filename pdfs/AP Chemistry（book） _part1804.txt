 Why do substances with high sur-
face tension also tend to have high viscosities?
 11.34  Based on their composition and structure, list CH2Cl2,
CH3CH2CH3, and CH3CH2OH in order of (a) increasing 
intermolecular forces, (b) increasing viscosity, (c) increas-
ing surface tension.
 11.35  Liquids can interact with ﬂat surfaces just as they can with 
capillary tubes; the cohesive forces within the liquid can be 
stronger or weaker than the adhesive forces between liquid 
and surface:

 (a) In which of these diagrams, i or ii, do the adhesive forces 
between surface and liquid exceed the cohesive forces 
within the liquid? (b) Which of these diagrams, i or ii, rep-
resents what happens when water is on a nonpolar surface?  
(c) Which of these diagrams, i or ii, represents what hap-
pens when water is on a polar surface?
 11.36  Hydrazine 1H2NNH22, hydrogen peroxide (HOOH), and 
water 1H2O2 all have exceptionally
