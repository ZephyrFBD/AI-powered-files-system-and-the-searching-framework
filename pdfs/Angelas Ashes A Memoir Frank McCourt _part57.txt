 Papa.That’s what Freddie calls his father and Dad is what I call my 
 
 father. 
 
 My mother’s whisper wakes me.What’s up with the child? It’s still early 
 
 and there isn’t much morning in the room but you can see Dad over 
 
  
  
 by the window with Margaret in his arms. He’s rocking her and sighing, 
 
 Och. 
 
 Mam says, Is she, is she sick? 
 
 Och, she’s very quiet and she’s a wee bit cold. 
 
 My mother is out of the bed, taking the child. Go for the doctor. 
 
 Go for God’s sake, and my father is pulling on his trousers over his shirt, 
 
 no jacket, shoes, no socks on this bitter day. 
 
 We wait in the room, the twins asleep at the bottom of the bed, 
 
 Malachy stirring beside me. Frankie, I want a drink of water.Mam rocks 
 
 in her bed with the baby in her arms. Oh, Margaret, Margaret,my own 
 
 little love. Open your lovely blue eyes,my little leanv. 
 
 I fill a cup of water for Malachy and me and my mother wails,Water 
 
 for you and your brother. Oh, indeed
