Entropy Changes in Chemical 
Reactions
In Section 5.5 we discussed how calorimetry can be used to measure ∆H for chemical reac-
tions. No comparable method exists for measuring ∆S for a reaction. However, because 
the third law establishes a zero point for entropy, we can use experimental measurements 
to determine the absolute value of the entropy, S. To see schematically how this is done, let’s 
review in greater detail the variation in the entropy of a substance with temperature.
Temperature Variation of Entropy
We know that the entropy of a pure, perfect crystalline solid at 0 K is zero and that the 
entropy increases as the temperature of the crystal is increased. Figure 19.12 shows that 
the entropy of the solid increases steadily with increasing temperature up to the melting 
point of the solid. When the solid melts, the atoms or molecules are fre
