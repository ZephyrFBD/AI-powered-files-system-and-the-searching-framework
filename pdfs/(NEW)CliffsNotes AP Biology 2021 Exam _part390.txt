subunits, and the polypeptide is released.
d. Once released, the amino acids in the polypeptide may interact with one another giving the polypeptide secondary
and tertiary protein structures. Secondary structure results from hydrogen bonding and produces two kinds of
structuresâ€”a helix or a pleated sheet. Tertiary structure results from additional bonding between R groups of the
amino acids and disulfide bonds between cysteine amino acids. In its final form, the polypeptide may be an enzyme
that can regulate a reaction that will produce some end product, or trait.
In the limited time you have available to answer this essay question, your goal should not be to discuss a single facet
of protein synthesis in extreme detail. Rather, you should try to discuss every step in the entire process, pursuing
detail only when you have available time. When your essay is evaluated, points are given for each step in the
process. There is a maximum number of points given for each step, so pursuing exce
