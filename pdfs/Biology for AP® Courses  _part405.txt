e electron microscopes crucial for the study of cell biology?
a.
Only electron microscopes can be used to view internal structures.
b.
Some electron microscopes allow visualization of three dimensional external shapes at very high
magnification in a way that is not possible with standard light microscopes.
c.
Scanning electron microscopes can show internal structures clearly at very high magnifications.
d.
Electron microscopes are easier to use and less expensive than light microscopes.
Cell Theory
The microscopes we use today are far more complex than those used in the 1600s by Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch
shopkeeper who had great skill in crafting lenses. Despite the limitations of his now-ancient lenses, van Leeuwenhoek
observed the movements of single-celled organisms, which he collectively termed “animalcules.”
In a 1665 publication called Micrographia, experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term “cell” for the box-like
structures he observed when viewing cork tissue th
