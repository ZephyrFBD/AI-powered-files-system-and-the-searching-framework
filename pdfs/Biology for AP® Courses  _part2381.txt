ine
deaminase (ADA), which breaks down purine bases. To treat this disease by gene therapy, bone marrow
cells are taken from a SCID patient and the ADA gene is inserted. This is where viruses come in, and
their use relies on their ability to penetrate living cells and bring genes in with them. Viruses such as
adenovirus, an upper respiratory human virus, are modified by the addition of the ADA gene, and the virus
then transports this gene into the cell. The modified cells, now capable of making ADA, are then given
back to the patients in the hope of curing them. Gene therapy using viruses as carrier of genes (viral
vectors), although still experimental, holds promise for the treatment of many genetic diseases. Still, many
technological problems need to be solved for this approach to be a viable method for treating genetic
disease.
Another medical use for viruses relies on their specificity and ability to kill the cells they infect. Oncolytic
viruses are engineered in the laboratory spe
