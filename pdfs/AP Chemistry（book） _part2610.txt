Many oxyacids contain additional oxygen atoms bonded to the central atom Y. 
These atoms pull electron density from the O ¬H bond, further increasing its polar-
ity. Increasing the number of oxygen atoms also helps stabilize the conjugate base by 
increasing its ability to “spread out” its negative charge. Thus, the strength of an acid 
increases as additional electronegative atoms bond to the central atom Y. For example, the 
strength of the chlorine oxyacids 1Y = Cl2 steadily increases as O atoms are
