4. Apply Kirchhoff’s loop rule for one or more loops:
follow each loop in one direction only. Pay careful
attention to subscripts, and to signs:
(a) For a resistor, apply Ohm’s law; the potential
difference is negative (a decrease) if your chosen
loop direction is the same as the chosen current
direction through that resistor. The potential
difference is positive (an increase) if your chosen
loop direction is opposite to the chosen current
direction.
(b) For a battery, the potential difference is positive if
your chosen loop direction is from the negative
terminal toward the positive terminal; the poten-
tial diff
