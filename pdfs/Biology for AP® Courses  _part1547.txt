construct an explanation of the multiple processes that increase
variation within a population.
DNA replication is a highly accurate process, but mistakes can occasionally occur, such as a DNA polymerase inserting a
wrong base. Uncorrected mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences, such as cancer. Repair mechanisms correct
the mistakes. In rare cases, mistakes are not corrected, leading to mutations; in other cases, repair enzymes are themselves
mutated or defective.
Most of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by DNA polymerase by proofreading the base that has
been just added (Figure 14.17). In proofreading, the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one, so
a correction can be made. The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the
template strand. If it is the right base, the next nucleotide is added. If an incorrect base has been added, the enzyme makes a
cut at the phosphodiester bond an
