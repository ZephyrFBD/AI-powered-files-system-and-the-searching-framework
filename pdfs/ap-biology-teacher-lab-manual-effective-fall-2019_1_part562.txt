■ Designing and Conducting Your Investigation 
Think about these questions again for a minute. 
•  What causes mutations in bacteria? Can mutations affect plasmids? How would you 
be able to tell if any observed changes in phenotypes are due to the expression of 
genes carried on plasmids and are not attributed to a possible mutagen? 
•  Do bacteria take up more in plasmid in some conditions and less in others? What 
conditions favor uptake, and which ones inhibit it? 
•  What other questions do you have about plasmids and transformation? 
You can either design an investigation focusing on the information below OR design 
one based on a question(s) or observation you had as you worked through the genetic 
transformation you just conducted. Be sure that your experiment applies the science 
skills you acquired as you worked through this investigation. Make sure that your 
teacher approves your plan. 
You should have noted satellites around the transformed colonie
