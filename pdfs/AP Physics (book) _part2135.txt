s with thick soles?
19. What is the main difference between an analog voltmeter
and an analog ammeter?
20. What would happen if you mistakenly used an ammeter
where you needed to use a voltmeter?
21. Explain why an ideal ammeter would have zero resistance
and an ideal voltmeter infinite resistance.
22. A voltmeter connected across a resistor always reads less
than the actual voltage (i.e., when the meter is not present).
Explain.
23. A small battery-operated flashlight requires a single 1.5-V
battery. The bulb is barely glowing. But when you take the
battery out and check it with a digital voltmeter, it regis-
ters 1.5 V. How would you explain this?
17. Design a circuit in which two different switches of the type
shown in Fig.19–39 can
be used to operate the
same lightbulb from
opposite sides of a
room.
