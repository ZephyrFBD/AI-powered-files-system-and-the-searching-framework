CHAPTER 24 The Chemistry of Life: Organic and Biological Chemistry
Petroleum, or crude oil, is a mixture of hydrocarbons plus smaller 
quantities of other organic compounds containing nitrogen, oxygen, 
or sulfur. The tremendous demand for petroleum to meet the world’s 
energy needs has led to the tapping of oil wells in such forbidding 
places as the North Sea and northern Alaska.
The usual first step in the refining, or processing, of petroleum is 
to separate it into fractions on the basis of boiling point (Table 24.5). 
Because gasoline is the most commercially important of these frac-
tions, various processes are used to maximize its yield.
Gasoline is a mixture of volatile alkanes and aromatic hydrocar-
bons. In a traditional automobile engine, a mixture of air and gaso-
line vapor is compressed by a piston and then ignited by a spark plug.
