ion 21–8), a new picture can be taken.
A CMOS sensor also uses a silicon semiconductor, and incorporates tran-
sistor electronics within each pixel, allowing parallel readout, somewhat like the
similar MOSFET array that was shown in Fig. 21–29.
Sensor sizes are typically in the ratio 4 3 or 3 2. A larger sensor is better
because it can hold more pixels, and or each pixel can be larger and hold more
charge (free electrons) to provide a wider range of brightness, better color accuracy,
and better sensitivity in low-light conditions.
In the most common array of pixels, referred to as a Bayer mosaic, color is
achieved by red, green, and blue filters over alternating pixels as shown in
Fig. 25–2, similar to what a color LCD or CRT screen does (Sections 17–11 and
24–11). The sensor type shown in Fig. 25–2 contains twice as many green pixels as
red or blue (because green seems to have a stronger influence on the human
eye’s sensation of sharpness). The computer-analyzed color at many pixels i
