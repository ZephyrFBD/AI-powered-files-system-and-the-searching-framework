guidance for an investigation. They help to focus 
the investigation on parameters that are most influential. Models have to be checked 
against real data. The assumptions and the limitations of any model should be explicitly 
articulated. Building models is a challenge, but it is a challenge that, when met, pays 
very large dividends in learning.
