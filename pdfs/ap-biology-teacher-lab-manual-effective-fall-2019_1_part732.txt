■ Timing and Length of Lab 
This investigation can be conducted during the study of many topics throughout the 
year. It would also be an excellent final lab activity to draw together many of the concepts 
and big ideas and science practices from the AP Biology Curriculum Framework. The 
investigation pulls together topics such as genetics, animal behavior, development, plant 
and animal structures from cells to organs, cell communication, fermentation, and 
evolution. 
This lab requires two to four 50-minute class periods. The basic part of the lab can be 
completed in two class periods. This would include the initial experiment with geotaxis 
and the basic constr
