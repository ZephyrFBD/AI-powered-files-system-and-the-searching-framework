 be recycled through
ecosystems. Many fungi and bacteria are decomposers. Detritivores are organisms that obtain energy by consuming
the organic waste of dead plants and animals. Millipedes, centipedes, and earthworms are examples of detritivores.
Both decomposers and detritivores are important in nutrient cycling in ecosystems.
Some organisms show unusual strategies for obtaining energy. A small number of organisms exhibit
kleptoplasty. Kleptoplasty is when a heterotroph consumes an autotroph that it uses as a food source but removes
the chloroplasts from the autotrophâ€™s cells and incorporates them into its own cells. The sea slug Elysia crispata
consumes algae for food and incorporates the chloroplasts (from the algae it consumes) into its own cells. When the
sea slug cannot find food to eat, it moves into the sunlight, and the chloroplasts it incorporated into its cells perform
photosynthesis, providing food for the sea slug.
As energy moves between trophic levels, energy is lost. T
