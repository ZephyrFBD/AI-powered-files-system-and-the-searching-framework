ant may be recessive or
dominant to the wild-type allele.
An example of multiple alleles is coat color in rabbits (Figure 12.8). Here, four alleles exist for the c gene. The wild-type
version, C+C+, is expressed as brown fur. The chinchilla phenotype, cchcch, is expressed as black-tipped white fur. The
Himalayan phenotype, chch, has black fur on the extremities and white fur elsewhere. Finally, the albino, or “colorless”
phenotype, cc, is expressed as white fur. In cases of multiple alleles, dominance hierarchies can exist. In this case, the wild-
type allele is dominant over all the others, chinchilla is incompletely dominant over Himalayan and albino, and Himalayan
is dominant over albino. This hierarchy, or allelic series, was revealed by observing the phenotypes of each possible
heterozygote offspring.
