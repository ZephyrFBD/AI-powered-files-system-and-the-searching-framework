vely helpless and immature at birth. By the time they reach adulthood, they must
develop skills to compete for natural resources. In plants, scientists think of parental care more broadly: how long fruit takes
to develop or how long it remains on the plant are determining factors in the time to the next reproductive event. Examples
of K-selected species are primates (including humans), elephants, and plants such as oak trees (Figure 36.14a).
Oak trees grow very slowly and take, on average, 20 years to produce their first seeds, known as acorns. As many as 50,000
acorns can be produced by an individual tree, but the germination rate is low as many of these rot or are eaten by animals
such as squirrels. In some years, oaks may produce an exceptionally large number of acorns, and these years may be on a
two- or three-year cycle depending on the species of oak (r-selection).
As oak trees grow to a large size and for many years before they begin to produce acorns, they devote a large percen
