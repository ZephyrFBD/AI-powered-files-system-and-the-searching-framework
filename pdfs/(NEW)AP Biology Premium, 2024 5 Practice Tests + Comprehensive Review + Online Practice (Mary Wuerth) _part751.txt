ecause DNA sequencing is the process
of reading the sequence of nucleotide bases in DNA.
54. (A) Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic information between organisms in the same generation;
conjugation, transformation, and transduction are all forms of horizontal gene transfer. Choice (B) is incorrect
because having the incorrect number of chromosomes is an aneuploidy. Horizontal gene transfer can occur in
both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, so choice (C) is incorrect. Horizontal gene transfer does not reduce
genetic diversity, so choice (D) is incorrect.
55. (D) If the birth rate exceeds the death rate in a population, the population size will increase. Choice (A) is
incorrect because a populationâ€™s size could increase if the birth rate was less than 1.0 and if the death rate was
less than the birth rate. If the death rate is greater than 0 but the birth rate is greater than the death rate, the
population size will increase, so choice (B) is incorrect. There is no evid
