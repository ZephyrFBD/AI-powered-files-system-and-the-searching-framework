d other particles as well. The uncertainty principle allows
a particle to jump briefly up to a normal energy, thus creating a particle;antiparticle
pair. It is possible that they could be the source of the recently discovered dark
energy that fills the universe (Chapter 33). We still have a lot to learn.
32â€“4 Particle Interactions and
Conservation Laws
One of the important uses of high-energy accelerators and colliders is to study
the interactions of elementary particles with each other. As a means of ordering
this subnuclear world, the conservation laws are indispensable. The laws of
conservation of energy, of momentum, of angular momentum, and of electric
charge are found to hold precisely in all particle interactions.
A study of particle interactions has revealed a number of new conservation
laws which (just like the old ones) are ordering principles: they help to explain
why some reactions occur and others do not. For example, the following reaction
has never been observed:
even th
