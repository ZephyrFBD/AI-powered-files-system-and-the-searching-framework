m XY. A 
solution that is initially 1.00 mM in each protein is allowed 
to reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, 0.20 mM of free X and 
0.20 mM of free Y remain. What is Kc for the reaction?
 15.40 A chemist at a pharmaceutical company is measuring equi-
librium constants for reactions in which drug candidate 
molecules bind to a protein involved in cancer. The drug 
molecules bind the protein in a 1:1 ratio to form a drug–pro-
tein complex. The protein concentration in aqueous solution 
at 25 °C is 1.50 * 10-6 M. Drug A is introduced into the pro-
tein solution at an initial concentration of 2.00 * 10-6 M. 
Drug B is introduced into a separate, identical protein solu-
tion at an initial concentration of 2.00 * 10-6 M. At equilib-
rium, the drug A–protein solution has an A–protein complex 
concentration of 1.00 * 10-6 M, and the drug B solution 
has a B–protein complex concentration of 1.40 * 10-6 M. 
Calculate the Kc value for the A–protein binding reaction 
and for the B–protein binding
