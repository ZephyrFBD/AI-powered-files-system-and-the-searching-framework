LAB 1: ARTIFICIAL SELECTION
This lab explores artificial selectionâ€”the process by which humans decide traits to enhance or diminish in other
species by crossing individuals with the desired phenotype. You need to understand the basic principles of natural
selection and how natural selection drives evolution, listed below:
Variation is present in any population.
Natural selection, or differential reproduction in a population, is a major mechanism in evolution.
Natural selection acts on phenotypic variations in populations. Some organisms will have traits that are more
favorable to the environment and will survive to reproduce more than other individuals, causing the genetic
makeup of the population to change over time.
This lab specifically deals with Wisconsin Fast Plants. In order to artificially select for certain traits, plants with the
desired traits can be crossed, changing the genetic makeup of the population. For example, if you wanted to select
for height, you could cross onl
