icrotubules of the spindle. To
advance scientific knowledge and determine which theory is correct,
three researchers carried out the following experiment.
First, they labeled the microtubules of a pig kidney cell in early
metaphase with yellow fluorescent dye (YFD). See Figure 1.
Next, they marked (M) an approximately 1.0 micron-wide band
across the spindle region of the microtubules between one spindle pole
and the chromosomes by using a laser to photobleach and eliminate the
YFD from that region. This left the microtubules intact. See Figure 2.
Figure 2
As anaphase continued, the researchers monitored the changes in
the microtubule length by measuring the length of the spindle on both
sides of the mark (M). Figure 3 shows the results of the experiment.
