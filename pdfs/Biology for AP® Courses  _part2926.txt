are pseudo-ruminants. They eat a lot of plant material and roughage. Digesting
plant material is not easy because plant cell walls contain the polymeric sugar molecule cellulose. The digestive enzymes of
these animals cannot break down cellulose, but microorganisms present in the digestive system can. Therefore, the digestive
system must be able to handle large amounts of roughage and break down the cellulose. Pseudo-ruminants have a three-
chamber stomach in the digestive system. However, their cecum—a pouched organ at the beginning of the large intestine
containing many microorganisms that are necessary for the digestion of plant materials—is large and is the site where the
roughage is fermented and digested. These animals do not have a rumen but have an omasum, abomasum, and reticulum.
Parts of the Digestive System
The vertebrate digestive system is designed to facilitate the transformation of food matter into the nutrient components that
sustain organisms.
