arating DNA fragments  
by size 
•  Using more sophisticated mathematical practices, such as plotting data using the  
log scale 
■ Potential Challenges 
A major challenge for teachers is determining what electrophoresis conditions (i.e., 
voltage and time) provide the best results for the particular type of equipment. Please 
make sure to check the manufacturer’s recommendations. 
The biggest challenge for students is loading the small DNA samples into the wells. To 
save time, money, and resources, students should practice using either the plastic needle-
nose pipettes provided or automatic pipettes before loading samples. Students will likely 
be a little nervous loading the samples, so you should show them how to use both hands 
to steady the pipette tip over the well. You should also caution students to not “punch 
through” the gel at the bottom of the well. 
•  Practice gels: The day before the lab, make one to two gels in a spare gel tray or 
rectangular plastic box using plain
