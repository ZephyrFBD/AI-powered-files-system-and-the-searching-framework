tial prey for some predatory birds that hunt during the day. Describe 
TWO features of a model that represents how the predator-prey relationship between the birds and 
the mice may have resulted in the evolution of the observed activity pattern of the mice. 
 
 
Description (1 point per box; 2 points maximum) 
Selective Advantage 
• 
Selection for individuals active at night 
• 
Selection against individuals active during the day 
• 
Day-active variants susceptible to predation  
• 
Night-active variants able to avoid predation 
Reproductive Success 
• 
Mice selected for produce more offspring 
• 
Mice selected against produce fewer offspring
