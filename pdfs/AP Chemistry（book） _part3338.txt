res to make electrical connec-
tions between the electrodes and the voltmeter. (a) Sketch out your 
voltaic cell labeling the metal used for each electrode and the type 
and concentration of the solutions in which each electrode is im-
mersed. Be sure to describe how many grams of the salt are dissolved 
and the total volume of solution in each beaker. (b) What will be 
the concentrations of the transition metal ion in each solution at 
the end of the 2-h discharge? (c) What voltage will the cell register 
at the end of the discharge? (d) How long would your cell run before 
it died because the reactant in one of the half-cells was completely 
consumed? Assume the current stays constant throughout the 
discharge.

Transformations of atomic nuclei are fittingly called nuclear reac-
tions. Some nuclei change spontaneously at room temperature, emit-
ting radiation. They are then said to be radioactive. As we will see, 
there are also other kinds of nuclear changes.
