Names and Formulas of Acids
Acids are an important class of hydrogen-containing compounds, and they are named in a 
special way. For our present purposes, an acid is a substance whose molecules yield hydrogen 
ions 1H+2 when dissolved in water. When we encounter the chemical formula for an acid at 
this stage of the course, it will be written with H as the first element, as in HCl and H2SO4.
An acid is composed of an anion connected to enough H+ ions to neutralize, or 
 
balance, the anionâ€™s charge. Thus, the SO4
2- ion requires two H+ ions, forming H2SO4. 
The name of an acid is related to the name of its anion, as summarized in Figure 2.25.
How to Name Acids
 
1. Acids containing anions whose names end in -ide are named by changing the -ide ending 
to -ic, adding the prefix hydro- to this anion name, and then following with the word acid:
