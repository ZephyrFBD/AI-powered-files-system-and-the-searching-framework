 substance is 
which, using concepts from this and earlier chapters.
(a) Assuming that you don’t have access to either the Internet or to 
a handbook of chemistry (as is the case during your exams!), design 
experiments that would allow you to identify the substances. 
 
(b) How might you proceed differently if you had access to data 
from the Internet? (c) Which of the substances could undergo re-
action to add more atoms around the central atom? What types 
of reactions might you choose to test this hypothesis? (d) Based 
on what you know about intermolecular forces, which of the sub-
stances is likely the solid?

However, not all animals have red blood. Some marine animals, includ-
ing octopuses, squids, and lobsters, have blue blood because they rely 
on a copper-containing protein called hemocyanine for transporting 
oxygen. In the deoxygenated state, hemocyanine contains two Cu+ 
ions separated from each other by over 4 Å, a distance too long to form 
a bond. When an oxygen mo
