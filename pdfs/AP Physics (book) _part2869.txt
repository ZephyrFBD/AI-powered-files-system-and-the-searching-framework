31. (I) What is the magnification of an astronomical telescope
whose objective lens has a focal length of 82 cm, and whose
eyepiece has a focal length of 2.8 cm? What is the overall
length of the telescope when adjusted for a relaxed eye?
32. (I) The overall magnification of an astronomical telescope
is desired to be
