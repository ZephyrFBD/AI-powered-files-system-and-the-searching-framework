ia took up the 
 
 attack, Oh, stop it,Angela, stop it.You have nobody to blame but yourself 
 
 for gettin’ into trouble with a drunkard from the North, a man that 
 
  
  
 doesn’t even look like a Catholic, him with his odd manner. I’d say 
 
 that . . . that . . . Malachy has a streak of the Presbyterian in him right 
 
 enough.You shuddup, Jimmy. 
 
 If I was you, said Philomena, I’d make sure there’s no more children. 
 
 He don’t have a job, so he don’t, an’ never will the way he drinks. So . . . 
 
 no more children,Angela.Are you listenin’ to me? 
 
 I am, Philomena. 
 
 A year later another child was born.Angela called him Malachy after his 
 
 father and gave him a middle name, Gerard, after his father’s brother. 
 
 The MacNamara sisters said Angela was nothing but a rabbit and 
 
 they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses. 
 
 Their husbands agreed. 
 
 I’m in a playground on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn with my brother, 
 
 Malachy. He’s two, I’m three.
