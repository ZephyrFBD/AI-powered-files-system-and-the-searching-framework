4. A species of sunflower was studied in the 1980s by Professor Telly of Calicat Research Labs. Native to
California, the C. harriehazelet sunflower blooms in late June and the blooms often draw photographers to the
coast for the gorgeous fields of yellow flowers following the Sun. Professor Telly was interested in the
preferences in soil moisture for the sunflower since California has often suffered extreme drought conditions
spurring wildfires. The sunflower population at nine different moisture levels is shown in Figure 1.

After 40 years, Professor Telly decided to revisit the sunflower blooms and measure the soil moisture content
at different sites again. It was discovered that sunflower species were primarily found at 2 tiers of moistu
