 so P = n
V RT 
[15.12]
The usual units for n>V are mol>L, which equals molarity, M. For substance A in our ge-
neric reaction, we therefore see that
 
P
A = nA
V RT = 3A4RT 
[15.13]
When we substitute Equation 15.13 and like expressions for the other gaseous com-
ponents of the reaction into Equation 15.11, we obtain a general expression relating 
Kp and Kc:
 
Kp =
13D4RT2d13E4RT2e
13A4RT2a13B4RT2b = £
3D4d3E4e
3A4a3B4b ≥ 
1RT2d + e
1RT2a + b 
[15.14]
Notice that the term in brackets is equal to Kc, so we can simplify the expression:
 
Kp = Kc1RT21d + e2 - 1a + b2 = Kc1RT2∆n 
[15.15]
The quantity ∆n is the change in the number of moles of gas in the balanced chemical 
equation. It equals the sum of the coefficients of the gaseous products minus the sum of 
the coefficients of the gaseous reactants:
 
∆n = 1moles of gaseous product2 - 1moles of gaseous reactant2 
[15.16]
For example, in the N2O41g2 ∆ 2 NO21g2 reaction, there are 2 mol of product NO2 
and 1 mol of reactant N2O4. Therefo
