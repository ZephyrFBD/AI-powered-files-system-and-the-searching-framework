28–7 Multielectron Atoms;
the Exclusion Principle
We have discussed the hydrogen atom in detail because it is the simplest to deal
with. Now we briefly discuss more complex atoms, those that contain more than
one electron. Their energy levels can be determined experimentally from an analysis
of their emission spectra. The energy levels are not the same as in the H atom,
because the electrons interact with each other as we
