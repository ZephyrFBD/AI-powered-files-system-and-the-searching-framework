ou heat a gas such 
as CO2, you will increase its degrees of translational, rota-
tional and vibrational motions. (c) CO21g2 and Ar(g) have 
nearly the same molar mass. At a given temperature, they 
will have the same number of microstates.
 19.39  For each of the following pairs, predict which substance 
has the higher entropy per mole at a given temperature: 
 
(a) Ar1l2 or Ar1g2, (b) He1g2 at 3 atm pressure or He1g2 
at 1.5 atm pressure, (c) 1 mol of Ne1g2 in 15.0 L or 1 mol of 
 
Ne1g2 in 1.50 L, (d) CO21g2 or CO21s2.
 19.40  For each of the following pairs, predict which substance 
possesses the larger entropy per mole: (a) 1 mol of O21g2 
at 300 °C, 0.01 atm, or 1 mol of O31g2 at 300 °C, 0.01 atm; 
(b) 1 mol of H2O1g2 at 100 °C, 1 atm, or 1 mol of H2O1l2 at 
100 °C, 1 atm; (c) 0.5 mol of N21g2 at 298 K, 20-L volume, or 
0.5 mol CH41g2 at 298 K, 20-L volume; (d) 100 g Na2SO41s2 
at 30 °C or 100 g Na2SO41aq2 at 30 °C.
