INTRODUCTION
hotosynthesis is the process by which light energy is converted to
chemical bond energy, and carbon is fixed into organic compounds. It
provides all the oxygen we breathe, the food we eat, and the fossil fuel we
consume. The general formula is:
6⁢CO2+12⁢H2O→lightC6⁢H12⁢O6+6⁢H2+6⁢O2

Photosynthesis is a reduction reaction because CO2 gains hydrogen from water.
There are two main processes of photosynthesis: the light-dependent and
the light-independent reactions. The light-dependent reactions use light
energy directly to produce ATP. The light-independent reactions consist of
the Calvin cycle, which produces sugar. To pow
