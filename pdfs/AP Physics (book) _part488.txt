5–5 Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation
Besides developing the three laws of motion, Isaac Newton also examined the motion
of the planets and the Moon. In particular, he wondered about the nature of the
force that must act to keep the Moon in its nearly circular orbit around the Earth.
Newton was also thinking about the problem of gravity. Since falling objects
accelerate, Newton had concluded that they must have a fo
