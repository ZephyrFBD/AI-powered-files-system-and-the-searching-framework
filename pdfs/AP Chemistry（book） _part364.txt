ing several oil drops for her measurements and calculated the 
charges on the drops. She obtained the following data:

2.7  Five of the boxes in the following periodic table are colored. 
Predict the charge on the ion associated with each of these 
elements. [Section 2.7]
 
2.8 The following diagram represents an ionic compound in 
which the red spheres represent cations and the blue spheres 
represent anions. Which of the following formulas is con-
sistent with the drawing? KBr, K2SO4, Ca1NO322, Fe21SO423. 
Name the compound. [Sections 2.7 and 2.8]

 2.10 In the Millikan oil-drop experiment (see Figure 2.5), the tiny 
oil drops are observed through the viewing lens as rising, 
stationary, or falling, as shown here. (a) What ca
