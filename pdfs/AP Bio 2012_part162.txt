 
Question 59
Essential Knowledge
4.A.3: Interactions between external stimuli and regulated 
gene expression result in specialization of cells, tissues, 
and organs. 
Science Practice
1.3: The student can refine representations and models  
of natural or man-made phenomena and systems in  
the domain.
Learning Objective 
4.7: The student is able to refine representations to 
illustrate how interactions between external stimuli and 
gene expression result in specialization of cells, tissues, 
and organs. 
(A)
This option is correct because free calcium is needed for heterocyst formation. 
Binding the calcium will prevent cyst formation. This answer demonstrates 
that the student is able to refine representations to illustrate how interactions 
between external stimuli and gene expression result in specialization of cells.
(B)
This option is incorrect because the patS gene inhibits heterocyst formation, so 
fewer would be produced.
(C)
This option is incorrect because in an environment
