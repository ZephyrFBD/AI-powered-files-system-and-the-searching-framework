llosteric sites for the RZN45 to bind to.
(C) At high concentrations of JB-76, there are more free allosteric sites for the ascorbic acid to bind to.
(D) At low concentrations of JB-76, there are more free active sites for the RZN45 to bind to.
8. A patient with Ritzolierreâ€™s Disease would likely benefit from which of the following:
  I. Injections of RZN45
 II. Injections of JB-76
III. Injections of ascorbic acid
(A) I only
(B) II only
(C) III only
(D) II and III
9. If Figure 1 were to include additional data for higher concentrations of JB-76, how would the reaction rate
change?
(A) The reaction rate would be lower than any reaction rate shown in Figure 1.
(B) The reaction rate would be higher than any reaction rate shown in Figure 1.
(C) The reaction rate would be equal to the highest reaction rate shown in Figure 1.
(D) The reaction rate would increase gradually for each concentration of JB-76 added.
10. The Galapagos Islands contain about 15 species of finches that vary in terms o
