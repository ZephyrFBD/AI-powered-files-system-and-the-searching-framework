Each vertebral body has a large hole in the center through which the nerves of the spinal cord pass. There is also a notch on
each side through which the spinal nerves, which serve the body at that level, can exit from the spinal cord. The vertebral
column is approximately 71 cm (28 inches) in adult male humans and is curved, which can be seen from a side view. The
names of the spinal curves correspond to the region of the spine in which they occur. The thoracic and sacral curves are
concave (curve inwards relative to the front of the body) and the cervical and lumbar curves are convex (curve outwards
relative to the front of the body). The arched curvature of the vertebral column increases its strength and flexibility, allowing
it to absorb shocks like a spring (Figure 29
