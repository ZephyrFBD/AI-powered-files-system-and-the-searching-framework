Polymers of other chemical compositions provide still greater variety in physical 
and chemical properties. Table 12.6 lists several other common polymers obtained by 
addition polymerization.
A second general reaction used to synthesize commercially important polymers is 
condensation polymerization. In a condensation reaction two molecules are joined 
to form a larger molecule by elimination of a small molecule, such as H2O. For example, an 
amine (a compound containing ¬NH2) reacts with a carboxylic acid (a compound con-
taining ¬COOH) to form a bond between N and C plus an H2O molecule (Figure 12.36).
Polymers formed from two different monomers are called copolymers. In the for-
mation of many nylons, a diamine, a compound with the ¬NH2 group at each end, is 
reacted with a diacid, a compound with the ¬COOH group at each end. For example, 
the copolymer nylon 6,6 is formed when a diamine that has six carbon atoms and an 
amino group on each end is reacted with adipic a
