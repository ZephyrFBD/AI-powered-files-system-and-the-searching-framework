I and a group V element such as gallium and arsenic
Remarkably, GaAs has a crystal structure very
similar to Si. See Fig. 29–33. For doping of GaAs, group VI atoms (like Se) can
serve as donors, and group II atoms (valence 
, such as Zn) as acceptors. The
energy gap for GaAs is 
corresponding to near-infrared photons
with wavelength 870 nm (almost visible). Such infrared LEDs are suitable for use in
remote-control devices for TVs, DVD players, stereos, car door locks, and so on.
The first visible-light LED, developed in the early 1960s, was made of a semi-
conductor compound of gallium, arsenic, and phosphorus 
which
emitted red light. The red LED soon found use as the familiar indicator lights
(on–off) on electronic devices, and as the bright red read-out on calculators and
