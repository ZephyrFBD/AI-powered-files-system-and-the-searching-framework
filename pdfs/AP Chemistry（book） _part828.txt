e separated 
by a distance of 0.35 nm. How much work would be required to 
increase the separation of the two ions to an infinite distance?
 5.19 Identify the force present and explain whether work is being 
performed in the following cases: (a) You lift a pencil off the top 
of a desk. (b) A spring is compressed to half its normal length.
 5.20 Identify the force present and explain whether work is done 
when (a) a positively charged particle moves in a circle at a 
fixed distance from a negatively charged particle, (b) an iron 
nail is pulled off a magnet.
 5.10 The gas-phase reaction shown, between N2 and O2, was run 
in an apparatus designed to maintain a constant pressure. 
(a) Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction de-
picted and predict whether w is positive, negative, or zero. 
(b) Using data from Appendix C, determine âˆ†H for the for-
mation of one mole of the product. [Sections 5.3 and 5.7]
 5.11 Consider the two diagrams that follow. (a) Based on (i), write 
an e
