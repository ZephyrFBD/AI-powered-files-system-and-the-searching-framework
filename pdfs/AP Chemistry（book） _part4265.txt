absolute zero The temperature at which all thermal motion 
ceases: 0 K on the Kelvin scale and -273.15 °C on the Celsius 
scale. (Section 1.5)
absorption spectrum A pattern of variation in the amount 
of light absorbed by a sample as a function of wavelength. 
(Section 23.5)
accuracy A measure of how closely individual measurements 
agree with the correct, or “true,” value. (Section 1.6)
acid A substance that is able to donate a H+ ion (a proton) and, 
hence, increases the concentration of H+1aq2 when it dissolves in 
water. (Section 4.3)
acid-dissociation constant (Ka) An equilibrium constant that 
expresses the extent to which an acid transfers a proton to 
solvent water. (Section 16.6)
acidic anhydride (acidic oxide) An oxide that forms an acid 
when added to water; soluble nonmetal oxides are acidic 
anhydrides. (Section 22.5)
acidic oxide (acidic anhydride) An oxide that reacts either with 
a base to form a salt or with water to form an acid. (Section 22.5)
