on in a car going around a
curve (Fig. 5–11) from the point of view of an inertial frame. The car, on the other
hand, is not an inertial frame. Passengers in such a car could interpret this being
pressed outward as the effect of a “centrifugal” force. But they need to recognize
that it is a pseudoforce because there is no identifiable object exerting it. It is 
an effect of being in a noninertial frame of reference.
The Earth itself is rotating on its axis. Thus, strictly speaking, Newton’s laws
are not valid on the Earth. However, the effect of the Earth’s rotation is usually
so small that it can be ignored, although it does influence the movement of large
air masses and ocean currents. Because of the Earth’s rotation, the material of
the Earth is concentrated slightly more at the equator. The Earth is thus not a
perfect sphere but is slightly fatter at the equator than at the poles.
