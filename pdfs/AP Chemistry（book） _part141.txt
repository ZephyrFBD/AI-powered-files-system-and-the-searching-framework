1.4 ∣ The Nature of Energy
All objects in the universe are made of matter, but matter alone is not enough to describe 
the behavior of the world around us. The water in an alpine lake and a pot of boiling wa-
ter are both made from the same substance, but your body will experience a very different 
sensation if you put your hand in each. The difference between the two is their energy con-
tent; boiling water has more energy than chilled water. To understand chemistry, we must 
also understand energy and the changes in energy that accompany chemical processes.
Unlike matter, energy does not have mass and cannot be held in our hands, but its 
effects can be observed and measured. Energy is defined as the capacity to do work or trans-
fer heat. Work is the energy transferred when a force exerted on an object causes a displacement 
of that object, and heat is the energy used to cause the temperature of an obje
