ydrogen atom is 1312 kJ>mol, whereas 
that of lithium is 520 kJ>mol.
Hydrogen is sometimes placed above the halogens in the periodic table because 
the hydrogen atom can pick up one electron to form the hydride ion, H -, which has 
the same electron configuration as helium. However, the electron affinity of hydrogen, 
EA = -73 kJ>mol, is not as large as that of any halogen. In general, hydrogen shows no 
closer resemblance to the halogens than it does to the alkali metals.
Elemental hydrogen exists at room temperature as a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas 
composed of diatomic molecules. We can call H2 dihydrogen, but it is more commonly 
referred to as either molecular hydrogen or simply hydrogen. Because H2 is nonpolar and 
has only two electrons, attractive forces between molecules are extremely weak. As a 
result, its melting point 1-259 °C2 and boiling point 1-253 °C2 are very low.
The H¬H bond enthalpy 1436 kJ>mol2 is high for a single bond.
