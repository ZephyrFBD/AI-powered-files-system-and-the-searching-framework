three regions 
based on wavelength: UV-A (315–400 nm), UV-B (280–315 
nm), and UV-C (100–280 nm). (a) Photons from which 
region have the highest energy and therefore are the most 
harmful to living tissue? (b) In the absence of ozone, which 
of these three regions, if any, are absorbed by the atmo-
sphere? (c) When appropriate concentrations of ozone are 
present in the stratosphere, is all of the UV light absorbed 
before reaching the Earth’s surface? If not, which region or 
regions are not filtered out?

 18.23  Do the reactions involved in ozone depletion involve 
changes in oxidation state of the O atoms? Explain.
 18.24  Which of the following reactions in the stratosphere cause 
an increase in temperature there?

(b) O3*1g2 + M1g2 ¡ O31g2 + M*1g2
(c) O21g2 + hn ¡ 2 O1g2
(d) O1g2 + N21g2 ¡ NO1g2 + N1g2
