 genes on the homologs align with each other. At this stage,
segments of homologous chromosomes exchange linear segments of genetic material (Figure 12.18). This process is called
recombination, or crossover, and it is a common genetic process. Because the genes are aligned during recombination, the
gene order is not altered. Instead, the result of recombination is that maternal and paternal alleles are combined onto the
same chromosome. Across a given chromosome, several recombination events may occur, causing extensive shuffling of
alleles.

Figure 12.18 The process of crossover, or recombination, occurs when two homologous chromosomes align during
meiosis and exchange a segment of genetic material. Here, the alleles for gene C were exchanged. The result is two
recombinant and two non-recombinant chromosomes.
When two genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome, they are considered linked, and their alleles
tend to be
