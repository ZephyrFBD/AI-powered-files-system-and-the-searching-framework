is negatively charged due to the negatively charged phosphate groups in nucleotides. When an electric
voltage is applied, DNA fragments are attracted to the positively charged end of the voltage field. As a result, the
fragments move across the gel, but because larger, heavier fragments move more slowly than smaller, lighter
fragments, the various fragments in the sample DNA are separated.
A Typical Answer to Long Question
Question 1
a.
 
b. In treatment II, the chloroplasts were boiled. Boiling damages the chloroplasts, disrupting the thylakoid
membranes. Also, the enzymes and photosynthetic pigments imbedded in the membranes are denatured. When these
molecules lose their secondary and tertiary structures, they can no longer function properly. As a result,
photosynthesis in treatment II is greatly reduced, occurring only in those few membranes that may still be intact with
functioning enzymes and pigments. Only a small amount of DPIP is reduced, and the transmittance of a treatment II
