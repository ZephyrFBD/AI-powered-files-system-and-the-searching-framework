the slope of a mountain, known as an altitudinal cline.
If there is gene flow between the populations, the individuals will likely show gradual differences in phenotype along the
cline. Restricted gene flow, on the other hand, can lead to abrupt differences, even speciation.

Lab Investigation
AP® Biology Investigative Labs: Inquiry-Based Approach, Investigation 1: Artificial Selection. Using
Wisconsin Fast Plants, you explore evolution by conducting an artificial selection investigation to increase
or decrease genetic variation in a population and then determine if extreme selection can change the
expression of a quantitative trait.
Think About It
•
Do you think genetic drift would happen more quickly on an island or on the mainland? Provide reasoning for
your answer.

Consider the population of red and blue flowers you analyzed in Section 1 to determine if the
