ng four oxygen molecules is
bright red, while venous blood that is deoxygenated is darker red.
Figure 30.19 The protein inside (a) red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells and carbon dioxide to the lungs is (b)
hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is made up of four symmetrical subunits and four heme groups. Iron associated with the
heme binds oxygen. It is the iron in hemoglobin that gives blood its red color.
It is easier to bind a second and third oxygen molecule to Hb than the first molecule. This is because the hemoglobin
molecule changes its shape, or conformation, as oxygen binds. The fourth oxygen is then more difficult to bind. The binding
of oxygen to hemoglobin can be plotted as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (x-axis) versus the
relative Hb-oxygen saturation (y-axis). The resulting graph—an oxygen dissociation curve—is sigmoidal, or S-shaped
(Figure 30.20). As the partial pressure of oxygen increases, the hemoglobin becomes increasingly saturated with oxygen
