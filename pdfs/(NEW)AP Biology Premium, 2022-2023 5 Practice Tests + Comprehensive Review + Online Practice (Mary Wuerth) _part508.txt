, the direction of the coil of the shell is controlled by a single gene. Snails with left-
coiling shells cannot mate with snails with right-coiling shells because their copulating organs do not
align.
(C) The fruit fly species Drosophila persimilis breeds in the early morning, and the fruit fly species Drosophila
pseudoobscura breeds in the late afternoon.
(D) The bullfrog species Rana draytonii and Rana catesbeiana can mate and produce a zygote, but the zygote
is not viable.
10. Tigers (Panthera tigris) and leopards (Panthera pardus) can mate and produce a zygote. The zygote will
undergo cell division a few times, but this fails to result in the production of a viable embryo. This is an
example of which type of reproductive isolation?
(A) gametic
(B) reduced hybrid viability
(C) reduced hybrid fertility
(D) hybrid breakdown
