 radius?
2. On what factors does the periodicity of the Periodic Table
depend? Consider the exclusion principle, quantization of
angular momentum, spin, and any others you can think of.
3. As discussed in Section 28–5: (a) List two aspects of the
Bohr model that the quantum-mechanical theory of the
atom retained. (b) Give one major difference between the
Bohr model and the quantum-mechanical theory of the atom.
4. Estimate (a) the quantum number for the orbital angular
momentum of the Earth about the Sun, and (b) the number
of possible orientations for the plane of Earth’s orbit.
5. Show that the diffraction spread of a laser beam,
(Section 28–11), is precisely what you might expect from
the uncertainty principle. See also Chapters 24 and 25.
[Hint: Since the beam’s width is constrained by the dimen-
sion of the aperture D, the component of the light’s
momentum perpendicular to the laser axis is uncertain.]
