 up tails? This outcome can be
achieved by two cases: the penny may be heads (PH) and the quarter may be tails (QT), or the quarter may be heads (QH)
and the penny may be tails (PT). Either case fulfills the outcome. By the sum rule, we calculate the probability of obtaining
one head and one tail as [(PH) × (QT)] + [(QH) × (PT)] = [(1/2) × (1/2)] + [(1/2) × (1/2)] = 1/2 (Table 12.3). You should also
notice that we used the product rule to calculate the probability of PH and QT, and also the probability of PT and QH, before
we summed them. Again, the sum rule can be applied to show the probability of having just one dominant trait in the F2
generation of a dihybrid cross:

For independent events A and B, the probability (P)
of them both occurring (A and B) is (PA × PB)
For mutually exclusive events A and B, the probability
(P) that at least one occurs (A or B) is (PA + PB)
