ion of a
lens. In Fig. 24–21 we saw that the diffraction pattern produced by light passing
through a rectangular slit has a central maximum in which most of the light falls. This
central peak falls to a minimum on either side of its center at an angle given by
(this is Eq. 24–3a), where D is the slit width and 
the wavelength of light used.
is
the angular half-width of the central maximum, and for small angles (in radians)
can be written
There are also low-intensity fringes beyond.
For a lens, or any circular hole, the image of a point object will consist of a
circular central peak (called the diffraction spot or Airy disk) surrounded by faint
circular fringes, as shown in Fig. 25–29a. The central maximum has an angular
half-width given by
where D is the diameter of the circular opening. [This is a theoretical result for a
perfect circle or lens. For real lenses or circles, the factor is on the order of 1 to 2.]
This formula differs from that for a slit (Eq. 24–3) by the factor 1.22. T
