PRACTICE TEST 2 EXPLANATIONS
Section I: Multiple Choice
1.
D
Because of the cell wall, a plant cell will not lyse when placed in a hypotonic solution. Instead, it will just
swell. Both plant and animal cells perform cellular respiration, (A), and have transcription factors, (B),
and both have vacuoles, (C).
2.
C
If the contents of the cell separated from the cell wall, then water was moving out of the cell. This would
cause the space between the cell wall and the cell membrane to expand, so eliminate (B). This also means
that the concentration of solutes in the extracellular environment would be hypertonic with respect to the
cellâ€™s interior. You can also eliminate (A) because the fluid in the cell was hypotonic to the sugar
solution; fluid was moving out of the vacuole, which caused it to become smaller. Choice (C) is the
correct answer because if the water was rushing out of
