als the actual

minus the buoyant force 
so
Let V be the volume of the completely submerged object and 
the object’s
density (so 
is its mass), and let 
be the density of the fluid (water). Then
is the weight of fluid displaced
Now we can write
We divide these two equations and obtain
We see that
is equal to the specific gravity of the object (the crown)
if the fluid in which it is submerged is water 
Thus
This corresponds to a density of 
The crown is not gold, but seems
to be made of lead (see Table 10–1).
