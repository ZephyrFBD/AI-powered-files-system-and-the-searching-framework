C. Describe the questions that must be addressed for
panspermia to be a scientific hypothesis about the origin of
life on Earth and describe the reasons for the directed
panspermia revision of this hypothesis.
To avoid the conflicting chicken-and-egg claims that
“protein catalyst was first” and “DNA information storage
was first,” two alternatives have emerged regarding the
origin of life on Earth. Consider two simple ideas: 1) water
blocks uv radiation, and cracks in the ocean floor (hot
vents) provide a temperature difference that generates a
source of entropy; and 2) ribosomes are composed of
RNA.
D. Describe one of the following as a hypothesis
concerning the origin of life on Earth:
•
Reactions among molecules in the vicinity of hot
vents became organized in space and time, eventually
developing structures that foreshadow the proton
gradient upon which metabolism is based. This
alternative is the basis for what is referred to as the
metabolism-first hypothesis.
