olecule during
fermentation. Why does aerobic respiration produce significantly
more ATP per glucose molecule than fermentation?
Aerobic respiration uses glycolysis to oxidize glucose.
(A)
Oxygen is necessary to release energy stored in pyruvate.
(B)
Fermentation uses NAD+ as the oxidizing agent in glycolysis.
(C)
It requires energy to transport molecules into mitochondria.

50. A certain species of bird has beaks of variable length, with an
average length of 10 centimeters and a standard deviation of 2
centimeters. It feeds primarily on a species of insect that burrows
underground, with most of the insects located 8 to 10 centimeters
beneath the surface. If the insect starts burrowing to a greater
depth, which of the following population distributions for beak
length is most likely to result?
A mean of 10 centimeters with a standard deviation of 4
centimeters 
(A)
A mean of 8 centimeters with a standard deviation of 2
centimeters
(B)
A mean of 12 centimeters with a standard deviati
