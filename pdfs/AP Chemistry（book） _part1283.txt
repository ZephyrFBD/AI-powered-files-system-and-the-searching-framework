tructure shown (and 
the similar one that has a triple bond to the left O and a single bond to the right O) con-
tribute to the actual structure to a much smaller extent.
Although the concept of formal charge helps us to arrange alternative Lewis struc-
tures in order of importance, it is important to remember that formal charges do not rep-
resent real charges on atoms. These charges are just a bookkeeping convention. The actual 
charge distributions in molecules and ions are determined not by formal charges but by a 
number of other factors, including electronegativity differences between atoms.
Give It Some Thought
Suppose a Lewis structure for a neutral fluorine-containing molecule results in a 
formal charge of +1 on the fluorine atom. What conclusion would you draw?
Three possible Lewis structures for the thiocyanate ion, NCS-, are
(a) Neutral N, C, and S atoms have five, four, and six valence electrons, 
respectively. We can determine the formal charges in the three 
structures
