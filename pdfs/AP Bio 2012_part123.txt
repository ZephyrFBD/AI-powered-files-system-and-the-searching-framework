Science Practice
5.1: The student can analyze data to identify patterns  
or relationships.
Learning Objective 
2.24: The student is able to analyze data to identify 
possible patterns and relationships between a biotic or 
abiotic factor and a biological system (cells, organisms, 
populations, communities, or ecosystems).
(A)
This option is incorrect. Shortening of cells in response to a lack of light would 
result in slower growth, but this claim is not supported by the data.
(B)
This option is correct. In response to the lack of light, the plant elongates cells 
in an attempt to reach light necessary for photosynthesis at the expense of  
leaf development.
(C)
This option is incorrect. In the seeds that were exposed to light, the plants  
actually grew more slowly, so enhancement of stem elongation is not supported  
by the data.
(D)
This option is incorrect because genetic differences were accounted for by using 
20 seeds each from the same species.
