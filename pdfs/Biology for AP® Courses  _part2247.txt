Two Options for Similarities
In general, organisms that share similar physical features and genomes tend to be more closely related than those that do
not. Such features that overlap both morphologically (in form) and genetically are referred to as homologous structures;
they stem from developmental similarities that are based on evolution. For example, the bones in the wings of bats and birds
have homo
