is thought to oc-
cur by the following two-step mechanism.
Step 1: 
O31g2 ∆O21g2 + O1g2 (fast)
Step 2:  
O1g2 + O31g2 ¡ 2 O21g2 (slow)
 
 (a) Write the balanced equation for the overall reaction. 
(b) Derive the rate law that is consistent with this mecha-
nism. (Hint: The product appears in the rate law.) (c) Is O 
a catalyst or an intermediate? (d) If instead the reaction 
occurred in a single step, would the rate law change? If so, 
what would it be?
[14.110] The following mechanism has been proposed for the gas-
phase reaction of chloroform 1CHCl32 and chlorine:

 (a) What is the overall reaction? (b) What are the intermedi-
ates in the mechanism? (c) What is the molecularity of each 
of the elementary reactions? (d) What is the rate-determining 
step? (e) What is the rate law predicted by this mechanism? 
(Hint: The overall reaction order is n
