ength of the unit cell edge is 5.852 Å. 
 
(a) Calculate the density of HgS in this form. (b) The min-
eral tiemannite (HgSe) also forms a solid phase with the zinc 
blende structure. The length of the unit cell edge in this 
mineral is 6.085 Å. What accounts for the larger unit cell 
length in tiemmanite? (c) Which of the two substances has 
the higher density? How do you account for the difference 
in densities?
 12.62  At room temperature and pressure RbI crystallizes with the 
NaCl-type structure. (a) Use ionic radii to predict the length of 
the cubic unit cell edge. (b) Use this value to estimate the den-
sity. (c) At high pressure the structure transforms to one with 
a CsCl-type structure. (c) Use ionic radii to predict the length 
of the cubic unit cell edge for the high-pressure form of RbI. 
 
(d) Use this value to estimate the density. How does this den-
sity compare with the density you calculated in part (b)?
 12.63  CuI, CsI, and NaI each adopt a different type of struc-
