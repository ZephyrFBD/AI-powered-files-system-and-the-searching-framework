ight contain
about 4000 pixels horizontally by 3000 pixels vertically over an area of perhaps
and preferably larger such as 
like 35-mm film. Light
reaching any pixel liberates electrons within the semiconductor‡ which are stored
as charge in that pixel’s capacitance. The more intense the light, the more charge 
accumulates during the brief exposure time. After exposure, the charge on each
pixel has to be “read” (measured) and stored. A reader circuit first reads the
charge on the pixel capacitance right next to it. Immediately after, the charge on
each pixel is electronically transferred to its adjacent pixel, towards the reader
which reads each pixel charge in sequence, one-by-one. Hence the name 
“charge-coupled device.” All this information (the brightness of each pixel) goes to
a central processor that stores it and allows re-formation of the image later onto
the camera’s screen, a computer screen, or a printer. After all the pixel charge
information is transferred to memory (Sect
