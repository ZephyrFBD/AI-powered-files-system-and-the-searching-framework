its mass in grams (the unknown).
(2) We have the following conversion factors either given, commonly known, or 
available on the back inside cover of the text:
1.00 g water
1 mL water 
1 L
1000 mL 
1 L
1.057 qt 
1 gal
4 qt
The first of these conversion factors must be used as written (with grams in the  
numerator) to give the desired result, whereas the last conversion factor must be  
inverted in order to cancel gallons:
 Mass in grams = 11.00 gal2a
4 qt
1 gal b a
1 L
1.057 qtb a 1000 mL
1 L
b a
1.00 g
1 mL b
 = 3.78 * 103 g water
The unit of our final answer is appropriate, and we have taken care 
of our significant figures. We can further check our calculation 
by estimating. We can round 1.057 off to 1. Then focusing on the 
numbers that do not equal 1 gives 4 * 1000 = 4000 g, in agree-
ment with the detailed calculation.
You should also use common sense to assess the rea-
sonableness of your answer. In this case we know that most 
people can lift a gallon of milk with one hand, a
