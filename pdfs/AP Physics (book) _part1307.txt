12–5 Quality of Sound, and Noise;
Superposition
Whenever we hear a sound, particularly a musical sound, we are aware of its
loudness, its pitch, and also of a third aspect called “quality.” For example, when a
piano and then a flute play a note of the same loudness and pitch (say, middle C),
there is a clear difference in the overa
