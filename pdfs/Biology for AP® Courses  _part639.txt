tosis,
whereas opsonin reverses the process of
phagocytosis.
b.
Opsonins are proteins that enhance
phagocytosis, whereas clathrin opposes
phagocytosis.
c.
Opsonin stabilizes the inward facing surface of
the plasma membrane, which engulfs the
antigen, whereas clathrin marks the antigen for
phagocytosis by neutrophils.
d.
Opsonin marks the antigen for phagocytosis by
neutrophils, whereas clathrin stabilizes the
inward facing surface of the plasma membrane,
which engulfs the antigen.

39. Membrane fluidity is influenced by the number of C-C
double bonds (unsaturation) in the hydrocarbon tails of the
lipids composing cell membranes. Fluidity is also
dependent on temperature. The transit of materials through
the cell membrane is controlled by fluidity. To
