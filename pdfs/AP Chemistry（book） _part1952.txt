How many bonds does each carbon 
atom in C60 make? Based on this 
observation, would you expect the 
bonding in C60 to be more like that 
in diamond or that in graphite?
▲ Figure 12.49 Buckminsterfullerene, 
C60. The molecule has a highly symmetric 
structure in which the 60 carbon 
atoms sit at the vertices of a truncated 
icosahedron. The bottom view shows only 
the bonds between carbon atoms.

CHAPTER 12 Solids and Modern Materials
Soon after the discovery of C60, chemists discovered carbon nanotubes (Figure 12.50). 
You can think of these as sheets of graphite rolled up and capped at one or both ends by 
half of a C60 molecule. Carbon nanotubes are made in a manner similar to that used to 
make C60. They can be made in either multiwall or single-walled forms. Multiwall carbon 
nanotubes consist of tubes within tubes, nested together, whereas single-walled carbon 
nanotubes consist of single tubes. Single-walled carbon nanotub
