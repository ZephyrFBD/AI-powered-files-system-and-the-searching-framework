me that this quantity of Cl2 is dissolved and equili-
brated as follows:
Cl21aq2 + H2O ∆ Cl -1aq2 + HClO1aq2 + H+1aq2
 
 (a) If the equilibrium constant for this reaction is 
4.7 * 10 - 4, calculate the equilibrium concentration of 
HClO formed. (b) What is the pH of the ﬁnal solution?
 [22.96]  When ammonium perchlorate decomposes thermally, 
the products of the reaction are N21g2, O21g2, H2O1g2, and 
HCl(g). (a) Write a balanced equation for the reaction. (Hint: 
You might ﬁnd it easier to use fractional coefficients for the 
products.) (b) Calculate the enthalpy change in the reac-
tion per mole of NH4ClO4. The standard enthalpy of for-
mation of NH4ClO41s2 is -295.8 kJ. (c) When NH4ClO41s2 
is employed in solid-fuel booster rockets, it is packed with 
powdered aluminum. Given the high temperature needed 
for NH4ClO41s2 decomposition and what the products of 
the reaction are, what role does the aluminum play? (d) Cal-
