(See Equations 5.29 and 5.30.)
Plan (a) We first write the balanced equation for the combustion of 
C6H6. We then look up ∆Hf° values in Appendix C or in Table 5.3 
and apply Equation 5.31 to calculate the enthalpy change for the 
reaction. (b) We use the molar mass of C6H6 to change the enthalpy 
change per mole to that per gram. We similarly use the molar mass of 
C3H8 and the enthalpy change per mole calculated in the text previ-
ously to calculate the enthalpy change per gram of that substance.
Solve
(a)  
We know that a combustion reaction involves O21g2 as a reactant. 
Thus, the balanced equation for the combustion reaction of  
1 mol C6H61l2 is:
C6H61l2 + 15
2  O21g2 ¡  6 CO21g2 + 3 H2O1l2

The energy changes that accompany chemical reactions are closely related to the changes 
associated with forming and breaking chemical bonds—breaking bonds requires energy 
and forming bonds releases energy.
