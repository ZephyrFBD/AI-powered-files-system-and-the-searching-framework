photon must have energy
A photon with less energy cannot undergo
pair production.
(b) Since
the wavelength of a 1.02-MeV photon is
which is 0.0012 nm. Such photons are in the gamma-ray (or very short X-ray)
region of the electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 22–8).
NOTE Photons of higher energy (shorter wavelength) can also create an electron–
positron pair, with the excess energy becoming kinetic energy of the particles.
Pair production cannot occur in empty space, for momentum could not be con-
served. In Example 27–9, for instance, energy is conserved, but only enough energy
was provided to create the electron–positron pair at rest and thus with zero momen-
tum, which could not equal the initial momentum of the photon. Indeed, it can be
shown that at any energy, an additional massive object, such as an atomic nucleus
(Fig. 27–10), must take part in the interaction to carry off some of the momentum.
