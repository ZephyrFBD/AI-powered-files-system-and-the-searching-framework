Punnett square for this cross. There are 16 squares; therefore, all the ratios
are out of 16.
Obviously, many different genotypes are possible in the resulting F2
generation, but you need not pay attention to them. Just pay attention to
the phenotype ratio of the dihybrid cross. It is 9:3:3:1â€”9 tall, yellow; 3

BEYOND MENDELIAN INHERITANCE
Mendelian principles apply to traits determined by a single gene for which
there are only two alleles. An example is height in pea plants (one gene),
which has only two alleles (tall and short). Now we will consider
situations in which two or more genes are involved in determining a
particular phenotype.
IST-1
The inheritance pattern of many traits cannot be explained by simple Mendelian
inheritance.
