Plants utilize solar energy in photosynthesis, the reaction in which the energy of sun-
light is used to convert CO2 and H2O into carbohydrates and O2:
 
6 CO21g2 + 6 H2O1l2 + sunlight ¡  C6H12O61s2 + 6 O21g2 
[5.34]
Photosynthesis is an important part of Earth’s ecosystem because it replenishes atmo-
spheric O2, produces an energy-rich molecule that can be used as fuel, and consumes 
some atmospheric CO2.
Perhaps the most direct way to use the Sun’s energy is to convert it directly into elec-
tricity in photovoltaic devices, or solar cells, which we mentioned at the beginning of this 
chapter. The efficiencies of such devices have increased dramatically during the past few 
years. Technological advances have led to solar panels th
