es,
the closer their degree of relatedness. In a phylogenetic tree, the outgroup is the least closely related member of the
tree. The root of a phylogenetic tree represents the common ancestor of all members of the tree.
Figure 21.1 Phylogenetic Tree
In Figure 21.1, points A, B, C, and D represent nodes that indicate common ancestors. Point A represents the
common ancestor of birds and reptiles, and point C represents the common ancestor of amphibians, birds, reptiles,
and mammals. The phylogenetic tree indicates that birds and reptiles are more closely related than birds and
amphibians because birds and reptiles share a more recent common ancestor (at point A) than do birds and
amphibians (at point C). Keratinous scales are a shared derived characteristic that separate birds and reptiles into a
clade. Keratinous scales are a characteristic shared by birds and reptiles that other organisms in this phylogenetic
tree do not possess. Lampreys are the least closely related member of this p
