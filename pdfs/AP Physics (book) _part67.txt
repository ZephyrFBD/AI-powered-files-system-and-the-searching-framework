 of view a new theory may often seem to be only
a minor advance over the old one. For example, Einstein’s theory of relativity
gives predictions that differ very little from the older theories of Galileo and
Newton in nearly all everyday situations. Its predictions are better mainly in the
extreme case of very high speeds close to the speed of light. But quantitative
prediction is not the only important outcome of a theory. Our view of the world
is affected as well. As a result of Einstein’s theory of relativity, for example, our
concepts of space and time have been completely altered, and we have come to
see mass and energy as a single entity (via the famous equation
).
1–2 Physics and its Relation to
Other Fields
For a long time science was more or less a united whole known as natural
philosophy. Not until a century or two ago did the distinctions between physics
and chemistry and even the life sciences become prominent. Indeed, the sharp
distinction we now see between the arts and t
