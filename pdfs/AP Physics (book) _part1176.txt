uency f of the external force, even if this frequency is different from the natural
frequency of the spring, which we will now denote by 
where (see Eq. 11–6b)
For a forced oscillation with only light damping, the amplitude of oscillation
is found to depend on the difference between f and 
and is a maximum when
the frequency of the external force equals the natural frequency of the system—
that is, when
The amplitude is plotted in Fig. 11–18 as a function of the
external frequency f. Curve A represents light damping and curve B heavy damp-
ing. When the external driving frequency f is near the natural frequency,
the amplitude can become large if the damping is small. This effect of increased
amplitude at 
is known as resonance. The natural oscillation frequency 
of a system is also called its resonant frequency.
A simple illustration of resonance is pushing a child on a swing. A swing, like
any pendulum, has a natural frequency of oscillation. If you push on the swing at
a random frequ
