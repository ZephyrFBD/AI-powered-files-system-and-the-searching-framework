5. The final step normally involves treating the water with a chemical agent to ensure 
the destruction of bacteria. Ozone is more effective, but chlorine is less expensive. 
Liquefied Cl2 is dispensed from tanks through a metering device directly into the 
water supply. The amount used depends on the presence of other substances with 
which the chlorine might react and on the concentrations of bacteria and viruses to 
be removed.
The sterilizing action of chlorine is not due to Cl2 itself but to hypochlorous acid, 
which forms when chlorine reacts with water:
 
Cl21aq2 + H2O1l2 ¡ HClO1aq2 + H+1aq2 + Cl-1aq2 
[18.15]
It is estimated that about 800 million people worldwide lack access to clean water.
