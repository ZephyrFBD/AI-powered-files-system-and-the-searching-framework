50. (D) The number of individuals is reaching its maximum at point D, which represents the carrying capacity of
the environment. Choices (A) and (B) represent the lag phase of growth and are therefore incorrect. Choice (C)
is when the rate of population growth is the greatest, which is exponential growth. Thus, choice (C) does not
represent the carrying capacity and is therefore incorrect.
51. (C) Exponential growth is when the rate of population growth is the greatest. On this graph, exponential growth
is shown at point C. Choices (A) and (B) represent points during the lag phase of growth, so those choices are
incorrect. The carrying capacity of the environment is represented by point D, so choice (D) is incorrect.
52. (C) Mutualism is a type of symbiotic relationship that results when both organisms benefit: the clown fish is
protected from predators, and the sea anemone gains access to prey that is attracted to the clown fish.
Commensalism is when one member benefits and the other
