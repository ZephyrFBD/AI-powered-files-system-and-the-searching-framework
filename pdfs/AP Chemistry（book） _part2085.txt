 any 
aqueous solution that is 1 m in nonvolatile solute particles is 0.51 °C higher than the 
boiling point of pure water. Because solutions generally do not behave ideally, the con-
stants listed in Table 13.3 serve well only for solutions that are rather dilute.
For water, Kf is 1.86 °C>m. Therefore, any aqueous solution that is 1 m in nonvolatile 
solute particles (such as 1 m C6H12O6 or 0.5 m NaCl) freezes at the temperature that is 
1.86 °C lower than the freezing point of pure water.
The freezing-point depression caused by solutes has useful applications: it is why 
antifreeze works in car cooling systems and why calcium chloride 1CaCl22 promotes the 
melting of ice on roads during winter.
