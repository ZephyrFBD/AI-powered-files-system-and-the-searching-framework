SCIENCE PRACTICE CHALLENGE QUESTIONS
44. Like Gram-positive bacteria, red blood cells have
carbohydrates on the cell surface. The A, B, A/B, and O
blood types are designations of the phenotypes expressed
by the alleles that code for these cell surface
carbohydrates.
A. Describe the relationship between regulation of
expression and the differences among the A, B, A/B, and
O types of blood cells.
B. Explain how the blood group phenotype does not
display non-Mendelian inheritance and the simplest
alternative model that explains this deviation.
Immune system T-cells recognize cell surface
carbohydrates of bacterial and red blood cells. That these
similarities have consequences for survival is indicated by
the observation that individuals with blood type O are
more susceptible to infection by Vibrio, the Gram-negative
bacteria that causes cholera, and individuals with type A/B
are more susceptible to infections from a broad range of E.
coli variants, all of which are also Gram-negative.
