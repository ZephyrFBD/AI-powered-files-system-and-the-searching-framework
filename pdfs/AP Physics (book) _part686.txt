is one of several great conservation laws in physics. Among the other quan-
tities found to be conserved are linear momentum, angular momentum, and
electric charge. We will eventually discuss all of these because the conservation laws
are among the most important ideas in science. In this Chapter we discuss linear
momentum and its conservation. The law of conservation of momentum is essen-
tially a reworking of Newton’s laws that gives us tremendous physical insight and
problem-solving power.
The law of conservation of momentum is particularly useful when dealing with
a system of two or more objects that interact with each other, such as in collisions
of ordinary objects or nuclear particles.
Our focus up to now has been mainly on the motion of a single object, often
thought of as a “particle” in the sense that we have ignored any rotation or internal
motion. In this Chapter we will deal with systems of two or more objects, and—toward
the end of the Chapter—the concept of ce
