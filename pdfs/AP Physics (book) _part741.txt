M is located at the geometric center of the object.
To locate the center of mass of a group of extended objects, we can use
Eqs. 7–9, where the m’s are the masses of these objects and the x’s, y’s, and z’s 
are the coordinates of the CM of each of the objects.

Linear Momentum
†There would be a difference between the CM and CG only in the unusual case of an object so large
that the acceleration due to gravity, g, was different at different parts of the object.

considered to act at the CG, causes
this object to rotate about the pivot
point; if the CG were on a vertical
line directly below the pivot, the
object would remain at rest.

7–9 CM for the Human Body
For a group of extended objects, each of whose CM is known, we can find the 
CM of the group using Eqs. 7–9a and b. As an example, we consider the human 
body. Table 7–1 indicates the CM and hinge points (joints) for the different compo
