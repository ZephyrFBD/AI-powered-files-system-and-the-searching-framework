a.
True. Because when the host cell experiences

b.
True. Because the host cell in both the
replication stage and during unfavorable
conditions stays in the lysogenic cycle as it is
more preferable over the lytic cycle.
c.
False. Because when the host cell experiences
unfavorable conditions, the prophage exits the
genome and enters the lytic cycle.
d.
False. Because when the host cell experiences
unfavorable conditions, the virus enters latency
