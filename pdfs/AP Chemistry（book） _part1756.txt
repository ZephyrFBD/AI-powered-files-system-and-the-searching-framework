What is the enthalpy change during the process in which 
100.0 g of water at 50.0 °C is cooled to ice at -30.0 °C? (Use 
the specific heats and enthalpies for phase changes given in 
Sample Exercise 11.3.)
and other people working with gases. Sometimes we want to liquefy a gas; other times we 
want to avoid liquefying it. It is useless to try to liquefy a gas by applying pressure if the 
gas is above its critical temperature. For example, O2 has a critical temperature of 154.4 K. 
It must be cooled below this temperature before it can be liquefied by pressure. In con-
trast, ammonia has a critical temperature of 405.6 K. Thus, it can be liquefied at room 
temperature (approximately 295 K) by applying sufficient pressure.
When the temperature exceeds the critical temperature and the pressure exceeds the 
critical pressure, the liquid and gas phases are indistinguishable from each other, and 
the substance is in a state called a supercritical fluid. A supercri
