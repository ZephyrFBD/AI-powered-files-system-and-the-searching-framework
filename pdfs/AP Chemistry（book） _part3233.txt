CHAPTER 20 Electrochemistry
Chemistry And life Heartbeats and Electrocardiography
The human heart is a marvel of efficiency and dependability. In a typ-
ical day, an adult’s heart pumps more than 7000 L of blood through 
the circulatory system, usually with no maintenance required 
beyond a sensible diet and lifestyle. We generally think of the heart 
as a mechanical device, a muscle that circulates blood via regularly 
spaced muscular contractions. However, more than two centuries 
ago, two pioneers in electricity, Luigi Galvani (1729–1787) and Ales-
sandro Volta (1745–1827), discovered that the contractions of the 
heart are controlled by electrical phenomena, as are nerve impulses 
throughout the body. The pulses of electricity that cause the heart to 
beat result from a remarkable combination of electrochemistry and 
the properties of semiperme
