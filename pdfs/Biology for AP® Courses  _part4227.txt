 them from desiccation (drying out) and wave damage. Another consequence of the
pounding waves is that few algae and plants establish themselves in the constantly moving rocks, sand, or mud.

The neritic zone (Figure 35.21) extends from the intertidal zone to depths of about 200 m (or 650 ft) at the edge of the
continental shelf. Since light can penetrate this depth, photosynthesis can occur in the neritic zone. The water here contains
silt and is well-oxygenated, low in pressure, and stable in temperature. Phytoplankton and floating Sargassum (a type of
free-floating marine seaweed) provide a habitat for some sea life found in the neritic zone. Zooplankton, protists, small
fishes, and shrimp are found in the neritic zone
