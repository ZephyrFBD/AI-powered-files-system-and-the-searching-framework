 incident projectile particles will
pass through the target without colliding. If 
is the rate at which the projectile
particles strike the target (number second), the rate at which collisions occur, R,
is
so
Thus, by measuring the collision rate, R, we can determine 
The cross section 
is an “effective” target area. It is a measure of the probability
of a collision or of a particular reaction occurring per target nucleus, independent
of the dimensions of the entire target. The concept of cross section is useful

interact via the strong nuclear force.
