motes the diffusion of fluid into the interstitial space. After the blood has passed through the capillary
beds to the venules, veins, and finally to the main venae cavae, the rate of flow increases again but is still much slower than
the initial rate in the aorta. Blood primarily moves in the veins by the rhythmic movement of smooth muscle in the vessel
wall and by the action of the skeletal muscle as the body moves. Because most veins must move blood against the pull of
gravity, blood is prevented from flowing backward in the veins by one-way valves. Because skeletal muscle contraction
aids in venous blood flow, it is important to get up and move frequently after long periods of sitting so that blood will not
pool in the extremities.
Blood flow through the capillary beds is regulated depending on the bodyâ€™s needs and is directed by nerve and hormone
signals. For example, after a large meal, most of the blood is diverted to the stomach by vasodilation of vessels of the
