Prokaryotes are useful in science because they carry extrachromosomal
DNA elements called plasmids. Plasmids are circular bits of DNA that can
be added or changed to allow for the addition or suppression of certain
functions based on the coding of inserted DNA sections.
5.1 Diﬀerentiate between prokaryotic and eukaryotic structures
The cell envelope usually consists of a cell wall that covers a plasma
membrane and may sometimes also include another protective layer
called the capsule. The envelope provides structure as well as a
protective filter for the cell. Most prokaryotes contain a cell wall that acts
as yet another protective barrier from the cell’s external environment.
Many prokaryotes have external projections known as flagella and pili.
Flagella (singular: flagellum) are long projections or appendages that
protrude from the cell body. The primary function of flagella is
locomotion, but they can also function as a sensory struct
