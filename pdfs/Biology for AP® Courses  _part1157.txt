ry molecules are negative regulators. Negative regulators halt the cell cycle.
Remember that in positive regulation, active molecules cause the cycle to progress.
The best understood negative regulatory molecules are retinoblastoma protein (Rb), p53, and p21. Retinoblastoma
proteins are a group of tumor-suppressor proteins common in many cells. The 53 and 21 designations refer to the functional
molecular masses of the proteins (p) in kilodaltons. Much of what is known about cell cycle regulation comes from research
conducted with cells that have lost regulatory control. All three of these regulatory proteins were discovered to be damaged
or non-functional in cells that had begun to replicate uncontrollably (became cancerous). In each case, the main cause of the
unchecked progress through the cell cycle was a faulty copy of the regulatory protein.
Rb, p53, and p21 act primarily at the G1 checkpoint. p53 is a multi-functional protein that has a major impact on the
commitment of a cell to
