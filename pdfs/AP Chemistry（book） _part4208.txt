red shading. Figure 8.13 The lengths of the bonds of the outer 
O atoms to the inner O atom are the same. Figure 8.14 Yes. The 
electron densities on the left and right parts of the molecule are the 
same, indicating that resonance has made the two O  ¬

equivalent to one another. Figure 8.15 The dashed bonds repre-
sent the delocalized electrons that result when the two resonance 
structures are averaged. Figure 8.16 It should be halfway between 
the values for single and double bonds, which we can estimate to be 
about 280 kJ/mol from the graph.
