any gene you like into the body through the ‘vaccine’. ‘You can
certainly give them a gene that would do them some harm if you
wanted.’ I was intrigued when he said that when used in the cancer
ﬁeld the technique could turn genes on and oﬀ. I explore this process
in The Answer and with diﬀerent genes having diﬀerent functions
you could create mayhem – physically and psychologically – if you
turned the wrong ones on and the right ones oﬀ. I read reports of an
experiment by researchers at the University of Washington’s school
of computer science and engineering in which they encoded DNA to
infect computers. The body is itself a biological computer and if
human DNA can inﬂict damage on a computer why can’t the
