nvolves many enzyme-catalyzed steps and intermediates. When studying
for the AP Biology exam, focus on where each process in cellular respiration occurs and what the inputs and outputs
are for each process. Figure 9.1 and Table 9.2 summarize the location, inputs, and outputs of glycolysis.

Oxidation of Pyruvate
The next step in cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria. The three-carbon pyruvate molecule must be
modified in order to enter the mitochondria. Pyruvate is oxidized (loses a hydrogen atom and its electrons), and the
electron carrier NAD+ is reduced (gains a hydrogen atom and its electrons) and becomes NADH. As this happens,
one of the carbons in the pyruvate molecule is released as carbon dioxide, leaving behind a two-carbon acetyl group.
Coenzyme A attaches to this two-carbon acetyl group. Coenzyme A will deliver the acetyl group to the
