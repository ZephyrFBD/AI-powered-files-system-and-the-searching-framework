on the left axis, precipitation is
shown on the right axis, and months of the year is shown on the x-
axis. Assuming that a major limiting factor for plant growth is
availability of water, choose the graph below that depicts the region

Which of the following statements accurately accounts for the shape
of the graph?
The rate of photosynthesis stops increasing because chlorophyll
molecules begin to decompose due to increased heat, not
increased light.
The rate of photosynthesis slows as chlorophyll molecules,
which are proteins, denature.
Photosynthesis ceases when protons are no longer released by
the photolysis of water.
The rate of photosynthesis increases until the light-harvesting
