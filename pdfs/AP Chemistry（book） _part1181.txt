ich ion 
is smaller? (b) Using Equation 7.1 and assuming that core 
electrons contribute 1.00 and valence electrons contribute 
nothing to the screening constant, S, calculate Zeff for these 
two ions. (c) Repeat this calculation using Slaterâ€™s rules to 
estimate the screening constant, S. (d) For isoelectronic ions, 
how are effective nuclear charge and ionic radius related?
 7.33  Consider S, Cl, and K and their most common ions. (a) List 
the atoms in order of increasing size. (b) List the ions in 
order of increasing size. (c) Explain any differences in the 
orders of the atomic and ionic sizes.
 7.34  Arrange each of the following sets of atoms and ions, in 
order of increasing size: (a) Se2-, Te2-, Se; (b) Co3+, Fe2+, Fe3+; 
 
(c) Ca, Ti4+, Sc3+; (d) Be2+, Na+, Ne.
 7.35  Provide a brief explanation for each of the following: (a) O2- 
is larger than O. (b) S2- is larger than O2-. (c) S2- is larger 
than K+. (d) K+ is larger than Ca2+.
