ecules, it gets absorbed. An electric field 
perpendicular to
the long molecules does not have this possibility of doing work and transferring
its energy, and so passes through freely. When we speak of the transmission axis
of a Polaroid, we mean the direction for which 
is passed, so a Polaroid axis is
perpendicular to the long molecules. [If we want to think of there being slits
between the parallel molecules in the sense of Fig. 24–39, then Fig. 24–39 would
apply for the 
field in the EM wave, not the 
field.]

CHAPTER 24
The Wave Nature of Light
If a beam of plane-polarized light strikes a Polaroid whose transmission axis
is at an angle 
to the incident polarization direction, the beam will emerge 
plane-polarized parallel to the Polaroid transmission axis, and the amplitude of E
will be reduced to 
Fig. 24–41. Thus, a Polaroid passes only that component
of polarization (the electric field vector,
) that is parallel to its transmission axis.
Because the i
