11. Three new species (A, B, and C) of fossilized crocodile are discovered. The characteristics of these species are
compared to those of the saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus porosus. The saltwater crocodile is found in
Southeast Asia and Australia, and adults range in length from 5.5 to 5.8 meters and have 66 teeth. Data
comparing the characteristics of the three fossilized crocodile species are shown in the table.
(a) Based on the data given, identify the fossil species that has the most in common with Crocodylus porosus.
(b) The number of teeth in a crocodile jaw correlates with increased predator efficiency. Identify the
crocodile(s) that would be less efficient predators than C. porosus.
(c) Evaluate the claim that species B shares a more recent common ancestor with C. porosus than do species
A or species C.
(d) Explain your reasoning for your response from part (c).
