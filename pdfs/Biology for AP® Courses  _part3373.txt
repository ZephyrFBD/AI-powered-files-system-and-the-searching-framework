Thyroid Gland
The thyroid gland is located in the neck, just below the larynx and in front of the trachea, as shown in Figure 28.16. It is a
butterfly-shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus. It has a dark red color due to its extensive vascular
system. When the thyroid swells due to dysfunction, it can be felt under the skin of the neck.
Figure 28.16 This illustration shows the location of the thyroid gland.
The thyroid gland is made up of many spherical thyroid follicles, which are lined with a simple cuboidal epithelium. These
follicles contain a viscous fluid, called colloid, which stores the glycoprotein thyroglobulin, the precursor to the thyroid
hormones. The follicles produce hormones that can be stored in the colloid or released into the surrounding capillary
network for transport to the rest of the body via the circulatory system.
