off produces a dead zone in the Chesapeake Bay by increasing oxygen concentration in the

Excess nitrogen from fertilizer increases microbial growth, depleting dissolved oxygen in water, thereby
killing the fauna of the ecosystem.
The Sulfur Cycle
Sulfur is an essential element for the macromolecules of living things. As a part of the amino acid cysteine, it is involved
in the formation of disulfide bonds within proteins, which help to determine their 3-D folding patterns, and hence their
functions. As shown in Figure 37.21, sulfur cycles between the oceans, land, and atmosphere. Atmospheric sulfur is found
in the form of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and enters the atmosphere in three ways: from the decomposition of organic molecules,
from volcanic activity and geothermal vents, and from the burning of fossil fuels by humans.
Figure 37.22 Sulfur dioxide from the atmosphere becomes available to terrestrial and marine ecosystems when it is
dissolved in precipitation as weak sulfuric
