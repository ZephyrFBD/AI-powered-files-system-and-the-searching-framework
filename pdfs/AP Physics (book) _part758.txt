1. A truck going 
has a head-on collision with a small
car going 
Which statement best describes the
situation?
(a) The truck has the greater change of momentum
because it has the greater mass.
(b) The car has the greater change of momentum because
it has the greater speed.
(c) Neither the car nor the truck changes its momentum in
the collision because momentum is conserved.
(d) They both have the same change in magnitude of
momentum because momentum is conserved.
(e) None of the above is necessarily true.
2. A small boat coasts at constant speed under a bridge.
A heavy sack of sand is dropped from the bridge onto the
boat. The speed of the boat 
(a) increases.
(b) decreases.
(c) does not change.
(d) Without knowing the mass of the boat and the sand,
we canâ€™t tell.
3. Two identical billiard balls traveling at the same speed have a
head-on collision and rebound. If the balls had twice the
mass, but maintained the same size and speed, how would
the rebound be different?
(a) A
