IST-1.J.3
Many traits are the product of multiple genes 
and/or physiological processes acting in 
combination; these traits therefore do not 
segregate in Mendelian patterns.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
IST-1
Heritable information provides for continuity of life.

ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES
§
§ Sex-linked genes reside 
on sex chromosomes.
§
§ In mammals and flies, 
females are XX and 
males are XY; as such, 
X-linked recessive traits 
are always expressed in 
males.
§
§ In certain species, the 
chromosomal basis 
of sex determination 
is not based on X 
and Y chromosomes 
(such as ZW in birds, 
haplodiploidy in bees).
