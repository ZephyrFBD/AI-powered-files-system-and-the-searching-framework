68. The roof over a 9.0-m
10.0-m room in a school has a
total mass of 13,600 kg. The roof is to be supported by 
vertical wooden “
” (actually about 
)
equally spaced along the 10.0-m sides. How many supports
are required on each side, and how far apart must they be?
Consider only compression, and assume a safety factor of 12.
69. A 25-kg object is being lifted by two people pulling on the
ends of a 1.15-mm-diameter nylon cord that goes over two
3.00-m-high poles 4.0 m apart, as shown in Fig. 9–86. How
high above the floor will the object be when the cord breaks?

trees by a light cord as in Fig. 9–51. A bear grabs the back-
pack and pulls vertically downward with a constant force,
so that each section of cord
