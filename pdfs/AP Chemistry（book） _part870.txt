nsider the following unbalanced oxidation-reduction 
 
reactions in aqueous solution:
Ag+1aq2 + Li1s2 ¡  Ag1s2 + Li+1aq2
 
 
Fe1s2 + Na+1aq2 ¡  Fe2 +1aq2 + Na1s2
K1s2 + H2O1l2 ¡  KOH1aq2 + H21g2
 
 (a) Balance each of the reactions. (b) By using data in 
Appendix C, calculate ∆H ° for each of the reactions. 
 
(c) Based on the values you obtain for ∆H°, which of the re-
actions would you expect to be thermodynamically favored? 
(d) Use the activity series to predict which of these reactions 
should occur.  
(Section 4.4) Are these results in accord 
with your conclusion in part (c) of this problem?
 5.122 Consider the following acid-neutralization reactions involv-
ing the strong base NaOH(aq):
