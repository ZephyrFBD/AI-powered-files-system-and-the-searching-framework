12.7 ∣ Covalent-Network Solids
Covalent-network solids consist of atoms held together in large networks by cova-
lent bonds. Because covalent bonds are much stronger than intermolecular forces, these 
solids are much harder and have higher melting points than molecular solids. Diamond 
and graphite, two allotropes of carbon, are two of the most familiar covalent-network 
solids. Other examples are silicon, germanium, quartz 1SiO22, silicon carbide (SiC), and 
boron nitride (BN). In all cases, the bonding between atoms is either completely covalent 
or more covalent than ionic.
In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded tetrahedrally to four other carbon atoms 
(Figure 12.29). The structure of diamond can be derived from the zinc blende structure 
(Figure
