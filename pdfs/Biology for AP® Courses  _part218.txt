Figure 2.25 Carbon can form five-and six membered rings. Single or double bonds may connect the carbons in the
ring, and nitrogen may be substituted for carbon.
Isomers
The three-dimensional placement of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to understanding their
chemistry. Molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement (structure) of their atoms and/
or chemical bonds are known as isomers. Structural isomers (like butane and isobutene shown in figurea) differ in
the placement of their covalent bonds: both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens (C4H10), but the different
arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties. For example, due to their
different chemical properties, butane is suited for use as a fuel for torches, whereas isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant
and a propellant in spray cans.
