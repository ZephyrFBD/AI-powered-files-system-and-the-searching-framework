EXERCISE F Suppose Fig. 7–9 shows the force on a golf ball vs. time during the time
interval when the ball hits a wall. How would the shape of this curve change if a softer
rubber ball with the same mass and speed hit the same wall?
FIGURE 7;11 Example 7–6.
Karate blow. Estimate the impulse and the
average force delivered by a karate blow that breaks a board (Fig. 7–11).
Assume the hand moves at roughly 
when it hits the board.
APPROACH We use the momentum-impulse relation, Eq. 7–4. The hand’s
speed changes from 
to zero over a distance of perhaps one cm (roughly
how much your hand and the board compress before your hand comes to a 
stop, and the board begins to give way). The hand’s mass should probably include
part of the arm, and we take it to be roughly
SOLUTION The impulse 
equals the change in momentum
We can obtain the for
