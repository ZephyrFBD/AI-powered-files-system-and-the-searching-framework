Question 5 
 
  The table below shows the amino acid sequence of the carboxyl-terminal segment of a conserved 
polypeptide from four different, but related, species. Each amino acid is represented by a three-letter 
abbreviation, and the amino acid residues in the polypeptide chains are numbered from the amino end 
to the carboxyl end. Empty cells indicate no amino ac
