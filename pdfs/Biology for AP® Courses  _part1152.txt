Down Syndrome is a genetic, developmental condition caused by nondisjunction of chromosome 21 during meiosis.
Explain how a problem with the spindle checkpoint can cause this to occur in the cell.
a.
Failure in spindle checkpoint results in the formation of one gamete cell with two extra chromosomes and
another gamete cell lacking chromosomes.
b.
Failure in spindle checkpoint yields the same number of chromosomes in each gamete cell.
c.
Failure in spindle checkpoint will form two gamete cells without any chromosomes.
d.
Failure in spindle checkpoint results in the formation of one gamete cell with an extra chromosome and
another gamete cell lacking a chromosome.
