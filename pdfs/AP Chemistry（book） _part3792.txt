complex. As soon as the solution is formed, and before 
any change in conductivity has occurred, a 25.00-mL 
portion of the solution is titrated with 0.0100 M AgNO3 
solution. What volume of AgNO3 solution do you expect 
to be required to precipitate the free Br-(aq)? (d) Based on 
the response you gave to part (b), what volume of AgNO3 
solution would be required to titrate a fresh 25.00-mL sam-
ple of 3Co(NH3)4Br24Br after all conductivity changes have 
occurred?
 23.98  The total concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in a sample of 
hard water was determined by titrating a 0.100-L sample of 
the water with a solution of EDTA4-. The EDTA4- chelates 
the two cations:
Mg2+ + 3EDTA44- ยก  3Mg(EDTA)42-
 Ca2+ + 3EDTA44- ยก  3Ca(EDTA)42-
It requires 31.5 mL of 0.0104 M 3EDTA44- solution to reach 
the end point in the titration. A second 0.100-L sample was 
then treated with sulfate ion to precipitate Ca2+ as calcium 
sulfate. The Mg2+ was then titrated with 18.7 mL of 0.0104 
M 3EDTA44-. Calculate
