This option is incorrect because the crosses of blue and white and blue and pink 
do fit expected phenotypic ratios. Vegetative propagation would not result in the 
ratios indicated by the data.
(D)
This option is correct. The student is asked to evaluate the data given. The 
crosses between blue / white and blue / pink show expected 3:1 ratios in the 
F1 generation. The appearance of a majority of blue flowers in the F1 cross 
between pink and white indicate that there is another gene product affecting 
the outcome.
