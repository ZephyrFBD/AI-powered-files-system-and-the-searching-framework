R-values for Building Materials
The insulating properties of building materials are often specified by R-values
(or “thermal resistance”), defined for a given thickness of material as:
The R-value of a given piece of material combines the thickness and the thermal
conductivity k in one number. Larger R means better insulation from heat or cold.
In the United States, R-values are given in British units as 
(for
example, R-19 means 
). Table 14–5 gives R-values for some
common building materials. R-values increase directly with material thickness:
for example, 2 inches of fiberglass is R-6, whereas 4 inches is R-12.
