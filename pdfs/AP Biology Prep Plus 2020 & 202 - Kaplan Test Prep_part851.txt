formed into other forms
of nitrogen, which can then be taken up by other organisms. Because
ammonia plays a role in the nitrogen cycle, (C) is correct. (A) is
incorrect because ammonia is not broken down in cellular respiration.
(B) is incorrect because organisms do not break down ammonia to
release heat. (D) is incorrect because ammonia is not a major source of
energy for producers.

According to the graphs, the inner shelf and mid shelf coral
populations were relatively stable with slight increases during the
period without disturbances. However, the outer shelf population had
a period of rapid growth followed by a drop aȇer disturbances. (A) is
thus correct. (B) is incorrect because the outer shelf does not exhibit a
logistic (S-shaped) growth curve since the population drops oﬀ rather
than plateauing. (B) also says that the inner and mid shelf lacked
disturbance, which is false based on the data. (C) and (D) are incorrect
because none of the figures sho
