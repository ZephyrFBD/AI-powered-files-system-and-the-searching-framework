he hybrid zone beyond the range of either parent. Exposed to
different selection pressures, the hybrids eventually diverge from both parent populations.

3. Adaptive radiation is the relatively rapid evolution of many species from a single ancestor. It occurs when the
ancestral species is introduced to an area where diverse geographic or ecological conditions are available for
colonization. Variants of the ancestral species diverge as populations specialize for each set of conditions.
The marsupials of Australia began with the colonization and subsequent adaptive radiation of a single ancestral
species. 
The 14 species of Darwinâ€™s finches on the Galapagos Islands evolved from a single ancestral South American
mainland species.
Adaptive radiations occurred after each of the five big mass extinctions. With up to 90% of species going extinct,
the periods following extinctions provided numerous ecological opportunities for species to colonize. Colonization
was followed by compet
