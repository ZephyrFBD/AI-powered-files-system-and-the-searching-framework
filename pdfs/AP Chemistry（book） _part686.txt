where k is a proportionality constant whose value is 8.99 * 109 J-m/C2.* Recall from 
Chapter 1 that the units used to measure energy are joules, where 1 J = 1 kg@m2/s2 . At the

binations of units such as J-m/C2 expressed with dots separating units instead of short dashes, 
 
J∙m/C2, or with dashes and dots totally absent, J m/C2.

atomic level, the charges Q1 and Q2 are typically on the order of magnitude of the charge 
of an electron 11.60 * 10-19 C2, while di
