2.20 The student is able to justify that positive feedback mechanisms amplify responses in
organisms.
Hormones have a wide range of effects and modulate many different body processes. The key regulatory processes that
will be examined here are those affecting the excretory system, the reproductive system, metabolism, blood calcium
concentrations, growth, and the stress response.
Hormonal Regulation of the Excretory System
Maintaining a proper water balance in the body is important to avoid dehydration or over-hydration (hyponatremia). The
water concentration of the body is monitored by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, w
