 from its normal relaxed state. Some proteins are known to be involved in
the supercoiling; other proteins and enzymes such as DNA gyrase help in maintaining the supercoiled structure.
Eukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule, employ a different type of packing strategy to fit
their DNA inside the nucleus (Figure 14.11). At the most basic level, DNA is wrapped around proteins known as histones
to form structures called nucleosomes. The histones are evolutionarily conserved proteins that are rich in basic amino acids
and form an octamer. The DNA (which is negatively charged because of the phosphate groups) is wrapped tightly around
the histone core. This nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a linker DNA. This is also known as the “beads
on a string” structure. This is further compacted into a 30 nm fiber, which is the diameter of the structure. At the metaphase
stage, the chromosomes are at their most compact, are approximately 700 nm in width
