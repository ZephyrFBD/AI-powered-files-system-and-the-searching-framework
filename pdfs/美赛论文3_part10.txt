would like to solve is about keeping the temperature even throughout the whole
bathtub and as close as possible to the initial temperature without wasting too much
water. Hence, there are three key factors that have a deciding impact on the strategy.
The first one is the ‘even time’, which means the time from adding the hot water into
the bathtub to feeling that the temperature of water becomes even. The second one is
the ‘suffering degree’, which means the degree a person suffers when the temperature
is lower than its initial temperature. The last one is undoubtedly the ‘wasting water’,
which means the volume of the wasting water.
Above all, we use quantification analysis to combine three key factors to
evaluate the efficiency of the strategy. Moreover, we use controlling variables method
and sensitivity analysis to describe and analyze the influences other factors have on
the strategy, so we can give some conclusions and advices about the strategy and
make some changes
