of the angle. The values of sine, cosine, and
tangent for different angles can be found using a scientific calculator, or from the
Table in Appendix A.
A useful trigonometric identity is
(3;2)
which follows from the Pythagorean theorem (
in Fig. 3–11). That is:
(See Appendix A and inside the rear cover for other details on trigonometric
functions and identities.)
The use of trigonometric functions for finding the components of a vector is
illustrated in Fig. 3–12, where a vector and its two components are thought of as
making up a right triangle. We then see that the sine, cosine, and tangent are as
given in Fig. 3–12, where is the angle 
makes with the 
axis. If we multiply
the definition of
by V on both sides, we get
(3;3a)
Similarly, from the definition of 
we obtain
(3;3b)
Note that if is not the angle the vector makes with the positive x axis, Eqs. 3–3
are not valid.
