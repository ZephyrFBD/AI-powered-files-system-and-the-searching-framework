pan.
RESPONSE Experience may tell you that the water warms up—perhaps by as
much as 10 or 20 degrees. The water doesn’t come close to boiling. The water’s
temperature increase is a lot less than the frying pan’s temperature decrease.
Why? Because the mass of water is roughly equal to that of the pan, and iron
has a specific heat nearly 10 times smaller than that of water (Table 14–1). As
heat leaves the frying pan and enters the water, the iron pan’s temperature
change will be about 10 times greater than that of the water. If, instead, you let a few
drops of water fall onto the hot pan, that very small mass of water will sizzle and boil
away (the pan’s mass may be hundreds of times larger than that of the water drops).
