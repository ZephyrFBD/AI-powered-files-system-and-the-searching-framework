produced. As the actin is pulled toward the M line, the sarcomere shortens and the muscle contracts.
When the myosin head is “cocked,” it contains energy and is in a high-energy configuration. This energy is expended as the
myosin head moves through the power stroke; at the end of the power stroke, the myosin head is in a low-energy position.
After the power stroke, ADP is released; however, the cross-bridge formed is still in place, and actin and myosin are bound
together. ATP can then attach to myosin, which allows the cross-bridge cycle to start again and further muscle contraction
can occur (Figure 29.37).
Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/contract_muscle) explaining how a muscle contraction is signaled.
Why can’t actin and myosin interact in the absence of calcium?
a.
Actin binding sites are covered by acetylcholine to which the troponin complex is attached. This complex is
