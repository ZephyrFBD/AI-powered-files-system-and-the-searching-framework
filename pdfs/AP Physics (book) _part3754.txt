But just as quickly, particles and antiparticles would annihilate: for example
So the processes of creation and annihilation of nucleons were in equilibrium.
The numbers of nucleons and antinucleons were high—roughly as many as there
were electrons, positrons, or photons. But as the universe expanded and cooled,
and the average kinetic energy of particles dropped below about 1 GeV, which is
the minimum energy needed in a typical collision to create nucleons and anti-
nucleons (about 940 MeV each), the process of nucleon creation could not continue.
