ip two organisms share, the more DNA they have in common, just like people and their families. People’s DNA
is likely to be more like their father or mother’s DNA than their cousin or grandparent’s DNA. Organisms of the same
species have the highest level of DNA alignment and therefore share characteristics and behaviors that lead to successful
reproduction.
Species’ appearance can be misleading in suggesting an ability or inability to mate. For example, even though domestic
dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) display phenotypic differences, such as size, build, and coat, most dogs can interbreed and
produce viable puppies that can mature and sexually reproduce (Figure 18.10).
