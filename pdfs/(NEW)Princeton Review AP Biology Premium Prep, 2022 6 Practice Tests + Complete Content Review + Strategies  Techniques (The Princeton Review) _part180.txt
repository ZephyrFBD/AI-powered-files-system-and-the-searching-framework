 compartmentalization is an
important part of the organization of unicellular and multicellular organisms.
The second reason we canâ€™t just be giant cells is the surface area-to-volume ratio. There is always lots of exchange
going on between the inside of things and the outside. This ratio must be kept large so that there is plenty of space to
do these exchanges. Some parts of living things are special because they have many folds, which increase the
surface area. Generally, smaller cells have a higher surface area-to-volume ratio; this allows them to more efficiently
exchange materials with their surroundings. As cells increase in volume, the surface area-to-volume ratio decreases,
and the exchange of materials becomes less efficient. The surface area-to-volume ratio concept can also be applied
to organisms. As organisms increase in size, their ratio will decrease and this can affect properties of the organism,
such as heat-exchange with their surroundings. Small organisms lose heat at
