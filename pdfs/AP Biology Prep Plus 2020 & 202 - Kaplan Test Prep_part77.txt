Living organisms must have a boundary, such as a membrane, that
defines the limits of the organism. There must have been a stepwise
pathway, from nonliving things to the complex organisms of today,
that involved simpler molecules performing the functions of more
complex ones. One such function is the formation of a barrier by fatty
acids, making (D) correct. Neither fatty acids nor phospholipids are
capable of catalyzing reactions. Therefore, (A) is incorrect. (B) reverses
the likely evolutionary sequence. Fatty acids were likely to be major
components of early membranes and were replaced by phospholipids
later. (C) is incorrect because fatty acids and phospholipids are not
capable of storing genetic information.

Living systems depend on properties of water that result from its
polarity and hydrogen bonding, such as its specific heat and heat of
vaporization. Due to its high specific heat, water is able to absorb a
large amount of solar heat while undergoin
