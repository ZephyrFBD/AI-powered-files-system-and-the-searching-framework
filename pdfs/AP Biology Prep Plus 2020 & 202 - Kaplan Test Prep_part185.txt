t of the cell. As
a result, the diameter of the cell would decrease, (D). There is no
reason to believe that the proteins would dissociate from the
membrane, so (A) is incorrect. Since the diameter of the cell should
decrease, the diameter wouldn’t stay the same, (B), or increase, (C).

Simple diﬀusion refers to the process by which a substance passes
through a membrane without the aid of an intermediary, such as an
integral membrane protein. Since leak channels are a type of integral
membrane protein, statement I cannot be true, eliminating (A) and (C).
Facilitated diﬀusion is the process of spontaneous transport of
molecules across a membrane via specific membrane-spanning
integral proteins. When acetylcholine binds to a nicotinic receptor, it
opens a ligand-gated ion channel that allows sodium, calcium, and
potassium to flow through it along their respective gradients. As a
result, this is a clear example of facilitated diﬀusion and II is true. The
sodium
