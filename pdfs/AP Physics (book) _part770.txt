n, determine the speed
and direction of each ball after the collision.
28. (II) Two billiard balls of equal mass undergo a perfectly
elastic head-on collision. If one ball’s initial speed was
and the other’s was 
in the opposite
direction, what will be their speeds and directions after the
collision?
29. (II) A 0.280-kg croquet ball makes an elastic head-on 
collision with a second ball initially at rest. The second 
ball moves off with half the original speed of the first ball.
(a) What is the mass of the second ball? (b) What fraction
of the original kinetic energy 
gets transferred 
to the second ball?
30. (II) A ball of mass m makes a head-on elastic collision with
a second ball (at rest) and rebounds with a speed equal 
to 0.450 its original speed. What is the mass of the 
second ball?
