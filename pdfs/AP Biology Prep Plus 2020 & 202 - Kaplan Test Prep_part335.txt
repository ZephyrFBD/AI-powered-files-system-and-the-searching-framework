The question stem indicates that a higher concentration of
acetylcholine (resulting from the administration of a cholinesterase
inhibitor) is able to reverse the eﬀects of the poison. This suggests that
tubocurarine and acetylcholine compete for the same site on the ion-
gated channel. (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because
acetylcholine must be released for a cholinesterase inhibitor (a
compound that inhibits cholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down
existing acetylcholine) to be capable of increasing acetylcholine
concentration. (C) is incorrect because increased acetylcholine could
reverse the eﬀects of tubocurarine, which would not happen if the
tubocurarine simply blocked the Na+ influx. (D) is incorrect because
the tubocurarine interferes with the eﬀects of acetylcholine, not with
the actual contraction mechanism of the muscle.
