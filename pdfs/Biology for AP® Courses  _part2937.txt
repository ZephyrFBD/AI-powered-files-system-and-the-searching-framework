absorbed into blood stream. The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle.
The ileum ends and the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve. The vermiform, “worm-like,” appendix is located at the
ileocecal valve. The appendix of humans secretes no enzymes and has an insignificant role in immunity.

jejunum (segment of the small intestine). The image shows the apical end of an absorptive cell with some of the
densely packed microvilli that make up the striated border. Each microvillus is approximately 1 μm long by 0.1 μm
in diameter and contains a core of actin microfilame
