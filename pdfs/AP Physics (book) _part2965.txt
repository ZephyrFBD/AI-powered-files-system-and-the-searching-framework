1. (I) A spaceship passes you at a speed of 0.850c. You measure
its length to be 44.2 m. How long would it be when at rest?
2. (I) A certain type of elementary particle travels at a speed
of 
At this speed, the average lifetime is
measured to be 
What is the particle’s lifetime

3. (II) You travel to a star 135 light-years from Earth at a speed
of 
What do you measure this distance to be?
4. (II) What is the speed of a pion if its average lifetime is
measured to be

5. (II) In an Earth reference frame, a star is 49 light-years
away. How fast would you have to travel so that to you the
distance would be only
