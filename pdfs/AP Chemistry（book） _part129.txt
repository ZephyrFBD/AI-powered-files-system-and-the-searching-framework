 of its source. This ratio is con-
stant because every water molecule has the same number of hydrogen and oxygen 
atoms. While the mass percentages make it seem that water is mostly oxygen, there 
are actually two hydrogen atoms and only one oxygen atom per molecule. The expla-
nation for this apparent discrepancy comes from the fact that hydrogen atoms are 
much lighter than oxygen atoms. This macroscopic composition corresponds to the 
molecular composition, which consists of two hydrogen atoms combined with one 
oxygen atom:
Oxygen atom
(written O)
Hydrogen atom
(written H)
Water molecule
(written H2O)

CHAPTER 1 Introduction: Matter, Energy, and Measurement
As seen in Table 1.2, the properties of water bear no resemblance to the properties 
of its component elements. Hydrogen, oxygen, and water are each a unique substance, a 
consequence of the uniqueness of their respective molecules.
The observation that the elemental composition of a compound is always the same is 
known as t
