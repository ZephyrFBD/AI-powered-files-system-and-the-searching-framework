 ions, 
move across the membrane through embedded 
channel and transport proteins.
ENE-2.C.5
Polar uncharged molecules, including H2O, 
pass through the membrane in small amounts.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
ENE-2
Cells have membranes that allow them to establish and maintain internal 
environments that are different from their external environments.
TOPIC 2.5
Membrane Permeability
ENE-2.D
Describe the role of the 
cell wall in maintaining cell 
structure and function.
ENE-2.D.1
Cell walls provide a structural boundary, as well 
as a permeability barrier for some substances 
to the internal environments.
ENE-2.D.2
Cell walls of plants, prokaryotes, and fungi are 
composed of complex carbohydrates.
