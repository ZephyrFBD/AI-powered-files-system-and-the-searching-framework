If you are the object 
in Fig. 23–16, situated between F and C, and are
trying to see yourself in the mirror, you would see a blur; but the person whose
eye is shown in Fig. 23–16 could see you clearly. If you are to the left of C in
Fig. 23–16, where 
, you can see yourself clearly, but upside down. Why?
Because then the rays arriving from the image will be diverging at your position
(Fig. 23–18), and your eye can then focus them. You can also see yourself clearly,
and right side up, if you are closer to the mirror than its focal point
as
we saw in Example 23–6, Fig. 23–17.
