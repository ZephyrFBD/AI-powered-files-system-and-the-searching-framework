 phenomenon, with many evolutionists postulating a major role for this process in evolution,
thus complicating the simple tree model. Genes have been shown to be passed between species which are only distantly
related using standard phylogeny, thus adding a layer of complexity to the understanding of phylogenetic relationships.
The various ways that HGT occurs in prokaryotes is important to understanding phylogenies. Although at present HGT
is not viewed as important to eukaryotic evolution, HGT does occur in this domain as well. Finally, as an example of the
ultimate gene transfer, theories of genome fusion between symbiotic or endosymbiotic organisms have been proposed to
explain an event of great importanceâ€”the evolution of the first eukaryotic cell, without which humans could not have come
into existence.
Horizontal Gene Transfer
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the introduction of genetic material from one species to another species by mechanisms
other than the vertical transmiss
