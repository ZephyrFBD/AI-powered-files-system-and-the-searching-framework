Another result of population growth is the endangerment of the natural environment. Many countries have attempted to
reduce the human impact on climate change by reducing their emission of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. However,
these treaties have not been ratified by every country, and many underdeveloped countries trying to improve their economic
condition may be less likely to agree with such provisions if it means slower economic development. Furthermore, the
