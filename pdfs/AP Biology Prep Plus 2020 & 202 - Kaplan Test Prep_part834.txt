Populations with infinite resources increase exponentially in a
J-shaped curve. Usually, the environment has a carrying
capacity, the maximum number of individuals it will support.
Factors aﬀecting population size can be density-dependent
(overcrowding) or density-independent (a storm wipes out part
of a population).

Species that are r-selected have many oﬀspring and provide
almost no parental care (fish, insects). They succeed best in
new habitats with many resources. K-selected species have few
oﬀspring and care for them for an extended period (elephants,
humans). Those species do best in stable environments near
carrying capacity.

A biome is a climatic zone with associated animals and
vegetation (tundra, desert, etc.). An ecosystem comprises a
community of living organisms and its habitat. Diﬀerent
populations of organisms make up the community. Each
