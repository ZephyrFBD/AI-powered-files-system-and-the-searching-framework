ntum of any particle of mass m is given by
Since 
for a photon, the denominator is zero. To
avoid having an infinite momentum, we conclude that the photon’s mass must be
zero:
This makes sense too because a photon can never be at rest (it
always moves at the speed of light). A photon’s kinetic energy is its total energy:
[photon]
The momentum of a photon can be obtained from the relativistic formula
(Eq. 26–9)
where we set
so
or
[photon]
Since
for a photon, its momentum is related to its wavelength by
(27;6)
Photon momentum and force. Suppose the
photons emitted per second from the 100-W lightbulb in Example 27–4 were
all focused onto a piece of black paper and absorbed. (a) Calculate the momentum
of one photon and (b) estimate the force all these photons could exert on the
paper.
APPROACH Each photon’s momentum is obtained from Eq. 27–6,
Next, each absorbed photon’s momentum changes from
to zero. We
use Newton’s second law,
to get the force. Let
SOLUTION (a) Each photon has a momentum
