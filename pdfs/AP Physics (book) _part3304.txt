energy levels
of the outer electrons are altered because they now interact
with each other. Additional energy levels also become possible
because the atoms can vibrate with respect to each other, and
the molecule as a whole can rotate. The energy levels for both
vibrational and rotational motion are quantized, and are very
close together (typically,
to 
apart). Each
atomic energy level thus becomes a set of closely spaced levels
corresponding to the vibrational and rotational motions. Tran-
sitions from one level to another appear as many very closely
spaced lines. The resulting spectra are called band spectra.
The quantized rotational energy levels are given by
(29;1)
where I is the moment of inertia of the molecule.
The energy levels for vibrational motion are given by
(29;3)
where f is the classical natural frequency of vibration for the
molecule. Transitions between energy levels are subject to the
selection rules

Some solids are bound together by covalent and ionic bonds,
