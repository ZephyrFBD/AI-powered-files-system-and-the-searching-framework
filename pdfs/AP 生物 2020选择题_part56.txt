lled for by the question, a diagram alone 
will not receive credit. Write clearly and legibly. Begin each answer on a new page. Do not 
skip lines. Cross out any errors you make; crossed-out work will not be scored. 
Manage your time carefully. You may proceed freely from one question to the next. You 
may review your responses if you finish before the end of the exam is announced.

If A and B are mutually exclusive, then: 
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) 
If A and B are independent, then: 
P(A and B) = P(A)  P(B)
