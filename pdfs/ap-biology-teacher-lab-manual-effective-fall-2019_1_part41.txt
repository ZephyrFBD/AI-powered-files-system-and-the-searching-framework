climb up in their chambers or vials against gravity. Movement toward a substance is a 
positive taxis. Consistent movement or orientation away from a substance is a negative 
taxis. In most cases, the experiments done in the choice chamber will be chemotactic 
experiments, as indicated by the number of flies that collect on one end of the chamber 
or another in response to a chemical stimulus. At some point, students may wish 
to investigate if the chemotactic response is greater than a geotactic or phototactic

FRUIT FLY BEHAVIOR
What environmental factors trigger a fruit fly 
response?
