ertiary structures of the
proteins to be disrupted, thus denaturing the enzyme.
24. (A) is correct. The branch that is farthest from the other branches is the snake, because the snake is put
into the analysis as an outlier. An outlier is an organism that is known to have a less recent common
ancestor than any of the others and is used as a control to be sure that the analysis makes sense. If the
outlier were to appear to share a more recent common ancestor with the other organisms, then it is
known that the method is faulty. Because there are the fewest differences between the raccoon and red
panda, and between the brown bear and giant panda, it is known that each pair belongs together on a
branch, showing that they share a recent common ancestor. The raccoon and red panda should be
closer to the snake, since they have slightly fewer differences than the brown bear and the giant panda.
25. (B) is correct. The amino acid differences are lowest between organisms that share the most recen
