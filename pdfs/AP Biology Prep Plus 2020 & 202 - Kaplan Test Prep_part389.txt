tion experiment, transgenic mice (those possessing a
particular genetic mutation) were compared to wild type (normal)
mice. The ADP levels in the transgenic mice were found to be
higher than those in the wild type. Which of the following is the
most plausible explanation for this finding?
The rate of oxygen consumption in mitochondria was higher
in transgenic mice.
(A)
The transgenic mice have impaired mitochondria, reducing
their ability to convert ADP to ATP.
(B)
The transgenic mice are unable to utilize ATP in the
cytoplasm for metabolism.
(C)
The rate of carbon dioxide consumption in cells was lower in
transgenic mice.
(D)
Photosynthesis
Cellular metabolism is the sum total of all chemical reactions that take
place in a cell. These reactions can be generally categorized as either
anabolic or catabolic. Anabolic processes are energy-requiring, involving
the biosynthesis of complex organic compounds from simpler molecules.
Catabolic processes release energy as they break down complex
