Satellite Motion
Artificial satellites circling the Earth are now commonplace (Fig. 5–21). A satellite
is put into orbit by accelerating it to a sufficiently high tangential speed with the use
of rockets, as shown in Fig. 5–22. If the speed is too high, the spacecraft will not be
confined by the Earth’s gravity and will escape, never to return. If the speed is too
low, it will return to Earth. Satellites are typically put into circular (or nearly circu-
lar) orbits, because such orbits require the least takeoff speed.

It is sometimes asked: “What keeps a satellite up?” The answer is: its high
speed. If a satellite in orbit stopped moving, it would fall directly to Earth. But at
the very high speed a satellite has, it would quickly fly out into space (Fig. 5–23)
if it weren’t for the gravitational fo
