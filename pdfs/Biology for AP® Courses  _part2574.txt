 the growth of the flasks
after some time?
a.
The growth in flask A will continue to exceed
that of flask B.
b.
The growth in flask B will exceed continue to
exceed that of flask A.
c.
Eventually, the difference in the growth in each
flask will lessen.
d.
Eventually, will be little to no growth in each
flask.
72. In a hypothetical research situation, scientists discover
bacterial endospores in silt at the bottom of a marsh that
has been contaminated with a pollutant for 25 years. The
silt of the marsh was deposited in annual layers. The age
of the endospores can be estimated, then, by identifying
the layer of silt in which the endospores are found. In flask
A, researchers place 20-year-old endospores along with
growth medium and the pollutant. In flask B, researchers
place 100-year-old endospores along with growth medium
and the pollutant. Suppose the researchers observe the
flasks for a while, continuing to replenish growth medium
and pollutant as necessary. If the difference in the g
