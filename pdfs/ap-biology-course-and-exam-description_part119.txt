is 
established across the internal membrane.
ENE-1.J.4
The formation of the proton gradient is linked 
to the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic 
phosphate via ATP synthase.
ENE-1.J.5
The energy captured in the light reactions 
and transferred to ATP and NADPH powers 
the production of carbohydrates from carbon 
dioxide in the Calvin cycle, which occurs in the 
stroma of the chloroplast.

TOPIC 3.6
Cellular Respiration
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-1.K.1
Fermentation and cellular respiration use 
energy from biological macromolecules to 
produce ATP. Respiration and fermentation are 
characteristic of all forms of life.
ENE-1.K.2
Cellular respiration in eukaryotes involves 
a series of coordinated enzyme-catalyzed 
reactions that capture energy from biological 
macromolecules.
ENE-1.K.3
The
