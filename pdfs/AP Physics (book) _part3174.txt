28–10 Fluorescence and Phosphorescence
When an atom is excited from one energy state to a higher one by the absorption
of a photon, it may return to the lower level in a series of two (or more) 
transitions if there is at least one energy level in between (Fig. 28–14). The 
photons emitted will consequently have lower energy and frequency than the
absorbed photon. When the absorbed photon is in the UV and the emitted photons
are in the visible region of the spectrum, this phenomenon is called fluorescence
(Fig. 28–15).
The wavelength for which fluorescence will occur depends on the energy levels
of the particular atoms. Because the frequencies are different for different sub-
stances, and because many substances fluoresce readily, fluorescence is a powerful
tool for identification of compounds. It is also used for assaying—determining
how much of a su
