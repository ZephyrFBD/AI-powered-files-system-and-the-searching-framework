ctivated IRS-1 in individuals 
with type 2 diabetes indicates that no 
functional insulin receptor protein is 
produced in the muscle cells of those 
individuals. 
49. 
 Based on the experimental results, which of the 
following describes the most likely defect in 
muscle cells of patients with type 2 diabetes? 
(A) Insulin receptor proteins do not reach the cell 
surface. 
(B) Insulin does not activate its receptor. 
(C) IRS-1 activation is reduced at high insulin 
 
concentrations. 
(D) GLUT4 blocks glucose from entering cells. 
50. 
 Based on the information presented, which of  
the following genetic changes in an individual 
without diabetes is most likely to result in a 
disrupted cellular response to insulin signaling 
similar to that of an individual with type 2 
diabetes? 
(A) A deletion in the gene encoding the insulin 
receptor that removes only the cytoplasmic 
domain of the protein 
(B) Duplication of the gene encoding a PI-3 
kinase that results in synthesis of a muscle-
