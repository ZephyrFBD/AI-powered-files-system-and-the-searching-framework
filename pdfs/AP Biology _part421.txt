at carry out aerobic cell
respiration, they all contain the polypeptide cytochrome c. A comparison
of the amino acid sequence of cytochrome c among different organisms
shows which organisms are most closely related. The cytochrome c in
human cells is almost identical to that of our closest relatives, the
chimpanzee and gorilla, but differs from that of a pig.
6. Biogeography
According to the theory of plate tectonics, continents and oceans rest on
giant plates of Earthâ€™s crust that float on top of the hot mantle. Convection
currents in the mantle are responsible for the slow, continuous movement
of the plates known as continental drift. For example, the North
American plate drifts northwestward while it pulls away from the Eurasian
plate at a rate of about 2 cm per year. Continental drift causes mountains to
form as plates collide. About 45 million years ago, the Indian plate
collided with and sank beneath (subducted) the Eurasian plate, forcing it
upward and forming the Himalayan Moun
