r old friend, ATP. However, as you probably already know, the actual
picture of what really happens is far more complicated.
Generally speaking, we can break cellular respiration down into two different approaches: aerobic respiration and
anaerobic respiration. If ATP is made in the presence of oxygen, we call it aerobic respiration. If oxygen isn’t
present, we call it anaerobic respiration. Let’s jump right in with aerobic respiration.
Introduction to Aerobic Respiration
Aerobic respiration consists of four stages containing a series of coupled reactions that establish an electrochemical
gradient across membranes:
1. glycolysis
2. formation of acetyl-CoA
3. the Krebs (citric acid) cycle
4. oxidative phosphorylation (the electron transport chain + chemiosmosis)
In the first three stages, glucose is broken down and energy molecules are made. Some of these are ATP, and others
are special electron carriers called NADH and FADH2. In the fourth stage, these electron carriers unload their
