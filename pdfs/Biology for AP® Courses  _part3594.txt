PCO2 = (760 mm Hg) (0.0004) = 0.3 mm Hg.
At high altitudes, Patm decreases but concentration does not change; the partial pressure decrease is due to the reduction in
Patm.
When the air mixture reaches the lung, it has been humidified. The pressure of the water vapor in the lung does not change
the pressure of the air, but it must be included in the partial pressure equation. For this calculation, the water pressure (47
mm Hg) is subtracted from the atmospheric pressure:
760 mm Hg −47 mm Hg = 713 mm Hg
and the partial pressure of oxygen is:
(760 mm Hg −47 mm Hg)×0.21 = 150 mm Hg.
These pressures determine the gas exchange, or the flow of gas, in the system. Oxygen and carbon dioxide will flow
according to their pressure gradient from high to low. Therefore, understanding the partial pressure of each gas will aid in
understanding how gases move in the respiratory system.
Gas Exchange across the Alveoli
In the body, oxygen is used by cells of the body’s tissues and carbon dioxide is p
