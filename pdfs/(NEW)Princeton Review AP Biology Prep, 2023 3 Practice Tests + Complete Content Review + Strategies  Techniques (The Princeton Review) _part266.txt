s a common strategy to conserve energy.
If plenty of X is made, then the pathway to make X can be turned off. Sometimes, a very distant end product will
turn off a process occurring several steps back. For example, ATP turns off the beginning stages of glycolysis,
although ATP is not made until much later in cellular respiration. There are several other types of second
messengers, such as cyclic GMP, calcium ions, and inositol triphosphate.
A positive feedback pathway also involves an end product playing a role, but instead of inhibiting the pathway, it
further stimulates it. For example, once X is made, it tells the pathway to make even more X. This is less common,
but it occurs during fruit ripening and labor and delivery, which ramps up and up as it proceeds.
You won’t need to remember this specific example, but if it helps to better
visualize the positive feedback pathway, consider this. When a baby pushes
their head against the mother’s womb, the womb’s stretching causes a
hormone
