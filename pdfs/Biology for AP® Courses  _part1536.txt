You isolate a DNA strand in which the joining together of Okazaki fragments is impaired and suspect that a mutation
has occurred in an enzyme found at the replication fork. Which enzyme is most likely mutated?
14.5 | DNA Replication in Eukaryotes
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are the similarities and differences between DNA replication in eukaryotes and prokaryotes?
•
What is the role of telomerase in DNA replication?
Connection for AP® Courses
Concepts and examples described in this section are not in scope for AP. However, the roles of telomeres and telomerase in
aging and cancer are informative and build on your knowledge of DNA replication in prokaryotes.
Eukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger in size than prokaryotic genomes. The human genome has three
billion base pairs per haploid set of chromosomes, and 6 billion base pairs are replicated during the S phase of the cell
cycle. There are multiple origins of replication on the
