the ¬COOH group contributes to the solubility 
of the hemoglobin molecule in water. In the hemoglobin molecules 
of sickle-cell anemia patients, the ¬CH2CH2COOH chain is absent 
and in its place is the nonpolar (hydrophobic) ¬ CH1CH322 group:
CH3

This change leads to the aggregation of the defective form of he-
moglobin into particles too large to remain suspended in biological 
ﬂuids. It also causes the cells to distort into the sickle shape shown in 
Figure 13.29. The sickled cells tend to clog capillaries, causing severe 
pain, weakness, and the gradual deterioration of vital organs. The dis-
ease is hereditary, and if both parents carry the defective genes, it is 
likely that their children will possess only abnormal hemoglobin.
You might wonder how it is that a life-threatening disease such 
as sickle-cell anemia has persisted in humans through evolutionary 
time. The answer in part is that people with the gene are far less sus-
ceptible to malaria. Thus,
