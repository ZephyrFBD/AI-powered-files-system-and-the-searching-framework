(d) Explain how these experimental results relate to the structure of DNA.

13. Genomes with a higher GC content are more likely to resist denaturation. A plant biologist hypothesized that
plants with a higher GC content in their genomes are more likely to be found in colder climates. Four species of
plants were examined for the percentage of GC content in their genomes. Brachypodium pinnatum and
Dioscorea caucasica are native to areas with cold winters. Juncus inflexus and Carex acutiformis are native to
areas with warmer winters. DNA was examined from 50 plants of each species. Results are shown in the table.

(a) Using what you know about DNA structure, explain why genomes with a higher GC content might be
more stable than genomes
