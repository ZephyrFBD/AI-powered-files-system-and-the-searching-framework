1. Place the onion root tip in 1 M HCl for 4 minutes. 
2. Transfer the tip to Carnoy’s fixative for 4 minutes. 
3. Remove the slide from Coplin jar containing 70% ethanol, dry with a scientific  
cleaning wipe, and label it.  
4. Place the tip on the slide and cut off the distal 2 mm portion of the tip; discard the  
remainder of the tip.  
5. Cover the root tip piece with carbol-fuschin stain for 2 minutes. 
6. Blot off excess stain and cover the tip with 1–2 drops of H2O. 
7. Gently separate the root tip apart with dissecting probes or needles. Place the cover 
slip over the root tip and cover the cover slip with a scientific cleaning wipe. 
8. Firmly press down on the cover slip with the eraser end of a pencil. Do not twist the 
slide, and be careful not to break the cover slip. 
Counting Cells and Analyzing Data 
1. Observe the cells at high magnification (400–500 X). 
2. Look for well-stained, distinct cells. 
3. Within the field of
