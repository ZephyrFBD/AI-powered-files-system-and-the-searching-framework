 (Section 14.6)
The use of radioisotopes is possible because all isotopes of an element have essen-
tially identical chemical properties. When a small quantity of a radioisotope is mixed 
with the naturally occurring stable isotopes of the same element, all the isotopes go 
through the same reactions together. The element’s path is revealed by the radioactiv-
ity of the radioisotope. Because the radioisotope can be used to trace the path of the ele-
ment, it is called a radiotracer.

Why are the energies associated with nuclear reactions so large, in many cases orders of 
magnitude larg
