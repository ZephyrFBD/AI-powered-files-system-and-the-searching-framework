from lowest lattice energy to the highest: MgS, KI, GaN, LiBr.
 8.25 Consider the ionic compounds KF, NaCl, NaBr, and LiCl. 
 
(a) Use ionic radii (Figure 7.8) to estimate the cationâ€“anion 
distance for each compound. (b) Based on your answer to 
part (a), arrange these four compounds in order of decreasing 
lattice energy. (c) Check your predictions in part (b) with the 
experimental values of lattice energy from Table 8.1. Are the 
predictions from ionic radii correct?
 8.26 Which of the following trends in lattice energy is due 
to differences in ionic radii? (a) NaCl 7 RbBr 7 CsBr,  
(b) BaO 7 KF, (c) SrO 7 SrCl2.
 8.27 Energy is required to remove two electrons from Ca to form 
Ca2+, and energy is required to add two electrons to O to 
form O2 -. Yet CaO is stable relative to the free elements. 
Which statement is the best explanation? (a) The lattice 
energy of CaO is large enough to overcome these processes. 
(b) CaO is a covalent compound, and these processes are 
 
irrelevant
