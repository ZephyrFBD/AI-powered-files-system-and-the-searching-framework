 to that of
other self-replicating molecules, likely evolving alongside the cells they rely on as hosts; studies of some plant pathogens
support this hypothesis.
As technology advances, scientists may develop and refine further hypotheses to explain the origin of viruses. The emerging
field called virus molecular systematics attempts to do just that through comparisons of sequenced genetic material. These

researchers hope to one day better understand the origin of viruses, a discovery that could lead to advances in the treatments
for the ailments they produce.
Viral Morphology
Viruses are acellular, meaning they are biological entities that do not have a cellular structure. They therefore lack most of
the components of cells, such as organelles, ribosomes, and the plasma membrane. A virion consists of a nucleic acid core,
an outer protein coating or capsid, and sometimes an outer envelope made of protein and phospholipid membranes derived
from the host cell. Vi
