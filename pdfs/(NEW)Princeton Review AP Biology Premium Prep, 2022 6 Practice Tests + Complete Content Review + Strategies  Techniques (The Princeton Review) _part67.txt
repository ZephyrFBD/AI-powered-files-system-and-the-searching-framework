y 10% of energy is used to build biomass for the next level.
The primary consumers would have approximately 298.7 g/m2 of biomass, and the secondary consumers
would have approximately 29.87 g/m2 of biomass.

A
The question states that the change affects the place where the substrate binds, which is defined as the
active site. Position A is identified as the active site.
38.
D
Position B has nonpolar residues and is not the active site, since Position A is the active site. Therefore,
(A) is not correct since the substrate does not bind at Position B. It doesnâ€™t look like it is where the
homodimer is, so (C) is incorrect. There is no information to indicate (B). Nonpolar residues are known to
be helpful for inserting into the lipid bilayer, which makes (D) a strong answer.

D
A homodimer is formed when more than one polypeptide subunit come together. This is defined as a
quaternary structure, (D).
40.
C
The protein is known to be a homodimer, so it must have two polypeptides in it.
