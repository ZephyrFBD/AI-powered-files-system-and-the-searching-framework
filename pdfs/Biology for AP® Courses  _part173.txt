ucting their molecules, even though molecular nitrogen, N2, is the most abundant gas in
the atmosphere. Molecular nitrogen consists of two nitrogen atoms triple bonded to each other and, as with all molecules,

the sharing of these three pairs of electrons between the two nitrogen atoms allows for the filling of their outer electron
shells, making the molecule more stable than the individual nitrogen atoms. This strong triple bond makes it difficult for
living systems to break apart this nitrogen in order to use it as constituents of proteins and DNA.
The formation of water molecules provides an example of covalent bonding. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine
to form water molecules are bound together by covalent bonds, as shown in Figure 2.9. The electron from the hydrogen
splits its time between the incomplete outer shell of the hydrogen atoms and the incomplete outer shell of the oxygen atoms.
To completely fill the outer shell of
