Energy and Metabolism/Coupled Reactions
Life requires a constant input of energy to power cellular processes and maintain order in living systems. The energy
input into the cell must be greater than the energy requirements of the cell in order to maintain life. Processes that
release energy can be paired (or coupled) with processes that require energy. These coupled reactions, as shown in
Figure 7.4, occur in multiple steps to allow for the controlled transfer of energy between molecules, leading to more
efficiency.
Figure 7.4 Coupled Reactions
Coupling an exergonic reaction with an endergonic reaction allows the energy released by the exergonic reaction
to “drive” the endergonic reaction. For example, the breakdown of ATP into ADP and a phosphate group (Pi) is
exergonic and releases approximately 30 kilojoules of energy per mole of ATP:
