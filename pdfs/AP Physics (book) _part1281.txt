sound level?
RESPONSE The intensity of four trumpets is four times the intensity of one
trumpet
or
The sound level of the four trumpets would be
since log 4 = 0.60.

EXERCISE B From Table 12–2, we see that ordinary conversation corresponds to a
sound level of about 65 dB. If two people are talking at once, the sound level is 
(a) 65 dB, (b) 68 dB, (c) 75 dB, (d) 130 dB, (e) 62 dB.

Airplane roar. The sound level measured 30 m from a jet
plane is 140 dB. Estimate the sound level at 300 m. (Ignore reflections from the
ground.)
APPROACH Given the sound level, we can determine the intensity at 30 m using
Eq. 12–1. Because intensity decreases as the square of the distance, ignoring
reflec
