39. Use conservation of angular momentum to estimate the
angular velocity of a neutron star which has collapsed to a
diameter of 16 km, from a star whose core radius was equal
to that of Earth 
Assume its mass is 1.5 times
that of the Sun, and that it rotated (like our Sun) about once
a month.
40. By what factor does the rotational kinetic energy change
when the star in Problem 39 collapses to a neutron star?
41. Suppose that three main-sequence stars could undergo the
three changes represented by the three arrows, A, B, and C,
in the H–R diagram of Fig. 33–35. For each case, describe
the changes in temperature, intrinsic luminosity, and size.

42. Assume that the nearest stars to us have an intrinsic
luminosity about the same as the Sun’s. Their apparent
