46. The figure above shows a model of a ligand precursor being cleaved to produce an active ligand that binds to a 
specific receptor. Which of the following is most likely to reduce the binding of the active ligand to its receptor? 
(A) A change in the cytoskeletal attachment of transmembrane proteins 
(B) The presence of a large amount of the precursor form of the ligand 
(C) An increase in the ratio of the number of unsaturated to the number of saturated fatty acid tails of the 
membrane lipids 
(D) A mutation in the receptor gene that causes a substitution of a charged amino acid for a nonpolar amino acid 
in the ligand binding site of the receptor
