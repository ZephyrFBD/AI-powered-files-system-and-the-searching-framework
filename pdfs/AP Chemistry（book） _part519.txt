of the compound.
 3.97 A compound, KBrOx, where x is unknown, is analyzed and 
found to contain 52.92% Br. What is the value of x?
 3.98 An element X forms an iodide 1XI32 and a chloride 1XCl32. 
The iodide is quantitatively converted to the chloride when 
it is heated in a stream of chlorine:
 
 
2 XI3 + 3 Cl2 ¡ 2 XCl3 + 3 I2
 
 If 0.5000 g of XI3 is treated with chlorine, 0.2360 g of XCl3 is 
obtained. (a) Calculate the atomic weight of the element X. 
(b) Identify the element X.
 3.99 A method used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) for determining the concentration of ozone in air is to pass 
the air sample through a “bubbler” containing sodium iodide, 
which removes the ozone according to the following equation:
 
  O31g2 + 2 NaI1aq2 + H2O1l2 ¡
 O21g2 + I21s2 + 2 NaOH1aq2
 
 (a) How many moles of sodium iodide are needed to remove 
5.95 * 10-6 mol of O3? (b) How many grams of sodium io-
dide are needed to remove 1.3 mg of O3?
