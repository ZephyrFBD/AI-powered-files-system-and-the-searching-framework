p the xylem in plants through capillary action. (See Figure 3.3.)
Figure 3.3 Capillary Action
Having a high specific heat: As a result of water’s ability to form hydrogen bonds, more energy is required to
separate water molecules during phase changes, giving water a high specific heat. When a person sweats, the
water in the sweat on the skin absorbs heat from the person’s body as the water/sweat evaporates, having a
cooling effect on the person’s body temperature.
Moderating climate: Since water has a high heat capacity, it can absorb and release large amounts of energy.
This stabilizes climates in locations near large bodies of water. (See Figure 3.4.)

Expanding upon freezing: Since water has the ability to form hydrogen bonds, there is more space between
water molecules in the solid state than in the liquid state. As a result, ice has a lower density than that of liquid
water, and thus ice floats on liquid water. This has profoun
