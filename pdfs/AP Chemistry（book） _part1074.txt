a 
valence electron in ﬂuorine, Slater’s rules tell us that 
S = 10.35 * 62 + 10.85 * 22 = 3.8. (Slater’s rules ig-
nore the contribution of an electron to itself in screen-
ing; therefore, we consider only six n = 2 electrons, 
not all seven). Thus, Zeff = Z - S = 9 - 3.8 = 5.2+, 
a  
little lower than the simple estimate of 9 - 2 = 7+.
Values of Zeff estimated using the simple method 
outlined in the text, as well as those estimated with 
Slater’s rules, are plotted in Figure 7.5. While neither 
of these methods exactly replicates the values of Zeff 
obtained from more sophisticated calculations, both 
methods effectively capture the periodic variation 
in Zeff. While Slater’s approach is more accurate, the 
method outlined in the text does a reasonably good 
job of estimating Zeff despite its simplicity. For our 
purposes, therefore, we can assume that the screening 
constant S in Equation 7.1 is roughly equal to the num-
ber of core electrons.
