w in the soil. A lectin-like protein was found in the soil around the soybean 
roots. This protein may have been secreted by the fungus. Lectins induce mitosis in 
some root apical meristem tissues. In many instances, rapid cell divisions weaken plant 
tissues.  
You have been asked to investigate whether the fungal pathogen lectin affects the 
number of cells undergoing mitosis in a different plant, using root tips. 
•  What is your experimental hypothesis? Your null hypothesis? Are these the same? 
•  How would you design an experiment with onion bulbs to test whether lectins  
increase the number of cells in mitosis?  
•  What would you measure, and how would you measure it? 
•  What would be an appropriate control for your experiment? 
Your teacher will provide you with untreated and lectin-exposed roots. You should be 
comfortable identifying cells in mitosis or in interphase before you begin examining the 
chromosome squashes.
