’s Diversity Index = 1 – D = 0.756799
The Simpson’s Diversity Index increased, meaning that biodiversity of the ecosystem increased.
c. Predict what would happen to the biodiversity if there was an invasive insect species introduced into this
ecosystem.
The addition of an invasive species is likely to decrease the biodiversity of the ecosystem.
d. Justify your prediction.
Since invasive species are unlikely to have a natural predator, they will likely increase in number and consume a large
portion of the resources, leading to other organisms being unable to consume those numbers and decreasing in number.
Therefore, a greater percentage of the organisms would be made up of the invasive species, while fewer would be made
up of the original species, decreasing the biodiversity.
Question 5
a. Explain how it is possible for a person to have two rare unlinked genetic diseases at the same time.
Everybody has thousands of genes, and it is possible for a person to have mutations in more than on
