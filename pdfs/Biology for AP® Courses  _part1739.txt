Objective
3.18 The student is able to describe the connection between the regulation of gene
expression and observed differences between different kinds of organisms.
For a cell to function properly, necessary proteins must be synthesized at the proper time. All cells control or regulate the
synthesis of proteins from information encoded in their DNA. The process of turning on a gene to produce RNA and protein
is called gene expression. Whether in a simple unicellular organism or a complex multi-cellular organism, each cell controls
