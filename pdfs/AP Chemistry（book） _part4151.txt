23.93 (a) Yes, the oxidation state of Co is +3 in both complexes. 
(b) Compound A has SO4
2 -  outside the coordination sphere and 
coordinated Br-, so it forms a precipitate with BaCl21aq2 but not 
AgNO31aq2. Compound B has Br- outside the coordination sphere 
and coordinated SO4
2 -  so it forms a precipitate with AgNO31aq2 
but not BaCl21aq2. (c) Compounds A and B are coordination sphere 
isomers. (d) Both compounds are strong electrolytes. 23.96 The 
chemical formula is 3Pd1NC5H522Br24. This is an electrically neutral 
square-planar complex of Pd(II), a nonelectrolyte whose solutions 
do not conduct electricity. Because the dipole moment is zero, it 
must be the trans isomer. 23.98 47.3 mg Mg2 + >L, 53.4 mg Ca2 + >L
