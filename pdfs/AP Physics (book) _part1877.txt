(Section 19–6). Initially, when the capacitor is uncharged, no work is required to
move the first bit of charge over. As more charge is transferred, work is needed
to move charge against the increasing voltage V. The work needed to add a small
amount of charge 
when a potential difference V is across the plates, is
The total work needed to move total charge Q is equivalent to
moving all the charge Q across a voltage equal to the average voltage during 
the process. (This is just like calculating the work done to compress a spring,
Section 6–4, page 148.) The average voltage is
where 
is the
final voltage; so the work to move the total charge Q from one plate to the other is
Thus we can say that the electric potential energy, PE, stored in a capacitor is
where V is the potential difference between the plates (we dropped the subscript),
and Q is the charge on each plate. Since
we can also write
