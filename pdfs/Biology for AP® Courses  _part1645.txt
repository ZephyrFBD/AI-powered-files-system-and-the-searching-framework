are the primary sources of heritable information.
The Science Practice Challenge Questions contain additional test questions for this section that will help you prepare for
the AP exam. These questions address the following standards:

Prokaryotes and eukaryotes perform fundamentally the same process of transcription, with a few key differences. The most
important difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the latterâ€™s membrane-bound nucleus and organelles. With the
genes bound in a nucleus, the eukaryotic cell must be able to transport its mRNA to the cytoplasm and must protect its
mRNA from degrading before it is translated. Eukaryotes also employ three different polymerases that each transcribe a
different subset of genes. Eukaryotic mRNAs are usually monogenic, meaning that they specify a single protein.
Initiation of Tr
