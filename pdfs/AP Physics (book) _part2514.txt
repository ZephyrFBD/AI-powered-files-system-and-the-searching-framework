be yourself as

objects look as if they are in front of you, beyond the mirror. But what you see in
the mirror is an image of the objects, including yourself, that are in front of the
mirror. Also, you don’t see yourself as others see you, because left and right appear
reversed in the image.
A plane mirror is one with a smooth flat reflecting surface. Figure 23–7 shows
how an image is formed by a plane mirror according to the ray model. We are
viewing the mirror, on edge, in the diagram of Fig. 23–7, and the rays are shown
reflecting from the front surface. (Good mirrors are generally made by putting a
highly reflective metallic coating on one surface of a very flat piece of glass.) Rays
from two different points on an object (the bottle on the left in Fig. 23–7) are
shown: two rays are shown leaving from a point on the top of the bottle, and two
more from a point on the bottom. Rays leave each point on th
