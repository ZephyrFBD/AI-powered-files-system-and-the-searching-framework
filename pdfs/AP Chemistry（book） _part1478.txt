▲ Figure 9.47 Definitions of the highest occupied and lowest 
unoccupied molecular orbitals. The energy difference between these 
is the HOMO-LUMO gap.
The energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO—
known as the HOMO–LUMO gap—is related to the minimum 
 
energy needed to excite an electron in the molecule. Colorless or 
Asked to identify the major technological challenge for the twen-
ty-first century, you might say “energy,” reasoning that development 
of sustainable energy sources is crucial to meet the needs of future 
generations of people on our planet. One of the most remarkable 
sources of clean energy is the Sun, which sends enough energy to 
power the world for millions of years. Our challenge is to capture 
enough of this energy in a form that allows us to use it as needed
