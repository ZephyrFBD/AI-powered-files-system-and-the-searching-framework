 giving
different dispersal patterns. However, both the
populations may be dispersed randomly
throughout the range, giving identical population
densities.
b.
Two populations could occupy the different
range with the different number of individuals,
giving different dispersal patterns. However,
both the populations may move over this range
in a herd, giving identical population densities.
c.
Two populations could occupy the same range
with the different number of individuals, giving
identical population densities. However, one
population may move over this range in a herd
while the other population may be dispersed
randomly throughout the range.
d.
Two populations could occupy the same range
with the same number of individuals, giving
identical population densities. However, one
population may move over this range in a herd
while the other population may be dispersed
randomly throughout the range.
55. A population is observed to have very large numbers
of very young individuals, but ver
