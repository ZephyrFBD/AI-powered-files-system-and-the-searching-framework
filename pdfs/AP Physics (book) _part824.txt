 and the lever arm in (a) is given. In (b) we have
to take into account the angle to get the lever arm.
SOLUTION (a) 
and 
so
(b) Because the arm is at an angle below the horizontal, the lever arm is shorter
(Fig. 8–14c) than in part (a):
where 
is the
angle between 
and r. F is still 700 N, so
The arm can exert less torque at this angle than when it is at 90°. Weight machines
at gyms are often designed to take this variation with angle into account.
NOTE In (b), we could instead have used 
As shown in Fig. 8–14d,
Then 
gives the
same result.
t = rF
⊥= rF sin u = (0.050 m)(700 N)(0.866)
F
⊥= F sin 60°.
t = rF
⊥.
t = (0.050 m)(0.866)(700 N) = 30 mN.

B
u = 60°
r⊥= (0.050 m)(sin 60°),
t = r⊥F = (0.050 m)(700 N) = 35 mN.
r⊥= 0.050 m,
F = 700 N

EXERCISE B Two forces (
and 
) are applied to a meter stick which
can rotate about its left end, Fig. 8–15. Force 
is applied perpendicularly at the mid-
point. Which force exerts the greater torque:
or both the same?
