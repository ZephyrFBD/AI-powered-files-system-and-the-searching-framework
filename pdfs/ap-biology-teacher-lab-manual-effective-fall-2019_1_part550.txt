Step 4 Place both tubes on (into) the ice. 
Step 5 Use a sterile inoculation loop to pick up a single colony of bacteria from your 
starter plate. Be careful not to scrape off any agar from the plate. Pick up the “+ plasmid” 
tube and immerse the loop into the CaCl2 solution (transforming solution) at the bottom 
of the tube. Spin the loop between your index finger and thumb until the entire colony is 
dispersed in the solution. Appropriately discard the loop. 
Step 6 Use a new sterile 100–1,000 μL micropipette to repeatedly pulse the cells in 
solution to thoroughly resuspend the cells. (Note that the clear transformation solution 
will become cloudy as the E. coli cells are suspended.) Place the tube back on the ice. 
Step 7 Using a new sterile inoculation loop, repeat Steps 5 and 6 for the “- plasmid” tube. 
 
CAUTION: Keep your nose and mouth away from the tip end when pipetting
