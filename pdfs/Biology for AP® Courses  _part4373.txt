Connection for AP® Courses
While looking at the logistic model is very useful when studying population dynamics, additional methods are used when
considering more complex situations, such as changes in the carrying capacity of the environment. Abiotic and biotic factors
can affect the growth and death rates of a population, so these fluctuations also require consideration when modeling a
population’s change over time. Sometimes, scientists need to consider how reproductive strategies play a part into the
dynamics of a population over time. To consider how these different factors interact, populations are looked at from a variety
of perspectives.
