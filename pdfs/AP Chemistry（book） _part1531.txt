Place the following molecules and ions in order from small-
est to largest bond order: H2

+, and Ne2.
 
[9.107]  The following sketches show the atomic orbital wave func-
tions (with phases) used to construct some of the MOs of 
a homonuclear diatomic molecule. For each sketch, de-
termine the type of MO that will result from mixing the 
atomic orbital wave functions as drawn. Use the same labels 
for the MOs as in the “Closer Look” box on phases.

Molecules that are brightly colored have a small energy 
gap between filled and empty electronic states (the 
 
HOMO-LUMO gap; see Exercise 9.104). Sometimes you 
can visually tell which HOMO-LUMO gap is larger for one 
molecule than another. Suppose you have samples of two 
crystalline powders—one is white, and one is green. Which 
one has the larger HOMO-LUMO gap?
