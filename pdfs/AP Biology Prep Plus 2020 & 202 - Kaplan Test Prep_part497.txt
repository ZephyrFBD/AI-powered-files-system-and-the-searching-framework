The response of the activated platelets is a negative feedback
mechanism because it stops the loss of blood.
(A)
Activation of platelets is a positive feedback loop because it
acts as an amplifier of the response.
(B)
Platelets do not respond to positive feedback because there
would be no way to shut oﬀ activation once the damage is
repaired.
(C)
The response of the activated platelets promotes an increase
in the total number of platelets.
(D)
6. The temperature setpoint of the body is determined by the
hypothalamus. When core body temperature rises above the
setpoint, responses such as sweating bring about cooling. When
the temperature drops below it, warming mechanisms, such as
narrowing of blood vessels and shivering, increase body
temperature. A child develops a temperature of 40°C (104°F)
because an ear infection has reset her hypothalamus to a higher
core body temperature. Which of the following symptoms would
the child most likely experience while the infection persist
