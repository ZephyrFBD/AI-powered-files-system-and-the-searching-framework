osmolalities of the organisms?
(A) Sodium is added to the sealed tank.
(B) Chloride is injected into the organism.
(C) Glucose is ingested by the organism.
(D) Water is added to the sealed tank.
4. Which of the following statements best describes the insides of these organisms compared to the environment
in the tank when they reach osmoconformity?
(A) Due to the influx of water into the organisms’ cells, the organisms’ insides are hypertonic when compared
to the tank.
(B) Compared to the tank, the loss of water out of the organisms’ cells makes the organisms’ insides hypotonic.
(C) The organisms’ insides are isotonic since the intracellular osmolality concentrations match the osmolality
concentrations of the tank.
(D) The flow of water into and out of the organisms’ insides causes the cells to be retrotonic.
5. A population of organisms that are not osmoconformers is dropped into the tank with Organism 1. The
intracellular osmolality of Organism 1 begins to slightly decrease. Which of
