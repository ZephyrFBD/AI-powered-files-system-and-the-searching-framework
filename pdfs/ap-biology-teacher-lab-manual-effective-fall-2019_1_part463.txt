ound microscopes 
1. Place a drop of water onto the microscope slide. 
2. Gently scrape some perithecia from the agar plate near where the two strains meet. 
3. Place a cover slip over the perithecia and put a scientific cleaning wipe over the 
cover slip. 
4. Gently press down on the cover slip using the eraser end of a pencil. 
5. Count at least 50 asci, and score them as either parental or recombinant (crossing 
over). 
6. Record your results in Table 6.

Gene to Centromere 
Distance (map units) 
The published map distance between the gene and the centromere is 26 map units. How 
did the class data compare with this distance? What can account for disparities between 
the class data and the published data?
