 how nature behaves (that electric charge is conserved, for example).
Often the statement takes the form of a relationship or equation between
quantities (such as Newton’s second law,
).
Statements that we call laws are usually experimentally valid over a wide
range of observed phenomena. For less general statements, the term principle
is often used (such as Archimedes’ principle). We use “theory” for a more
general picture of the phenomena dealt with.
Scientific laws are different from political laws in that the latter are prescrip-
tive: they tell us how we ought to behave. Scientific laws are descriptive: they do
not say how nature should behave, but rather are meant to describe how nature
does behave. As with theories, laws cannot be tested in the infinite variety of
cases possible. So we cannot be sure that any law is absolutely true. We use the
term “law” when its validity has been tested over a wide range of cases, and
when any limitations and the range of validity are clearly u
