13. A student wants to test whether treating onion root cells with caffeine will significantly increase the number of
cells in mitosis. Two groups of onions are grown: one group received distilled water, and the other received
distilled water with caffeine. The root tips of both groups are harvested and stained, and the number of cells in
interphase and mitosis in each group is counted. The expected and observed data are shown in the following
table.
(a) State the null hypothesis for this experiment.
(b) Identify the independent variable and the dependent variable.
(c) Use the chi-square equation and a p-value of 0.05 to analyze the data. Determine if there is a statistically
significant difference between the two groups of onions.
(d) Justify your conclusion from part (c).
