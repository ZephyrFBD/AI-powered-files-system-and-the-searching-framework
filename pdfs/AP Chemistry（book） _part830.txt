 Indicate which of the following is independent of the path 
by which a change occurs: (a) the change in potential en-
ergy when a book is transferred from table to shelf, (b) the 
heat evolved when a cube of sugar is oxidized to CO21g2 and 
H2O1g2, (c) the work accomplished in burning a gallon of 
gasoline.
Enthalpy (section 5.3 and 5.4)
 5.31 During a normal breath, our lungs expand about 0.50 L 
against an external pressure of 1.0 atm. How much work is 
involved in this process (in J)?
 5.32 How much work (in J) is involved in a chemical reaction if 
the volume decreases from 5.00 to 1.26 L against a constant 
pressure of 0.857 atm?
 5.33 (a) Why is the change in enthalpy usually easier to measure 
than the change in internal energy? (b) H is a state function, 
but q is not a state function. Explain. (c) For a given process 
at constant pressure, âˆ†H is positive. Is the process endother-
mic or exothermic?
 5.34 (a) Under what condition will the enthalpy change of a 
process equal th
