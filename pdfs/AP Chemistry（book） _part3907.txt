 enantiomeric form. Many 
drugs of importance in human medicine are chiral, and the enantio-
mers may produce very different biochemical effects.
INTRODUCTION TO BIOCHEMISTRY; PROTEINS (SECTIONS 24.6 
AND 24.7) Many of the molecules that are essential for life are large 
natural polymers that are constructed from smaller molecules called 
monomers. Three of these biopolymers are considered in this chapter: 
proteins, polysaccharides (carbohydrates), and nucleic acids.
Proteins are polymers of amino acids. They are the major struc-
tural materials in animal systems. All naturally occurring proteins 
are formed from 22 amino acids, although only 20 are common. The 
amino acids are linked by peptide bonds. A polypeptide is a polymer 
formed by linking many amino acids by peptide bonds.
Amino acids are chiral substances. Usually only one of the en-
antiomers is found to be biologically active. Protein structure is de-
termined by the sequence of amino acids in the chain (its primary
