Figure 32.10 Some unicellular organisms, such as the amoeba, ingest food by endocytosis. The food vesicle fuses
with a lysosome, which digests the food. Waste is excreted by exocytosis.
Flame Cells of Planaria and Nephridia of Worms
As multi-cellular systems evolved to have organ systems that divided the metabolic needs of the body, individual organs
evolved to perform the excretory function. Planaria are flatworms that live in fresh water. Their excretory system consists of
two tubules connected to a highly branched duct system. The cells in the tubules are called flame cells (or protonephridia)
because they have a cluster of cilia that looks like a flickering flame when viewed under the microscope, as illustrated
in Figure 32.11a. The cilia propel waste matter down the tubules and out of the body through excretory pores that open
on the body surface; cilia also draw water from the interstitial fluid, allowing for filtration. Any valuable metabolites are
recovered by reabsorption
