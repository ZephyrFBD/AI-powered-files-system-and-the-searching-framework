tates for the thermodynamic state. (That is where the 
statistical part of the name statistical thermodynamics comes 
in.) Each thermodynamic state has a characteristic number of 
microstates associated with it, and we will use the symbol W 
for that number.
Students sometimes have difficulty distinguishing 
between the state of a system and the microstates associated 
with the state.
t A state describes the macroscopic view of the system as 
characterized, for example, by the pressure and tempera-
ture of a sample of gas.
t A microstate is a particular microscopic arrangement of the 
atoms or molecules of the system that corresponds to the 
given state of the system.
Each of the snapshots we described is a microstateâ€”the posi-
tions and kinetic energies of individual gas molecules will 
change from snapshot to snapshot, but each one is a possible 
arrangement of the collection of molecules corresponding 
to a single state. For macroscopically sized systems, such as a 
mole of gas, t
