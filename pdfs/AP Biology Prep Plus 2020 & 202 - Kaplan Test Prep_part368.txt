ation of the substrate without
increasing the concentration of the enzyme has no eﬀect on
the reaction rate.
(C)
Raising the temperature increases the reaction rate until an
optimal temperature is reached, at which point the reaction
rate decreases again.

5. Researchers studied the activity of mevalonate kinase, an enzyme
that may be important for biofuel production. The graph below
shows the rate of a reaction as the concentration of ATP is
increased while substrate concentration remains constant. The
open circles represent data points collected at 30°C and the
closed circles represent data points collected at 37°C.
How is the reaction between enzyme and substrate modified by
the diﬀerent temperatures?

Saccharomyces cerevisiae,” PLoS ONE 9, no. 1 (January

At 30°C, the substrate molecules have less kinetic energy
than at 37°C. This reduces the rate of random collisions and
