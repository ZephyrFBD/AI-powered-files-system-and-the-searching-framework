 vicinity of a star
6.6 light-years from Earth. Passengers on the ship want the
(one-way) trip to take no more than 1.0 year. How much
work must be done on the spaceship to bring it to the
speed necessary for this trip?
73. Suppose a 14,500-kg spaceship left Earth at a speed of 0.90c.
What is the spaceship’s kinetic energy? Compare with the
total U.S. annual energy consumption (about 
).
74. A pi meson of mass 
decays at rest into a muon (mass 
)
and a neutrino of negligible or zero mass. Show that the
kinetic energy of the muon is
75. An astronaut on a spaceship traveling at 0.75c relative to
Earth measures his ship to be 23 m long. On the ship, he
eats his lunch in 28 min. (a) What length is the spaceship
according to observers on Earth? (b) How long does the
astronaut’s lunch take to eat according to observers on Earth?

be 6.0 light-years (
light travels in 1 year).
