neous equilibria involving the Mg2 +  or OH- ions, 
calculate Ksp for this compound.
The Ksp for CaF2 is 3.9 * 10-11 at 25 Â°C. Assuming equilibrium is established between solid and dissolved CaF2, and that  
there are no other important equilibria affecting its solubility, calculate the solubility of CaF2 in grams per liter.
(Remember that 2
3 y = y1>3.) Thus, the molar 
solubility of CaF2 is 2.1 * 10-4 mol>L.
Analyze We are given Ksp for CaF2 and asked to determine solubil-
ity. Recall that the solubility of a substance is the quantity that 
can dissolve in solvent, whereas the solubility-product constant, 
Ksp, is an equilibrium constant.
Plan To go from Ksp to solubility, we follow the steps indicated by 
the red arrows in Figure 17.16. We first write the chemical equation 
Check We expect a small number for the solubility of a slightly soluble 
salt. If we reverse the calculation, we should be able to recalculate the 
solubility product: Ksp = 12.1 * 10-4214.2 * 10-422 = 3.7 * 10-1
