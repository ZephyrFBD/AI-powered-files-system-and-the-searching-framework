t than do mammals.
Despite the fact that the requirement for being an endotherm is so great,
it may have given birds and mammals a critical advantage during the time
when ancient Earth was dominated by reptiles. Perhaps being able to
maintain a high body temperature made it possible for mammals and birds
to invade and colonize colder environments that reptiles found
uninhabitable.

Poikilotherms and Homeotherms
You may see the terms poikilotherm (having a body temperature that
varies with the environment) and homeotherm (having a constant body
temperature despite fluctuations in environmental temperature). However,
these terms are not always meaningful. When discussing thermoregulation,
the real issue is not whether an animal has variable or constant body
temperature but, rather, the source of heat used to maintain its body
temperature. For example, some scientists classify a fish as a poikilotherm.
However, many fish inhabit water that has s
