s (IREs). IREs have been observed in a 
number of genes involved in iron transport and 
metabolism. The IRE sequences found in the 
ferritin gene are found in all multicellular 
organisms, whereas other nonferritin IRE 
sequences are found only in certain vertebrate 
organisms. Which of the following is the best 
explanation for the observations? 
(A) Ferritin IREs arose in the common ancestor 
of multicellular organisms, whereas 
nonferritin IREs arose later in specific 
evolutionary lineages. 
(B) Nonferritin IREs arose at different times in 
the common ancestor of multicellular 
organisms. 
(C) Ferritin IREs arose in diverse organisms by 
convergent evolution, while the nonferritin 
IREs arose by recombination events 
between closely related species. 
(D) Ferritin IREs have evolved independently 
 in 
different evolutionary lineages, whereas 
nonferritin IREs arose in the common 
ancestor of multicellular organisms.
