† Band gap energies are room temperature values, 1 eV = 1.602 × 10−19 J.
‡ These data are for gray tin, the semiconducting allotrope of tin. The other allotrope, white tin, is a metal.
Will GaP have a larger or smaller band gap than ZnS? Will it have a larger or smaller band gap than GaN?
Sample Exercise 12.3 
Qualitative Comparison of Semiconductor Band Gaps
SOLUTION
Analyze The size of the band gap depends on the vertical and hor-
izontal positions of the elements in the periodic table. The band 
gap will increase when either of the following conditions is met: 
(1) The elements are located higher up in the periodic table, where 
enhanced orbital overlap leads to a larger splitting between bond
