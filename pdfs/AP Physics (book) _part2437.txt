. It is based
on the idea of symmetry in nature. Indeed, the size of the effect in most cases is so
small that Maxwell recognized it would be difficult to detect it experimentally.
Maxwell’s Fourth Equation (Ampère’s Law Extended)
To back up the idea that a changing electric field might produce a magnetic field,
we use an indirect argument that goes something like this. According to Ampère’s
law (Section 20–8),
That is, divide any closed path you choose into
short segments 
multiply each segment by the parallel component of the mag-
netic field B at that segment, and then sum all these products over the complete
closed path. That sum will then equal 
times the total current I that passes
through a surface bounded by the path. When we applied Ampère’s law to the
field around a straight wire (Section 20–8), we imagined the current as passing
through the circular area enclosed by our circular loop. That area is the flat 
surface 1 shown in Fig. 22–2. However, we could just as well use the
