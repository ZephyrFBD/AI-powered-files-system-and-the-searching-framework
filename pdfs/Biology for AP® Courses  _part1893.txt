Is the hypothesis correct? Why or why not?
Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) is a searchable online catalog of human genes and genetic disorders. This
website shows genome mapping information, and also details the history and research of each trait and disorder. Click
this link (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/OMIM) to search for traits (such as handedness) and genetic disorders (such as
diabetes).
How can this database help to support and guide research for rare genetic conditions, like progeria?
a.
The database provides information related to the prevention of a genetic disease.
b.
The database provides all the information about genes for genetic diseases, their inheritance and their
expression. It also provides suggestions for some treatments.
c.
The database provides information about the symptoms of the disease.
d.
The database provides information only about the early reported cases.
