 the trachea, and into the lungs. In the lungs, air passes through the
branching bronchi, reaching the respiratory bronchioles, which house the first site of gas exchange. The respiratory
bronchioles open into the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. Because there are so many alveoli and alveolar sacs in
the lung, the surface area for gas exchange is very large. Several protective mechanisms are in place to prevent damage or
infection. These include the hair and mucus in the nasal cavity that trap dust, dirt, and other particulate matter before they
can enter the system. In the lungs, particles are trapped in a mucus layer and transported via cilia up to the esophageal
opening at the top of the trachea to be swallowed.
30.2 Gas Exchange across Respiratory Surfaces
The lungs can hold a large volume of air, but they are not usually filled to maximal capacity. Lung volume measurements
include tidal volume, expiratory reserve volume, inspiratory reserve volume, and residual volume.
