K-41 is one of the naturally occurring isotopes of potassium. Use the periodic table to explain how the structure of
K-41 differs from the normal K atom.
a.
K-41 has a total of 24 neutrons and normal K atom has 22 neutrons
b.
K-41 has a total of 22 neutrons and normal K atom has 20 neutrons
c.
K-41 has one more neutron than the normal K atom
d.
K-41 has one less neutron than normal K atom
The Periodic Table
The different elements are organized and displayed in the periodic table. Devised by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev
(1834â€“1907) in 1869, the table groups elements that, although unique, share certain chemical properties with other
elements. The properties of elements are responsible for their physical state at room temperature: they may be gases, solids,
or liquids. Elements also have specific chemical reactivity, the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other.
In the periodic table, shown in Figure 2.5, the elements are organized and displayed accor
