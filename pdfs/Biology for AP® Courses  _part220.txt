omers are mirror images of each other.
Which of the following statements is false?
a.
Molecules with the formulas CH3 CH2 COOH and C3 H6 O2 could be structural isomers.
b.
Molecules must have a double bond to be cis-trans isomers.
c.
To be enantiomers, a molecule must have at least three different atoms or groups connected to a central
carbon.
d.
To be enantiomers, a molecule must have at least four different atoms or groups connected to a central
carbon.
In triglycerides (fats and oils), long carbon chains known as fatty acids may contain double bonds, which can be in either
the cis or trans configuration, illustrated in Figure 2.27. Fats with at least one double bond between carbon atoms are
unsaturated fats. When some of these bonds are in the cis configuration, the resulting bend in the carbon backbone of the
chain means that triglyceride molecules cannot pack tightly, so they remain liquid (oil) at room temperature. On the other
