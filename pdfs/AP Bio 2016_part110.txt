o position in the 
egg. The results are shown in Figure 1. 
(a) Indicate whether the researcherâ€™s claim that turtle embryos within their eggs respond to thermal cues is 
supported or not supported. Using the data, justify your response. 
(b) The researcher used the dorsal heat treatment as the control. Propose a different treatment that would have 
been another valid control. 
(c) The researcher hypothesizes that when turtle embryos respond to thermal cues they develop more rapidly 
than do turtle embryos that do not respond to thermal cues. Describe ONE potential advantage for turtles 
having a shorter embryonic period.
