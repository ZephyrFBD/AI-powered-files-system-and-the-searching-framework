Cooperation within a population can provide protection from predators and acquisition of prey and resources.
Competition decreases the availability for use by others, so the less competitive individual will be forced to go
elsewhere.
In 2015, Species A became extinct, suggesting Species B is a predator of Species A.
(c) Based on the data, determine the ecological relationship between Species B and C. (1

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Over the last 60 years, Species C decreased and Species B increased. It is plausible that
Species B is a predator of Species C and that the expansion of Species B’s population has
resulted in a decline in the population in Species C. Alternatively, the slight decline in Species
C over the previous 30 years could mean that it has reached its carrying capacity.
(d) Explain how symbiosis between two diﬀerent organisms drives population
dynamics. (1 point)
