idence that traits were carried
on chromosomes. Critics pointed out that individuals had far more independently segregating traits than they had
chromosomes. It was only after several years of carrying out crosses with the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, that
Thomas Hunt Morgan provided experimental evidence to support the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance.
Genetic Linkage and Distances
Mendel’s work suggested that traits are inherited independently of each other. Morgan identified a 1:1 correspondence
between a segregating trait and the X chromosome, suggesting that the random segregation of chromosomes was the
physical basis of Mendel’s model. This also demonstrated that linked genes disrupt Mendel’s predicted outcomes. The fact
that each chromosome can carry many linked genes explains how individuals can have many more traits than they have
chromosomes. However, observations by researchers in Morgan’s laboratory suggested that alleles positioned on the same
chromosome were not a
