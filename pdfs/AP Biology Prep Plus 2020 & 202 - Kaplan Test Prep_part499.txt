process of photosynthesis. Autotrophs do not need an exogenous supply
of organic compounds. Heterotrophic organisms obtain their energy
12.1 Describe energy flow in biological systems
12.2 Explain how the laws of thermodynamics apply to living systems
12.3 Describe how changes in energy aﬀect living systems
catabolically, via the breakdown of organic nutrients that must be
ingested. Note in the following energy flow diagram that some energy is
dissipated as heat at every stage.
Energy Flow
THERMODYNAMICS
Thermodynamics deals with heat, energy, and work and can be discussed
in terms of temperature, internal energy, entropy, and pressure. For the
AP Biology exam, you should be familiar with the three laws of
thermodynamics.
The First Law of Thermodynamics
The first law maintains that the increase in internal energy of a closed
system is equal to the diﬀerence of the heat supplied to the system and
the work done by the system. This is a variation of the la
