 tissue, seeds, etc.) seem to have evolved first in
evolutionary history. This exercise is meant to test your ability to articulate the data in the chart and to
draw the above cladogram. You also may be asked to analyze a cladogram, like the one above.
Exercise 3B:
Constructing a Cladogram from Gene Percent Similarities to Humans
Organism
Gene Similarity
#1
97%
#2
92%
#3
78%
#4
62%
Interpretation of this Exercise
The above chart shows the percentage similarity that each of the organisms #1â€“#4 are similar to
humans. According to the above chart, organism #1 is the most similar, in reference to this gene, to
humans. This exercise is meant to test your ability to articulate the data in the chart and to draw the
above cladogram. This particular type of cladogram is meant to show the percentage similarities;
therefore, the approximate placement of each of the branches is important.
The BLAST sequence analysis tool can also be used to determine how similar a specific gene,
nucleotide, or pro
