amount of deuterium needed to run this facility per year.
72. If a 65-kg power plant worker has been exposed to the maxi-
mum slow-neutron radiation for a given year, how much
total energy (in J) has that worker absorbed? What if he
were exposed to fast protons?
73. Consider the fission reaction
(a) What is X? (b) If this were part of a chain reaction in a
fission power reactor running at “barely critical,” what
would happen on average to the three produced neutrons?
(c) (optional) What is the Q-value of this reaction? [Hint: Mass
values can be found at www.nist.gov/pml/data/comp.cfm.]
