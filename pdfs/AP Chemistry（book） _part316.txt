Ionic Compounds
A great deal of chemical activity involves the transfer of electrons from one substance 
to another. Figure 2.20 shows that when elemental sodium is allowed to react with el-
emental chlorine, an electron transfers from a sodium atom to a chlorine atom, form-
ing a Na+ ion and a Cl- ion. Because objects of opposite charges attract, the Na+ and the 
 
Cl- ions bind together to form the compound sodium chloride (NaCl). Sodium chloride,
