The different types of neutrinos
are not identical
Energy and momentum are conserved. In addition to the
“number” conservation laws which help explain the decay schemes of particles,
we can also apply the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The decay
of a 
particle at rest with mass 
(Table 32–2 in Section 32–6) can
yield a proton 
and a neutral pion,
Determine the kinetic energies of the proton and 
.
APPROACH We find the energy release from the change in mass 
as
we did for nuclear processes (Eq. 30–2 or 31–2a). Then we apply conservation
of energy and momentum, using relativistic formulas as the energies are large.
