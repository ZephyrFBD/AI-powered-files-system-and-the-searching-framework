 5.100 An aluminum can of a soft drink is placed in a freezer. Later, 
you find that the can is split open and its contents have fro-
zen. Work was done on the can in splitting it open. Where 
did the energy for this work come from?
 5.101 Consider a system consisting of the following apparatus, in 
which gas is confined in one flask and there is a vacuum in 
the other flask. The flasks are separated by a valve. Assume 
that the flasks are perfectly insulated and will not allow the 
flow of heat into or out of the flasks to the surroundings. 
When the valve is opened, gas flows from the filled flask to 
the evacuated one. (a) Is work performed during the expan-
sion of the gas? (b) Why or why not? (c) Can you determine 
the value of âˆ†E for the process?
