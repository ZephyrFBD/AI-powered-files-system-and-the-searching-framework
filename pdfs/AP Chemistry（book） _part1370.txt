CHAPTER 9 Molecular Geometry and Bonding Theories
AB5 can be thought of as a trigonal planar AB3 arrangement with two additional atoms, 
one above and one below the equilateral triangle. The octahedral shape for AB6 has all six 
B atoms at the same distance from atom A with 90° B¬A¬B angles between all neigh-
boring B atoms. Its symmetric shape (and its name) is derived from the octahedron, with 
eight faces, all of which are equilateral triangles.
You may have noticed that some of the shapes we have already discussed are not 
among the five shapes in Figure 9.3. For example, in Figure 9.2, neither the bent shape 
of the SO2 molecule nor the trigonal pyramidal shape of the NF3 molecule is among 
the shapes in Figure 9.3. However, as we soon will see, we can derive addition
