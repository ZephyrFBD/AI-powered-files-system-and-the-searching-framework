g the reactants requires two Cr3+ 
among the products. The seven oxygen atoms 
in Cr2O7
2- are balanced by adding seven H2O 
to the products. The 14 hydrogen atoms in 
7 H2O are then balanced by adding 14 H+ to 
the reactants:
Balancing Equations for Reactions  
Occurring in Basic Solution
If a redox reaction occurs in basic solution, the equation must be balanced by using OH- 
and H2O rather than H+ and H2O. Because the water molecule and the hydroxide ion 
both contain hydrogen, this approach can take more moving back and forth from one 
side of the equation to the other to arrive at the appropriate half-reaction. There is an 
alternate approach.
How to Balance Redox Reactions in Basic Aqueous Solution
 
1. Balance the half-reactions as if they occurred in acidic solution.
 
2. Count the number of H+ in each half-reaction, and then add the same number of 
OH- to each side of the half-reaction.
Using this method, the reaction is mass-balanced because you are adding the same 
thing to
