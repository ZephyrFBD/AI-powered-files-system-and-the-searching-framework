Structure and Physical Properties of Polymers
The simple structural formulas given for polyethylene and other polymers are deceptive. 
Because four bonds surround each carbon atom in polyethylene, the atoms are arranged in 
a tetrahedral fashion, so that the chain is not straight as we have depicted it. Furthermore, 
the atoms are relatively free to rotate around the C ¬C single bonds. Rather than being 
straight and rigid, therefore, the chains are flexible, folding readily (Figure 12.39). The flexi-
bility in the molecular chains causes any material made of this polymer to be very flexible.
