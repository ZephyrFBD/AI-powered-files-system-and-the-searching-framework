s.
(c) Predict the effect of the EDS mutation on the structure of the procollagen protein.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
12. A mutation results in the deletion of the TATA box in the promoter of a eukaryotic gene.
(a) Describe the function of the promoter in gene expression.
(b) Explain why promoter sequences are highly conserved in living organisms.
(c) The figure that follows shows the gene and the DNA surrounding it. Draw an “X” on the most likely
location of the promoter of the gene.
(d) Explain how the deletion of the TATA box in the promoter would most likely affect the levels of protein
produced by the gene.

13. The levels of mRNA and protein produced by three different genes (PDHA1, MBP, and INS) were measured in
different tissues of the human body. The levels of mRNA and protein expression from these genes were
compared to mRNA and protein expression from the gene POLR2A (RNA polymerase II subunit A, which is
expressed in all human tissues). The
