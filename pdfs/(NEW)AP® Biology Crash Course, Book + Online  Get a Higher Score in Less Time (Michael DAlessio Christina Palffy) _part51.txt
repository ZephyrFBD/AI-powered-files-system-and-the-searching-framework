-carbon acetyl-CoA, releasing a molecule of CO2.
4. The following figure shows the conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl-CoA:
C. Krebs (or citric acid) Cycle—series of reactions that continually regenerates one of its first reactants,
oxaloacetic acid and contains the following important features:
1. The Krebs Cycle (citric acid cycle) produces the majority of NADH, FADH2, and CO2 (waste
product) for cellular respiration.
2. NADH and FADH2 carry electrons that were extracted during the Krebs Cycle reactions and carries
them to the electron transport chain.
3. ATP is synthesized from ADP and inorganic phosphates via phosphorylation, and coenzymes capture
electrons during this cycle.
4. The key intermediate, oxaloacetate (OAA) is added to acetyl-CoA to make citrate, which starts the
entire Krebs Cycle.
D. Electron Transport Chain—carried out by electron carriers that undergo a series of redox reactions as
electrons are passed from one carrier to another.
1. The following are the important
