than side B.
(B) Side B initially has a higher water potential than side A because side B has a higher solute concentration
than side A.
(C) Side A and side B initially have the same water potential because they are both aqueous solutions.
(D) Side A and side B initially have the same water potential because they both contain the same types of
solutes.
