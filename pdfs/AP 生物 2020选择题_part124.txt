Mendelian 
Genetics
(A) 
Incorrect. The passage states that the offspring produced were not 
entirely identical to the parents, indicating that the alleles are not paired.
(B) 
Incorrect. Recombination between sister chromatids would not produce 
new genetic variation because sister chromatids are identical copies of 
one another.
(C) 
Incorrect. Alleles of the same gene would not typically be found on 
nonhomologous chromosomes.
(D) 
Correct. A ratio of nine to one of offspring with yellow, round seeds to 
those with green, wrinkled seeds is expected as a result of genes that are 
independently assorted.
