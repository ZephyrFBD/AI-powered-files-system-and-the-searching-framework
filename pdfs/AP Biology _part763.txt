e invaded a
body. They stimulate other white blood cells by releasing cytokines.
Although macrophages secrete cytokines, they are not lymphocytes.
(A) Choice A describes exactly what cytotoxic T cells do. A fever is
an example of the second line of defense, which makes choice B
incorrect. Choice C is a false statement. All mammals have both
types of specific responses, which supports the important idea that
all mammals share a common ancestry. Choice D is not correct
because vaccines are specific. They only work against one type of
antigen, or one that is very similar to it.
(A) Clonal selection is a fundamental mechanism in the development
of immunity. An antigen is presented (by APCs) to a steady stream
of lymphocytes in lymph nodes until a match is found. This triggers
events that activate the lymphocyte. Once activated, the lymphocyte
divides rapidly, forming an army of clones that develop into effector
and memory cells.
(C) This is the second exposure to the antigen that stimulate
