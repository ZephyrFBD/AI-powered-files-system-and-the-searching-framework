. (a) Which 
valence atomic orbitals of P are used to construct the MOs of 
P2? (b) The figure that follows shows a sketch of one of the 
MOs for P2. What is the label for this MO? (c) For the P2 mole-
cule, how many electrons occupy the MO in the figure? (d) Is 
P2 expected to be diamagnetic or paramagnetic?
 [9.84]  The iodine bromide molecule, IBr, is an interhalogen compound. 
Assume that the molecular orbitals of IBr are analogous to 
the homonuclear diatomic molecule F2. (a) Which valence 
atomic orbitals of I and of Br are used to construct the MOs of 
IBr? (b) What is the bond order of the IBr molecule? (c) One of 
the valence MOs of IBr is sketched here. Why are the atomic 
orbital contributions to this MO different in size? (d) What is 
the label for the MO sketched below? (e) For the IBr molecule, 
how many electrons occupy the MO sketched below?
