f 
depends somewhat on
the temperature of the material.
Not only do shiny surfaces emit less radiation, but they absorb little of the
radiation that falls upon them (most is reflected). Black and very dark objects
are good emitters
they also absorb nearly all the radiation that falls on
themâ€”which is why light-colored clothing is usually preferable to dark clothing
on a hot day. Thus, a good absorber is also a good emitter.
Any object not only emits energy by radiation but also absorbs energy radiated
by other objects. If an object of emissivity 
and area A is at a temperature 
it
radiates energy at a rate 
If the object is surrounded by an environment 
at temperature 
the rate at which the surroundings radiate energy is propor-
tional to 
then the rate that energy is absorbed by the object is proportional 
to 
The net rate of radiant heat flow from the object is given by the equation
(14;7)
where A is the surface area of the object,
its temperature and 
its emissivity
(at temperature
