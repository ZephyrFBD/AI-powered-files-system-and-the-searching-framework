 haploid cells called spores. Although haploid
like the “parents,” these spores contain a new genetic combination from two parents. The spores can remain dormant for
various time periods. Eventually, when conditions are conducive, the spores form multicellular haploid structures by many
rounds of mitosis (Figure 11.9).

Figure 11.9 Fungi, such as black bread mold (Rhizopus nigricans), have haploid-dominant life cycles. The haploid
multicellular stage produces specialized haploid cells by mitosis that fuse to form a diploid zygote. The zygote
undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores. Each spore gives rise to a multicellular haploid organism by
mitosis. (credit “zygomycota” micrograph: modification of work by “Fanaberka”/Wikimedia Commons)
If a mutation occurs so that a fungus is no longer able to produce a minus mating type, will it still be able to reproduce?
a.
No, sexual mode of reproduction is the only mode of reproduction in fungi.
