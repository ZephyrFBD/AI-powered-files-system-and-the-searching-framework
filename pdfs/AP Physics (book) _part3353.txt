he nuclear force is a short-range force: it acts only
between neighboring nucleons. But the electric force acts all the way across a
large nucleus. For very large nuclei, the large Z means the repulsive electric force
becomes so large (Coulomb’s law) that the strong nuclear force is unable to hold
the nucleus together.

We can express the instability of the parent nucleus in terms of energy (or
mass): the
