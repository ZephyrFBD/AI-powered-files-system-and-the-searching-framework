first to propose a theory explaining the variety of life on Earth. One of the most widely accepted
theories of evolution in Darwin’s day was that proposed by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck.
In the 18th century, Lamarck had proposed that acquired traits were inherited and passed on to offspring. For
example, in the case of Lamarck’s giraffes, Lamarck’s theory said that the giraffes had long necks because they were
constantly reaching for higher leaves while feeding. This theory is referred to as the “law of use and disuse,” or, as
we might say now, “use it or lose it.” According to Lamarck, giraffes have long necks because they constantly use
them.
We know now that Lamarck’s theory was wrong: acquired changes—that is, changes at a “macro” level in an
organism’s regular (somatic) body cells—will not appear in gamete cells. For example, if you were to lose one of
your fingers, your children would not inherit this trait. The gametes that your body makes include copies of your
regular old genome,
