n and differentiation, B cells can also
function as APCs.
After phagocytosis by APCs, the phagocytic vesicle fuses with an intracellular lysosome forming phagolysosome. Within
the phagolysosome, the components are broken down into fragments; the fragments are then loaded onto MHC class I or
MHC class II molecules and are transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation, as illustrated in Figure 33.8. Note
that T lymphocytes cannot properly respond to the antigen unless it is processed and embedded in an MHC II molecule.
APCs express MHC on their surfaces, and when combined with a foreign antigen, these complexes signal a “non-self”
invader. Once the fragment of antigen is embedded in the MHC II molecule, the immune cell can respond. Helper T- cells
are one of the main lymphocytes that respond to antigen-presenting cells. Recall that all other nucleated cells of the body
expressed MHC I molecules, which signal “healthy” or “normal.”
