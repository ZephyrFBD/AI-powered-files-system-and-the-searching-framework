horter the wavelength, the
finer the detail that can be obtained. This is one reason why particle accelerators
of higher and higher energy have been built in recent years: to probe ever deeper
into the structure of matter, to smaller and smaller size.
High resolution with electrons. What is the wavelength,
and hence the expected resolution, for 1.3-GeV electrons?
APPROACH Because 1.3 GeV is much larger than the electron mass, we must
be dealing with relativistic speeds. The momentum of the electrons is found from
Eq. 26–9, and the wavelength is
SOLUTION Each electron has 
which is about
2500 times the rest energy of the electron 
Thus we can
ignore the term 
in Eq. 26–9,
and we solve for p:
Therefore the de Broglie wavelength is
where
Hence
or 0.96 fm. This resolution of about 1 fm is on the order of the size of nuclei (see
Eq. 30–1).
NOTE The maximum possible resolution of this beam of electrons is far greater
than for a light beam in a light microscope
