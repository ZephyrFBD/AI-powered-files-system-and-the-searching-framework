After a discussion of nuclear chemistry (Chapter 21), 
the book ends with three survey chapters. Chapter 22 deals 
with nonmetals, Chapter 23 with the chemistry of transition 
metals, including coordination compounds, and Chapter 24 
with the chemistry of organic compounds and elementary 
biochemical themes. These final four chapters are developed 
in an independent, modular fashion and can be covered in any 
order.
Our chapter sequence provides a fairly standard organiza-
tion, but we recognize that not everyone teaches all the topics 
in the order we have chosen. We have therefore made sure that 
instructors can make common changes in teaching sequence 
with no loss in student comprehension. In particular, many 
instructors prefer to introduce gases (Chapter 10) after stoi-
chiometry (Chapter 3) rather than with states of matter. The 
chapter on gases has been written to permit this change with 
no disruption in the flow of material. It is also possible to treat
