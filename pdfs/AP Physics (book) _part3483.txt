ell. All forms of radiation can ionize atoms by
knocking out electrons. If these are bonding electrons, the molecule may break
apart, or its structure may be altered so that it does not perform its normal function
or may perform a harmful function. In the case of proteins, the loss of one molecule
is not serious if there are other copies of the protein in the cell and additional copies
can be made from the gene that codes for it. However, large doses of radiation may
damage so many molecules that new copies cannot be made quickly enough, and
the cell dies.
Damage to the DNA is more serious, since a cell may have only one copy.
Each alteration in the DNA can affect a gene and alter the molecule that gene
codes for (Section 29â€“3), so that needed proteins or other molecules may not be
made at all. Again the cell may die. The death of a single cell is not normally a
problem, since the body can replace it with a new one. (There are exceptions,
such as neurons, which are mostly not replaceab
