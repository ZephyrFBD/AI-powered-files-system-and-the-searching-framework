medical and science authorities (all subordinates to the Cult-owned
communist government) took genetic material from the lungs of
only a few of the ﬁrst patients. The material contained their own
cells, bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms living in their bodies.
The only way you could prove the existence of the ‘virus’ and its
responsibility for the alleged ‘Covid-19’ was to isolate the virus from
all the other material – a process also known as ‘puriﬁcation’ – and
then follow the postulates sequence developed in the late 19th

2. The microorganism must be isolated from the host with the dise
