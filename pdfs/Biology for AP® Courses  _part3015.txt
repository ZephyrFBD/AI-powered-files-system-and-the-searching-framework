ike projection shape.
Which of the following is an example of how the shape of
microvilli can enhance nutrient absorption?
a.
Nutrients can enter the bloodstream through the
blood vessels that are located in middle of the
microvilli.
b.
Larger microvilli have more surface area over
which more nutrients are absorbed.
c.
The microvilli projections aid in mechanical
digestion of food particles.
d.
The finger-like projections prevent large
particles of food from passing through the
digestive system.
58. Microvilli greatly increase the efficiency of nutrient
uptake in the small intestines. How do the size and shape
of microvilli promote this efficiency?
a.
They have a greater surface area-to-volume ratio
than larger cells. The finger-like projection
shape provides more surface area over the small
intestines from which they absorb nutrients and
contains blood vessels so nutrients passing
through them can enter the bloodstream readily.
b.
They have a greater surface area-to-volume ratio
than
