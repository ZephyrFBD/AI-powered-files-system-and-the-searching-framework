 it in the periodic table. Thus, in each pair the halogen 
having the smaller atomic number ends up as the halide ion. 
If the halogen with the smaller atomic number is already the 
halide ion, there is no reaction. Thus, the key to determining 
whether a reaction occurs is locating the elements in the peri-
odic table.
Solve
(a) Br2 can oxidize (remove electrons from) the anions of the 
halogens below it in the periodic table. Thus, it oxidizes I -:
2 I -1aq2 + Br21aq2 ¡ I21s2 + 2 Br -1aq2
(b) Cl -  is the anion of a halogen above iodine in the periodic 
table. Thus, I2 cannot oxidize Cl -; there is no reaction.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which is (are) able to oxidize Cl -?
(a) F2 
(b) F -  
(c) Both Br2 and I2 
(d) Both Br -  and I -
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction 
between Br -1aq2 and Cl21aq2.
