found together in central New England. Which of 
the following best explains the observed 
distribution pattern of the snails? 
(A) The founder effect suggests that dark-colored 
snails migrated from the southern regions to 
the north and established the populations 
found there. 
(B) Genetic drift at the shell-color locus caused 
the northern population to become 
homozygous for the dark-color allele. 
(C) The mutation rate is higher in the south, as 
the longer days expose the snails to more 
ultraviolet radiation than in the north.  
(D) Dark-colored snails absorb more solar energy 
and so survive more readily in the colder 
northern waters.
