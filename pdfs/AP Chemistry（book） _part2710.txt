Blood, the ﬂuid that transports oxygen to all parts of the body, is one 
of the most prominent examples of the importance of buffers in liv-
ing beings.
Human blood has a normal pH of 7.35 to 7.45. Any deviation 
from this range can have extremely disruptive effects on the stabil-
ity of cell membranes, the structures of proteins, and the activities 
of enzymes. Death may result if the blood pH falls below 6.8 or rises 
above 7.8. When the pH falls below 7.35, the condition is called acido-
sis; when it rises above 7.45, the condition is called alkalosis. Acidosis 
is the more common tendency because metabolism generates several 
acids in the body.
The major buffer system used to control blood pH is the carbonic 
acid–bicarbonate buffer system. Carbonic acid 1H2CO32 and bicarbon-
ate ion 1HCO3
-2 are a conjugate acid–base pair. In addition, carbonic 
acid decomposes into carbon dioxide gas and water. The important 
equilibria in this buffer system are
H+1aq2 + HCO3
-1aq2 ∆  H2CO3
