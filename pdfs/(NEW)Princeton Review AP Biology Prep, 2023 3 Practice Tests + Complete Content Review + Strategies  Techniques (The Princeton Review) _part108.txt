ts in 200 mL of water and mixed 1 mL of the resulting
enzyme solution with 2 mL of milk at different temperatures. After 20 minutes, the scientists tested for the
presence of glucose using test strips. The glucose test strips are yellow in the absence of glucose and turn
increasingly darker shades of green when glucose is present. The results are shown in Figure 1.

Questions & Methods questions ask you to determine the methods best suited for an experiment. You may be asked
to develop a testable question to prove or disprove an idea and/or develop hypotheses for an experiment. You may
also be asked to identify experimental design components for experiments, such as independent and dependent
variables and contro
