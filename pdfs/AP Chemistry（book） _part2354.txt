[14.118] The reaction between ethyl iodide and hydroxide ion in 
ethanol 1C2H5OH2 solution, C2H5I1alc2 + OH -1alc2 ¡
C2H5OH1l2 + I -1alc2, has an activation energy of 
86.8 kJ>mol and a frequency factor of 2.10 * 1011 M -1 s-1. 
(a) Predict the rate constant for the reaction at 35 °C. (b) A 
solution of KOH in ethanol is made up by dissolving 0.335 
g KOH in ethanol to form 250.0 mL of solution. Similar-
ly, 1.453 g of C2H5I is dissolved in ethanol to form 250.0 
mL of solution. Equal volumes of the two solutions are 
mixed. Assuming the reaction is ﬁrst order in each reac-
tant, what is the initial rate at 35 °C? (c) Which reagent in 
the reaction is limiting, assuming the reaction proceeds to 
completion? (d) Assuming the frequency factor and acti-
vation energy do not change as a function of temper
