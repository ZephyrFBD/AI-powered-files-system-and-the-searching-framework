H(aq). Based on these properties, is bismuth char-
acterized as a metallic, metalloid, or nonmetallic element? 
 
(d) Treating bismuth with ﬂuorine gas forms BiF5. Use the 
electron conﬁguration of Bi to explain the formation of a com-
pound with this formulation. (e) While it is possible to form 
BiF5 in the manner just described, pentahalides of bismuth are 
not known for the other halogens. Explain why the pentaha-
lide might form with ﬂuorine but not with the other halogens. 
How does the behavior of bismuth relate to the fact that xenon 
reacts with ﬂuorine to form compounds but not with the other 
halogens?
 7.115  Potassium superoxide, KO2, is often used in oxygen masks 
(such as those used by ﬁreﬁghters) because KO2 reacts with 
CO2 to release molecular oxygen. Experiments indicate that 2 
mol of KO21s2 react with each mole of CO21g2. (a) The products 
of the reaction are K2CO31s2 and O21g2. Write a balanced equa-
tion for the reaction between KO21s2 and CO21g2. (b) Indicate
