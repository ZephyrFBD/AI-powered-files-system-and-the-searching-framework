incorrect.
5. (B) The products of the light-dependent reactions are ATP, NADPH, and oxygen gas. Choices (A) and (C) are
incorrect because ADP and NADP+ are consumed, not produced, in the light-dependent reactions. G3P is a
product of the light-independent reactions, which further rules out choice (C) and eliminates choice (D).
6. (C) The products of the Calvin cycle are ADP, NADP+, and G3P. Choice (A) is incorrect because oxygen is not
produced by the Calvin cycle. Choice (B) is incorrect because ATP and NADPH are consumed, not produced,
by the Calvin cycle, and oxygen is not produced by the Calvin cycle. Choice (D) is incorrect because while G3P
is produced by the Calvin cycle, ATP and NADPH are consumed, not produced, by the Calvin cycle.
7. (D) This statement correctly identifies the locations of the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent
reactions of photosynthesis. Choice (A) is incorrect because the correct location of the light-dependent reactions
is the thylakoid a
