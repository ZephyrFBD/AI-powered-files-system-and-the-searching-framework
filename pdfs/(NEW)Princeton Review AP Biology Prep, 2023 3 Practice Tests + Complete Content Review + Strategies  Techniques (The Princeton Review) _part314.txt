ill have
a different mix of alleles than it began with. Remember, the two homologous chromosomes are versions that came
from the person’s mother and father. So, a chromosome that has experienced crossing-over will now be a mix of
alleles from the mother and father versions.
Metaphase I
As in mitosis, the chromosome pairs—now called tetrads—line up at the metaphase plate. By contrast, you’ll recall
that in regular metaphase, the chromosomes line up individually. One important concept to note is that the alignment
during metaphase is random, so the copy of each chromosome that ends up in a daughter cell is random. Therefore,
the gamete will be created with a mixture of genetic information from the person’s father and mother. This means
that the offspring created would be a combination of all four grandparents.
Anaphase I
During anaphase I, each pair of chromatids within a tetrad moves to opposite poles. Notice that the chromatids do
not separate at the centromere. The homologs separate w
