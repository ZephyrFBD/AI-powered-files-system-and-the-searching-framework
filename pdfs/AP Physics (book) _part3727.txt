CHAPTER 33
Astrophysics and Cosmology
†For light there is no medium and we can make no distinction between motion of the source and
motion of the observer (special relativity), as we did for sound which travels in a medium.

emit and absorb light of particular
frequencies depending on the spacing 
of their energy levels, as we saw in
Chapters 27 to 29. (a) The spectrum
of light received from a relatively
slow-moving galaxy. (b) Spectrum of a
galaxy moving away from us at a much
higher speed. Note how the peaks (or
lines) in the spectrum have moved to
longer wavelengths. The redshift is
z = Alobs - lrestBlrest.
