APPROACH Before we can write down an equation applying conservation of
energy, we must first check to see if the final state will be all ice, a mixture of ice
and water at 0°C, or all water. To bring the 3.0 kg of water at 20°C down to 0°C
would require an energy release of
On the other hand, to raise the ice from 
to 0°C would require
and to change the ice to water at 0°C would require
The sum of the last two quantities is 
This is not
enough energy to bring the 3.0 kg of water at 20°C down to 0°C, so we see that
the mixture must end up all water, somewhere between 0°C and 20°C.
10.5 kJ + 167 kJ = 177 kJ.
