66. Two protons, each having a speed of 0.990c in the labora-
tory, are moving toward each other. Determine (a) the
momentum of each proton in the laboratory, (b) the total
momentum of the two protons in the laboratory, and 
(c) the momentum of one proton as seen by the other proton.
67. When two moles of hydrogen molecules 
and one mole
of oxygen molecules 
react to form two moles of water
the energy released is 484 kJ. How much does the
mass decrease in this reaction? What % of the total original
mass is this?
68. The fictional starship Enterprise obtains its power by
combining matter and antimatter, achieving complete
conversion of mass into energy. If the mass of the
Enterprise is approximately 
how much mass
must be converted into kinetic energy to accelerate it from
rest to one-tenth the speed of light?
69. Make a graph of the kinetic energy versus momentum for
(a) a particle of nonzero mass, and (b) a par
