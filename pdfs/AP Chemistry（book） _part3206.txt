▲ Figure 20.11 Relative strengths of oxidizing and reducing agents.
Using Table 20.1, rank the following ions in the order of increasing strength as oxidizing agents: NO3
-1aq2, Ag+1aq2, Cr2O7
2-1aq2.
Solve 
From Table 20.1, we have:
Analyze We are asked to rank the abilities of several ions to act as 
oxidizing agents.
Plan The more readily an ion is reduced (the more positive its E °
red 
value), the stronger it is as an oxidizing agent.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Based on the data in Table 20.1, which of the following spe-
cies would you expect to be the strongest oxidizing agent?
