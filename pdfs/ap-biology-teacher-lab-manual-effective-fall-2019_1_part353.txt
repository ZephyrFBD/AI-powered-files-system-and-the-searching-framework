Note that the shape of this curve is not the expected curve that rises and levels off. This 
is because the times to float are the inverse of the rate of photosynthesis. Taking the 
reciprocal of ET50, 1/ ET50 allows the graphic presentation to more closely express the 
physical phenomenon, as shown in Figure 3.

This procedure is particularly useful for comparing photosynthetic rates between C4 
and C3 plants. This procedure is also very useful for exploring the connection between 
photosynthesis and cellular respiration. O
