h level of estrogen causes FSH and especially LH to rise
rapidly, then fall. The spike in LH causes ovulation: the most mature follicle, like that shown in Figure 34.18, ruptures and

releases its egg. The follicles that did not rupture degenerate and their eggs are lost. The level of estrogen decreases when
the extra follicles degenerate.

Following ovulation, the ovarian cycle enters its luteal phase, illustrated in Figure 34.17 and the menstrual cycle enters its
secretory phase, both of which run from about day 15 to 28. The luteal and secretory phases refer to changes in the ruptured
follicle. The cells in the follicle undergo physical changes and produce a structure called a corpus luteum. The corpus
luteum produces estrogen and progesterone. The progesterone facilitates the regrowth of the uterine lining and inhibits
