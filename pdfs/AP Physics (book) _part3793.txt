s a second star,
will the parallax angle of the farther star be greater or less
than that of the nearer star? By what factor?
4. (II) What is the relative brightness of the Sun as seen from
Jupiter, as compared to its brightness from Earth? (Jupiter
is 5.2 times farther from the Sun than the Earth is.)
5. (II) When our Sun becomes a red giant, what will be its
average density if it expands out to the orbit of Mercury 
(
from the Sun)?
6. (II) We saw earlier (Chapter 14) that the rate energy
reaches the Earth from the Sun (the “solar constant”) is
about 
What is (a) the apparent bright-
ness b of the Sun, and (b) the intrinsic luminosity L of the
Sun?
7. (II) Estimate the angular width that our Galaxy would
subtend if observed from the nearest galaxy to us
(Table 33–1). Compare to the angular width of the Moon
from Earth.
8. (II) Assuming our Galaxy represents a good average for
all other galaxies, how many stars are in the observable
universe?
9. (II) Calculate the density of a white d
