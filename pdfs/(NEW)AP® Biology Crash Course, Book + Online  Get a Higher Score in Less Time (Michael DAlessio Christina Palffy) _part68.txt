transmitters in the nervous system, histamine in the immune system,
growth factors in development, and prostaglandins in the immune and reproductive systems.
ii. Local regulators act quickly and do not enter the bloodstream.
2. Hormones act over long distances because they enter the circulatory system and are transported
around the body. Examples include insulin, testosterone, and estrogen, which are all regulated by the
endocrine system.
B. When a hormone comes in contact with a target cell, it either enters the cell or binds to receptors on the
surface of the cell.
1. Most chemical messengers, including most protein-based hormones, bind to proteins that act as
receptors on the plasma membrane of target cells.
i.
The binding between a hormone and a receptor causes a physical change (usually involving
movement) of the protein receptor, which sets in motion a message relay system inside the cell
called a signal transduction pathway.
ii. A series of secondary messengers carry the signal
