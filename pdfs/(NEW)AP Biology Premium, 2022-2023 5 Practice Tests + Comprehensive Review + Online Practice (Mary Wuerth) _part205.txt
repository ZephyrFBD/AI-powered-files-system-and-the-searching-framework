ide the sea slug with food.
(c) Reducing the intensity of light in Elysia crispata’s habitat would have a negative impact on Elysia
crispata’s survival.
(d) Photosynthesis requires light energy, so reducing the light intensity would reduce the amount of
photosynthesis the chloroplasts would perform and the amount of food from those chloroplasts that would
be available to Elysia crispata. The sea slug might become more dependent on consuming other food
sources.
12. (a)
(b)
(c) Rubisco is an enzyme that is used in the light-independent reactions (the Calvin cycle) of photosynthesis, so
the light-independent reactions would be most directly affected by an inhibitor of Rubisco.
(d) The light-independent reactions of photosynthesis require ATP and NADPH that are produced by the light-
dependent reactions of photosynthesis. If a plant was kept in the dark for a long period of time, the light-
dependent reactions would stop and the ATP and NADPH that are required for the light-independent
rea
