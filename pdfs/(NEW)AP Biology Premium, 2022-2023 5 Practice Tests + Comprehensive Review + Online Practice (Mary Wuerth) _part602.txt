axis of a graph, and the sizes of these known DNA marker fragments are plotted on
the y-axis. A line of best fit is drawn between these points to create a standard curve (as shown by the solid line in
Figure 24.11). Using the standard curve shown in Figure 24.11, if a fragment of unknown size migrated 4.0 cm in
the gel, then interpolated to the line of best fit, the size of the fragment can be estimated from the standard curve to
be about 420 base pairs (shown by the dotted line in Figure 24.11).

Lab 10: Energy Dynamics
All life on Earth obtains its energy either directly or indirectly from light energy. Photosynthetic organisms
(producers) capture light energy and store it in the chemical bonds of the organic products of photosynthesis. The
total amount of organic compounds created by an organism through the process of photosynthesis is called the gross
primary productivity. Some of the orga
