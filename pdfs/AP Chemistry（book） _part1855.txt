The chemical bonding in metals is reflected in their properties. You have probably 
held a length of copper wire or an iron bolt. Perhaps you have even seen the surface of a 
freshly cut piece of sodium metal. These substances, though distinct from one another, 
share certain similarities that enable us to classify them as metallic. A clean metal surface 
has a characteristic luster. Metals have a characteristic cold feeling when you touch them, 
related to their high thermal conductivity (ability to conduct heat). Metals also have 
high electrical conductivity, which means that electrically charged particles flow easily 
through them. The thermal conductivity of a metal usually parallels its electrical conduc-
tivity. Silver and copper, for example, which possess the highest electrical conductivities 
among the elements, also possess the highest thermal conductivities.
Most metals are malleable, which means that they can be hammered
