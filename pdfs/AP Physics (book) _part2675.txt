’s atmosphere. A careful analysis of all the Sun’s thousands of absorption
lines reveals that at least two-thirds of all elements are present in the Sun’s
atmosphere. The presence of elements in the atmosphere of nearby planets, in
interstellar space, and in stars, is also determined by spectroscopy.
Spectroscopy is useful for determining the presence of certain types of 
molecules in laboratory specimens where chemical analysis would be difficult. For
example, biological DNA and different types of protein absorb light in particular
regions of the spectrum (such as in the UV). The material to be examined, which
is often in solution, is placed in a monochromatic light beam whose wavelength is
selected by the placement angle of a diffraction grating or prism. The amount of
absorption, as compared to a standard solution without the specimen, can reveal
not only the presence of a particular type of molecule, but also its concentration.
Light emission and absorption also occur outside the v
