erval between the two events (the sending of the light, and its reception on the
spaceship) is greater for the observer on Earth than for the observer on the space-
ship. This is a general result of the theory of relativity, and is known as time dilation.
The time dilation effect can be stated as
clocks moving relative to an observer are measured to run more slowly, as
compared to clocks at rest.
However, we should not think that the clocks are somehow at fault.
Time is actually measured to pass more slowly in any moving reference frame
as compared to your own.
This remarkable result is an inevitable outcome of the two postulates of the special
theory of relativity.
