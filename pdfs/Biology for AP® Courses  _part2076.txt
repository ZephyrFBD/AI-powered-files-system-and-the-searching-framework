ns have actively modified plants
and animals by selecting and breeding
individuals with traits deemed desirable. In
natural selection, individuals are selected
naturally as its traits deem it more fit for survival
and reproduction
51. Genes important in the embryonic development of
animals have been relatively well conserved during
evolution. This means they are more similar among
different species than many other genes. What explains
this genetic conservation across animal species?
a.
Changes in the genes that are important to
embryonic development have been relatively
minor because there are no selective pressures
on an individual before it is born
b.
Changes in the genes that are important to
embryonic development have been relatively
minor because not much time has elapsed since
the divergence of the various animal taxa.
c.
Changes in the genes that are important to
embryonic development have been relatively
minor because early embryos are very fragile
and even small mutations can
