sure of a vapor above a liquid stops changing when the rate at which molecules 
escaping from the liquid into the gas phase equals the rate at which molecules from the 
gas phase are captured by and reenter the liquid.
Just like evaporation and condensation, or dissolution and crystallization, chemical 
reactions can run in the forward and reverse directions.  If the reverse reaction is suffi-
ciently slow, we can neglect it altogether, as we have done in reactions we’ve encoun-
tered up to this point, but there are many important examples where we must consider 
the rates of both forward and reverse reactions.
Chemical equilibrium occurs when the forward and  
reverse reactions proceed at equal rates.
When a reaction is at equilibrium, the rate at which the products form from the reac-
tants equals the rate at which the reactants form from the products. As a result, concen-
trations cease to change, and the reaction appears to stop before it reaches completion.
