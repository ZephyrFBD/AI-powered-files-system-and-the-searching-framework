1.1 and 2.1)
atomic mass unit (amu) A unit based on the value of exactly 12 
amu for the mass of the isotope of carbon that has six protons 
and six neutrons in the nucleus; 1 amu = 1.66054 * 10−24 g. 
(Sections 2.3 and 2.4)
atomic number The number of protons in the nucleus of an 
atom of an element. (Section 2.3)
atomic radius An estimate of the size of an atom. See bonding 
atomic radius. (Section 7.3)
atomic weight The average mass of the atoms of an element in 
atomic mass units (amu); it is numerically equal to the mass in 
grams of one mole of the element. (Section 2.4)
autoionization The process whereby water spontaneously forms 
low concentrations of H+1aq2 and OH-1aq2 ions by proton transfer 
from one water molecule to another. (Section 16.3)
Avogadro’s hypothesis A statement that equal volumes of gases 
at the same temperature and pressure contain equal numbers of 
molecules. (Section 10.3)
Avogadro’s law A statement that the volume of a gas maintaine
