 2 both undergo a change of phase by cycle
when they reflect from the coating’s front and rear surfaces, respectively (at
both surfaces the index of refraction increases). Thus there is no net change in
phase due to the reflections. The net phase difference will be due to the extra
path 
taken by ray 2 in the coating, where 
We want 
to equal 
so that destructive interference occurs, where

in the coating. With

NOTE We could have set
where m is an integer. The smallest
thickness 
is usually chosen because destructive interference will occur
over the widest angle.
NOTE Complete destructive interference occurs only for the given wavelength of
visible light. Longer and shorter wavelengths will have only partial cancellation.
24–9 Michelson Interferometer
A useful instrument involving wave interference is the Michelson interferometer
(Fig. 24–37),† invented by the American Albert A. Michelson (Section 22–4).
