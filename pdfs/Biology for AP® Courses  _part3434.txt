72. Many hormones repress or enhance protein expression
by binding to transcription factors called nuclear receptors.
Other hormones regulate processes by binding to cell
surface receptors that induce cell signaling cascades.
A. Represent these two different processes for cell-cell
communication by creating a flow chart showing the
direction of information in a process regulating
homeostasis such as the control of blood sugar or water
loss. Annotate your diagram to describe the key elements
of each step in the particular example that you choose.
B. Justify the claim that a developmental process is more
likely to involve nuclear receptors, while regulation of
metabolism is more likely to involve cell surface
receptors.
The lancelet is a chordate, fish-like filter feeder that buries
itself in marine sands. Their ancestors and vertebrates
diverged approximately 500 million years ago. Lancelet
and human are members of a superphylum of animals with
bilateral symmetry, Deuterostomia. In o
