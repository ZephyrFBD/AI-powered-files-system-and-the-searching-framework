d 5' (1' is read
as “one prime”). The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5' carbon of one sugar of one nucleotide
and the hydroxyl group of the 3' carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, thereby forming a 5'-3' phosphodiester bond.
In the 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked together to determine the structure of DNA at the University of
Cambridge, England. Other scientists like Linus Pauling and Maurice Wilkins were also actively exploring this field.
Pauling had discovered the secondary structure of proteins using X-ray crystallography. In Wilkins’ lab, researcher Rosalind
Franklin was using X-ray diffraction methods to understand the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick were able to piece
together the puzzle of the DNA molecule on the basis of Franklin's data because Crick had also studied X-ray diffraction
(Figure 14.6). In 1962, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.
Unfortunately, by then Frankl
