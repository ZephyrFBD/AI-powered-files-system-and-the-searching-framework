 send us straight to 
 
 hell where we’ll never have to worry about the cold again. 
 
 And he smiles. 
 
 Two weeks before Christmas Malachy and I come home from 
 
 school in a heavy rain and when we push in the door we find the 
 
 kitchen empty.The table and chairs and trunk are gone and the fire is 
 
 dead in the grate. The Pope is still there and that means we haven’t 
 
 moved again. Dad would never move without the Pope. The kitchen 
 
 floor is wet, little pools of water all around, and the walls are twinkling 
 
 with the damp.There’s a noise upstairs and when we go up we find Dad 
 
 and Mam and the missing furniture. It’s nice and warm there with a fire 
 
 blazing in the grate, Mam sitting in the bed, and Dad reading The Irish 
 
 Press and smoking a cigarette by the fire. Mam tells us there was a terrible 
 
 flood, that the rain came down the lane and poured in under our 
 
 door.They tried to stop it with rags but they only turned sopping wet 
 
 and let the rain in. P
