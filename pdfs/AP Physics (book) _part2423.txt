sistance of 
It is initially in a 0.665-T magnetic field, with its plane per-
pendicular to 
but is removed from the field in 40.0 ms.
Calculate the electric energy dissipated in this process.
76. A high-intensity desk lamp is rated at 45 W but requires
only 12 V. It contains a transformer that converts 120-V
household voltage. (a) Is the transformer step-up or step-
down? (b) What is the current in the secondary coil when
the lamp is on? (c) What is the current in the primary coil?
(d) What is the resistance of the bulb when on?
77. A flashlight can be made that is powered by the induced
current from a magnet moving through a coil of wire. The
coil and magnet are inside a plastic tube that can be shaken
causing the magnet to move back and forth through the
coil. Assume the magnet has a maximum field strength of
0.05 T. Make reasonable assumptions and specify the size
of the coil and the number of turns necessary to light a
standard 1-watt, 3-V flashlight bulb.
