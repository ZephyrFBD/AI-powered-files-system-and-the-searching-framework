nsgenic mouse has the HTT gene. A scientist wants to investigate whether inserting a stop codon into the
HTT gene might prevent the mouse from developing the disease. Which of the following tools would be most
useful in inserting a stop codon into the HTT gene?
(A) CRISPR-Cas9
(B) gel electrophoresis
(C) polymerase chain reaction
(D) restriction enzymes
9. What property of DNA causes it to move toward the positive electrode in gel electrophoresis?
(A) the nitrogen atoms in the nitrogenous bases
(B) the hydrogen bonds that form between the bases in the two strands of the double helix
(C) the charges on the oxygen atoms in the deoxyribose sugars
(D) the charges on the phosphates in the backbone of the helix
10. Why is a heat-stable DNA polymerase required for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)?
(A) Heat-stable DNA polymerases add DNA nucleotides at a faster rate than other DNA polymerases.
(B) The high temperatures that are required for each cycle of PCR to separate the DNA strands woul
