CHAPTER SUMMARY
14.1 Historical Basis of Modern Understanding
DNA was first isolated from white blood cells by Friedrich Miescher, who called it nuclein because it was isolated from
nuclei. Frederick Griffith's experiments with strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae provided the first hint that DNA may be
the transforming principle. Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty proved that DNA is required for the transformation of bacteria.
Later experiments by Hershey and Chase using bacteriophage T2 proved that DNA is the genetic material. Chargaff found
that the ratio of A = T and C = G, and that the percen
