e ecosystems. The
movement of phosphate from the ocean to the land and through the soil is extremely slow, with the average phosphate ion
having an oceanic residence time between 20,000 and 100,000 years.
Figure 37.19 In nature, phosphorus exists as the phosphate ion (PO43âˆ’). Weathering of rocks and volcanic activity
releases phosphate into the soil, water, and air, where it becomes available to terrestrial food webs. Phosphate enters
the oceans via surface runoff, groundwater flow, and river flow. Phosphate dissolved in ocean water cycles into marine
food webs. Some phosphate from the marine food webs falls to the ocean floor, where it forms sediment. (credit:

Excess phosphorus and nitrogen that enters these ecosystems from fertilizer runoff and from sewage causes excessive
growth of microorganisms and depletes the dissolved oxygen, which leads to the death of many ecosystem fauna, such as
shellfish and finfish. This proc
