icate their DNA in the
nucleus of the cell and use the host cell’s RNA polymerases to make their
proteins. There are a few exceptions to this (e.g., the pox family of viruses
that causes smallpox, chicken pox, etc.) that cannot enter the nucleus
and actually carry the necessary RNA polymerase with them. RNA viruses
replicate in the cytoplasm, sometimes using their RNA as mRNA directly,
and sometimes using their RNA as a template for mRNA synthesis. One
group of RNA viruses, the retroviruses (e.g., HIV), converts its RNA into
DNA first, using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The DNA copy is then
transcribed into mRNA by the host’s RNA polymerases. Many of the viral
proteins that are first synthesized on the host’s ribosomes are the ones
needed for replication of the genome.
Replication of the genome: All virus particles will first replicate the DNA or
RNA they came into the host cell with; the complementary copy that is
created is then used as a template for all new copies of the genom
