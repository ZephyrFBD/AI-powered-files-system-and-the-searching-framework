cut with the same restriction enzymes? Will the RFLP patterns 
produced by gel electrophoresis produced by DNA mapping be the same or different 
if you use just one restriction enzyme? Do you have to use many restriction enzymes 
to find differences between individuals? Justify your prediction. 
•  Can you make a prediction about the RFLP patterns of identical twins cut with 
the same restriction enzymes? How about the RFLP patterns of fraternal twins or 
triplets? 
Now that you understand the basic idea of genetic mapping by using restriction  
enzymes, let’s explore how DNA fragments can be used to make a genetic profile.  
■ Activity III: Basic Principles of Gel Electrophoresis 
Creating DNA profiles depends on gel electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis separates 
charged molecules, including nucleic acids and amino acids, by how fast they migrate 
through a porous gel under the influence of an electrical current. Your teacher will likely 
prepare the gel ahead of time by dissolving a
