pressure 
(force per unit area, Section 10.2) produced by these collisions de-
pend both on how strongly the molecules strike the walls (impulse 
imparted per collision) and on the rate at which the collisions occur:
 
P ∝impulse imparted per collision * collision rate 
For a molecule traveling at the rms speed, the impulse imparted 
by a collision with a wall depends on the momentum of the mole-
cule; that is, it depends on the product of the molecule’s mass and 
speed: murms. The collision rate is proportional to the number of 
molecules per unit volume, n>V, and to their speed, which is urms 
because we are talking about only molecules traveling at this speed. 
Thus, we have
 
P ∝murms * n
V * urms ∝

Because the average kinetic energy, 1
2 m1urms22, is proportional 
to temperature, we have m1urms22 ∝T. Making this substitution in 
Equation 10.17 gives
 
P ∝

If we put in a proportionality constant, calling it R, the gas con-
stant, yo
