ransformed. The number of 
bacteria that take up a plasmid successfully is called the “transformation efficiency.” This 
is one of the values you will calculate in this lab unit. 
In this investigation, you will use a predefined procedure to transform E. coli bacteria 
with a plasmid carrying a foreign gene. There are several different plasmids your 
instructor can choose from; you will be instructed about which one to work with for this 
unit. 
E. coli is an ideal organism for the molecular geneticist to manipulate because it 
naturally inhabits the human colon and easily can be grown in a nutrient medium such 
as LB broth. 
 
But what is E. coli’s natural or pre-transformation phenotype? 
•  Observe the colonies of E. coli grown on the starter LB/agar plate provided by 
your teacher to glean some information before you determine if any genetic 
transformation has occurred. What traits do you observe in pre-transformed 
bacteria? Record your observations in your laboratory notebook.
