ouching and adjacent
chromatids switch places. The chromatid on the extreme left side
remains A, d, and G. After the crossover, the inner chromatid on the
left side becomes A, d, and g. The next chromatid (moving right)
becomes a, D, and G, while the last chromatid on the right remains
unchanged as a, D, and g. This question tests your understanding of
the importance of meiosis and crossing-over in producing great
genetic variation in gametes and offspring and increased genetic
variation for evolution. (IST-1)
(B) This choice is an important fact about the G1 restriction point. If
a cell passes G1, it will divide. If it does NOT pass this point, the
cell will enter G0 and stop dividing. (ENE-3)
(A) Cancer cells do not exhibit the trait of density-dependent
inhibition, which is described in choice A. Although cancer cells
commonly have more than the diploid number of chromosomes,
they contain only one nucleus. Cancer cells are not arrested in G0.
On the contrary, they constantly replica
