lf Stream, and ocean currents. If you were to hike up a mountain, the changes you would
see in the vegetation would parallel those as you move to higher latitudes.
Ecologists who study biogeography examine patterns of species distribution. No species exists everywhere; for example,
the Venus flytrap is endemic to a small area in North and South Carolina. An endemic species is one which is naturally
found only in a specific geographic area that is usually restricted in size. Other species are generalists: species which live in
a wide variety of geographic areas; the raccoon, for example, is native to most of North and Central America.
Species distribution patterns are based on biotic and abiotic factors and their influences during the very long periods of time
required for species evolution; therefore, early studies of biogeography were closely linked to the emergence of evolutionary
thinking in the eighteenth century. Some of the most distinctive assemblages of plants and animals occur
