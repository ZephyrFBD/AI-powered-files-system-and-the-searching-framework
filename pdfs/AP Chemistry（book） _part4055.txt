the boiling point. 11.83 (a) Evaporation is an endothermic process. 
The heat required to vaporize sweat is absorbed from your body, help-
ing to keep it cool. (b) The vacuum pump reduces the pressure of the 
atmosphere above the water until atmospheric pressure equals the 
vapor pressure of water and the water boils. Boiling is an endother-
mic process, and the temperature drops if the system is not able to 
absorb heat from the surroundings fast enough. As the temperature 
of the water decreases, the water freezes. 11.88 At low Antarctic tem-
peratures, molecules in the liquid crystalline phase have less kinetic 
energy due to temperature, and the applied voltage may not be suf-
Ô¨Åcient to overcome orienting forces among the ends of molecules. If 
of increasing boiling points is the order of increasing polarizability
