a series of experiments
using choice chambers to investigate behaviors that underlie directed movement (taxis) towards or away
from environmental stimuli, including chemical signals, light, and temperature, in a small population of
Drosophila.
Activity
Animal Behavior Field Study
Animal behavior can be studied in nearly every environment. Visit a local park, zoo, athletic field, or even
a location on your school campus and observe the behaviors and interactions among different animals
and with their environment. Consider the following questions in your study: How do animals exchange
information and alter behavior in response to stimuli? What mechanisms do animals use to communicate
information? What examples of innate and learned behaviors did you observe? What predictions can you
make about observed behavior(s) if environmental conditions change?
