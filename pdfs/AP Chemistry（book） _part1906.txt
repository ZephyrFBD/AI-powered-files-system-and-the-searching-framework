diamond—both of which are pure carbon—
arise from differences in their three-dimensional structure and bonding.
Semiconductors
Metals conduct electricity extremely well. Many solids, however, conduct electricity 
somewhat, but nowhere near as well as metals, which is why such materials are called 
semiconductors. Two examples of semiconductors are silicon and germanium, which 
lie immediately below carbon in the periodic table. Like carbon, each of these elements 
has four valence electrons, just the right number to satisfy the octet rule by forming sin-
gle covalent bonds with four neighbors. Hence, silicon and germanium, as well as the 
gray form of tin, crystallize with the same infinite network of covalent bonds as diamond.
When atomic s and p orbitals overlap, they form bonding molecular orbitals and 
antibonding molecular orbitals. Each pair of s orbitals overlaps to give one bonding and 
one antibonding molecular orbital, whereas the p orbitals overlap to give three bonding 
and
