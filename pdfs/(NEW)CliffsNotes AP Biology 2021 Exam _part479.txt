and egg, and seed development follow.
The AP exam does not require you to know the reproductive cycles of flowering plants or any other plants.

Gas Exchange in Plants
During photosynthesis, leaves take in CO2and release O2. Simultaneously, in all parts of the plant, cellular
respiration is taking place, consuming O2, releasing CO2, and generating ATP from the glucose produced by
photosynthesis. Gas exchange, the movement of O2and CO2between the
plant and the external environment, occurs as follows:
 
1. Stomata allow CO2 to diffuse into the leaf. Each stoma is surrounded
 
by two guard cells that control the opening of the stoma. When environmental conditions are suitable (not
excessively hot or dry), guard
 
cells open and allow CO2 to diffuse into the leaf.
 
2. CO2 diffuses into the water lining the leaf. CO2 enters the spaces in
 
the spongy mesophyll tissue and then diffuses into the water lining the
 
cells. Once
