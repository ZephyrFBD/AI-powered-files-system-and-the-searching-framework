estimate the accuracy (or uncertainty) of the answer. Suppose for example we
divide 97 by 92:
Both 97 and 92 have two significant figures, so the rule says to give the answer
as 1.1. Yet the numbers 97 and 92 both imply an uncertainty of 
if no other
uncertainty is stated. Both
and
imply an uncertainty of 
about 1%
But the final result to two significant figures 
is 1.1, with an implied uncertainty of 
which is an uncertainty of about 10%
It is better in this case to give the answer as 1.05 (which
is three significant figures). Why? Because 1.05 implies an uncertainty of 
which is
just like the uncertainty in the original
numbers 92 and 97.
SUGGESTION: Use the significant figures rule, but consider the % uncertainty
too, and add an extra digit if it gives a more realistic estimate of uncertainty.
Approximations
Much of physics involves approximations, often because we do not have the
means to solve a problem precisely. For example, we may choose to ignore air
resistance or friction
