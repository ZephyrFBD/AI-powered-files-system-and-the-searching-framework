and compare this quantity to the Ksp for barium sulfate.
Does a precipitate form when 0.10 L of 8.0 * 10-3 M Pb1NO322 is added to 0.40 L of 5.0 * 10-3 M Na2SO4?
Solve 
When the two solutions are mixed, the 
volume is 0.10 L + 0.40 L = 0.50 L. The 
number of moles of Pb2 +  in 0.10 L of 
8.0 * 10-3 M Pb1NO322 is:
Analyze The problem asks us to determine whether a precipitate 
forms when two salt solutions are combined.
Plan We should determine the concentrations of all ions just af-
ter the solutions are mixed and compare the value of Q with Ksp 
for any potentially insoluble product. The possible metathesis 
products are PbSO4 and NaNO3. Like all sodium salts NaNO3 is 
soluble, but PbSO4 has a Ksp of 6.3 * 10-7 (Appendix D) and will 
precipitate if the Pb2+ and SO4
2 - concentrations are high enough 
for Q to exceed Ksp.
