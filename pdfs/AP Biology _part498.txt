 a species with a death rate that is constant
over the life span. This describes the hydra, reptiles, and rodents.
Type 3 curves show a very high death rate among the young but
then show that death rates decline for those few individuals that
have survived to a certain age. This is characteristic of fish and
invertebrates that release thousands of eggs, have external
fertilization, and have no parenting; see Figure 12.2.

The stability of populations, communities, and ecosystems is affected by interactions
with both biotic and abiotic factors.
5. Age Structure Diagrams
Another important parameter of populations is age structure. An age
structure diagram shows the relative numbers of individuals at each age.
Figure 12.3 shows two age structure diagrams. Country I shows the age
structure of the human population of India; the pyramidal shape is
characteristic of developing nations with half the population un
