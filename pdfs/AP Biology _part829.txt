ll not measure the O2 directly; you will infer its presence when a leaf
floats to the surface.
For consistency, use a hole punch to punch out small circles from a leaf.
Place the leaf disks into a syringe along with a baking soda solution
(bicarbonate). Create a vacuum by pulling the syringe out about 1 cm
while holding your thumb over the opening of the syringe. The vacuum
removes air from the air spaces in the spongy mesophyll in the leaf and
replaces it with the solution of baking soda. See Figure 19.12.

The 1% bicarbonate solution (NaHCO3) provides CO2 that serves as a
carbon source for photosynthesis. With the air from the spongy mesophyll
replaced by the denser baking soda solution, the leaf disks will sink to the
bottom of the syringe. Transfer them quickly to a beaker that also contains
bicarbonate solution. Shine a light into the beaker so you can observe the
leaf disks. As they carry out photosy
