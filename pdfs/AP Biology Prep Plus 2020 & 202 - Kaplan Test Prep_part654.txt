t bronchial hyperresponsiveness,
common in individuals with asthma and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), is correlated with high IgE levels.
These findings were made by studying siblings who both have the
disease. Which of the following conclusions is best supported by
these findings?
Genes for this trait are located close together on the same
chromosome.
(A)
Bronchial hyperresponsiveness is caused by elevated IgE
levels.
(B)
Individuals develop asthma and COPD entirely due to
environmental factors.
(C)
Genes for these traits are located on opposite ends of the
same chromosome.
(D)
11. When analyzing the genome of a male child with a genetic
disease, researchers discovered that he had two copies of
chromosome 1 that were both inherited from the same parent.
Which of the following does not provide a valid explanation of
how this could have occurred?
Nondisjunction occurred during both oogenesis and
spermatogenesis. An ovum lacking a copy of chromosome 1
was fertilized by a s
