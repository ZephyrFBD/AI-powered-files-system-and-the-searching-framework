Chemical Approaches to Art Restoration. Works of art are 
made from materials that over time can undergo chemical re-
actions that alter their appearance or undermine their mechan-
ical stability. Layers of dirt and pollutants can build up on the 
surface, discoloring statues, murals, and paintings. Plasters that 
serve as the base for frescoes react with gases in the atmosphere. 
One approach to art restoration is to use selected chemical reac-
tions to undo or reverse the effects of detrimental reactions that 
have occurred over time.
One such example involves murals at the ancient Mayan ru-
ins of Mayapan in Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula. In the 1960s, poly-
mer coatings were applied to these murals in an attempt to preserve 
them, but within a decade it became clear that the polymer coatings 
were doing more harm than good. Unfortunately, years of oxida-
tion and cross-linking reactions had rendered the polymer coatings 
insoluble to nearly every type of organ
