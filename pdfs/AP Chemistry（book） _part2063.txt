nit of choice when a solution is to be used 
over a range of temperatures.
Give It Some Thought
If an aqueous solution is very dilute, will its molality be greater than its molarity, 
nearly the same as its molarity, or smaller than its molarity?
A solution is made by dissolving 4.35 g of glucose 1C6H12O62 in 25.0 mL of water at 25 °C. Calculate the molality of glucose in 
the solution. Water has a density of 1.00 g>mL.
Solve 
Use the molar mass of glucose, 180.2 g>mol, 
to convert grams to moles:
Analyze We are asked to calculate a solution concentration in 
units of molality. To do this, we must determine the number of 
moles of solute (glucose) and the number of kilograms of solvent 
(water).
Plan We use the molar mass of C6H12O6 to convert grams of glucose 
to moles. We use the density of water to convert milliliters of water 
to kilograms. The molality equals the number of moles of solute 
(glucose) divided by the number of kilograms of solvent (water).
