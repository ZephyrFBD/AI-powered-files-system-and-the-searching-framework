ing Chemical Equation stoichiometry  
and Equilibrium Constants
There are many ways to write a balanced chemical equation for a given reaction. For 
example, if we multiply Equation 15.1, N2O41g2 ∆ 2 NO21g2 by 2, we have
 
2 N2O41g2 ∆ 4 NO21g2 
This chemical equation is balanced and might be written this way in some contexts. 
Therefore, the equilibrium-constant expression for this equation is
 
Kc =
3NO244
3N2O442 
which is the square of the equilibrium-constant expression given in Equation 15.10 for 
the reaction as written in Equation 15.1: 3NO242>3N2O44. Because the new equilibrium- 
constant expression equals the original expression squared, the new equilibrium con-
stant Kc equals the original constant squared: 0.2122 = 0.0449 1at 100 °C2. Once again, it 
is important to remember that you must relate each equilibrium constant you work with 
to a specific balanced chemical equation. The concentrations of the substances in the equilib-
rium mixture will be the same no matter how yo
