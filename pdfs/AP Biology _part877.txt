 up the
enzyme. (1 point)
The student also included some contradictory statements
and/or incorrect statements and/or was missing information (for
which he or she either lost points [only for the contradictory
statements] or did not earn any points):
An enzyme is a protein catalyst that reacts with every
substrate and speeds up every type of reaction. (Not only is
this statement incorrect, but it also contradicts the statement
in the third sentence of the sample answer, which is correct
and states that “Enzymes are specific, meaning they only
react in certain ways with certain substrates.”)
The model for the specificity of enzyme function is called
“lock and key.” (The correct name for the model is “induced
fit.” However, the student would not lose points for stating
incorrect information; the student would only lose points for
contradicting himself or herself.)
In this case, the student made a contradictory statement, so he
or she would have lost all points for part (a) of this questio
