 can be heated
by means of hot-water conduits or electric heating elements. Such first-rate heat-
ing systems are becoming more common today, and it is interesting to note that
2000 years ago the Romans, even in houses in the remote province of Great Britain,
made use of hot-water and steam conduits in the floor to heat their houses.
T
wo teapots. A ceramic teapot 
and a shiny one 
each hold 0.75 L of tea at 95°C. (a) Estimate the rate
of heat loss from each, and (b) estimate the temperature drop after 30 min for
each. Consider only radiation, and assume the surroundings are at 20°C.
APPROACH We are given all the information necessary to calculate the heat
loss due to radiation, except for the area. The teapot holds 0.75 L, and we can
approximate it as a cube 10 cm on a side 
with five sides
exposed. To estimate the temperature drop in (b), we use the concept of spe-
cific heat and ignore the contribution of the pots compared to that of the water.
SOLUTION (a) The teapot, approximated
