group 1B elements become more negative as we move down 
the group? [Hint: Examine the trends in the electron affinities 
of other groups as we proceed down the periodic table.]
 7.99  Hydrogen is an unusual element because it behaves in some 
ways like the alkali metal elements and in other ways like 
nonmetals. Its properties can be explained in part by its elec-
tron conﬁguration and by the values for its ionization energy 
and electron affinity. (a) Explain why the electron affinity of 
hydrogen is much closer to the values for the alkali elements 
than for the halogens. (b) Is the following statement true? 
“Hydrogen has the smallest bonding atomic radius of any 
element that forms chemical compounds.” If not, correct it. 
If it is, explain in terms of electron conﬁgurations. (c) Explain 
why the ionization energy of hydrogen is closer to the values 
for the halogens than for the alkali metals. (d) The hydride 
ion is H-. Write out the process corresponding to the ﬁrst
