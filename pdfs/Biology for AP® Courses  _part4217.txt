old-tolerant cone-bearing plants. These
are evergreen coniferous trees like pines, spruce, and fir, which retain their needle-shaped leaves year-round. Evergreen
trees can photosynthesize earlier in the spring than deciduous trees because less energy from the sun is required to warm a
needle-like leaf than a broad leaf. This benefits evergreen trees, which grow faster than deciduous trees in the boreal forest.
In addition, soils in boreal forest regions tend to be acidic with little available nitrogen. Leaves are a nitrogen-rich structure
and deciduous trees must produce a new set of these nitrogen-rich structures each year. Therefore, coniferous trees that
retain nitrogen-rich needles may have a competitive advantage over the broad-leafed deciduous trees.
The net primary productivity of boreal forests is lower than that of temperate forests and tropical wet forests. The
aboveground biomass of boreal forests is high because these slow-growing tree species are long lived and accumulate
