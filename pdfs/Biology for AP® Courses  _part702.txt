yzed into ADP in the following reaction:
ATP + H2 O →ADP + Pi + free energy
Like most chemical reactions, the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP is reversible. The reverse reaction regenerates ATP from ADP
+ Pi. Indeed, cells rely on the regeneration of ATP just as people rely on the regeneration of spent money through some sort
of income. Since ATP hydrolysis releases energy, ATP regeneration must require an input of free energy. The formation of
ATP is expressed in this equation:
ADP + Pi + free energy →ATP + H2 O
Two prominent questions remain with regard to the use of ATP as an energy source. Exactly how much free energy is
released with the hydrolysis of ATP, and how is that free energy used to do cellular work? The calculated ∆G for the
hydrolysis of one mole of ATP into ADP and Pi is −7.3 kcal/mole (−30.5 kJ/mol). Since this calculation is true under
standard conditions, it would be expected that a different value exists under cellular conditions. In fact, the ∆G for the
hydrolysis of one
