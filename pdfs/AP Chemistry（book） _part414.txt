, we expect BaCO3 to decompose to BaO and CO2. 
Barium and calcium are both in group 2A in the periodic  
table, which further suggests they react in the same way:
BaCO3(s) ยก BaO(s) + CO2(g)
This reaction is used to produce the bright flame generated by flares and some 
fireworks.
A combination reaction between a metal and a nonmetal, as in Equation 3.6, 
 
produces an ionic solid. Recall that the formula of an ionic compound can be  
determined 
from the charges of its ions. 
 (Section 2.7) When magnesium reacts with oxygen, the 
magnesium loses electrons and forms the magnesium ion, Mg2 +. The oxygen gains elec-
trons and forms the oxide ion, O2 -. Thus, the reaction  
product is MgO.
You should be able to recognize when a reaction is a combination reaction and to 
predict the products when the reactants are a metal and a nonmetal.

Combustion Reactions
Combustion reactions are rapid reactions that produce a flame. Most combu
