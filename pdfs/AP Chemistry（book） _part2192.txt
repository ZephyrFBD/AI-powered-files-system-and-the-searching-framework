te at which O2 appears, ∆3O24>∆t, is 6.0 * 10-5 M>s at a particular instant, at what rate is O3 disappearing at this 
same time, - ∆3O34>∆t?
Solve
(a) Using the coefficients in the balanced 
equation and the relationship given by 
Equation 14.4, we have:
Analyze We are given a balanced chemical equation and asked to 
relate the rate of appearance of the product to the rate of disap-
pearance of the reactant.
Plan We can use the coefficients in the chemical equation as 
shown in Equation 14.4 to express the relative rates of reactions.
Check We can apply a stoichiometric factor to 
convert the O2 formation rate to the O3 disap-
pearance rate:
Rate = -  1

SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 14.3 
Relating Rates at Which Products Appear and Reactants Disappear
(b) Solving the equation from part (a) for the 
rate at which O3 disappears, - ∆3O34>∆t, 
we have:
