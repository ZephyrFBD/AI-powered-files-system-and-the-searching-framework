 could forgive a sacrilege like that. 
 
 I swear. 
 
 All right. Go to bed and from this day out stay far away from that 
 
 misfortunate Quasimodo Dooley. 
 
 We are all confirmed the next day.The bishop asks me a catechism 
 
 question,What is the Fourth Commandment? and I tell him,Honor thy 
 
 father and thy mother. He pats my cheek and that makes me a soldier 
 
 of the True Church. I kneel in the pew and think of Quasimodo locked 
 
 in the coal hole under the stairs and I wonder, Should I give him the 
 
 shilling anyway for his career at the BBC? 
 
 But I forget all about Quasimodo because my nose starts bleeding and 
 
 I feel dizzy. Confirmation boys and girls are outside St. Joseph’s with 
 
 their parents and there is hugging and kissing in the bright sun and I 
 
 don’t care. My father is working and I don’t care. My mother kisses me 
 
  
  
 and I don’t care.The boys talk about The Collection and I don’t care. 
 
 My nose won’t stop and Mam is worried I’ll ruin my suit
