biological evolution by means of a modification of inheritable
characteristics. In this chapter, the term evolution will always refer to
biological evolution.

EVOLUTIONARY MECHANISMS

in which 50 percent of the population have green fins and 50 percent

fins and 49 percent have blue fins, then that species has evolved.
Evolution in this sense has
