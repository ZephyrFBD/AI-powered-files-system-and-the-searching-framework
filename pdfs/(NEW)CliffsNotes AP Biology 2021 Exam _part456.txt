 other
males or possess features that are attractive to females are able to mate. As a result, traits that improve a maleâ€™s
success in these two areas carry a selective advantage. Sexual selection results in attributes that improve success in
contests (such as horns, antlers, large size, or increased musculature) or traits that are attractive to females (such as
good nest-building ability, large territories, or long or colorful feathers as in peacocks and birds of paradise).
Although sexual selection may change allele frequencies over time and result in new traits, speciation (the formation
of a new species) does not necessarily occur.
Question 5
a. Natural selection favors individuals with traits that increase their fitness, that is, their ability to survive and leave
fertile offspring. If all individuals in a population were identical, no one individual would be any more capable of
leaving offspring than any other. Without variation there can be no natural selection.
b. If a trait is
