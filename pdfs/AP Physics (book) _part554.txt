cceleration of
gravity, at (a) 6400 m, and (b) 6400 km, above the Earth’s
surface.
40. (II) You are explaining to friends why an astronaut feels
weightless orbiting in the space shuttle, and they respond
that they thought gravity was just a lot weaker up there.
Convince them that it isn’t so by calculating how much
weaker (in %) gravity is 380 km above the Earth’s surface.
41. (II) Every few hundred years most of the planets line up
on the same side of the Sun. Calculate the total force on
the Earth due to Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn, assuming all
four planets are in a line, Fig. 5–44. The masses are
and the
mean distances of the four planets from the Sun are 
108, 150, 778, and 1430 million km. What fraction of the
Sun’s force on the Earth is this?
