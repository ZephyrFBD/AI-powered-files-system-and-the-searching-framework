ets of chromosomes, which is a frequent
method of sympatric speciation in plants. Plants that develop extra sets of chromosomes usually cannot interbreed
with plants that maintained the original number of chromosomes and will thus become a separate species over time.
Sexual selection in animals can also lead to sympatric speciation.
Reproductive barriers that can cause speciation can be prezygotic or postzygotic. Prezygotic barriers prevent
the formation of a zygote, or a fertilized egg. Postzygotic barriers occur after the zygote is formed, and they
prevent the zygote from developing into a viable and fertile adult organism.
Prezygotic barriers include:
■Habitat isolation—If organisms live in different habitats and do not come in contact with one another, they
cannot mate and form zygotes and are thus reproductively isolated. An example of this would be the black-
tailed deer found in the western United States and the white-tailed deer found in the eastern United States,
which do not
