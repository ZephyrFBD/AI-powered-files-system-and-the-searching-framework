ation (1 point each, 1 point maximum)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Scientists promoted transformation in bacteria using heat shock to
increase the permeability of the plasma membrane, which enabled the
uptake of the plasmid DNA. 
(c) Predict the growth patterns the scientist should expect to see on
the plates. (1 point)
Prediction (1 point)
Used heat shock  
Added chemicals such as CaCl2
Performed sonication 
No growth on plate 2
Growth on plates 1, 3, and 4 
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
There will be no growth on plate 2 and growth on plates 1, 3, and 4 with
the most growth on plates 1 and 3. 
(d) Justify your prediction. (1 point)
Justification (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
On plate 2, which has penicillin and bacteria that have not acquired
resistance from the plasmid, there will be no growth because the penicillin
will kill the bacteria. On plate 4, there will likely be bacterial g
