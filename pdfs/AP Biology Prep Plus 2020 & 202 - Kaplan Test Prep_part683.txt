control over which pairs of organisms mate. The wide variety of breeds of
dogs, which share a common ancestor with wolves, is in large part due to
extensive artificial selection.
These joint processes of variation and selection have spawned the
tremendous amounts of diversity found in the natural world today.
Indeed, biologists generally believe that life originated only once on this
planet and that all living organisms ultimately share a single common
ancestor. This theory is supported by a number of common biochemical
processes that are shared by all living things, such as genetic information
encoded in DNA or RNA, the transcription of RNA from DNA, and the
translation of mRNA codons into specific amino acids. Whatâ€™s more, all
extant (surviving) organisms use ATP as an energy carrier. Accordingly,
ATP is known as the energy currency of life.
Two homeostatic processes that illustrate common ancestry are
excretion and osmoregulation. Earthworms, arthropods, and vertebrates
all use
