capacitor at 330 V. (a) How much electric
energy can be stored? (b) What is the power output if nearly all this energy is
released in 1.0 ms?
APPROACH We use Eq. 17–10 in the form 
because we are given 
C and V.

the
power output is P = pet = (36 J)A1.0 * 10–3 sB = 36,000 W.

EXERCISE G A capacitor stores 0.50 J of energy at 9.0 V. What is its capacitance?
Capacitor plate separation increased.
A parallel-plate capacitor carries charge Q and is then disconnected from a
battery. The
