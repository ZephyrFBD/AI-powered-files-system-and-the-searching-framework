 2.11  A 1.0-g sample of carbon dioxide (CO2) is fully decomposed 
into its elements, yielding 0.273 g of carbon and 0.727 g of 
oxygen. (a) What is the ratio of the mass of O to C? (b) If a 
sample of a different compound decomposes into 0.429 g of 
carbon and 0.571 g of oxygen, what is its ratio of the mass of 
O to C? (c) According to Daltonâ€™s atomic theory, what is the 
empirical formula of the second compound?
 2.12  Hydrogen sulfide is composed of two elements: hydrogen and 
sulfur. In an experiment, 6.500 g of hydrogen sulfide is fu
