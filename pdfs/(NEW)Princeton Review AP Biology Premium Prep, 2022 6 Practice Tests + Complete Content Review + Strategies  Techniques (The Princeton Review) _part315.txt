have two copies of each chromosome, but individuals with Down syndrome have three—instead of two—copies of
the 21st chromosome.
Down syndrome is also known as trisomy 21. Two other conditions you should
be familiar with are Turner Syndrome (45XO), which occurs when a female is
missing part of or a whole X chromosome, and Klinefelter’s Syndrome
(47XXY), which occurs when a male has an extra X chromosome.
Nondisjunction can occur in anaphase I (meaning chromosomes don’t separate when they should), or in anaphase II
(meaning chromatids don’t separate). Either one can lead to aneuploidy, or the presence of an abnormal number of
chromosomes in a cell.
Chromosomal abnormalities also occur if one or more segments of a chromosome break and are either lost or
reattach to another chromosome. The most common example is translocation, which occurs when a segment of a
chromosome moves to another nonhomologous chromosome.
Here’s an example of a translocation.
Translocations can occur when recombin
