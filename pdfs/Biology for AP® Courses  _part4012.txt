49. B cells are important immune cells that fight
infections. How is a na√Øve B cell stimulated to mature into
a plasma cell that secretes antibodies?
a.
T cells secrete cytokines, which help the B cell
to multiply and mature into an antibody-
producing plasma cell.
b.
Natural killer cells secrete cytokines, which help
the B cell to multiply and mature into an
antibody-producing plasma cell.
c.
T cells secrete interferons, which help the B cell
to multiply and mature into an antibody-
producing plasma cell.
d.
Natural killer cells secrete interferons, which
help the B cell to multiply and mature into an
antibody-producing plasma cell.
