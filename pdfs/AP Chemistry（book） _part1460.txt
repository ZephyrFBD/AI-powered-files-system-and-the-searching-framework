ent charge, as they did in the 
 
plots in Figures 9.10 and 9.11.) As with the sine function, the 
origin is a node.
The third graph in Figure 9.38 shows that when we square 
the wave function of the 2pz orbital, we get two peaks that 
are symmetrical about the origin. Both peaks are positive because 
squaring a negative number produces a positive number. Thus, 
we lose the phase information of the function upon squaring it just as we 
did for the sine function. When we square the wave function for 
the pz orbital, we get the probability density for the orbital, which 
is given as a contour representation in Figure 9.38. This is what we 
saw in the earlier presentation of p orbitals. 
 (Section 6.6) For 
this squared wave function, both lobes have the same phase and 
therefore the same sign. We use this representation throughout 
most of this book because it has a simple physical interpretation: 
The square of the wave function at any point in space represents 
the electron density at
