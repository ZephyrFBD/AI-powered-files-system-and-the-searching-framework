orce (emf) that 
moves the electrons from the anode to the cathode through the 
external circuit. The origin of emf is a difference in the electrical 
potential energy of the two electrodes in the cell. The emf of a cell 
is called its cell potential, Ecell and is measured in volts 11 V = 1 J>C2. 
The cell potential under standard conditions is called the standard 
emf, or the standard cell potential, and is denoted E°
cell.
A standard reduction potential, E°
red, can be assigned for an individ-
ual half-reaction. This is achieved by comparing the potential of the 
half-reaction to that of the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), which is 
defined to have E°
red = 0 V.
The standard cell potential of a voltaic cell is the difference be-
tween the standard reduction potentials of the half-reactions that 
occur at the cathode and the anode:
E°
cell = E°
red 1cathode2 - E°
red 1anode2.
The value of E°
cell is positive for a voltaic cell.
For a reduction half-reaction, E°
red is a measure of
