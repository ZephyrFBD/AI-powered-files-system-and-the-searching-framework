t cells have chloroplasts as well as
plasmodesmata which are lacking in animal cells.
c.
Plant cells have cell walls which provide structure to the plant and also chloroplasts which allow for
photosynthesis. Animal cells do not have either of these structures. Animal cells and plant cells both have
glyoxysomes as well cytoplasm.
d.
Plant cells and animal cells both have a rigid plasma membrane as well as cytoplasm which is the gel-like
solution that fills the cell. Plant cells have cell walls which provide structure to the plant and also chloroplasts
which allow for photosynthesis. Animal cells do not have either of these structures.
