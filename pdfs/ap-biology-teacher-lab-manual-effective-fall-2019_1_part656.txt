experience, you might decide to modify the investigation in the Student Manual 
or create your own version. You and your students will naturally arrive at workable 
procedures for monitoring energy or biomass in plants and animals. The Student Manual 
is set up only as an example to introduce skills. The ultimate goal is for you and your 
students to become a research team carrying out an authentic research experience. 
The idea of developing mathematical models can be particularly challenging. The 
values for energy capture and transfer measured in Procedures can serve as a foundation 
for building a predictive, simple spreadsheet model in the final part of the investigation. 
The model could focus solely on plant growth or butterfly growth, or it could model the 
interaction between the two.

modes of formal communication: peer-reviewed papers published in journals, paper
