 pH of a 
0.020 M solution of Co1NO322 is adjusted to 8.5? (b) Will 
AgIO3 precipitate when 20 mL of 0.010 M AgIO3 is mixed 
with 10 mL of 0.015 M NaIO3? 1Ksp of AgIO3 is 3.1 * 10-8.2
 17.71  Calculate the minimum pH needed to precipitate Mn1OH22 
so completely that the concentration of Mn2 +1aq2 is less 
than 1 mg per liter [1 part per billion (ppb)].
 17.72  Suppose that a 10-mL sample of a solution is to be tested for 
I- ion by addition of 1 drop (0.2 mL) of 0.10 M Pb1NO322. 
What is the minimum number of grams of I- that must be 
present for PbI21s2 to form?
