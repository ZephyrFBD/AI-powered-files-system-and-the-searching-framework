s a particular color because it either 
reflects or transmits light of that color or absorbs light of the comple-
mentary color. The amount of light absorbed by a sample as a function 
of wavelength is known as its absorption spectrum. The light absorbed 
provides the energy to excite electrons to higher-energy states.
It is possible to determine the number of unpaired electrons in 
a complex from its degree of paramagnetism. Compounds with no 
unpaired electrons are diamagnetic.
CRYSTAL-FIELD THEORY (SECTION 23.6) Crystal-field theory suc-
cessfully accounts for many properties of coordination compounds, 
including their color and magnetism. In crystal-field theory, the 
interaction between metal ion and ligand is viewed as electrostatic. 
Because some d orbitals point directly at the ligands whereas oth-
ers point between them, the ligands split the energies of the metal 
d orbitals. For an octahedral complex, the d orbitals are split into a 
lower-energy set of three degenerate orbi
