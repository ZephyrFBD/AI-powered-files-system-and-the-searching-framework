(a) Describe the characteristics of juxtacrine signaling. Draw a square around the step (1, 2, 3, or 4) in the
figure illustrates an example of juxtacrine signaling.
(b) Explain the role cytokines play in the cell signaling process described above.
(c) Circle a molecule that represents a secondary messenger in the figure.
(d) Explain how secondary messengers can amplify a response in a cell.
6. A student investigated the effect of caffeine on the number of cells in mitosis and interphase in onion root tip
cells. Onions were planted in sand in two groups. One group of onions received distilled water, and the second
group received an aqueous solution of 0.002 M caffeine for two days. The tips of the roots were removed and
stained, and the number of cells in mitosis and interphase was counted. The data appear in the table below.
(a) Calculate the percentage of cells in mitosis and interphase observed in each group.
(b) Identify the con
