14–8 Heat Transfer: Radiation
Convection and conduction require the presence of matter as a medium to carry
the heat from the hotter to the colder region. But a third type of heat transfer
occurs without any medium at all. All life on Earth depends on the transfer of
energy from the Sun, and this energy is transferred to the Earth over empty (or
nearly empty) space. This form of energy transfer is heat—since the Sun’s surface
temperature (6000 K) is much higher than Earth’s 
—and is referred to
as radiation (Fig. 14–10). The warmth we receive from a fire is mainly radiant
energy.
As we shall see in later Chapters, radiation consists essentially of electromag-
netic waves. Suffice it to say for now that r
