Combustion of coal accounts for about 65% of the SO2 released annually in the 
United States, and combustion of oil accounts for another 20%. The majority of this 
amount is from coal-burning electrical power plants, which generate about 50% of 
our electricity. The extent to which SO2 emissions are a problem when coal is burned 
depends on the amount of sulfur in the coal. Because of concern about SO2 pollution, 
low-sulfur coal is in greater demand and is thus more expensive. Much of the coal from 
east of the Mississippi is relatively high in sulfur content, up to 6% by mass. Much of the 
coal from the western states has a lower sulfur content, but also a lower heat content per 
unit mass, so the difference in sulfur content per unit of heat produced is not as large as 
is often assumed.
In 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency set new standards to reduce 
SO2 emissions. The old standard of 140 parts per billion, measured over 24 h
