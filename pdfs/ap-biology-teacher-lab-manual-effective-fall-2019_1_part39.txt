phila melanogaster is an organism that has been studied in the scientific 
community for more than a century. Thomas Hunt Morgan began using Drosophila 
melanogaster for genetic studies in 1907. The common fruit fly lives throughout the 
world and feeds on the fungi of rotting fruit. It is a small fly, and one could question 
why so much time and effort have been directed to this organism. It is about the size of 
President Rooseveltâ€™s nose on a dime, but despite its small size, the fly is packed with 
interesting physical and behavioral characteristics. Its genome has been sequenced, 
its physical characteristics have been charted and mutated, its meiotic processes and 
development have been investigated, and its behavior has been the source of many 
experiments. Because of its scientific usefulness, Drosophila is a model research 
organism. Its name is based on observations about the fly; the fly follows circadian 
rhythms that include sleeping during the dark and emerging as an adul
