9–7 Spanning a Space: Arches and Domes
There are a great many areas where the arts and humanities overlap the sciences,
and this is especially clear in architecture, where the forces in the materials that
make up a structure need to be understood to avoid excessive deformation and
collapse. Many of the features we admire in the architecture of the past were intro-
