 sure cell division is happening properly in eukaryotic
cells. They monitor the cell to make sure it is ready to progress through the cell cycle and stop progression if it is
not. In eukaryotes, checkpoint pathways function mainly at phase boundaries (such as the G1/S transition and the
G2/M transition). Checkpoint pathways are an example of an important cell signaling pathway inside cells.
For example, if the DNA genome has been damaged in some way, the cell should not divide. If it does, damaged
DNA will be passed onto daughter cells, which can be disastrous. When damaged DNA is found, checkpoints are
activated and cell cycle progression stops. The cell uses the extra time to repair damage in DNA. If the DNA
damage is so extensive that it cannot be repaired, the cell can undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death.
Apoptosis cannot stop once it has begun, so it is a highly regulated process. It is an important part of normal cell
turnover in multicellular organisms.
