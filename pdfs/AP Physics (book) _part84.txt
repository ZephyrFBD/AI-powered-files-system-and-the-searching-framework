1â€“5 Units, Standards, and 
the SI System
The measurement of any quantity is made relative to a particular standard or unit,
and this unit must be specified along with the numerical value of the quantity.
For example,
we can measure length in British units such as inches,
feet, or miles, or in the metric system in centimeters, meters, or kilometers. To
specify that the length of a particular object is 18.6 is insufficient. The unit
must be given, because 18.6 meters is very different from 18.6 inches or 
18.6 millimeters.
For any unit we use, such as the meter for distance or the second for time,
we need to define a standard which defines exactly how long one meter or one
second is. It is important that standards be chosen that are readily reproducible
so that anyone needing to make a very accurate measurement can refer to the
standard in the laboratory and communicate with
