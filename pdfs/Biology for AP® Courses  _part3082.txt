ystem (CNS) consists of the brain and spinal cord, both of which are protected by the skull and
vertebral column, respectively. The CNS receives sensory information, integrates this information, and initiates a motor
response, with the brain serving as the control center for processing sensory information and directing responses. Different
parts of the vertebrate brain (including ours) have different functions, and brain development in animals reveals a unique
evolutionary progression. You do not have to memorize all the different parts of the brain and their functions for AP.
However, as a student of biology, you should have a general understanding of the three major parts of the brain and their
functions.
In mammals, the parts of the brain include the cerebrum or cortex (which can be broken down into four primary
lobes: frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal), basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, limbic system, cerebellum, and
brainstem. Information traveling up the spinal cord
