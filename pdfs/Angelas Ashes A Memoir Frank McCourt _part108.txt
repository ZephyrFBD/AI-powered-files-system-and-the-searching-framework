nute. Dad takes the knife and starts slicing the bread and you can see 
 
 Grandma doesn’t like that. She frowns at him but says nothing even 
 
 though he makes thick slices. 
 
 There aren’t enough chairs for everyone so I sit on the stairs with 
 
 57 
 
 my brothers to have bread and tea. Dad and Mam sit at the table and 
 
 Grandma sits under the Sacred Heart with her mug of tea. She says, I 
 
  
  
 don’t know under God what I’m goin’ to do with ye.There is no room 
 
 in this house.There isn’t room for even one of ye. 
 
 Malachy says,Ye,ye, and starts to giggle and I say,Ye,ye, and the twins 
 
 say,Ye, ye, and we’re laughing so hard we can hardly eat our bread. 
 
 Grandma glares at us. What are ye laughin’ at? There’s nothin’ to 
 
 laugh at in this house.Ye better behave yeerselves before I go over to ye. 
 
 She won’t stop saying Ye, and now Malachy is helpless with laughter, 
 
 spewing out his bread and tea, his face turning red. 
 
 Dad says,Malachy and the rest of you,
