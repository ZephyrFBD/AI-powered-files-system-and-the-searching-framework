FIGURE 25–46 Reconstructing the image using projections in an iterative procedure.
Next we use the projections at angle 2. We calculate the difference between the
measured projections at angle 2 (6 and 14) and the projections based on the pre-
vious estimate (top row:
same for bottom row). Then we distribute
this difference equally to the squares in that row. For the top row, we have
and for the bottom row,
These values are inserted as shown in Fig. 25–46c. Next, the projection at angle 3
(
), combined with the difference as above, gives
and then for angle 4 we have
