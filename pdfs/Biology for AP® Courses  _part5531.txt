thanks to caring people like the Rockefellers and other
Cult assets. The Rockefeller Foundation, which pre-empted the
‘Covid pandemic’ in a document published in 2010 that ‘predicted’
what happened a decade later, announced an initial $34.95 million
grant in February, 2021, ‘to ensure more equitable access to Covid-19
testing and vaccines’ among other things in Africa in collaboration
with ‘24 organizations, businesses, and government agencies’. The
pan-Africa initiative would focus on 10 countries: Burkina Faso,
Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania,
Uganda, and Zambia’. Rajiv Shah, President of the Rockefeller
Foundation and former administrator of CIA-controlled USAID, said
that if Africa was not mass-vaccinated (to change the DNA of its
people) it was a ‘threat to all of humanity’ and not fair on Africans.
When someone from the Rockefeller Foundation says they want to
do something to help poor and deprived people and countries it is
time for a belly-laugh.
