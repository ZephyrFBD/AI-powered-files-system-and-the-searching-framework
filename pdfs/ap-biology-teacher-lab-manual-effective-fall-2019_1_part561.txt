compare? What factors could explain a transformation efficiency that was greater 
or less than predicted?

â–  Evaluating Results  
1. What are some challenges you had in performing your investigation? Did you make 
any incorrect assumptions? 
2. What are some possible sources of error in the transformation procedure? If you had 
to repeat the procedure, what are ways to minimize potential sources of error? 
3. Were you able to perform without difficulty the mathematical routines required to 
calculate transformation efficiency? Which calculations, if any, were challenging or 
required help from your classmates or teacher? 
4. Can you suggest other preliminary activities that would have better prepared you to 
tackle the investigation? 
5. Does a bacterial cell take in a plasmid with genes the cell already possesses? If so, 
would this af
