momentum
gained by the rocket itself (see Fig. 7–6). Thus, a rocket can accelerate in empty
space. There is no need for the expelled gases to push against the Earth or the 
air (as is sometimes erroneously thought). Similar examples of (nearly) isolated
systems where momentum is conserved are the recoil of a gun when a bullet is fired
(Example 7–5), and the movement of a rowboat just after a package is thrown from it.

Falling on or off a sled. (a) An empty sled
is sliding on frictionless ice when Susan drops vertically from a tree down onto
the sled. When she lands, does the sled speed up, slow down, or keep the same
speed? (b) Later: Susan falls sideways off the
