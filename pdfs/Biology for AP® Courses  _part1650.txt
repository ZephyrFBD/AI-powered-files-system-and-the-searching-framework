ence is not identical to the E. coli TATA box, but it conserves the A–T rich element. The
thermostability of A–T bonds is low and this helps the DNA template to locally unwind in preparation for transcription.

Figure 15.10 A generalized promoter of a gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II is shown. Transcription factors
recognize the promoter. RNA polymerase II then binds and forms the transcription initiation complex.
Figure 15.11 Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be spliced out. A 5' cap and 3' poly-A tail are also
added.
A scientist splices a eukaryotic promoter in front of a bacterial gene and inserts the gene in a bacterial chromosome.
Would you expect the bacterium to transcribe the gene?
a.
Initially the bacterium will not transcribe it, but will transcribe after 5’ capping.
b.
It will not transcribe it because there is no poly A tail in prokaryotes.
c.
No, prokaryotes use different promoters than eukaryotes.
d.
Yes, the bacterium woul
