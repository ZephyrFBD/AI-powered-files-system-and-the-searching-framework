light is expected to be of nearly the same luminosity. They are thus sometimes
referred to as “standard candles.”

ESTIMATE
Another important technique for estimating the distance of very distant
galaxies is from the “redshift” in the line spectra of elements and compounds.
The redshift is related to the expansion of the universe, as we shall discuss in
Section 33–5. It is useful for objects farther than 
to 
ly away.
As we look farther and farther away, measurement techniques are les
