 will continue to
produce estrogen and progesterone to maintain the endometrium. Without hCG, menstruation would begin and the
embryo would abort. (Pregnancy tests check for the presence of hCG in the urine.) Later during development, hCG
is replaced by progesterone secreted by the placenta. In this way, the embryo directly maintains the pregnancy.
The menstrual cycle, as described above, consists of the thickening of the endometrium of the uterus in preparation
for implantation of a fertilized egg and the shedding of the endometrium if implantation does not occur. The ovarian
cycle consists of three phases, as follows:
1. Follicular phase: the development of the egg and the secretion of estrogen from the follicle
 
2. Ovulation: the midcycle release of the egg
 
3. Luteal phase: the secretion of estrogen and progesterone from the corpus luteum after ovulation
The male reproductive cycle is regulated by the same hormones that regulate the female reproductive cycle. In
response to GnRH
