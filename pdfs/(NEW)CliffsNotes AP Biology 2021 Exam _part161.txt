membrane, consists of a double layer of phospholipids.
2. Intermembrane space. This is the narrow area between the inner and outer membranes.
3. Inner membrane. This second membrane is also a double phospholipid bilayer.
4. Stroma. The stroma is the fluid material that fills the area inside the
 
inner membrane. The Calvin cycle occurs here, fixing carbon from CO2
 
to generate G3P, the precursor to glucose.
5. Thylakoids. Suspended within the stroma are stacks of pancake-like membranes. Individual membrane layers
(the “pancakes”) are thylakoids; an entire stack of thylakoids is a granum (plural, grana). The membranes of the
thylakoids contain the protein complexes (including the photosystems PS I and PS II), cytochromes, and other
electron carriers of the light-dependent reactions.
6. Thylakoid lumen. This is the inside, or lumen, of the thylakoid; H+
 
ions (protons) accumulate here.
Note how the spatial arrangement of the photosynthetic processes in chloroplasts is similar to that f
