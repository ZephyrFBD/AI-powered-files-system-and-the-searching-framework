1 Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)
A wonderful use of polarization is in a liquid crystal display (LCD). LCDs are
used as the display in cell phones, other hand-held electronic devices, and flat-panel
computer and television screens.
A liquid crystal display is made up of many tiny rectangles called pixels, or
“picture elements.”The picture you see depends on which pixels are dark or light
and of what color, as suggested in Fig. 24–49 for a simple black and white picture.
Liquid crystals are organic materials that at room temperature exist in a
phase that is neither fully solid nor fully liquid. They are sort of gooey, and their
molecules display a randomness of position characteristic of liquids, as dis-
cussed in Section 13–1 and Fig. 13–2b. They also show some of the orderliness of a
solid crystal (Fig. 13–2a), but only in one dimension.
The liquid crystals we find useful are made up of relatively rigid rod-like
molecules that i
