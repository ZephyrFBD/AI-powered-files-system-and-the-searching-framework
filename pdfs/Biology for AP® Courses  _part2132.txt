scientists a mathematical baseline of a non-evolving population to which they can compare evolving
populations and thereby infer what evolutionary forces might be at play. If the frequencies of alleles or genotypes deviate
from the value expected from the Hardy–Weinberg equation, then the population is evolving.
Use this online calculator (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hardy-weinberg) to determine the genetic structure of a
population.
What would violate the conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?
a.
random mating
b.
mutations
c.
large population
d.
no natural selection
Lab Investigation
AP® Biology Investigative Labs: Inquiry-Based Approach, Investigation 2: Mathematical Modeling:
Hardy–Weinberg. In this lab investigation, you apply the Hardy–Weinberg equation and create a
spreadsheet to study changes in allele frequencies in a population and to examine possible causes for these
changes.
Think About It
Imagine you are trying to determine if a population of flowers is undergoing micro
