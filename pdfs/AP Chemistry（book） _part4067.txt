ons. 13.23 (a) Supersaturated (b) The bits of glass scraped from the 
vessel act as a seed crystal, a place where solute molecules can align 
to form a crystal. The excess chromium nitrate is crystallizing out.  
(c) 116 g crystals form 13.25 (a) Unsaturated (b) saturated (c) saturated 
(d) unsaturated 13.27 (a) We expect the liquids water and glycerol 
to be miscible in all proportions. (b) Hydrogen bonding, dipole-
dipole forces, London dispersion forces 13.29 Toluene, C6H5CH3, is 
the best solvent for nonpolar solutes. Without polar groups or non-
bonding electron pairs, it forms only dispersion interactions with 
itself and  other molecules. 13.31 (a) Carbon tetrachloride (b) water 
 
13.33 (a) CCl4 is more soluble because dispersion forces among 
nonpolar CCl4  molecules are similar to dispersion forces in hexane. 
(b) C6H6 is a nonpolar hydrocarbon and will be more soluble in the 
similarly nonpolar hexane. (c) The long, rodlike hydrocarbon chain 
of octanoic acid forms strong di
