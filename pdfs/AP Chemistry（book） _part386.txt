 (a) Using arrangement A, how many Rb atoms could be placed 
on a square surface that is 1.0 cm on a side? (b) How many Rb 
atoms could be placed on a square surface that is 1.0 cm on a 
side, using arrangement B? (c) By what factor has the number 
of atoms on the surface increased in going to arrangement B 
from arrangement A? If extended to three dimensions, which 
arrangement would lead to a greater density for Rb metal?
