23. (II) A small rubber wheel is used to drive a large pottery
wheel. The two wheels are mounted so that their circular
edges touch. The small wheel has a radius of 2.0 cm and
accelerates at the rate of

the pottery wheel (radius 27.0 cm) without slipping. Calcu-
late (a) the angular acceleration of the pottery wheel, and
(b) the time it takes the pottery wheel to reach its required
speed of 65 rpm.
