ssure lowering, freezing-point 
lowering, boiling-point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Raoult’s 
law expresses the lowering of vapor pressure. An ideal solution obeys 
Raoult’s law. Differences in solvent–solute as compared with solvent–
solvent and solute–solute intermolecular forces cause many solu-
tions to depart from ideal behavior.
A solution containing a nonvolatile solute possesses a higher 
boiling point than the pure solvent. The molal boiling-point-elevation 
constant, Kb, represents the increase in boiling point for a 1 m solution 
of solute particles as compared with the pure solvent. Similarly, the 
molal freezing-point-depression constant, Kf, measures the lowering of 
the freezing point of a solution for a 1 m solution of solute particles. 
The temperature changes are given by the equations ∆T
b = iKbm and 
∆T
f = -iKf m where i is the van’t Hoff factor, which represents how 
many particles the solute breaks up into in the solvent. When NaCl 
dissolves in water, two m
