web of life.” In
an effort to save the tree analogy, some have proposed using the Ficus tree (Figure 20.17b) with its multiple trunks as a
phylogenetic to represent a diminished evolutionary role for HGT.

Figure 20.17 In the (a) phylogenetic model proposed by W. Ford Doolittle, the “tree of life” arose from a community
of ancestral cells, has multiple trunks, and has connections between branches where horizontal gene transfer has
occurred. Visually, this concept is better represented by (b) the multi-trunked Ficus than by the single trunk of the oak
similar to the tree drawn by Darwin Figure 20.12. (credit b: modification of work by "psyberartist"/Flickr)
Ring of Life Models
Others have proposed abandoning any tree-like model of phylogeny in favor of a ring structure, the so-called “ring of
life” (Figure 20.18); a phylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes.
