I
n our discussion of the behavior of light in the two previous Chapters, we
also described a few instruments such as the spectrometer and the Michelson
interferometer. In this Chapter, we will discuss some more common instru-
ments, most of which use lenses, including the camera, telescope, microscope,
and the human eye. To describe their operation, we will use ray diagrams as we
did in Chapter 23. However, we will see that understanding some aspects of their
operation will require the wave nature of light.
25–1 Cameras: Film and Digital
The basic elements of a camera are a lens, a light-tight box, a shutter to let light
pass through the lens only briefly, and in a digital camera an electronic sensor or
in a traditional camera a piece of film (Fig. 25–1). When the shutter is opened for
a brief “exposure,” light from external objects in the field of
