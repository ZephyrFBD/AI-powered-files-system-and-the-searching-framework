unt of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated
from rubbing the tissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax. Pleurisy results when these layers of tissue become
inflamed; it is painful because the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of
the lung.

How does the relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas, as described by Boyle’s law, relate to the changes
in lung pressure during inhalation and exhalation?
a.
Boyle’s law states the pressure of a gas is directly proportional
