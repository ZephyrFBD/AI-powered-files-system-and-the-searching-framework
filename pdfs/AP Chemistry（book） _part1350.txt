l—O bonds are all single bonds? (c) What is the 
oxidation number of Cl in the hypochlorite ion? (d) What 
is the oxidation number of Cl in the perchlorate ion, assum-
ing the Cl—O bonds are all single bonds? (e) In a redox reac-
tion, which ion would you expect to be more easily reduced?

Draw the Lewis structure(s) for the triazine molecule. (b) Es-
timate the carbon–nitrogen bond distances in the ring.
 [8.94] Ortho-Dichlorobenzene, C6H4Cl2, is obtained when two of 
the adjacent hydrogen atoms in benzene are replaced with 
Cl atoms. A skeleton of the molecule is shown here. (a) Com-
plete a Lewis structure for the
