rce is shown striking
a half-silvered mirror 
This beam splitter mirror 
has a thin layer of silver
that reflects only half the light that hits it, so that half of the beam passes through
to a fixed mirror 
where it is reflected back. The other half is reflected by 
to a mirror 
that is movable (by a fine-thread screw), where it is also reflected
back. Upon its return, part of beam 1 passes through 
and reaches a sensor or
the eye; and part of beam 2, on its return, is reflected by 
into the eye. If the two
path lengths are identical, the two coherent beams entering the eye constructively
interfere and brightness will be seen. If the movable mirror is moved a distance
one beam will travel an extra distance equal to 
(because it travels back
and forth over the distance 
). In this case, the two beams will destructively
interfere and darkness will be seen. As 
is moved farther, brightness will recur
(when the path difference is ), then darkness, and so on.
Very precise length measurement
