n be classified as either leptons or
hadrons. Leptons participate only in gravity, the weak, and the
electromagnetic interactions.
Hadrons,
which today are
considered composite particles, are made up of quarks, and
participate in all four interactions, including the strong interac-
tion. The hadrons can be classified as mesons, with baryon
number zero, and baryons, with nonzero baryon number.
Most particles, except for the photon, electron, neutrinos,
and proton, decay with measurable mean lives varying from
to 
The mean life depends on which force is pre-
dominant. Weak decays usually have mean lives greater than
about 
Electromagnetic decays typically have mean lives
on the order of 
to 
The shortest lived particles, called
resonances, decay via the strong interaction and live typically
for only about 
Today’s Standard Model of elementary particles considers
quarks as the basic building blocks of the hadrons. The six
