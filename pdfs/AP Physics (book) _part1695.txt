26. (II) A heat engine exhausts its heat at 340°C and has a
Carnot efficiency of 36%. What exhaust temperature would
enable it to achieve a Carnot efficiency of 42%?
27. (II) A Carnot engine’s operating temperatures are 210°C
and 45°C. The engine’s power output is 910 W. Calculate
the rate of heat output.
28. (II) A four-cylinder gasoline engine has an efficiency of 0.22
and delivers 180 J of work per cycle per cylinder. If the engine
runs at 25 cycles per second (1500 rpm), determine (a) the
work done per second, and (b) the total heat input per
second from the gasoline. (c) If the energy content of 
gasoline is 130 MJ per gallon, how long does one gallon
last?
29. (II) A Carnot engine performs work at the rate of 520 kW
with an input of 950 kcal of heat per second. If the tem-
perature of the heat source is 520°C, at what temperature
is the waste heat exhausted?
30. (II) A heat engine uses a heat source at 580°C and has an ideal
(Carnot) efficiency of 22%. To increase the idea
