to give a resultant,
implies that
(3;5)
That is, the sum of the x components equals the x component of the resultant vector,
and the sum of the y components equals the y component of the resultant, as can
be verified by a careful examination of Fig. 3–14. Note that we do not add x compo-
nents to y components.
If the magnitude and direction of the resultant vector are desired, they can
be obtained using Eqs. 3–4.
