This form of the uncertainty principle tells us that the energy of an object can be
uncertain (or can be interpreted as briefly nonconserved) by an amount 
for a
time
The quantity 
appears so often in quantum mechanics that for conven-
ience it is given the symbol 
(“h-bar”). That is,
By using this notation, Eqs. 28–1 and 28–2 for the uncertainty principle can be
written
and
We have been discussing the position and velocity of an electron as if it were
a particle. But it isn’t simply a particle. Indeed, we have the uncertainty principle
because an electron—and matter in general—has wave as well as particle prop-
erties. What the uncertainty principle really tells us is that if we insist on thinking
of the electron as a particle, then there are certain limitations on this simplified
view—namely, that the position and velocity cannot both be known precisely at
the same time; and even that the electron does not have a precise position and
momentum at the same time (because it
