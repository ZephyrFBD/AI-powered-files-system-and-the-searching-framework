Optometrists’ prescriptions specify the power (

SOLUTION Given that
and
the thin lens equation
gives
So
The power P of the lens is
The
plus sign indicates that it is a converging lens.
NOTE We chose the image position to be where the eye can actually focus. The lens
needs to put the image there, given the desired placement of the object (newspaper).

FIGURE 25–11 Correcting eye defects
with lenses. (a) A nearsighted eye, which
cannot focus clearly on distant objects
(focal point is in front of retina), can 
be corrected (b) by use of a diverging lens.
(c) A farsighted eye, which cannot focus
clearly on nearby objects (focus point
behind retina), can be corrected (d) by
use of a converging lens.
