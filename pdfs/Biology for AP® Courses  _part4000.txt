c.
As new pathogens evolve all the time, it is more
conservative of energy and information storage
to have an adaptive immune system that can
respond to different pathogens in a specific way.
d.
As new pathogens evolve all the time, it is more
conservative of energy and information storage
to have an adaptive immune system that can
respond to different pathogens in a non-specific
way.
35. Invertebrate animals have innate immune systems but
lack adaptive immune systems. Vertebrates, including fish,
amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals have both
systems. What does this suggest about the evolution of
these two immune systems?

a.
This suggests that the innate immune system
evolved first. Invertebrates and vertebrates had a
common ancestor, which had an innate immune
system. After the two lineages diverged, the
vertebrate line developed adaptive immunity,
which continued to evolve in all vertebrates.
b.
This suggests that the adap
