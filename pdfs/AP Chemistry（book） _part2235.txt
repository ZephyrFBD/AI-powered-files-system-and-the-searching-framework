activation energy, Ea, and its value varies from reaction to reaction.
The situation during reactions is analogous to that shown in Figure 14.15. The golfer 
hits the ball to make it move over the hill in the direction of the cup. The hill is a barrier 
between ball and cup. To reach the cup, the player must impart enough kinetic energy 
with the putter to move the ball to the top of the barrier. If he does not impart enough 
energy, the ball will roll partway up the hill and then back down toward him. In the 
same way, molecules require a certain minimum energy to break existing bonds during a
