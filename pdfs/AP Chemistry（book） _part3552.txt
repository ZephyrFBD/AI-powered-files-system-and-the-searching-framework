d in Section 20.2. Thus, 
we begin with two half-reactions, one involving the NH2OH and 
N2 and the other involving Cu2 +  and Cu.
Solve 
The unbalanced and incomplete half-reactions are
Cu2 +1aq2 ¡ Cu1s2
NH2OH1aq2 ¡ N21g2
Balancing these equations as described in Section 20.2 gives
Cu2 +1aq2 + 2 e - ¡ Cu1s2
2 NH2OH1aq2 ¡ N21g2 + 2 H2O1l2 + 2 H+1aq2 + 2 e -
Adding these half-reactions gives the balanced equation:
Cu2 +1aq2 + 2 NH2OH1aq2 ¡
Cu1s2 + N21g2 + 2 H2O1l2 + 2 H+1aq2
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
In power plants, hydrazine is used to prevent corrosion of the 
metal parts of steam boilers by the O2 dissolved in the water. 
The hydrazine reacts with O2 in water to give N2 and H2O. 
Write a balanced equation for this reaction.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Methylhydrazine, N2H3CH31l2, is used with the oxidizer dini-
trogen tetroxide, N2O41l2, to power the steering rockets of the 
Space Shuttle orbiter. The reaction of these two substances 
produces N2, CO2, and H2O. Write a balanced equation for
