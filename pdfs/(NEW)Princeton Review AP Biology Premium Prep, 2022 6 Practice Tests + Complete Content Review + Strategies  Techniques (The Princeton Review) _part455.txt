consumer), and brook trout (a tertiary consumer) present at five different locations. The percent change relative to
1980 is shown in Figure 1 above. Many aquatic organisms cannot live in low pH conditions. The minimum pH
necessary for common aquatic organisms to sustain life is shown in Table 1.

(B) 5.5
(C) 5.1
(D) 4.7
5. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the abrupt decrease in pH in Richard Creek?
(A) Greenhouse effect
(B) Deforestation
(C) Acid rain
(D) Pollution
6. In order for snails to return to Richard Creek, the pH of the creek must exceed
(A) 5.4
(B) 5.7
(C) 6.0
(D) 6.1
7. Mimosa pudica is a plant often called the “sensitive plant” because when you touch the leaves, they
immediately close up. One theory about the purpose of this type of movement is that herbivores avoid the plant
due to this movement. The mov
