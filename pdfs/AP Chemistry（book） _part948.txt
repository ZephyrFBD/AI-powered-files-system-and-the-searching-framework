ymmetric, the value of c for an s electron depends 
only on its distance from the nucleus, r. Thus, the probability den-
sity can be written as 3c1r242, where c1r2 is the value of c at r. This 
function 3c1r242 gives the probability density for any point located a 
distance r from the nucleus.
The radial probability function, which we used in Figure 6.19, 
differs from the probability density. The radial probability function 
equals the total probability of ﬁnding the electron at all the points 
at any distance r from the nucleus. In other words, to calculate this 
function, we need to “add up” the probability densities 3c1r242 over 
all points located a distance r from the nucleus. Figure 6.21 compares 
the probability density at a point 3c1r242 with the radial probability 
function.
Let’s examine the difference between probability density and 
 
radial probability function more closely. Figure 6.22 shows plots of 
3c1r242 as a function of r for the 1s, 2s, and 3s orbitals of the
