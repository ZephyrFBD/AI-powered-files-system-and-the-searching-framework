FIGURE 9–27 Example 9–12.
A tragic substitution. Two walkways, one
above the other, are suspended from vertical rods attached to the ceiling of a
high hotel lobby, Fig. 9–27a. The original design called for single rods 14 m long,
but when such long rods proved to be unwieldy to install, it was decided to replace
each long rod with two shorter ones as shown schematically in Fig. 9–27b.
Determine the net force exerted by the rods on the supporting pin A (assumed to
be the same size) for each design. Assume each vertical rod supports a mass m
of each bridge.
RESPONSE The single long vertical rod in Fig. 9–27a exerts an upward force
