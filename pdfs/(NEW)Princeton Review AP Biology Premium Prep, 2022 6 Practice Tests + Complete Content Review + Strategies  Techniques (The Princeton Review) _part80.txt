ets added to the protein. It could
also make the chain shorter if it changes to a stop codon.
(b) Given what is known about the neuraminidase enzyme, describe what is measured to provide the results in
Figure 2 and Figure 3.
The neuraminidase enzyme cleaves a tether that holds the viral particle to the membrane. To measure the
“neuraminidase activity” for Figure 2 and Figure 3, the cleavage action of the enzyme must be measured.
(c) Will an NAH virus with an N234Y substitution be a rapid spreading or slow spreading virus?
It will be a slow spreading virus.
(d) Justify your prediction.
The N234Y causes the enzyme activity to decrease, and this would mean that the viral particles do not get
released. This means that the virus should not spread quickly. NAH has high enzyme activity and spreads quickly, but
the N234Y version should not spread quickly.
Question 4
(a) Identify which cellular process thylakoids are associated with.
Thylakoids are associated with photosynthesis.
(b) Explain wh
