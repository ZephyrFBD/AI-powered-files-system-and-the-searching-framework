rature. As an example, the solubility of N2 gas in water at 25 °C and 
0.78 atm pressure is 4.75 * 10-4 M. The Henry’s law constant for N2 in 25 °C water is 
thus 14.75 * 10-4 mol>L2>0.78 atm = 6.1 * 10-4 mol>L@atm. If the partial pressure 
of N2 is doubled, Henry’s law predicts that the solubility in water at 25 °C also doubles 
to 9.50 * 10-4 M.
Bottlers use the effect of pressure on solubility in producing carbonated bever-
ages, which are bottled under a carbon dioxide pressure greater than 1 atm. When 
the bottles are opened to the air, the partial pressure of CO2 above the solution 
decreases. Hence, the solubility of CO2 decreases, and CO21g2 escapes from the solu-
tion as bubbles (Figure 13.14).
