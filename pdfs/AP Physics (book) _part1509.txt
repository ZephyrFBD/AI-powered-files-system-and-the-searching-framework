s from a hot object to a cooler one, it is energy
that is being transferred from the hot to the cold object. Thus, heat is energy
transferred from one object to another because of a difference in temperature. In
SI units, the unit for heat, as for any form of energy, is the joule. Nonetheless,
calories and kcal are still sometimes used. Today the calorie is defined in terms 
of the joule (via the mechanical equivalent of heat, above), rather than in terms of
the properties of water, as given previously. The latter is still handy to remember:
1 cal raises 1 g of water by 1 C°, or 1 kcal raises 1 kg of water by 1 C°.
 
4.186 kJ = 1 kcal.
 
4.186 J = 1 cal;
1 Btu = 0.252 kcal = 1056 J.
