8 K, it is always a positive number. We 
can predict the sign of ∆S° by looking at the reaction.
Solve
(a) The reactants are six molecules of gas, and the products are 
three molecules of gas and four molecules of liquid. Thus,  
the number of molecules of gas has decreased signiﬁcantly 
during the reaction. By using the general rules discussed in  
Section 19.3, we expect a decrease in the number of gas mol-
ecules to lead to a decrease in the entropy of the system—the 
products have fewer possible microstates than the reactants. 
We therefore expect ∆S° and T∆S° to be negative. Because we 
are subtracting T∆S°, which is a negative number, we predict 
that ∆G° is less negative than ∆H°.
(b) Using Equation 19.14 and values from Appendix C, we have
 ∆G° = 3 ∆Gf°3CO21g24 + 4 ∆Gf°3H2O1l24
- ∆Gf°3C3H81g24 - 5 ∆Gf°3O21g24
 = 3 mol1-394.4 kJ>mol2 + 4 mol1-237.13 kJ>mol2 -
1 mol1-23.47 kJ>mol2 - 5 mol10 kJ>mol2 = -2108 kJ 
Notice that we have been careful to use the value of ∆Gf° for 
H2O1l2.
