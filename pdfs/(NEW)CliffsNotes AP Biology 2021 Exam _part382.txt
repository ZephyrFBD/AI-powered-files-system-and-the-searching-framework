 in an entire polypeptide, or protein.
8. A. A deletion of a nucleotide in the mRNA produces a change in the triplet-codon reading frame and creates a
frameshift mutation. For example, if the first nucleotide of a codon is deleted, then its second nucleotide becomes its
first, its third nucleotide becomes its second, and the first nucleotide of the next codon becomes its third. This, then,
is repeated in every subsequent codon. Such an arrangement is likely to change many of the amino acids in the
sequence (depending upon where in the sequence the frameshift begins) and, thus, affect the final sequence of the
polypeptide considerably. Answer choice B will result in a missing amino acid, and answer choice C will very likely
change one amino acid to a different amino acid. These changes may alter the effectiveness of the polypeptide, but
not as severely as changing many amino acids, as would occur in answer choice A. Answer choice D may have no
effect at all because a change in the third
