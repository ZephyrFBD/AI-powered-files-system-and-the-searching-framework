Question 3
a. In mitochondrial inheritance the offspring have the genotype and phenotype of the mother. Under Mendelian
inheritance it is possible for the offspring to have a different genotype but the same phenotype as the mother.
Describe how this is possible.
It is possible for a mother and offspring to have a different genotype and the same phenotype under classic
Mendelian inheritance because there are more than one genotype that have the same phenotype. For example, a
homozygous dominant and a heterozygous genotype will both have the dominant phenotype.
b. Explain what important control(s) the scientists should do to account for the procedure in Step 2.
It would be important to make sure the injection process itself is not causing a problem. There should be a control
group of wild-type cells that is injected with saline to account for the injection and make sure it is the actual
mitochondria that is causing the mutant phenotype.
c. If the nuclear DNA was inj
