862. Darwin’s journey, like Wallace’s later
journeys to the Malay Archipelago, included stops at several island chains, the last being the Galápagos Islands west of
Ecuador. On these islands, Darwin observed species of organisms on different islands that were clearly similar, yet had
distinct differences. For example, the ground finches inhabiting the Galápagos Islands comprised several species with
a unique beak shape (Figure 18.2). The species on the islands had a graded series of beak sizes and shapes with very
small differences between the most similar. He observed that these finches closely resembled another finch species on the
mainland of South America. Darwin imagined that the island species might be species modified from one of the original
mainland species. Upon further study, he realized that the varied beaks of each finch helped the birds acquire a specific
type of food. For example, seed-eating finches had stronger, thicker beaks for breaking seeds, and insect-eating finch
