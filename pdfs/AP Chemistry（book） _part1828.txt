the six-carbon molecule to the ten-carbon molecule.  
(a) The eight-carbon hydrocarbon, octane, has an isomer, 
isooctane. Would you predict that isooctane would have 
a larger or smaller viscosity than octane? Why? (b) Predict 
the relative order of boiling points of the hydrocarbons in 
Table 11.4, from lowest to highest. (c) The surface tension of

the hydrocarbon liquids in Table 11.4 does increase from 
hexane to decane, but only by a rather small amount (20% 
overall, compared to the doubling of viscosity). Which of 
the statements below is the most likely explanation for 
this phenomenon? (i) The ï¬‚exibility of the molecules has 
a much larger effect on viscosity than on surface tension.  
(ii) Viscosity only depends on molecular weight, but sur-
face tension depends on molecular weight and on inter-
molecular forces. (iii) Larger molecules can make larger 
liquid droplets and therefore have lo
