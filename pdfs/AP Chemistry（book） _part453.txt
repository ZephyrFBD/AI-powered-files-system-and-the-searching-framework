 masses of CO2 and H2O we 
can calculate the number of moles of C and H in the original sample and thereby the 
empirical formula. If a third element is present in the compound, its mass can be deter-
mined by subtracting the measured masses of C and H from the original sample mass.
 
Sample Exercise 3.15
Determining an Empirical Formula by Combustion Analysis
Isopropyl alcohol, sold as rubbing alcohol, is composed of C, H, and O. Combustion of 0.255 g of isopropyl alcohol produces 
0.561 g of CO2 and 0.306 g of H2O. Determine the empirical  
formula of isopropyl alcohol.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are told that isopropyl alcohol contains C, H, and O at-
oms and are given the quantities of CO2 and H2O produced when 
a given quantity of the alcohol is combusted. We must determine 
the empirical formula for isopropyl alcohol, a task that requires us 
to calculate the number of moles of C, H, and O in the sample.
Plan We can use the mole concept to calculate grams of C in the CO2 
and grams of H
