ce (B) is incorrect
because DNA replication only occurs once in meiosis, and there are two rounds of cell division in meiosis.
Choice (D) is incorrect because DNA replication only occurs once in meiosis.
6. (A) Genes that are close together on the same chromosome have fewer opportunities for recombination than
genes that are farther apart on the same chromosome. Thus, recombination events between genes that are close
together on the same chromosome occur less frequently than recombination events between genes that are
farther apart on the same chromosome. Choice (B) is the opposite of the correct answer. The distance between
genes does affect the frequency of recombination events, so choice (C) cannot be the answer. Typically,
recombination events do occur between genes on the same chromosome, so choice (D) is not correct.
7. (C) Mitosis produces somatic (body) cells, whereas meiosis produces gametes. Choice (A) is incorrect because
mitosis produces two cells whereas meiosis produces f
