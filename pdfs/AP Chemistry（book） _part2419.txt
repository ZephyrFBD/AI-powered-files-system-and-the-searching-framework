ubstitute the starting con-
centrations into the equilibrium-constant expression to calculate 
the reaction quotient, Q c. Comparing the magnitudes of the equi-
librium constant, which is given, and the reaction quotient will 
tell us in which direction the reaction will proceed.
Solve 
The initial concentrations are
 
 3HI4 = 2.0 * 10-2 mol>2.00 L = 1.0 * 10-2 M
 3H24 = 1.0 * 10-2 mol>2.00 L = 5.0 * 10-3 M
  3I24 = 3.0 * 10-2 mol>2.00 L = 1.5 * 10-2 M
The reaction quotient is therefore
Q c =
3HI42
3H243I24 =
11.0 * 10-222
15.0 * 10-3211.5 * 10-22
= 1.3
Because Q c 6 Kc, the concentration of HI must increase and the 
concentrations of H2 and I2 must decrease to reach equilibrium; 
the reaction as written proceeds left to right to attain equilibrium.
