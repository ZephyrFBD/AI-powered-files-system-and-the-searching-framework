ike.‚Äù Nonpolar substances are 
more likely to be soluble in nonpolar solvents; ionic and polar solutes are more likely to 
be soluble in polar solvents. Network solids such as diamond and quartz are not soluble in 
either polar or nonpolar solvents because of the strong bonding within the solid.
Give It Some Thought
Suppose the hydrogens on the OH groups in glucose (Figure 13.10) were replaced 
with methyl groups, CH3. Would you expect the water solubility of the resulting 
molecule to be higher than, lower than, or about the same as glucose?
Predict whether each of the following substances is more likely to dissolve in the nonpolar solvent carbon tetrachloride 1CCl42 or 
in water: C7H16, Na2SO4, HCl, and I2.
Sample Exercise 13.1 
Predicting Solubility Patterns
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given two solvents, one that is nonpolar 1CCl42 
and the other that is polar 1H2O2, and asked to determine which 
will be the better solvent for each solute listed.
