The equilibrium-constant expression is:
Ka =

=
1x21x2
0.10 - x = 6.8 * 10-4
When we try solving this equation using the approximation 
0.10 - x â‰ƒ0.10 (that is, by neglecting the concentration of 
acid that ionizes), we obtain:
x = 8.2 * 10-3 M
Because this approximation is greater than 5% of 0.10 M, how-
ever, we should work the problem in standard quadratic form. 
Rearranging, we have:
 x2 = 10.10 - x216.8 * 10-42
 = 6.8 * 10-5 - 16.8 * 10-42x
x2 + 16.8 * 10-42x - 6.8 * 10-5 = 0
Substituting these values in the standard quadratic formula 
gives:
x =
-6.8 * 10-4 { 216.8 * 10-422 - 41-6.8 * 10-52

= -6.8 * 10-4 { 1.6 * 10-2

Of the two solutions, only the positive value for x is chemically 
reasonable. From that value, we can determine 3H+4 and hence 
the pH:
x = 3H+4 = 3F-4 = 7.9 * 10-3 M, so pH = -log3H+4 = 2.10
From our result, we can calculate the percent of molecules ionized:
Percent ionization of HF = concentration ionized
