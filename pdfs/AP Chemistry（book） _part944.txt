e plots are noteworthy: the 
number of peaks, the number of points at which the probability function goes to zero (called 
nodes), and how spread out the distribution is, which gives a sense of the size of the orbital.
For the 1s orbital, we see that the probability rises rapidly as we move away from the 
nucleus, maximizing at about 0.5 Å. Thus, when the electron occupies the 1s orbital, it 
is most likely to be found this distance from the nucleus*—we still use the probabilistic 
description, consistent with the uncertainty principle. Notice also that in the 1s orbital 
the probability of finding the electron at a distance greater than about 3 Å from the 
nucleus is essentially zero.
*In the quantum-mechanical model, the most probable distance at which to find the electron in 
the 1s orbital is actually 0.529 Å, the same as the radius of the orbit predicted by Bohr for n = 1. 
The distance 0.529 Å is often called the Bohr radius.
