ies that is the outgroup on this cladogram.
(b) Describe the similarities and differences in the characteristics present in species B and species D.
(c) A new species (X) is discovered, which has body segmentation, antennae, and fur but does not have eyes or
scales. Construct a line that represents the ancestry of species X on the cladogram.
(d) Explain why species C is placed off of the same branch as species B and not the same branch as species D.
12. Two species of ground squirrels are separated by a river that they cannot cross. Genetic analyses of the two
species of ground squirrels indicate that 99.3% of their DNA is homologous.
(a) Describe the type of reproductive isolation that separates the two species of ground squirrels.
(b) Explain how homology in DNA is used to determine ancestry.
(c) Due to a severe drought, the decision is made to divert water away from the river to a reservoir that
supplies water for a nearby city, and the river separating the two species dries up. Pre
