d 9.21. Using species such as acetic acid and ammo-
nia as models, suggest the origin of the two pKa values. 
 
(c) Glutamic acid is an amino acid that has three 
pKa>s: 2.10, 4.07, and 9.47. Draw the structure of glutamic 
acid, and assign each pKa to the appropriate part of the 
molecule. (d) An unknown amino acid is titrated with 
strong base, producing the following titration curve.

 (a) Does the native form have a lower or higher free 
energy than the denatured form, in which the protein is 
an extended chain? (b) What is the sign of the system’s 
entropy change in going from the denatured to the 
folded form? (c) In the native form, the molecule has 
 
four ¬ S ¬ S ¬  bonds that bridge parts of
