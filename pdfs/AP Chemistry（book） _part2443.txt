d) If the volume is increased, the system will shift in the direc-
tion that occupies a larger volume (more gas molecules); thus, 
the equilibrium shifts to the right.
(e) The reaction is endothermic, so we can imagine heat as a 
reagent on the reactant side of the equation. Decreasing the 
temperature will shift the equilibrium in the direction that 
produces heat, so the equilibrium shifts to the left, toward the 
formation of more N2O4. Note that only this last change also 
affects the value of the equilibrium constant, K.

4 NO1g2 + 6 H2O1g2 ∆H° = -904 kJ
which of the following changes will shift the equilibrium to 
the right, toward the formation of more products?  
(a) Adding more water vapor (b) Increasing the temperature 
(c) Increasing the volume of the reaction vessel (d) Removing 
O21g2 (e) Adding 1 atm of Ne(g) to the reaction vessel.
