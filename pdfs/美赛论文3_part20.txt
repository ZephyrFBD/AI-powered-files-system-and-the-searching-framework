ng this stage, the speed of
draining away water will increase as the hot water is added into the bathtub
continuously.
(2) Immediately, the speed of draining away water keeps stable. During this stage, the
speed of draining away water is the same as the speed of adding hot water into the
bathtub.
(3) Finally, the person stops adding hot water into the bathtub. The speed of draining
away water decreases from the stable number to zero. During this stage, although
no more water will be added into the bathtub, the liquid level is still a little higher
than the height where the overflow drain is. Hence, the process of draining away
water is still going on and will finally decrease to zero.

From the picture above, the time of the first stage and the final stage is very short,
so we can approximatively regard that draining away the water goes on at the same
time as adding the water and the speed of draining away the water is always the same
as
