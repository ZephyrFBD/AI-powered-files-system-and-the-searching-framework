ation, produces ethanol 
1C2H5OH2 and CO2. (a) Using data given in Appendix C, 
 
compare the equilibrium constants for the following 
reactions:
C6H12O61s2 + 6 O21g2 ∆6 CO21g2 + 6 H2O1l2
C6H12O61s2 ∆2 C2H5OH1l2 + 2 CO21g2
(b) Compare the maximum work that can be obtained from 
these processes under standard conditions.

The conversion of natural gas, which is mostly methane, 
into products that contain two or more carbon atoms, such 
as ethane 1C2H62, is a very important industrial chemical 
process. In principle, methane can be converted into eth-
ane and hydrogen:
2 CH41g2 ¡ C2H61g2 + H21g2
In practice, this reaction is carried out in the presence of 
oxygen:
2 CH41g2 + 1
2 O21g2 ¡ C2H61g2 + H2O1g2
(a) Using the data in Appendix C, calculate K for these re-
actions at 25 °C and 500 °C. (b) Is the difference in ∆G° for 
the two reactions due primarily to the enthalpy term 1∆H2 
or the entropy term 1-T∆S2? (c) Explain how the preced-
ing reactions are an example of driving
