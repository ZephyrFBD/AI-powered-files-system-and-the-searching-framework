cking. 
Step 2 Carefully insert a small plug of absorbent cotton into the barrel of the 
microrespirometers, all the way into the 0 mL or cc mark. You can pack this cotton to the 
end with the barrel of a clean thin-stem pipette. (See Figure 4.)

Step 3 Add one small drop of 15% KOH (or NaOH, Drano) to the cotton in the 
microrespirometers. Do not add too much! CAUTION: Make sure you are wearing 
gloves and safety goggles to protect your eyes because KOH is caustic. 
Step 4 Add a small plug of nonabsorbent cotton on top of the absorbent cotton plug 
already inside the barrel of the microrespirometers. You can pack the cotton to the end 
with the barrel of a clean thin-stem pipette. (This nonabsorbent plug is needed to protect 
the seeds from the caustic KOH.) 
Step 5 Slowly reinsert the syringe plunger. CAUTION: Be sure to point the capillary 
tip into a sink or container. There may be excess KOH in the syringe that might squirt
