If a positively charged object is brought close to the knob, a separation of charge
is induced: electrons are attracted up into the knob, and the leaves become posi-
tively charged, Fig.16–11a. The two leaves repel each other as shown, because they
are both positively charged. If, instead, the knob is charged by conduction
(touching), the whole apparatus acquires a net charge as shown in Fig. 16–11b.
In either case, the greater the amount of charge, the greater the separation of 
the leaves.
Note that you cannot tell the sign of the charge in this way, since negative
charge will cause the leaves to separate just as much as an equal amount of 
positive charge; in either case, the two leaves repel each other. An electroscope
can, however, be used to determine the sign of the charge if it is first charged by
conduction: say, negatively, as in Fig. 16–12a. Now if a negative object is brought
close, as in Fig. 16–12b, more electrons are induced to move down into the leaves
and they s
