se gravity is so strong that even
light cannot escape them. In addition, there is electromagnetic radiation that
reaches the Earth but does not come from the bright pointlike objects we call stars:
particularly important is the microwave background radiation that arrives nearly
uniformly from all directions in the universe.
Finally, there are active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are very luminous point-
like sources of light in the centers of distant galaxies. The most dramatic examples
of AGN are quasars (“quasistellar objects” or QSOs), which are so luminous that
the surrounding starlight of the galaxy is drowned out. Their luminosity is
thought to come from matter falling into a giant black hole at a galaxy’s center.

Death of Stars, Nucleosynthesis
The stars appear unchanging. Night after night the night sky reveals no significant
variations. Indeed, on a human time scale, the vast majority of stars change very
little (except for novae, supernovae, a
