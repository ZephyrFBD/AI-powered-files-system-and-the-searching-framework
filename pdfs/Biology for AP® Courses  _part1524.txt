e 5' to 3' direction. DNA polymerase recognizes the 3'-OH end as its landing site; thus,
polymerase “reads” the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction and builds the complementary DNA polymer in the 5' to 3'
direction. One strand—called the leading strand—is synthesized continuously in the direction of the replication fork (the
direction in which helicase is separating the two strands), with polymerase adding new nucleotides one-by-one. However,

replication of the other strand—called the lagging strand—occurs in a direction away from the replication fork, in short
stretches of DNA known as Okazaki fragments. (Think of the activities on the lagging strand as analogous to trying to walk
on a moving sidewalk that is moving in the opposite direction.) The RNA primers are replaced by DNA nucleotides, and
ligase seals the DNA, creating phosphodiester bonds between th
