analysis and Ohm’s law (Chapters 18 and 19).
SOLUTION The voltage drop across the resistor is
so
R = VI = (3.3 V)A1.5 * 10–2 AB = 220 .
4.0 V - 0.7 V = 3.3 V,

†At room temperature, the reverse current is a few pA in Si; but it increases rapidly with temperature,
and may render a diode ineffective above 200°C.

If the voltage across a diode connected in reverse bias is increased greatly,
breakdown occurs. The electric field across the junction becomes so large that
ionization of atoms results. The electrons thus pulled off their atoms contribute
to a larger and larger current as breakdown continues. The voltage remains con-
stant over a wide range of currents. This is shown on the far left in Fig. 29–30.
