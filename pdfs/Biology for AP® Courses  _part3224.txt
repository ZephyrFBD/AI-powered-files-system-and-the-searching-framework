is not involved in hearing. Instead, an animal’s vestibular system detects its own movement, both linear
and angular acceleration and deceleration, and balance.
Sound
Auditory stimuli are sound waves, which are mechanical, pressure waves that move through a medium, such as air or water.
There are no sound waves in a vacuum since there are no air molecules to move in waves. The speed of sound waves differs,
based on altitude, temperature, and medium, but at sea level and a temperature of 20º C (68º F), sound waves travel in the
air at about 343 meters per second.
As is true for all waves, there are four main characteristics of a sound wave: frequency, wavelength, period, and amplitude.
Frequency is the number of waves per unit of time, and in sound is heard as pitch. High-frequency (≥15.000Hz) sounds
are higher-pitched (short wavelength) than low-frequency (long wavelengths; ≤100Hz) sounds. Frequency is measured in
cycles per second, and for sound, the most commonly used unit is hertz (
