Questions 7 and 8 refer to the following scenario.
A cruise ship with 500 people on board crashes on a deserted island. They like the island so much that they decide to
stay. There is a small number of people on board with red hair, an autosomal recessive trait. Assume that red hair
provides no increase in fitness.
7. What is most likely to occur with respect to the number of red-haired individuals on the island?
(A) There will be no change in the overall number of red-haired people in the population over time.
(B) Convergent evolution will occur, with all people eventually becoming red-haired.
(C) It is likely that over many generations, the proportion of red-haired people in the population will increase.
(D) Red-haired people will probably decrease in the population over many generations.
8. Evolution does not occur when a population is said to be in equilibrium by the Hardy-Weinberg definition. In
the situation above, which of the following does NOT support the cla
