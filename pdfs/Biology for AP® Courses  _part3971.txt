antigens that occur after tissue sensitization
are termed hypersensitivities. The types of hypersensitivities include immediate, delayed, and autoimmunity. A large
proportion of the population is affected by one or more types of hypersensitivity.
Allergies
The immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response
occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy. In the United States, 20 percent of the
population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma, whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens. Upon
initial exposure to a potential allergen, an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies of the IgE class via the typical process of
APCs presenting processed antigen to TH cells that stimulate B cells to produce IgE. This class of antibodies also mediates
the immune response to parasitic worms. The constant domain of the IgE molecules interact with mast cells embedded
in connective tissues
