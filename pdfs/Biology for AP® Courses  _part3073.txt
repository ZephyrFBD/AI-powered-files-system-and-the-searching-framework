en multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic
neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential. This process is called summation and occurs at the axon
hillock, as illustrated in Figure 26.16. Additionally, one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons—some
excitatory and some inhibitory—so IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa. It is the net change in postsynaptic
membrane voltage that determines whether the postsynaptic cell has reached its threshold of excitation needed to fire an
action potential. Together, synaptic summation and the threshold for excitation act as a filter so that random “noise” in the
system is not transmitted as important information.

Figure 26.16 A single neuron can receive both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from multiple neurons, resulting in local
membrane depolarization (EPSP input) and hyperpolarization (IPSP input). All these inputs are add
