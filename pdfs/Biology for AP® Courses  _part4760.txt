remain viable.
b.
The ground is permanently frozen, so the seeds will be kept at 10°C even if the electricity fails.
c.
Because such a climate extends the dormancy periods of seeds to more than what is normal.
d.
Because the ground is permanently frozen, the seeds will be kept below 0°C even if electricity fails.
Crop success is largely dependent on the quality of the soil. Although some agricultural soils are rendered sterile using
controversial cultivation and chemical treatments, most contain a huge diversity of organisms that maintain nutrient
cycles—breaking down organic matter into nutrient compounds that crops need for growth. These organisms also maintain
soil texture that affects water and oxygen dynamics in the soil that are necessary for plant growth. If farmers had to maintain
arable soil using alternate means, the cost of food would be much higher than it is now. These kinds of processes are called
ecosystem services. They occur within ecosystems, such as soil ecosystems,
