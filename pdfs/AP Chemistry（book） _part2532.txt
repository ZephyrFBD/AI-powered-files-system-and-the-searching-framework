ution 3H+4 is greater than 1.0 * 10-7 M; in a basic 
solution 3H+4 is less than 1.0 * 10-7 M.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
In a certain acidic solution at 25 °C, 3H+4 is 100 times greater 
than 3OH -4. What is the value for 3OH -4 for the solution?
(a) 1.0 * 10-8 M (b) 1.0 * 10-7 M (c) 1.0 * 10-6 M 
(d) 1.0 * 10-2 M (e) 1.0 * 10-9 M
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Indicate whether solutions with each of the following ion 
concentrations are neutral, acidic, or basic at 25 °C:  
(a) 3H+4 = 4 * 10-9 M; (b) 3OH -4 = 1 * 10-7 M;  
(c) 3OH -4 = 1 * 10-13 M.

CHAPTER 16 Acid–Base Equilibria
What makes Equation 16.16 particularly useful is that it is applicable both to pure water 
and to any aqueous solution. Although the equilibrium between H+1aq2 and OH -1aq2 as 
well as other ionic equilibria are affected somewhat by the presence of additional ions in 
solution, it is customary to ignore these ionic effects except in work requiring exceptional 
accuracy. Thus, Equation 16.16 is taken to be valid for
