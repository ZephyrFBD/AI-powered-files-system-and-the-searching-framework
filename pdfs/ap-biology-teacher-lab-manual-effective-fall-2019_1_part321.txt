er potential of the 
solution surrounding the cell decreases. If enough solute is added, the water potential 
outside the cell is equal to the water potential inside the cell, and there will be no net 
movement of water. However, the solute concentrations inside and outside the cell are 
not equal, because the water potential inside the cell results from the combination of 
both the turgor pressure (ψP) and the solute pressure (ψS). (See Figure 2.) 
Figure 2. Plant cell in an aqueous solution. The water potential of the cell equals that of 
surrounding solution at dynamic equilibrium. The cell’s water potential equals the sum of 
the turgor pressure potential plus the solute potential. The solute potentials of the solution 
and of the cell are not equal. 
If more solute is added to the water surrounding the cell, water will leave the cell, 
moving from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential. The 
water loss causes the cell to lose turgor. A continued loss
