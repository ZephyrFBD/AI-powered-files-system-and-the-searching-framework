ing-shaped iron core around which the wire was wrapped.
Faraday hoped that a strong steady current in X would produce a great enough mag-
netic field to produce a current in a second coil Y wrapped on the same iron ring.

This second circuit, Y, contained a galvanometer to detect any current but contained
no battery. He met no success with constant currents. But the long-sought effect was
finally observed when Faraday noticed the galvanometer in circuit Y deflect strongly
at the moment he closed the switch in circuit X. And the galvanometer deflected
strongly in the opposite direction when he opened the switch in X. A constant
current in X produced a constant magnetic field which produced no current in Y.
Only when the current in X was starting or stopping was a current produced in Y.
Faraday concluded that although a constant magnetic field produces no current
in a conductor, a changing magnetic field can produce an electric
