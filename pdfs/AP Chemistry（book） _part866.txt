e that all this carbon is converted into glu-
cose. (a) Calculate the energy stored by photosynthesis on 
land per year, in kJ. (b) Calculate the average rate of conver-
sion of solar energy into plant energy in megawatts, MW 
11W = 1 J>s2. A large nuclear power plant produces about 
103 MW. The energy of how many such nuclear power plants 
is equivalent to the solar energy conversion?

 (a) By using data in Appendix C, calculate ∆H° for each of 
the reactions. (b) As we saw in Section 4.3, nitric acid and 
hydrochloric acid are strong acids. Write net ionic equations 
for the neutralization of these acids. (c) Compare the values 
of ∆H° for the first two reactions. What can you conclude? 
 
(d) In the third equation NH4
+1aq2 is acting as an acid. Based 
on the value of ∆H° for this reaction, do you think it is a 
strong or a weak acid? Explain.
