 variety of antibiotics, making it difficult to treat. The use of
bacteriophages specific for such bacteria would bypass their resistance to antibiotics and specifically kill
them. Although phage therapy is in use in the Republic of Georgia to treat antibiotic-resistant bacteria,
its use to treat human diseases has not been approved in most countries. However, the safety of the
treatment was confirmed in the United States when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved
spraying meats with bacteriophages to destroy the food pathogen Listeria. As more and more antibiotic-
resistant strains of bacteria evolve, the use of bacteriophages might be a potential solution to the problem,
and the development of phage therapy is of much interest to researchers worldwide.
