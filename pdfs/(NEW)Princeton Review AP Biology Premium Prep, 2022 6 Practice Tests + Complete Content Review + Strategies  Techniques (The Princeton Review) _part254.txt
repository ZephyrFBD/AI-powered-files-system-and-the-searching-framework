8. The biggest difference between an enzyme-catalyzed reaction and an uncatalyzed reaction is that
(A) the free energy between the reactants and the products does not change

9. Two groups of cells were grown under identical conditions. Mitochondria from each group were isolated and
half of them were placed in a low pH (approximately pH 6.8) and the other half were placed in a neutral pH.
Small molecules were allowed to diffuse across the outer membrane via facilitated diffusion. Both samples
were expo
