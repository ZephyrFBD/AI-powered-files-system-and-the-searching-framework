or example, we saw in Figure 16.18 that a water molecule in 
3Fe(H2O)643+(aq) can be deprotonated to yield 3Fe(H2O)5OH42+(aq) and H+(aq). The 
iron ion retains its oxidation state; the coordinated hydroxide ligand, with a 1- charge, 
reduces the complex charge to 2+. Ligands can also be displaced from the coordination 
sphere by other ligands, if the incoming ligands bind more strongly to the metal ion 
than the original ones. For example, ligands such as NH3, NCS-, and CN- can replace 
H2O in the coordination sphere of metal ions.
Charges, Coordination Numbers, and Geometries
The charge of a complex is the sum of the charges on the metal and on the ligands. In 
3Cu(NH3)44SO4 we can deduce the charge on the complex ion because we know that the 
charge of the sulfate ion is 2-. Because the compound is electrically neutral, the complex 
ion must have a 2+ charge, 3Cu(NH3)442+. We can then use the charge of the complex ion 
to deduce the oxidation number of copper. Because the NH3 ligands
