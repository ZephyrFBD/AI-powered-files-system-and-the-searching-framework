ver. The phenotypic ratios for linked genes,
accordingly, will diﬀer from those based on Mendelian inheritance.
Sex-linked traits also do not follow ratios predicted by Mendel’s laws.
Determined by genes on sex chromosomes (X and Y), sex-linked traits
oȇen appear more frequently in one sex (females are XX and males are
XY). Since the Y chromosome in mammals and flies is small and carries
few genes, X-linked recessive traits, such as hemophilia, are always
expressed in males. The genotype of males for X-linked genes is called
hemizygous, because they only have one copy of genes exclusive to the X
chromosome. Sex-limited genes—though present in both sexes—are only
expressed in one sex, so the same genotype can result in the expression
of diﬀerent phenotypes. Milk production, for example, is expressed only

in female mammals, whereas pattern baldness is expressed exclusively in
human males.
Extranuclear inheritance is another example of non-Me
