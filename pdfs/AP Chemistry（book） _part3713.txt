ion is at 680 nm). What is the color of the complex ion?
Sample Exercise 23.6 
Relating Color Absorbed to Color Observed
SOLUTION
Analyze We need to relate the color absorbed by a complex (red) to 
the color observed for the complex.
Plan For an object that absorbs only one color from the visible 
spectrum, the color we see is complementary to the color ab-
sorbed. We can use the color wheel of Figure 23.25 to determine 
the complementary color.
Solve From Figure 23.25, we see that green is complementary to 
red, so the complex appears green.
Comment As noted in Section 23.2, this green complex was one 
of those that helped Werner establish his theory of coordina-
tion (Table 23.3). The other geometric isomer of this complex, 
cis@3Co(NH3)4Cl24+, absorbs yellow light and therefore appears 
violet.
