Misleading Appearances
Some organisms may be very closely related, even though a minor genetic change caused a major morphological difference
to make them look quite different. Similarly, unrelated organisms may be distantly related, but appear very much alike. This
usually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions.
When similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship,
it is called an analogy or homoplasy. For example, insects use wings to fly like bats and birds, but the wing structure and
embryonic origin is completely different. These are called analogous structures (Figure 20.8).
Similar traits can be either homologous or analogous. Homologous structures share a similar embryonic origin; analogous
organs have a similar function. For example, the bones in the front flipper of a whale are homologous to the bones in the
human arm. These struct
