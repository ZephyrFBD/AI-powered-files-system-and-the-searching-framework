endulum at some
angle 
relative to the vertical, and the forces on it:
downward, and the
tension 
in the cord (including its components). These forces do not add up
to zero if
and since we have an acceleration a, we expect
SOLUTION (a) The acceleration  
is horizontal  
, and the only
horizontal force is the x component of 
(Fig.4–25b). Then from Newton’s
second law,
The vertical component of Newton’s second law gives, since
,
So
Dividing these two equations, we obtain
or
so
(b) The velocity is constant, so  
and  
Hence the pendulum hangs
vertically
NOTE This simple device is an accelerometer—it can be used to determine
acceleration, by mesuring the angle .
