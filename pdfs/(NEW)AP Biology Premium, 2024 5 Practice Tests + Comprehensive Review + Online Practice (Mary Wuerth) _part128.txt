ould allow for the most efficient exchange
of materials with its environment. Agar blocks (containing bromothymol blue dye) are cut into three different
shapes to model three differently shaped cells. The agar blocks are then placed in a vinegar solution. As the
vinegar diffuses into the agar models, the acid in the vinegar will turn the bromothymol blue dye yellow. The
time required for each agar model to turn completely yellow is measured and is an indication of the efficiency
of movement of materials into the agar models. The shape, volume, and surface area of each agar block is
shown in the table.

(a) Describe the measurement that would best predict the efficiency of each agar blockâ€™s exchange of
materials with its environment. Calculate that measurement for each agar block.
(b) Identify the independent variable and the dependent variable in this experiment.
(c) Predict which cell would
