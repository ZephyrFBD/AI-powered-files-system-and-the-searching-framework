The following method of data collection is suggested for students, although others 
work as well. In this case, the disks floating are counted at the end of each time interval. 
The median is chosen over the mean as the summary statistic. For most student work, 
the median will generally provide a better estimate of the central tendency of the data 
because, on occasion, a disk fails to rise or takes a very long time to do so. Consequently, 
for this sample, the median time for five disks to rise is somewhere between 11 and 12 
minutes. A term coined by G. L Steucek and R. J Hill (1985) for this relationship is ET50, 
the estimated time for 50% of the disks to rise. That is, rate is a change in a variable over 
time. The time required for 50% of the leaf disks to float is represented as Effective Time 
= ET50. 
Figure 2 is a sample graph of a photosynthesis light response curve utilizing the ET50 
concept.
