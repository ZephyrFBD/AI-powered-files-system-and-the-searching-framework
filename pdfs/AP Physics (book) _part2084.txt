hemical reac-
tions in many cannot be reversed. In such cases, the arrangement of Fig. 19–14b
would simply waste energy.
Sources of emf can also be arranged in parallel, Fig. 19–14c, which—if the
emfs are the same—can provide more energy when large currents are needed.
Each of the cells in parallel has to produce only a fraction of the total current, so
the energy loss due to internal resistance is less than for a single cell; and the 
batteries will go dead less quickly.
20 V - 12 V = 8 V.

Jump starting a car. A good car battery is being used to
jump start a car with a weak battery. The good battery has an emf of 12.5 V and
internal resistance 
Suppose the weak battery has an emf of 10.1 V and
