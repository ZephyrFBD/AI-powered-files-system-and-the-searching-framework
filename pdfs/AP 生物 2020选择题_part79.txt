transport pyruvate.
(D) 
Correct. Pyruvate that cannot be broken down by the Krebs cycle will 
be further metabolized by fermentation.

Topic
2.C: Explain how biological 
concepts or processes 
represented visually relate to 
larger biological principles, 
concepts, processes or theories.
SYI-1.A: Explain how the 
properties of water that 
result from its polarity and 
hydrogen bonding affect its 
biological function.
Structure of 
Water and 
Hydrogen 
Bonding
(A) 
Incorrect. If the walls of xylem are nonpolar, polar water would not stick 
to them through adhesion.
(B) 
Incorrect. Water is a polar molecule, which explains why it can adhere 
to the polar surface of the xylem.
(C) 
Incorrect. Water and xylem are both polar and could form bonds with 
one another.
(D) 
Correct. Water has a high surface tension as a result of the hydrogen 
bonds that water molecules form between each other because both the 
xylem and the water are polar.
