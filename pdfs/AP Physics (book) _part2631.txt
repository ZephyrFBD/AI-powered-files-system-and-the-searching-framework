s, it
can serve as one means for distinguishing the nature of light.
Note, as shown in Fig. 24–2, that diffraction is most prominent when the size
of the opening is on the order of the wavelength of the wave. If the opening is
much larger than the wavelength, diffraction may go unnoticed.
Does light exhibit diffraction? In the mid-seventeenth century, the Jesuit
priest Francesco Grimaldi (1618–1663) had observed that when sunlight entered
a darkened room through a tiny hole in a screen, the spot on the opposite wall
was larger than would be expected from geometric rays. He also observed that
the border of the image was not clear but was surrounded by colored fringes.
Grimaldi attributed this to the diffraction of light.
The wave model of light nicely accounts for diffraction. But the ray model
(Chapter 23) cannot account for diffraction, and it is important to be aware of such
limitations to the ray model. Geometric optics using rays is successful in a wide
range of situations only bec
