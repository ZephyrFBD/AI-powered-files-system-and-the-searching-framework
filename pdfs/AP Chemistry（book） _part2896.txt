CHAPTER 18 Chemistry of the Environment
Much CO2 is absorbed into oceans or used by plants. Nevertheless, we are now gen-
erating CO2 much faster than it is being absorbed or used. Analysis of air trapped in ice 
cores taken from Antarctica and Greenland makes it possible to determine the atmo-
spheric levels of CO2 during the past 160,000 years. These measurements reveal that the 
level of CO2 remained fairly constant from the last Ice Age, some 10,000 years ago, until 
roughly the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, about 300 years ago. Since that time, 
the concentration of CO2 has increased by about 30% to a current high of about 400 
ppm (Figure 18.14). Climate scientists believe that the CO2 level has not been this high 
since 3 to 5 million years ago.
