nd the level of hyperpolarization have a direct relationship.
d. If the rods were bathed in fluid with a high sodium content, explain how the resting membrane potential would
change. How does the sodium change the resting membrane potential? (1 point)
If the sodium content were high in the fluid, it would make the resting membrane potential more positive/less
negative, perhaps â€“20mV. This is the opposite of what happened when the sodium was removed from the vitreous
humor. The cell would depolarize at rest because sodium is always flowing through the sodium channel and going into the
cell and the positive sodium ions make it less negative. When a light stimulus occurs, the channel closes and the cell
hyperpolarizes.
Question 2
a. Explain how biotic and abiotic factors affect where plants grow. (2 points)
Biotic factors are things that are alive, like plants and fungi and animals and bacteria. Some of these things
compete with the plants, but other things like certain types of fungi and
