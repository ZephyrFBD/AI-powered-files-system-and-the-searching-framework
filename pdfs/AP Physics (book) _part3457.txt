fissionable fuel
acts as the heat input for a heat engine (Chapter 15).
There are problems associated with nuclear power plants. Besides the usual
thermal pollution associated with any heat engine (Section 15–11), there is the
serious problem of disposal of the radioactive fission fragments produced in 
the reactor, plus radioactive nuclides produced by neutrons interacting with the
structural parts of the reactor. Fission fragments, like their uranium or plutonium
parents, have about 50% more neutrons than protons. Nuclei with atomic
number in the typical range for fission fragments 
are stable only
if they have more nearly equal numbers of protons and neutrons (see Fig. 30–2).
Hence the highly neutron-rich fission fragments are very unstable and decay
radioactively. The accidental release of highly radioactive fission fragments into
the atmosphere poses a serious threat to human health (Section 31–4), as does
possible leakage of the radioactive wastes when they are disposed of. The
