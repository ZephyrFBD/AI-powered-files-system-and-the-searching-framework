when you put some points on the graph. Every point on the graph represents both an
independent variable and a dependent variable.
Once you draw both axes and label the axes as x and y, you can plot the points on the graph. We’re just going to
look at (b), which asks us to design an experiment.
Enzymes are biological catalysts.
(b) Construct an experiment that investigates the influence of temperature, substrate concentration, or pH on
the activity of an enzyme.
Let’s set up a graph that shows the results of an experiment examining the relationship between pH and enzyme
activity. Notice that we’ve chosen only one factor here, pH. We could have chosen any of the three. Why did we
choose pH and not temperature or substrate concentration? Well, perhaps it’s the one we know the most about.
What is the independent variable? It is pH. In other words, pH is being manipulated in the experiment. We’ll
therefore label the x-axis with pH values from 0 through 14.
What is the dependent variable? It
