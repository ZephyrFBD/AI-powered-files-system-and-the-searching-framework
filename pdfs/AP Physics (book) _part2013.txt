 or device. Resistance is a
property of the wire or device.
The unit of resistance is the ohm

is equal to the product of current and voltage. That is, the power
transformed, measured in watts, is given by
(18–5)
which for resistors can be written as
(18–6)
The SI unit of power is the watt
The total electric energy transformed in any device equals
the product of the power and the time during which the device
is operated. In SI units, energy is given in joules
but electric companies use a larger unit, the kilowatt-hour
Electric current can be direct current (dc), in which the 
current is steady in one direction; or it can be alternating
current (ac), in which the current reverses direction at a particular
frequency f, typically 60 Hz. Alternating currents are typically
sinusoidal in time,

and are produced by an alternating voltage.
The rms values of sinusoidally alternating currents and
voltages are given by
