Developing Understanding
The cell is the basic unit of life. Cells contribute to the organization of life and provide the 
environment in which organelles function. Organelles in turn provide compartmentalization and 
organize cellular products for dispersal and waste for disposal. Cells have membranes that allow 
them to establish and maintain an internal environment. These membranes also control the 
exchange of material with the cell’s external environment—an important, foundational concept. 
The maintenance of the internal and external conditions of a cell is called homeostasis. Student 
understanding of these concepts will be necessary in later units when the focus of instruction 
shifts to cellular products and by-products and when students learn why cellular exchange of 
energy and materials matters.
