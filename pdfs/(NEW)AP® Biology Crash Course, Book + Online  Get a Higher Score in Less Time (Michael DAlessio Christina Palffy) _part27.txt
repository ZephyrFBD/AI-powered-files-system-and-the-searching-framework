Energy currency of the cell
Keep in mind that variations within these biological molecules allow for cells and organisms to
possess a much wider variety of functions, such as having different types of hemoglobin or different
phospholipids on a cell membrane.
Biologically important molecules are great examples of the “structure and function” theme. Be sure to use these examples in
essay questions to gain critical points. However, no specific structures of any monomers or polymers will be asked on the exam.
D. Enzymes—proteins that act as catalysts to speed up biochemical reactions.
1. The function of enzymes is to lower the activation energy of a reaction. This is the energy required
to initiate a chemical reaction.
2. The enzyme combines with the substrate or molecule that the enzyme will act upon. Th
