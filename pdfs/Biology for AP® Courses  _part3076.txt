to a toolâ€”such as a cursor on a computer screen. This means that a patient with ALS can
use e-mail, read the Internet, and communicate with others by thinking of moving his or her hand or arm
(even though the paralyzed patient cannot make that bodily movement). Recent advances have allowed a
paralyzed locked-in patient who suffered a stroke 15 years ago to control a robotic arm and even to feed
herself coffee using BCI technology.
Despite the amazing advancements in BCI technology, it also has limitations. The technology can require
many hours of training and long periods of intense concentration for the patient; it can also require brain
surgery to implant the devices.
Figure 26.17 With brain-computer interface technology, neural signals from a paralyzed patient are collected,
decoded, and then fed to a tool, such as a computer, a wheelchair, or a robotic arm.
