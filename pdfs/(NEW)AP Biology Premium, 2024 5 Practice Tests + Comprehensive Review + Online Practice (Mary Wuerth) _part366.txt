pts from the same gene, as shown in Figure 16.1. This alternative splicing
gives eukaryotes the ability to generate a greater variety of RNA transcripts from just one gene than what can
be generated from one gene in prokaryotes.

While introns do not code for amino acids, some introns may function in the regulation of gene expression.
2. To protect the 5′ end of the pre-mRNA transcript from degradation before it can be translated, a 5′ GTP cap
is added. Nuclear pores recognize this 5′ GTP cap and allow mRNAs with the cap to exit the nucleus. This
GTP cap also helps in the initiation of translation when the RNA reaches the ribosome.
3. The enzyme poly-A polymerase adds a string of adenine nucleotides to the 3′ end of the pre-mRNA transcript.
This 3′ poly-A tail helps prevent degradation of the transcript. mRNAs with longer 3′ poly-A tails tend to
have longer durations in the cytosol, which allows more copies of the protein (that the mRNA codes for) to
be
