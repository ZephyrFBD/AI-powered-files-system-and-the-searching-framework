for 4 minutes. 
3. Remove the slide from the Coplin jar containing 70% ethanol, dry with a scientific 
cleaning wipe, and label it. 
4. Place the onion tip on the slide, and cut off the distal 2 mm portion of the tip;  
discard the remainder of the tip. 
5. Cover the root tip piece with carbol-fuschin stain for 2 minutes. 
6. Blot off excess stain and cover tip with 1–2 drops of H2O. 
7. Gently separate the root tip apart with dissecting probes or needles. Place the cover 
slip over the root tip and cover the cover slip with a scientific cleaning wipe. 
8. Firmly press down on the cover slip with your thumb or with the eraser end of  
a pencil. Do not twist the slide. 
Counting Cells and Analyzing Data 
1. Observe the cells at high magnification (400–500 X). 
2. Look for well-stained, distinct cells. 
3. Within the field of view, count the cells in each phase. Repeat the counts in two other 
root tips. Identification of these stages is prerequisite knowledge. 
4. Collect the class data
