ential on side B. Since albumin cannot cross the
barrier in order to satisfy equilibrium, water will flow toward side B in order to dilute the solution. Choice (B)
correctly states that water will move from side A to side B, but it incorrectly explains the reason for the
movement of water in this direction. Choices (C) and (D) are incorrect because water will move from side A to
side B, not from side B to side A.
12. (A) Pepsin is found in the stomach, which has a pH of 2.5, so it is most likely to have its optimum activity at a
pH of 2.5. Choice (B) shows the optimum activity at a pH of 7.0, so it is incorrect based on the information in
the table. The graph in choice (C) shows the optimum activity at a basic pH of 10.0, so it is incorrect. Choice
(D) shows a constant rate of increasing enzyme activity as the pH increases, so it is also incorrect.
13. (A) According to the table, amylase is found in the mouth and pepsin is found in the stomach. So changing the
pH of those locations wou
