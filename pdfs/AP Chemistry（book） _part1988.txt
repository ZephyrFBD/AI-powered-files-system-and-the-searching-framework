12.34  Sodium metal (atomic weight 22.99 g>mol) adopts a 
body-centered cubic structure with a density of 0.97 g>cm3.
(a) Use this information and Avogadro’s number 
1NA = 6.022 * 1023/mol2 to estimate the atomic radius of 
sodium. (b) If sodium didn’t react so vigorously, it could 
float on water. Use the answer from part (a) to estimate 
the density of Na if its structure were that of a cubic close-
packed metal. Would it still float on water?
 12.35  Iridium crystallizes in a face-centered cubic unit cell that 
has an edge length of 3.833 Å. (a) Calculate the atomic
