s, new research has challenged scientists’ ideas about how organisms are related. New
models of these relationships have been proposed for consideration by the scientific community.
Many phylogenetic trees have been shown as models of the evolutionary relationship among species. Phylogenetic trees
originated with Charles Darwin, who sketched the first phylogenetic tree in 1837 (Figure 20.12a), which served as a pattern
for subsequent studies for more than a century. The concept of a phylogenetic tree with a single trunk representing a
common ancestor, with the branches representing the divergence of species from this ancestor, fits well with the structure
of many common trees, such as the oak (Figure 20.12b). However, evidence from modern DNA sequence analysis and
newly developed computer algorithms has caused skepticism about the validity of the standard tree model in the scientific
community.
