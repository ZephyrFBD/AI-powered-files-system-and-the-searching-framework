riety of mechanisms.
Science Practice
1.4: The student can use representations and models  
to analyze situations or solve problems qualitatively  
and quantitatively.
Learning Objective 
2.32: The student is able to use a graph or diagram to 
analyze situations or solve problems (quantitatively or 
qualitatively) that involve timing and coordination of 
events necessary for normal development in an organism.
(A)
This option is correct. The stem of the question indicates that cell 4 and  
cell 3 must be touching in order for cell 3 to induce formation of the intestine. 
This is the mechanism by which the correct timing of this developmental  
event occurs.
(B)
This option is incorrect because there is no indication that microvilli are formed.
(C)
This option is incorrect because there is no evidence of an electrical signal.
(D)
This option is incorrect because there is no indication that genetic material is 
transferred from cell 4 to cell 3, resulting in the development of intestinal
