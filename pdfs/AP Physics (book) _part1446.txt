Often a distinction is made between the terms “gas” and “vapor”: a substance
below its critical temperature in the gaseous state is called a vapor; above the
critical temperature, it is called a gas.
The behavior of a substance can be diagrammed not only on a PV diagram but
also on a PT diagram. A PT diagram, often called a phase diagram, is particu-
larly convenient for comparing the different phases of a substance. Figure 13–22
is the phase diagram for water. The curve labeled 
represents those points
where the liquid and vapor phases are in equilibrium—it is thus a graph of the 
boiling point versus pressure. Note that the curve correctly shows that at a pres-
sure of 1 atm the boiling point is 100°C and that the boiling point is lowered 
for a decreased pressure. The curve 
represents points where solid and liquid
exist in equilibrium and thus is a graph of the freezing point versus pressure.
