solid and assumed to
maintain their shape except for a small amount of elastic deformation. We
sometimes treated objects as point particles. Now we are going to shift our
attention to materials that are very deformable and can flow. Such “fluids” include
liquids and gases. We will examine fluids both at rest (fluid statics) and in motion
(fluid dynamics).

We start our study with fluids at rest, such as water in a glass or a lake. Pressure in a fluid
increases with depth, a fact that allows less dense objects to float—the pressure
underneath is higher than on top. When fluids flow, such as water or air, interesting
effects occur because the pressure in the fluid is lower where the fluid velocity is higher
(Bernoulli’s principle).
The great mass of a glacier’s ice (photos here) moves slowly, like a viscous liquid. The
dark lines are “moraines,” made up of rock broken off mountain walls by the moving ice,
and represent streamlines. The two
