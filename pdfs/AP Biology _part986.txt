 for the light-independent
reactions.
ATP and NADPH provide the power and raw materials for the
Calvin cycle.
Water entering the plant through the roots provides hydrogen
directly to the Calvin cycle.
CO2 released by the light-dependent reactions provides the raw
material for the Calvin cycle.
Below is an illustration that shows cyclic photophosphorylation in
the grana of plant cells:
Which of the following statements about this process is correct and
includes the right reasoning for why that statement is correct?

It is the opposite of cellular respiration because it releases
oxygen rather than utilizes it.
It is the opposite of the citric acid cycle because ATP is
utilized, not produced.
