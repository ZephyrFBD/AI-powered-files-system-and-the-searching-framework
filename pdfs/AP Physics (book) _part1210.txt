e cord simply appears to have segments that oscillate up and down in a fixed
pattern. The points of destructive interference, where the cord remains still at 
all times, are called nodes. Points of constructive interference, where the cord
oscillates with maximum amplitude, are called antinodes. The nodes and antinodes
remain in fixed positions for a particular frequency.
Standing waves can occur at more than one frequency. The lowest frequency
of oscillation that produces a standing wave gives rise to the pattern shown in 
Fig. 11–40a. The standing waves shown in Figs. 11–40b and 11–40c are produced
at precisely twice and three times the lowest frequency, respectively, assuming
the tension in the cord is the same. The cord can also oscillate with four loops
(four antinodes) at four times the lowest frequency, and so on.
The frequencies at which standing waves are produced are the natural
frequencies or resonant frequencies of the cord, and the different standing wave
patterns shown in
