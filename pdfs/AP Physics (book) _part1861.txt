From Fig. 17–12 we see that 
since
we can neglect 
in the denominator as compared to r. Then
we obtain

We see that the potential decreases as the square of the distance from the dipole,
whereas for a single point charge the potential decreases with the first power of
the distance (Eq. 17–5). It is not surprising that the potential should fall off faster
for a dipole: when you are far from a dipole, the two equal but opposite charges
appear so close together as to tend to neutralize each other.
The product 
in Eq. 17–6a is referred to as the dipole moment, p, of the
dipole. Equation 17–6a in terms of the dipole moment is
(17;6b)
A dipole moment has units of coulomb-meters 
although for molecules a
smaller unit called a debye is sometimes used:
In many molecules, even though they are electrically neutral, the electrons spend
more time in the vicinity of one atom than another, which results in a separation
of charge. Such molecules have a dipole moment and are called polar m
