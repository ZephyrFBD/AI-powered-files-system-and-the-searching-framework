 genes. The greater
the distance between two genes, the higher the chance that a recombination event will occur between them, and the higher
the recombination frequency between them. Two possibilities for recombination between two nonsister chromatids during

meiosis are shown in Figure 17.10. If the recombination frequency between two genes is less than 50 percent, they are said
to be linked.
Figure 17.10 Crossover may occur at different locations on the chromosome. Recombination between genes A and B
is more frequent than recombination between genes B and C because genes A and B are farther apart; a crossover is
therefore more likely to occur between them.
The generation of genetic maps requires markers, just as a road map requires landmarks (such as rivers and mountains).
Early genetic maps were based on the use of known genes as markers. More sophisticated mark
