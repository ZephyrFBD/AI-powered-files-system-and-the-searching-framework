onstant energy input to maintain organization, to grow and to
reproduce.
A species’ life history describes the series of events over its lifetime, such as how resources are allocated for growth,
maintenance, and reproduction. Life history traits affect the life table of an organism. A species’ life history is genetically
determined and shaped by the environment and natural selection.
Life History Patterns and Energy Budgets
Energy is required by all living organisms for their growth, maintenance, and reproduction; at the same time, energy is
often a major limiting factor in determining an organism’s survival. Plants, for example, acquire energy from the sun via
photosynthesis, but must expend this energy to grow, maintain health, and produce energy-rich seeds to produce the next
generation. Animals have the additional burden of using some of their energy reserves to acquire food. Furthermore, some
animals must expend energy caring for their offspring. Thus, all species have an energy b
