nergy. (We noted earlier that the reverse never happens: a stone never
absorbs thermal energy and rises into the air of its own accord.) This is another
example of order changing to disorder. Thermal energy is associated with the 
disorderly random motion of molecules, but the molecules in the falling stone all
have the same velocity downward in addition to their own random velocities.
Thus, the more orderly kinetic energy of the stone as a whole (which could do useful
work) is changed to disordered thermal energy when the stone strikes the ground.
Disorder increases in this process, as it does in all processes that occur in nature.
Biological Development
An interesting example of the increase in entropy relates to the biological devel-
opment and growth of organisms. Clearly, a human being is a highly ordered
organism. The development of an individual from a single cell to a grown person
is a process of increasing order. Evolution too might be seen as an increase in order.
