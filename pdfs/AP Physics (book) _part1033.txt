ass, a little water may leave the bottom of
the straw, thus increasing the volume of trapped air and reducing its density 
and pressure.)
Gauge Pressure
It is important to note that tire gauges, and most other pressure gauges, register the
pressure above and beyond atmospheric pressure. This is called gauge pressure.
Thus, to get the absolute pressure, P, we must add the atmospheric pressure,
to the gauge pressure,
If a tire gauge registers 220 kPa, the absolute pressure within the tire is
equivalent to about 3.2 atm (2.2 atm gauge
pressure).
220 kPa + 101 kPa = 321 kPa,
