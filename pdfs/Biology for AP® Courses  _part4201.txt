 measuring the aboveground
biomass per unit area, which is the total mass of living plants, excluding roots. This means that a large percentage of plant
biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement. Net primary productivity is an important variable
when considering differences in biomes. Very productive biomes have a high level of aboveground biomass.
Annual biomass production is directly related to the abiotic components of the environment. Environments with the greatest
amount of biomass have conditions in which photosynthesis, plant growth, and the resulting net primary productivity are
optimized. The climate of these areas is warm and wet. Photosynthesis can proceed at a high rate, enzymes can work
most efficiently, and stomata can remain open without the risk of excessive transpiration; together, these factors lead to the
maximal amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) moving into the plant, resulting in high biomass production. The aboveground
biomass produces seve
