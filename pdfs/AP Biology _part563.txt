rks its way through the food chain from that level to the highest
level. (ENE-3)
(D) Only about 10 percent of the energy from one trophic level is
transferred to the next level. The other choices do not make any
sense. (ENE-1)
(C) The existing circular shape would move up and to the left, thus
showing a warmer and drier climate. Choice A is not correct because
the circular shape is larger than that of the original and includes
cooler temperatures and greater precipitation. Choices B and D are
incorrect because they both show the circular shape moving to the
right, which would indicate greater precipitation. (SP 2)
(A) The amount of rainfall and the temperature are the most
important factors in the distribution of biomes. Furthermore, the
question described the steppes as “dry, cold grassland” so it makes
sense to look for an answer choice that includes both rainfall and
temperature. Choice B must be eliminated because it is irrelevant;
the amount of sunlight and the human population si
