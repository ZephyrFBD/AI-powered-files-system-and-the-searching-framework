ing it appear as though there is more than one layer, as seen in Figure 24.10. This is called pseudostratified, columnar
epithelia. This cellular covering has cilia at the apical, or free, surface of the cells. The cilia enhance the movement of
mucous and trapped particles out of the respiratory tract, helping to protect the system from invasive microorganisms and
harmful material that has been breathed into the body. Goblet cells are interspersed in some tissues (such as the lining of
the trachea). The goblet cells contain mucous that traps irritants, which in the case of the trachea keep these irritants from
getting into the lungs.
Figure 24.10 Pseudostratified columnar epithelia line the respiratory tract. They exist in one layer, but the arrangement
of nuclei at different levels makes it appear that there is more than one layer. Goblet cells interspersed between the
columnar epithelial cells secrete mucous into the respiratory tract.
