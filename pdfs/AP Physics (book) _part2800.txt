25–4 Telescopes
A telescope is used to magnify objects that are very far away. In most cases, the
object can be considered to be at infinity.
Galileo, although he did not invent it,† developed the telescope into a usable
and important instrument. He was the first to examine the heavens with the
telescope (Fig. 25–19), and he made world-shaking discoveries, including the
moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, sunspots, the structure of the Moon’s
surface, and that the Milky Way is made up of a huge number of individual stars.
