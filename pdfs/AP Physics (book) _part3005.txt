de an evacuated glass tube, called a photocell. The two electrodes are
connected to an ammeter and a source of emf, as shown. When the photocell is in
the dark, the ammeter reads zero. But when light of sufficiently high frequency
illuminates the plate, the ammeter indicates a current flowing in the circuit. We
explain completion of the circuit by imagining that electrons, ejected from the
plate by the impinging light, flow across the tube from the plate to the “collector” C
as indicated in Fig. 27–6.
That electrons should be emitted when light shines on a metal is consistent
with the electromagnetic (EM) wave theory of light: the electric field of an 
EM wave could exert a force on electrons in the metal and eject some of them.
Einstein pointed out, however, that the wave theory and the photon theory of
light give very different predictions on the details of the photoelectric effect. For
example, one thing that can be measured with the apparatus of Fig. 27–6 is the
maximum kinetic ene
