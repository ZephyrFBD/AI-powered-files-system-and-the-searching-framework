sis is an electrochemical process driven by an outside energy source.

2 Cl-1l2 ¡ Cl21g2 + 2 e- (d) When an aqueous solution of NaCl 
undergoes electrolysis, sodium metal is not formed because H2O is 
preferentially reduced to form H21g2 20.91 (a) 236 g Cr(s) (b) 2.51 A 
20.93 (a) 4.0 * 105 g Li (b) The minimum voltage required to drive 
the electrolysis is +4.41 V. 20.95 Gold is less active than copper and 
thus more difficult to oxidize. When a mixture of copper and gold is 
reﬁned by electrolysis, Cu is oxidized from the anode, but any metal-
lic gold present in the mixture is not oxidized, so it accumulates near 
the anode, available for collection.
