1. A group of researchers wished to gain information about a type of bacteria that was known to actively uptake
glucose across its cell membrane by use of a sodium-glucose cotransport mechanism whereby sodium and
glucose enter the cell together. The researchers conducted an experiment in which bacterial cells with a
relatively low intracellular sodium concentration were placed in glucose-rich media that had a relatively high
sodium ion concentration. At regular intervals, the medium was analyzed for glucose and sodium
concentrations.
Figure 1. Glucose and Na+ concentrations in medium (no
