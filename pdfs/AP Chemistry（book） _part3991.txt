of w is positive and the sign of q is negative, so we cannot 
absolutely determine the sign of ∆E. It is likely that the heat lost is much 
smaller than the work done on the system, so the sign of ∆E is prob-
ably positive. 5.10 (a) N21g2 + O21g2 ¡  2 NO1g2. Since ∆V = 0, 
w = 0. (b) ∆H = ∆Hf = 90.37 kJ. The deﬁnition of a formation reac-
tion is one where elements combine to form one mole of a single 
product. The enthalpy change for such a reaction is the enthalpy of 
formation. 5.13 (a) Eel = -4.3 * 10-18 J (b) ∆Eel = 4.1 * 10-18 J  
(c) The electrostatic potential energy of the system increases (becomes 
less negative) as the separation between the oppositely charged par-
ticles increases. 5.15 (a) Fel = -2.3 * 10-8 N (b) Fg = 1.0 * 10-47 
N  (c) The electrostatic force of attraction is 2.3 * 1039 times larger.  
5.17 w = 2.6 * 10-18 J. 5.19 (a) Gravity; work is done because the 
force of gravity is opposed and the pencil is lifted. (b) Spring force; 
work is done because the force
