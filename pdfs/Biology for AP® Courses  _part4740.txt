Figure 38.6 In 1980, Luis and Walter Alvarez, Frank Asaro, and Helen Michels discovered, across the world,
a spike in the concentration of iridium within the sedimentary layer at the K–Pg boundary. These researchers
hypothesized that this iridium spike was caused by an asteroid impact that resulted in the K–Pg mass extinction.
In the photo, the iridium layer is the light band. (credit: USGS)
Scientists measured the relative abundance of fern spores above and below the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary in a
rock sample. Which of the following statements most likely represents their findings?
a.
An abundance of fern spores from several species was found above the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, but
none were found below.
b.
Fern spores were found both above and below the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, but the spores were more
abundant below the boundary than above the boundar
