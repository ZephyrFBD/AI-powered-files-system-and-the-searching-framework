 The clarinet is a bit
complicated: it acts like a closed tube
at lower frequencies, having only odd
harmonics, but at higher frequencies
all harmonics occur as for an open tube.
The manner in which an instrument is played strongly influences the sound
quality. Plucking a violin string, for example, makes a very different sound than
pulling a bow across it. The sound spectrum at the very start (or end) of a note (as
when a hammer strikes a piano string) can be very different from the subsequent
sustained tone. This too affects the subjective tone quality of an instrument.
An ordinary sound, like that made by striking two stones together, is a noise
that has a certain quality, but a clear pitch is not discernible. Such a noise is a
mixture of many frequencies which bear little relation to one another. A sound
spectrum made of that noise would not show discrete lines like those of Fig.12â€“15.
Instead it would show a continuous, or nearly continuous, spectrum of frequencies.
Such a sound w
