ays a significant role in solution for-
mation, and ethanol is completely miscible with water.
Notice in Table 13.2 that the number of carbon atoms in an alcohol affects its solu-
bility in water. As this number increases, the polar OH group becomes an even smaller 
part of the molecule, and the molecule behaves more like a hydrocarbon. The solubility

of the alcohol in water decreases correspondingly. On the other hand, the solubility of 
alcohols in a nonpolar solvent like hexane 1C6H142 increases as the nonpolar hydrocar-
bon chain lengthens.
One way to enhance the solubility of a substance in water is to increase the num-
ber of polar groups the substance contains. For example, increasing the number of 
OH groups in a solute increases the extent of hydrogen bonding between that sol-
ute and wat
