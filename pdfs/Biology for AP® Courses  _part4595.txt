C. Apply Haldane’s approach to calculate the probability
p in the first generation after mating 150 female and 150
male flies that are heterozygous using wAA = wAa = 1.
Rendel (Evolution, 5, 1951) conducted an investigation of
the dependence of fecundity (fertility) on light in ebony-
eyed D. melanogaster. A summary of some of the data that
he reported is shown in the table below:

D. Pose two scientific questions concerning the
behavioral response indicated by the data that can be
tested experimentally.
E. Is there a question you can add here to wrap up this set
with this LO from the list? In this case “light” is the single
environmental factor, and th
