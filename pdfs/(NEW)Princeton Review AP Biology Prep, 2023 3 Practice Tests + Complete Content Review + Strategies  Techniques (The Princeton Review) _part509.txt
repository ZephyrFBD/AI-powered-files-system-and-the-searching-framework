e familiar with the effects of water gain in animal and plant cells. In animals, the direction of osmosis depends
on the concentration of solutes both inside and outside the cell. In plants, osmosis is also influenced by turgor
pressureâ€”the pressure that develops as water presses against a cell wall. If a plant cell loses water, the cell will
shrink away from the cell wall and plasmolyze.
Another important concept to understand is the importance of surface area and volume in cells. There are several
questions about each of these topics, but the necessary formulas are listed on the AP Biology Equations and
Formulas sheet. Cells maintain homeostasis by regulating the movement of solutes across the cell membrane. Small
cells have a large surface area-to-volume ratio; however, as cells become larger, this ratio becomes smaller, giving
the cell relatively less surface area to exchange solutes. A cell is limited in size by the surface area-to-volume ratio.
There are many organisms that have
