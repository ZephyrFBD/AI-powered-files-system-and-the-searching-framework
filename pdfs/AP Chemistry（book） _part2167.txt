 
the solution. (c) The Henry’s law constant for hydrogen 
in water at 25 °C is 7.8 * 10-4 mol>L@atm. Estimate the 
number of moles of hydrogen gas that remain dissolved 
in the solution. What fraction of the gas molecules in the 
system is dissolved in the solution? Was it reasonable to 
ignore any dissolved hydrogen in part (b)?

The following table presents the solubilities of several 
gases in water at 25 °C under a total pressure of gas and 
water vapor of 1 atm. (a) What volume of CH41g2 under 
standard conditions of temperature and pressure is con-
tained in 4.0 L of a saturated solution at 25 °C? (b) The 
solubilities (in water) of the hydrocarbons are as follows: 
methane 6 ethane 6 ethylene. Is this because ethylene 
is the most polar molecule? (c) What intermolecular 
interactions can these hydrocarbons ha
