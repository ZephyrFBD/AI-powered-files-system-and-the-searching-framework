The central Sn atom is bonded to the three Cl atoms and has one nonbonding 
pair; thus, we have four electron domains, meaning a tetrahedral electron- 
domain geometry (Table 9.1) with one vertex occupied by a nonbonding pair 
of electrons. A tetrahedral electron-domain geometry with three bonding and 
one nonbonding domains leads to a trigonal-pyramidal molecular geometry 
(Table 9.2).

Effect of Nonbonding Electrons and  
Multiple Bonds on Bond Angles
We can refine the VSEPR model to explain slight distortions from the ideal geometries 
summarized in Table 9.2. For example, consider methane 1CH42, ammonia 1NH32, and 
water 1H2O2. All three have a tetrahedral electron-domain geometry, but their bond 
 
angles differ slightly:

Notice that the bond angles decrease as the number of nonbonding electron pairs 
increases.
