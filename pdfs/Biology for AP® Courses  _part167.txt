s and products of this reaction are molecules (each atom remains bonded to at least one other
atom), in this reaction only hydrogen peroxide and water are representatives of compounds: they contain atoms of more
than one type of element. Molecular oxygen, on the other hand, as shown in Figure 2.10, consists of two doubly bonded
oxygen atoms and is not classified as a compound but as a homonuclear molecule.
Figure 2.10 The oxygen atoms in an O2 molecule are joined by a double bond.
Some chemical reactions, such as the one shown above, can proceed in one direction until the reactants are all used up.
The equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible. Reversible reactions are
those that can go in either direction. In reversible reactions, reactants are turned into products, but when the concentration of
product goes beyond a certain threshold (characteristic of the particular reaction), some of these products will be converted
back into reacta
