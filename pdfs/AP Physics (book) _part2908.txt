at the
same time, then the two events had to be simultaneous. This is because (i) the two
light pulses travel at the same speed (postulate 2), and (ii) the distance OA
equals OB, so the time for the light to travel from A to O and from B to O must
be the same. Observer O can then definitely state that the two events occurred
simultaneously. On the other hand, if O sees the light from one event before that
from the other, then the former event occurred first.
The question we really want to examine is this: if two events are simultaneous
to an observer in one reference frame, are they also simultaneous to another
observer moving with respect to the first? Let us call the observers 
and 
and assume they are fixed in reference frames 1 and 2 that move with speed v
relative to one another. These two reference frames can be thought of as two
rockets or two trains (Fig.26–4).
