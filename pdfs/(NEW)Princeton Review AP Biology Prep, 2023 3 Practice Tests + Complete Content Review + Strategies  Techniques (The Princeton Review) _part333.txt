e. When the genetic material is in a
loose form in the nucleus, it is called euchromatin, and its genes are active, or available for transcription. When the
genetic material is fully condensed into coils, it is called heterochromatin, and its genes are generally inactive.
Situated in the nucleus, chromosomes contain the recipe for all the processes necessary for life, including passing
themselves and their information on to future generations. In this chapter, we’ll look at precisely how they
accomplish this.
DNA REPLICATION
We said in the beginning of this chapter that DNA is the hereditary blueprint of the cell. By directing the
manufacture of proteins, DNA serves as the cell’s blueprint. But how is DNA inherited? For the information in
DNA to be passed on, it must first be copied. This copying of DNA is known as DNA replication.
Because the DNA molecule is twisted over on itself, the first step in replication is to unwind the double helix by
breaking the hydrogen bonds. This is acco
