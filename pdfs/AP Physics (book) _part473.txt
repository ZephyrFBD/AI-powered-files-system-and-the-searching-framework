From this equation we can see that the tension force 
at point 1 will get larger
if 
(ball’s speed at top of circle) is made larger, as expected. But we are asked
for the minimum speed to keep the ball moving in a circle. The cord will remain
taut as long as there is tension in it. But if the tension disappears (because 
is 
too small) the cord can go limp, and the ball will fall out of its circular path. Thus,
the minimum speed will occur if 
(the ball at the topmost point), for
which the equation above becomes
[minimum speed at top]
We solve for 
keeping an extra digit for use in (b):
This is the minimum speed at the top of the circle if the ball is to continue
moving in a circular path.
(b) When the ball is at the bottom of the circle (point 2 in Fig. 5–8), the cord
exerts its tension force 
upward, whereas the force of gravity,
still acts
downward. Choosing upward as positive, Newton’s second law gives:
[at bottom]
The speed 
is given as twice that in (a), namely 
We solve for
