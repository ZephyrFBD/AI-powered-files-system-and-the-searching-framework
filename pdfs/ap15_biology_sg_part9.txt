(c) A researcher estimates that, in a certain organism, the complete metabolism of glucose produces 30 
molecules of ATP for each molecule of glucose. The energy released from the total oxidation of glucose 
under standard conditions is 686 kcal/mol. The energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and 
inorganic phosphate under standard conditions is 7.3 kcal/mol. Calculate the amount of energy 
available from the hydrolysis of 30 moles of ATP. Calculate the efficiency of total ATP production from 
1 mole of glucose in the organism. Describe what happens to the excess energy that is released from 
the metabolism of glucose.
