acteria appeared within one
billion years of Earth’s formation. From these
evolved the phototrophic organisms which
produce oxygen as a by-product of
photosynthesis, leading to the oxygenation of the
atmosphere.

For the first two billion years of Earth’s
existence, the atmosphere had no molecular
oxygen. Thus, the first organisms were
anaerobic. Phototrophic organisms appeared
within one billion years of Earth’s formation.
From these organisms evolved the
cyanobacteria, which produce oxygen as a by-
product of photosynthesis, leading to the
oxygenation of the atmosphere.
