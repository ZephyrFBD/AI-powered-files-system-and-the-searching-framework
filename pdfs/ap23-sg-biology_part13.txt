major pathways of the light-dependent reactions of 
photosynthesis. In noncyclic electron flow, electrons pass through photosystem II, then components of a 
chloroplast electron transport chain, and then photosystem I before finally reducing NADP+ to NADPH. In 
cyclic electron flow, electrons cycle through photosystem I and some components of the electron transport 
chain (Figure 1).

component of the electron transport chain between the two photosystems. 
(a) 
Describe the role of chlorophyll in the photosystems of plant cells. 
Accept one of the following: 
• 
Chlorophyll captures/absorbs light (energy). 
• 
Chlorophyll receives electrons (from water)/receives electrons (from an electron 
transport chain)/transfers electrons (to an electron transport chain). 
1 point 
(b) 
 Based on Figure 1, explain why an increase in the ratio of NADPH to NADP+ will cause an 
increase in the
