strated process occurs thanks to a whole host of special enzymes and
pigments. But before we turn to the stages in photosynthesis, let’s talk about where photosynthesis occurs.
Chloroplast Structure
The leaves of plants contain lots of chloroplasts, which are the primary sites of photosynthesis.
Now let’s look at an individual chloroplast. If you split the membranes of a chloroplast, you’ll find a fluid-filled
region called the stroma. Inside the stroma are structures that look like stacks of coins. These structures are the
grana.
The many disk-like structures that make up grana are called thylakoids. They contain chlorophyll, a light-absorbing
pigment that drives photosynthesis, as well as enzymes involved in the process. The very inside of a thylakoid is
called the thylakoid lumen.
Many light-absorbing pigments participate in photosynthesis. Some of the more important ones are chlorophyll a,
chlorophyll b, and carotenoids. These pigments are clustered in the thylakoid membrane into u
