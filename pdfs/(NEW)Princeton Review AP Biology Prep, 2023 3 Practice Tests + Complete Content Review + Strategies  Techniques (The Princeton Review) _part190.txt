Mitochondria
Another important organelle is the mitochondrion. Mitochondria are often referred to as the “powerhouses” of the
cell. They’re power stations responsible for converting energy from organic molecules into useful energy for the
cell. The most common energy molecule in the cell is adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
More Mitochondria = More Energy
Since mitochondria are the cell’s powerhouses, you’re likely to find more of
them in cells that require a lot of energy. Muscle cells, for example, are rich in
mitochondria.
The mitochondrion is usually an easy organelle to recognize because it has a unique oblong shape and a
characteristic double membrane consisting of an inner portion and an outer portion. The inner mitochondrial
membrane forms folds known as cristae and separates the innermost area (the matrix) from the intermembrane
space. The outer membrane separates the intermembrane space from the cytoplasm. As we’ll see later, most of the
production of ATP
