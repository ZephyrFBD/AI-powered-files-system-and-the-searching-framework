ntaining two
chambers to determine how pillbugs react to their environment. Twenty
pillbugs were placed into the leȇmost chamber of the container. In the
first experiment, the right chamber was moistened with water absorbed
by paper towels. In the second, filter paper dampened with 1% acetic
acid was placed into the right chamber.
Table 1 shows the number of pillbugs per chamber over time.
