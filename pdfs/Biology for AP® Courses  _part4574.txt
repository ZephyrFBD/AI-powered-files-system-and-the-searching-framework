nesting materials and sites
for building nests.
A biologist observes that Species A and Species B
primarily inhabit different regions of a forest in western
Canada. During a forest fire that wiped out the region it
inhabited, Species B fled to the region inhabited by
Species A. Predict what is likely to happen to these two
species in the future. Explain your reasoning.
a.
Both the species will survive because of
difference in needs for food and nesting space.
b.
Species A will increase in population whereas
species B will remain same due to the
overlapping needs for food and nesting space.
c.
Only one of these species will survive in this
region due to the difference in needs for food
and nesting space. The species that loses will
either die off or migrate to another region.
d.
Only one of these species will survive in this
region due to the overlapping needs for food and
nesting space. The species that loses will either
die off or migrate to another region.
