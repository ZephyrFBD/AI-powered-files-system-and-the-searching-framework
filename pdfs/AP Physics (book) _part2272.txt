field at a point midway between them if the top one carries
a current of 20.0 A and
the bottom one carries
12.0 A?
32. (II) A horizontal compass is placed 18 cm due south from
a straight vertical wire carrying a 48-A current downward.
In what direction does the compass needle point at this
location? Assume the horizontal component of the Earth’s
field at this point is 
and the magnetic 
declination is 0°.
33. (II) A long horizontal wire carries 24.0 A of current due
north. What is the net magnetic field 20.0 cm due west of the
wire if the Earth’s field there points downward, 44° below
the horizontal, and has magnitude

space at a rate of 
What magnetic field
do they produce 1.5 m from the beam?
35. (II) Determine the magnetic field midway between two
long straight wires 2.0 cm apart in terms of the current I in
one when the other carries 25 A. Assume these currents
are (a) in the same direction, and (b) in opposite direc
