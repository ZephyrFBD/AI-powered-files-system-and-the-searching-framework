Transcription in prokaryotes (and in eukaryotes) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA
synthesis. The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble. Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA
strand for each gene, which is called the template strand. The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and
is almost identical to the other DNA strand, called the nontemplate strand. The only difference is that in mRNA, all of the
T nucleotides are replaced with U nucleotides. In an RNA double helix, A can bind U via two hydrogen bonds, just as in
A–T pairing in a DNA double helix.
The nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5' mRNA nucleotide is
transcribed is called the +1 site, or the initiation site. Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers
and are designated upstream. Conversely, nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with “+” numberi
