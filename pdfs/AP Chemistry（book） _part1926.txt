Here n represents the large number—ranging from hundreds to many thousands—of 
monomer molecules (ethylene in this case) that react to form one polymer molecule. 
Within the polymer, a repeat unit (the unit shown in brackets in the previous equation) 
appears over and over along the entire chain. The ends of the chain are capped by carbon–
hydrogen bonds or by some other bond, so that the end carbons have four bonds.
Polyethylene is an important material; its annual production exceeds 190 billion 
pounds each year. Although its composition is simple, the polymer is not easy to make. 
The right manufacturing conditions were identified only after many years of research. 
Today many forms of polyethylene, varying widely in physical properties
