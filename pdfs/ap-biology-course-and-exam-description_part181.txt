A polymerase 
and transcription factors bind to initiate 
transcription.
IST-2.C.2
Negative regulatory molecules inhibit gene 
expression by binding to DNA and blocking 
transcription.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
IST-2
Differences in the expression of genes account for some of the phenotypic 
differences between organisms.

IST-2.D
Explain the connection 
between the regulation 
of gene expression and 
phenotypic differences in 
cells and organisms.
IST-2.D.1
Gene regulation results in differential gene 
expression and influences cell products and 
function.
IST-2.D.2
Certain small RNA molecules have roles in 
regulating gene expression.
