mperature of the surface water begins to reach 4
°C, the water becomes heavier and sinks to the bottom. The water at the bottom of the lake is then displaced by the heavier
surface water and, thus, rises to the top. As that water rises to the top, the sediments and nutrients from the lake bottom are
brought along with it. During the summer months, the lake water stratifies, or forms layers, with the warmest water at the
lake surface.
As air temperatures drop in the fall, the temperature of the lake water cools to 4 °C; therefore, this causes fall turnover as the
heavy cold water sinks and displaces the water at the bottom. The oxygen-rich water at the surface of the lake then moves
to the bottom of the lake, while the nutrients at the bottom of the lake rise to the surface (Figure 35.10). During the winter,
the oxygen at the bottom of the lake is used by decomposers and other organisms requiring oxygen, such as fish.
