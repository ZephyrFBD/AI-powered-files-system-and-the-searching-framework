Nonmetals
Nonmetals can be solid, liquid, or gas. They are not lustrous and generally are poor 
conductors of heat and electricity. Their melting points are generally lower than those 
of metals (although diamond, a form of carbon, is an exception and melts at 3570 °C). 
Under ordinary conditions, seven nonmetals exist as diatomic molecules. Five of these 
are gases (H2, N2, O2, F2, and Cl2), one is a liquid 1Br22, and one is a volatile solid 1I22. 
Excluding the noble gases, the remaining nonmetals are solids that can be either hard, 
such as diamond, or soft, such as sulfur (Figure 7.17).

Do you think sulfur is malleable?

world as “brimstone,” is a nonmetal.
NiO
Nickel oxide (NiO), nitric acid (HNO3), and 
water
NiO is insoluble in water but reacts with 
HNO3 to give a green solution of the salt 
Ni(NO3)2.
