58  Both Jacques Charles and Joseph Louis Guy-Lussac were avid 
balloonists. In his original flight in 1783, Jacques Charles 
used a balloon that contained approximately 31,150 L of H2. 
He generated the H2 using the reaction between iron and hy-
drochloric acid:
 
 
Fe1s2 + 2 HCl1aq2 ¡  FeCl21aq2 + H21g2
 
 How many kilograms of iron were needed to produce this 
volume of H2 if the temperature was 22 °C?
 10.59 Hydrogen gas is produced when zinc reacts with sulfuric acid:
 
 
Zn1s2 + H2SO41aq2 ¡ ZnSO41aq2 + H21g2
 
 If 159 mL of wet H2 is collected over water at 24 °C and a 
barometric pressure of 738 torr, how many grams of Zn have 
been consumed? (The vapor pressure of water is tabulated in 
Appendix B.)
 10.60  Acetylene gas, C2H21g2, can be prepared by the reaction of 
calcium carbide with water:
 
 
CaC21s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡ Ca1OH221aq2 + C2H21g2

 Calculate the volume of C2H2 that is collected over water at 
23 °C by reaction of 1.524 g of CaC2 if the total pressure
