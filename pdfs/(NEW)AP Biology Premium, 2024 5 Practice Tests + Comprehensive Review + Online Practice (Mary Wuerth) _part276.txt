 are the same number of chromosomes at
the end of the anaphase I stage of meiosis as there are at the beginning of this stage.
During the telophase stage of mitosis, two new nuclei are formed. This is followed by cytokinesis and results in
two diploid cells. In the telophase I stage of meiosis, two new nuclei are formed. When followed by
cytokinesis, this results in two haploid cells, as shown in Figure 12.1.

Meiosis II
The second round of cell division in meiosis is called meiosis II, and it is very similar to mitosis. Meiosis II consists
of four stages: prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II. However, unlike in mitosis, the events of
meiosis II are not preceded by the replication of DNA.
DNA is replicated prior to the start of mitosis and is followed by one cell division, resulting in two diploid cells at the end of mitosis. However, while
DNA is also replicated before the start of meiosis I, it is then followed by two cell divisions (meiosis I
