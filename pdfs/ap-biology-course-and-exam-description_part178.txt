y more than one codon.
d. Nearly all living organisms use the same 
genetic code, which is evidence for the 
common ancestry of all living organisms.
e. tRNA brings the correct amino acid to the 
correct place specified by the codon on the 
mRNA.
f. The amino acid is transferred to the growing 
polypeptide chain.
g. The process continues along the mRNA until 
a stop codon is reached.
h. The process terminates by release of the 
newly synthesized polypeptide/protein.

Genetic information in retroviruses is a special 
case and has an alternate flow of information: 
from RNA to DNA, made possible by reverse 
transcriptase, an enzyme that copies the 
viral RNA genome into DNA. This DNA 
integrates into the host genome and becomes 
transcribed and translated for the assembly of 
new viral progeny.
