 Morgan began using 
it for genetic studies in 1907. The common fruit fly lives throughout the world and 
feeds on fruit and the fungi growing on rotting fruit. It is a small fly, and one could 
question why scientists have spent so much time and effort on this tiny insect. It is 
about the size of President Roosevelt’s nose on a dime, but despite its small size, the fly 
is packed with many interesting physical and behavioral characteristics. Its genome has 
been sequenced, its physical characteristics have been charted and mutated, its meiotic 
processes and development have been investigated, and its behavior has been the source 
of many experiments. Because of its scientific usefulness, Drosophila is a model research 
organism. Its name is based on observations about the fly; the fly follows circadian 
rhythms that include sleeping during the dark and emerging as an adult from a pupa in 
the early morning. This latter behavior gave rise to the name Drosophila, which means 
“lover o
