 products collectively comprises the 
normal function of organisms.
ii. Disruptions in genes and gene products 
cause new phenotypes. 
IST-2.E.2
Alterations in a DNA sequence can lead to 
changes in the type or amount of the protein 
produced and the consequent phenotype. DNA 
mutations can be positive, negative, or neutral 
based on the effect or the lack of effect they 
have on the resulting nucleic acid or protein and 
the phenotypes that are conferred by the protein.
