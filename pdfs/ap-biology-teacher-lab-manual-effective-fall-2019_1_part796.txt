alinity. Numerous colleges and universities have 
available soil science sites on the Internet. Students can explore these websites to gather 
information to begin their investigative research. 
Topic C: Ask students to consider evolutionary questions such as Have plants evolved 
 
different characteristics to cope with specific abiotic conditions, such as salt marsh (salinity 
issues), high mountain pastures, deserts, acidified environments (acid rain), and estuaries? 
Are there different optimums for the same abiotic factors within different plants? Have 
plants evolved over time because of the influence or selectivity due to the abiotic factors 
associated with their environments? Students can develop presentations for the class that 
help address their conclusions. 
Considering Topic C: The key to understanding evolution and natural selection 
is grasping that variations in a population of a species aid in the selective forces of 
the environment. To investigate this concept, some
