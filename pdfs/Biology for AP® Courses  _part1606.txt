ial cells become competent (able to
transport DNA through the cytoplasmic membrane) in
response to stress such as UV radiation, high population
density, or heat shock. Such conditions are often difficult
to model in the laboratory, where competence can be
induced by high concentrations of divalent cations, Ca+2 or
Mg+2, or electrical shock. In either setting, extracellular
DNA can be transported into the cell, and (to a good
approximation) uptake is proportional to the concentration
of extracellular DNA.
D. Identify a factor that might affect transformation or
HGT. Then, design a plan to evaluate the dependence of
transformational efficiency (defined as the number of
transformations per gram of extracellular DNA) of
plasmids that transfer antibiotic resistance to a particular
strain of Escherichia coli that is not resistant on that factor.
71. Prior to the work of Hershey and Chase, scientists
thought that inheritance involved “nucleoproteins.” The
amount of information to be transmitt
