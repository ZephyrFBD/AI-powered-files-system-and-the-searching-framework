ropped from rest at
the same time the other ball was
projected horizontally outward.
The vertical position of each ball is
seen to be the same at each instant.
EXERCISE C Two balls having different speeds roll off the edge of a horizontal table at
the same time. Which hits the floor sooner, the faster ball or the slower one?

If an object is projected at an upward angle, as in Fig. 3–20, the analysis is
similar, except that now there is an initial vertical component of velocity,
Because of the downward acceleration of gravity, the upward component of
velocity 
gradually decreases with time until the object reaches the highest
point on its path, at which point
Subsequently the object moves down-
ward (Fig. 3–20) and 
increases in the downward direction, as shown (that is,
becoming more negative). As before,
remains constant.
