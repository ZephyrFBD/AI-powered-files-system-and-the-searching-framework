in using the thick-walled seeds as food. More 
food led to greater reproductive success for the large-beaked finches. Thus, 
allele frequencies within the finch population changed, with an increase in 
alleles conferring the more advantageous phenotype â€” larger beaks. Changes 
in allele frequencies in a population provide evidence for evolution.
(C)
This option is incorrect. The data provide no evidence to support the conclusion 
that new alleles appeared in the finch population through mutation. Within the 
population, there was variation in beak size, and changes in the environment 
(drought) provided a selective pressure favoring finches with larger beaks to crack 
thick-walled seeds.
(D)
This option is incorrect. The population is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
because of changes in allele frequencies attributed to natural selection. The 
population is not in equilibrium because beak size is changing.
