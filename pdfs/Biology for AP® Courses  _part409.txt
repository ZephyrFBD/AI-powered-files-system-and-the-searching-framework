There are three basic types of cells: archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. Both archaea and bacteria are classified as

prokaryotes, whereas cells of animals, plants, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes. Archaea are a unique group of organisms
and likely evolved in the harsh conditions of early Earth and are still prevalent today in extreme environments, such as hot
springs and polar regions. All cells share features that reflect their evolution from a common ancestor; these features are 1)
a plasma membrane that separates the cell from its environment; 2) cytoplasm comprising the jelly-like cytosol inside the
cell; 3) ribosomes that are important for the synthesis of proteins, and 4) DNA to store and transmit hereditary information.
Prokaryotes may also have a cell wall that acts as an extra layer of protection against the external environment. The term
