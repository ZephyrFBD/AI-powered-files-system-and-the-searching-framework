ing Ras), but that exchange occurs on a cytoplasmic protein, not a membrane-bound protein.
9. A. When a ligand binds to a protein kinase receptor (such as receptor tyrosine kinase, RTK), it causes it to form a
dimer with a second protein kinase receptor. Once the dimer forms, it attaches phosphate groups to itself
(autophosphorylates).
10. B. An activated GPCR exchanges a GTP for a GDP on the G protein. The G protein is a nearby membrane-
bound protein.
 
11. D. A ligand-gated ion receptor opens a gate, providing a passageway for ions to enter or exit the cell.
 
12. B. Second messengers are activated by the protein that is activated by the G protein of a GPCR.

Questions
1. Each of the receptor proteins requires activation by the binding of a ligand. Also, the binding of the ligand to the
receptor protein causes a conformational change in its three-dimensional structure.
2. Once activated, a protein kinase receptor, like RTK, direct
