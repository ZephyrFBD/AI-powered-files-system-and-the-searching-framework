Figure 24.17 Blood is a connective tissue that has a fluid matrix, called plasma, and no fibers. Erythrocytes (red blood
cells), the predominant cell type, are involved in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Also present are various
leukocytes (white blood cells) involved in immune response.
The cell found in greatest abundance in blood is the erythrocyte. Erythrocytes are counted in millions in a blood sample:
the average number of red blood cells in primates is 4.7 to 5.5 million cells per microliter. Erythrocytes are consistently the
same size in a species, but vary in size between species. For example, the average diameter of a primate red blood cell is 7.5
um, a dog is close at 7.0 um, but a catâ€™s RBC diameter is 5.9 um. Sheep erythrocytes are even smaller at 4.6 um. Mammalian
erythrocytes lose their nuclei and mitochondria when they are released from the bone marrow where they are made. Fish,
amphibian, and avian red blood cells maintain their nuclei and mitochondri
