 10.12). Increases in the concentration of cyclin proteins are triggered by both external and internal signals.
After the cell moves to the next stage of the cell cycle, the cyclins that were active in the previous stage are degraded.

Figure 10.12 The concentrations of cyclin proteins change throughout the cell cycle. There is a direct correlation
between cyclin accumulation and the three major cell cycle checkpoints. Also note the sharp decline of cyclin levels
following each checkpoint (the transition between phases of the cell cycle), as cyclin is degraded by cytoplasmic
enzymes. (credit: modification of work by "WikiMiMa"/Wikimedia Commons)
Cyclins regulate the cell cycle only when they are tightly bound to Cdks. To be fully active, the Cdk/cyclin complex must
also be phosphorylated in specific locations. Like all kinases, Cdks are enzymes (kinases) that phosphorylate
