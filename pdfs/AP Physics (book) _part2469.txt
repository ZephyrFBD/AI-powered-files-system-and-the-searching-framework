arth distance. This result would apply if the spacecraft was far
from the Earth so the Earth’s gravitational force is small compared to 10 N.
NOTE A large sail providing a small force over a long time could result in a lot
of motion. [Gravity due to the Sun and planets has been ignored, but in reality
would have to be considered.]

ESTIMATE
Although you cannot directly feel the effects of radiation pressure, the
phenomenon is quite dramatic when applied to atoms irradiated by a finely
focused laser beam. An atom has a mass on the order of 
and a laser
beam can deliver energy at a rate of 
This is the same intensity used in
Example 22–5, but here
