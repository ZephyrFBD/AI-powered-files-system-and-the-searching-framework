 as shown in Fig. 19–21b. This
“exponential decay” curve is given by
where 
is the initial voltage across the capacitor. The voltage falls 63% of the
way to zero (to 
) in a time
Because the charge Q on the capacitor
is
we can write
for a discharging capacitor, where 
is the initial charge.
The voltage across the resistor will have the same magnitude as that across
the capacitor at any instant, but the opposite sign, because there is zero applied 
emf:
so
A graph of 
vs. time would just
be Fig.19–21b upside down. The current
The current has its greatest magnitude at
and decreases exponentially 
in time. (The current has a minus sign because in Fig. 19–21a it flows in the oppo-
site direction as compared to the current in Fig. 19–20a.)
