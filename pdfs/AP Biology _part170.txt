omething is, the
more potential energy it possesses. The more stable something is, the less
potential energy it possesses. Chemical energy, a form of potential
energy, is energy that is stored in chemical bonds. In general, the more
bonds there are in a molecule, the greater its potential energy is. (Fat, a
complex molecule, contains more potential and chemical energy than a
simple sugar, like glucose.) Kinetic energy is related to anything that
moves. Thermal energy is kinetic energy that is associated with random
movement of particles. The higher the temperature of an object, the faster
its particles move and the greater its kinetic energy is. When thermal
energy is transferred from one object to another, it is called heat. Light is
another form of energy. Light consists of the electromagnetic spectrum
from gamma radiation (shortest) to radio waves (longest).
Living organisms require a constant input of energy. Biological
systems constantly transform this energy from one form to anot
