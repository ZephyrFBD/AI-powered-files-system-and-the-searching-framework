20. Skeletons have been found that indicate that mice with jaw angles less than 30 degrees were once found on
Island B. Which explanation best accounts for this?
(A) A small jaw angle hinders the survival of mice on Island B.
(B) A large jaw angle hinders the survival of mice on Island A.
(C) A small jaw angle encourages the survival of mice on Island C.
(D) A large jaw angle encourages the survival of mice on Island A.
21. Which of the following statements best supports that the jaw angle on Island B changed via punctuated
equilibrium?
(A) Fossil evidence has shown that over time the jaw angle on Island B slowly increased.
(B) Fossil evidence has shown that the jaw angle of the mice on Island B increased very quickly.
(C) Fossil evidence has shown that over time the jaw angle on Island B slowly decreased.
(D) Fossil evidence has shown that the jaw angle o
