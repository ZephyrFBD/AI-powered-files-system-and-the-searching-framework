s conversions of forms of energy when trinitroglycerin is used as an explosive to break rockfaces in highway 
construction.
SOLUTION
The enthalpy change for this decomposition is 41-1541.4 kJ2 =
-6165.6 kJ. [We need to multiply by 4 because there are 4 mol of 
C3H5N3O91l2 in the balanced equation.]
This enthalpy change equals the sum of the heats of forma-
tion of the products minus the heats of formation of the reac-
tants, each multiplied by its coefficient in the balanced equation:
-6165.6 kJ = 6∆Hf°3N21g24 + 12∆Hf°3CO21g24 + 10∆Hf°3H2O1l24
+ ∆Hf°3O21g24-4∆Hf°3C3H5N3O91l24
The ∆Hf° values for N21g2 and O21g2 are zero, by definition. Using the 
values for H2O1l2 and CO21g2 from Table 5.3 or Appendix C, we have
(a) The general form of the equation we must balance is
C3H5N3O91l2 ¡  N21g2 + CO21g2 + H2O1l2 + O21g2
We go about balancing in the usual way. To obtain an even num-
ber of nitrogen atoms on the left, we multiply the formula for 
C3H5N3O9 by 2, which gives us 3 mol of N2, 6 mol
