ll movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called the neural tube, as
illustrated in Figure 34.25. In further development, the neural tube will give rise to the brain and the spinal cord.
Figure 34.25 The central region of the ectoderm forms the neural tube, which gives rise to the brain and the spinal
cord.
The mesoderm that lies on either side of the vertebrate neural tube will develop into the various connective tissues of the
animal body. A spatial pattern of gene expression reorganizes the mesoderm into groups of cells called somites with spaces

between them. The somites, illustrated in Figure 34.26 will further develop into the ribs, lungs, and segmental (spine)
muscle. The mesoderm also forms a structure called the notochord, which is rod-shaped and forms the central axis of the
animal body.
