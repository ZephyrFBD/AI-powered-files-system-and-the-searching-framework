 The result is NADH, a molecule to be used in oxidative
phosphorylation (where the reverse of this reaction occurs), if oxygen is present, to generate 3 ATPs. The reverse of
this reaction also occurs during anaerobic reactions. In the absence of oxygen, the Krebs cycle
and oxidative phosphorylation cannot occur, and no NAD+ is released
 
from NADH. In order to at least continue with glycolysis, where a net of
 
2 ATPs is generated, the NADH is converted back to NAD+ during
 
alcohol or lactic acid fermentation, allowing glycolysis to continue.
50. D. This polypeptide is drawn to show only its primary structure, that is, a linear display of its amino acids. The
secondary, tertiary, and is, a linear display of its amino acids. The secondary, tertiary, and dimensional shapes that
are essential for their proper functioning.
