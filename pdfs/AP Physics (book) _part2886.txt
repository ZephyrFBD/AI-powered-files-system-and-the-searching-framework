 Explain the different results and their impact
on finished photographs.
4. Describe at least four advantages of using mirrors rather
than lenses for an astronomical telescope.
5. An astronomical telescope, Fig. 25–20, produces an inverted
image. One way to make a telescope that produces an upright
image is to insert a third lens between the objective and
the eyepiece, Fig. 25–23b. To have the same magnification,
the non-inverting telescope will be longer. Suppose lenses
of focal length 150 cm, 1.5 cm, and 10 cm are available.
Where should these three lenses be placed to make a
non-inverting telescope with magnification 
6. Mizar, the second star from the end of the Big Dipper’s
handle, appears to have a companion star,Alcor. From Earth,
Mizar and Alcor have an angular separation of 12 arc 
minutes (1 arc 
). Using Examples 25–10 and
25–11, estimate the angular resolution of the human eye
(in arc min). From your estimate, explain if these two stars
can be resolved by the naked eye.
