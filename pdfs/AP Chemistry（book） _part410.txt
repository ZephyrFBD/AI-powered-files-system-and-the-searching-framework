Combination and decomposition Reactions
In combination reactions, two or more substances react to form one product (Table 3.1). For 
 
example, magnesium metal burns brilliantly in air to produce magnesium oxide (Figure 3.6):
 
2 Mg1s2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 MgO1s2  
[3.6] 
TABLE 3.1 Combination and Decomposition Reactions
Combination Reactions
A + B ¡ C
Two or more reactants combine to form a single 
product. Many elements react with one another 
in this fashion to form compounds.
C1s2 + O21g2 ¡ CO21g2
N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ¡ 2 NH31g2
CaO1s2 + H2O1l2 ¡ Ca1OH221aq2
Decomposition Reactions
C ¡ A + B
A single reactant breaks apart to form two or 
more substances. Many compounds react this 
way when heated.
2 KClO31s2 ¡ 2 KCl1s2 + 3 O21g2
PbCO31s2 ¡ PbO1s2 + CO21g2
Cu1OH221s2 ¡ CuO1s2 + H2O1g2

Products
Reactants
The ribbon of magnesium metal is 
surrounded by oxygen gas in the air.
The reaction forms MgO, a 
white, ionic solid.
