 air, is -196 °C. Thus, 
when air is liquefied and then allowed to warm, the N2 boils off, leaving liquid O2 con-
taminated mainly by small amounts of N2 and Ar.
Much of the O2 in the atmosphere is replenished through photosynthesis, in which 
green plants use the energy of sunlight to generate O2 (along with glucose, C6H12O6) 
from atmospheric CO2:
 
6 CO21g2 + 6 H2O1l2 ¡ C6H12O61aq2 + 6 O21g2

Uses of Oxygen
In industrial use, oxygen ranks behind only sulfuric acid 1H2SO42 and nitrogen 1N22. 
Oxygen is by far the most widely used oxidizing agent in industry. Over half of the O2 
produced is used in the steel industry, mainly to remove impurities from steel. It is also 
used to bleach pulp and paper. (Oxidation of colored compounds often gives colorless 
products.) Oxygen is used together with acetylene 1C2H22 in oxyacetylene welding (Fig-
ure 22.11). The reaction between C2H2 and O2 is highly exothermic, producing tempera-
tures in excess of 3000 °C.
