ge number of  
finches was measured every year  
from 1981 to 1987. 
(D) Finches were captured and bred in 1981, and 
the beak size of the offspring was measured. 
 
 8. Which of the following statements might best 
explain the increase in average beak size in the 
finch population during the drought? 
(A) Finches with bigger beaks are better able to 
crack thick-walled seeds and produce more 
surviving offspring. 
(B) Finches with bigger beaks can attack and kill 
finches with smaller beaks. 
(C) Finches with bigger beaks possess more-
powerful flight muscles and are able to find 
more food. 
(D) Finches that crack large seeds develop larger 
beaks over time. 
 
 9. Which of the following best describes the 
mechanism behind the change in beak size in  
the finch population? 
(A) The formation of two new finch species from 
a single parent species 
(B) A change in gene frequencies in the finch 
population due to selective pressure from  
the environmental change 
(C) A new allele appe
