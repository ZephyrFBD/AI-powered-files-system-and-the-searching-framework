SECTION 22.3  Group 8A: The Noble Gases 
951
Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are used in lighting, display, and laser applica-
tions in which the atoms are excited electrically and electrons that are in a higher energy 
state emit light as they return to the ground state. 
 (Section 6.2) Argon is also used as 
a protective atmosphere to prevent oxidation in welding and certain high-temperature 
metallurgical processes.
Helium is in many ways the most important noble gas. Liquid helium is used as 
a coolant to conduct experiments at very low temperatures.
