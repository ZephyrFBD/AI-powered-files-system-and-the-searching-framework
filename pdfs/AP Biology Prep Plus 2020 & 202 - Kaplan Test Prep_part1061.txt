nithine. This suggests that ornithine is the first intermediate,
and the mutation impacts the function of enzyme 2, which catalyzes ornithine. Mutant 1 can
grow in arginine and argininosuccinate but not ornithine and citrulline. This suggests that
Ornithine is the first intermediate 
Citrulline is the second intermediate 
Argininosuccinate is the third intermediate 
Ornithine is the first intermediate because Mutant 4 grows if given arginine, citrulline, and argininosuccinate,
but not ornithine.
Citrulline is the second intermediate because Mutant 1 can grow in arginine and argininosuccinate, but not
ornithine and citrulline (and ornithine is the first intermediate).
Argininosuccinate is the third intermediate because Mutant 3 only grows in minimal medium with arginine (and
ornithine and citrulline are the first two intermediates).
citrulline is the second intermediate, and the mutation impacts the function of enzyme 3,
which catalyzes citrulline. Mutant 3 only grows in minimal medium
