servation suggests that the peaks are characteristic of
the target material used. Indeed, we can explain the peaks by imagining that the
electrons accelerated by the high voltage of the tube can reach sufficient energies
that, when they collide with the atoms of the target, they can knock out one of 
the very tightly held inner electrons. Then we explain these characteristic X-rays
(the peaks in Fig. 28â€“11) as photons emitted when an electron in an upper state
drops down to fill the vacated lower state. The K lines result from transitions into
the K shell 
The 
line consists of photons emitted in a transition that
originates from the 
(L) shell and drops to the
(K) shell. On the other
hand, the 
line reflects a transition from the 
(M) shell down to the K shell.
An L line is due to a transition into the L shell, and so on.
Measurement of the characteristic X-ray spectra has allowed a determina-
tion of the inner energy levels of atoms. It has also allowed the determination of
Z values
