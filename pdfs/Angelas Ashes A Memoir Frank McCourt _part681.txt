 I could understand my father sucking the bad stuff out of Michael’s 
 
 head when he was a baby and desperate but I don’t understand why 
 
 God wanted St. Moling to go around sucking the snot out of lepers’ 
 
 heads. I don’t understand God at all and even if I’d like to be a saint and 
 
 have everyone adore me I’d never suck the snot of a leper. I’d like to be 
 
 a saint but if that’s what you have to do I think I’ll stay the way I am. 
 
 Still, I’m ready to spend my life in this library reading about virgins 
 
 and virgin martyrs till I get into trouble with Miss O’Riordan over

 tell this is a Chinese name and I’m curious to know what the Chinese 
 
 talk about. It’s a book of essays
