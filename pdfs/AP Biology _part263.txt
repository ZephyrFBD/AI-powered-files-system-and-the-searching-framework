it. If the individual being tested is hybrid (Bb), one-half of the
offspring can be expected to show the recessive trait. Therefore, if any
offspring show the recessive trait, the parent of unknown genotype must be
hybrid.
If the parent of unknown genotype is BB, there can be no white offspring.
If the parent of unknown genotype is hybrid, there is a 50% chance that
any offspring will be white.
LAW OF INDEPENDENT ASSORTMENT
The law of independent assortment applies when a cross is carried out
between two individuals hybrid for two or more traits that are not on the
same chromosome. This type of cross is called a dihybrid cross. This law
states that during gamete formation, the alleles of a gene for one trait, such
as height (Tt), segregate independently from the alleles of a gene for
another trait, such as seed color (Yy). Figure 8.2 represents a dihybrid
individual (TtYy) where the traits will assort independently. In it, T = tall, t
= short, Y = yellow seed, and y = green seed.
