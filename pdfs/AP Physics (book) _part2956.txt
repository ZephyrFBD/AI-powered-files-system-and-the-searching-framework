1 The Impact of Special Relativity
A great many experiments have been performed to test the predictions of the special
theory of relativity. Within experimental error, no contradictions have been found.
Scientists have therefore accepted relativity as an accurate description of nature.
At speeds much less than the speed of light, the relativistic formulas reduce to
the old classical ones, as we have discussed. We would, of course, hope—or rather,
insist—that this be true since Newtonian mechanics works so well for objects
moving with speeds
This insistence that a more general theory (such as
relativity) give the same results as a more restricted theory (such as classical
mechanics which works for
) is called the correspondence principle. The 
two theories must correspond where their realms of validity overlap. Relativity
thus does not contradict classical mechanics. Rather, it is a more general theory,
of which classical mechanics is now considered to be a limiting c
