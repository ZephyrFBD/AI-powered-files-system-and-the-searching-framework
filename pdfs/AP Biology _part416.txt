Earth’s history.
HISTORY OF EARTH
Events in Earth’s history can be dated by several methods. Studying
undisturbed sedimentary rock layers and the fossils within them reveals
the relative age of rocks and fossils. The absolute age of rocks can be
accurately measured by radiometric dating, which is based on the decay of
radioactive isotopes and half-life. Although radiometric dating is a
powerful tool, sometimes there is inadequate rock or fossils available to
measure, so scientists must use other techniques. Paleomagnetic dating
uses the fact that Earth’s magnetic poles shift and sometimes even reverse.
These changes are recorded in rock layers. Other scientific methods of
dating Earth use changes in sea levels, molecular clocks, and
measurements of continental drift.
By employing all these methods, scientists have learned that Earth has
radically changed since it formed 4.5 billion years ago. Continents have
shifted. The climate has gone through periods of extreme cooling and
warming.
