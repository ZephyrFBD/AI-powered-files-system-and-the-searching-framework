hat all your 
units are comparable: per time, mass, and energy.
Step 1 For Fast Plants, assume that one gram of dried biomass contains 4.35 kilocalories 
of energy. This estimate was determined by burning similar plant material in a bomb 
calorimeter.
Step 2 You were investigating living butterfly larvae, so you could not dry them or their 
food supply. Assume that the biomass of 4th instar larvae is 40% of the wet mass. (This 
estimate may be inaccurate, so you should actually measure this quantity using extra 
butterfly larvae, if possible.) Calculate the biomass of the larvae. For butterfly larvae, use 
an average value of 5.5 kcal/g of biomass to calculate energy of each larva.

Step 3 To determine the energy content in the larval frass, use 4.76 kcal of energy/g of 
frass. Calculate the frass lost per individual larva. 
Step 4 To determine the energy content of the brussels sprouts eaten by each larva, 
convert the wet mass of
