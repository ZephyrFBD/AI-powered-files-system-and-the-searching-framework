11 nm = 1 * 10-9 m2.
Inspection of Equation 5.2 shows that electrostatic potential energy goes to zero as 
d becomes infinite. Thus, zero electrostatic potential energy is defined as infinite sep-
aration of the charged particles. Figure 5.2 illustrates how Eel behaves as the distance 
between two charges is varied. When Q1 and Q2 have the same sign (for example, both 
are positive), the two charged particles repel each other, and a repulsive force pushes 
them apart. In order to bring two positively charged objects close together, one would 
have to do work to overcome the repulsive force that exists between the two. Upon 
releasing them, they would move away from each other as potential energy is con-
verted to kinetic energy. In this case, Eel is positive, and the potential energy decreases 
as the distance between particles increases. When Q1 and Q2 have opposite signs, the 
particles attract each other, and an attractive force pulls
