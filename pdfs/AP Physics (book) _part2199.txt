Magnetic force on a proton. A magnetic field exerts a
force of 
toward the west on a proton moving vertically upward at a
speed of 
(Fig. 20–16a). When moving horizontally in a northerly
direction, the force on the proton is zero (Fig. 20–16b). Determine the magnitude
and direction of the magnetic field in this region. (The charge on a proton is
)
APPROACH Since the force on the proton is zero when moving north, the field
must be in a north–south direction (
in Eq. 20–3). To produce a force to
the west when the proton moves upward, right-hand-rule-3 tells us that 
must
point toward the north. (Your thumb points west and the outstretched fingers
of your right hand point upward only when your bent fingers point north.)
The magnitude of 
is found using Eq. 20–3.
