o late in the morning they’re liable to be cranky after seeing hundreds 
 
 of men women and children sick and asking for help. She will take 
 
 us with her to prove she has four children to feed. She gets us up early 
 
 231 
 
 and tells us for once in our lives don’t wash our faces, don’t comb our 
 
 hair, dress in any old rag. She tells me give my sore eyes a good rub and 
 
 make them as red as I can for the worse you look at the Dispensary the 
 
 more pity you get and the better your chances of getting the public 
 
 assistance. She complains that Malachy Michael and Alphie look too 
 
 healthy and you’d wonder why on this day of days they couldn’t have 
 
  
  
 their usual scabby knees or the odd cut bruise or black eye. If we meet 
 
 anyone in the lane or the streets of Limerick we are not to tell them 
 
 where we’re going. She feels ashamed enough without telling the 
 
 whole world and wait till her own mother hears. 
 
 There is a queue already outside the Dispensary.T
