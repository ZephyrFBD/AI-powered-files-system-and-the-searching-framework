rmation of the Ag1NH322
+ complex drastically reduces the con-
centration of free Ag+ ion in solution.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
You have an aqueous solution of chromium(III) nitrate that 
you titrate with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. 
After a certain amount of titrant has been added, you observe a 
precipitate forming. You add more sodium hydroxide solution 
and the precipitate dissolves, leaving a solution again. What 
has happened? (a) The precipitate was sodium hydroxide, 
which redissolved in the larger volume. (b) The precipitate was 
chromium hydroxide, which dissolved once more solution was 
added, forming Cr3 +1aq2. (c) The precipitate was chromium 
hydroxide, which then reacted with more hydroxide to pro-
duce a soluble complex ion, Cr1OH24
-1aq2. (d) The precipitate 
was sodium nitrate, which reacted with more nitrate to pro-
duce the soluble complex ion Na1NO323
 2 -1aq2.
