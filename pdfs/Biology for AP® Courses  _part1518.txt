The elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA divides and makes copies of itself. This
model suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template
from which the new complementary strand is copied. What was not clear was how the replication took place. There were
three models suggested (Figure 14.12): conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive.
Figure 14.12 The three suggested models of DNA replication. Grey indicates the original DNA strands, and blue
indicates newly synthesized DNA.
In conservative replication, the parental DNA remains together, and the newly formed daughter strands are together. The
semi-conservative method suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands act as a template for new DNA to be
synthesized; after replication, each double-stranded DNA include
