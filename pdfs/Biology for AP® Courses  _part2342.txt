Baltimore Classification
The most commonly used system of virus classification was developed by Nobel Prize-winning biologist David Baltimore
in the early 1970s. In addition to the differences in morphology and genetics mentioned above, the Baltimore classification
scheme groups viruses according to how the mRNA is produced during the replicative cycle of the virus.
Group I viruses contain double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as their genome. Their mRNA is produced by transcri
