Anabaena is a simple multicellular photosynthetic
cyanobacterium. In the absence of fixed nitrogen, certain
newly developing cells along a filament express genes that
code for nitrogen-fixing enzymes and become non-
photosynthetic heterocysts. The specialization is
advantageous because some nitrogen-fixing enzymes
function best in the absence of oxygen. Heterocysts do not
carry out photosynthesis but instead provides adjacent
cells with fixed nitrogen and receives fixed carbon and
reduced energy carriers in return. As shown in the diagram
above, when there is low fixed nitrogen in the
environment, an increase in the concentration of free
calcium ions and 2-oxyglutarate stimulates the expr
