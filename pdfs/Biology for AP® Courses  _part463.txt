Many diseases arise from genetic mutations that prevent the synthesis of critical proteins. One such disease
is Lowe disease (also called oculocerebrorenal syndrome, because it affects the eyes, brain, and kidneys).
In Lowe disease, there is a deficiency in an enzyme localized to the Golgi apparatus. Children with Lowe
disease are born with cataracts, typically develop kidney disease after the first year of life, and may have
impaired mental abilities.
Lowe disease is a genetic disease caused by a mutation on the X chromosome. The X chromosome is one
of the two human sex chromosomes, as these chromosomes determine a person's sex. Females possess
two X chromosomes while males possess one X and one Y chromosome. In females, the genes on only
one of the two X chromosomes are expressed. Females who carry the Lowe disease gene on one of their
X chromosomes are carriers and do not show symptoms of the disease. However, males only have one X
