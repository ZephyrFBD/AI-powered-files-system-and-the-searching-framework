tion of insects, body color is being studied: 36% of the insects
represent the orange color, which is recessive, and 64% represent the black dominant phenotype.
If each successive generation maintains
the allele frequency, the population is said
to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
1) Determine the allelic frequencies.
2) Determine the genotypic frequencies.
i.
The recessive phenotype is key to this problem because the dominant represents both AA and
Aa. However, recessive is only represented by aa. Use logic that q2 = aa; therefore, the square
root of .36 or q = 0.6. Since p + q = 1, p + 0.6 = 1, then p = 0.4.
ii. Allelic frequencies are A = 0.4, a = 0.6
iii. Genotypic frequencies follow the equation p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1
iv. p2 = (0.4)2 = 0.16 = 16%
(AA or homozygous dominant) → Black phenotype
2pq = 2 x 0.6 x 0.4 = 0.48 = 48%
(Aa, heterozygous dominant) → Black phenotype
q2 = (0.6)2 = 0.36 = 36%
(aa, homozygous recessive) → Orange phenotype
16 + 48 + 36 = 100 (Always double-check your n
