omozygous recessive). To look at the
types of offspring that these parents could produce, we have to figure out the gametes that each parent can possibly
make (and thus contribute to the offspring).
Each parent has two copies of the height gene and each gamete gets one copy. This means each parent can make two
types of gametes. For the homozygous dominant parent, the two copies are T and T. In other words, all gametes
from this parent will contain the tall, or T, allele. The homozygous recessive plant can make gametes with t and with
t. Notice again that because the parent plant was homozygous, only one type of allele (t, or short) will be passed on
to the next generation. We will put the possible gametes for each parent on the top and left side of the square as
shown below.
Keep This In Mind
When a parent is homoâ€‹zygous, both of their gametes will be identical, but it is
still helpful to list each gamete individually on the square.
Now we can fill in the four boxes by matching the let
