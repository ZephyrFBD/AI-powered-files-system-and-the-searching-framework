am to locate (approximately) the position of
the image. (b) Determine the position of the image and the magnification analytically.
APPROACH We draw the ray diagram using the rays as in Fig. 23–15, page 651.
An analytic solution uses Eqs. 23–1, 23–2, and 23–3.
SOLUTION (a) Since
the object is between the mirror and
the focal point. We draw the three rays as described earlier (Fig. 23–15); they are
shown leaving the tip of the object in Fig.23–17. Ray 1 leaves the tip of our object
heading toward the mirror parallel to the axis, and reflects through F. Ray 2
cannot head toward F because it would not strike the mirror; so ray 2 must
point as if it started at F (dashed line in Fig. 23–17) and heads to the mirror, and
then is reflected parallel to the principal axis. Ray 3 is perpendicular to the
mirror and reflects back on itself. The rays reflected from the mirror diverge and
so never meet at a point. They appear to be coming from a point behind the
mirror (dashed lines). This point loca
