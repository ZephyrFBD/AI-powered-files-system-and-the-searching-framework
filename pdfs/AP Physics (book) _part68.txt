he sciences is itself only a few
centuries old. It is no wonder then that the development of physics has both
influenced and been influenced by other fields. For example, the notebooks
(Fig. 1–3) of Leonardo da Vinci, the great Renaissance artist, researcher, and
engineer, contain the first references to the forces acting within a structure, a
subject we consider as physics today; but then, as now, it has great relevance to
architecture and building.
Early work in electricity that led to the discovery of the electric battery and
electric current was done by an eighteenth-century physiologist, Luigi Galvani
(1737–1798). He noticed the twitching of frogs’ legs in response to an electric spark
and later that the muscles twitched when in contact with two dissimilar metals
(Chapter 18). At first this phenomenon was known as “animal electricity,” but it
shortly became clear that electric current itself could exist in the absence of an animal.
Physics is used in many fields. A zoologist, for
