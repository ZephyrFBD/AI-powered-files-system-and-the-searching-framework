 collapsed. Every night they leave the teeth in the kitchen in jam jars 
 
 filled with water. Malachy wants to know why and Dad tells him it 
 
 cleans them. Mam says, No, you can’t have teeth in your head while 
 
 you’re sleeping for they’ll slip and choke you to death entirely. 
 
 The teeth are the cause of Malachy going to Barrington’s Hospital 
 
 and me having an operation. Malachy whispers to me in the middle of 
 
 the night, Do you want to go downstairs and see if we can wear the 
 
 teeth? 
 
 The teeth are so big we have trouble getting them into our mouths 
 
 but Malachy won’t give up. He forces Dad’s upper teeth into his mouth 
 
 and can’t get them out again. His lips are drawn back and the teeth make 
 
 a big grin. He looks like a monster in a film and it makes me laugh but
