Range of a cannon ball. Suppose one of Napoleon’s cannons
had a muzzle speed,
of 
At what angle should it have been aimed
(ignore air resistance) to strike a target 320 m away?
APPROACH We use the equation just derived for the range,
with
SOLUTION We solve for 
in the range formula:
We want to solve for an angle 
that is between 0° and 90°, which means 
in
this equation can be as large as 180°. Thus,
is a solution, so
.
But
is also a solution (see Appendix A–7), so
can also be 
. In general we have two solutions (see Fig. 3–25b),
which in the present case are given by
Either angle gives the same range. Only when
(so
)  is there
a single solution (that is, both solutions are the same).
u0 = 45°
sin 2u0 = 1
u0 = 30.3° or 59.7°.
u0 = 59.7°

2u0 = 180° - 60.6° = 119.4°
u0 = 30.3°
