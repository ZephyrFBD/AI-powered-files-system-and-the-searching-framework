NA. The viral DNA is later transcribed into mRNA and translated into proteins.
Some RNA viruses such as the influenza virus never go through a DNA step. The RNA genome is replicated by an RNA
dependent RNA polymerase which is virally encoded.
The content presented in this section supports the Learning Objectives outlined in Big Idea 1 and Big Idea 3 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives merge Essential Knowledge content with one or more of the
seven Science Practices. These Learning Objectives provide a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, along
with inquiry-based laboratory experiences, instructional activities, and AP® Exam questions.

Enduring
Understanding
1.B
Organisms are linked by lines of descent from common ancestry.
Essential
Knowledge
