ferring recessive diseases onto offspring.
Heritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that can be attributed to genetic differences, or genetic variance, among
individuals in a population. The greater the hereditability of a population’s phenotypic variation, the more susceptible it is
to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation.
The diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is called genetic variance. When scientists are involved in
the breeding of a species, such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves, they try to increase a population’s genetic
variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can. This also helps reduce the risks associated with
inbreeding, the mating of closely related individuals, which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious
recessive mutations that can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease. For example, a disease that is caused by a
rare, recessive allele might exist
