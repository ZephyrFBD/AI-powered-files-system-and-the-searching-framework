ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-3.A.1
Organisms use feedback mechanisms to 
maintain their internal environments and respond 
to internal and external environmental changes.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
ENE-3
Timing and coordination of biological mechanisms involved in growth, reproduction, 
and homeostasis depend on organisms responding to environmental cues.
SUGGESTED SKILL
Argumentation
6.E.b
Predict the causes or effects 
of a change in, or disruption 
to, one or more components 
in a biological system based 
on a visual representation 
of a biological concept, 
process, or model.
TOPIC 4.5
Feedback
ENE-3.B
Explain how negative 
feedback helps to maintain 
homeostasis.
ENE-3.C
Explain how positive 
feedback affects 
homeostasis.
ENE-3.B.1
Negative feedback mechanisms maintain 
homeostasis for a particular condition by 
regulating physiological processes. If a system 
is perturbed, negative feedback mechanisms 
return the system back to its target set point. 
These processes operate at the
