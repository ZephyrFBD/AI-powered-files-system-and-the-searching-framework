Figure 16–32a shows the electric field lines due to two equal charges of
opposite sign, a combination known as an electric dipole. The electric field lines
are curved in this case and are directed from the positive charge to the negative
charge. The direction of the electric field at any point is tangent to the field line at
that point as shown by the vector arrow 
at point P. To satisfy yourself that this
is the correct pattern for the electric field lines, you can make a few calculati
