83. The current through the 
resistor in Fig. 19–81 does
not change whether the two switches 
and 
are both
open or both closed.

84. (a) What is the equivalent resistance of the circuit shown in
Fig. 19–82? [Hint: Redraw the circuit to see series and
parallel better.] (b) What is the current in the

79. A power supply has a fixed output voltage of 12.0 V, but you
need 
output for an experiment. (a) Using the
