a + charge;
In step 2, the image to be copied is projected onto the drum. For simplicity, let us
assume the image is a dark letter A on a white background (as on the page of a
book) as shown in Fig. 16–41. The letter A on the drum is dark, but all around it
is light. At all these light places, the selenium becomes conducting and electrons
flow in from the aluminum beneath, neutralizing those positive areas. In the dark
areas of the letter A, the selenium is nonconducting and so retains the positive
charge already p
