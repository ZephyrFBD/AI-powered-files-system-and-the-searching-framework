thin cells causing a
condition called NPC Disease.
Scientists from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and the Whitehead Institute for
Biomedical Research discovered that the Ebola virus also uses NPC1 to hitch a ride into cells and replicate. The scientists
used mice that lacked the NPC1 protein to test this hypothesis. When the scientists tried to infect these mice with Ebola,
none of the mice got sick. Then they tried to infect mice with partially functioning NPC1 and found that they got sick, but
did not die. In other words, without properly functioning NPC1, the Ebola virus cannot infect a mouse. If this pattern also

exists in humans, it means that anyone with NPC Disease and its subsequent problem with high cholesterol may also be
protected from Ebola.
