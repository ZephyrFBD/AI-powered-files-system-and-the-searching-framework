it is not likely that the freshwater fish would have a lower water
potential than its new saltwater environment.
8. (D) Potato slices that are stiff and hard gained water, and potato slices that are limp and soft lost water. Since
potato slices became stiff and hard in distilled water, distilled water has a higher water potential than the potato,
and the potato is hypertonic to distilled water. Since the potato slices became limp and soft in 0.5 molar sucrose
solution, the potatoes have a higher water potential than the 0.5 molar sucrose solution and are hypotonic to the
sucrose solution. Choice (A) is incorrect because the potato slices are hypertonic to distilled water. The potato
slices are hypotonic to the 0.5 molar sucrose solution, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (C) is incorrect because
the potato slices are hypertonic to distilled water and hypotonic to the 0.5 molar sucrose solution.
9. (C) Human cells with an NaCl concentration of 0.15 moles per liter would have a higher w
