to that of a tennis court. Recent measurements, however,
show that the surface area of the gut is closer to that of a
studio apartment (Helander and Fandriks, Jour. Gastro,
2014) and is roughly 50 square meters.
A. Calculate the cellular surface area of the 100 trillion
(1014) microbes in the typical human gut, assuming that
the cells are spherical with an average radius of 0.001 mm.
Use this calculated surface area to predict the relative
rates of procurement of nutrients by both microbes and the
host cells lining the large and small intestines.
Humans compete with microbes for nutrients, but the
relationship is mutually beneficial. Between 10 and 30%
of ingested food remains undigested before reaching the
large intestine. Some microbial waste products,
particularly H2 and CH4, are not resources for the host.
But short-chain fatty acids like acetic, propionic, and
butyric acids are resources that microbes extract from the
undigested fraction. The large intestine of the adult human
