d the plasma membrane, passes through the channel.
Note that plant cells can generally be distinguished from animal cells by the following:
 
1. the presence of cell walls, chloroplasts, and central vacuoles in plant cells and their absence in animal cells
 
2. the presence of centrioles and cholesterol in animal cells and their absence in plant cells
Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes
The cells described so far are those of eukaryotic organisms. Eukaryotes include all organisms except for bacteria
and archaea. Bacteria and archaea are prokaryotes and lack most of the structures described above. They generally
consist of only a plasma membrane, a DNA molecule, ribosomes, cytoplasm, and often a cell wall. In addition, they
differ from eukaryotes in the following respects:
1. Prokaryotes do not have a nucleus.
2. The hereditary material in prokaryotes exists as a single “naked” DNA molecule without the proteins that are
associated with the DNA in eukaryotic chromosomes.
3. Prokaryotic ribosomes
