1.1.5 Four Ways to Represent a Function 
To help us understand what a function is, we have used machine and arrow diagrams. We 
can describe a specific function in the following four ways: 
 
verbally (by a description in words) 
 
algebraically (by an explicit formula) 
 
visually (by a graph) 
 
numerically (by a table of values) 
 
 
Example 4 
Let F (C) be the Fahrenheit temperature corresponding to the Celsius temperature C. (F is 
the function that converts Celsius inputs to Fahrenheit outputs.) The previous box of “Four 
ways to represent a function”, gives a verbal description of
