ht. In any case, use two weights that are easily
detectable as different.
Record the observations: Record the data in a table similar to the table below. For the one-pound and
20-pound groups (base weights) record a plus sign (+) for each participant that detects a difference between
the base weight and the step weight. Record a minus sign (-) for each participant that finds no difference. If
one-tenth steps were not used, then replace the steps in the “Step Weight” columns with the step you are
using.

Analyze the data/report the results: What step weight did all participants find to be equal with one-pound
base weight? What about the 20-pound group?
