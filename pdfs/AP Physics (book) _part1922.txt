rom rest acquires 4.8 keV of KE
in moving from point A to point B. (a) How much KE would
a proton acquire, starting from rest at B and moving to
point A? (b) Determine the ratio of their speeds at the end
of their respective trajectories.

18. (I) What is the electric potential 15.0 cm from a 
point charge?
19. (I) A point charge Q creates an electric potential of 
at a distance of 15 cm. What is Q?
20. (II) A 
point charge is placed 46 cm from an identi-
cal 
charge. How much work would be required to
move a 
test charge from a point midway between
them to a point 12 cm closer to either of the charges?
21. (II) (a) What is the electric potential

apart—as might
