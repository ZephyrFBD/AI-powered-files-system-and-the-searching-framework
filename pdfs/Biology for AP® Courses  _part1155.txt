other proteins.
Phosphorylation activates the protein by changing its shape. The proteins phosphorylated by Cdks are involved in advancing
the cell to the next phase. (Figure 10.13). The levels of Cdk proteins are relatively stable throughout the cell cycle; however,
the concentrations of cyclin fluctuate and determine when Cdk/cyclin complexes form. The different cyclins and Cdks bind
at specific points in the cell cycle and thus regulate different checkpoints.

Figure 10.13 Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are protein kinases that, when fully activated, can phosphorylate and
thus activate other proteins that advance the cell cycle past a checkpoint. To become fully activated, a Cdk must bind
to a cyclin protein and then be phosphorylated by another kinase.
Since the cyclic fluctuations of cyclin levels are based on the timing of the cell cycle and not on specific events, regulation
of the cell cycle usually occurs by either the Cdk molecules alone or
