of the water balances the osmotic pressure. Osmosis proceeds constantly in living systems.
The beaker example here occurs in an open system where the volume of fluid can increase and decrease freely. Cells, on
the other hand, are composed of proteins and other substances embedded in the aqueous cytoplasm. These substances could
be considered solutes for the purposes of predicting osmosis. The cell membrane keeps most of the proteins and other
substances within the cell, causing the cell to have a higher osmolarity than pure water.
Suppose you perform an experiment where you placed red blood cells in an environment of pure water. What do you
suppose would happen to the cells? Because the concentration of solute is higher in the red blood cell than it is in the beaker,
water would rush into the red blood cell. What do you think would happen to the red blood cell, given that its cell membrane
is made up of a fixed surface area? It is likely that the red blood cell will undergo hemolys
