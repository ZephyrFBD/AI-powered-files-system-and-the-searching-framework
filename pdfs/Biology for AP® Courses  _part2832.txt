Loose/Areolar Connective Tissue
Loose connective tissue, also called areolar connective tissue, has a sampling of all of the components of a connective
tissue. As illustrated in Figure 24.12, loose connective tissue has some fibroblasts; macrophages are present as well.
Collagen fibers are relatively wide and stain a light pink, while elastic fibers are thin and stain dark blue to black. The space
