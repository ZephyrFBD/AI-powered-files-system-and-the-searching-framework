regulation), RNAi after transcription (post-transcriptional regulation), and by various reactions and regulators
after translation (post-translational regulation). This regulation is dynamic and can either increase or decrease
gene expression, RNA levels, and protein levels according to the needs of the cell.
Mutations can result from changes in the DNA message or the mRNA message.
Mutations can be small (single nucleotide swaps, additions, or deletions) or large (big chunks or entire
chromosomes are swapped, duplicated, or deleted).
Some examples of biotechnology are:
recombinant DNA
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
transformation of bacteria
gel electrophoresis
Bacteria and viruses are common pathogens. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. Viruses require a
host to replicate and sometimes lyse the host cell during infection.
