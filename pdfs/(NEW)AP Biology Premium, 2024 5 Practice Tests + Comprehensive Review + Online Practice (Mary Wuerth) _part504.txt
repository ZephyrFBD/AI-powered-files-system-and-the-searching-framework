which they live change. Some examples of continuing evolution include:
Antibiotic resistance in bacteria
Tumor cells developing resistance to chemotherapy drugs
Pesticide resistance in insects
Evolution of previously unseen viruses and other pathogens
Genomic changes in organisms over time

1. In the 1950s, Stanley Miller performed an experiment to investigate the possible origin of the molecules
required for life on Earth. Water vapor, methane, hydrogen gas, and ammonia were placed in a flask, and
electric charges were applied to the system to simulate atmospheric conditions that were thought to be prevalent
at the time. After many weeks, amino acids were produced in the system. Which of the following hypotheses is
best supported by the results of this experiment?
(A) The molecules needed for life on Earth were brought to Earth by a meteorite.
(B) The molecules needed for life coul
