Problem 39.
26. (II) What is the electric field strength at a point in space
where a proton experiences an acceleration of 2.4 million
“g’s”?
27. (II) An electron is released from rest in a uniform electric
field and accelerates to the north at a rate of 
Find the magnitude and direction of the electric field.
28. (II) The electric field midway between two equal but oppo-
site point charges is 
and the distance between
the charges is 16.0 cm. What is the magnitude of the charge
on each?
29. (II) Calculate the electric field at one corner of a square
1.22 m on a side if the other three corners are occupied by
charges.
30. (II) Calculate the electric field at the center of a square
42.5 cm on a side if one corner is occupied by a 
charge and the other three are occupied by 
charges.
31. (II) Determine the direction and magnitude of the electric
field at the point P in Fig. 16–56. The charges are separated
by a distance 2a, and point
