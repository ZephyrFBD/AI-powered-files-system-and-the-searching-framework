Applying this rule to our present example, we see that when we multiply Ka and Kb, 
we obtain
 Ka * Kb = a

b-
 = 3H+43OH-4 = Kw
Thus, the product of Ka and Kb is the ion-product constant for water, Kw (Equation 16.16). 
We expect this result because adding Equations 16.38 and 16.39 gave us the autoioniza-
tion equilibrium for water, for which the equilibrium constant is Kw.
The above result holds for any conjugate acid–base pair. In general, the product of the 
acid-dissociation constant for an acid and the base-dissociation constant for its conjugate base 
equals the ion-product constant for water:
 
Ka * Kb = Kw 1for a conjugate acid9base pair2 
[16.40]
Note that this relationship only holds true for conjugate acid–base pairs. You should not 
use Equation 16.40 for any random pair of acids and bases! As the strength of an acid in-
creases (Ka gets larger), the strength of its conjugate base must decrease (Kb
