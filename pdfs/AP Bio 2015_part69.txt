31. Which of the following is the most likely effect of
the mutation at nucleotide position 7 in the GULO 
gene of humans?
(A) The mutation results in the deletion of the
GULO gene, so no polypeptide can be 
translated. 
(B) The deletion of the single nucleotide causes a 
frame shift, changing the primary structure 
downstream of the mutation and resulting in 
a nonfunctional protein. 
(C) The point mutation causes a substitution of 
the amino acid isoleucine (Ile) for histidine 
(His) at position 7, resulting in a protein 
with higher than normal activity. 
(D) The substitution of a single nucleotide in the 
GULO coding region results in a stop 
codon. This results in a smaller 
nonfunctional protein. 
32. Lemurs are primates that live on the island of
Madagascar off the coast of Africa. Lemurs have
a functional GULO gene and are able to produce
ascorbic acid. However, primates
