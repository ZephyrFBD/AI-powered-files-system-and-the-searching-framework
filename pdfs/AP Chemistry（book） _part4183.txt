page 605 True. Enzymes act as catalysts and there-
fore increase the rate of the reaction.

True page 630 It does not depend on starting concentrations.  
page 631 Yes, Kc = Kp when the number of moles of gaseous  
products and the number of moles of gaseous reactants are equal.  
page 632 0.00140 page 634 Kc = 91 page 634 It is cubed.  
page 636 Kp = P

page 647 (a) to the right, (b) to the left page 648 (bottom) It  
will shift to the left, the side with a larger number of moles of gas.  
page 650 Endothermic. Raising the temperature of an endothermic 
reaction shifts the equilibrium to the right, increasing the vapor 
pressure of the gaseous product. page 652 It will stay the same. 
The presence of a catalyst can accelerate the reaction but does not 
alter the value of K, which is what limits the amount of product  
produced.
