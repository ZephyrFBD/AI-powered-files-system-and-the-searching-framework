mplementary DNA twist to form a helix often described as a spiral ladder with
each base pair representing a single step.
ii. Each turn of the double helix contains 10 base pairs and is 34 angstroms long.
iii. The width of the helix is uniform and is 10 angstroms across.
4. Base pairing rules of purines and pyrimidines were established (also known as Chargaff’s rule).

1. Experiment indicated that replication of DNA is semi-conservative, or one old strand is used for the
synthesis (template) of a new strand.
2. Experiment showed that both heavy and light nitrogen would be incorporated into the daughter DNA
during the first round of DNA replication. In the second round of replication, daughter strands would
have only light nitrogen since the heavy nitrogen was removed. Banding patterns indicated a semi-
conservative model is favored over conservative or dispersive.
