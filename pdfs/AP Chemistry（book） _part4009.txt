e (Z) increases, effective nuclear charge (Zeff) increases 
and ionic radius decreases. 7.33 (a) Cl 6 S 6 K (b) K+ 6 Cl- 6 S2 -   
(c) The neutral K atom has the largest radius because the n-value of its 
outer electron is larger than the n-value of valence electrons in S and 
Cl. The K+ ion is smallest because, in an isoelectronic series, the ion 
with the largest Z has the smallest ionic radius. 7.35 (a) O2 -  is larger 
than O because the increase in electron repulsions that accompanies 
∼1 * 10 - 6 m radiation is in the infrared portion of the spectrum. 
(b) 8.1 * 1016 photons  >  s 6.33 (a) Emin = 7.22 * 10-19 J 
(b) l = 275 nm (c) E120 = 1.66 * 10-18 J. The excess energy of the 
120-nm photon is converted into the kinetic energy of the emitted 
electron. Ek = 9.3 * 10-19  J  >  electron. 6.35 When an electron in a 
hydrogen atom transitions from n = 1 to n = 3, the atom “expands”.
