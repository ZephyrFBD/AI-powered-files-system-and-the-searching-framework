rgy and cool from liquid to solid, the molecules get more dense,
moving closer together. However, in liquid water, the molecules are slightly more dense than in solid water. Because
water expands on freezing, becoming slightly less dense than liquid water, ice can crack lead pipes in the winter, or
a soda can will pop if it is left in your cold car. The important consequence of this property of water is that ice floats
on the top of lakes or streams, allowing animal life to live underneath the ice. If ice was denser than water, it would
sink to the bottom, freezing the body of water solid. All aquatic life would be unable to survive.
So let’s review the unique properties of water:
Water is polar and can dissolve other polar substances.
Water has cohesive and adhesive properties.
Water has a high heat capacity.
Water expands when it freezes (or, ice floats).
ACIDS AND BASES
We just said that water is important because most reactions occur in watery solutions. Well, there’s one more thin
