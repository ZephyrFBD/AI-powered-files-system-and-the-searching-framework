and when light nuclei fuse (fusion).
NUCLEAR FISSION AND FUSION (SECTIONS 21.7 AND 21.8)  
Uranium-235, uranium-233, and plutonium-239 undergo fission 
when they capture a neutron, splitting into lighter nuclei and re-
leasing more neutrons. The neutrons produced in one fission can 
cause further fission reactions, which can lead to a nuclear chain 
reaction. A reaction that maintains a constant rate is said to be crit-
ical, and the mass necessary to maintain this constant rate is called 
a critical mass. A mass in excess of the critical mass is termed a super-
critical mass.
In nuclear reactors, the fission rate is controlled to generate a 
constant power. The reactor core consists of fuel elements containing 
fissionable nuclei, control rods, a moderator, and a primary coolant. 
A nuclear power plant resembles a conventional power plant except 
that the reactor core replaces the fuel burner. There is concern about 
the disposal of highly radioactive nuclear wastes that are generated
