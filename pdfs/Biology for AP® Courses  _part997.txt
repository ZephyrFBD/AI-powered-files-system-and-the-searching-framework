s focused on the
way carbon from a solution containing bicarbonate ions is
absorbed by algae. In aqueous solution, the bicarbonate
anion (HCO3-) is in equilibrium with dissolved CO2 as
shown in the equation below:
H+ + HCO3
−←⎯⎯
→
⎯⎯
H2 O + CO2
In a later experiment, Larsson and Axelsson (1999) used
acetazolamide (AZ), a carbonate anhydrase inhibitor, to
inhibit enzymes that convert bicarbonate into carbon
dioxide. They also used disulfonate (DIDS), an inhibitor of
the transport of anions, such as the bicarbonate ion,
through the plasma membrane.
A. Pose a scientific question that can be pursued with AZ
and DIDS in terms of the path of carbon in photosynthesis.
B. The plasma membrane is permeable to the nonpolar,
uncharged carbon dioxide molecule. However, the
concentration of carbon dioxide in solution can be very
small. Explain how the enzyme carbonate anhydrase can
increase the availability of carbon dioxide to the cell.
C. Larsson and Axelsson conducted experiments in which
