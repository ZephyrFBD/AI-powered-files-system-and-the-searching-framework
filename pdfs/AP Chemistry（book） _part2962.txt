CFBr3 to accelerate depletion of the ozone layer?
 18.29  Nitrogen oxides like NO2 and NO are a significant source 
of acid rain. For each of these molecules write an equation 
that shows how an acid is formed from the reaction with 
water.
 18.30  Why is rainwater naturally acidic, even in the absence of 
polluting gases such as SO2?
 18.31  (a) Write a chemical equation that describes the attack of 
acid rain on limestone, CaCO3. (b) If a limestone sculp-
ture were treated to form a surface layer of calcium sul-
fate, would this help to slow down the effects of acid rain? 
Explain.
 18.32  The first stage in corrosion of iron upon exposure to air is 
oxidation to Fe2+. (a) Write a balanced chemical equation 
to show the reaction of iron with oxygen and protons from 
acid rain. (b) Would you expect the same sort of reaction to 
occur with a silver surface? Explain.
