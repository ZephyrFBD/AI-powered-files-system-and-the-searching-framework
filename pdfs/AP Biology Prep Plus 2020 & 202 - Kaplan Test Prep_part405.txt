d glycolysis can continue.
Lactic acid fermentation occurs in certain fungi and bacteria and in
animal muscle cells during strenuous activity. When the oxygen supply to
muscle cells lags behind the rate of glucose catabolism, the pyruvate
generated is reduced to lactic acid. As in alcohol fermentation, the NAD+
used in step 5 of glycolysis is regenerated when pyruvate is reduced. In
humans, lactic acid may accumulate in the muscles during exercise,
causing a decrease in blood pH that leads to muscle fatigue. Once the
oxygen supply has been replenished, the lactic acid is oxidized back to
pyruvate and enters cellular respiration. The amount of oxygen needed
for this conversion is known as the oxygen debt.
Aerobic Respiration
PYRUVATE DECARBOXYLATION
The pyruvate formed during glycolysis is transported from the cytoplasm
into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is decarboxylated; that is, it loses
a CO2, and the acetyl group that remains is transferred to coenzyme A to
form acetyl-CoA. In
