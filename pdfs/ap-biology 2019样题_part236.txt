time and is supported by multiple lines of evidence.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
SYI-2
Competition and cooperation are important aspects of biological systems. 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
EVO-1.O
Explain the interaction 
between the environment 
and random or preexisting 
variations in populations. 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
SYI-2.A
Explain how invasive species 
affect ecosystem dynamics.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
EVO-1.O.1
An adaptation is a genetic variation that is 
favored by selection and is manifested as a trait 
that provides an advantage to an organism in a 
particular environment.
EVO-1.O.2
Mutations are random and are not directed by
