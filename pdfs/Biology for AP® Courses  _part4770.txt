Figure 38.10 Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels fluctuate in a cyclical manner. However, the burning of fossil fuels in
recent history has caused a dramatic increase in the levels of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere, which have
now reached levels never before seen in human history. Scientists predict that the addition of this “greenhouse gas” to
the atmosphere is resulting in climate change that will significantly impact biodiversity in the coming century.
Habitat Loss
Humans rely on technology to modify their environment and replace certain functions that were once performed by the
natural ecosystem. Other species cannot do this. Elimination of their ecosystem—whether it is a forest, a desert, a grassland,
a freshwater estuarine, or a marine environment—will kill the individuals in the species. Remove the entire habitat within
the range of a species and, unless they are one of the few species that do well in human-built environments, the speci
