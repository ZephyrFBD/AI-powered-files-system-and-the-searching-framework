imate the total mass
of our Galaxy using the orbital data above for the Sun about the center of the
Galaxy. Assume the mass of the Galaxy is concentrated in the central bulge.
APPROACH We assume that the Sun (including our solar system) has total mass m
and moves in a circular orbit about the center of the Galaxy (total mass M), and that
the mass M can be considered as being located at the center of the Galaxy. We
then apply Newton’s second law,
with a being the centripetal accelera-
tion,
and for F we use the universal law of gravitation (Chapter 5).
SOLUTION Our Sun and solar system orbit the center of the Galaxy, according to
the best measurements as mentioned above, with a speed of about 
at a distance from the Galaxy center of about
We use Newton’s
second law:
where M is the mass of the Galaxy and m is the mass of our Sun and solar
system. Solving this, we find
NOTE In terms of numbers of stars, if they are like our Sun 
there would be about 
or very roughly on
the order of 100 bi
