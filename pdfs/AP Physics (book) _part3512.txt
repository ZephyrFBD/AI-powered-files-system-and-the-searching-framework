e. If the
frequency, f, of this pulse corresponds precisely to the energy difference between
the two energy levels (Fig. 31–24), so that
(31;11)
then the photons of the RF beam will be absorbed, exciting many of the nuclei
from the lower state to the upper state. This is a resonance phenomenon because
there is significant absorption only if f is very near
Hence the name
“nuclear magnetic resonance.” For free 
nuclei, the frequency is 42.58 MHz for
a magnetic field
If the H atoms are bound in a molecule the total
magnetic field 
at the H nuclei will be the sum of the external applied field
plus the local magnetic field 
due to electrons and nuclei of neigh-
boring atoms. Since f is proportional to 
the value of f for a given external
field will be slightly different for bound H atoms than for free atoms:
This small change in frequency can be measured, and is called the “chemical
shift.”A great deal has been learned about the structure of molecules and bonds
using this NMR technique.
