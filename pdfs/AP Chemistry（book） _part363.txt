 2.16  An unknown particle is caused to move between two electri-
cally charged plates, as illustrated in Figure 2.7. You hypoth-
esize that the particle is a proton. (a) If your hypothesis is 
correct, would the particle be deflected in the same or op-
posite direction as the b rays? (b) Would it be deflected by a 
smaller or larger amount than the b rays?
 2.17  What fraction of the a particles in Rutherford’s gold foil ex-
periment are scattered at large angles? Assume the gold foil 
is two layers thick, as shown in Figure 2.9, and that the ap-
proximate diameters of a gold atom and its nucleus are 2.7 
 
Å and 1.0 * 10–4 Å, respectively. Hint: Calculate the cross 
sectional area occupied by the nucleus as a fraction of that 
occupied by the atom.  Assume that the gold nuclei in each 
layer are offset from each other.
 2.18  Millikan determined the charge on the electron by study-
ing the static charges on oil drops falling in an electric 
field (Figure 2.5). A
