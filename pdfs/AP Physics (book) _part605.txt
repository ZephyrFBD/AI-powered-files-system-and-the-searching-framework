6–5 Conservative and
Nonconservative Forces
The work done against gravity in moving an object from one point to another
does not depend on the path taken. For example, it takes the same work
to lift an object of mass m vertically a height h as to carry it up an 
incline of the same vertical height, as in Fig. 6–4 (see Example 6–2). Forces 
such as gravity, for which the work done does not depend on the path taken but
only on the initial and final positions, are called conservative forces. The elastic
force of a spring (or other elastic material), in which
