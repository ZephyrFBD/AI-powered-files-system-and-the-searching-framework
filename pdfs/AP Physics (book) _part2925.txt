 was pointed out. According to this twin paradox, suppose one of a pair
of 20-year-old twins takes off in a spaceship traveling at very high speed to a
distant star and back again, while the other twin remains on Earth. According to
the Earth twin, the astronaut twin will age less. Whereas 20 years might pass for
the Earth twin, perhaps only 1 year (depending on the spacecraft’s speed) would
pass for the traveler. Thus, when the traveler returns, the earthbound twin could
expect to be 40 years old whereas the traveling twin would be only 21.
