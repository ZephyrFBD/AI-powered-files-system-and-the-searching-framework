first spaceship is already moving, (b) directly backward
toward Earth.
50. (II) An observer on Earth sees an alien vessel approach 
at a speed of 0.60c. The fictional starship Enterprise comes
to the rescue (Fig. 26â€“13), overtaking the aliens while
moving directly toward Earth at a speed of 0.90c relative
to Earth. What is the relative speed of one vessel as seen
by the other?
51. (II) A spaceship in distress sends out two escape pods in
opposite directions. One travels at a speed
in one direction, and the other travels at a speed
in the other direction, as observed from the
spaceship. What speed does the first escape pod measure
for the second escape pod?
52. (II) Rocket A passes Earth at a speed of 0.65c. At the
same time, rocket B passes Earth moving 0.95c relative to
Earth in the same direction as A. How fast is B moving
relative to A when it passes A?
53. (II) Your spaceship, traveling at 0.90c, needs to launch a
