 a nucleotide sequence,
making the protein dysfunctional. The break in the strand
is then recognized and replaced with the code for the
functional protein. If the editing is done with zygote-
forming cells, the change is inherited. Not only the patient,
but all progeny of the patient, are cured. This technology is
the first to easily make genomic modifications of a germ
line. In the words of a prominent molecular biologist, this
technology, which was recognized as the Breakthrough of
2015 in the journal Science, “democratizes genetic
engineering.” Just as PCR became a standard, widely used
tool, any molecular biology lab is now able to apply this
technology.
B. Pose three questions—whose pursuit would require an
understanding of genetics—regarding the ethical and
social issues that accompany the use of this medical
technology.
C. Explain the value of genetic variation within a
population. Predict a possible effect that this technology
could have, if unregulated, on human genetic variat
