Practice is the key to success in solving problems. As you practice, 
you can improve your skills by following these steps:
1.  
Analyze the problem. Read the problem carefully. What does 
it say? Draw a picture or diagram that will help you to visualize 
the problem. Write down both the data you are given and the 
quantity you need to obtain (the unknown).
2.  
Develop a plan for solving the problem. Consider a possi-
ble path between the given information and the unknown. What 
principles or equations relate the known data to the unknown? 
Recognize that some data may not be given explicitly in the prob-
lem; you may be expected to know certain quantities or l
