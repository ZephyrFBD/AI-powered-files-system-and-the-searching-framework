right triangle), that (use Eq. 21–13b)
Thus, from Eq. 21–14, the total impedance Z is
(21;15)
Also from Fig. 21–45, we can find the phase angle 
between voltage and current:
(21;16a)
and
(21;16b)
Figure 21–45 was drawn for the case 
and the current lags the source
voltage by 
When the reverse is true,
then 
in Eqs. 21–16 is less
than zero, and the current leads the source voltage.
We saw earlier that power is dissipated only by a resistance; none is dissipated
by inductance or capacitance. Ther
