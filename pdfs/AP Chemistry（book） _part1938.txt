 electrical insulators and are colorless (which 
implies a large band gap). However, if the backbone of the polymer has resonance 
 (Sections 8.6 and 9.6), the electrons can become delocalized over long distances, 
which can lead to semiconducting behavior in the polymer. Such “plastic electronics” 
are of great current interest for lightweight and flexible organic solar cells, organic tran-
sistors, organic light-emitting diodes, and other devices that are based on carbon rather 
than inorganic semiconductors like silicon (Figure 12.43).
12.9 ∣ Nanomaterials
The prefix nano means 10-9. 
 (Section 1.4) When people speak of “nanotechnology,” 
they usually mean making devices that are on the 1–100-nm scale. It turns out that the 
properties of semiconductors and metals change in this size range. Nanomaterials—
materials that have dimensions on the 1–100-nm scale—are under intense investiga-
tion in research laboratories around the world, and chemistry plays a central role in this
