Test What You Learned
1. A researcher uses a potometer to measure transpiration in plants.
How is it possible to measure transpiration using a tube attached
to the bottom of the plant?
Transpiration involves the loss of water through the leaves.
This water must be replaced and the potometer measures the
uptake of replacement water.
(A)
Transpiration involves the uptake of water through the roots.
This can be measured directly using a potometer.
(B)
Transpiration involves the loss of water through the leaves.
The tube must surround one or more leaves in order to
properly measure transpiration.
(C)
Transpiration involves the uptake of water through the roots.
This water is actively pushed out through the leaves and a
potometer measures this pressure.
(D)
2. A researcher wants to understand what factors cause a particular
species of plant to grow against buildings. He hypothesizes that
