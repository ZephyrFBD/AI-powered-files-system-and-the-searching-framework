as a cloverleaf, with an anticodon on one end, and the amino acid attachment site at the other. Amino-acid charging enzymes
ensure that the correct amino acid is attached to the correct tRNA. The anticodons on tRNA are complementary to the
codons on mRNA; for example, the anticodon AAA on tRNA corresponds to TTT on mRNA. Sequential amino acids are
linked by peptide bonds. The mRNA is translated, elongating the polypeptide, until a STOP or nonsense codon is reached.
When this happens, a release factor dissociates the components and frees the new polypeptide. Folding of the protein occurs
during and after translation. Once a polypeptide is synthesized, its role as a protein is established, such as determining a
physical phenotype of an organism.
