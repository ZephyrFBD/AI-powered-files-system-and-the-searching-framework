ly hot temperatures such as
geysers. Such bacteria are examples of extremophiles: organisms that thrive in extreme environments.
Temperature can limit the distribution of living things. Animals faced with temperature fluctuations may respond with
adaptations, such as migration, in order to survive. Migration, the movement from one place to another, is an adaptation
found in many animals, including many that inhabit seasonally cold climates. Migration solves problems related to
temperature, locating food, and finding a mate. In migration, for instance, the Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea) makes a
40,000 km (24,000 mi) round trip flight each year between its feeding grounds in the southern hemisphere and its breeding
grounds in the Arctic Ocean. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) live in the eastern United States in the warmer months
and migrate to Mexico and the southern United States in the wintertime. Some species of mammals also make migratory
forays. Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus)
