: 3 yellow : 1 green that was given in the text.
a.
12 offspring are white, as the W gene is epistatic
to the Y gene. Three offspring are yellow,
because w is not epistatic. Green offspring is
obtained when the recessive form of both genes
(wwyy) are present.
b.
12 offspring are white as W gene is hypostatic to
Y gene. Three offspring are yellow because Y is
epistatic to w. Green offspring is obtained when
the dominant form of both the genes (WWYY)
is present.
c.
12 offspring are white as W gene is dominant.
Three offspring are yellow because Y is
dominant and w is recessive. Green offspring is
obtained when the recessive form of both the
genes (wwyy) is present, showing codominance.
d.
12 offspring are white as W is epistatic to Y
gene. Three offspring are yellow because Y is
hypostatic to w. Green offspring is obtained
when the recessive form of both the genes
(wwyy) are present, showing codominance.
