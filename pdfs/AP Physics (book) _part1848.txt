ial lines or, in three
dimensions, equipotential surfaces.An equipotential surface is one on which all points
are at the same potential. That is, the potential difference between any two points
on the surface is zero, so no work is required to move a charge from one point on the
surface to the other. An equipotential surface must be perpendicular to the electric field
at any point. If this were not so—that is, if there were a component of 
parallel to
the surface—it would require work to move the charge along the surface against this
component of 
and this would contradict the idea that it is an equipotential surface.
The fact that the electric field lines and equipotential surfaces are mutually
perpendicular helps us locate the equipotentials when the electric field lines are
known. In a normal two-dimensional drawing, we show equipotential lines, which
are the intersections of equipotential surfaces with the plane of the drawing. In
Fig. 17–6, a few of the equipotential lines are dra
