from other molecules. Choice (A) is incorrect because
cyclic AMP functions as a secondary messenger. Protein kinases add phosphate groups to molecules, so choice
(B) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because adenylyl cyclase is the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of
cAMP.
8. (D) Insulin travels long distances through the circulatory system, so this is an example of endocrine signaling.
Choice (A) is incorrect because autocrine signaling involves a cell that produces a ligand, and the ligand then
binds to a receptor on the same cell that produced the ligand. Juxtacrine signaling is between cells that are in
direct contact, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (C) is incorrect because paracrine signaling occurs over short
distances.
9. (C) Signaling over short distances is paracrine signaling. Choice (A) is incorrect because autocrine signaling
involves a cell that produces a ligand and the ligand then binds to a receptor on the same cell that produced the
ligand. Juxtacrine signal
