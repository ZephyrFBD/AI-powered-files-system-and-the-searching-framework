is
infected/cancerous; it provides the appropriate template into which antigens can be loaded for recognition by
lymphocytes
leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules, such as histamine, in response to large pathogens and
allergens
antigen-specific B or T lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during the primary immune
response but that can immediately become an effector cell upon re-exposure to the same pathogen
type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages after it
moves into infected tissue
collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with epithelial tissue
lining the mucosa throughout the body
lymphocyte that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells
phagocytic leukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens
process that enhances phagocytosis using proteins to indicate the presence of a pathogen to phagocytic cells
transfer of antibodies from one individual to another to provide temporary protecti
