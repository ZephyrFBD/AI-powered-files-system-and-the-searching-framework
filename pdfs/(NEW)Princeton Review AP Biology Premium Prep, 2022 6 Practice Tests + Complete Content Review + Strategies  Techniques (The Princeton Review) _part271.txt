oints control cell cycle progression by regulating two families of proteins: cyclin-dependent
kinases (CDKs) and cyclins. To induce cell cycle progression, an inactive CDK binds a regulatory cyclin. Once
together, the complex is activated, can affect many proteins in the cell, and causes the cell cycle to continue. To
inhibit cell cycle progression, CDKs and cyclins are kept separate. CDKs and cyclins were first studied in yeast,
unicellular eukaryotic fungi. Budding yeast and fission yeast were good model organisms because they have only
one CDK protein each and a few different cyclins. This relatively simple system allowed biologists to figure out
how cell cycle progression is controlled. Their findings were then used to figure out how more complex eukaryotes
(such as mammals) control the cell cycle.

A cell losing control of the cell cycle can have disastrous consequences. For example, a mutation in a protein that
normally controls progression through the cell cycle can result
