Assume that this is a single EM wave, and calculate the maximum
values of E and B.

SOLUTION
From Eq. 22–2,
so
NOTE Although B has a small numerical value compared to E (because of the
way the different units for E and B are defined), B contributes the same energy
to the wave as E does, as we saw earl
