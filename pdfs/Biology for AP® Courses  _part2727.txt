Ground tissue is responsible for photosynthesis and support and is composed of parenchyma, collenchyma, and
sclerenchyma cells.
Primary growth occurs at the tips of roots and shoots, causing an increase in length. Woody plants may also exhibit
secondary growth, or increase in thickness. In woody plants, especially trees, annual rings may form as growth slows at
the end of each season. Some plant species have modified stems that help to store food, propagate new plants, or
discourage predators. Rhizomes, corms, stolons, runners, tubers, bulbs, tendrils, and thorns are examples of modified
stems.
23.3 Roots
Roots help to anchor a plant, absorb water and minerals, and serve as storage sites for food. Taproots and fibrous roots are
the two main types of root systems. In a taproot system, a main root grows vertically downward with a few lateral roots.
Fibrous root systems arise at the base of the stem, where a cluster of roots forms a dense network that is shallower than a
