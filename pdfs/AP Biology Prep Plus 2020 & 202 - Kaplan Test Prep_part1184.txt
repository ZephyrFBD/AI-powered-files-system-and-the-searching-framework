Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The fold change (log 10) for ste 2 with and without pheromone is 14 and 1.4,
respectively.

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The addition of yeast mating pheromone to the α-type cells is equivalent to
adding the supernatant from the co-culture to the a-type cells. Thus, the
results for α-type cells will be the same trend as a-type cells. The figure
shows the expression of a+ is 10 times more than a− for all three genes;
expression for ste 3 is approximately twice that of ste 12 and expression for
ste 2 is approximately twice that for ste 2. Since the expression of α+ and α−
for ste 3 was 7 and 0.7, the expression for ste 2 is most likely 2 × 7 = 14 and
2 × 0.7 = 1.4.
The fold change (log 10) for ste 2 with pheromone will be 10 times greater than that without
pheromone and twice that of ste 3.
