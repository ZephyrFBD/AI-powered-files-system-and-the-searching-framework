ature it is measuring. It is important
to be able to make needed corrections, as we saw in Example 19–17.
Other Meters
The meters described above are for direct current. A dc meter can be modified 
to measure ac (alternating current, Section 18–7) with the addition of diodes
(Chapter 29), which allow current to flow in one direction only. An ac meter can
be calibrated to read rms or peak values.
Voltmeters and ammeters can have several series or shunt resistors to offer a
choice of range. Multimeters can measure voltage, current, and resistance. Some-
times a multimeter is called a VOM (Volt-Ohm-Meter or Volt-Ohm-Milliammeter).
An ohmmeter measures resistance, and must contain a battery of known
voltage connected in series to a resistor 
and to an ammeter which contains a
shunt 
(Fig. 19–35). The resistor whose resistance is to be measured completes
the circuit, and must not be connected in a circuit containing a voltage source.
The needle deflection of the meter is inversely proportio
