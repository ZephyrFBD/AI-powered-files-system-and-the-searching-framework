 none else, there is no God beside me’
(Isaiah 45:5). I have quoted in other books a man who said he was
the unoﬃcial son of the late Baron Philippe de Rothschild of the
Mouton-Rothschild wine producing estates in France who died in
1988 and he told me about the Rothschild ‘revolt from God’. The
man said he was given the name Phillip Eugene de Rothschild and
we shared long correspondence many years ago while he was living
under another identity. He said that he was conceived through
‘occult incest’ which (within the Cult) was ‘normal and to be
admired’. ‘Phillip’ told me about his experience aĴending satanic
rituals with rich and famous people whom he names and you can
see them and the wider background to Cult Satanism in my other
books starting with The Biggest Secret. Cult rituals are interactions
with Archontic ‘gods’. ‘Phillip’ described Baron Philippe de
Rothschild as ‘a master Satanist and hater of God’ and he used the
same term ‘revolt from God’ associated with
Yaldabaoth/Satan/
