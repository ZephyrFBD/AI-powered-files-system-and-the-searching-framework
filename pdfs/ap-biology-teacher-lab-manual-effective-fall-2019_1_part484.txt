them to pictures of the chromosomes from cancer 
cells. For each case, count the number of chromosomes in each type of cell, and discuss 
their appearance. Then answer the following questions. 
•  Do your observations support your hypothesis? 
•  If not, what type of information might you need to know in order to understand your 
observations? 
•  If yes, what type of information can you find that would validate your conclusions?

■ Case 1: HeLa cells 
HeLa cells are cervical cancer cells isolated from a woman named Henrietta Lacks. 
Her cells have been cultured since 1951 and used in numerous scientific experiments. 
Henrietta Lacks died from her cancer not long after her cells were isolated. Lacks’s 
cancer cells contain remnants of human papillomavirus (HPV), which we now know 
increases the risk of cervical cancer. 
•  From your observations, what went wrong in Henrietta Lacks’s cervical cells that 
made them ca
