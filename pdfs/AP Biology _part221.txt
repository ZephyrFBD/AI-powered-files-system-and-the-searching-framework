(D) This description is exactly what NAD+ and FAD do. Choice A is
not correct because protons can only pass down their gradient
through ATP synthase channels. The entire production of ATP in
aerobic respiration depends on this fact. Choice B is not correct
because substrate level phosphorylation produces a small amount of
ATP during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Choice C is not
correct because the ETC is located in the matrix of mitochondria.

(B) Choice C represents glycolysis. Only a small amount of ATP is
produced by substrate level phosphorylation during glycolysis and
the Krebs cycle. The electron transport chain creates a proton
gradient by pumping protons across the cristae membrane, but no
ATP is created. Most ATP is produced by chemiosmosis as protons
flow through the ATP synthase channels. (ENE-1)
(A) Choice A accurately describes the coupled reactions in the ETC.
