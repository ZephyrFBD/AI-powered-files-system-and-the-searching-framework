sand, Yet in a minute had my spirit return'd, And I had breath'd a man,
made free from harm. But wherefore do I dally my revenge?-- Asteroth,

That, rolling down, may break the villain's bones, As he intended to
dismember me. Fly hence; despatch my charge immediately.
FREDERICK. Pity us, gentle Faustus! save our lives!
