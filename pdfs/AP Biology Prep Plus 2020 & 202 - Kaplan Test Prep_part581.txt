(B)
It is negative control because the gene is turned on and is
capable of being turned oﬀ.
(C)
It is an operon because operons are always controlled by
repressors.

3. The table below compares gene expression in larval honey bee
workers and queens. The honey bee genes were compared with
genes of known function in Drosophila melanogaster in order to
predict their functions within honey bees. The light bars represent
the percent of genes that are diﬀerentially expressed in queens.
The dark bars represent values for workers.
Based on this data, what can most reasonably be concluded
about the diﬀerence between queens and workers?

Expression Leads to Differential Hind Leg Development
between Honeybee Castes,” PLoS ONE 7, no. 7 (July

Workers may need to express a greater proportion of
regulatory genes than queens as they are exposed to so many
complex demands while outside of the hive.

Queens may need a lower pr
