integrated circuits (chips).
FIGURE 1;16 Problem 34.
You see a sailboat across a 
lake (not to scale). R is the 
radius of the Earth. Because
of the curvature of the Earth,
the water “bulges out” between
you and the boat.
35. (III) You are lying on a beach, your eyes 20 cm above the
sand. Just as the Sun sets, fully disappearing over the horizon,
you immediately jump up, your eyes now 150 cm above the
sand, and you can again just see the top of the Sun. If you count
the number of seconds 
until the Sun fully disappears
again, you can estimate the Earth’s radius. But for this Prob-
lem, use the known radius of the Earth to calculate the time t.
(= t)
46. How big is a ton? That is, what is the volume of something
that weighs a ton? To be specific, estimate the diameter of
a 1-ton rock, but first make a wild guess: will it be 1 ft
across, 3 ft, or the
