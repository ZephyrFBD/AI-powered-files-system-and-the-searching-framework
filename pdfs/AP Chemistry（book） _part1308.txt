ond strength versus bond length for N ¬ N bonds.
As the number of bonds between the carbon atoms increases, the bond length 
decreases and the bond enthalpy increases. That is, the carbon atoms are held more 
closely and more tightly together. In general, as the number of bonds between two atoms 
increases, the bond grows shorter and stronger. This trend is illustrated in Figure 8.16 for 
N¬N single, double, and triple bonds.

(d) Writing the chemical equation in terms of the 
Lewis structures of the molecules, we have:
(b) Carbon has four valence electrons, oxygen has six, 
and chlorine has seven, giving 4 + 6 + 2172 = 24 
electrons for the Lewis structures. Drawing a Lewis 
structure with all single bonds does not give the 
central carbon atom an octet. Using multiple 
bonds, we find that three structures satisfy the 
octet rule:
(c) Calculating the formal charges on each atom gives:
The first structure is expected to be th
