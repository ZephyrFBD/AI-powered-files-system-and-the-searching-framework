(Fig. 13–5b). When the
temperature is increased, the different amounts of expansion cause the bimetallic
strip to bend. Often the bimetallic strip is in the form of a coil, one end of which
is fixed while the other is attached to a pointer, Fig. 13–6. Such thermometers are
used as ordinary air thermometers, oven thermometers, automatic off switches 
in electric coffeepots, and in room thermostats for determining when the heater
or air conditioner should go on or off. Very precise thermometers make use of
electrical properties (Chapter 18), such as resistance thermometers, thermocouples,
and thermistors, often with a digital readout.
Temperature Scales
In order to measure temperature quantitatively, some sort of numerical scale must
be defined. The most common scale today is the Celsius or centigrade scale. In the
United States, the Fahrenheit scale is common. The most important scale in scientific
work is the absolute, or Kelvin, scale, and it will be discussed later in this Chapter.
