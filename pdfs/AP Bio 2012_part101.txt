orrect. The quantitative data provided in the scenario do not 
support this conclusion regarding changes in biomass for coyotes and hawks.
(B)
This option is correct. It demonstrates an understanding of the components 
of a food web and interactions between all of the participants. Coyotes prey 
on deer and rabbits, and if developers remove them, coyotes will lose their 
primary source of nutrition/energy. With this loss of nutrition/energy they 
will experience a decrease in reproductive success and therefore a significant 
decline in their population.
(C)
This option is incorrect. The data do not provide evidence to support the 
conclusion that with the removal of deer and rabbits the coyotes will switch to 
preying on voles and outcompeting hawks for the energy source.
(D)
This option is incorrect. The vole population may not suffer because there is 
no longer competition from rabbits and deer for the grass. With the removal of 
rabbits, hawks will lose a source of energy. However,
