all uncorrected errors are
passed from the parent cell to the daughter cells and amplified as each generation produces more non-functional proteins
from uncorrected DNA damage. Eventually, the pace of the cell cycle speeds up as the effectiveness of the control and
repair mechanisms decreases. Uncontrolled growth of the mutated cells outpaces the growth of normal cells in the area, and
a tumor (“-oma”) can result.
Proto-oncogenes
The genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto-oncogenes. Proto-oncogenes are normal genes
that, when mutated in certain ways, become oncogenes, genes that cause a cell to become cancerous. Consider what might
happen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene. In most instances, the alteration of the DNA sequence
will result in a less functional (or non-functional) protein. The result is detrimental to the cell and will likely prevent the cell
from completing the cell cycle; however, the organism is not harmed be
