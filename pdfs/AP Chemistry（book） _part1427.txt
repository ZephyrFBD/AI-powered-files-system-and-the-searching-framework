. There remains an unhybridized 2p orbital on carbon, 
perpendicular to the plane of the three sp2 hybrids.
The O atom also has three electron domains around it, and so 
we assume it has sp2 hybridization as well. One of these hybrid 
orbitals participates in the C ¬O s bond, while the other two 
hold the two nonbonding electron pairs of the O atom. Like the 
C atom, therefore, the O atom has a p orbital that is perpendicular 
to the plane of the molecule. The two p orbitals overlap to form a 
C ¬ O p bond (Figure 9.24).

▶Practice Exercise 1
We have just arrived at a bonding description for the formalde-
hyde molecule. Which of the following statements about the 
molecule is or are true?
(i)  
Two of the electrons in the molecule are used to make the p 
bond in the molecule.
(ii)  
Six of the electrons in the molecule are
