uspension culture to avoid inhaling any aerosol! 
Step 8 Using a 1–10 μL micropipette with a sterile tip, transfer 10 μL of the plasmid 
solution directly into the E. coli suspension in the “+ plasmid” tube. Tap tube with a finger 
to mix, but avoid making bubbles in the suspension or splashing the suspension up the 
sides of the tube. Do not add the plasmid solution into the “- plasmid” tube! (Why not?)

Step 9 Incubate both tubes (“+ plasmid” and “- plasmid”) on ice for 10 minutes. Make 
sure the bottom of the tubes make contact with the ice. 
Step 10 While the tubes are sitting on ice, label each of your agar plates on the bottom 
(not the lid) as directed by your teacher. 
Step 11 Following the 10-minute incubation at 0°C, remove the tubes from the ice and 
“heat shock” the cells in the tubes. It is critical that the cells receive a sharp and distinct 
shock! Make sure the tubes are closed tightly! Place the tubes into a test tube hol
