*P4 comes from P1, P2 and P3, and their relationship have been introduced in our model. 
 
Figure 4: According to P4’s change in every five years 
 
*The pecked lines represent the path before we plan to change, while the solid lines represent the 
path with our plan. The green lines stand for P4, the light blue lines stand for P2, the purple lines 
stand for P1 and the red lines stand for P3. 
What we conclude from the table and diagram above? Of course, all the indexes 
are stably growth in every five years. From the diagram, we could see that P1 increase 
rapidly and all the indexes may over 0.4 in the near future, except that P3 is a little 
low for its reason.
