r that appears to have contributed to the problem 
is a drop in the pH of the water, from 8.0 in December 2014 to 7.3 in 
August 2015. Because the insoluble lead salts that form the passivat-
ing layer, like Pb31PO422, PbHSO4, and PbCO3, contain anions that 
can act as weak bases, anything that makes the water more acidic 
increases their solubility.
Another contributing factor was the presence of high levels 
of chloride ions. The treated water from Detroit had chloride lev-
els of about 11 ppm, whereas the treated Flint water had chloride 
levels of 85 ppm in August 2015. While PbCl2 is fairly insoluble 
1Ksp = 1.7 * 10 - 52, high concentrations of chloride ions can lead to 
the formation of soluble complex ions such as PbCl3
-  and PbCl4
2 - . 
The increased chloride levels were due in part to the addition of FeCl3, 
which was used to help coagulate and Ô¨Ålter out unwanted organic 
matter that was leading to problems with E. coli contamination. 
Chloride ions are also produced when u
