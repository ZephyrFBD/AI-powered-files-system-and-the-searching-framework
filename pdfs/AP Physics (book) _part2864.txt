e
used if the image is to fill the 24-mm height of the sensor?
7. (II) A 200-mm-focal-length lens can be adjusted so that it
is 200.0 mm to 208.2 mm from the film. For what range of
object distances can it be adjusted?
8. (II) How large is the image of the Sun on film used in a
camera with (a) a 28-mm-focal-length lens, (b) a 50-mm-
focal-length lens, and (c) a 135-mm-focal-length lens? (d) If
the 50-mm lens is considered normal for this camera, what
relative magnification does each of the other two lenses
provide? The Sun has diameter 
and it is
away.
9. (II) If a 135-mm telephoto lens is designed to cover object
distances from 1.30 m to 
over what distance must the
lens move relative to the plane of the sensor or film?
10. (III) Show that for objects very far away (assume infinity),
the magnification of any camera lens is proportional to its
focal length.

11. (I) A human eyeball is about 2.0 cm long and the pupil has
a maximum diameter of about 8.0 mm.
