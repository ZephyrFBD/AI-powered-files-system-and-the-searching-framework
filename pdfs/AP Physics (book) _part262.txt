s moving through the air in two dimensions near the
Earth’s surface, such as a golf ball, a thrown or batted baseball, kicked footballs,
and speeding bullets. These are all examples of projectile motion (see Fig. 3–17),
which we can describe as taking place in two dimensions if there is no wind.
Although air resistance is often important, in many cases its effect can be
ignored, and we will ignore it in the following analysis. We will not be concerned 
now with the process by which the object is thrown or projected. We consider only 
its motion after it has been projected, and before it lands or is caught—that is,
we analyze our projected object only when it is moving freely through the air under
the action of gravity alone. Then the acceleration of the object is that due to gravity,
which acts downward with magnitude 
and we assume it is constant.†
Galileo was the first to describe projectile motion accurately. He showed that
it could be understood by analyzing the horizontal and vert
