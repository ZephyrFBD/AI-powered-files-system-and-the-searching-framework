orporated into NADPH. The loss of
these two electrons from PS II is
 
replaced when H2O is split into two electrons, 2 H+ and ½O2. The two electrons from H2O replace the lost
electrons from PS II, one of the H+
 
provides the H in NADPH, and the ½O2 contributes to the oxygen gas
 
that is released.
 
In summary, photophosphorylation takes the energy in light and the
 
electrons in H2O to make the energy-rich molecules ATP and NADPH.
Because the reactions require light, they are often called the lightdependent reactions or, simply, light reactions.
The following equation informally summarizes the process:
H2O + ADP + Pi + NADP+ + light → ATP + NADPH + O2+ H+

Cyclic Photophosphorylation
A second photophosphorylation sequence (shown in Figure 5-1) occurs when the electrons energized in PS I are
“recycled.” In this sequence, energized electrons from PS I join with protein carriers and generate ATP as they pass
along the electron transport chain. In contrast to noncyclic photoph
