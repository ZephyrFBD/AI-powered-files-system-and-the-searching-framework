ther amines, these substances are weak 
bases; the amine nitrogen is readily protonated upon treatment with 
an acid. The resulting products are called acid salts. If we use A as the 
abbreviation for an amine, the acid salt formed by reaction with hy-
drochloric acid can be written AH+Cl-. It can also be written as A # HCl 
and referred to as a hydrochloride. Amphetamine hydrochloride, for 
example, is the acid salt formed by treating amphetamine with HCl:

hydrochloride is a major active ingredient.
Acid salts are much less volatile, more stable, and generally more 
water soluble than the corresponding amines. For this reason, many 
drugs that are amines are sold and administered as acid salts. Some 
examples of over-the-counter medications that contain amine hydro-
