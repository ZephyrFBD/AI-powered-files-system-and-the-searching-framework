Properties of Nitrogen
Nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas composed of N2 molecules. The N2 molecule 
is very unreactive because of the strong triple bond between nitrogen atoms (the N â€šN 
bond enthalpy is 941 kJ>mol, nearly twice that for the bond in O2. 
 (Table 8.3) When 
substances burn in air, they normally react with O2 but not with N2.
The electron configuration of the nitrogen atom is 3He42s22p3. The element exhibits 
all formal oxidation states from +5 to -3 (Table 22.6). The +5, 0, and -3 oxidation states 
are the most common and generally the most stable of these. Because nitrogen is more 
electronegative than all other elements except fluorine, oxygen, and chlorine, it exhibits 
positive oxidation states only in combination with these three elements.
Production and Uses of Nitrogen
Elemental nitrogen is obtained in commercial quantities by fractional distillation of liq-
uid air. Because of its low reac
