sophyll cells (Figure 23.34), thereby increasing the pull on the water in the xylem
vessels. The xylem vessels and tracheids are structurally adapted to cope with large changes in pressure. Rings in the vessels
maintain their tubular shape, much like the rings on a vacuum cleaner hose keep the hose open while it is under pressure.
Small perforations between vessel elements reduce the number and size of gas bubbles that can form via a process called
cavitation. The formation of gas bubbles in xylem interrupts the continuous stream of water from the base to the top of the
plant, causing a break termed an embolism in the flow of xylem sap. The taller the tree, the greater the tension forces needed
to pull water, and the more cavitation events. In larger trees, the resulting embolisms can plug xylem vessels, making them
non-functional.
Figure 23.34 The cohesionâ€“tension theory of sap ascent is shown. Evaporation from the mesophyll cells
produces a negative water potential gradient that caus
