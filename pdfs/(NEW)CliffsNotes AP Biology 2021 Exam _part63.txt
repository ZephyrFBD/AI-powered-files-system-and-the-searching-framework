enzymes begin
to lose their ability to catalyze reactions as they become denatured, that is, they lose their threedimensional shape as
hydrogen bonds and peptide bonds begin to break down. Most enzymes have an optimal pH of around 7.0; however,
the enzyme pepsin, which digests proteins in the stomach, becomes active only at a low pH (very acidic).
The standard suffix for enzymes is â€œ-ase, " so it is easy to identify enzymes that use this ending, although some do
not.
The induced-fit model describes how enzymes work. Within the protein (the enzyme), there is an active site with
which the reactants readily interact because of the shape, polarity, or other characteristics of the active site. The
interaction of the reactants (substrate) and the enzyme causes the enzyme to change shape. The new position places
the substrate molecules into a position favorable to their reaction. Once the reaction takes place, the product is
released.
