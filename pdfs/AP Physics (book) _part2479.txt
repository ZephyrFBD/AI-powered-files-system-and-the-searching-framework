the 3.0-m wavelength of this station. FM antennas are typically 1.5 m long, or about
a half wavelength. This length is chosen so that the antenna reacts in a resonant
fashion and thus is more sensitive to FM frequencies. AM radio antennas would
have to be very long and impractical to be either

Other EM Wave Communications
The various regions of the radio-wave spectrum are assigned by governmental 
agencies for various purposes. Besides those mentioned above, there are “bands”
assigned for use by ships, airplanes, police, military, amateurs, satellites and space,
and radar. Cell phones, for example, are complete radio transmitters and receivers.
In the U.S., CDMA cell phones function on two different bands: 800 MHz and 
1900 MHz 
Europe, Asia, and much of the rest of the world use a dif-
ferent system: the international standard called GSM
