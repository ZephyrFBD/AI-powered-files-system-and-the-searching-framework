“But I’m Too Young!” is a case from The National Center for Case Study Teaching 
in Science. The case discusses cell cycle control as it relates to ovarian cancer and has 
additional references.

“Life After Death: An Activity to Investigate the Scientific, Legal, & Racial Issues of the 
Henrietta Lacks Story” describes how students can prepare and observe chromosomes 
from normal and HeLa cells. It includes investigations into the history of Henrietta Lacks 
and her cells2. CellServ has a kit involving normal and HeLa cells (https://faes.org/
