reases as the lungs become stiff
and less pliable, decreasing further when there is
increased resistance in the lung.
26. Amphibians, such as frogs, breathe by collecting air in
a pouch below their throat. Muscles then contract the
pouch and force air into their lungs. How does this differ
from inhalation in humans and other mammals?
a.
Inhalation in humans and other mammals
involves the openings called spiracles, which
connect to the tubular network to allow the
oxygen to pass into the body.
b.
Inhalation in humans and other mammals
involve direct diffusion across the outer
membrane to meet oxygen requirements. Gases
can diffuse quickly through direct diffusion.
c.
Inhalation in humans and other mammals
involve contracting the thoracic cavity by
creating negative pressure in the lungs, which
causes air to diffuse into the lungs.
d.
Inhalation in humans and other mammals
involves expanding the thoracic cavity by
creating negative pressure in the lungs, which
causes air to diffuse into
