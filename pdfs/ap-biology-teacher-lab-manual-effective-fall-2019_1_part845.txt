Figure A.20 
Having found, as shown in Figure A.20, the five points for our rate graph, we are faced 
with the question of whether or not it is legitimate to connect these points with a

smooth line. We recognize, of course, that both temperature and rate are continuous 
processes. Between any two given temperatures or rates there are an infinite number 
of temperatures or rates. The question here, however, is the following: If we do draw a 
smooth line through our five points, will that line pass through the infinite number of 
other rates that we could have measured if we had chosen some other temperature? Let 
us go ahead and draw the line, as shown in Figure A.21
