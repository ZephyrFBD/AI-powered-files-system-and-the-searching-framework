STAGES OF TRANSCRIPTION
Initiation
The first stage of transcription is initiation. During this stage, RNA
polymerase binds to the promoter located upstream from the genes to
be “read.” The bound RNA polymerase causes DNA to unwind, exposing a
single-strand that serves as the template for transcription.
One of the most common elements in eukaryotic promoters is the TATA
box. Although not present in “housekeeping genes” and other
developmental genes, such as the homeotic genes, TATA boxes are A-T-
rich regions of DNA that are involved in positioning the start of
