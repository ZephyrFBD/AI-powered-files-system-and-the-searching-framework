The structure of borazine, B3N3H6, is a six-membered ring 
of alternating B and N atoms. There is one H atom bonded 
to each B and to each N atom. The molecule is planar. 
 
(a) Write a Lewis structure for borazine in which the for-
mal charge on every atom is zero. (b) Write a Lewis struc-
ture for borazine in which the octet rule is satisfied for 
every atom. (c) What are the formal charges on the atoms 
in the Lewis structure from part (b)? Given the electro-
negativities of B and N, do the formal charges seem favor-
able or unfavorable? (d) Do either of the Lewis structures 
in parts (a) and (b) have multiple resonance structures? 
 
(e) What are the hybridizations at the B and N atoms in
