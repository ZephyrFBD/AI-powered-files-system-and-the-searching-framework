n’ the perfect attendance in our section. If you’re not there next 
 
 Friday I’ll give you a good thump in the gob, do you hear me? 
 
 Uncle Pat says, Go ’way, go ’way, or I’ll walk on you. 
 
 Ah, shut up,Mr. Stupid that was dropped on your head. He pushes 
 
 Uncle Pat on the shoulder and knocks him back against the wall. I drop 
 
 the papers and run at him but he steps aside and punches me on the 
 
 back of the neck and my forehead is rammed into the wall and it puts 
 
 me in such a rage I can’t see him anymore. I go at him with arms and 
 
 legs and if I could tear his face off with my teeth I would but he has 
 
 long arms like a gorilla and he just keeps pushing me away so that I can’t 
 
 touch him. He says,You mad feckin’ eejit. I’ll destroy you in the Confraternity, 
 
 and he runs away. 
 
 Uncle Pat says,You shouldn’t be fightin’ like that an’ you dropped 
 
 all me papers an’ some o’ them is wet an’ how am I supposed to sell wet 
 
 papers, and I wanted to jump on him
