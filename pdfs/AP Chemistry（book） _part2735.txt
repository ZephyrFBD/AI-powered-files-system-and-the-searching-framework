lence point when pKa is 10 or higher because the pH change is too small and 
gradual.
pH titration experiments are an excellent way to measure the pKa of a weak acid. 
Look at Figure 17.11. Notice that for each acid solution, 50 mL of strong base is required 
to reach the equivalence point. This means, of course, that 50 mL of base is required to 
 
convert the HA molecules into A- conjugate base anions. Also notice that halfway 
 
to each equivalence point (at 25 mL base added), the pH of the solution is nearly equal 
to the pKa of the acid. Is this a coincidence? No! Recall that Ka = 3H+43A-4>3HA4, where 
all concentrations are those at equilibrium. Halfway to the equiv-
alence point, half of 3HA4 has been converted to 3A-4. In other 
words, 3HA4 = 3A-4. Therefore, 3HA4>3A-4 = 1. In which case, 
Ka = 3H+4, and therefore pKa = pH.
It becomes possible, then, to determine the pKa of a weak 
acid from its pH titration curve. Once you identify the amount 
of base needed to reach the equiv
