Often, we do not know the equilibrium concentrations of all species in an equilibrium 
mixture. If we know the initial concentrations and the equilibrium concentration of at 
least one species, however, we can generally use the stoichiometry of the reaction to deduce 
the equilibrium concentrations of the others. The following steps outline the procedure:
How to Determine Concentrations of Unknown Species in an Equilibrium Mixture
 
1. Tabulate all known initial and equilibrium concentrations of the species that 
appear in the equilibrium-constant expression.
 
2. For those species for which initial and equilibrium concentrations are known, cal-
culate the change in concentration that occurs as the system reaches equilibrium.
 
3. Use the stoichiometry of the reaction (that is, the coefficients in the balanced 
chemical equation) to calculate the changes in concentration
