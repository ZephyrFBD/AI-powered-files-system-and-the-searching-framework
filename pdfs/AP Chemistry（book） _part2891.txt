arbons as pollutants. These organic compounds are the principal compo-
nents of gasoline and of many compounds we use as fuel (propane, C3H8, and butane, C4H10; 
for example), but are major ingredients of smog. A typical engine without effective emission 
controls emits about 10 to 15 g of hydrocarbons per mile. Current standards require that 
hydrocarbon emissions be less than 0.075 g>mi. Hydrocarbons are also emitted naturally 
from living organisms (see A Closer Look box later in this section).
Reduction or elimination of smog requires that the ingredients essential to its for-
mation be removed from automobile exhaust. Catalytic converters reduce the levels of 
NOx and hydrocarbons, two of the major ingredients of smog. (See the Chemistry Put to 
Work: Catalytic Converters in Section 14.7.)

largely by the action of sunlight on vehicle exhaust 
gases, as illustrated in this photo of Beijing, China.
