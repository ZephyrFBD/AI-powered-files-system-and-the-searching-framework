 Ultimate Causes of Behavior
Behaviors are responses to stimuli. They can either be instinctual/innate behaviors, which are not influenced by the
environment, or learned behaviors, which are influenced by environmental changes. Instinctual behaviors include mating
systems and methods of communication. Learned behaviors include imprinting and habituation, conditioning, and, most
powerfully, cognitive learning. Although the connection between behavior, genetics, and evolution is well established, the
explanation of human behavior as entirely genetic is controversial.
