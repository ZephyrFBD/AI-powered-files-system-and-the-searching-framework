or the greater density of HgSe. 
 
12.63 (a) Cs+ and I- have the most similar radii and will adopt the 
CsCl-type structure. The radii of Na+ and I- are somewhat different; 
NaI will adopt the NaCl-type structure. The radii of Cu+ and I- are 
very different; CuI has the ZnS-type structure. (b) CsI, 8; NaI, 6; CuI, 
4 12.65 (a) 6 (b) 3 (c) 6 12.67 (a) False (b) true 12.69 (a) Ionic sol-
ids are much more likely to dissolve in water. (b) Covalent-network 
solids can become considerably better conductors of electricity via 
chemical substitution. 12.71 (a) CdS (b) GaN (c) GaAs 12.73 Ge or 
Si (Ge is closer to Ga in bonding atomic radius.) 12.75 (a) A 1.1 eV 
photon corresponds to a wavelength of 1.1 * 10-6 M (b) According 
to the Ô¨Ågure, Si can absorb all wavelengths in the visible portion of 
the solar spectrum. (c) Si absorbs wavelengths less than 1,100 nm. 
This corresponds to approximately 80-90% of the total area under 
the curve. 12.77 The emitted light has a wavelength of 713 nm. Th
