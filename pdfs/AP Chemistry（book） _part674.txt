ree unlabeled bot-
tles, each containing white powder. Near these bottles are three 
loose labels: “Sodium sulfide,” “Sodium bicarbonate,” and “Sodium 
chloride.” Let’s design an experiment to figure out which label goes 
with which bottle.
(a) You could try to use the physical properties of the three solids 
to distinguish among them. Using an Internet resource or the CRC 
Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, look up the melting points, aque-
ous solubilities, or other properties of these salts. Are the differences 
among these properties for each salt large enough to distinguish 
among them? If so, design a set of experiments to distinguish each 
salt and therefore figure out which label goes on which bottle.
(b) You could use the chemical reactivity of each salt to distinguish 
it from the others. Which of these salts, if any, will act as an acid? A 
base? A strong electrolyte? Can any of these salts be easily oxidized or 
reduced? Can any of these salts react to produce a gas? Based
