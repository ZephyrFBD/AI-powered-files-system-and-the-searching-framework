Linear Expansion
Experiments indicate that the change in length 
of almost all solids is, to a good
approximation, directly proportional to the change in temperature 
as long as
is not too large. The change in length is also proportional to the original
length of the object,
That is, for the same temperature increase, a 4-m-long
iron rod will increase in length twice as much as a 2-m-long iron rod. We can
write this proportionality as an equation:
(13;1a)
where 
the proportionality constant, is called the coefficient of linear expansion
for the particular material and has units of 
We write 
Fig. 13–9, and rewrite this equation as
(13;1b)
where 
is the length initially, at temperature 
and is the length after heating
or cooling to a temperature T. If the temperature change 
is nega-
tive, then 
is also negative; the length shortens as the temperature
decreases.
