omewhat well. But many sounds only last milliseconds, like the initial
attack of a piano note or plucked guitar string. Many audiophiles hear the difference
between an original vinyl record and its subsequent release as a CD at 44.1 kHz.
Digital audio signals must be converted back to analog (digital-to-analog converter,
DAC) before being sent to a loudspeaker or headset. Even in a TV, the digital
signals are converted to analog voltages before addressing the pixels (next 
Section), although the picture itself might be said to be digital since it is made up
of separate pixels.
Digital photographs are made up of millions of “pixels” to produce a sharp
image that is not “pixelated” or blurry. Also important (and complicated) are the
number of bits provided for colors, plus the ability of the sensors (Chapter 25) to
sustain a wide range of brightnesses under dim and bright light conditions.
Digital data has some real advantages: for one, it can be compressed, in the
sense that repeated in
