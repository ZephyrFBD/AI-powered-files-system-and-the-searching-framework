culating the bond order, we can use 
Figure 9.43 to estimate the bond enthalpy and bond length.
Solve
(a) The O2
+ ion has 11 valence electrons, one fewer than O2. The 
electron removed from O2 to form O2
+ is one of the two un-
paired p
2p
*  electrons (see Figure 9.43). Therefore, O2
+ has one 
unpaired electron.
(b) The molecule has eight bonding electrons (the same as O2) 
and three antibonding electrons (one fewer than O2). Thus, its 
bond order is

218 - 32 = 21

CHAPTER 9 Molecular Geometry and Bonding Theories
Heteronuclear Diatomic Molecules
The principles we have used in developing an MO description of homonuclear diatomic 
molecules can be extended to heteronuclear diatomic molecules—those in which the two 
atoms in the molecule are not the same. We conclude this section with a fascinating het-
eronuclear diatomic molecule—nitric oxide, NO.
The NO molecule controls several important human physiological functions. Our bod-
ies use it, for example, to relax mu
