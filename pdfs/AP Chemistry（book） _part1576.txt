rs, respectively. However, other units can be used. In countries other 
than the United States, the pascal is the most commonly used unit for pressure. Table 10.2 
shows the numerical value for R in various units. In working with the ideal-gas equation, 
you must choose the form of R in which the units agree with the units of P, V, n, and T 
given in the problem. In this chapter, we will most often use R = 0.08206 L@atm>mol@K 
because pressure is most often given in atmospheres.
Suppose we have 1.000 mol of an ideal gas at 1.000 atm and 0.00 °C 1273.15 K2. 
According to the ideal-gas equation, the volume of the gas is
V = nRT

The conditions 0 °C and 1 atm are referred to as standard temperature and pressure 
(STP). The volume occupied by 1 mol of ideal gas at STP
, 22.41 L, is known as the molar 
volume of an ideal gas at STP
.
