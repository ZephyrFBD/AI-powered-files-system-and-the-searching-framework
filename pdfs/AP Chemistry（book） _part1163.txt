In the net ionic equation, nitric acid is a strong acid and 
Bi1NO323 is a soluble salt, so we need to show only the reaction 
of the solid with the hydrogen ion forming the Bi3+1aq2 ion 
and water. To calculate the concentration of the solution, we 
proceed as follows (Section 4.5):
6.77 g Bi2O3
0.500 L soln *
1 mol Bi2O3
466.0 g Bi2O3
*
2 mol Bi3+
1 mol Bi2O3 
= 0.0581 mol Bi3+
L soln
= 0.0581 M
(e) Recall that the atomic number of any element is the number 
of protons and electrons in a neutral atom of the element. 
 (Section 2.3) Bismuth is element 83; there are therefore 
83 protons in the nucleus. Because the atomic mass number is 
209, there are 209 - 83 = 126 neutrons in the nucleus.
(f) We can use the density and the atomic weight to determine 
the number of moles of Bi, and then use Avogadroâ€™s number to 
convert the result to the number of atoms.  
 (Sections 1.4 and 3.4) The volume of the cube is 
15.0023 cm3 = 125 cm3. Then we have
 125 cm3 Bi *
9.808 g Bi
1 cm3
