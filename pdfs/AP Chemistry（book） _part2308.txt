Given the following diagrams at t = 0 min and 
 
t = 30 min, what is the half-life of the reaction if it fol-
lows first-order kinetics?
t = 0 min
t = 30 min
(b) After four half-life periods for a first-order reaction, 
what fraction of reactant remains? [Section 14.4]
 
14.8 Which of the following linear plots do you expect for a 
reaction A ¡ products if the kinetics are (a) zero order, 
(b) first order, or (c) second order? [Section 14.4]

components indicated by the boxes. [Section 14.5]
 14.11 The following graph shows two different reaction path-
ways for the same overall reaction at the same tempera-
ture. Is each of the following statements true or false? 
 
(a) The rate is faster for the red path than for the blue 
path. (b) For both paths, the rate of the reverse reaction 
is slower than the rate of the forward reaction. (c) The en-
ergy change ∆E is the same for both paths. [Sectio
