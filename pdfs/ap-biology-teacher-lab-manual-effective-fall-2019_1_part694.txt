ments on the 
pipette. Assembly of potometers can be challenging; as a result, you might opt to suggest 
that students use the whole plant method to determine transpiration rates. However, 
keep in mind that although students might struggle as they assemble equipment, in the 
process they are learning new lab skills and will experience satisfying “ah-ha” moments 
when they are finally successful. 
Students are asked to investigate methods for calculating leaf surface area. However, 
it is recommended that students use the leaf tracing method described in the following 
paragraph. Using a common alternate method, leaf mass, presents several inherent 
problems. The method is dependent upon the part of the leaf from which a section is 
cut because leaves usually have variation in thickness; thus, the calculated surface area 
of a 1-cm2 section could vary significantly from one group to another. A modified leaf 
tracing method can be done without removing leaves from the plant, thus render
