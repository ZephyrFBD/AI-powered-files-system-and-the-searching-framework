, sapon. Naturally occurring esters include fats 
and oils, and in making soap an animal fat or a vegetable oil is boiled with a strong base. 
The resultant soap consists of a mixture of salts of long-chain carboxylic acids (called fatty 
acids), which form during the saponification reaction.
In a basic aqueous solution, esters react with hydroxide ion to form the salt of the carboxylic acid and the alcohol from which the 
ester is constituted. Name each of the following esters, and indicate the products of their reaction with aqueous base.

Sample Exercise 24.6 
Naming Esters and Predicting Hydrolysis Products
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given two esters and asked to name them and to 
predict the products formed when they undergo hydrolysis (split 
into an alcohol and carboxylate ion) in basic solution.
Plan Esters are formed by the condensation reaction between an 
alcohol and a carboxylic acid. To name an ester, we must analyze its 
structure and deter
