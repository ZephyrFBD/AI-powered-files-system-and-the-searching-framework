LIQUID CRYSTALS (SECTION 11.7) A liquid crystal is a substance 
that exhibits one or more ordered phases at a temperature above the 
melting point of the solid. In a nematic liquid crystal the molecules 
are aligned along a common direction, but the ends of the mole-
cules are not lined up. In a smectic liquid crystal the ends of the mol-
ecules are lined up so that the molecules form layers. In smectic A 
liquid crystals the long axes of the molecules line up perpendicular to 
the layers. In smectic C liquid crystals the long axes of molecules are 
inclined with respect to the layers. A cholesteric liquid crystal is com-
posed of molecules that align parallel to each other within a layer, as 
they do in nematic liquid crystalline phases, but the direction along 
which the long axes of the molecules align rotates from one layer 
to the next to form a helical structure. Substances that form liquid 
crystals are general
