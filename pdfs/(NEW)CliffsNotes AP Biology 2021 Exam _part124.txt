phosphate group. Such phosphorylation occurs during glycolysis, the initial breakdown process of glucose
(discussed later in this chapter).
2. Oxidative phosphorylation occurs when a phosphate group is added to ADP to form ATP, but the energy for the
bond does not accompany the phosphate group. Instead, electrons give up energy for generating ATP during each
step of a process, where electrons are transferred from one molecule (electron carrier) to another in a chain of
reactions.
Cellular respiration is the ATP-generating process that occurs in cells. As previewed earlier, energy is extracted
from energy-rich glucose to form ATP. The chemical equation describing this process is:
C6H12O6 + 6 O2 â†’ 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + energy C6H12O6is glucose, but sometimes you see CH2O or (CH2O)n.
These are
 
general formulas for glucose or any carbohydrate.
When oxygen is available, most cells will generate ATP by aerobic respiration. There are three steps that occur in
this ATP generating pathway:
1. Glyco
