rs (Fig. 11–39b), crests of one wave
repeatedly meet troughs of the other wave and the two waves are said to be 
completely out of phase or, more precisely, out of phase by one-half wavelength (or
180 ).† That is, the crests of one wave occur a half wavelength behind the crests of the
other wave. The relative phase of the two water waves in Fig. 11–38 in most areas
is intermediate between these two extremes, resulting in partially destructive
interference, as illustrated in Fig.11–39c. If the amplitudes of two interfering waves
are not equal, fully destructive interference (as in Fig. 11–39b) does not occur.

FIGURE 11–38 (a) Interference of water waves. (b) Constructive interference occurs where one wave’s
maximum (a crest) meets the other’s maximum. Destructive interference (“flat water”) occurs where one
wave’s maximum (a crest) meets the other’s miminum (a trough).
