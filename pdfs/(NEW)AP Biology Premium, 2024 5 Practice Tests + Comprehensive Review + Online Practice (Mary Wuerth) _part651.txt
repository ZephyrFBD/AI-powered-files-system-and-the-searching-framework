(a) Describe the role of stomata in water regulation and photosynthesis in plants.
(b) Construct a graph that shows the mean stomatal density for both the upper and lower leaf surfaces of both
plants. Be sure to include 95% confidence intervals.
(c) Analyze the data to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in the mean stomatal
densities between the two plants.
(d) Make a claim explaining why the mean stomatal density on the upper surface of the leaves of Passiflora
incarnata is different than the mean stomatal density on the upper surface of the leaves of Quercus alba.
Justify your claim with your knowledge of the role stomata play in water regulation and photosynthesis in
plants.
