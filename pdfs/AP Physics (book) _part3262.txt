ution for a
classical gas (Section 13–10). The energy of the state at the Fermi level is called
the Fermi energy,
For copper,
This is very much greater than
the energy of thermal motion at room temperature (
Eq. 13–8). Clearly, all motion does not stop at absolute zero.
At 
all states with energy below 
are occupied, and all states above
are empty. What happens for 
We expect that at least some of the
electrons will increase in energy due to thermal motion. Figure 29–22 shows the
density of occupied states for 
a temperature at which a metal is so
hot it would glow. We see that the distribution differs very little from that at
We see also that the changes that do occur are concentrated about the
Fermi level. A few electrons from slightly below the Fermi level move to energy
states slightly above it. The average energy of the electrons increases only very
slightly when the temperature is increased from 
to 
This is
very different from the behavior of an ideal gas, for which kinetic ener
