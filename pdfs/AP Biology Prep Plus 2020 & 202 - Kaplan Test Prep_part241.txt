2. Researchers are developing a way to produce clean drinking water
using plant tissues. Which of the following strategies would
probably be most successful, and why?
Because periderm forms an outer ring of tissue around a
plant stem, it can be used to create a straw-like structure to
transport water.
(A)
Because xylem transports water in plants, water could be
pushed through it with the natural structure of the xylem
acting as a filter.
(B)
Because phloem consists of dead tissue, it forms straw-like
structures that can be used to filter water.
(C)
Because the cortex consists of living tissue, it can be used to
actively pump water through a membrane.
(D)
3. To improve crop yields, a researcher decides to study the eï¬€ects
of light on factors related to photosynthesis in plants. In his study,
he examines stomata under the microscope under light and dark
conditions and measures changes in sugar concentrations. Which
of the following provides the most plausible hyp
