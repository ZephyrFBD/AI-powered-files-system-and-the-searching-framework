ind signal transduction pathway blockage,
making it correct. (A) is incorrect because, by binding the receptors,
antihistamines block the pathway initiated when histamine binds.
Similarly, (B) is incorrect because, by binding to the ErbB-2 receptor,
Trastuzumab limits the amount of actual ErbB-2 that are able to bind,
helping to limit the excessive cell growth seen in breast cancer
patients. (D) is incorrect because, by blocking voltage-gated calcium
channels, Felodipine is not allowing the signal, and therefore the
calcium, to enter the cell and aﬀect cellular function.

Learning Objective: 8.5
The communication that occurs between the immune cells in the
question stem is dependent on the ability of the two cells to share
particles. (D) presents the only cell junction that allows for the flow of
materials between cells, making it correct. Desmosomes and
anchoring junctions are integral for keeping cells in close proximity
with each other, but they do not provide a mechanism for ma
