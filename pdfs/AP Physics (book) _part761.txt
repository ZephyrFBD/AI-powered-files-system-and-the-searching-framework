(a) They have the same momentum and the same KE.
(b) The car has more momentum and more KE than the truck.
(c) The truck has more momentum and more KE than the car.
(d) They have the same momentum, but the car has more
kinetic energy than the truck.
(e) They have the same kinetic energy, but the truck has
more momentum than the car.
10. Choose the best answer in the previous Question (# 9) but 
now assume that you push both the car and the truck for the
same distance with the same force. [Hint: See also Chapter 6.]
