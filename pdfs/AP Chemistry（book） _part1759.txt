or pressure for four liquids as a function of 
temperature.
Give It Some Thought
Which compound do you think is more volatile at 25 Â°C: CCl4 or CBr4?
by the vapor in the space above the liquid increases. After a short 
time, the pressure of the vapor attains a constant value, which we 
call the vapor pressure.
At any instant, some of the ethanol molecules at the liquid 
surface possess sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the attractive 
forces of their neighbors and, therefore, escape into the gas phase. 
As the number of gas-phase molecules increases, however, the prob-
ability increases that a molecule in the gas phase will strike the liq-
uid surface and be recaptured by the liquid, as shown in the flask 
on the right in Figure 11.23. Eventually, the rate at which molecules 
return to the liquid equals the rate at which they escape. The num-
ber of molecules in the gas phase then reaches a steady value, and 
the pressure exerted by the vapor becomes constant.
