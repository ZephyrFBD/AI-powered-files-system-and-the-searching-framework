nd 16-bit resolution, meaning each sampled voltage can have
different voltage levels between, say, 0 and 5 volts. See Fig. 17–25 for details.
Audio recording today typically uses 96 kHz and 24-bit (
voltage
levels) to give a better approximation of the original analog signal (on super-CDs
or solid-state memory), but must be transferred down to 44.1 kHz and 16-bit to
produce ordinary CDs. (DVDs can use 192 kHz sampling rate for sound.) But
iPods and MP3 players have lower sampling rates and much less detail, which many
listeners can notice.

FIGURE 17–25  The sine wave shown could represent the analog electric 
signal from a microphone due to a pure 2000-Hz tone. (See Chapters 11 
and 12.) The analog-to-digital electronics samples the signal—that is,
measures and records the signal’s voltage at intervals, many times per second.
Each dot on the curve represents the voltage measured (sampled) at that 
point. The sampling rate in this diagram is 44,100
