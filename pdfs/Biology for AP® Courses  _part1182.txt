n
regulatory molecule that exhibits negative effects on the cell cycle by interacting with a
transcription factor (E2F)
second, or synthesis, stage of interphase during which DNA replication occurs
structure formed in a bacterial cell as a precursor to the separation of the cell into two daughter cells
stage of mitosis during which chromosomes arrive at opposite poles, decondense, and are surrounded by a new
nuclear envelope
segment of DNA that codes for regulator proteins that prevent the cell from undergoing
uncontrolled division
CHAPTER SUMMARY
10.1 Cell Division
Prokaryotes have a single circular chromosome composed of double-stranded DNA, whereas eukaryotes have multiple,
linear chromosomes composed of chromatin, all surrounded by a nuclear membrane. The 46 chromosomes of human
somatic cells are composed of 22 pairs of autosomes (matched pairs) and a pair of sex chromosomes, which may or may
not be matched. This is the 2n or diploid state. Human gametes have 23 chromosomes represe
