f a cell, which cannot be viewed by
transmission electron microscopy.
31. The major role of the cell wall in bacteria is protecting
the cell against changes in osmotic pressure, pressure
caused by different solute concentrations in the
environment. Bacterial cells swell, but do not burst, in low
solute concentrations. What happens to bacterial cells if a
compound that interferes with the synthesis of the cell wall
is added to an environment with low solute
concentrations?
a.
Bacterial cells will shrink due to the lack of cell
wall material.
b.
Bacterial cells will shrink in size.
c.
Bacterial cells may burst due to the influx of
water.
d.
Bacterial cells remain normal; they have
alternative pathways to synthesize cell walls.
32. We have discussed the upper limits of cell size; yet,
there is a lower limit to cell size. What determines how
small a cell can be?
a.
The cell should be large enough to escape
detection.
b.
The cell should be able to accommodate all the
structures and metaboli
