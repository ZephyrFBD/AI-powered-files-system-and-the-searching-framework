es are used to
generate DNA fragments that terminate at different points. The DNA is separated by capillary electrophoresis on the
basis of size, and from the order of fragments formed, the DNA sequence can be read. The DNA sequence readout is
shown on an electropherogram that is generated by a laser scanner.
The DNA sample to be sequenced is denatured or separated into two strands by heating it to high temperatures. The
DNA is divided into four tubes in which a primer, DNA polymerase, and all four nucleotides (A, T, G, and C) are added.
In addition to each of the four tubes, limited quantities of one of the four dideoxynucleotides are added to each tube

respectively. The tubes are labeled as A, T, G, and C according to the ddNTP added. For detection purposes, each of the four
dideoxynucleotides carries a different fluorescent label. Chain elongation continues until a fluorescent dideoxy nucleotide
is incorporated, after which no further elon
