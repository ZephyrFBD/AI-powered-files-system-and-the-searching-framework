the
iris through which light passes (the pupil) is black because no light is reflected
from it (itâ€™s a hole), and very little light is reflected back out from the interior of
the eye. The retina, which plays the role of the film or sensor in a camera, is on the
curved rear surface of the eye. The retina consists of a complex array of nerves
and receptors known as rods and cones which act to change light energy into elec-
trical signals that travel along the nerves. The reconstruction of the image from all
these tiny receptors is done mainly in the brain, although some analysis may also
be done in the complex interconnected nerve network at the retina itself. At the
center of the retina is a small area called the fovea, about 0.25 mm in diameter,
where the cones are very closely packed and the sharpest image and best color
discrimination are found.
Unlike a camera, the eye contains no shutter. The equivalent operation is
carried out by the nervous system, which analyzes the signals to f
