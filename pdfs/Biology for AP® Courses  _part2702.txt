cally, the amyloplasts return to their normal position. Other hypotheses—involving the entire cell in
the gravitropism effect—have been proposed to explain why some mutants that lack amyloplasts may still exhibit a weak
gravitropic response.
Growth Responses
A plant’s sensory response to external stimuli relies on chemical messengers (hormones). Plant hormones affect all aspects
of plant life, from flowering to fruit setting and maturation, and from phototropism to leaf fall. Potentially every cell in a
plant can produce plant hormones. They can act in their cell of origin or be transported to other portions of the plant body,
with many plant responses involving the synergistic or antagonistic interaction of two or more hormones. In contrast, animal
hormones are produced in specific glands and transported to a distant site for action, and they act alone.
Plant hormones are a group of unrelated chemical substances that affect plant morphogenesis. Five major plant hormones
