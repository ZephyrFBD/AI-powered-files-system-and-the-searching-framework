perm with two copies of chromosome 1.
(A)
Nondisjunction occurred during both oogenesis and
spermatogenesis. An ovum with two copies of chromosome 1
was fertilized by a sperm that lacked chromosome 1.
(B)
Nondisjunction occurred during oogenesis. An ovum with
two copies of chromosome 1 was fertilized by a normal
sperm, resulting in a diploid zygote.
(C)
Nondisjunction occurred during oogenesis. An ovum with
two copies of chromosome 1 was fertilized by a sperm with
one copy of chromosome 1, which was then extruded during
early development.

12. The dilute coat color in cats is caused by a Mendelian autosomal
recessive allele. Cats with two of these alleles have lighter fur
color compared with heterozygous cats or those lacking the allele.
A researcher crossed heterozygous cats and collected data from
their 232 oﬀspring. What is the predicted number of oﬀspring with
dilute fur?
