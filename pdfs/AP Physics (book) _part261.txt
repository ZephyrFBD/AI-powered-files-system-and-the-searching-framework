work easier. (For example, choose
one axis along the direction of one of the vectors, which
then will have only one component.)
3. Resolve each vector into its x and y components,
showing each component along its appropriate
(x or y) axis as a (dashed) arrow.
4. Calculate each component (when not given) using
sines and cosines. If 
is the angle that vector 
makes with the positive x axis, then:
V
1x = V
1 cos u1 ,  V
1y = V
1 sin u1 .

3–5 Projectile Motion
In Chapter 2, we studied the one-dimensional motion of an object in terms of dis-
placement, velocity, and acceleration, including purely vertical motion of a falling
object undergoing acceleration due to gravity. Now we examine the more general
translational motion of object
