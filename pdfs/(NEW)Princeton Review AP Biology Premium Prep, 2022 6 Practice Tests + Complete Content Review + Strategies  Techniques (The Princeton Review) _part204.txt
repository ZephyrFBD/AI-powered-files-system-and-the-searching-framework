solutions. The
equation to do this is on the AP Biology Equations and Formulas sheet.
CiVi = CfVf
This equation tells you how much (Vi) of a concentrated solution (at Ci) is required to make a more dilute solution
(Cf) of a certain volume (Vf). The amount of solvent added will be the final volume of the solution (Vf) minus
whatever amount of stock solution you need to add. For example, if you have a bottle of 2 M solution of Tris buffer
and would like to make 50 mL of 0.1 M Tris:
CiVi = CfVf
(2 M)(Vi) = (0.1 M)(0.050 L)
Vi = 0.0025 L, or 2.5 mL
Thus, you would add 2.5 mL of the concentrated (stock) Tris solution to a new tube or bottle and then add water (the
solvent) up to a final volume of 50 mL. In other words, you should add 47.5 mL of water.
Active Transport
Suppose a substance wants to move in the opposite direction—from a region of lower concentration to a region of
higher concentration. A transport protein can help usher the substance across the plasma membrane, but it’s going
