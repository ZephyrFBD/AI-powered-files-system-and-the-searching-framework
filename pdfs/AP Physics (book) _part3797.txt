(c) At the centers of stars during novae.
(d) At the centers of stars during supernovae.
(e) On the surfaces of planets as they cooled and hardened.
9. We know that there must be dark matter in the universe
because
(a) we see dark dust clouds.
(b) we see that the universe is expanding.
(c) we see that stars far from the galactic center are
moving faster than can be explained by visible matter.
(d) we see that the expansion of the universe is accelerating.
10. Acceleration of the universeâ€™s expansion rate is due to
(a) the repulsive effect of dark energy.
(b) the attractive effect of dark matter.
(c) the attractive effect of gravity.
