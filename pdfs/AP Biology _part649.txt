Thrombocytes
These are not cells; rather, they are cell fragments that are formed in the
bone marrow (from megakaryocytes) and they clot blood
Red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets all develop in bone
marrow from multipotent stem cells. These stem cells keep dividing and
constantly replenish the population of blood cells throughout a person’s
life.
The Mechanism of Blood Clotting
Blood clotting is a complex mechanism that begins with the release of
clotting factors from platelets and damaged tissue. It involves a complex
set of reactions, including the activation of inactive plasma proteins.
Anticlotting factors normally circulate in the plasma to prevent the
formation of a clot or thrombus, which can cause serious damage even in
the absence of an injury.
Here is the pathway of normal clot formation:
