(C) The structure of the loop would lead to 
elevated thyroid and tissue activity due to 
 
positive feedback. 
(D) The feedback mechanism would maintain 
relatively constant levels of thyroxin 
throughout tissue targets.

28. The Stanley Miller apparatus demonstrated that 
organic molecules could assemble spontaneously 
in an environment lacking free oxygen and 
containing water, methane, and ammonia in the 
presence of an abundant energy source, such as an 
electric discharge. The research was considered 
supportive of the organic soup hypothesis, which 
states that the primitive atmosphere provided 
inorganic precursors from which organic 
molecules could have been synthesized in the 
presence of an energy source. Based on 
subsequent research, the primordial atmosphere 
was determined to contain less methane and more 
car
