Having two oppositely oriented layers of 
phospholipids allows the hydrophilic 
heads to repel water both inside and 
outside of the cells. 
(C) Having two identically oriented layers of 
phospholipids gives cells more protection 
from the exterior environment than just a 
single layer would. 
(D) Having two identically oriented layers of 
phospholipids allows for the production 
of vacuoles while still maintaining a 
protective barrier. 
47. A student calculated the average surface 
area-to-volume ratio of four different types of 
human epithelial cells. The results are shown in 
the table below. 
Cell Type 
Surface Area-to-Volume 
Ratio 
Simple squamous 
9 
Simple cuboidal 
6 
Simple columnar 
4 
Simple spherical 
3 
Based on the data, which type of cell would be 
best suited for the lining the alveoli of the lungs, 
where diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen 
must occur very rapidly? 
(A) Simple squamous cells 
(B) Simple cuboidal cells 
(C) Simple columnar cells 
(D) Simple spher
