less equally at each age interval. These organisms also may have relatively few offspring and provide significant parental
care. Trees, marine invertebrates, and most fishes exhibit a Type III survivorship curve because very few of these organisms
survive their younger years; however, those that make it to an old age are more likely to survive for a relatively long period
of time. Organisms in this category usually have a very large number of offspring, but once they are born, little parental
care is provided. Thus these offspring are “on their own” and vulnerable to predation, but their sheer numbers assure the
survival of enough individuals to p
