ves into a
body by osmosis, hydrostatic pressure (osmotic pressure) may build up inside the body. Turgor pressure is the
hydrostatic pressure that develops when water enters the cells of plants and microorganisms.
3. Plasmolysis is the movement of water out of a cell (by osmosis) that results in the collapse of the cell (especially
plant cells with central vacuoles). In contrast, when water moves into a cell (by osmosis), the cell volume increases
and the cell expands. Cell lysis occurs when swelling causes the cell to burst (especially animal cells and other cells
that lack a cell wall).
4. Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion of solutes or water through channel proteins or carrier proteins in the plasma
membrane. Some
 
channel proteins facilitate the movement of ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, or Clâˆ’ the plasma membrane, while other
channel proteins, the
aquaporins, facilitate the movement of water across the plasma membrane. Carrier proteins can facilitate the
movement of ions, as we
