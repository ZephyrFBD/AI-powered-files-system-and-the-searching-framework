 in 
magnitude, the force of static friction 
increases in proportion until the 
applied force equals 
If the 
applied force increases further, the 
object will begin to move, and the 
friction force drops to a roughly 
constant value characteristic of kinetic 
friction.

Friction can be a hindrance. It slows down moving objects and causes heating
and binding of moving parts in machinery. Friction can be reduced by using lubri-
cants such as oil. More effective in reducing friction between two surfaces is to
maintain a layer of air or other gas between them. Devices using this concept,
which is not practical for most situations, include air tracks and air tables in which
the layer of air is maintained by forcing air through many tiny holes. Another
technique to maintain the air layer is to suspend objects in air using magnetic
fields (“magnetic levitation”).
On the other hand, friction can be helpful. Our ability to
