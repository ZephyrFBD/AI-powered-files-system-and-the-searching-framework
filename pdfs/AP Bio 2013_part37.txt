because 
(A) the apple tree was imported into North 
America with European settlement 
approximately 200 years ago 
(B) flies were imported into North America with 
European settlement approximately 
200 years ago 
(C) long-distance rail transport of fruit increased 
only after the American Civil War  
(1861–1865) 
(D) heavy use of gunpowder during the  
American Civil War (1861–1865) led to 
increased mutation rates in many natural 
populations of plants and animals 
 
 
21. Initially, which of the following isolating 
mechanisms is likely to have been the most 
important in preventing gene flow between  
the two populations of Rhagoletis? 
(A) Gamete incompatibility 
(B) Temporal isolation 
(C) Mechanical isolation 
(D) Reduced hybrid viability 
 
22. Matings between individuals from the  
two populations of Rhagoletis produce hybrid 
flies that appear to be healthy and have normal 
life spans. The eggs laid by these hybrid flies, 
however, hatch less often than those of flie
