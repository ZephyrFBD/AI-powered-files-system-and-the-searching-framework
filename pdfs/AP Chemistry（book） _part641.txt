ectrolytes; that is, as separated 
ions in solution. Which statement is most correct about 
this process? (a) Water is a strong acid and therefore is good 
at dissolving ionic solids. (b) Water is good at solvating ions 
because the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water molecules 
bear partial charges. (c) The hydrogen and oxygen bonds of 
water are easily broken by ionic solids.
 4.16 Would you expect that an anion would be physically closer 
to the oxygen or to the hydrogens of water molecules that 
surround it in solution?
 4.17 Specify what ions are present in solution upon dissolv-
ing each of the following substances in water: (a) FeCl2,  
(b) HNO3, (c) 1NH422SO4, (d) Ca1OH22.
 4.18 Specify what ions are present upon dissolving each of the 
following substances in water: (a) MgI2, (b) K2CO3, (c) 
HClO4, (d) NaCH3COO.
 
4.3 Use the molecular representations shown here to classify 
each compound as a nonelectrolyte, a weak electrolyte, 
or a strong electrolyte (see Figure 4.6 for the
