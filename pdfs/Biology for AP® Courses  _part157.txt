 the elements in the tableâ€™s far
right column in the periodic table. The group 18 atoms helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar) all have filled outer electron
shells, making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability; they are highly stable as single
atoms. Their non-reactivity has resulted in their being named the inert gases (or noble gases). Compare this to the group
1 elements in the left-hand column. These elements, including hydrogen (H), lithium (Li), and sodium (Na), all have one
electron in their outermost shells. That means that they can achieve a stable configuration and a filled outer shell by donating
or sharing one electron with another atom or a molecule such as water. Hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve
this configuration, while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable. As a result of losing a negatively
charged electron, they become positively charged ions. Group 17 elements, including fluorine
