s and the intake valve opens, and the whole cycle repeats.

Why a 
Is Needed to Drive a Heat Engine
To see why a temperature difference is required to run an engine, consider a steam
engine. In the reciprocating engine, for example, suppose there were no con-
denser or pump (Fig. 15â€“12a), and that the steam was at the same temperature
throughout the system. Then the pressure of the gas being exhausted would be
the same as on intake. The work done by the gas on the piston when it expanded
would equal the amount of work done by the piston to force the steam out the
exhaust; hence, no net work would be done. In a real engine, the exhausted gas is
cooled to a lower temperature and condensed so that the exhaust pressure is less
than the intake pressure. Thus, the work the piston must do on the gas to expel it
on the exhaust stroke is less than the work done by the gas on the piston during
the intake. So a net amount of work can be obt
