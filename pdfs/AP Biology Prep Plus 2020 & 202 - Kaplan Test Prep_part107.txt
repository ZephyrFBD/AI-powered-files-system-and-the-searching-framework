The RNA world hypothesis, because ribozymes provide
evidence that RNA could replicate, store genetic information,
and catalyze chemical reactions without DNA

The volcanic origin of life model, because the extreme
temperature conditions coupled with the volcanic gas
formed the precursors for amino acids, which ribozymes
used as building blocks to self-replicate
