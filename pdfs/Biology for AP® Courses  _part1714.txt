 happen if the 5’ methyl guanosine was not
added to an mRNA?
a.
The transcript would degrade when the mRNA
moves out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
b.
The mRNA molecule would stabilize and start
the process of translation within the nucleus of
the cell.
c.
The mRNA molecule would move out of the
nucleus and create more copies of the mRNA
molecule.
d.
The mRNA molecule would not be able to add
the poly-A tail on its strand at the 5’ end.
39. Transcribe and translate the following DNA sequence
(nontemplate strand): 5’-ATGGCCGGTTATTAAGCA-3’
a.
The mRNA would be 5’-
AUGGCCGGUUAUUAAGCA-3’ and the
protein will be MAGY.
b.
The mRNA would be 3’-
AUGGCCGGUUAUUAAGCA-5’ and the
protein will be MAGY.
c.
The mRNA would be 5’-
ATGGCCGGTTATTAAGCA-3’ and the protein
will be MAGY.
d.
The mRNA would be 5’-
AUGGCCGGUUAUUAAGCA-3’ and the
protein will be MACY.
40. The RNA world hypothesis proposes that the first
complex molecule was RNA and it preceded protein
formation. Which major function of the ribos
