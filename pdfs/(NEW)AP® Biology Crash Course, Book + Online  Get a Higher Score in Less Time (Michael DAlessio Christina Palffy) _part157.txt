Ultimately, neither species benefits from this interaction.
IV.
Succession
A. Succession—the gradual progression of different communities over time that occurs on virgin territory or
in a habitat recovering from natural or manmade disturbances and involves species changing the
environment over time.
B. Primary Succession—begins slowly and takes longer than secondary succession (hundreds to thousands
of years) because it occurs in areas that have not recently supported life.
1. An area involved in primary succession may be newly exposed or newly formed rock, such as rock
exposed by a glacier receding or islands produced by volcanic action.
2. Autotrophic bacteria, algae, and lichens that grow on rocks are common pioneer species—the first
species to colonize the area. Soil eventually will be produced to support plants and insects, and more
gradually, larger animals and plants will migrate to the area and form a community.
C. Secondary Succession—occurs in areas where soil still remains a
