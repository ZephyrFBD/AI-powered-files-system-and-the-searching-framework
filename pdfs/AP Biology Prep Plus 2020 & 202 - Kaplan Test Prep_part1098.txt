migratorius) was the most abundant bird in North America. Over the next

28. In healthy human skin cells, cyclin-dependent kinases or CDKs are
enzymes that actively regulate the cell cycle from interphase through
mitosis as shown in Figure 1. When the cells are exposed to a carcinogen
such as nicotine, the cells’ DNA may become damaged. CDKs’ activity is
then blocked as shown in Figure 2.
