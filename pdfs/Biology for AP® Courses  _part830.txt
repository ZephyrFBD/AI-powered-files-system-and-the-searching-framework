of the membrane.
If the membrane were open to diffusion by the hydrogen ions, the ions would tend to diffuse back across into the matrix,
driven by their electrochemical gradient. Recall that many ions cannot diffuse through the nonpolar regions of phospholipid
membranes without the aid of ion channels. Similarly, hydrogen ions in the matrix space can only pass through the inner
mitochondrial membrane through an integral membrane protein called ATP synthase (Figure 7.12). This complex protein
acts as a tiny generator, turned by the force of the hydrogen ions diffusing through it, down their electrochemical gradient.
The turning of parts of this molecular machine facilitates the addition of a phosphate to ADP, forming ATP, using the
potential energy of the hydrogen ion gradient.
