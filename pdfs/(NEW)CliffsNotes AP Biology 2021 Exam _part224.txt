re is only half the number of chromosomes.
8. In telophase II (restoration), the nuclear envelope reappears at each pole and cytokinesis occurs. The end result
of meiosis is four haploid cells (chromosome makeup of each daughter cell designated by n). Each cell contains half
the number of chromosomes, and each chromosome consists of only one chromatid.

Mitosis versus Meiosis
Comparing mitosis and meiosis ( Table 7-1), you will find that mitosis ends with two diploid daughter cells, each
with a complete set of chromosomes. True, each chromosome is composed of only one chromatid, but the second
chromatid is regenerated during the S phase of interphase. Mitosis, then, merely duplicates cells; the two daughter
cells are essentially clones of the original cell. As such, mitosis occurs during growth and development of
multicellular organisms and for repair (replacement) of existing cells. Mitosis is also responsible for asexual
reproduction, common among plants and single-celled e
