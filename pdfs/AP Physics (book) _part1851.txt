p (here,
a portion of the Sierra Nevada in California) 
shows continuous contour lines, each of which 
is at a fixed height above sea level. Here they 
are at 80-ft (25-m) intervals. If you walk along 
one contour line, you neither climb nor 
descend. If you cross lines, and especially if you 
climb perpendicular to the lines, you will be 
changing your gravitational potential (rapidly,
if the lines are close together).
17â€“4 The Electron Volt, a Unit of Energy
The joule is a very large unit for dealing with energies of electrons, atoms, or molecules.
For this purpose, the unit electron volt (eV) is used. One electron volt is defined as
the energy acquired by a particle carrying a charge whose magnitude equals that
on the electron 
as a result of moving through a potential difference of 1 V.
The charge on an electron has magnitude 
and the change in potential
energy equals qV. So 1 eV is equal to  
An electron that accelerates through a potential difference of 1000 V will lose 1000 eV
