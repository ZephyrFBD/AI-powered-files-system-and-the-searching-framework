If we reduced the flow of electrons (or photons) so they passed through the
slits one at a time, we would see a flash each time one struck the screen. At first,
the flashes would seem random. Indeed, there is no way to predict just where any
one electron would hit the screen. If we let the experiment run for a long time,
and kept track of where each electron hit the screen, we would soon see a pattern
emerging—the interference pattern predicted by the wave theory; see Fig. 28–4.
Thus, although we could not predict where a given electron would strike the
screen, we could predict probabilities. (The same can be said for photons.) The
probability, as we saw, is proportional to 
Where 
is zero, we would get a
minimum in the interference pattern. And where 
is a maximum, we would get
a peak in the interference pattern.
The interference pattern would thus occur even when electrons (or photons)
passed through
