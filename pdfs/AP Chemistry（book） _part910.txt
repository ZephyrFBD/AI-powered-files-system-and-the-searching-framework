True or False: There is an upper limit on the energy of a photon that can be emitted 
from a hydrogen atom.
 
Sample Exercise 6.4 
Electronic Transitions in the Hydrogen Atom
In the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, electrons are confined to orbits with fixed radii, and those radii can be calculated.  
The radii of the first four orbits are 0.53, 2.12, 4.76, and 8.46 Å, respectively, as depicted below.
