According to the United Nations, 95% of the world’s cities still dump raw sewage into 
their water supplies. Thus, it should come as no surprise that 80% of all the health mala-
dies in developing countries can be traced to waterborne diseases associated with unsan-
itary water.
One promising development is a device called the LifeStraw (Figure 18.22). 
When a person sucks water through the straw, the water first encounters a tex-
tile filter with a mesh opening of 100 μm followed by a second textile filter with a 
mesh opening of 15 μm. These filters remove debris and even clusters of bacteria. 
The water next encounters a chamber of iodine-impregnated beads, where bacteria, 
viruses, and parasites are killed. Finally, the water passes through granulated active 
carbon, which removes the smell of iodine as well as the parasites that have not been 
taken by the filters or killed by the iodine. At present the Lifestraw is too costly to 
permit widespread use in underdeveloped countries
