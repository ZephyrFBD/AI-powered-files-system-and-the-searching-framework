known as a micelle, where the hydrophilic phosphate heads face the outside and the fatty
acids face the interior of this structure.
Fats are amphiphilic molecules. In other words, the long hydrocarbon tail is hydrophobic, and the glycerol
part of the molecule is hydrophilic. When in water, fats will arrange themselves into a ball called a micelle
so that the hydrophilic “heads” are on the outer surface, and the hydrophobic “tails” are on the inside where
they are protected from the surrounding water.

Steroids
Unlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier, steroids have a fused ring structure. Although they do not resemble the
other lipids, they are grouped with them because they are also hydrophobic and insoluble in water. All steroids have four
linked carbon rings and several of them, like cholesterol, have a short tail (Figure 3.23). Many steroids also have the –OH
functional group, which puts them in the alcohol classification (sterols).
