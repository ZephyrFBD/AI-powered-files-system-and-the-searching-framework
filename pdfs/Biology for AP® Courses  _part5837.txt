own that the virus actually causes a disease. This
demonstrates infectivity and transmission of an infectious agent.
None of these steps has even been aĴempted with the SARS-CoV-2
virus, nor have all these steps been successfully performed for any
so-called pathogenic virus. Our research indicates that a single study
showing these steps does not exist in the medical literature.
Instead, since 1954, virologists have taken unpuriﬁed samples
from a relatively few people, oĞen less than ten, with a similar
disease. They then minimally process this sample and inoculate this
unpuriﬁed sample onto tissue culture containing usually four to six
other types of material – all of which contain identical genetic
material as to what is called a “virus.” The tissue culture is starved
and poisoned and naturally disintegrates into many types of
particles, some of which contain genetic material. Against all
common sense, logic, use of the English language and scientiﬁc
integrity, this process is called
