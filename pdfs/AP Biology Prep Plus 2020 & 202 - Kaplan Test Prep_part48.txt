acids like oleic acid (the primary fatty acid in olive
oil) have one double bond and polyunsaturated fatty acids like linoleic
acid have two or more double bonds.
The configuration of the double bonds aﬀects the behavior of fatty acids
(and the fats that contain them). In the cis configuration, hydrogen atoms
at a double bond are in the same plane (on the same side), and in the
trans configuration, they are in two diﬀerent planes (on opposite sides).
Unlike single bonds, which allow atoms to rotate freely, double bonds
restrict rotation and lock the orientation of atoms. A cis double bond
causes a bend in the chain, which prevents fatty acids from packing
tightly against one another, so they are liquid at room temperature and
have a relatively low melting point. Saturated fatty acids on the other
hand pack tightly together, so they are solid at room temperature and
have a relatively high melting point.
Fats called triglycerides are another subgroup of lipids. Triglycerides are
formed v
