Is the result of the combined effects of solute concentration and
pressure
Water potential=pressure potential+solute potentialΨ=Ψp+Ψs
Water moves from high water potential to low water potential
Water potential (Ψ) is a physical property that predicts the direction in
which water will flow. Water flows from a region of high water potential

to low water potential. Think of Ψ as water’s potential energy. It is a
powerful force and is measured in megapascals (MPa). One MPa equals
approximately 10× atmospheric pressure. By definition, the Ψ of water in
an open container under standard conditions of temperature and pressure
(at sea level and at room temperature) is 0 MPa.
Water potential (Ψ) results from the interaction of two components:
solute potential (Ψs) and pressure potential (Ψp).
Ψ=Ψs+Ψp
The solute potential (Ψs), also known as osmotic potential, of a
solution is directly proportional to its molarity. By definition, the Ψs of
