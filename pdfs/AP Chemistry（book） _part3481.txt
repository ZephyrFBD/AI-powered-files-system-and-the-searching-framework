occurring nonradioactive chlorine 
atoms, how many disintegrations per second are produced 
by this sample? The half-life of chlorine-36 is 3.0 * 105 yr.
 21.88  Calculate the mass of octane, C8H181l2, that must be 
burned in air to evolve the same quantity of energy as pro-
duced by the fusion of 1.0 g of hydrogen in the following 
fusion reaction:

Assume that all the products of the combustion of octane 
are in their gas phases. Use data from Exercise 21.50, Ap-
pendix C, and the inside covers of the text. The standard 
enthalpy of formation of octane is -250.1 kJ>mol.
 21.89  Naturally found uranium consists of 99.274% 238U, 
0.720% 235U, and 0.006% 233U. As we have seen, 235U is the 
isotope that can undergo a nuclear chain reaction. Most of 
the 235U used in the first atomic bomb was obtained by gas-
eous diffusion of uranium hexafluoride, UF61g2. (a) What is 
the mass of UF6 in a 30.0-L vessel of UF6 at a pressure of 695 
torr at 350 K? (b) What is the m
