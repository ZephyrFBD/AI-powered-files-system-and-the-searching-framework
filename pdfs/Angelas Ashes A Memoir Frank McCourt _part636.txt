 spoons of tea and sugar and a few 
 
 cuts of bread to keep me going. I’ll learn to cycle on Laman Griffin’s 
 
 bicycle every night after he goes to bed and he’ll surely let me borrow 
 
 it for the two days in Killaloe. 
 
 The best time to ask him for anything is Friday night when he’s in 
 
  
  
 a good mood after his night of drinking and his dinner. He brings 
 
 home the same dinner in his overcoat pockets, a big steak dripping 
 
 blood, four potatoes, an onion, a bottle of stout. Mam boils the potatoes 
 
 and fries the steak with sliced onion. He keeps his overcoat on, sits 
 
 at the table and eats the steak out of his hands.The grease and blood 
 
 roll down his chin and on to the overcoat where he wipes his hands. 
 
 He drinks his stout and laughs that there’s nothing like a great bloody 
 
 steak of a Friday night and if that’s the worst sin he ever commits he’ll 
 
 float to heaven body and soul, ha ha ha. 
 
 Of course you can have my bike, he says.Boy should be able
