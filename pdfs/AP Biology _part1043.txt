t get transcribed
and translated into polypeptides. Genes consist of more than
one exon. Introns are intervening sequences of DNA, and they
do not code for proteins. They must be spliced out of the pre-
RNA transcript before the pre-RNA moves to ribosomes in the
cytoplasm. Some introns regulate the expression of exons.
The figure illustrates how different proteins can be created by
transcribing the same set of exons in a different order. This
process, known as alternative splicing of DNA, is so effective
that only 3% of human DNA is needed to code for proteins. In
addition, although much of our DNA gets transcribed, it does
not get translated into proteins. This transcribed (but not
translated) DNA has many important functions in a cell. For
example, some of it forms spliceosomes to splice introns out of
pre-RNA. The rest of it probably consists of regulatory
sequences that control the transcription of other parts of DNA.
Cell Type A has mitochondria, lots of ribosomes, no cilia, and
