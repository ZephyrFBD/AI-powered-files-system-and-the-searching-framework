eakers are in phase? (b) Calculate
two other frequencies that also result in destructive interference
at this point (give the next two highest). Let
54. (III) Two loudspeakers are placed 3.00 m apart, as shown in
Fig. 12–37. They emit 474-Hz sounds, in phase. A micro-
phone is placed 3.20 m distant from a point midway between
the two speakers, where an intensity maximum is recorded.
(a) How far must the microphone be moved to the right 
to find the first intensity
minimum? (b) Suppose the
speakers are reconnected so
that the 474-Hz sounds they
emit are exactly out of
phase. At what positions are
the intensity maximum and
minimum now?
T = 20°C.

1580 Hz is traveling at 
(a) What frequencies
does an observer standing next to the road hear as the car
approaches and as it recedes? (b) What frequencies are
heard in a car traveling at 
in the opposite 
direction before and after passing the police car? (c) The
police car passes a car
