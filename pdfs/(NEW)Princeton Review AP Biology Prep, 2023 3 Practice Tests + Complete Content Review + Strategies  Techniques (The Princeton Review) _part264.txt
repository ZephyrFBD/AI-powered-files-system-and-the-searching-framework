ler two-component regulatory system in transduction pathways.
Signal transduction cascades are helpful to amplify a signal. They are also helpful in quickly turning a response on
or off and can lead to important changes in gene expression and cell function.
Signal transduction pathways influence how cells respond to their environments. Pathways may cause changes to
gene expression and cell function, which may change a cell’s phenotype or cause apoptosis. Mutations in the
receptor or the ligand can alter signaling. Drugs and chemicals that inhibit or excite part of the pathway can also
influence the gene expression within the cell.
FEEDBACK
All living things have a “steady state” that they try to maintain. This is helpful because the structures and processes
within living things are sensitive to things like temperature, pH, pressure, salinity, osmotic pressure, and many other
things. The set of conditions under which living things can successfully survive is called homeostasis. The body
