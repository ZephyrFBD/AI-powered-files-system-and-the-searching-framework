roduced in the glycolytic pathway (glycolysis), the Krebs cycle, and by oxidative phosphorylation.
5. A. Arrow 3 represents the NADH produced in glycolysis (Pathway A) and is used in oxidative phosphorylation
(Pathway C). In addition, NADH could also be represented by arrow 7, a product of the Krebs
cycle (Pathway B). Arrow 7 could also represent FADH2, but FADH2
 
cannot be represented by arrow 3. Thus, only NADH can be represented by both arrows 3 and 7. If arrow 7
represents NADH, then arrow 6
 
represents FADH2.
 
6. A. Arrow 9 could represent the O2 that accepts the electrons after they
 
pass through the electron transport chain in oxidative phosphorylation. Arrow 9 could also be ADP, but ADP is not
among the answer choices. 7. C. Pathway B represents the Krebs cycle. The Krebs cycle uses the
 
energy in pyruvate (arrow 2) to generate FADH2 and NADH (arrows 6
and 7).
8. B. These molecules each have the potential to produce the following amounts of ATP: glucose, 36 ATP; pyruvate,
