 and C. For
smaller R compared to 
and 
the resonance peak will be higher and sharper.
When R is very small, we speak of an LC circuit. The energy in an LC circuit
oscillates, at frequency 
between the inductor and the capacitor, with some being
dissipated in R (some resistance is unavoidable). This is called an LC oscillation
or an electromagnetic oscillation. Not only does the charge oscillate back and forth,
but so does the energy, which oscillates between being stored in the electric field
of the capacitor and in the magnetic field of the inductor.
Electric resonance is used in many circuits. Radio and TV sets, for example,
use resonant circuits for tuning in a station. Many frequencies reach the circuit
from the antenna, but a significant current flows only for frequencies at or near
the resonant frequency chosen (the station you want). Either L or C is variable
so that different stations can be tuned in (more on this in Chapter 22).
