nsity between the 
two atoms—a node. Notice the similarity between this figure 
and Figure 9.32. In Figure 9.40, we use red and blue shading to 
denote positive and negative phases in the H atomic orbitals. 
other d orbitals likewise have lobes in which the phase in one lobe is 
opposite that in an adjacent lobe.
Why do we need to consider the complexity introduced by 
considering the phase of the wave function? While it is true that 
the phase is not necessary to visualize the shape of an atomic or-
bital in an isolated atom, it does become important when we con-
sider overlap of orbitals in molecular orbital theory. Let’s use the 
sine function as an example again. If you add two sine functions 
having the same phase, they add constructively, resulting in in-
creased amplitude:
