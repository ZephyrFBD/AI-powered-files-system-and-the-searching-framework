THMs.
Some THMs and other halogenated organic substances are suspected carcinogens; 
others interfere with the body’s endocrine system. As a result, the World Health Organi-
zation and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have placed concentration limits 
of 80 mg>L (80 ppb) on the total quantity of THMs in drinking water. The goal is to reduce 
the levels of THMs and other disinfection by-products in the drinking water supply while 
preserving the antibacterial effectiveness of the water treatment. In some cases, lower-
ing the concentration of chlorine may provide adequate disinfection while reducing the 
concentrations of THMs formed. Alternative oxidizing agents, such as ozone or chlorine 
dioxide, produce less of the halogenated substances but have their own disadvantages. 
For example, each is capable of oxidizing dissolved bromide, as shown here for ozone:
 
O31aq2 + Br-1aq2 + H2O1l2 ¡ HBrO1aq2 + O21aq2 + OH-1aq2 
[18.17]
 
   HBrO1aq2 + 2 O31aq2 ¡ BrO3
-1aq2 + 2 O21aq2 +
