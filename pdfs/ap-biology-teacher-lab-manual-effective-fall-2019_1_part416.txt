llow the temperature in the microrespirometers to equalize. 
Step 3 Use a dropping pipette to add one small drop of manometer fluid to the tip of each 
capillary tube. If everything is working properly, the drop will be sucked down into the 
capillary tube. The manometer fluid will seal the chamber of the microrespirometers. 
(You should use the plunger on the control microrespirometers to get the manometer 
fluid into the capillary. Pull on the plunger until the manometer drop is about halfway 
down the capillary. See Figure 5.)

Step 4 As oxygen is consumed by cellular respiration, the manometer fluid plug will move 
toward the chamber. Record the starting position of each plug by marking its position on 
the capillary with a marker. Be sure to mark the bottom edge of the plug. These are your 
Time 0 marks. Begin timing once you have made the Time 0 marks.
