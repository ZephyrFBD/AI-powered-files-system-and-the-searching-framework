 object by adding the different vector forces acting on it. It might
be useful now to review Sections 3–2, 3–3, and 3–4. Here is a brief review of vectors.
Vector Addition Review
Suppose two vector forces,
and 
act on an object (Fig. 16–18a). They can be
added using the tail-to-tip method (Fig. 16–18b) or by the parallelogram method
(Fig. 16–18c), as discussed in Section 3–2. These two methods are useful for
understanding a given problem (for getting a picture in your mind of what is
going on). But for calculating the direction and magnitude of the resultant sum, it
is more precise to use the method of adding components. Figure 16–18d shows
the forces 
and 
resolved into components along chosen x and y axes (for
more details, see Section 3–4). From the definitions of the trigonometric functions
(Figs. 3–11 and 3–12), we have
We add up the x and y components separately to obtain the components of the
resultant force 
which are
The magnitude of the resultant (or net) force 
is
