s other structures in the cell follow (Figure 3-2):
1. The nucleus is bounded by the nuclear envelope consisting of two phospholipid bilayers, each similar to the
plasma membrane. The nucleus contains DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the hereditary information of the cell.
Normally, the DNA is spread out within the nucleus as a thread-like matrix called chromatin. When the cell begins
to divide, the chromatin condenses into rod-shaped bodies called chromosomes, each of which, before dividing, is
made up of two long DNA molecules and various histone (protein) molecules. The histones serve to organize the
lengthy DNA, coiling it into bundles called nucleosomes. Also visible within the nucleus are one or more nucleoli,
concentrations of DNA in the process of manufacturing the components of ribosomes. The nucleus also serves as
the site for the separation of chromosomes during cell division. On the surface of the nuclear envelope are nuclear
pores, which serve as passageways for proteins and R
