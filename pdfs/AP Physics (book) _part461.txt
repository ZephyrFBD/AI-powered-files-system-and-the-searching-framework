the velocity changes. At each point,
the instantaneous velocity is in a 
direction tangent to the circular 
path.

(5;1)
[Equation 5–1 is valid at any instant in circular motion, and even when v is not
constant.]
To summarize, an object moving in a circle of radius r at constant speed v has
an acceleration whose direction is toward the center of the circle and whose magni-
tude is 
It is not surprising that this acceleration depends on v and r.
The greater the speed v, the faster the velocity changes direction; and the larger the
radius, the less rapidly the velocity changes direction.
The acceleration vector points toward the center of the circle when v is con-
stant. But the velocity vector always points in the direction of motion, which is
tangential to the circle. Thus the velocity and acceleration vectors are perpen-
dicular to each other at every point
