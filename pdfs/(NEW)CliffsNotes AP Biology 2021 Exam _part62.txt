es:
The substrate is the substance or substances upon which the enzyme acts. For example, the enzyme amylase
catalyzes the breakdown of the substrate amylose (starch).
Enzymes are substrate specific. The enzyme amylase, for example, catalyzes the reaction that breaks the α-
glycosidic linkage in starch but cannot break the β-glycosidic linkage in cellulose.
An enzyme is unchanged as a result of a reaction. It can perform its enzymatic function repeatedly.
An enzyme catalyzes a reaction in both forward and reverse directions. The direction of net activity is determined
by substrate concentrations and other factors. The net direction of an enzyme reaction can be driven in the forward
direction by keeping the product concentration low (by its removal, or conversion to another product).
The efficiency of an enzyme is affected by temperature and pH. The human body, for example, is maintained at a
temperature of 98.6°F, near the optimal temperature for most human enzymes. Above 104°F, these
