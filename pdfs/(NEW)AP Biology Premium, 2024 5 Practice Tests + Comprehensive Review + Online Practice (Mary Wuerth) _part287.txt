 provide reasoning to support the studentâ€™s claim.
(d) The experiment is repeated with increased exposure to UV light (for the cells that were exposed to UV
light). Predict how this change will affect the recombination frequencies. Justify your prediction.
Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (D) Meiosis produces four genetically different haploid cells. Choice (A) is incorrect because it describes the
products of mitosis. Choice (B) is incorrect because meiosis produces four cells, not two cells, and those four
cells are haploid, not diploid. Choice (C) is incorrect because meiosis produces genetically different cells, not
genetically identical cells.
2. (B) Somatic (body) cells have the diploid number of chromosomes (which is 28, based on the question), and
gametes have the haploid number of chromosomes (which, in this case, is 14). Choice (A) is incorrect because it
assigns the haploid number of chromosomes to the somatic cells and the diploid number of chromosomes to the
gametic
