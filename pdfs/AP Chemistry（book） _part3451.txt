Nuclear fusion requires high temperatures because nuclei must 
have large kinetic energies to overcome their mutual repulsions. Fu-
sion reactions are therefore called thermonuclear reactions. It is not 
yet possible to generate power on Earth through a controlled fusion 
process.

Ionizing radiation is energetic enough to remove an electron from a 
water molecule; radiation with less energy is called nonionizing radi-
ation. Ionizing radiation generates free radicals, reactive substances 
with one or more unpaired electrons. The effects of long-term ex-
posure to low levels of radiation are not completely understood, but 
there is evidence that the extent of biological damage varies in direct 
proportion to the level of exposure.
The amount of energy deposited in biological tissue by radia-
tion is called the radiation dose and is measured in units of gray or 
rad. One gray (Gy) corresponds to a dose of 1
