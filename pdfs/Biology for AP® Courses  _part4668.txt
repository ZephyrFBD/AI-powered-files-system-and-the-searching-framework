d, the ammonium is converted to nitrites (NO2−) by nitrifying
bacteria, such as Nitrosomonas, through nitrification. Subsequently, nitrites are converted to nitrates (NO3−) by similar
organisms. Third, the process of denitrification occurs, whereby bacteria, such as Pseudomonas and Clostridium, convert
the nitrates into nitrogen gas, allowing it to re-enter the atmosphere.

Figure 37.18 Nitrogen enters the living world from the atmosphere via nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This nitrogen and
nitrogenous waste from animals is then processed back into gaseous nitrogen by soil bacteria, which also supply
terrestrial food webs with the organic nitrogen they need. (credit: modification of work by John M. Evans and
