Thus, they regulate hormone production by other glands.
There are several additional hormones (and their actions) that the AP exam requires that you know. A discussion of
these follows (two more hormones, estrogen and testosterone, are discussed in Chapter 14, “Animal Reproduction
and Development”):
1. Insulin and glucagon regulate blood glucose concentration in the blood. The hormones illustrate how the
endocrine system maintains homeostasis by the action of antagonistic hormones and negative feedback. The
hormones are produced in alpha (α) cells and beta (β) cells in the islets of Langerhans. These cells are distributed
in bundles among the digestive-enzyme producing cells of the pancreas.
Beta cells secrete insulin. When the concentration of blood glucose rises (after eating, for example), beta cells
secrete insulin into the blood. Insulin stimulates the liver and most other body cells to absorb glucose. Liver and
muscle cells convert the glucose to glycogen (for storage), and adipo
