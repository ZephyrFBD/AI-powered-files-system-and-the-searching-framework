INTRODUCTION
ll organisms on Earth are believed to have descended from a
common ancestral cell about three and a half billion years ago.
According to the theory of endosymbiosis, eukaryotic cells emerged
when mitochondria and chloroplasts, once free-living prokaryotes, took up
permanent residence inside other larger cells, about one and a half billion
years ago. Here was the advent of the radically more complex eukaryotic
cell with internal membranes that compartmentalized the cell and led to
