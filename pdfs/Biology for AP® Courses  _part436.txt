Mitochondria
Mitochondria (singular = mitochondrion) are often called the “powerhouses” or “energy factories” of a cell because they
are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell’s main energy-carrying molecule. ATP represents the
short-term stored energy of the cell. Cellular respiration is the process of making ATP using the chemical energy found in
glucose and other nutrients. In mitochondria, this process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. In
fact, the carbon dioxide that you exhale with every breath comes from the cellular reactions that produce carbon dioxide as
a byproduct.
In keeping with our theme of form following function, it is important to point out that muscle cells have a very high
concentration of mitochondria that produce ATP. Your muscle cells need a lot of energy to keep yo
