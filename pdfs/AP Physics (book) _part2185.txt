between two parallel plates (Fig. 17–1).

20–2 Electric Currents Produce
Magnetic Fields
During the eighteenth century, many scientists sought to find a connection between
electricity and magnetism. A stationary electric charge and a magnet were shown to
have no influence on each other. But in 1820, Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851)
found that when a compass is placed near a wire, the compass needle deflects if
(and only if) the wire carries an electric current. As we have seen, a compass
needle is deflected by a magnetic field. So Oersted’s experiment showed that 
an electric current produces a magnetic field. He had found a connection between
electricity and magnetism.
A compass needle placed near a straight section of current-carrying wire expe-
riences a force, causing the needle t
