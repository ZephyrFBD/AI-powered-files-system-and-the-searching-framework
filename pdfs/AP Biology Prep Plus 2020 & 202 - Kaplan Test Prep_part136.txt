ane-enclosed sacs, usually
located in the cell between the ER and the plasma membrane (see the
figure under the Eukaryotes heading above). The stacks closest to the ER
are called the cis Golgi and the stacks farthest from the ER, closer to the
plasma membrane, are called the trans Golgi. Vesicles containing newly
synthesized proteins bud oﬀ of the ER and fuse with the cis Golgi. In the
Golgi, these proteins are modified and then repackaged for delivery to
other destinations in the cell. For example, the Golgi carries out post-
translational modification of proteins through glycosylation, the process
of adding sugar groups to the proteins to form glycoproteins. Many
proteins destined for the plasma membrane have carbohydrate groups
added to the surface of the protein facing the exterior of the cell.
Aȇer processing in the cis Golgi, proteins are packaged in vesicles that
move to the next layer in the stack, where they fuse and release their
contents. Proteins proceed in this manner from
