for predicting the motion of heav-
enly bodies (Sun, Moon, planets). But Copernicus’s theory had consequences
that Ptolemy’s did not, such as predicting the moonlike phases of Venus. A
simpler and richer theory, one which unifies and explains a greater variety of
phenomena, is more useful and beautiful to a scientist. And this aspect, as well
as quantitative agreement, plays a major role in the acceptance of a theory.

FIGURE 1;2 (a) Ptolemy’s geocentric view of the universe. Note at the center the four elements of the 
ancients: Earth, water, air (clouds around the Earth), and fire; then the circles, with symbols, for the Moon,
Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the fixed stars, and the signs of the zodiac. (b) An early 
representation of Copernicus’s heliocentric view of the universe with the Sun at the center. (See Chapter 5.)
An important aspect of any theory is how well it can quantitatively predict
phenomena, and from this point
