occurring in a voltaic cell. The half-cells can 
be separated by either a porous glass disc 
(as in Figure 20.4) or by a salt bridge (as in 
Figure 20.5).
The oxidation–reduction reaction
Cr2O7
2-1aq2 + 14 H+1aq2 + 6 I-1aq2 ¡ 2 Cr3+1aq2 + 3 I21s2 + 7 H2O1l2
is spontaneous. A solution containing K2Cr2O7 and H2SO4 is poured into one beaker, and a solution of KI is poured into another. 
A salt bridge is used to join the beakers. A metallic conductor that will not react with either solution (such as platinum foil) is 
suspended in each solution, and the two conductors are connected with wires through a voltmeter or some other device to detect 
an electric current. The resulting voltaic cell generates an electric current. Indicate the reaction occurring at the anode, the 
reaction at the cathode, the direct
