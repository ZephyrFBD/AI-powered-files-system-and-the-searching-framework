 each orbit would have a definite energy and would move in the
orbit without radiating energy (even though this violated classical ideas since
accelerating electric charges are supposed to emit EM waves; see Chapter 22).
He thus called the possible orbits stationary states. In this Bohr model, light is
emitted only when an electron jumps from a higher (upper) stationary state to
another of lower energy, Fig. 27–26. When such a transition occurs, a single pho-
ton of light is emitted whose energy, by energy conservation, is given by
(27;10)
where 
refers to the energy of the upper state and 
the energy of the lower
state.
In 1912–13, Bohr set out to determine what energies these orbits would have
in the simplest atom, hydrogen; the spectrum of light emitted could then be pre-
dicted from Eq. 27–10. In the Balmer formula he had the key he was looking for.
Bohr quickly found that his theory would agree with the Balmer formula if 
he assumed that the electron’s angular momentum L is quanti
