mitosis. Choice A is not the most relevant scientific
question because its content relates to meiosis, not the cell cycle.
Choice B is not the most relevant scientific question because
microtubules, not microfilaments, make up spindle fibers. If the
question had used the term microtubules, this would have been a
relevant scientific question. Choice C is not the most relevant
scientific question because ribosomes do not have anything to do
with the cell cycle. (IST-1 & SYI-1)
(C) Two important factors limit cell size and promote cell division:
the ratio of the volume of a cell to the surface area and the capacity
of the nucleus. (ENE-3)
(C) The cell is in prophase, not interphase, because chromosomes
have condensed and are visible as discrete structures. During this
time, 
condensed 
chromosomes 
pair 
up 
and 
homologous
chromosomes exchange DNA. That is the event during meiosis that
shuffles genes. During interphase, chromosomes are threadlike and
invisible under a light microscope. C
