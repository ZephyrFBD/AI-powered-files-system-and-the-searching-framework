4.1 The student is able to explain the connection between the sequence and the
subcomponents of a biological polymer and its properties.
The Science Practice Challenge Questions contain additional test questions for this section that will help you prepare for
the AP exam. These questions address the following standards:
[APLO 3.2][APLO 3.28][APLO 1.11][APLO 1.16][APLO 3.1][APLO 4.1]
Modern understandings of DNA have evolved from the discovery of nucleic acid to the development of the double-helix
model. In the 1860s, Friedrich Miescher (Figure 14.2), a physician by profession, was the first person to isolate phosphate-
rich chemicals from white blood cells or leukocytes. He named these chemicals (which would eventually be known as RNA
and DNA) nuclein because they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells.
Figure 14.2 Friedrich Miescher (1844â€“1895) discovered nucleic acids.
