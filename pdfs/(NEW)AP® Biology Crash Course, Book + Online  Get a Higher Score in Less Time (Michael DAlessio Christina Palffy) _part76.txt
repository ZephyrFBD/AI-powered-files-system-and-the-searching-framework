Kinetochore
Proteins
Allows for the attachment of the mitotic spindle
to the centromere
Nucleosomes
Histone proteins and DNA
Aids in packaging of DNA
Telomeres
Ends of DNA
Protection against the destruction of the DNA
from nucleases
Remember: Eukaryotic DNA is linear, meaning it has definite ends.
Most eukaryotic organisms are diploid. Fungi, such as yeast, can exist as haploid or diploid.
B. Structure and Function of Prokaryotic Chromosome as a Comparison
1. Circular in shape and much smaller than eukaryotic chromosome.
2. Genes are arranged in operons—one promoter controlling many genes.
3. Transcription and translation are coupled processes.
4. Plasmids are prevalent—extra chromosomal pieces of DNA that carry antibiotic resistance. They are
not part of the chromosome. Autonomously replicating.
5. One origin of replication.
6. No histone proteins to condense, but DNA is supercoiled.
