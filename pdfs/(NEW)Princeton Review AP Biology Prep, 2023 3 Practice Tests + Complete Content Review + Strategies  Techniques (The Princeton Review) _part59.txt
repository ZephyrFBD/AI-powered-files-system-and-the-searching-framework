the tank osmolality. Choices
(B) and (C) directly increase the organism osmolality. Choice (D) decreases the tankâ€™s osmolality.

C
The goal of an osomconformer is to mimic the osmolarity of its surroundings. An isotonic solution has the
same concentration as its surroundings. Therefore, an osmoconformer would become isotonic to its tank.
5.
A
If Organism 1 decreases osmolality, it means that the tank must have decreased in osmolality. In other words,
it gained water or lost solute. Choice (B) increases the tank solute. Choice (D) decreases the water. Choice (C)
does not directly relate to the osmolality. Only (A) would cause the tank to gain water as water is removed
from the new organism by osmosis.

C
RZN45 is the enzyme and it binds to JB-76. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an inhibitor of this reaction and
binding to JB-76 is reduced, which suggests the inhibitor binds to the same place as the substrate. The graph
confirms that the inhibition is competitive since it shows a decrea
