BLAST? How does 
this limitation impact the proper analysis of the gene data used in this lab? 
What other data could be collected from the fossil specimen to help properly identify 
its evolutionary history? 
■ Designing and Conducting Your Investigation 
Now that you’ve completed this investigation, you should feel more comfortable using 
BLAST. The next step is to learn how to find and BLAST your own genes of interest. To 
locate a gene, you will go to the Entrez Gene website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
gene
 
). Once you have found the gene on the website, you can copy the gene sequence 
and input it into a BLAST query.  
Example Procedure 
One student’s starting question: What is the function of actin in humans? Do other 
organisms have actin? If so, which ones? 
1. Go to the Entrez Gene website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) and search 
for “human actin.” 
2. Click on the first link that appears and scroll down to the section “NCBI Reference 
Sequences.” 
3. Under “mRNA and
