of every individual will give rise to a unique pattern of bands when cut with a particular
set of restriction endonucleases; this is sometimes referred to as an individual’s DNA “fingerprint.” Certain regions of
the chromosome that are subject to polymorphism will lead to the generation of the unique banding pattern. VNTRs
are repeated sets of nucleotides present in the non-coding regions of DNA. Non-coding, or “junk,” DNA has no known
biological function; however, research shows that much of this DNA is actually transcribed. While its function is uncertain,
it is certainly active, and it may be involved in the regulation of coding genes. The number of repeats may vary in individual
organisms of a population. Microsatellite polymorphisms are similar to VNTRs, but the repeat unit is very small. SNPs are
variations in a single nucleotide.
Because genetic maps rely completely on the natural process of recombination, mapping is affected by natural increases
or decreases in the level of rec
