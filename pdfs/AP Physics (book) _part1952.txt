rought close, a spark was produced. Volta had designed and built the first
electric battery. He published his discovery in 1800.

his battery to Napoleon in 1801.
†Volta’s most sensitive electroscope (Section 16–4) measured about 40 V per degree (angle of leaf
separation). Nonetheless, he was able to estimate the potential differences produced by combina-
tions of dissimilar metals in contact. For a silver–zinc contact he got about 0.7 V, remarkably close to
today’s value of 0.78 V.
Electric Cells and Batteries
A battery produces electricity by transforming chemical energy into electrical
energy. Today a great variety of electric cells and batteries are available, from
flashlight batteries to the storage battery of a car. The simplest batteries contain
two plates or rods made of dissimilar metals (one can be carbon) called
