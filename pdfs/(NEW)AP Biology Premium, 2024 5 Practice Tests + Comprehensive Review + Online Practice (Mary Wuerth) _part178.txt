formed at a temperature of 50°C and no oxygen was
produced. Explain why the enzyme would not function at 50°C.

13. Amylase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of amylose into its glucose subunits. The activity of
amylase was measured at 37° Celsius and a pH of 7, both of which are optimum conditions for the activity of
this enzyme. The production of glucose was measured both with and without the presence of compound X.
Data are shown in the following table:

(a) On the axes provided, construct an appropriately labeled graph of this data.
(b) Based on the data and your graph from part (a), identify compound X as either: a cofactor, a competitive
inhibitor, or a noncompetitive inhibitor of amylase. Justify your answer with evidence from the
