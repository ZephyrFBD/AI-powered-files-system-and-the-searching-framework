 
Currently, renewable sources provide about 9.9% of the U.S. annual energy consump-
tion. Electricity is typically generated by using a moving gas or liquid to turn a turbine 
that is connected to a generator, although there are some exceptions like solar cells.  Of 
the 4.0 * 1013 kJ of electricity consumed in 2015 in the United States approximately
