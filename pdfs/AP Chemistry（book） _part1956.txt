which shows metallic behavior. Right: 
“Zigzag” nanotube, which can be either 
semiconducting or metallic, depending on 
tube diameter.

Polymers that can conduct electricity are called conducting polymers. Some polymers can be made semiconducting; others can be 
nearly metallic. Polyacetylene is an example of a polymer that is a semiconductor. It can also be doped to increase its conductivity.
 
Polyacetylene is made from acetylene in a reaction that looks simple but is actually tricky to do:

(a) What is the hybridization of the carbon atoms, and the geometry around those atoms, in acetylene and in polyacetylene?
(b) Write a balanced equation to make polyacetylene from acetylene.
