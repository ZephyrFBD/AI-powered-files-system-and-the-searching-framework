by an actin ring during cytokinesis in animal cells that leads to cytoplasmic division
proteins that help sister chromatids coil during prophase
one of a group of proteins that act in conjunction with cyclin-dependent kinases to help regulate the cell cycle by
phosphorylating key proteins; the concentrations of cyclins fluctuate throughout the cell cycle
one of a group of protein kinases that helps to regulate the cell cycle when bound to cyclin; it
functions to phosphorylate other proteins that are either activated or inactivated by phosphorylation
division of the cytoplasm following mitosis that forms two daughter cells.
cell, nucleus, or organism containing two sets of chromosomes (2n)
tubulin-like protein component of the prokaryotic cytoskeleton that is important in prokaryotic cytokinesis (name
origin: Filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant Z)
distinct from the G1 phase of interphase; a cell in G0 is not preparing to divide
(also, first gap) first phase of interphase centered o
