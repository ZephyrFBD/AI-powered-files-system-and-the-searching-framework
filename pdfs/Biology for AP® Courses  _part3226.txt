sound wave shown with a dashed line is softer in volume than the sound wave shown with a solid line. (credit: NIH)
Reception of Sound
In mammals, sound waves are collected by the external, cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna, then travel through
the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum, the innermost part of
the outer ear (illustrated in Figure 27.13). Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear. The middle ear holds three small
bones called the ossicles, which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear. The three ossicles are the
malleus (also known as the hammer), the incus (the anvil), and stapes (the stirrup). The aptly named stapes looks very
much like a stirrup. The three ossicles are unique to mammals, and each plays a role in hearing. The malleus attaches at
three points to the interior surface of the tympanic membrane. The incus attaches the malleus to the stapes. In hum
