ent of energy conservation: the heat Q added to a system minus the net work W done by the system equals 
the change in internal energy 
of the system:
There are many uses for a heat
engine such as a modern coal-
burning power plant, or a steam
locomotive. The photograph shows a
steam locomotive which produces
steam that does work on a piston 
that moves linkage to turn locomotive
wheels. The efficiency of any engine is
limited by nature as described in the
second law of thermodynamics. This
great law is best stated in terms of a
quantity called entropy, which is not
conserved, but instead is constrained
always to increase in any real process.
Entropy is a measure of disorder.
The second law of thermodynamics
tells us that as time moves forward,
the disorder in the universe increases.
We also discuss practical matters such
as heat engines, heat pumps,
refrigerators, and air conditioners.
¢U = Q - W.
