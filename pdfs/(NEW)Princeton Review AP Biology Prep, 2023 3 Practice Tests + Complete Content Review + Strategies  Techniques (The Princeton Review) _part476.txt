Time-Course Experiments
Time-course experiments look at how something changes over time. A line graph is usually used to present this
type of data. Several lines can be plotted on the same graph, but these must be clearly labeled. Also, each dot on a
line graph could represent one data point or a mean of values. If mean values are plotted, standard deviation or
standard error can also be shown. More generally, line graphs can also be used to compare the way in which a
dependent variable (y-axis) changes in relation to an independent variable (x-axis).
When making line graphs, the intervals on the axes must be consistent. Also make sure it is clear whether the data
starts at the origin (0, 0) or not. The same guidelines apply to scatterplots, which will be discussed below.
Data points should be connected with a solid line. You can extrapolate (extend) the line past the data points, but then
you must use a broken line. Finally, the slope on a line
