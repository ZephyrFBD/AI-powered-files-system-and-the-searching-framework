own as products in the oxidation process and as reactants in 
the reduction process.
Equations that show either oxidation or reduction alone, such as Equations 20.4 
and 20.5, are called half-reactions. In the overall redox reaction, the number of elec-
trons lost in the oxidation half-reaction must equal the number of electrons gained in 
the reduction half-reaction. When this condition is met and each half-reaction is bal-
anced, the electrons on the two sides cancel when the two half-reactions are added to 
give the balanced oxidation–reduction equation.
Balancing Equations by the Method of half-Reactions
In the half-reaction method, we usually begin with a “skeleton” ionic equation show-
ing only the substances undergoing oxidation and reduction. In such cases, we assign 
oxidation numbers only when we are unsure whether the reaction involves oxidation–
reduction. We will find that H+ (for acidic solutions), OH- (for basic solutions), and H2O 
are often involved as reactants or pro
