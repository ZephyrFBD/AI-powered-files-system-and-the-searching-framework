Converting Concentration Units
If you follow the dimensional analysis techniques you learned in Chapter 1, you can con-
vert between concentration units, as shown in Sample Exercise 13.5. To convert between 
molality and molarity, the density of the solution will be needed, as in Sample Exercise 13.6.
An aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid contains 36% HCl by mass. (a) Calculate the mole fraction of HCl in the solution.  
(b) Calculate the molality of HCl in the solution.
Sample Exercise 13.5 
Calculation of Mole Fraction and Molality
Analyze We are asked to calculate the concentration of the solute, 
HCl, in two related concentration units, given only the percentage 
by mass of the solute in the solution.
SOLUTION
Plan In converting concentration units based on the mass or 
moles of solute and solvent (mass percentage, mole fraction, 
and molality), it is useful to assume a certain total mass of
