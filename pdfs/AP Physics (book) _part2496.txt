g system (GPS) functions by determining
the travel times for EM waves from various satellites to a
land-based GPS receiver. If the receiver is to detect a change
in travel distance on the order of 3 m, what is the associated
change in travel time (in ns) that must be measured?
46. Light is emitted from an ordinary lightbulb filament in wave-
train bursts about 
in duration. What is the length in
space of such wave trains?
47. The voice from an astronaut on the Moon (Fig. 22–22) was
beamed to a listening crowd on Earth. If you were standing
28 m from the loudspeaker on Earth, what was the total
time lag between when
you heard the sound and
when the sound entered
a microphone on the
Moon? Explain whether
the 
microphone 
was
inside the space helmet,
or outside, and why.

that accurately (within a microsecond) marks the beginning
