After the excision of the introns and splicing of the exons, as well as the additions of the 5′ GTP cap and the 3′
poly-A tail, the transcript is now referred to as a mature mRNA and is ready to be translated by the ribosome.
Translation
Translation of mRNA molecules occurs at the ribosomes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Ribosomes are found
in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Ribosomes are also found on the rough endoplasmic reticulum
of eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, cytoplasmic ribosomes usually translate proteins that will stay inside the cell, while
ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum usually translate proteins that will be exported from the cell.
In the human immune system, alternative splicing of exons in the antibody-producing B cells allows for the production of a wide variety of
antibody molecules in response to evolving pathogens.
Because prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, translation of the mRNA can occur as the mRNA is being
transcribed
