ity for one particular
epitope. Once activated, a T cell proliferates and forms a population of
activated T clones. Some of the clones become effector cells, while the
remainder become circulating memory cells that can rapidly respond to
any exposure to the same antigen many years later. These memory cells
are responsible for immunological memory and are the reason that a
person does not generally get measles or chickenpox a second time.
REMEMBER
All mammalian immune systems include two types of specific responses: cell-mediated and
humoral. This commonality reflects shared ancestry.
The two main types of T cells are helper T cells (Th) and cytotoxic T
cells (Tc). Helper T cells are activated by an interaction with an APC.
Cytotoxic T cells are activated by helper T cells. Once activated, Th cells
announce to the immune system that foreign antigens have entered the
body. They trigger both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. In
addition to activating other helper T cells, Th cel
