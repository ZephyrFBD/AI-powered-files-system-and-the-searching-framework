hydrogen-like ions—ions that 
have only one electron, such as He +  and Li2 +. (a) Why is 
the Bohr model applicable to He +  ions but not to neutral He 
 
atoms? (b) The ground-state energies of H, He +, and Li2 +  are 
tabulated as follows:
Atom or ion
H
He +
Li2 +
Ground-state 
energy
-2.18 * 10 - 18 J
-8.72 * 10 - 18 J
-1.96 * 10 - 17 J
 
 By examining these numbers, propose a relationship between 
the ground-state energy of hydrogen-like systems and the 
 
nuclear charge, Z. (c) Use the relationship you derive in part 
(b) to predict the ground-state energy of the C5 +  ion.
 [6.95]  An electron is accelerated through an electric potential to 
a kinetic energy of 2.15 * 10-15 J. What is its characteristic 
wavelength? [Hint: Recall that the kinetic energy of a moving 
object is E = 1
2 mv2, where m is the mass of the object and n is 
the speed of the object.]
