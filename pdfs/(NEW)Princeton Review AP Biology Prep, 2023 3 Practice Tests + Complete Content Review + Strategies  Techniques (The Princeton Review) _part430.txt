r cyanobacterium—living in a complex symbiotic relationship.
Cyanobacteria are bacteria that can perform photosynthesis. They contain
chlorophyll pigments but do not contain chloroplast organelles. Algae are
eukaryotic protists that can perform photosynthesis.
Overall, there are three basic types of symbiotic relationships:
Mutualism—in which both organisms win (for example, the lichen components)
Commensalism—in which one organism lives off another with no harm to the host organism (for example, the
remora)
Parasitism—in which the organism actually harms its host
There are many special types of relationships between multicellular organisms and unicellular organisms. One
important example is bacteria living inside the guts of many mammals. We have a mutualistic relationship. Humans
and other mammals provide the bacteria a nice home with nutrients, and they help us in many ways by breaking
things down and helping us make things. It is also good that we are filled with “good” bacteria be
