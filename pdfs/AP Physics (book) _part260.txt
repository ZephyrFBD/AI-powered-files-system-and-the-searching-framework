Adding Vectors by Components
57
Pay careful attention to signs: any component that
points along the negative x or y axis gets a minus sign.
5. Add the x components together to get the x compo-
nent of the resultant. Similarly for y:
This is the answer: the components of the resultant
vector. Check signs to see if they fit the quadrant
shown in your diagram (point 1 above).
6. If you want to know the magnitude and direction of
the resultant vector, use Eqs. 3–4:
The vector diagram you already drew helps to obtain
the correct position (quadrant) of the angle u.

Adding Vectors
Here is a brief summary of how to add two or more
vectors using components:
1. Draw a diagram, adding the vectors graphically by
either the parallelogram or tail-to-tip method.
2. Choose x and y axes. Choose them in a way, if possible,
that will make your
