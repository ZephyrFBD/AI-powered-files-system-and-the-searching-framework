CHAPTER 12 Solids and Modern Materials
The extended structure of a hexagonal close-packed metal is shown in 
Figure 12.14(a). There are two atoms in the primitive hexagonal unit cell, one from each 
layer. Neither atom sits directly on the lattice points, which are located at the corners of 
the unit cell. The presence of two atoms in the unit cell is consistent with the two-layer 
ABAB stacking sequence associated with hcp packing.
Although it is not immediately obvious, the structure that results from cubic close 
packing possesses a unit cell that is identical to the face-centered cubic unit cell we 
encountered earlier [Figure 12.11(c)]. The relationship between the ABC layer stacking 
and the face-centered cubic unit cell is shown in Figure 12.14(b). In this figure, we see 
that the layers stack perpendicular to the body diagonal of the cubic unit cell.
It is not possible to pack
