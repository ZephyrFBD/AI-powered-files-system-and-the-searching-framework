chlorous acid. Conse-
quently, the ClO- ion acts as a weak base in water:
 
ClO-1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ HClO1aq2 + OH-1aq2  Kb = 3.3 * 10-7

In Figure 16.6 we saw that bleach is quite basic (pH values of 12–13). Common chlo-
rine bleach is typically a 5% NaOCl solution.
Check The value obtained for x is only about 1% of the NH3 concen-
tration, 0.15 M. Therefore, neglecting x relative to 0.15 was justified.
Comment You may be asked to find the pH of a solution of 
a weak base. Once you have found 3OH-4, you can proceed 
as in Sample Exercise 16.9, where we calculated the pH of a 
strong base. In the present sample exercise, we have seen that 
the 0.15 M solution of NH3 contains 3OH-4 =  1.6 * 10-3 M. 
Thus, pOH = -log11.6 * 10-32 = 2.80, and pH =
14.00 - 2.80 = 11.20. The pH of the solution is above 7 because 
we are dealing with a solution of a base.
