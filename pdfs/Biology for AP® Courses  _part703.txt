 mole of ATP in a living cell is almost double the value at standard conditions: -14 kcal/mol (−57 kJ/mol).
ATP is a highly unstable molecule. Unless quickly used to perform work, ATP spontaneously dissociates into ADP + Pi, and
the free energy released during this process is lost as heat. The second question posed above, that is, how the energy released
by ATP hydrolysis is used to perform work inside the cell, depends on a strategy called energy coupling. Cells couple the
exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis with endergonic reactions, allowing them to proceed. One example of energy coupling
using ATP involves a transmembrane ion pump that is extremely important for cellular function. This sodium-potassium
pump (Na+/K+ pump) drives sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell (Figure 6.14). A large percentage of a cell’s
ATP is spent powering this pump, because cellular processes bring a great deal of sodium into the cell and potassium out
of the cell. The pump works constantly
