of gene mutation results from a single nucleotide insertion
or deletion. To continue the three-letter word analogy, a deletion is the
loss of one letter, and an insertion is the addition of a letter into the DNA
sentence. Both mutations result in a frameshift, because the entire
reading frame is altered.
IST-2 & IST-4
Changes in genotype can result in changes in phenotype.
Deletion of the letter E shifts the reading frame:
↓
THE FAT CAT SAW THE DOG → THF ATC ATS AWT HED OG
Insertion of the letter T shifts the reading frame:
↓
THE FAT CAT SAW THE DOG → THE FTA TCA TSA WTH EDO G
As a result of the frameshift, one of two things can happen. Either a
mutated polypeptide is formed or no polypeptide is formed.
THE GENETICS OF VIRUSES AND BACTERIA
Since the early part of the twentieth century when Griffith discovered the
transformation factor, knowledge of genetics has been based on work with
