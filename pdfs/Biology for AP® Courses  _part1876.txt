Transgenic Plants
Manipulating the DNA of plants (i.e., creating GMOs) has helped to create desirable traits, such as disease resistance,
herbicide and pesticide resistance, better nutritional value, and better shelf-life (Figure 17.9). Plants are the most important
source of food for the human population. Farmers developed ways to select for plant varieties with desirable traits long
before modern-day biotechnology practices were established.

plant biotechnology. (credit: Keith Weller, USDA)
Plants that have received recombinant DNA from other species are called transgenic plants. Because they are not natural,
transgenic plants and other GMOs are closely monitored by government agencies to ensure that they are fit for human
