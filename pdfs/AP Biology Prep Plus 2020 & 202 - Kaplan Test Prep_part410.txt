ATP GENERATION AND THE PROTON PUMP
The electron carriers are categorized into three large protein complexes
(NADH dehydrogenase, the cytochrome b–c1 complex, and cytochrome
oxidase), as well as the carrier molecule Q. There are energy losses as the
electrons are transferred from one complex to the next; this energy is
then used to synthesize 1 ATP per complex. Thus, an electron passing
through the entire ETC supplies enough energy to generate 3 ATP. NADH
delivers its electrons to the NADH dehydrogenase complex so that for
each NADH, 3 ATP are produced. However, FADH2 bypasses the NADH
dehydrogenase complex and delivers its electrons directly to carrier Q
(ubiquinone), which lies between the NADH dehydrogenase and
cytochrome b–c1 complexes. Therefore, for each FADH2, there are only
two energy drops, and only 2 ATP are produced.
 
The operating mechanism in this type of ATP production involves
coupling the oxidation of NADH and FAD
