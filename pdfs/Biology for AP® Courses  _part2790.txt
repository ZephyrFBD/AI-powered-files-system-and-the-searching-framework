es, if the peak abundance of
Japanese beetles is shifted from 18 July to 13 July, and
80% of leaf area is lost.
The expression of genes involved in seed development is
temperature dependent, unlike the scenario suggested in
part A. More than 90% of soybean seeds planted in 2015
in the soybean-corn ecosystem of the central United States
are the herbicide-resistant, genetically modified “Roundup
Ready” variety. The seed has a patented genome. It
produces seeds that are sterile and must be purchased each
spring from the patent holder.
B. Predict how the use of Roundup Ready seeds affects
the selection of expression regulated in response to
increasing temperature.
Roundup is an herbicide whose active chemical
component is glyphosphate. This molecule disrupts the
synthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. By
inserting a gene from Agrobacteria, a Roundup Ready
seed can synthesize these amino acids in the presence of
the herbicide.
C. Pose two scientific questions that must be cons
