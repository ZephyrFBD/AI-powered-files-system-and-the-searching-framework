bonds
to break completely and allows water molecules to escape into the air as gas (steam or water vapor). On the other hand,
when the temperature of water is reduced and water freezes, the water molecules form a crystalline structure maintained by
hydrogen bonding (there is not enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds) that makes ice less dense than liquid water, a
phenomenon not seen in the solidification of other liquids.
Waterâ€™s lower density in its solid form is due to the way hydrogen bonds are oriented as it freezes: the water molecules are
pushed farther apart compared to liquid water. With most other liquids, solidification when the temperature drops includes
the lowering of kinetic energy between molecules, allowing them to pack even more tightly than in liquid form and giving
the solid a greater density than the liquid.
The lower density of ice, illustrated and pictured in Figure 2.15, an anomaly, causes it to float at the surface of liquid water,
such as in an iceberg or i
