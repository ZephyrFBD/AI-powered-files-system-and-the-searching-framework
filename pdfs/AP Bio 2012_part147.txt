f an organism, 
and these events are regulated by a variety of mechanisms.
Science Practice
7.1: The student can connect phenomena and models 
across spatial and temporal scales.
Learning Objective 
2.34: The student is able to describe the role of 
programmed cell death in development and 
differentiation, the reuse of molecules, and the 
maintenance of dynamic homeostasis.
(A)
This option is correct. It demonstrates understanding of dynamic homeostasis 
in the reuse of nutrients by the body in development.
(B)
This option is incorrect. Shedding the tail in this stage of development is not 
necessary to conserve energy. 
(C)
This option is incorrect. The tail does not divide bilaterally during development.
(D)
This option is incorrect. There is no evidence that cells of the tail migrate 
to gonads.
