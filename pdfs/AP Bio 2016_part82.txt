roduced into living cells. By engineering the 
expression of GFP* in laboratory-cultured nerve cells, the researchers found that a bright green fluorescence was 
exhibited only when a presynaptic neuron was given a certain stimulus.
43. Based on the model, which of the following best
explains why a bright green fluorescence was
observed following stimulation of a presynaptic
neuron?
(A) GFP* synthesis was activated when a gene
taken up by the neuron was switched on. 
(B) GFP* stored in the cytoplasm of the neuron
was packaged into synaptic vesicles. 
(C) GFP* contained in synaptic vesicles moved
into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis. 
(D) GFP* present in the synaptic cleft was
reabsorbed by endocytosis into the neuron. 
44. Which of the following best explains why GFP*
might exhibit a bright green fluorescence in
alkaline conditions but not in acidic conditions?
(A) Addition of an H+ to GFP* at acidic pH
changes the shape of the protein, 
preventing fluorescence. 
(B) CDK5 is a degradi
