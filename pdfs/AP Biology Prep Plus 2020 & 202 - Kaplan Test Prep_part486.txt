be in interphase and one-quarter in mitosis.
With a sample of 653 total cells, that means that about 490 should be
in interphase and 163 in mitosis. This allows the following chi-square
calculation:

χ2 = 59.07
Because 59.07 is greater than 3.84 (the significance threshold for p =
0.05 with 1 degree of freedom), the eﬀect of the insecticide is
statistically significant. (C) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because it
suggests the eﬀect is not significant. (B) and (D) are incorrect because
they wrongly suggest that the chi-square value is less than 3.84.

Learning Objective: 11.3
Nondisjunction is an error in the separation of chromosomes, which
can occur during meiosis (in either meiosis I or meiosis II) and which
leads to genetic abnormalities. It produces gametes with either one
missing or one extra chromosome. (D) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect
because c
