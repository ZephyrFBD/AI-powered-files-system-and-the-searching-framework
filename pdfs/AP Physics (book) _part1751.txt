Make the force on 
zero. In Fig. 16–20,
where could you place a fourth charge,
so that the net force on 
would be zero?
RESPONSE By the principle of superposition, we need a force in exactly the
opposite direction to the resultant 
due to 
and 
that we calculated in
Example 16–4, Fig. 16–20b. Our force must have magnitude 290 N, and must
point down and to the left of 
in Fig. 16–20b, in the direction opposite to 
So 
must be along this line. See Fig. 16–21.

EXERCISE E (a) Consider two point charges,
which are fixed a distance d
apart. Can you find a location where a third positive charge Q could be placed so that
the net electric force on this third charge is zero? (b) What if the first two charges were
both ±Q?
