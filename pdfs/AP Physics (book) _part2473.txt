ically and is then mixed with a radio-frequency (RF) signal called its
carrier frequency, which represents that station. AM radio stations have carrier
frequencies from about 530 kHz to 1700 kHz. For example, “710 on your dial”
means a station whose carrier frequency is 710 kHz. FM radio stations have much
higher carrier frequencies, between 88 MHz and 108 MHz. The carrier frequencies
for broadcast TV stations in the United States lie between 54 MHz and 72 MHz,
between 76 MHz and 88 MHz, between 174 MHz and 216 MHz, and between 
470 MHz and 698 MHz. Today’s digital broadcasting (see Sections 17–10 and 17–11)
uses the same frequencies as the pre-2009 analog transmission.
