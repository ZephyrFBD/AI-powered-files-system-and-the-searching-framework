mosomes will show one of the parental types (i.e., Ab and aB).
If there is a high level of recombination, then about half of the
chromosomes will be recombinant, nonparental types (AB and ab) and
about half will be parental types (Ab and aB). Thus, the correct answer
is (D). (A) is incorrect because, depending on the location of crossing
over, the A and B genes may or may not be on diﬀerent sides of the
strand breakage, so a mixture of all four gametes (AB, ab, Ab, and
aB) will not always be produced. (B) is incorrect because, if crossing
over occurs, the individual can produce all four gametes (AB, ab, Ab,
and aB). (C) is incorrect because the individual will produce Ab and aB
gametes, not AB and ab gametes, if crossing over does not occur.
