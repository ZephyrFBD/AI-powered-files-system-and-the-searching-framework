An object at rest is said to be in equilibrium. The subject con-
cerned with the determination of the forces within a structure
at rest is called statics.
The two necessary conditions for an object to be in equi-
librium are (1) the vector sum of all the forces on it must 
be zero, and (2) the sum of all the torques (calculated about
any arbitrary axis) must also be zero. For a two-dimensional
problem we can write
(9;1, 9;2)
It is important when doing statics problems to apply the
equilibrium conditions to only one object at a time.
An object in static equilibrium is said to be in (a) stable,
(b) unstable, or (c) neutral equilibrium, depending on whether a
slight displacement leads to (a) a return to the original position,
(b) further movement away from the original position, or 
(c) rest in the new position. An object in stable equilibrium is
also said to be in balance.
Hooke’s law applies to many elastic solids, a
