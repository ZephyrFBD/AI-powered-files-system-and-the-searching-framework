The bulk of the semen comes from the accessory glands associated with the male reproductive system. These are the seminal
vesicles, the prostate gland, and the bulbourethral gland, all of which are illustrated in Figure 34.10. The seminal vesicles
are a pair of glands that lie along the posterior border of the urinary bladder. The glands make a solution that is thick,
yellowish, and alkaline. As sperm are only motile in an alkaline environment, a basic pH is important to reverse the acidity
of the vaginal environment. The solution also contains mucus, fructose (a sperm mitochondrial nutrient), a coagulating
enzyme, ascorbic acid, and local-acting hormones called prostaglandins. The seminal vesicle glands account for 60 percent
of the bulk of semen.
The penis, illustrated in Figure 34.10, is an organ that drains urine from the renal bladder and functions as a copulatory
organ during intercourse. The penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue running through the length of the orga
