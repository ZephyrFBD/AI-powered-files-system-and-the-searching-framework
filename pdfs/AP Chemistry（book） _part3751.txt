 metals are 
larger than those of period 4 metals. The transition metals of periods 
5 and 6 have comparable atomic and ionic radii and are also similar 
in other properties. This similarity is due to the lanthanide contraction.
The presence of unpaired electrons in valence orbitals leads 
to magnetic behavior in transition metals and their compounds. 
In ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic substances, the 
unpaired electron spins on atoms in a solid are affected by spins on 
neighboring atoms. In a ferromagnetic substance the spins all point 
in the same direction. In an antiferromagnetic substance the spins 
point in opposite directions and cancel one another. In a ferrimag-
netic substance the spins point in opposite directions but do not 
fully cancel. Ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic substances are used to 
make permanent magnets.

compounds are substances that contain metal complexes. Metal com-
plexes contain
