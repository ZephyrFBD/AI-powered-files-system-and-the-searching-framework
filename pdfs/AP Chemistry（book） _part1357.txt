would lead to an electronegativity of 4.0 
for F under this definition. (d) Use your result from part (c) 
to determine the electronegativities of Cl and O using this 
scale. (e) Another scale for electronegativity defines electro-
negativity as the average of an atom’s first ionization energy 
and its electron affinity. Using this scale, calculate the elec-
tronegativities for the halogens, and scale them so that fluo-
rine has an electronegativity of 4.0. On this scale, what is Br’s 
electronegativity?
 8.103 The compound chloral hydrate, known in detective sto-
ries as knockout drops, is composed of 14.52% C, 1.83% H, 
64.30% Cl, and 13.35% O by mass, and has a molar mass 
of 165.4 g>mol. (a) What is the empirical formula of this 
substance? (b) What is the molecular formula of this sub-
stance? (c) Draw the Lewis structure of the molecule, as-
suming that the Cl atoms bond to a single C atom and 
that there are a C ¬C bond and two C ¬O bonds in the 
compound.
