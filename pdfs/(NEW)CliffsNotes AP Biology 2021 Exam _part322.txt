s.
5. The lagging complementary strand (5A) is assembled away from the replication fork in multiple, short Okazaki
fragments (5B). Each new Okazaki fragment begins when DNA polymerase attaches to an RNA primer (5C).
6. The Okazaki fragments are joined by DNA ligase.
7. The RNA primers are replaced with DNA nucleotides.
Energy for elongation is provided by two additional phosphates that are attached to each new nucleotide (making a
total of three phosphates attached to the nitrogen base). Breaking the bonds holding the two extra phosphates
provides the chemical energy for the process.

DNA replication in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms is basically the same with the following differences:
 
1. Chromosome structure. A prokaryotic chromosome is circular. Eukaryotic chromosomes are linear with ends
called telomeres.
2. Origins of replications. A prokaryotic chromosome has one, unique origin of replication. Eukaryotes have
multiple origins to accommodate the much larger size
