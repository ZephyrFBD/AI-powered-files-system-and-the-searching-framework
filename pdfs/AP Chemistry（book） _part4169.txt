 isolated atom gains an electron to form a 1- ion and has units 
of energy. Electronegativity has no units, and is the ability of the 
atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself within that mol-
ecule. page 312 IF; because the difference in electronegativity 
between I and F is greater than that between Cl and F, the magni-
tude of Q should be greater for IF. In addition, because I has a larger 
atomic radius than Cl, the bond length in IF is longer than that 
in ClF. Thus, both Q and r are larger for IF and, therefore, m = Qr 
will be larger for IF. page 313 Smaller dipole moment for C ¬ H. 
The magnitude of Q should be similar for C ¬ H and H ¬ I bonds 
because the difference in electronegativity for each bond is 0.4. 
The C ¬ H bond length is 1.1 Å and the H ¬ I bond length is 1.6 Å. 
Therefore m = Qr will be greater for H ¬ I because it has a longer 
bond (larger r). page 315 OsO4. The data suggest that the yellow 
substance is a molecular species with its low melting and bo
