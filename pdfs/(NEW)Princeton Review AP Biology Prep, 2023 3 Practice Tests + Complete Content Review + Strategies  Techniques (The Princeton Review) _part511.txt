tory rate of germinating and nongerminating seeds and small insects is investigated. The
equation for cellular respiration is
C6H12O6 + O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O
Germinating seeds respire and need to consume oxygen in order to continue to grow. Non-germinating seeds do not
respire actively. In this lab, the amount of oxygen consumed by these types of seeds is measured with a
respirometer. The experiment is also conducted at two temperatures, 25°C and 10°C, because seeds consume more
oxygen at higher temperatures. You should know the following:
Oxygen is consumed in cellular respiration.
Germinating seeds have a higher respiratory rate than non-germinating seeds, which have a very low respiratory
rate.
Know how to design a study to determine the effect of temperature on cell respiration.
Know the significance of a control using glass beads. A control is a condition held constant during an
experiment. In this case, glass beads are used as a control because they will not consume any oxygen.
