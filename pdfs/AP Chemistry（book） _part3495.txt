Give It Some Thought
Nitrogen is found in nature as N21g2. Would you expect phosphorus to be found in 
nature as P21g2? Explain.
Chemical Reactions
Because O2 and H2O are abundant in our environment, it is particularly important to 
consider how these substances react with other compounds. About one-third of the reac-
tions discussed in this chapter involve either O2 (oxidation or combustion reactions) or 
H2O (especially proton-transfer reactions).
In combustion reactions 
 (Section 3.2), hydrogen-containing compounds produce 
H2O. Carbon-containing ones produce CO2 (unless the amount of O2 is insufficient, in which 
case CO or even C can form). Nitrogen-containing compounds tend to form N2, although NO 
can form in special cases or in small amounts. A reaction illustrating these points is:
 
4 CH3NH21g2 + 9 O21g2 ยก 4 CO21g2 + 10 H2O1g2 + 2 N21g2
