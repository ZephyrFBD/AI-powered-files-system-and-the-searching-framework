helps in the formation of phosphodiester
bonds.
Table 14.1 summarizes the enzymes involved in prokaryotic DNA replication and the functions of each.
Prokaryotic DNA Replication: Enzymes and Their Functions
Enzyme/protein
Specific Function
DNA pol I
Exonuclease activity removes RNA primer and replaces with newly
synthesized DNA
DNA pol II
Repair function
DNA pol III
Main enzyme that adds nucleotides in the 5'-3' direction
Helicase
Opens the DNA helix by breaking hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous
bases
Ligase
Seals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments to create one continuous DNA
strand
Primase
Synthesizes RNA primers needed to start replication
Sliding Clamp
Helps to hold the DNA polymerase in place when nucleotides are being added
Topoisomerase
Helps relieve the stress on DNA when unwinding by causing breaks and then
resealing the DNA
Single-strand binding
proteins (SSB)
Binds to single-stranded DNA to avoid DNA rewinding back.
