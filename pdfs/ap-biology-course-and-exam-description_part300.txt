in how the results of 
an investigation explain a 
biological principle.
Connect observational data 
to a broader theory.
Have students read 
excerpts from the article 
“On the Origin of Mitosing 
Cells” by Lynn Sagan 
(Margulis), and identify the 
claims made in the article 
about endosymbiosis and 
the evidence to support the 
claim. (Note: The article is 
long, so it is not advisable 
for students to read it 
in its entirety.) Students 
should then learn about 
the work of Schwartz and 
Dayhoff, who obtained 
experimental results to 
support Margulis’s claim, 
and then explain how the 
results support the theory 
of endosymbiosis.
