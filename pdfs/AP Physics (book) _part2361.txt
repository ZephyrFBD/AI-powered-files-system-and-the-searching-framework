Seismograph
In geophysics, a seismograph measures the intensity of earthquake waves using a
magnet and a coil of wire. Either the magnet or the coil is fixed to the case, and
the other is inertial (suspended by a spring; Fig. 21–32). The relative motion of
magnet and coil when the surface of the Earth shakes induces an emf output.
Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI)
Fuses and circuit breakers (Sections 18–6 and 20–7) protect buildings from 
electricity-induced fire, and apparatus from damage, due to undesired high cur-
rents. But they do not turn off the current until it is very much greater than that
which can cause permanent damage to humans or death 
If fast
enough, they may pro
