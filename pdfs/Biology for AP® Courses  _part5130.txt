Hospital, says the tests are really a ‘vaccine’. Cows have long been
vaccinated this way. She points out that masks have to cover the nose
and the mouth where it is claimed the ‘virus’ exists in saliva. Why
then don’t they take saliva from the mouth as they do with a DNA
test instead of pushing a long swab up the nose towards the brain?
The ethmoid bone separates the nasal cavity from the brain and
within that bone is the cribriform plate. Dr Day says that when the
swab is pushed up against this plate and twisted the procedure is
‘depositing things back there’. She claims that among these ‘things’

that a team at the Gates-funded Johns Hopkins have designed tiny,
