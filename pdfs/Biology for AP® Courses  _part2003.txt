even when brought back together, they will retain their species identity. There are many
examples of this in nature, including Darwinâ€™s finches, northern and Mexican spotted owls, and Hawaiian honeycreeper.
Adaptive radiation occurs when a single ancestral species gives rise to many new species. This may occur, for example,
when new habitats become available. It can also be seen historically in the rise of mammals following the extinction of
dinosaurs. Other examples of prezygotic isolating mechanisms include mating seasons and unique courtship behaviors.
Sometimes mating occurs between two different species, resulting in a hybrid such as the mule, which is a cross between a
horse and a donkey. However, most hybrids are inviable or sterile.

Sympatric speciation does not require a geographic barrier and explains how many different species can inhabit the same
area. One form of sympatric speciation begins with a serious chromosomal error d
