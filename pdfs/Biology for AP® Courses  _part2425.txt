 led researchers at Imperial College London
to a new insight. Virions communicate with other virions.
The researchers observed that the radius of an
approximately circular plaque of infected cells grew to
1.45 mm in just 3 days. They measured the distance
between adjacent cells to be 0.037 mm to obtain the
apparent time for the lytic cycle (from infection to lysis).
They compared this time to the actual rate at which new
virions are formed: 5 to 6 hours.
A. Predict the radius of infection if the infection process
involved a sequence of entry, replication, lysis, and
infection of an adjacent cell.
To account for this discrepancy between observed and
predicted growth rates, the researchers examined the viral
entry process and discovered that the actin protein on the
host cellâ€™s surface that provided the viral receptor was
modified by attachment. They then found a mutant virus
that did not modify the cell surface protein. The
dependence of the growth of plaque radius on time for the
wild
