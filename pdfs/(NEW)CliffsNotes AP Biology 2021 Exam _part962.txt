 can only be explained by some variable in the experiment and the hypothesis is incorrect (and
must be rejected). If this were the case, answer choices C or D, or some other explanation, could explain the results.
60. C. Comparing plates I and II indicates that both kinds of bacteria can grow on regular agar (with no
tetracycline).
61. A. Comparing plates III and IV indicates that normal bacteria die in the presence of tetracycline, but that at least
some of the treated bacteria survive. This shows that the treated bacteria have successfully absorbed the plasmid and
have expressed the plasmid gene for antibiotic resistance.
62. D. Not all of the treated bacteria were successfully transformed. Some of the bacteria did not absorb the plasmid,
while others may have absorbed the plasmid but were unable to express the antibiotic-resistant gene.
63. B. Some untreated bacteria are resistant to tetracycline. Antibiotic resistance in untreated bacteria may have been
acquired by mutation. Anothe
