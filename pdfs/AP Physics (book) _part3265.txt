ferent energy. (As we saw, only one of these states,
has low
enough energy to give a bound 
molecule.) Figure 29–23a shows this situation
for 1s and 2s states for two atoms: as the two atoms get closer (toward the left in
Fig. 29–23a), the 1s and 2s states split into two levels. If six atoms come together,
as in Fig. 29–23b, each of the states splits into six levels. If a large number of
atoms come together to form a solid, then each of the original atomic levels
becomes a band as shown in Fig. 29–23c. The energy levels are so close together
in each band that they seem essentially continuous. This is why the spectrum of
heated solids (Section 27–2) appears continuous. (See also Fig. 29–14 and its
discussion at start of Section 29–4.)
