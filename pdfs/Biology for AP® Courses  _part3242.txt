ed in photoreceptors in the retina?
Vision is the ability to detect light patterns from the outside environment and interpret them into images. Animals are
bombarded with sensory information, and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic. Fortunately, the visual
systems of species have evolved to attend to the most-important stimuli. The importance of vision to humans is further
substantiated by the fact that about one-third of the human cerebral cortex is dedicated to analyzing and perceiving visual
information.
Light
As with auditory stimuli, light travels in waves. The compression waves that compose sound must travel in a medium—a
gas, a liquid, or a solid. In contrast, light is composed of electromagnetic waves and needs no medium; light can travel
in a vacuum (Figure 27.16). The behavior of light can be discussed in terms of the behavior of waves and also in terms
of the behavior of the fundamental unit of light—a packet of electromagnetic radiation called a photon
