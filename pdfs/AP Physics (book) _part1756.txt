Electric field of a single point charge. Calculate the 
magnitude and direction of the electric field at a point P which is 30 cm to the
right of a point charge
APPROACH The magnitude of the electric field due to a single point charge is
given by Eq. 16–4. The direction is found using the sign of the charge Q.
SOLUTION The magnitude of the electric field is:
The direction of the ele
