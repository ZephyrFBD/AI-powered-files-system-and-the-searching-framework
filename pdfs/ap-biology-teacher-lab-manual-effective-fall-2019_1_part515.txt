■ ALIGNMENT TO THE AP BIOLOGY CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK 
This investigation can be conducted during the study of concepts pertaining to 
the storage, retrieval, and transmission of genetic information (big idea 3), with a 
connection to evolution and natural selection (big idea 1). As always, it is important to 
make connections between big ideas and enduring understandings, regardless of where 
in the curriculum the lab is taught. The concepts align with the enduring understandings 
and learning objectives from the AP Biology Curriculum Framework, as indicated below. 
■ Enduring Understanding 
•  IST-1: Heritable information provides a continuity of life. 
■ Learning Objective 
•  IST-1.P: Explain the use of genetic engineering techniques in analyzing or  
manipulating DNA.  
■ Science Skill 
•  6.D: Explain the rela
