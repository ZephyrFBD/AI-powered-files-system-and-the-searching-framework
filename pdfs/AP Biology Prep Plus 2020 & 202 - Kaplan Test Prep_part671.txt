ibution of the beak sizes in the island finches. Which of the
following statements represents the most likely finding of the
survey?
The size of beaks is equally distributed between large and
small because the population experiences stabilizing
selection.
(A)
Most birds have a large beak as a result of genetic driȇ
because the trait was overrepresented in the small founding
population.
(B)
There are more birds with small beaks because it reflects the
makeup of the mainland bird population.
(C)
Most birds have a large beak because it gives a competitive

4. The soil in areas surrounding mines is oȇen polluted with toxic
heavy metals. These toxins prevent most grasses from growing.
Buﬀalo grass is an unusual type of grass that can tolerate heavy
metals in the soil. Populations in polluted areas have evolved a
distinct genotype for tolerating the metal toxins. This resistant
buﬀalo grass grows in close proximity to nonresistant buﬀalo
grass that can only pro
