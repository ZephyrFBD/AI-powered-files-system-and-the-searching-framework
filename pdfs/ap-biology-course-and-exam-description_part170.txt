LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-1.K
Describe the structures

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.K.1
DNA, and in some cases RNA, is the primary 
source of heritable information.
IST-1.K.2
Genetic information is transmitted from one 
generation to the next through DNA or RNA—
a. Genetic information is stored in and 
passed to subsequent generations through 
DNA molecules and, in some cases, 
RNA molecules.
b. Prokaryotic organisms typically have circular 
ch
