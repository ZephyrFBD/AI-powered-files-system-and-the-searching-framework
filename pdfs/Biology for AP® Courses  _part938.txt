 the same amount of energy. Violet has the shortest wavelength and
therefore carries the most energy, whereas red has the longest wavelength and carries the least amount of energy.

Understanding Pigments
Different kinds of pigments exist, and each absorbs only certain wavelengths (colors) of visible light. Pigments reflect or
transmit the wavelengths they cannot absorb, making them appear in the corresponding color.
Chlorophylls and carotenoids are the two major classes of photosynthetic pigments found in plants and algae; each class
has multiple types of pigment molecules. There are five major chlorophylls: a, b, c and d and a related molecule found in
prokaryotes called bacteriochlorophyll. Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be
the focus of the following discussion.
With dozens of different forms, carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments. The carotenoids found in fruitâ€”such as
the red of tomato
