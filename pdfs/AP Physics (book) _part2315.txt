1–3 EMF Induced in a Moving Conductor
Another way to induce an emf is shown in Fig. 21–11a, and this situation helps
illuminate the nature of the induced emf. Assume that a uniform magnetic field 
is perpendicular to the area bounded by the 
conductor and the movable
rod resting on it. If the rod is made to move at a speed 
to the right, it travels a
distance 
in a time 
Therefore, the are
