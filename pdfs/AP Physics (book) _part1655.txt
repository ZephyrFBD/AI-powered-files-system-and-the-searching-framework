ces of a broken cup. Cups break
when they fall, but they do not spontaneously mend themselves (as faked in 
Fig. 15–10). Again, the normal course of events is an increase of disorder.
Let us consider some processes for which we have actually calculated the
entropy change, and see that an increase in entropy results in an increase in dis-
order (or vice versa). When ice melts to water at 0°C, the entropy of the water
increases (Example 15–13). Intuitively, we can think of solid water, ice, as being
more ordered than the less orderly fluid state which can flow all over the place.
This change from order to disorder can be seen more clearly from the molecular
point of view: the orderly arrangement of water molecules in an ice crystal has
changed to the disorderly and somewhat random motion of the molecules in the
fluid state.
When a hot substance is put in contact with a cold substance,heat flows from the high 
temperature to the low until the two substances reach the same intermediate tem
