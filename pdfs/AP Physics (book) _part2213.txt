EXAMPLE 20;9
Magnetic field midway between two currents. Two
parallel straight wires 10.0 cm apart carry currents in opposite directions
(Fig. 20–24). Current
is out of the page, and
is into the
page. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field halfway
between the two wires.
APPROACH The magnitude of the field produced by each wire is calculated
from Eq. 20–6. The direction of each wire’s field is determined with the right-
hand rule. The total field is the vector sum of the two fields at the midway point.
SOLUTION The magnetic field lines due to current 
form circles around the
wire of 
and right-hand-rule-1 (Fig. 20–8d) tells us they point counterclockwise
around the wire. The field lines due to 
form circles around the wire of 
and point clockwise, Fig. 20–24. At the midpoint, both fields point upward in
Fig.20–24 as shown
