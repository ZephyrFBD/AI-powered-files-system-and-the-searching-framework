he east and the Rockies and coastal ranges in
the west, there is a similar trend in biomes. As elevation increases and
temperatures and humidity decrease, one passes through temperate
deciduous forests to taigas to tundras. Here is an overview of the major
biomes of the world.
Tropical Rainforest
Tropical rainforests are found near the equator with abundant
rainfall, stable temperatures, and high humidity.
Although these forests cover only 4 percent of Earth’s land surface,
they account for more than 20 percent of Earth’s net carbon fixation
(food production).
Tropical rainforests have the most diversity of species of any biome
on Earth. They may have as many as 50 times the number of
species of trees as a temperate forest.
Dominant trees are very tall with interlacing tops that form a dense
canopy, keeping the floor of the forest dimly lit even at midday.
The canopy also prevents rain from falling directly onto the forest
floor, but leaves drip rain constantly.
Many trees are covered
