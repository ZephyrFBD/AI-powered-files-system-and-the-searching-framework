ecause they produce more G6PD enzyme.
(C)
Women who are homozygous for the mutant allele and men
who are hemizygous for the mutant allele are not able to
produce any functional G6PD enzyme.

Chromosomes
Chromosomes are condensed bodies of DNA molecules that store codes
for the translation of several diﬀerent kinds of proteins. These proteins
dictate how an organism is put together and functions. In the most
simplified way of looking at the chromosomal theory of inheritance, each
section of DNA that translates a diﬀerent protein is called a gene. For
example, a region of DNA may code for a protein that controls eye color,
so this region of DNA is called the gene for eye color. In other words, a
gene refers to a specific location on a chromosome.
Alleles specifically code for the traits of an organism. In the case of eye
color, there might be an allele for blue eye color and an allele for green
eye color. The eye color that an organism ends up with (its phenotype) is
dictated by which
