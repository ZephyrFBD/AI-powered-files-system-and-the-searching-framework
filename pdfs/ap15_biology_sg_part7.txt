transport chain, as represented in the figures. In cellular respiration, carbohydrates and other metabolites 
are oxidized, and the resulting energy-transfer reactions support the synthesis of ATP. 
(a) Using the information above, describe ONE contribution of each of the following in ATP synthesis. 
• 
Catabolism of glucose in glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation 
• 
Oxidation of intermediates in the Krebs cycle 
• 
Formation of a proton gradient by the electron transport chain 
Process 
Description  
(1 point each box; 3 points maximum) 
Catabolism of glucose in glycolysis and 
pyruvate oxidation 
• Produces NADH for use in ETC 
• Produces acetyl-CoA for entry into Krebs cycle 
• Provides energy for (substrate level) 
phosphorylation of ADP 
Oxidation of intermediates in the Krebs 
cycle 
• Produces NADH or FADH2 for use in ETC 
• Releases high energy electrons for use in ETC 
• Provides energy to pump protons against their 
concentration gradient 
• Produces GTP for (substr
