co City? Assume T = 25 °C.
 18.14  From the data in Table 18.1, calculate the partial pressures 
of carbon dioxide and argon when the total atmospheric 
pressure is 1.05 bar.
 18.15  The average concentration of carbon monoxide in air in 
an Ohio city in 2006 was 3.5 ppm. Calculate the number 
of CO molecules in 1.0 L of this air at a pressure of 759 torr 
and a temperature of 22 °C.
 18.16  (a) From the data in Table 18.1, what is the concentration 
of neon in the atmosphere in ppm? (b) What is the con-
centration of neon in the atmosphere in molecules per 
liter, assuming an atmospheric pressure of 730 torr and a 
temperature of 296 K?
 18.17  The dissociation energy of a carbon–bromine bond is typ-
ically about 276 kJ>mol. (a) What is the maximum wave-
length of photons that can cause C ¬Br bond dissociation? 
(b) Which kind of electromagnetic radiation—ultraviolet, 
visible, or infrared—does the wavelength you calculated in 
part (a) correspond to?
