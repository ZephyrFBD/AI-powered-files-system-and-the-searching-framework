FIGURE 32–1 Ernest O. Lawrence,
left, with Donald Cooksey and the
“dees” of an early cyclotron.
The protons move in a vacuum inside two D-shaped cavities, as shown in Fig. 32–2.
Each time they pass into the gap between the “dees,” a voltage accelerates them
(the electric force), increasing their speed and increasing the radius of curvature
of their path in the magnetic field. After many revolutions, the protons acquire
high kinetic energy and reach the outer edge of the cyclotron where they strike 
a target. The protons speed up only when they are in the gap between the dees,
and the voltage must be alternating. When protons are moving to the right across
the gap in Fig. 32–2, the right dee must be electrically negative and the left one
positive. A half-cycle later, the protons are moving to the left, so the left dee must
be negative in order to accelerate them.
