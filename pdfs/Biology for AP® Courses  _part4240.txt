 found here and carry out
photosynthesis, providing the base of the food web of lakes and ponds. Zooplankton, such as rotifers and small crustaceans,
consume these phytoplankton. At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in the aphotic zone break down dead organisms
that sink to the bottom.

Nitrogen and phosphorus are important limiting nutrients in lakes and ponds. Because of this, they are determining factors
in the amount of phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds. When there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus (from
sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms, for example), the growth of algae skyrockets, resulting in a large
accumulation of algae called an algal bloom. Algal blooms (Figure 35.25) can become so extensive that they reduce light
penetration in water. As a result, the lake or pond becomes aphotic and photosynthetic plants cannot su
