you will explore the following questions:
•
What are the reactions in the Calvin cycle described as the light-independent reactions?
•
Why does the term “carbon fixation” describe the products of the Calvin cycle?
•
What is the role of photosynthesis in the energy cycle of all living organisms?
Connection for AP® Courses
The free energy stored in ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions is used to power the chemical
reactions of the light-independent reactions or Calvin cycle, which can occur during both the day and night. In the Calvin
cycle, an enzyme called ribulose biphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO), catalyzes a reaction with CO2 and another molecule
called ribulose biphosphate (RuBP) that is regenerated from a previous Calvin cycle. After a series of chemical reactions,
the carbon from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is “fixed” into carbohydrates, specifically a three-carbon molecule called
glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate (G3P). (Again, count the carbons as we explore t
