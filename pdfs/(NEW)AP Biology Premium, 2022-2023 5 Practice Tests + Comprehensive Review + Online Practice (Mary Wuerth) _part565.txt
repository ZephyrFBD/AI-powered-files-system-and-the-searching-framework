(b) Identify the independent variable and the dependent variable in this experiment.
(c) Analyze the data to determine the effect of the introduction of great blue herons on the population sizes of
the largemouth bass and the dace fish.

prediction.
Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (B) The most rapid population growth occurs during exponential growth, which is at point B. Choice (A) is
incorrect because it represents growth during the lag phase. At point C, the population is starting to decline in
numbers, so choice (C) is incorrect. Point D represents the carrying capacity, so choice (D) is also not the
answer.
2. (D) Point D represents the carrying capacity because the population size is stabilizing at point D. Point A
represents the lag phase, point B represents exponential growth, and point C represents a population that is
starting to decline, so choices (A), (B)
