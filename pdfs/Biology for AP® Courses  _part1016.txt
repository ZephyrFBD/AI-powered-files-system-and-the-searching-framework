urface receptors do
not have to enter the cell that they affect. Cell-surface receptors are also called cell-specific proteins or markers because
they are specific to individual cell types.
Because cell-surface receptor proteins are fundamental to normal cell functioning, it should come as no surprise that a
malfunction in any one of these proteins could have severe consequences. Errors in the protein structures of certain receptor
molecules have been shown to play a role in hypertension (high blood pressure), asthma, heart disease, and cancer.
Each cell-surface receptor has three main components: an external ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic membrane-
spanning region, and an intracellular domain inside the cell. The ligand-binding domain is also called the extracellular
domain. The size and extent of each of these domains vary widely, depending on the type of receptor.
