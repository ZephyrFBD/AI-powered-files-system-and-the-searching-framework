Analysis Question: What factors affect the rate of cellular respiration in multicellular organisms?
Exercise 6A:
 How Temperature Affects Oxygen Consumption
Interpretation of this Exercise
The above line graph demonstrates that increased temperature is proportional to increased oxygen
consumption. Be prepared to analyze data like that above and to compare the rates of cellular
respiration for multiple organisms on the same graph.
