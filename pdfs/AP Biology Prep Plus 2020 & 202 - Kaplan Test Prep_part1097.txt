vels of glucose be
expected to aﬀect protein X levels?
Protein X levels would decrease, because high glucose levels would
help the X operon repressor bind the X operon operator
(A)
Protein X levels would increase, because high levels of glucose
would decrease the amount of protein Y
(B)
Protein X levels would decrease, because high levels of glucose
would increase the amount of protein Y
(C)
Protein X levels would increase, because high levels of glucose
would provide enough energy for more transcription
