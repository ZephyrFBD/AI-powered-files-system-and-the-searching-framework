ition, which, in turn, promoted speciation.
Maintaining Reproductive Isolation
If species are not physically separated by a geographic barrier, various mechanisms exist to maintain reproductive
isolation and prevent gene flow. These mechanisms may appear randomly (genetic drift), occur from mutations, or
may be the result of natural selection.
There are two categories of isolating mechanisms. The first category, prezygotic isolating mechanisms, consists of
mechanisms that prevent fertilization:
1. Habitat isolation occurs when species do not encounter one another. 2. Temporal isolation occurs when species
mate or flower during different seasons or at different times of the day.
3. Behavioral isolation occurs when a species does not recognize another species as a mating partner because it
does not perform the correct courtship rituals, display the proper visual signals, sing the correct mating songs, or
release the proper chemicals (scents, or pheromones).
4. Mechanical isolation occurs
