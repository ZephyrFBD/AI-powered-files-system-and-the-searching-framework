d by the volume of the blood and the peripheral resistance of the blood vessels.
Blood volume is dependent upon hydration level and osmotic pressure within the blood. Peripheral resistance
refers to the volume of blood vessels, which is dependent upon constriction and dilation of arteries as blood
flow is maximized and minimized in response to the body’s needs.
Which of the following would BOTH help to raise blood pressure?
(A) Constriction of blood vessels and decreasing salt intake
(B) Dilation of blood vessels and decreasing salt intake
(C) Constriction of blood vessels and increasing salt intake
(D) Dilation of blood vessels and increasing salt intake
Questions 59–60 refer to the following passage.
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is broken down into oxygen and water by the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP).
This reaction can be measured with an oxygen-sensitive color indicator, and the color change can be measured on a
spectrophotometer. The rate of oxygen formation is measured with a c
