interbreed and are considered different species.
■Temporal isolation—Organisms can live in the same habitat, but if they are active at different times of the
day or have breeding seasons during different times of the year, they will be temporally isolated and will not
interbreed. Members of the cicada species Magicicada tredecim emerge to mate only once every 13 years,
while member of the cicada species Magicicada septendecim emerge to mate once every 17 years. The
mating cycles of these two species coincide only once every 221 years, which keeps them reproductively
isolated.
■Behavioral isolation—Some species will interbreed only with others who perform compatible mating
behaviors, such as mating calls or dances. Many bird species are reproductively isolated by their bird songs,
which attract members of the same species but not others. The blue-footed booby birds of the Galapagos
Islands will only mate with others that perform the correct mating dances.
■Mechanical isolation—If the se
