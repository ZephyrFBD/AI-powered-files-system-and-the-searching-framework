 in Table 3 and make the calculations. One map unit equals one percent 
recombination. The percent of asci showing recombination divided by 2 equals the 
map units separating the spore-color gene from the centromere. The percent of asci 
showing recombination is divided by 2 because only half of the spores in each ascus 
are the result of a crossing-over event.

â–  Evaluating Results 
1. Why did you divide the percentage of asci showing crossover (recombinant) by 2? 
2. The published map distance between the spore color gene and the centromere is 26 
map units. How did the class data compare with this distance? 
3. How can you account for any disparities between the class data and the p
