4. Many physiological activities in plants and animals oscillate
according to a circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is driven by
blue light receptors called cryptochromes. Cryptochromes consist
of a protein attached to a pigment. The DNA sequences of the
cryptochrome protein show extensive similarities among plants
and animals. A search of genome databanks reveals that the
cryptochromes share considerable sequence similarities with
photolyases, which repair enzymes that repair UV radiation
damage in DNA.
Which of the following conclusions is most justified based on
these findings?
The light receptor proteins are not homologous; they
appeared independently in diï¬€erent lineages because of the
selective pressure for all organisms to respond to blue light.
(A)
The photolyases and cryptochromes are both receptors of
blue light; therefore, their genes should share s
