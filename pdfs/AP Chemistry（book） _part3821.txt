 and 9% 
heptane, for instance, is rated as 91 octane.
The gasoline obtained by fractionating petroleum (called 
straight-run gasoline) contains mainly straight-chain hydrocarbons 
and has an octane number around 50. To increase its octane rating, it 
is subjected to a process called reforming, which converts the straight-
chain alkanes into branched-chain ones.
Cracking is used to produce aromatic hydrocarbons and to con-
vert some of the less volatile fractions of petroleum into compounds 
suitable for use as automobile fuel. In cracking, the hydrocarbons are 
mixed with a catalyst and heated to 4009500 Â°C. The catalysts used 
are either clay minerals or synthetic Al2O39SiO2 mixtures. In addi-
tion to forming molecules more suitable for gasoline, cracking results 
in the formation of such low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons as eth-
ylene and propene. These substances are used in a variety of reactions 
to form plastics and other chemicals.
Adding compounds called either antiknock agent
