, reflection of the wave from the
moving object is equivalent to the object reemitting the wave at the same 
frequency, and thus acting effectively as a moving source with speed
(Fig. 12–22b). The final frequency detected,
is given by
Eq. 12–2a.
SOLUTION The frequency 
that is “detected” by the moving object is
(Eq. 12–3a):
The moving object now “emits” (reflects) a sound of frequency (Eq. 12–2a)
Thus the frequency shifts by 103 Hz.
NOTE Bats use this technique to be aware of their surroundings. This is also the
principle behind Doppler radar as speed-measuring devices for vehicles, baseball
pitches, tennis serves, storms such as tornadoes, and other objects.
