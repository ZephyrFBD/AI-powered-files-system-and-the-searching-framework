ferent traits in offspring from different crosses. To find the probability of two
or more independent events (events where the outcome of one event has no influence on the outcome of the other event)
occurring together, apply the product rule and multiply the probabilities of the individual events. To find the probability that
one of two or more events occur, apply the sum rule and add their probabilities together.
The content presented in this section supports the learning objectives outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP速 Biology Curriculum
Framework. The AP速 learning objectives merge essential knowledge content with one or more of the seven science
practices. These objectives provide a transparent foundation for the AP速 Biology course, along with inquiry-based
laboratory experiences, instructional activities, and AP速 exam questions.
