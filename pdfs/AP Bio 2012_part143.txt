)
This option is correct. Both Plates I and III had extensive E. coli growth, 
showing that the cells were viable before and after the transformation 
procedure. 
(B)
This option is incorrect. Plates I and III would not have provided information on 
whether the plasmid could lose its ampr gene, and there was no way of knowing 
this with the data from these two plates.
(C)
This option is incorrect. The bacteria in Plate I were not exposed to the plasmid.
(D)
This option is incorrect. The bacteria were plated after the transformation; thus, 
plating could not have prepared them for transformation.
