†Pluto, since its discovery in 1930, was
considered a ninth planet. But its small mass
and the recent discovery of other objects
beyond Neptune with similar masses has led 
to calling these smaller objects, including Pluto,
“dwarf planets.” We keep it in the Table to
indicate its great distance, and its consistency
with Kepler’s third law.
