CHAPTER SUMMARY
13.1 Chromosomal Theory and Genetic Linkages
The Chromosomal Theory of inheritance, proposed by Sutton and Boveri, states that chromosomes are the vehicles of
genetic heredity. Neither Mendelian genetics nor gene linkage is perfectly accurate; instead, chromosome behavior
involves segregation, independent assortment, and occasionally, linkage. Sturtevant devised a method to assess
recombination frequency and infer the relative positions and distances of linked genes on a chromosome on the basis of
the average number of crossovers in the intervening region between the genes. Sturtevant correctly presumed that genes
are arranged in serial order on chromosomes and that recombination between homologs can occur anywhere on a
