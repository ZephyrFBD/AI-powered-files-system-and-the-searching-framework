b similar to that described in the AP Biology lab manual.
a. hypothesis statement (2 points maximum)
1 pt: Energy is obtained from aerobic respiration (or Kreb’s cycle).
1 pt: Energy is obtained from the breakdown of carbohydrates (or
glucose, C6H12O6).
1 pt: Equation and associated explanation: C6H12O6 + O2 → H2O +
CO2 + energy (or ATP).
1 pt: Glucose (C6H12O6), or starch, is stored in endosperm or
cotyledons.
 
b. description of experiment (4 points maximum)
 
1 pt: The independent variable is time.
 
1 pt: The dependent variable is O2 uptake. (Alternately, for the hypothesis given previously, CO2 release could be
the dependent
variable. Other dependent variables are possible depending on your hypothesis.)
1 pt for each of the following three items (2 points maximum):
There are three treatments of the dependent variable:
1. Live seeds (peas, for example), soaked and beginning to germinate. 2. Dry (unsoaked) live seeds (or boiled seeds,
or otherwise dead seeds).
3. Beads or other inan
