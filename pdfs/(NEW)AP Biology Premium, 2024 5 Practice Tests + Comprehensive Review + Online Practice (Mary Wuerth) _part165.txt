sugar content than the beets, the water potential
of the turnip cells would be higher than the water potential of the beet cells. So the turnips would gain less
water from the surrounding 0.35 molar sucrose solution than the beets did (less than 21.5%).

Overview
Living cells are complex chemical factories that carry out the chemical reactions necessary to support life. These
chemical reactions proceed at the rates required to support life because of the catalytic action of enzymes. This
chapter will review the structure and function of enzymes and how environmental factors influence the rate of
enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions.
Enzyme Structure and Function
Many of the chemical reactions needed to support living systems happen to
