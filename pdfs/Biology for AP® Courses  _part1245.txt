methods of reproduction do not require another organism of the opposite sex. Indeed, some organisms that lead a solitary
lifestyle have retained the ability to reproduce asexually. In addition, in asexual populations, every individual is capable
of reproduction. In sexual populations, the males are not producing the offspring themselves, so in theory an asexual
population could grow twice as fast.
However, multicellular organisms that exclusively depend on asexual reproduction are exceedingly rare. Why is sexuality
(and meiosis) so common? This is one of the important unanswered questions in biology and has been the focus of much
research beginning in the latter half of the twentieth century. There are several possible explanations, one of which is that
the variation that sexual reproduction creates among offspring is very important to the survival and reproduction of the
population. Thus, on average, a sexually reproducing population will leave more descendants than an other
