of characteristics of the diploid and
haploid generations, making it correct.

(A) is incorrect because tissues are composed of cells. In C, biosphere should follow
ecosystem, because it encompasses all other levels. (D) shows tissues being made up of
organisms, but the opposite is true. Only (B) shows a correct order of hierarchy: cells
make up tissues, which make up organs, which in turn make up organisms.
39. D
In a dihybrid cross such as the one described in the question, the expected phenotypic
outcome is: 9/16 individuals will show both dominant traits, 3/16 will show one
dominant and one recessive trait, 3/16 will show the other dominant and the other
recessive trait, and 1/16 will show both recessive traits. The question asks about
individuals showing one dominant and one recessive trait, so out of 160 oï¬€spring, 30
would be expected to fit the bill, (D).

The second law of thermodynamics maintains that every change in energy or energy
transfer contributes to the entro
