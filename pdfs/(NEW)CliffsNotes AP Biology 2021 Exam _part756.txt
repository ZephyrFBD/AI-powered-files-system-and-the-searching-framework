To confirm your placement of the fossil organism on the tree, you access BLAST, an online bioinformatics program,
to analyze DNA obtained from tissue surviving in the fossil. You are provided with several gene sequences from the
fossil (which you download from an AP Biology website) that you submit to BLAST. BLAST then compares your
gene sequences with others in the database and provides a list of organisms with gene sequences that are most
similar to the fossil sequence. A typical BLAST output appears in Figure 17-5.
The top section of a BLAST report provides a graphical summary of the results. Note the following information (the
numbered items below correspond to the numeric callouts in Figure 17-5):
1. Color Key. The color key (shown in the figure as shades of gray) is a legend defining the color of each of the
horizontal bars below. The bars represent alignment sequences of other organisms. The number on e
