o seamlessly. It appears
that the enzyme has to change its shape slightly to accommodate the shape of the substrates. This is called induced-
fit. Sometimes certain factors are involved in activating the enzyme and making it capable of binding the substrate.
Because the fit between the enzyme and the substrate must be perfect, enzymes operate only under a strict set of
biological conditions.
Enzymes Donâ€™t Always Work Alone
Enzymes sometimes need a little help in catalyzing a reaction. Those factors are known as cofactors. Cofactors can
be either organic molecules called coenzymes or inorganic molecules or ions. Inorganic cofactors are usually metal
ions (Fe2+, Mg2+). Vitamins are examples of organic coenzymes. Your daily dose of vitamins is important for just
this reason: vitamins are active and necessary participants in crucial chemical reactions.
Factors Affecting Reaction Rates
Enzymatic reactions can be influenced by a number of factors, such as temperature and pH. The concentratio
