itor of Example 17–9 is charged (to Q)
and then disconnected from the battery. Next a dielectric is inserted between the
plates. Will Q, C, or V change?
RESPONSE The charge Q remains the same—the capacitor is isolated, so there
is nowhere for the charge to go. The capacitance increases as a result of inserting
the dielectric (Eq. 17–9). The voltage across the capacitor also changes—it
decreases because, by Eq. 17–7,
so
if Q stays constant 
and C increases (it is in the denominator), then V decreases.
V = QC;
Q = CV,

Molecular Description of Dielectrics
Let us examine, from the molecular point of view, why the capacitance of a
capacitor should be l
