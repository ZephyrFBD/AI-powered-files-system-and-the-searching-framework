decay to 0.75 mg if it has a half-life of 27.8 days?
 [21.39]  Radium-226, which undergoes alpha decay, has a half-life 
of 1600 yr. (a) How many alpha particles are emitted in 5.0 
min by a 10.0-mg sample of 226Ra? (b) What is the activity 
of the sample in mCi?
 21.40  Cobalt-60, which undergoes beta decay, has a half-life of 
5.26 yr. (a) How many beta particles are emitted in 600 s 
by a 3.75-mg sample of 60Co? (b) What is the activity of the 
sample in Bq?
 21.41  The cloth shroud from around a mummy is found to have 
a 14C activity of 9.7 disintegrations per minute per gram of 
carbon as compared with living organisms that undergo 
16.3 disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon. From 
the half-life for 14C decay, 5715 yr, calculate the age of the 
shroud.
 21.42  A wooden artifact from a Chinese temple has a 14C activ-
ity of 38.0 counts per minute as compared with an activity 
of 58.2 counts per minute for a standard of zero age. From 
the half-life for 14C d
