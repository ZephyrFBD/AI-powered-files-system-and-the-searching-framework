rature to be 27 °C, 
being uncertain of the second digit of our measurement. By uncertain we mean that the 
temperature is reliably 27 °C and not 28 °C or 26 °C, but we can’t say that it is exactly 27 °C.
All digits of a measured quantity, including the uncertain one, are called signifi-
cant figures. A measured mass reported as 2.2 g has two significant figures, whereas 
one reported as 2.2405 g has five significant figures. The greater the number of signifi-
cant figures, the greater the precision implied for the measurement.

CHAPTER 1 Introduction: Matter, Energy, and Measurement
A problem arises when a number ends with zeros but contains no decimal point. 
In such cases, it is normally assumed that the zeros are not significant. Exponential 
notation (Appendix A.1) can be used to indicate whether end
