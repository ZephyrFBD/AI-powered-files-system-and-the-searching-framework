living cells. ATP is made up of a nucleotide, a five-carbon sugar, and
three phosphate groups. The bonds that connect the phosphates (phosphoanhydride bonds) have high-energy content. The
energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP into ADP + Pi is used to perform cellular work. Cells use ATP to perform
work by coupling the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis with endergonic reactions. ATP donates its phosphate group to
another molecule via a process known as phosphorylation. The phosphorylated molecule is at a higher-energy state and is
less stable than its unphosphorylated form, and this added energy from the addition of the phosphate allows the molecule
to undergo its endergonic reaction.
6.5 Enzymes
Enzymes are chemical catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions at physiological temperatures by lowering their
activation energy. Enzymes are usually proteins consisting of one or more polypeptide chains. Enzymes have an active site
that provides a unique chemical environment, made u
