le in nitrogen fixation. Cyanobacteria are able to use inorganic
sources of nitrogen to “fix” nitrogen. Rhizobium bacteria live symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas,
beans, and peanuts) and provide them with the organic nitrogen they need. Free-living bacteria, such as Azotobacter, are
also important nitrogen fixers.
Organic nitrogen is especially important to the study of ecosystem dynamics since many ecosystem processes, such as
primary production and decomposition, are limited by the available supply of nitrogen. As shown in Figure 37.18, the
nitrogen that enters living systems by nitrogen fixation is successively converted from organic nitrogen back into nitrogen
gas by bacteria. This process occurs in three steps in terrestrial systems: ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification.
First, the ammonification process converts nitrogenous waste from living animals or from the remains of dead animals
into ammonium (NH4+) by certain bacteria and fungi. Secon
