me genetically engineered crops there is uncertain consequences, should the transgenic gene, through gene flow
via pollen, spread to wild plant populations.
Genetic engineering in animals. Genes have been inserted into domestic animals to produce desirable products or
to produce animals that are more vigorous or convenient to rear. Salmon have been modified with a growth hormone
gene (from a different salmon species) to make them grow faster. Like plants, a major concern for the transgenic
salmon is gene flow into wild populations. Goats have been genetically modified to produce milk that contains
spider fibers (for use as sutures or industrial products). Predictably, there are often unexpected results with
genetically modified organisms (GMOs). A GM breed of featherless chickens, developed to simplify marketing
preparation, was more prone to insect bites and more sensitive to UV radiation. Also, mating success was impaired
because courtship requires feather displays.
