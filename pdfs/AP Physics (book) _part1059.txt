Above a certain speed, the flow becomes turbulent. Turbulent flow is characterized
by erratic, small, whirlpool-like circles called eddy currents or eddies (Fig. 10–18b).
Eddies absorb a great deal of energy, and although a certain amount of internal
friction called viscosity is present even during streamline flow, it is much greater
when the flow is turbulent. A few tiny drops of ink or food coloring dropped into a
moving liquid can quickly reveal whether the flow is streamline or turbulent.
Let us consider the steady laminar flow of a fluid through an enclosed tube
or pipe as shown in Fig. 10–19. First we determine how the speed of the fluid
changes when the diameter of the tube changes. The mass flow rate is defined as the
mass 
of fluid that passes a given point per unit time 
In Fig. 10–19, the volume of fluid passing point 1 (through area 
) in a time 
is 
where 
is the distance the fluid moves in time 
The velocity† of fluid
(density 
) passing point 1 is
