 the corresponding alkane from -ane to -ene. The compound on the left in Figure 24.7, 
for example, has a double bond as part of a three-carbon chain; thus, the parent alkene 
is propene.
The location of the double bond along an alkene chain is indicated by a prefix num-
ber that designates the double-bond carbon atom that is nearest an end of the chain. The 
chain is always numbered from the end that brings us to the double bond sooner and 
hence gives the smallest-numbered prefix. In propene, the only possible location for the 
double bond is between the first and second carbons; thus, a prefix indicating its loca-
tion is unnecessary. For butene (Figure 24.7), there are two possible positions for the dou-
ble bond, either after the first carbon (1-butene) or after the second carbon (2-butene).
