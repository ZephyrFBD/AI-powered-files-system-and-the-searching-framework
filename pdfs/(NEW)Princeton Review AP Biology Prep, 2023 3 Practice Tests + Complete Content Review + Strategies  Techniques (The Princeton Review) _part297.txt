alleles for other traits. For example, let’s look at two traits in pea plants: height and color. When it comes to
height, a pea plant can be either tall (T) or short (t). As for color, the plant can be either green (G) or yellow (g), with
green being dominant. Each gene comes in two alleles, so this gives us four alleles total. By the Law of Independent
Assortment, these four alleles can combine to give us four different gametes.
TG ​ Tg ​ tG ​ tg
In other words, each allele of the height gene can be paired with either allele of the color gene. The reason alleles
segregate independently is because chromosomes segregate independently. During meiosis I, each pair of
homologous chromosomes is split, and which one aligns left or right during metaphase I is different for each pair.
Dihybrid Cross
Now that we know that different genes assort independently into gametes, let’s look at a cross of two traits using
those four gametes that we created above. A dihybrid cross is just like the monohy
