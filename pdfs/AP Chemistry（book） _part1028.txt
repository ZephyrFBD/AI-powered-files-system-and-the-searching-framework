parts (a) and (b), which can we know with greater precision, 
the position of the electron or of the neutron?
Quantum Mechanics and Atomic Orbitals 
(Sections 6.5 and 6.6)
 6.53  Classify the following statements 
as either true or false: (a) In a con-
tour representation of an orbital, 
such as the one shown here for 
a 2p orbital, the electron is con-
fined to move about the nucleus 
on the outer surface of the shape. 
(b) The probability density [c(r)]2 
gives the probability of finding 
the electron at a specific distance 
from the nucleus.

 Classify the following statements as either true or false: (a) There 
are two maxima in this function because one electron spends 
most of its time at an approximate distance of 0.5 Å from the 
nucleus and the other electron spends most of its time at
