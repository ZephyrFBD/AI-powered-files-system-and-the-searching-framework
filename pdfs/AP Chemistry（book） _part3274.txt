 its use as a molten 
medium for electrolysis.
The electrolytic process used commercially to produce alu-
minum is the Hall–Héroult process, named after its inventors, 
Charles M. Hall and Paul Héroult. Hall (1863–1914) (Figure 20.31) 
began working on the problem of reducing aluminum in about 1885 
after he had learned from a professor of the difficulty of reducing ores 
of very active metals. Before the development of an electrolytic pro-
cess, aluminum was obtained by a chemical reduction using sodium 
or potassium as the reducing agent, a costly procedure that made alu-
minum metal expensive. As late as 1852, the cost of aluminum was 
$545 per pound, far greater than the cost of gold. During the Paris 
Exposition in 1855, aluminum was exhibited as a rare metal, even 
though it is the third most abundant element in Earth’s crust.
Hall, who was 21 years old when he began his research, utilized 
handmade and borrowed equipment in his studies and used a wood-
shed near his Ohio home as
