ed for naming ionic compounds:
How to Name Binary Molecular Compounds
 
1. The name of the element farther to the left in the periodic table (closest to the metals) is 
usually written first. An exception occurs when the compound contains oxygen and 
chlorine, bromine, or iodine (any halogen except fluorine), in which case oxygen is 
written last.
 
2. If both elements are in the same group, the one closer to the bottom of the table is named first.
 
3. The name of the second element is given an -ide ending.
 
4. Greek prefixes (Table 2.6) indicate the number of atoms of each element.  
(Exception: 
The prefix mono- is never used with the first element.) When the prefix ends in a or 
o and the name of the second element begins with a vowel, the a or o of the prefix is 
often dropped.
