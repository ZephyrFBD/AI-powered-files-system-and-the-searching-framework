crease.
(D) Solid water would be more dense than liquid water, so ice would no longer float.
Questions 18â€“21 refer to the following passage.
A chain of three small islands was found to be the home to a small species of mouse. The
angle of jaw opening was found to vary significantly. The average size angle of the maximal jaw
opening found in mice at 10 locations on the three small islands is shown in Figure 1, below.
Figure 1. Angles of maximal jaw opening (in degrees) for mice found at various island positions
18. Which of the following might account for the variations in maximal jaw angle?
(A) Different wind speeds on each island
(B) Different heights of trees on each island
(C) Different sizes of seeds on each island
(D) Differences in altitude on each island
19. If the mice from Island A and the mice from Island B were placed together, what would likely happen?
(A) The mice would mate, but it is impossible to predict jaw angle.
(B) The mice would mate, and the jaw angle would be app
