ccurs 
in steps, with HCO3
- forming ﬁrst and 
H2CO3 forming in appreciable amounts only 
when 3H+4 is sufficiently high.
(c) The solubility of BaF2 is enhanced by lower-
ing the pH because F- is a basic anion:
(d) The solubility of AgCl is unaffected by changes 
 
in pH because Cl- is the anion of a strong 
acid and therefore has negligible basicity.
Which of these substances are more soluble in acidic solution than in basic solution:
(a) Ni1OH221s2, (b) CaCO31s2, (c) BaF21s2, (d) AgCl1s2? 
Solve
(a) Ni1OH221s2 is more soluble in acidic solution 
because of the basicity of OH-; the H+ reacts 
with the OH- ion, forming water:
Analyze The problem lists four sparingly soluble salts, and we are 
asked to determine which are more soluble at low pH than at 
high pH.
Plan We will identify ionic compounds that dissociate to produce 
a basic anion, as these are especially soluble in acid solution.
Overall:
