rtilization. 
4. Prepare a video or write and produce a play about the process of chromosome 
movement. 
5. Investigate how growth factors affect the cell cycle. This will help you review cell 
communication. 
6. Research what tumor suppressors do in the cell cycle and which types of cancers 
may be caused by mutations in tumor suppressor genes. Specific examples include 
human papillomavirus (HPV), retinoblastoma protein (Rb), BRCA1 and BRCA2, 
and p53.

BIOTECHNOLOGY:  
BACTERIAL TRANSFORMATION*
How can we use genetic engineering techniques to  
manipulate heritable information?
 
â– BACKGROUND
Are genetically modified foods safe? There is ongoing debate about whether it is safe 
to eat fruit and vegetables that are genetically modified to contain toxins that ward off 
pests. For instance, biotechnologists have succeeded in inserting a gene (Bt) from the 
bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis into
