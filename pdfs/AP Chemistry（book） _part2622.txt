s why 3+ cations are much more acidic than cations with smaller charges.
The Lewis acid–base concept allows many ideas developed in this chapter to be used 
more broadly in chemistry, including rections in solvents other than water. If you take a 
course in organic chemistry, you will see a number of important rections that require the 
presence of a Lewis acid in order to proceed. The interaction of lone pairs on one mole-
cule or ion with vacant orbitals on another molecule or ion is one of the most important 
concepts in chemistry, as you will see throughout your studies.

Weak electrostatic interaction 
means small electron density 
shift to cation.
Strong electrostatic interaction 
means signiﬁcant electron 
density shift to cation.
Cation weakens H—O bond 
strength, solvating H2O can 
readily donate H1, solution 
becomes acidic.
Cation has little effect on 
H—O bond strength, solution 
remains neutral.
