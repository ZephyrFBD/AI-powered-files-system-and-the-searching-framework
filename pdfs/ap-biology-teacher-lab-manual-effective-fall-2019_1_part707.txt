pressure, and the physical and chemical properties of water. Transpiration creates a lower 
osmotic potential in the leaf, and the TACT (transpiration, adhesion, cohesion, and 
tension) mechanism describes the forces that move water and dissolved nutrients up the 
xylem.

Figure 1. Transpiration Model 
During transpiration, water evaporating from the spaces within leaves escapes through 
small pores called stomata. Although evaporation of water through open stomata is a 
major route of water loss in plants, the stomata must open to allow for the entry of CO2
O2 produced in photosynthesis exits through open 
stomata. Consequently, a balance must be maintained between the transport of CO2 and 
O2 and the loss of water. Specialized cells called guard cells help r
