 it does not get the
appropriate signal, the cell will exit the cycle and become a nondividing
cell arrested in the G0 (G zero) phase. Since the activity of a cell varies,
the rate at which it needs to divide also varies. The timing of the cell cycle
is initiated by growth factors, like PDGF, and controlled by two kinds of
molecules: cyclins and protein kinases.
STUDY TIP
This is a great example of cell signaling.
Cyclins are proteins that get their name because their levels cyclically
rise and fall in dividing cells. They are synthesized during every S and G2
phase, and broken down after every M phase. Kinases are a ubiquitous
class of proteins that activate other proteins by phosphorylating them. The
kinases critical to the cell cycle are activated only when they bind to a
cyclin. Hence, they are aptly named cyclin-dependent kinases or Cdks.
When a Cdk binds to a cyclin, a cyclin-Cdk complex is formed. One
particular cyclin-Cdk complex, MPF, triggers the cellâ€™s passage from G2
to mit
