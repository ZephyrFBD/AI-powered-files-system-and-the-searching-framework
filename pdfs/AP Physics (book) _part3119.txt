Chapter 22. That is,
where E is the electric field strength. From the particle point of view, the intensity
of a light beam (of given frequency) is proportional to the number of photons, N,
that pass through a given area per unit time. The more photons there are, the
greater the intensity. Thus
This proportion can be turned around so that we have
That is, the number of photons (striking a page of this book, say) is proportional
to the square of the electric field strength.
If the light beam is very weak, only a few photons will be involved. Indeed, it
is possible to “build up” a photograph in a camera using very weak light so the
effect of photons arriving can be seen. If we are dealing with only one photon,
the relationship above 
can be interpreted in a slightly different way. At
any point, the square of the electric field strength 
is a measure of the probability
that a photon will be at that location. At points where 
is large, there is a high
probability the photon will be there
