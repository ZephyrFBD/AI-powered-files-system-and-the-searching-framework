(c) It increases.
(d) There is no potential energy in this situation.
W
e saw in Chapter 6 that the concept of energy was extremely valuable
in dealing with the subject of mechanics. For one thing, energy is a
conserved quantity and is thus an important tool for understanding
nature. Furthermore, we saw that many Problems could be solved using the
energy concept even though a detailed knowledge of the forces involved was not
possible, or when a calculation involving Newton’s laws would have been too
difficult.
The energy point of view can be used in electricity, and it is especially useful.
It not only extends the law of conservation of energy, but it gives us another way
to view ele
