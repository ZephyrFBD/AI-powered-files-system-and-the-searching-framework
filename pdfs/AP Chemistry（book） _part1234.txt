nd relative sizes of the 
ions in the compounds. We then use Equation 8.4 qualitatively 
to determine the relative energies, knowing that (a) the larger the 
ionic charges, the greater the energy and (b) the farther apart the 
ions are, the lower the energy.
Solve NaF consists of Na+ and F- ions, CsI of Cs+ and I- ions, and 
CaO of Ca2+ and O2- ions. Because the product Q 1Q 2 appears in 
the numerator of Equation 8.4, the lattice energy increases dra-
matically when the charges increase. Thus, we expect the lattice 
energy of CaO, which has 2+ and 2- ions, to be the greatest of the 
three.
The ionic charges are the same in NaF and CsI. The difference in 
their lattice energies thus depends on the difference in the dis-
tance between ions in the lattice. Because ionic size increases as we 
go down a group in the periodic table 
 (Section 7.3), we know 
that Cs+ is larger than Na+ and I- is larger than F -. Therefore, the 
distance between Na+ and F - ions in NaF is less than the distan
