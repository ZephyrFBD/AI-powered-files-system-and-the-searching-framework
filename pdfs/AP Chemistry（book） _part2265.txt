+ O1g2
Omitting the intermediate, O(g), which occurs on both sides 
of the equation, gives the overall reaction:
2 N2O1g2 ¡ 2 N21g2 + O21g2
(b) The rate law for the overall reaction is just the rate law for the 
slow, rate-determining elementary reaction. Because that slow 
step is a unimolecular elementary reaction, the rate law is ﬁrst 
order:
Rate = k3N2O4
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
An alternative two-step reaction mechanism has been proposed 
for the reaction NO21g2 + CO1g2 ¡ NO1g2 + CO21g2, 
which was discussed on page 597:
Step 1:
 NO21g2 + NO21g2 ¡ N2O41g2   1slow2
Step 2:
N2O41g2 + CO1g2 ¡ NO1g2 + CO21g2 + NO21g2 1fast2
Which experiment would allow you to distinguish between 
the two proposed mechanisms?  
(a) Run trials with different initial concentrations of NO2(g)  
and measure the initial reaction rates. (b) Run trials with 
different initial concentrations of CO(g) and measure the 
initial reaction rates. (c) Conduct experiments to identify 
the reaction intermediate(s). (d)
