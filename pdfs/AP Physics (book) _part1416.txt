the pressure P of
the air inside the jar can increase enough to cause the jar to explode, throwing
glass pieces outward.

FIGURE 13–16 Blowing up a
balloon means putting more air
(more air molecules) into the
balloon, which increases its volume.
The pressure is nearly constant, at
atmospheric pressure, except for the
small effect of the balloon’s elasticity.
13–6 The Ideal Gas Law
The gas laws of Boyle, Charles, and Gay-Lussac were obtained by means of an
important scientific technique: namely, considering one quantity and how it is
affected by changing only one other variable, keeping all other variables constant.
These laws can now be combined into a single more general relation among all
three variables—absolute pressure, volume, and absolute temperature of a fixed
amount of gas:
This relation indicates how any of the quantities P, V, or T will vary when the
other two quantities change. This relation reduces to Boyle’s, Charl
