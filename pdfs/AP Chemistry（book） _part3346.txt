*As noted in Section 2.3, we often do not explicitly write the atomic number of an isotope be-
cause the element symbol is specific to the atomic number. In studying nuclear chemistry, how-
ever, it is often useful to include the atomic number in order to help us keep track of changes in 
the nuclei.
 
SECTION 21.1   
Radioactivity and Nuclear Equations 
903
In Equation 21.1 the sum of the mass numbers is the same on both sides of the equa-
tion 1238 = 234 + 42. Likewise, the sum of the atomic numbers on both sides of the 
equation is equal 192 = 90 + 22. Mass numbers and atomic numbers must be balanced 
in all nuclear equations.
The radioactive properties of the nucleus in an atom are independent of the chemi-
cal state of the atom. In writing nuclear equations, therefore, we are not concerned with 
the chemical form (element or compound) of the atom in which the nucleus resides.
