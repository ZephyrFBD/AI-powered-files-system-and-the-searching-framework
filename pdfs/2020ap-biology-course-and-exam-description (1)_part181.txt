Genetic information in retroviruses is a special 
case and has an alternate flow of information: 
from RNA to DNA, made possible by reverse 
transcriptase, an enzyme that copies the 
viral RNA genome into DNA. This DNA 
integrates into the host genome and becomes 
transcribed and translated for the assembly of 
new viral progeny.

EXCLUSION STATEMENT—The names of the 
steps and particular enzymes involved—beyond 
DNA polymerase, ligase, RNA polymerase, 
helicase, and topoisomerase—are beyond the 
scope of the course and the AP Exam.
