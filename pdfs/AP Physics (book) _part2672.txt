 narrow slit S in the “collimator.”
The slit is at the focal point of the lens L, so parallel light falls on the grating. The
movable telescope can bring the rays to a focus. Nothing will be seen in the viewing
telescope unless it is positioned at an angle that corresponds to a diffraction peak
(first order is usually used) of a wavelength emitted by the source. The angle can be
measured to very high accuracy, so the wavelength can be determined to high accuracy
using Eq. 24–4:
where m is an integer representing the order, and d is the distance between grating
slits. The bright line you see in a spectrometer corresponding to a discrete particular
wavelength is actually an image of the slit S.A narrower slit results in dimmer light, but
we can measure the angular position more precisely. If the light contains a continu-
ous range of wavelengths, then a continuous spectrum is seen in the spectroscope.
The spectrometer in Fig. 24–27 uses a transmission grating. Others may use a
reflection
