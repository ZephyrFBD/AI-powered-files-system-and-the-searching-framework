 for 24 hours. After 24 hours, I
would weigh them all again and determine the percent change
in mass for each. Any percent decrease in mass would be due to
water loss by transpiration.
If the mass of the plant after 24 hours was less than it was at
time zero, the plant lost mass due to transpiration. The greater
the percent loss of mass, the faster was the rate of transpiration.
Similarly, the less the percent loss of mass, the slower was the
rate of transpiration.
I predict that Plant I will have lost some mass because it
transpired normally over the 24-hour period. I predict that Plant
II will have lost less mass than Plant I lost because the baggie
over the leaves will have kept the humidity high around the
leaves of the plant, which slowed down the rate of
transpiration. I predict that Plant III will have lost the most

mass because the fan will have blown the humidity away from
the plant, thus increasing the rate of transp
