 comes into the system from the stove, and water is released 
to the surroundings as steam. 
The systems we can most readily study in thermochemistry are called closed 
 
systems—systems that can exchange energy but not matter with their surroundings. For 
example, consider a mixture of hydrogen gas, H2, and oxygen gas, O2, in a cylinder fit-
ted with a piston (Figure 5.4). The system is just the hydrogen and oxygen; the cylinder, 
 
piston, and everything beyond them (including us) are the surroundings. If the gases 
react to form water, energy is liberated:
2 H21g2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 H2O1g2 + energy
Although the chemical form of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the system is 
changed by this reaction, the system has not lost or gained mass, which means it has not 
 
exchanged any matter with its surroundings. However, it can exchange energy with its 
surroundings in the form of work and heat.
An isolated system is one in which neither energy nor matter can be exchanged with 
the surrounding
