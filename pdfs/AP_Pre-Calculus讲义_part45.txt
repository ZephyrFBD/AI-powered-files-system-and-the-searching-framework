aph of y = f(x) vertically by a factor of c. 
If 0 < c < I. shrink the graph of y = f(x) vertically by a factor of c. 
 
 
Example 4

1.10.5 Horizontal Stretching and Shrinking 
To graph y = f(cx): 
If c > 1, shrink the graph of y = f(x) horizontally by a factor of 1/c. 
If 0 < c < 1, stretch the graph of y = f(x) horizontally by a factor of 1/c. 
 
 
Example 5 
The graph of y = f (x) is shown below. Sketch the graph of each function.

1.10.6 Even and Odd Functions 
Let f be a function. 
f is even if f(−x) = f(x) for all x in the domain of f.  
f is odd if f(−x) = −f(x) for all x in the domain of f. 
 
 
Example 6 
Determine whether the functions are even, odd, or neither even nor odd.
