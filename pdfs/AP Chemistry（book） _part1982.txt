 12.24  Imagine the primitive cubic lattice. Now imagine grabbing 
opposite corners and stretching it along the body diagonal 
while keeping the edge lengths equal. The three angles be-
tween the lattice vectors remain equal but are no longer 90°. 
What kind of primitive lattice have you made?
 12.25  Which of the three-dimensional primitive lattices has 
a unit cell where none of the internal angles is 90°? 
(a) Orthorhombic, (b) hexagonal, (c) rhombohedral, 
 
(d) triclinic, (e) both rhombohedral and triclinic.
 12.26  Besides the cubic unit cell, which other unit cell(s) has edge 
lengths that are all equal to each other? (a) Orthorhom-
bic, (b) hexagonal, (c) rhombohedral, (d) triclinic, (e) both 
rhombohedral and triclinic.
 12.27  What is the minimum number of atoms that could be con-
tained in the unit cell
