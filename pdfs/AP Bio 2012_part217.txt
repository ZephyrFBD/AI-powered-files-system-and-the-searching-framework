ch correct explanation of the pattern or relationship 
between the environmental factor and the biological system.
Possible explanations include the following:
• 
Recognition of exponential growth due to lack of limiting factors; 
reproductive/growth rate far exceeds death rate.
• 
Slowing of reproductive/growth rate due to the influence of density-
dependent limiting factors.
• 
Death rate beginning to approach reproductive/growth rate in transition 
from period 1 to period 2.
• 
Accumulation of toxic wastes increases death rate and decreases 
reproductive rate.
• 
Population at carrying capacity stabilizes as the reproductive rate equals  
the death rate.
