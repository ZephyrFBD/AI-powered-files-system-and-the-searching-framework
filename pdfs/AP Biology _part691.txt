Figure 16.2 How Polypeptide Hormones Trigger a Response in a Cell
You may wish to refer back to Chapter 3, “The Cell,” for the basics about
how hormones influence cells.
Details of How Two Hormones Function
TESTOSTERONE
Testosterone is a good example of how a steroid hormone functions.
Testosterone is secreted by cells in the testes and travels through the blood,
entering cells all over the body. It readily passes through the cell
membrane and binds to a receptor in the cytoplasm, activating it. Only
cells with testosterone receptors can respond to testosterone. With the
hormone attached, the activated receptor enters the nucleus and acts as a
transcription factor, turning on specific genes in the nucleus that control
male characteristics. However, different genes are turned on in different
cells. In muscle cells, the g
