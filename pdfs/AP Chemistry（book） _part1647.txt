 experience attractive forces for one another. These two ef-
fects make the volumes of real gases larger and their pressures smaller 
than those of an ideal gas. The van der Waals equation is an equation of 
state for gases, which modifies the ideal-gas equation to account for 
intrinsic molecular volume and intermolecular forces.
