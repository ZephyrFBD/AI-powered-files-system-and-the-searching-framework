Thus, the student received 1 point out of a possible 2 points
total for part (c).
The student received points for correctly stating the following:
The student correctly made a prediction about the results that
he or she would expect for the experiment designed in part
(b). The prediction was that the enzyme-controlled reaction
would be inhibited above approximately 38°C (body
temperature) and that the decrease in the rate of the reaction
would continue until the reaction ceased totally. (1 point)
The student also correctly justified his or her prediction. The
student correctly explained the cause of denaturation in an
enzyme (that heat breaks intramolecular bonds that give the
enzyme its specific shape and function). The student also
stated that denaturation inhibits an enzyme-controlled
reaction. (1 point)
