close to the value given in the problem statement, 3.9 * 10-11.
Comment Because F- is the anion of a weak acid, you might expect 
hydrolysis of the ion to affect the solubility of CaF2. The basicity 
of F- is so small 1Kb = 1.5 * 10-112, however, that the hydrolysis 
occurs to only a slight extent and does not significantly influence 
the solubility. The reported solubility is 0.017 g/L at 25 °C, in good 
agreement with our calculation.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Of the five salts listed below, which has the highest concen-
tration of its cation in water? Assume that all salt solutions 
are saturated and that the ions do not undergo any additional 
reactions in water.
(a) lead(II) chromate, Ksp = 2.8 * 10-13
(b) cobalt(II) hydroxide, Ksp = 1.3 * 10-15
(c) cobalt(II) sulfide, Ksp = 5 * 10-22
(d) chromium(III) hydroxide, Ksp = 1.6 * 10-30
(e) silver sulfide, Ksp = 6 * 10-51
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
The Ksp for LaF3 is 2 * 10-19. What is the solubility of LaF3 in 
water in moles per liter?
