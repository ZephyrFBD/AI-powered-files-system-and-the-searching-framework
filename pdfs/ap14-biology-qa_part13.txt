 was 1.37 out of a possible 4 points. 
What were common student errors or omissions?  
Many students were unable to appropriately analyze the data provided in the question. The graph showed 
the relationship between the mean number of spots per male guppy and time, but the y-axis units were 
misinterpreted by many students as the number of individuals instead of the mean number of spots. Other 
errors included confusing the lines representing the population in the absence of predators with the line 
representing the population in the presence of predators.  
Students struggled to correctly assess the variation in the number of spots over time and frequently 
responded that genetic variation of the population was increasing because the slope of the line is positive.  
Students made the assumption that the allele for spots was dominant because the mean number of spots 
increased, or that the male guppies have spots and the females do not. Students were unable to speak 
clearly about the
