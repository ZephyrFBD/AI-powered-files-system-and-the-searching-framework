cells to the point of infection. Which of the following statements explains the feedback loop that occurs and predicts
what would likely happen if the number of pathogens entering the body increases?
a.
This is positive feedback. Fewer white blood cells will be attracted to the site as the number of pathogens in
the body increases.
b.
This is negative feedback. Fewer white blood cells will be attracted to the site as the number of pathogens in
the body increases
c.
This is positive feedback. More white blood cells will be attracted to the site as the number of pathogens in
the body increases.
d.
This is negative feedback. More white blood cells will be attracted to the site as the number of pathogens in
the body increas
