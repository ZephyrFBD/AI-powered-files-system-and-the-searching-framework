g the apples till we can’t swallow another bit 
 
 and we stick our faces into a stream for the lovely cool water.Then we 
 
 run to opposite ends of a ditch to shit and wipe ourselves with grass and 
 
 thick leaves. Paddy is squatting and saying,There’s nothing in the world 
 
 like a good feed of apples, a drink of water and a good shit, better than 
 
 any sangwidge of cheese and mustard and Dotty O’Neill can shove his 
 
 apple up his arse. 
 
 There are three cows in a field with their heads over a stone wall 
 
  
  
 and they say moo to us. Paddy says, Bejasus, ’tis milkin’ time, and he’s 
 
 over the wall, stretched on his back under a cow with her big udder 
 
 hanging into his face.He pulls on a teat and squirts milk into his mouth. 
 
 He stops squirting and says, Come on, Frankie, fresh milk. ’Tis lovely. 
 
 Get that other cow, they’re all ready for the milkin’. 
 
 I get under the cow and pull on a teat but she kicks and moves and 
 
 I’m sure she’s going to kill me.Padd
