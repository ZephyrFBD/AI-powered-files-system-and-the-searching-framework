dies of
evolution in populations in the real word (in the “wild”) generally demonstrate that natural selection is the strongest
driving force for evolution.
Investigation 3: Comparing DNA Sequences
In this investigation, you use bioinformatics to establish evolutionary relationships. Bioinformatics is the computer
analysis of biological information, such as DNA or protein sequences, for understanding biological processes.
Part I: Using BLAST to Find Evolutionary Relationships
You begin this investigation by observing an image of a fossil obtained from an excavation in China. Using features
that you’ve detected in the image, you decide where on a provided cladogram the fossil organism should be
positioned. A cladogram (or phylogenetic tree) is a “tree-like” graphical representation of the relatedness of species.
Each branch of the phylogenetic tree represents the divergence of a species (or group of species) from a common
ancestor. Each branch may also show the shared derived character
