orizes names of new elements after their experimental discovery 
and confirmation. According to the IUPAC, new elements can be named after a myth-
ological concept, a mineral, a place or country, a property, or a scientist. In 2016, IUPAC 
approved the following names and symbols for elements 113, 115, 117, and 118, as sug-
gested by their discoverers: nihonium, Nh, for element 113; moscovium, Mc, for element 
115; tennessine, Ts, for element 117; and organesson, Og, for element 118.
21.4 âˆ£ Rates of Radioactive Decay
Some radioisotopes, such as uranium-238, are found in nature 
even though they are not stable. Other radioisotopes do not exist 
in nature but can be synthesized in nuclear reactions. To under-
stand this distinction, we must realize that different nuclei undergo 
radioactive decay at different rates. Many radioisotopes decay essen-
tially completely in fractions of a second, so we do not find them in 
nature. Uranium-238, on the other hand, decays very slowly. There-
