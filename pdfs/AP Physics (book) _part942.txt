 stimulation by a nerve, but a muscle cannot
exert a push. Muscles that tend to bring two limbs closer together, such as the
biceps muscle in the upper arm (Fig. 9–12), are called flexors; those that act to
extend a limb outward, such as the triceps muscle in Fig.9–12, are called extensors.
You use the flexor muscle in the upper arm when lifting an object in your hand;
you use the extensor muscle when throwing a ball.
Force exerted by biceps muscle. How much force must
the biceps muscle exert when a 5.0-kg ball is held in the hand (a) with the arm
horizontal as in Fig. 9–13a, and (b) when the arm is at a 45° angle as in Fig. 9–13b?
The biceps muscle is connected to the forearm by a tendon attached 5.0 cm from
the elbow joint. Assume that the mass of forearm and hand together is 2.0 kg
and their CG is as shown.
APPROACH The free-body diagram for the forearm is shown in Fig. 9–13; the
forces are the weights of the arm and ball, the upward force 
exerted by the
muscle, and a force
