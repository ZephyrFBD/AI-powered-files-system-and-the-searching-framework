peed of sound). Many animals can hear ultrasonic frequen-
cies; dogs, for example, can hear sounds as high as 50,000 Hz, and bats can detect
frequencies as high as 100,000 Hz. Ultrasonic waves have many useful applications
in medicine and other fields, which we will discuss later in this Chapter.

FIGURE 12–2 The membrane of a 
drum, as it vibrates, alternately 
compresses the air and, as it recedes 
(moves to the left), leaves a 
rarefaction or expansion of air. See 
also Fig. 11–26.
FIGURE 12–1 Example 12–2. Autofocusing camera emits an 
ultrasonic pulse. Solid lines represent the wave front of the 
outgoing wave pulse moving to the right; dashed lines represent 
the wave front of the pulse reflected off the person’s face,
returning to the
