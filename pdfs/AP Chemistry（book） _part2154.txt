 13.85  (a) Do colloids made only of gases exist? Why or why 
not? (b) In the 1850s, Michael Faraday prepared ruby-red 
colloids of gold nanoparticles in water that are still stable 
today. These brightly colored colloids look like solutions. 
What experiment(s) could you do to determine whether a 
given colored preparation is a solution or colloid?
 13.86  Choose the best answer: A colloidal dispersion of one liquid 
in another is called (a) a gel, (b) an emulsion, (c) a foam, 
 
(d) an aerosol.
 13.87  An “emulsifying agent” is a compound that helps stabi-
lize a hydrophobic colloid in a hydrophilic solvent (or 
a hydrophilic colloid in a hydrophobic solvent). Which 
of the following choices is the best emulsifying agent? 
(a) CH3COOH, (b) CH3CH2CH2COOH, (c) CH31CH2211
COOH, (d) CH31CH2211COONa.
 13.88  Aerosols are important components of the atmosphere. 
Does the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere increase or 
decrease the amount of sunlight that arrives at
