lenoid. One simple
use is as a doorbell (Fig. 20–29). When the circuit is closed by pushing the button,
the coil effectively becomes a magnet and exerts a force on the iron rod. The rod
is pulled into the coil and strikes the bell. A large solenoid is used for the starter
of a car: when you engage the starter, you are closing a circuit that not only turns
the starter motor, but first activates a solenoid that moves the starter into direct
contact with the gears on the engine’s flywheel. Solenoids are used a lot as switches
in cars and many other devices. They have the advantage of moving mechanical
parts quickly and accurately.
Magnetic Circuit Breakers
Modern circuit breakers that protect houses and buildings from overload and fire
contain not only a “thermal” part (bimetallic strip as described in Section 18–6,
Fig. 18–19) but also a magnetic sensor. If the current is above a certain level, the
magnetic field the current produces pulls an iron plate that breaks the same contact
point
