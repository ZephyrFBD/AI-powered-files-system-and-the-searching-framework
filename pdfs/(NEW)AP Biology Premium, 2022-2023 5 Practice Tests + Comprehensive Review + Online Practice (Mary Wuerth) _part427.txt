 DNA polymerase, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D)
is incorrect because heat-stable DNA polymerases are not more accurate than other DNA polymerases.

11. (a) Bacterial transformation through heat shock could be used to insert this plasmid into the cell. The transition
from cold-hot-cold will create temporary small pores through which the plasmids may enter the cell.
(b) Plating the transformed bacteria on an agar plate (that contains both ampicillin and kanamycin) would kill
any bacteria that did not absorb the pAMP-pKAN plasmid.
(c) If a bacterium absorbs the piece of DNA that has a cut in the kanamycin resistance gene, the bacterium
would still be resistant to ampicillin but not resistant to kanamycin.
(d) The ampicillin resistance gene would still be intact and functional, but the kanamycin resistance gene would
not be functional due to the cut made by the restriction enzyme.
12. (a) The phosphates in the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA have a slight negativ
