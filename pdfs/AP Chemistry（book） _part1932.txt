l polymers commonly consist of a collection of macromol-
ecules (large molecules) of different molecular weights. Depending on the conditions of 
formation, the molecular weights may be distributed over a wide range or may be closely 
clustered around an average value. In part because of this distribution in molecular 
weights, polymers are largely amorphous (noncrystalline) materials. Rather than exhib-
iting a well-defined crystalline phase with a sharp melting point, polymers soften over 
a range of temperatures. They may, however, possess short-range order in some regions 
of the solid, with chains lined up in regular arrays as shown in Figure 12.40. The extent 
of such ordering is indicated by the degree of crystallinity of the polymer. Mechan-
ical stretching or pulling to align the chains as the molten polymer is drawn through 
small holes can frequently enhance the crystallinity of a polymer. Intermolecular forces 
between the polymer chains hold the chains together in the orde
