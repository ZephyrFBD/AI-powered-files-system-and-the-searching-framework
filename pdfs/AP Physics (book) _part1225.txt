 a cord are
examples. The wave may be a pulse (a single crest), or it may
be continuous (many crests and troughs).
The wavelength of a continuous sinusoidal wave is the dis-
tance between two successive crests.
The frequency is the number of full wavelengths (or crests)
that pass a given point per unit time.
The amplitude of a wave is the maximum height of a crest,
or depth of a trough, relative to the normal (or equilibrium)
level.

1–15 Mathematical Representation
of a Traveling Wave
A simple wave with a single frequency, as in Fig. 11–47, is sinusoidal. To express
such a wave mathematically, we assume it has a particular wavelength 
and 
frequency f. At
the wave shape shown is
(11;21)
where y is the displacement of the wave (either longitudinal or transverse) 
at position x,
is the wavelength, and A is the amplitude of the wave.
[Equation 11–21 works because it repeats itself every wavelength: when
]
Suppose the wave is moving to the right with speed v. Aft
