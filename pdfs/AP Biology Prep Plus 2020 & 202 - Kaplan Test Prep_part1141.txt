During “crossing over” in prophase I of meiosis, sections of chromosomes
can be excised and recombined with other chromosomes. Typically, this is
a balanced exchange between homologous chromosomes; however,
sometimes whole fragments can break oﬀ and be added to the end of a
nonhomologous chromosome. This unbalanced exchange between
nonhomologous chromosomes is known as translocation and can result
in a trisomy or monosomy phenotype despite having a normal
chromosome number. In Down syndrome cases with a normal
chromosome number, the cause is what’s known as a Robertsonian
translocation, where the extra copy of chromosome 21 is translocated on
chromosome 14, thus (C) is correct. During embryogenesis, fetal cells
replicate by mitosis—eliminating (A)—and genetic recombination is not a
part of mitosis—eliminating (B). If the extra copy of chromosome 21 were
lost during spermatog
