Motion
When you throw a stone into a lake or pool of water, circular waves form and
move outward, Fig. 11–21. Waves will also travel along a rope that is stretched
out straight on a table if you vibrate one end back and forth as shown in 
Fig. 11–22. Water waves and waves on a rope or cord are two common examples
of mechanical waves, which propagate as oscillations of matter. We will discuss
other kinds of waves in later Chapters, including electromagnetic waves and light.
†Do not be confused by the “breaking” of ocean waves, which occurs when a wave interacts with the
ground in shallow water and hence is no longer a simple wave.
If you have ever watched ocean waves moving toward shore before they break,
you may have wondered if the waves were carrying water from far out at sea onto
the beach. They don’t.† Water waves move with a recognizable velocity. But each
particle (or molecule) of the water itself merely oscillates about an equilibrium
point. This is clearly demonstrated by obser
