hifted to pre-drought 
numbers because no longer was there selective pressure favoring larger  
beak sizes.
(C)
This option is incorrect. The data do not support this conclusion. Had drought 
conditions increased during the time interval (1988â€“1993), selected pressure 
would have favored finches with larger beaks to crack open thick-walled seeds.
(D)
This option is incorrect. The data do not support this conclusion. There is no 
evidence to support a correlation between finch beak size and predator behavior.
Question 11
Essential Knowledge
4.A.1: The subcomponents of biological molecules and 
their sequence determine the properties of that molecule. 
Science Practice
1.3: The student can refine representations and models  
of natural or man-made phenomena and systems in 
the domain.
Learning Objective 
4.2: The student is able to refine representations and 
models to explain how the subcomponents of a biological 
polymer and their sequence determine the properties of 
that polymer.
