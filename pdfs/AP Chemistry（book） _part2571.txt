r sulfuric acid is listed 
simply as “large.” Sulfuric acid is a strong acid with respect to the removal of the first pro-
ton. Thus, the reaction for the first ionization step lies completely to the right:
 
H2SO41aq2 ¡  H+1aq2 + HSO4
-1aq2 1complete ionization2 
However, HSO4
- is a weak acid for which Ka2 = 1.2 * 10-2.
For many polyprotic acids Ka1 is much larger than subsequent dissociation con-
stants, in which case the H+1aq2 in the solution comes almost entirely from the first 
ionization reaction. As long as successive Ka values differ by a factor of 103 or more, it is 
usually possible to obtain a satisfactory estimate of the pH of polyprotic acid solutions by 
treating the acids as if they were monoprotic, considering only Ka1.
