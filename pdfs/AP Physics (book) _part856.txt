 The plate started from rest so the torque, assumed constant, was
(c) Initially, before contact,
is rotating at constant 
(we ignore friction). When
plate B comes in contact, why is their joint rotation speed less? You might think in
terms of the torque each exerts on the other upon contact. But quantitatively,
it’s easier to use conservation of angular momentum, Eq. 8–20, since no external
torques are assumed to act. Thus
Solving for
