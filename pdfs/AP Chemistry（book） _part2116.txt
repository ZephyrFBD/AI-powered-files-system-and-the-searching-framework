in tropical climates rife with malaria, those 
with sickle-cell genes have lower incidence of this debilitating disease.

CHAPTER 13 Properties of Solutions
A 0.100-L solution is made by dissolving 0.441 g of CaCl21s2 in water. (a) Calculate the osmotic pressure of this solution at 
27 °C, assuming that it is completely dissociated into its component ions. (b) The measured osmotic pressure of this solution is 
2.56 atm at 27 °C. Explain why it is less than the value calculated in (a), and calculate the van’t Hoff factor, i, for the solute in 
this solution. (c) The en
