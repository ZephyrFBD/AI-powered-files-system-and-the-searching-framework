 just by
listening to the difference in pitch of the engine noise
between approaching and receding cars. Suppose the sound
of a certain car drops by a full octave (frequency halved) as
it goes by on the straightaway. How fast is it going?
3. A person hears a pure tone in the 500 to 1000-Hz range
coming from two sources. The sound is loudest at points
equidistant from the two sources. To determine exactly what
the frequency is, the person moves about and finds that the
sound level is minimal at a point 0.25 m farther from one
source than the other. What is the frequency of the sound?
1.0-cm3
343 ms.
4. A factory whistle emits sound of frequency 770 Hz. The
wind velocity is 
from the north (heading south).
What frequency will observers hear who are located, at rest,
(a) due north, (b) due south, (c) due east, and (d) due west,
of the whistle? What frequency is heard by a cyclist heading
(e) north or (f) west, toward the whistle at
