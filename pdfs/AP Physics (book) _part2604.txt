urvature of
the mirror.
14. (II) The image of a distant tree is virtual and very small
when viewed in a curved mirror. The image appears to be
19.0 cm behind the mirror. What kind of mirror is it, and
what is its radius of curvature?
15. (II) A mirror at an amusement park shows an upright
image of any person who stands 1.9 m in front of it. If the
image is three times the person’s height, what is the radius
of curvature of the mirror? (See Fig. 23–50.)
16. (II) In Example 23–4, show that if the object is moved 10.0 cm
farther from the concave mirror, the object’s image size
will equal the object’s actual size. Stated as a multiple of the
focal length, what is the object distance for this “actual-sized
image” situation?
17. (II) You look at yourself in a shiny 8.8-cm-diameter Christ-
mas tree ball. If your face is 25.0 cm away from the ball’s
front surface, where is your image? Is it real or virtual? Is
it upright or inverted?
18. (II) Some rearview mirrors produce images of cars to you
