ored under the new circumstances—is already present in the population.
Two other types of selection are stabilizing selection and disruptive selection.
Stabilizing selection means that organisms in a population with extreme traits are eliminated. This type of selection
favors organisms with average or medium traits. It “weeds out” the phenotypes that are less adaptive to the
environment. A good example is birth weight in human babies. An abnormally small baby has a higher chance of
having birth defects; conversely, an abnormally large baby will have a challenge in terms of a safe birth delivery.
Disruptive selection, on the other hand, does the reverse. It favors both the extremes and selects against common
traits. For example, females are “selected” to be small and males are “selected” to be large in elephant seals. You’ll
rarely find a female or male of intermediate size.
Another type of selection to be aware of is artificial selection. This is a type of selection where humans direct
