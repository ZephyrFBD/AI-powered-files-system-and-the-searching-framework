Putting Concepts Together
The element bismuth (Bi, atomic number 83) is the heaviest member of group 5A. A salt of the element, bismuth 
subsalicylate, is the active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol®, an over-the-counter medication for gastric distress.
(a) Based on values presented in Figure 7.7 and Tables 7.5 and 7.6, what might you expect for the bonding atomic 
radius of bismuth?
(b) What accounts for the general increase in atomic radius going down the group 5A elements?
(c) Another major use of bismuth has been as an ingredient in low-melting metal alloys, such as those used in ﬁre 
sprinkler systems and in typesetting. The element itself is a brittle white crystalline solid. How do these charac-
teristics ﬁt with the fact that bismuth is in the same periodic group with such nonmetallic elements as nitrogen 
and phosphorus?
(d) Bi2O3 is a basic oxide. Write a balanced chemical equation for its
