 unknown resistance
to be measured,
is placed in the circuit with accurately
known resistances 
and 
(Fig. 19–76). One of these,
is a variable resistor which is adjusted so that when the
switch is closed momentarily, the ammeter 
shows zero
current flow. The bridge is then said to be balanced.

bridge is “balanced”

69. What are the values of effective capacitance which can be
obtained by connecting four identical capacitors, each
having a capacitance C?
70. Electricity can be a hazard in hospitals, particularly to
patients who are connected to electrodes, such as an ECG.
Suppose that the motor of a motorized bed shorts out to the
bed frame, and the bed frame’s conne
