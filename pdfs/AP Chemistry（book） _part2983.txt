pecific heat, and 
heat of vaporization of water from Appendix B, calculate 
the amount of energy required to vaporize 1.00 gal of water 
beginning with water at 20 °C. (b) If the energy is provided 
by electricity costing $0.085>kWh, calculate its cost. (c) If 
distilled water sells in a grocery store for $1.26 per gal, what 
percentage of the sales price is represented by the cost of 
the energy?
 [18.86]  A reaction that contributes to the depletion of ozone in the 
stratosphere is the direct reaction of oxygen atoms with 
ozone:
O1g2 + O31g2 ¡ 2 O21g2
At 298 K the rate constant for this reaction is 4.8 * 105
M-1 s-1. (a) Based on the units of the rate constant, write 
the likely rate law for this reaction. (b) Would you expect 
this reaction to occur via a single elementary process? 
Explain why or why not. (c) Use ∆Hf° values from Appen-
dix C to estimate the enthalpy change for this reaction. 
Would this reaction raise or lower the temperature of the 
stratosphere?
