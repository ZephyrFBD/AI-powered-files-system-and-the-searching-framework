e complex between DNA and proteins) may undergo some chemical modifications, so that the DNA
may be able to slide off the proteins or be accessible to the enzymes of the DNA replication machinery. At the origin of
replication, a pre-replication complex is made with other initiator proteins. Other proteins are then recruited to start the
replication process (Table 14.2).
A helicase using the energy from ATP hydrolysis opens up the DNA helix. Replication forks are formed at each replication
origin as the DNA unwinds. The opening of the double helix causes over-winding, or supercoiling, in the DNA ahead of
the replication fork. These are resolved with the action of topoisomerases. Primers are formed by the enzyme primase, and
using the primer, DNA pol can start synthesis. While the leading strand is continuously synthesized by the enzyme pol δ,
the lagging strand is synthesized by pol ε. A sliding clamp protein known as PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)
holds the DNA pol in place
