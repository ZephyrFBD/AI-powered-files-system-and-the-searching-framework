2. You drop a rock into a pond, and water waves spread out in circles.
(a) The waves carry water outward, away from where the rock hit. That moving
water carries energy outward.
(b) The waves only make the water move up and down. No energy is carried
outward from where the rock hit.
(c) The waves only make the water move up and down, but the waves do carry
energy outward, away from where the rock hit.

any objects vibrate or oscillate—an object on the end of a spring, a tuning
fork, the balance wheel of an old watch, a pendulum, a plastic ruler
held firmly over the edge of a table and gently struck, the strings of a
guitar or piano. Spiders detect prey by the vibrations of their webs; cars oscillate
up and down when they hit a bump; buildings and bridges vibrate when heavy
trucks pass or the wind is fierce. Indeed, because most solids are elastic (see 
Section 9–5), they vibrate (at least briefly) when given an impulse. Electrical oscilla-
tions occur in radio and television sets.
