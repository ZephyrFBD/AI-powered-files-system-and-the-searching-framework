eat. (The wire gets warmer and releases heat to the surroundings.) In Figure 
5.10(b), the battery is used to make a motor turn and the discharge produces 
work. Some heat is released, but not as much as when the battery is shorted 
out. We see that the magnitudes of q and w must be different for these two 
cases. If the initial and final states of the battery are identical in the two cases, 
however, then ∆E = q + w must be the same in both cases because E is a state 
function. Remember: ∆E depends only on the initial and final states of the system, 
not on the specific path taken from the initial to the final state.
