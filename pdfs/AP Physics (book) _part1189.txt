scillates over a very small distance, whereas the wave
itself can travel large distances. Wavelength, frequency, and wave speed all 
have meaning for a longitudinal wave. The wavelength is the distance between
successive compressions (or between successive expansions), and frequency is
the number of compressions that pass a given point per second. The wave speed
is the speed with which each compression appears to move; it is equal to the
product of wavelength and frequency,
(Eq. 11–12).

Speed of Transverse Waves
The speed of a wave depends on the properties of the medium in which it travels.
The speed of a transverse wave on a stretched string or cord, for example, depends
on the tension in the cord,
and on the mass per unit length of the cord,
(the Greek letter mu). If m is the mass of a length 
of wire,
