between variables.
SYI-3.B: Explain how the 
same genotype can result in 
multiple phenotypes under 
different environmental 
conditions.
Environmental 
Effects on 
Phenotype
(A) 
Incorrect. The graph shows the relationship between average nest 
temperature and hatchling sex ratio, not rates of hatchling survival to 
adulthood.
(B) 
Incorrect. This cannot be inferred from the graph.
(C) 
Correct. The graph indicates that more female sea turtles are produced 
in nests with a higher average nest temperature.
(D) 
Incorrect. The graph indicates that the sex of sea turtle hatchlings is 
influenced by temperature.
