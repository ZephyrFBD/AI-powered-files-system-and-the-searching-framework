These are the graphs of one period. Using the fact that these functions are periodic with 
period 2π, we get their complete graphs by continuing the same pattern to the left and to 
the right in every successive interval of length 2π. 
The graph of the sine function is symmetric with respect to the origin. This is as expected, 
since sine is an odd function.  
Cosine function is an even function, its graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. 
 
3.3.2 Transformations of Graphs of Sine and Cosine 
We now consider graphs of functions that are transformations of the sine and cosine 
functions. 
 
Example 1 
Sketch the graph of each function. 
(a) f (x) = 2 + cos x 
(b) g(x) = −cos x 
 
 
 
 
Let’s graph y = 2 sin x. We start with the graph of y = sin x and multiply the y-coordinate of 
each point by 2. This has the effect of stretching the graph vertically by a factor of 2.
