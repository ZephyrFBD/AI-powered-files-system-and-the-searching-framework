all enzymes operate at an ideal temperature. For most human enzymes, this
temperature is body temperature, 37Â°C.
Not all organisms have a constant body temperature. For example, ectotherms depend on the environment to control
their varying body temperatures. Q10 is a measure of temperature sensitivity of a physiological process or enzymatic
reaction rate. If you are faced with a question about Q10 on the AP Biology Exam, you will be provided with the
following formula, so no need to memorize it.
The temperature unit must be in either Celsius or Kelvin, and the same unit must be used for T1 and T2. The two
reaction rates (k1 and k2) must also have the same unit. Q10 has no unit; it is the factor by which the rate of a reaction
increases due to a temperature increase. The more temperature-dependent a reaction is, the higher Q10 will be.
Reactions with Q10 = 1 are temperature independent.
pH
Enzymes also function best at a particular pH. At an incorrect pH, the hydrogen bonds can be disru
