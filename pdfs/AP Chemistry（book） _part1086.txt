If you examine Figure 7.7 carefully, you will discover that for the s- 
and p-block elements the increase in radius moving one element 
down a column tends to be greater than the increase moving one 
element left across a row. There are exceptions, however.
Comment Note that the trends we have just discussed are for the 
s- and p-block elements. As seen in Figure 7.7, the transition ele-
ments do not show a regular decrease moving across a period.

CHAPTER 7 Periodic Properties of the Elements
For ions carrying the same charge, ionic radius increases as we move down a column in the 
periodic table (Figure 7.8). In other words, as the principal quantum number of the outer-
most occupied orbital of an ion increases, the radius of the ion increases.
An isoelectronic series is a group of ions all containing the same number of elec-
trons. For example, each ion in the isoelectronic series O2 -, F-, Na+, Mg2+, and Al3
