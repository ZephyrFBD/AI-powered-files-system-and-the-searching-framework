ric field between the plates is changing in time.
Maxwell resolved the problem of no current through surface 2 in Fig. 22–3 by
proposing that the changing electric field between the plates is equivalent to an
electric current. He called it a displacement current,
An ordinary current I is
then called a “conduction current,” and Ampère’s law, as generalized by Maxwell,
becomes
Ampère’s law will now apply also for surface 2 in Fig. 22–3, where 
refers to the
changing electric field.
Combining Eq. 17–7 for the charge on a capacitor,
with Eq. 17–8,
and with the magnitudes in Eq. 17–4a,
we can write
Then the current 
becomes
where 
is the electric flux, defined in analogy to magnetic flux 
(Section 21–2). Then, Ampère’s law becomes
(22;1)
This equation embodies Maxwell’s idea that a magnetic field can be caused not
only by a normal electric current, but also by a changing electric field or changing
electric flux.
