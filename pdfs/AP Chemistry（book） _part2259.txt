(a) Write the rate law for the reaction, assuming it involves 
a single elementary reaction. (b) Is a single-step mechanism 
likely for this reaction?
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Consider the following reaction: 2 A + B ¡ X + 2 Y. You 
are told that the first step in the mechanism of this reaction 
has the following rate law: Rate = k3A43B4. Which of the 
following could be the first step in the reaction mechanism 
(note that substance Z is an intermediate)?

In scenario (a), would increasing the rate at which cars pass 
through Toll plaza B increase the rate at which cars go from 
point 1 to point 3?
