centration
remains constant as pH changes; lactase activity, however, changes
with varying pH levels.

At the optimum temperature, an enzyme’s catalytic activity is the
greatest. At 40°C, no starch is present (clear/white) aȇer 5 min. This
suggests all the starch was hydrolyzed by amylase. At 30°C, some
starch remains (light gray) aȇer 5 min, indicating the enzyme is not as
eﬀicient at 30°C. At 50°C, the darker-colored spot at 5 min indicates
amylase’s catalytic activity is lower than at 30°C and 40°C. Thus, the
optimum temperature of amylase will fall between 31 and 40 degrees
Celsius, inclusive. (B) is correct.
9. A
Learning Objective: 9.1
Enzymes aﬀect the activation energy but not the free energy of the
substrate and product. The net energy released in the reaction equals
the free energy of the product minus the free energy of the substrate.
Thus, the correct answer is (A). (B) is incorrect because enzymes speed
up reactions by decreasing the activation
