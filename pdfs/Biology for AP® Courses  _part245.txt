 water insulates aquatic
life or bodily fluids from temperature changes.
Third, the low heat of vaporization of water
allows animals to cool themselves by sweating.
25. Describe the pH scale and how it relates to living
systems. Give an example of how drastic pH changes are
prevented in living systems.
a.
The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, where
anything below 7 is acidic and above 7 is
alkaline. The bicarbonate system in the human
body buffers the blood.
b.
The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, where
anything below 7 is alkaline and above 7 is
acidic. The bicarbonate system in human body
buffers the blood.
c.
The pH scale ranges from 0 to 7, where anything
below 7 is acidic and above 7 is alkaline. Water
in the human body buffers the blood.
d.
