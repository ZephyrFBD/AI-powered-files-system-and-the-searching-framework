Energy Basics
Energy is required to do work—to do things, to move things, to put things together. How energy does work follows
two laws of thermodynamics: 
The first law of thermodynamics states that the total amount of energy in the universe remains constant. Energy
cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be converted from one form to another. These forms of energy include
kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (stored energy, such as that in a chemical bond or in
something elevated in a gravitational field).
The second law of thermodynamics states that when energy is converted from one form to another, some energy is
“lost.” The word “lost” is not intended to mean “gone” (that would be a violation of the first law of
thermodynamics). Instead, it means that not all of the energy gets passed from one usable form to another, that some
of the energy becomes unusable or unable to do work. The unusable energy is usually in the form of heat. Further, as
additional energy
