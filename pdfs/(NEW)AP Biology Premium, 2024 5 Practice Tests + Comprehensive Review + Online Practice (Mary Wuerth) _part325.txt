 difference between nonnuclear maternal inheritance and sex-linked inheritance. In sex-linked inheritance, sex-linked genes
are located on a sex chromosome (usually the X chromosome) in the nucleus and can be inherited from either fathers or mothers. In nonnuclear
inheritance, genes are located in the mitochondria or the chloroplast and can only be inherited from the mother.
Phenotype = Genotype + Environment
The environment can affect gene expression and the resulting phenotype of an organism. For example, in the flowers
of the hydrangea plant, a basic soil pH results in flowers with a pink color, while an acidic pH results in blue
flowers. In humans, exposure to ultraviolet light can stimulate the expression of genes involved in the production of
melanin. This ability of the same genotypes to produce different phenotypes in response to different environmental
factors is called phenotypic plasticity.
