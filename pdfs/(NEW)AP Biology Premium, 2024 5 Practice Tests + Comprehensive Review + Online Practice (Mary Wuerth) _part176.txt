e inhibitors and noncompetitive
inhibitors?

allosteric site of the enzyme.
(B) Competitive inhibitors bind to the substrate; noncompetitive inhibitors bind to the products.
(C) The effects of a noncompetitive inhibitor can be mitigated by adding large amounts of substrate.
(D) Competitive inhibitors increase the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions; noncompetitive inhibitors slow the
rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
