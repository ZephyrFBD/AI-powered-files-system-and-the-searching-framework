, independent assortment of 
chromosomes, and fertilization result in genetic 
variation in populations.
SYI-3.C.2
The chromosomal basis of inheritance 
provides an understanding of the pattern of 
transmission of genes from parent to offspring.
SYI-3.C.3
Certain human genetic disorders can 
be attributed to the inheritance of a 
single affected or mutated allele or 
specific chromosomal changes, such as 
nondisjunction.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
SYI-3.C
Explain how chromosomal 
inheritance generates 
genetic variation in sexual 
reproduction.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
SYI-3
Naturally occurring diversity among and between components within biological 
systems affects interactions with the environment.
