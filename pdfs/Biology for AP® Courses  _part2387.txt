form of the protein, and PrPsc, the infectious form. Once introduced into the body, the PrPsc contained within the
prion binds to PrPc and converts it to PrPsc. This leads to an exponential increase of the PrPsc protein, which aggregates.
PrPsc is folded abnormally, and the resulting conformation (shape) is directly responsible for the lesions seen in the brains
of infected cattle. Thus, although not without some detractors among scientists, the prion seems likely to be an entirely new
form of infectious agent, the first one found whose transmission is not reliant upon genes made of DNA or RNA.
Figure 21.18 (a) Endogenous normal prion protein (PrPc) is converted into the disease-causing form (PrPsc) when it
encounters this variant form of the protein. PrPsc may arise spontaneously in brain tissue, especially if a mutant form
of the protein is present, or it may occur via the spread of misfolded prions consumed in food into brain tissue. (b) This
