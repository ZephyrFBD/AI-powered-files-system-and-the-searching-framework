C. Describe the likely reason for the increased
susceptibility of individuals with type A/B blood in terms
of the antigen-antibody model of specific immune
response. Justify the selection of data that would allow a
test of your reasoning.
D. The distribution of blood types was determined in a
population. The results are displayed in the table.
Type
Observed
Frequency
A
501
B
794
A/B

O

Total, N

Recall that the frequency of an allele can be determined if
the genotype is known. For example, for a gene with two
possible alleles the frequency of the dominant allele in a
homozygous dominant population is just twice the number
of individuals 2N divided by the number of alleles which
is 2N also since each individual has 2 alleles at each gene.
The frequency would be 1. For a population composed
entirely of heterozygous individuals the frequency would
be 0.5.
