at happened, things that never happened and things that will happen 
 
 when we all go to America. 
 
 There are slow days at the post office and we sit on the bench and talk. 
 
 We can talk but we are not to laugh. Miss Barry says we should be grateful 
 
 we’re getting paid to sit there, bunch of idlers and streetboys that we 
 
 are, and that there is to be no laughing. Getting paid for sitting and chatting 
 
 is no laughing matter and the first titter out of any of us and out 
 
 we go till we come to our senses and if the tittering continues we’ll be 
 
 reported to the proper authorities. 
 
 The boys talk about her under their breath.Toby Mackey says,What

 Her mother was a streetwalking flaghopper and her father escaped from 
 
 a lunatic asylum with bunions on his balls and warts on his wank. 
 
 There is laughing along the bench and Miss Barry calls to us, I 
 
 warned ye against the laughing.M
