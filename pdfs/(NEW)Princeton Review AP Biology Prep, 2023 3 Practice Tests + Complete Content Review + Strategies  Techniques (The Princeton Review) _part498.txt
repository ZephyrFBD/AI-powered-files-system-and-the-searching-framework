SCORING GUIDELINES
To help you grade this sample free response, we’ve put together a checklist that you can use to calculate the number
of points that should be assigned to each part of this question. We’ll first explain the important points on the
checklist and then give you sample student responses to show you how test reviewers would evaluate them.
