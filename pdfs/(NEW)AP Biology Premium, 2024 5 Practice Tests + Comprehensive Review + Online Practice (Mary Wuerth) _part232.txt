s on direct contact between the cell that is sending the
ligand and the cell that is receiving and responding to it via a surface receptor. Examples of juxtacrine
signaling include plasmodesmata in plants (which involve the ligand traveling between channels that connect
adjacent cells) and antigen-presenting cells in the human immune system (which signal helper T cells
through direct cell-to-cell contact).

3. Paracrine signaling—In paracrine signaling, the cell secretes a ligand that travels a short distance, eliciting
an effect on cells in the nearby area. These ligands are sometimes referred to as local regulators since they
only affect cells in the immediate vicinity of the cell that is sending the signals. Neurotransmitters are local
regulators that travel the short distance across a synapse to communicate with nearby cells.
