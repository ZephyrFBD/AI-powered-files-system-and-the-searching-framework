of Cl in each Cl species in Equation 22.18?
A common use of iodine is as KI in table salt. Iodized salt provides the small amount 
of iodine necessary in our diets; it is essential for the formation of thyroxin, a hormone 
secreted by the thyroid gland. Lack of iodine in the diet results in an enlarged thyroid 
gland, a condition called goiter.
The Hydrogen Halides
All the halogens form stable diatomic molecules with hydrogen. The hydrogen halides 
can be formed by direct reaction of the elements.
The hydrogen halides form hydrohalic acid solutions when dissolved in water. 
These solutions have the characteristic properties of acids, such as reactions with active 
metals to produce hydrogen gas. 
 (Section 4.4) Hydrofluoric acid also reacts readily 
with silica 1SiO22 and with silicates to form hexafluorosilicic acid 1H2SiF62:
 
SiO21s2 + 6 HF1aq2 ยก H2SiF61aq2 + 2 H2O1l2

Interhalogen Compounds
Because the halogens exist as diatomic molecules, diatomic molecules made up of two
