ctic acid in one cup of sour milk 
(assuming the rule of thumb applies), in units of mol/L. 
1One cup = 236.6 mL = 48 teaspoons2. (c) If 1/2 teaspoon 
of baking soda is indeed completely neutralized by the 
lactic acid in sour milk, calculate the volume of carbon di-
oxide gas that would be produced at 1 atm pressure, in an 
oven set to 350 °F.
 17.120  In nonaqueous solvents, it is possible to react HF to create 
H2F+. Which of these statements follows from this obser-
vation? (a) HF can act like a strong acid in nonaqueous 
solvents, (b) HF can act like a base in nonaqueous solvents, 
(c) HF is thermodynamically unstable, (d) There is an acid 
in the nonaqueous medium that is a stronger acid than HF
.
Design an Experiment
You are cleaning up an old chemistry lab and ﬁnd a glass bottle la-
beled “6.00 M NaOH.” The bottle looks like it holds about 5 mL of 
solution. However, it is possible that sodium hydroxide, over a long 
period of time, has reacted with glass 1SiO22. It is also pos
