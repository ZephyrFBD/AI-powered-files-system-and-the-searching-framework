will not be far 
off. As you gain experience, you will begin to look for reactants 
that might not be immediately obvious, such as water from the 
solution or oxygen from the atmosphere. Because proton transfer 
 
(acidâ€“base) and electron transfer (oxidation-reduction) are 
 
involved in a huge number of chemical  
reactions, knowing the 
hallmarks of such reactions will mean you are well on your way to 
becoming an excellent chemist!
