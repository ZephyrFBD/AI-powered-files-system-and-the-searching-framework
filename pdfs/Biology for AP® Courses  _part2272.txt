HGT in Prokaryotes
The mechanism of HGT has been shown to be quite common in the prokaryotic domains of Bacteria and Archaea,
significantly changing the way their evolution is viewed. The majority of evolutionary models, such as in the Endosymbiont
Theory, propose that eukaryotes descended from multiple prokaryotes, which makes HGT all the more important to
understanding the phylogenetic relationships of all extant and extinct species.
The fact that genes are transferred among common
