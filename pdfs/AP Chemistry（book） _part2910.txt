The total amount of freshwater on Earth is not a very large fraction of the total water 
present. Indeed, freshwater is one of our most precious resources. It forms by evapora-
tion from the oceans and the land. The water vapor that accumulates in the atmosphere 
is transported by global atmospheric circulation, eventually returning to Earth as rain, 
snow, and other forms of precipitation (Figure 18.16).
As water runs off the land on its way to the oceans, it dissolves a variety of cations 
(mainly Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Fe2+), anions (mainly Cl-, SO4
2-, and HCO3
-), and 
gases (principally O2, N2, and CO2). As we use water, it becomes laden with additional 
dissolved material, including the wastes of human society. As our population and output 
of environmental pollutants increase, ever-increasing amounts of money and resources 
must be spent to guarantee a supply of freshwater.
