or  
full development.
(B)
This option is incorrect for two reasons: First, the shrubs disappear in this 
progression, so there is no evidence that any change would enhance shrub growth. 
Second, oak trees do not significantly alter the pH of the soil.
(C)
This option is incorrect because shrubs have relatively small root balls and would 
not out-compete an oak tree with a deep tap root. When the shrubs disappear, the 
success of the oak tree does not improve.
(D)
This option is incorrect because there is no evidence in this data of environmental 
pollutants. Although pollutants do affect oak tree growth, oaks are not considered 
more sensitive to them than other trees.
