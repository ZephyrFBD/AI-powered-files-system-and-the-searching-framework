order to maintain solute concentrations within an acceptable
range while swimming in the ocean and eating marine plants.
Inorganic Nutrients and Soil
Inorganic nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are important in the distribution and the abundance of living things.
Plants obtain these inorganic nutrients from the soil when water moves into the plant through the roots. Therefore, soil
structure (particle size of soil components), soil pH, and soil nutrient content play an important role in the distribution of
plants. Animals obtain inorganic nutrients from the food they consume. Therefore, animal distributions are related to the
distribution of what they eat. In some cases, animals will follow their food resource as it moves through the environment.
Other Aquatic Factors
Some abiotic factors, such as oxygen, are important in aquatic ecosystems as well as terrestrial environments. Terrestrial
animals obtain oxygen from the air they breathe. Oxygen availability can be an issue for
