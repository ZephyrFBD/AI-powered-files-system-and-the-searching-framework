biofilm is a microbial community held together in a gummy-textured matrix.
22.2 Structure of Prokaryotes
Prokaryotes (domains Archaea and Bacteria) are single-celled organisms lacking a nucleus. They have a single piece of
circular DNA in the nucleoid area of the cell. Most prokaryotes have a cell wall that lies outside the boundary of the
plasma membrane. Some prokaryotes may have additional structures such as a capsule, flagella, and pili. Bacteria and
Archaea differ in the lipid composition of their cell membranes and the characteristics of the cell wall. In archaeal
membranes, phytanyl units, rather than fatty acids, are linked to glycerol. Some archaeal membranes are lipid monolayers
instead of bilayers.
The cell wall is located outside the cell membrane and prevents osmotic lysis. The chemical composition of cell walls
varies between species. Bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan. Archaean cell walls do not have peptidoglycan, but
they may have pseudopept
