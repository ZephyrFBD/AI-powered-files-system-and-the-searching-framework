e ratio (G/V). The genetic material (chromosomes) in the nucleus, collectively called its
genome, controls the cell by producing substances that make enzymes and other biosynthetic substances. These
substances, in turn, regulate cellular activities. The capacity of the genome to do this is limited by its finite amount
of genetic material. As the cell grows, its volume increases, but its genome size remains constant. As the G/V
decreases, the cellâ€™s size exceeds the ability of its genome to produce sufficient amounts of materials for regulating
cellular activities.
At the molecular level, the cell cycle is strictly controlled by various signal molecules within the cell. These signals
respond to internal factors, insuring that the necessary steps in the cell cycle have been accurately completed before
going on to the next step in the cell cycle.
1. Checkpoints. At specific points during the cell cycle, the cell evaluates internal and external conditions to
determine whether or not to con
