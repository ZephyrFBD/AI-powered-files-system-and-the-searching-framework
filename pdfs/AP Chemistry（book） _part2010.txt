(a) What are the C ¬C ¬C bond angles in diamond? 
(b) What are they in graphite (in one sheet)? (c) What 
atomic orbitals are involved in the stacking of graphite 
sheets with each other?
(a) Name another compound that has the same structure. 
(b) Would you expect the bonding in SiC to be predomi-
nantly ionic, metallic, or covalent? (c) How do the bond-
ing and structure of SiC lead to its high thermal stability 
(to 2700 °C) and exceptional hardness?

Energy bands are considered continuous due to the large 
number of closely spaced energy levels. The range of energy 
levels in a crystal of copper is approximately 1 * 10–19 J. 
Assuming equal spacing between levels, the spacing be-
tween energy levels may be approximated by dividing the 
range of energies by the number of atoms in the crystal. 
(a) How many copper atoms are in a piece of copper metal 
in the shape of a cube with edge length 0.5 mm? The den-
sity of copper is 8.96 g/cm3. (b
