osome until stress causes it to
be excised, taking some of the bacterial chromosome with it.
(A)
The virus produces enzymes that cause the host DNA to be
broken down into fragments and pieces of host DNA are
transferred to subsequent bacteria through bacterial
transformation.
(B)
The virus contains RNA that has mutated to code for the
toxin, which it injects into the host cell to be translated,
packaged, and released as a protein Â into the extracellular
space.
(C)
The virus contains RNA that has mutated to code for the toxin
and uses reverse transcriptase to convert the toxin gene to
DNA, so it can be processed and distributed by the host cell.
(D)
11. A microbiologist studies proteins from a virus that he obtained
from a monkey. He finds that the virus is an enveloped RNA virus
that actually infected bacteria found in the samples, rather than
the monkey cells themselves. Which of the following correctly
identifies this type of virus and explains why?
Retrovirus, since it contains RNA
