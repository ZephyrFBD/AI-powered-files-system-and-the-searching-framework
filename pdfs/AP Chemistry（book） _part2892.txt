Give It Some Thought
What photochemical reaction involving nitrogen oxides initiates the formation of 
photochemical smog?
Greenhouse Gases: Water Vapor, Carbon Dioxide,  
and Climate
In addition to screening out harmful short-wavelength radiation, the atmosphere is 
essential in maintaining a reasonably uniform and moderate temperature on Earth’s 
surface. Earth is in overall thermal balance with its surroundings. This means that 
the planet radiates energy into space at a rate equal to the rate at which it absorbs 
energy from the Sun. Figure 18.12 shows the flow of energy into and out of Earth, and
