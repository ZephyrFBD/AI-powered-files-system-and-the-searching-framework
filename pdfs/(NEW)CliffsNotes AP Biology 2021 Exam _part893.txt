quations and formulas pages, is 3.84 for a level of significance of p = 0.05. Since 5.76 exceeds the
critical value of 3.84, the null hypothesis (that the yellow seeds were heterozygous) is rejected.
2. Answer: 0.09 (acceptable range: 0.08-0.09)
 
First, calculate the change in DO2 for both bottles by subtracting the initial DO2 value from the final DO2 value.
Organisms in the pond
 
water exposed to light were both undergoing photosynthesis and
 
respiration, so DO2 for the bottle community exposed to light
 
represented oxygen values associated with net primary productivity
(gross primary activity - respiratory rate). Second, convert the DO2 values from units of mg O2/L to mL/L using the
formula provided on the equations and formulas pages (1 mg O2 = 0.698 mL O2). Then
calculate the amount of carbon fixed using the other formula provided
 
(1 mL of O2 produced generates 0.536 mg carbon fixed). A summary
 
of these calculations is provided in the following table:
 
The respiratory rat
