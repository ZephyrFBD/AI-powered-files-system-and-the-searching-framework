n reopen them, looking again at the white paper or wall; the afterimage of the flag should continue to
appear as red, white, and blue. What causes this? According to an explanation called opponent process theory, as you gazed
fixedly at the green, black, and yellow flag, your retinal ganglion cells that respond positively to green, black, and yellow
increased their firing dramatically. When you shifted your gaze to the neutral white ground, these ganglion cells abruptly
decreased their activity and the brain interpreted this abrupt downshift as if the ganglion cells were responding now to their
“opponent” colors: red, white, and blue, respectively, in the visual field. Once the ganglion cells return to their baseline
activity state, the false perception of color will disappear.
