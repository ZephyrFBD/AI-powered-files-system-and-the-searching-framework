al means. Only the floating disk 
technique is described in the Student Manual, and alternative procedures may be equally 
and successfully substituted. For example, in the procedures outlined in the Student 
Manual, production of O2 gas in photosynthesis is measured, but students also can 
measure the production of CO2, or even simultaneous changes in volumes of both gases, 
depending on available equipment (e.g., gas sensor probes with computer interface).

Measuring the rate of photosynthesis is a challenge in a high school laboratory. 
Because the purchase of appropriate sensors or instrumentation is expensive, the  
floating disk system described in the Student Manual provides an easier, cheaper,  
and more reliable method to study both photosynthetic rates as well as rates of 
respiration. The cost of materials and equipment is under $0.50 per student  
(exclusive of light sources or meters). A video outlining the method can be found at
