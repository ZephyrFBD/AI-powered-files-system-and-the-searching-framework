 neg-
ative reduction potential in Table 20.1 is the one most easily reversed and run as an oxidation. 
Being at the bottom of Table 20.1, Li+1aq2 is the most difficult species in the list to reduce 
and is therefore the poorest oxidizing agent listed. Although Li+1aq2 has little tendency 
to gain electrons, the reverse reaction, oxidation of Li(s) to Li+1aq2, is highly favorable. 
Thus, Li is the strongest reducing agent among the substances listed in Table 20.1. (Note 
that, because Table 20.1 lists half-reactions as reductions, only the substances on the 
reactant side of these equations can serve as oxidizing agents; only those on the product 
side can serve as reducing agents.)
Commonly used reducing agents include H2 and the active metals, such as the alkali 
metals and the alkaline earth metals. Other metals whose cations have negative E°
red val-
ues—Zn and Fe, for example—are also used as reducing agents. Solutions of reducing 
agents are difficult to store for extended period
