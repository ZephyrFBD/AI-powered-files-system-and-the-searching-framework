stretch, or lengthening of muscles. Related to these are
Golgi tendon organs, which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction. Proprioceptive and kinesthetic
signals come from limbs. Unconscious proprioceptive signals run from the spinal cord to the cerebellum, the brain region
that coordinates muscle contraction, rather than to the thalamus, like most other sensory information.
Baroreceptors detect pressure changes in an organ. They are found in the walls of the carotid artery and the aorta where
they monitor blood pressure, and in the lungs where they detect the degree of lung expansion. Stretch receptors are found at
various sites in the digestive and urinary systems.
In addition to these two types of deeper receptors, there are also rapidly adapting hair receptors, which are found on nerve
endings that wrap around the base of hair follicles. There are a few types of hair receptors that detect slow and rapid hair
movement, and they differ in their sensitivity
