Complex III
The third complex is composed of cytochrome b, another Fe-S protein, Rieske center (2Fe-2S center), and cytochrome c
proteins; this complex is also called cytochrome oxidoreductase. Cytochrome proteins have a prosthetic group of heme.
The heme molecule is similar to the heme in hemoglobin, but it carries electrons, not oxygen. As a result, the iron ion at
its core is reduced and oxidized as it passes the electrons, fluctuating between different oxidation states: Fe++ (reduced)
and Fe+++ (oxidized). The heme molecules in the cytochromes have slightly different characteristics due to the effects of
the different proteins binding them, giving slightly different characteristics to each complex. Complex III pumps protons
through the membrane and passes its electrons to cytochrome c for transport to the fourth complex of proteins and enzymes
(cytochrome c is the acceptor of electrons from Q; however, whereas Q carries pairs of elec
