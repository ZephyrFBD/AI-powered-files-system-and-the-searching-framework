iption of the molecular structure of molecules and the
chemistry of metabolic reactions. It is the understanding of biological processes at the molecular level that provides
you with a more thorough understanding of biology. The AP examiners want to know whether you have this kind of
understanding. With that in mind, your studying should begin with a brief review of chemistry and the
characteristics of major groups of biological molecules.
Although chemistry deepens your understanding of biology, the AP exam will not ask you to draw molecular
structures or to distinguish fine differences between molecules. You will only need to be able to recognize very
major distinctions between groups of similar types of molecules.
Atoms, Molecules, Ions, and Bonds
An atom consists of a nucleus of positively charged protons and neutrally charged neutrons. Negatively charged
electrons are arranged outside the nucleus. Molecules are groups of two or more atoms held together by chemical
bonds. Chemical
