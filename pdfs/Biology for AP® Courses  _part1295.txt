at the pea-plant characteristics he studied were transmitted as discrete units from parent to
offspring. As will be discussed, Mendel also determined that different characteristics, like seed color and seed texture, were
transmitted independently of one another and could be considered in separate probability analyses. For instance, performing
a cross between a plant with green, wrinkled seeds and a plant with yellow, round seeds still produced offspring that had a
3:1 ratio of green:yellow seeds (ignoring seed texture) and a 3:1 ratio of round:wrinkled seeds (ignoring seed color). The
characteristics of color and texture did not influence each other.
The product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of characteristics. The
product rule states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the
individual probabilities of each event occurring alone. To demonstrate the product rule, imagine
