ult is a model that precisely describes the 
energy of the electron while describing its location not precisely but rather in terms of 
probabilities.

assistantship with Niels Bohr, Heisenberg 
formulated his famous uncertainty principle. 
At 32 he was one of the youngest scientists

A Closer look Measurement and the Uncertainty Principle
Whenever any measurement is made, some uncertainty exists. 
Our experience with objects of ordinary dimensions, such as balls 
or trains or laboratory equipment, indicates that using more pre-
cise instruments can decrease the uncertainty of a measurement. 
In fact, we might expect that the uncertainty in a measurement 
can be made infintesimally small. However, the uncertainty prin-
ciple states that there is an actual limit to the accuracy of mea-
surements. This limit is not a restriction on how well instruments 
can be made; rather, it is inherent in
