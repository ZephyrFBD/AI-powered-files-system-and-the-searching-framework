DC motor
Most motors contain several coils, called windings, each connected to a different
portion of the armature, Fig. 20–39. Current flows through each coil only during a
small part of a revolution, at the time when its orientation results in the maximum
torque. In this way, a motor produces a much steadier torque than can be obtained
from a single coil.
An ac motor, with ac current as input, can work without commutators since the
current itself alternates. Many motors use wire coils to produce the magnetic field
(electromagnets) instead of a permanent magnet. Indeed the design of most motors
is more complex than described here, but the general principles remain the same.
Loudspeakers and Headsets
Loudspeakers and audio headsets also work on the principle that a magnet exerts
a force on a current-carrying wire. The electrical output of
