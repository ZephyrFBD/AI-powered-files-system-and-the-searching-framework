Secondary Growth
The increase in stem thickness that results from secondary growth is due to the activity of the lateral meristems, which are
lacking in herbaceous plants. Lateral meristems include the vascular cambium and, in woody plants, the cork cambium (see
Figure 23.10). The vascular cambium is located just outside the primary xylem and to the interior of the primary phloem.
The cells of the vascular cambium divide and form secondary xylem (tracheids and vessel elements) to the inside, and
secondary phloem (sieve elements and companion cells) to the outside. The thickening of the stem that occurs in secondary
growth is due to the formation of secondary phloem a
