FIGURE 18–17 Example 18–8.
Headlights. Calculate the resistance of a 40-W automobile
headlight designed for 12 V (Fig. 18–17).
APPROACH We solve for R in Eq. 18–6b, which has the given variables.
SOLUTION From Eq. 18–6b,
NOTE This is the resistance when the bulb is burning brightly at 40 W. When
the bulb is cold, the resistance is much lower, as we saw in Eq. 18–4 (see also
Exercise G). Since the current is high when the resistance is low, lightbulbs burn
out most often when first turned on.
R = V2

EXAMPLE 18;8
It is energy, not power, that you pay for on your electric bill. Since power is the
rate energy is transformed, the total energy used by any device is simply its power
consumption multiplied by the time it is on. If the power is in watts and the time is
in seconds, the energy will be in joules since 
Electric companies
usually specify the energy with a much larger unit, the kilowatt-hour (kWh).
One kWh = (1000 W)(3600 s) = 3.60 * 106 J.
1 W = 1 Js.
