becomes cation–cation, anion–anion. 
The resulting repulsive interaction causes the planes to split away from each other, 
a property that lends itself to the carving of certain gemstones (such as ruby, com-
posed principally of Al2O3).
Structures of Ionic Solids
Like metallic solids, ionic solids tend to adopt structures with symmetric, close-
packed arrangements of atoms. However, important differences arise because we 
now have to pack together spheres that have different radii and opposite charges. 
Because cations are often considerably smaller than anions 
 (Section 7.3), the 
coordination numbers in ionic compounds are smaller than those in close-packed 
metals. Even if the anions and cations were the same size, the close-packed arrange-
ments seen in metals cannot be replicated without letting ions of like charge come 
in contact with each other. The repulsions between ions of the same type make 
such arrangements unfavorable. The most favorable structures are those where the
