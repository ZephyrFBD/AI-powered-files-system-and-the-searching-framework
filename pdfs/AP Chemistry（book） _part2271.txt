the help of catalysts. Much industrial chemical research is 
devoted to the search for more effective catalysts for reactions of commercial importance. 
Extensive research efforts also are devoted to finding means of inhibiting or removing 
certain catalysts that promote undesirable reactions, such as those that corrode metals, 
age our bodies, and cause tooth decay.
Homogeneous Catalysis
A catalyst that is present in the same phase as the reactants in a reaction mixture is called 
a homogeneous catalyst. Examples abound both in solution and in the gas phase. 
Consider, for example, the decomposition of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, H2O21aq2, into 
water and oxygen:
 
2 H2O21aq2 ยก 2 H2O1l2 + O21g2 
[14.31]
In the absence of a catalyst, this reaction occurs extremely slowly. Many substances are 
capable of catalyzing the reaction, however, including bromide ion, which reacts with 
hydrogen peroxide in acidic solution, forming aqueous bromine and water (Figure 14.21).
