agnetic field B due to the current in a long 
straight wire is directly proportional to the current I in the wire and inversely
proportional to the distance r from the wire:
This relation is valid as long as r, the perpendicular distance to the wire, is much
less than the distance to the ends of the wire (i.e., the wire is long).
The proportionality constant is written as 
, so

The value of the constant 
which is called the permeability of free space, is†

ered more fundamental, will have a simple and elegant form.
