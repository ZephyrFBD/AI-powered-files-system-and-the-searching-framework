sent in two glucose molecules without taking into account the atoms lost from
the water molecule that was removed in the dehydration synthesis reaction.
6. (C) Tertiary protein structures in the cell are most stable when their hydrophilic amino acids are on the surface
of the protein, in contact with the watery cytosol of the cell. Choices (A) and (B) are incorrect because
hydrophobic amino acids are more likely to be found in the interior of a protein, away from water in the cytosol.
Choice (D) is incorrect because hydrophilic amino acids would not avoid water; they would be more stable
when interacting with water.
7. (A) The primary structure of a protein is the sequence of amino acids held together by peptide bonds. Choice
(B) is incorrect because secondary structure is formed by the hydrogen bonds between amino acids in a
polypeptide chain. Tertiary structure is the globular shape formed by a polypeptide chain, so choice (C) is
incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because quaternary
