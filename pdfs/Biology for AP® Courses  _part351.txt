storage carbohydrate in plants
type of lipid composed of four fused hydrocarbon rings forming a planar structure
three-dimensional conformation of a protein, including interactions between secondary structural
elements; formed from interactions between amino acid side chains
fat formed artificially by hydrogenating oils, leading to a different arrangement of double bond(s) than those
found in naturally occurring lipids
process through which messenger RNA forms on a template of DNA
RNA that carries activated amino acids to the site of protein synthesis on the ribosome
process through which RNA directs the formation of protein
fat molecule; consists of three fatty acids linked to a glycerol molecule
long-chain hydrocarbon that has one or more double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain
lipid made of a long-chain fatty acid that is esterified to a long-chain alcohol; serves as a protective coating on some
feathers, aquatic mammal fur, and leaves
