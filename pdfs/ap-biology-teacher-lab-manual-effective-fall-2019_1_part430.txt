ded into three parts: interphase, 
mitosis, and cytokinesis (Figure 1). In the first growth phase (G1), the cell grows 
and prepares to duplicate its DNA. In the synthesis phase (S), the chromosomes are 
replicated. In the second growth phase (G2), the cell prepares to divide. In mitosis, the 
duplicated chromosomes are separated into two nuclei. In most cases, mitosis is followed 
by cytokinesis, when the cytoplasm divides and organelles separate into daughter cells. 
This type of cell division is asexual and is important for growth, renewal, and repair of 
multicellular organisms.
