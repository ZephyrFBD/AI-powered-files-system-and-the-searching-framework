 of introns can be mutated without
ultimately affecting the protein product.
All of a pre-mRNAâ€™s introns must be completely and precisely removed before protein synthesis. If the process errs by even
a single nucleotide, the reading frame of the rejoined exons would shift, and the resulting protein would be dysfunctional.
The process of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called splicing (Figure 15.14). Introns are removed and
degraded while the pre-mRNA is still in the nucleus. Splicing occurs by a sequence-specific mechanism that ensures introns
will be removed and exons rejoined with the accuracy and precision of a single nucleotide. The splicing of pre-mRNAs is
conducted by complexes of proteins and RNA molecules called spliceosomes.
