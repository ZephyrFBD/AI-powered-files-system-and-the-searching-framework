 Bacterial Transformation
Plate Number
Condition
Observation
1
LB with transformed plasmid (positive control)
Lawn
2
LB without transformed plasmid (negative control)
Lawn
3
LB/Amp with transformed plasmid (experimental)
50 colonies
4
LB/Amp without transformed plasmid (positive control)
None
Interpretation of this Exercise
Plate numbers 1 and 2 will have lawns (growth) of bacteria because there was no antibiotic in the
plate agar.
Plate number 3 had 50 transformed colonies because some of the cells were transformed with the
plasmids containing the gene for resistance to ampicillin.
Plate number 4 has no colonies since no plasmid was transformed, and the bacteria are susceptible to
ampicillin.
Exercise 8B:
 Transformation Efficiency
Interpretation of this Exercise
Total mass of plasmid use = 0.0075 μg/μL x 20 μL = 1.5μg
Total volume of cell suspension = 500 μL
Mass of plasmid in suspension 
Number of colonies per μg of plasmid
