trioles, and various
cytoskeletal components. In addition, both FtsZ and tubulin employ the same energy source, GTP
(guanosine triphosphate), to rapidly assemble and disassemble complex structures.
FtsZ and tubulin are homologous structures derived from common evolutionary origins. In this example,
FtsZ is the ancestor protein to tubulin (a modern protein). While both proteins are found in extant organisms,
tubulin function has evolved and diversified tremendously since evolving from its FtsZ prokaryotic origin.
A survey of mitotic assembly components found in present-day unicellular eukaryotes reveals crucial
intermediary steps to the complex membrane-enclosed genomes of multicellular eukaryotes (Table 10.4).
