bacteria. (See page 181.) However, regulation of genes in humans is far
more complex. Although every cell in your body contains the same 3
billion base pairs of DNA, a typical cell only expresses a small percentage
of its genes at any one time. The expression of genes is tightly regulated
by different mechanisms. These mechanisms are described below. See
