Fluidity helps only in transport of some
materials, and does not contribute to the
flexibility.
c.
Fluidity helps in maintaining the pH of
intracellular fluid, and helps in maintaining the
physiological pH of the cell.
d.
Fluidity helps in providing mechanical strength
to the plasma membrane.
20. List four components of a plasma membrane and
explain their function.
a.
Phospholipids: form the bilayer; Carbohydrates:
help in adhesion; Cholesterol: provide
flexibility; Integral proteins: form transporters;
Peripheral proteins: part of the cell’s recognition
sites.

c.
Phospholipids: form the bilayer; Carbohydrates:
part of the cell’s recognition sites; Cholesterol:
provide flexibility to the membrane; Integral
proteins: form transporters; Intermediate
filaments: help in adhesion.
