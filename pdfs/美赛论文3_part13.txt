2.1.5 Brief explanation about influencing factors
2.1.5.1 The area of the interface
The volume and shape of the bathtub will influence the area of the interface
between water and air so as to influence the value of
0
k . It is not very hard to find
that the bigger the area of the interface is, more heat will be lost in the same time,
which means the value of
0
k is bigger.
2.1.5.2 The properties of the interface
The properties of the i
