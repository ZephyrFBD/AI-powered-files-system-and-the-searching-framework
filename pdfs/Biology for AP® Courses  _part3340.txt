Describe why Type 1 diabetes is considered an autoimmune disease.
a.
The immune system attacks the hypothalamus, which prevents thyroxine production to regulate blood
glucose.
b.
The immune system attacks cells of the pituitary gland, which prevents insulin production to regulate blood
glucose.
c.
The immune system attacks beta cells of the pancreas, which prevents insulin production to regulate blood
glucose.
d.
The immune system attacks beta cells of the pancreas, which prevents insulin production to regulate growth.
Impaired insulin function can lead to a condition called diabetes mellitus, the main symptoms of which are illustrated
in Figure 28.10. This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas, or by reduced
sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin. This prevents glucose from being absorbed by cells, causing high levels of blood
glucose, or hyperglycemia (high sugar). High blood glucose levels make it difficult for the kidneys to recover a
