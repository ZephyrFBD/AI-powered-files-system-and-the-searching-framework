example, the ionic compound formed from Mg (which forms Mg2+ ions) and N (which 
forms N3- ions) is Mg3N2:
Mg
Mg3N2
2 1
N 3 2
There is one caveat to using this approach. Remember that the empirical formula should 
be the smallest possible whole-number ratio of the two elements. So the empirical formula 
for the ionic compound formed between Ti4+ and O2- is TiO2 rather than Ti2O4.
