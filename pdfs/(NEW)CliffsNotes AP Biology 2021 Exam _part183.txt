ospholipid bilayer of a membrane. They bind
to membrane receptors at the membrane surface.
Hydrophobic ligands and certain small molecules are signaling molecules that are able to cross the membrane
unaided. They bind to intracellular receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus.
Receptor proteins are molecules that have binding sites for signaling molecules. When activated by a specific
signaling molecule, they initiate a series of reactions that activates a cellular process. There are two kinds of receptor
proteins:
Membrane receptors are transmembrane proteins, extending from the outside to the inside of a membrane. The part
of the receptor protein that faces away from the cell presents a binding site for a specific signaling molecule. The
other end of the protein, facing the cytoplasm, initiates a chemical reaction.
Intracellular receptors are proteins that occur in the cytoplasm or nucleus.
Second messengers are molecules that relay a signal from the inside face of a receptor protein to
