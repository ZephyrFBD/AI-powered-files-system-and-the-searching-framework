edly changed the role of the textbook as one element among 
many tools for student learning. Our challenge as authors is 
to maintain the text as the primary source of chemical knowl-
edge and practice, while at the same time integrating it with 
the new avenues for learning made possible by technology. 
This edition incorporates a number of those new methodolo-
gies, including use of computer-based classroom tools, such 
as Learning CatalyticsTM, a cloud-based active learning ana-
lytics and assessment system, and web-based tools, particu-
larly MasteringChemistryTM, which is continually evolving to 
provide more effective means of testing and evaluating stu-
dent performance, while giving the student immediate and 
helpful feedback. MasteringChemistryTM not only provides 
feedback on a question by question basis, but using Knew-
ton-enhanced adaptive follow-up assignments and Dynamic 
Study Modules, it now continually adapts to
