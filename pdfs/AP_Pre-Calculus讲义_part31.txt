s a smooth curve; that is, it has no corners 
or sharp points (cusps) as shown below. 
 
The domain of a polynomial function is the set of all real numbers, so we can sketch only a 
small portion of the graph. However, for values of x outside the portion of the graph we 
have drawn, we can describe the behavior of the graph. 
The end behavior of a polynomial is a description of what happens as x becomes large in 
the positive or negative direction. To describe end behavior, we use the following arrow 
notation. 
 
For example, the monomial y = x2 has the following end behavior.

1.6.4 Using Zeros to Graph Polynomial 
If P is a polynomial function, then c is called a zero of P if P (c) = 0.  
Note that if P(c) = 0, then the graph of P has an x-intercept at x = c, so the x-intercepts of
