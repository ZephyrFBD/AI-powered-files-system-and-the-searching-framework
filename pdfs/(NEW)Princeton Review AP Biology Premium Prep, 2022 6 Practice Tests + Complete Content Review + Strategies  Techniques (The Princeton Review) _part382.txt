mates, as much
as 99 percent of our genetic code is identical to that of a chimp. All eukaryotes have
membrane-bound organelles, linear chromosomes, and genes that contain introns.
Continuing Evolution: There is evidence that evolution is constantly occurring. We can see
consistent small changes in DNA and changes in the fossil record. We can see evolution of
resistance to antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides, or chemotherapy drugs since these are
particularly strong selective pressures. We can also see how fast replicating pathogens evolve
and cause emergent diseases never before seen.
Across every domain, there are certain universal molecules and structures.
Many metabolic pathways are also conserved and vary only a little between
species.
COMMON ANCESTRY
By using the evidence mentioned above, scientists can get a good handle on how evolution of certain species
occurred. It all comes down to who has common ancestors. Life started somewhere. Some original life-form is the
common ancest
