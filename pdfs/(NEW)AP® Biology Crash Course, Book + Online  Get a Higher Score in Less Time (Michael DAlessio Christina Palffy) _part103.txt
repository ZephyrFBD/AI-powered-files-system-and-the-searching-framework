elanins. For an organism without albinism, the reaction should look like this:
DOPA— — — — — — -→ melanins
In albinism, the reaction looks like this:
DOPA— — — — // — — → (no melanins)
Bottom line: A protein contained an abnormal allele that could not produce a specific product that was
necessary for this reaction to proceed, and it resulted in albinism.

Nucleic Acid Technology and Applications
I.
Key Concepts
A. DNA technology is a collection of procedures for manipulating and analyzing DNA that aid in all aspects
of biological research and in developing technical applications for a wide range of purposes.
B. DNA technology has created many powerful tools for basic research, as well as for commercial use in
agriculture and medicine.

Genetic Engineering Techniques
A. DNA Cloning
1. Restriction Enzymes—used to cut DNA molecules at specific locations called restriction sites.
2. Recombinant DNA combining DNA sequences that would not normally occur together to form one
