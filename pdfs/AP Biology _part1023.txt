TP will be produced later. Choice B is incorrect
because it describes substrate-level phosphorylation, not oxidative
phosphorylation. Choice C is incorrect because the bonding of
electrons to oxygen produces water.
(D) The exergonic flow of electrons in the electron transport chain
of mitochondria provides the energy to establish a proton gradient.
Most CO2 that is released from cellular respiration comes from the
citric acid cycle. Protons flow through the ATP synthase down a
gradient, not by active transport.
(B) Oxygen is needed to attract electrons down an electron transport
chain in the light-dependent reactions. Water entering the plant
through the roots ultimately provides hydrogen for the Calvin cycle,
but first it is needed in the light-dependent reactions. CO2 enters the
plant through the stomates; it is not released by the light-dependent
reactions.
(A) The only thing this process produces is ATP. No NADPH or
oxygen is released. The function of this process is to provide ATP
