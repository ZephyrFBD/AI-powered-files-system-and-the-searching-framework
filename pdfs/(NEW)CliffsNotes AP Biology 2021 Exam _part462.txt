m inorganic substances (as
in chemosynthesis).
2. Heterotrophs (chemoheterotrophs) must obtain their energy by consuming organic substances produced by
autotrophs. Familiar heterotrophs are animals that eat plants or other animals. Others are parasites that obtain
energy from their hosts while living on or in their living tissues. Others, the decomposers, obtain their energy from
dead, decaying matter.
All living things are classified into three domainsâ€”Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The major characteristics of
each of the three domains are described below.
Domain Bacteria
Bacteria are prokaryotes. They are distinguished from archaea and eukaryotes by the following features:
 
1. Bacterial cell walls are made with peptidoglycan, a polymer of a monosaccharide with amino acids.
 
2. Certain antibiotics disable the activity of bacterial ribosomes and disrupt protein synthesis.
Bacteria are the most numerous of all organisms, both in numbers of individuals and in numbers of species. They
