t absorbs light) responsible for the initial interaction between
light and plant material, and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain. The thylakoid membrane encloses
an internal space called the thylakoid lumen. As shown in Figure 8.6, a stack of thylakoids is called a granum, and the
liquid-filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or “bed” (not to be confused with stoma or “mouth,” an opening
on the leaf epidermis).
Figure 8.6 Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts, which have an outer membrane and an inner membrane.
Stacks of thylakoids called grana form a third membrane layer.
On a hot, dry day, plants close their stomata to conserve water. What impact will this have on photosynthesis?
a.
Rate of photosynthesis will be inhibited as the level of carbon dioxide decreases.
b.
Rate of photosynthesis will be inhibited as the level of oxygen decreases.
c.
The rate of photosynthesis will increase as the level of carbon dioxide increases.
d.
Rate of pho
