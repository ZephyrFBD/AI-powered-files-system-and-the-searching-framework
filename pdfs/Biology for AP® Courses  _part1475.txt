new DNA during S phase in either meiosis or mitosis are
not repaired. These errors usually involve single
nucleotides. Errors that occur during prophase I of meiosis
that are not corrected can involve the exchange of
sequences between homologous chromosomes
(duplications) or even nonhomologous chromosomes
(translocations). Duplications are usually retained, and the
organism remains viable without a change in phenotype.
Translocations are usually lethal or significantly alter
phenotype. In eukaryotes, duplications and the shuffling of
parental genes through recombination are important
