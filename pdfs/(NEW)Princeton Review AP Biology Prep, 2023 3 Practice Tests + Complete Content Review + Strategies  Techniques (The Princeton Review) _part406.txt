lication can result in a new allele being
introduced.
3. If immigration or emigration is present, species entering or leaving a population will bring or remove alleles
with them.
4. If there is non-random mating, individuals will be selective in how they pick their mating partners based on a
trait or traits. For example, if female peahens prefer peacocks with brighter tails, the alleles that contribute to the
brighter tails phenotype will be preferentially propagated, and allele frequencies will accordingly shift.
5. If there is natural selection, organisms better adapted to their environment will be more likely to survive and
reproduce, and thus their alleles will be preferentially propagated to the next generation. Changes in allele
frequencies provide evidence for evolution occurring in a population.
Hardy-Weinberg Equations
Letâ€™s say that the allele for red eyes, R, is dominant over the allele for green eyes, r. Red-eyed fruit flies include
homozygous dominants, RR, and heterozygou
