3.1 Unit Circle 
3.1.1 The Unit Circle 
In this section we explore some properties of the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. 
The set of points at a distance 1 from the origin is a circle of radius 1. 
 
The unit circle is the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin in the xy-plane. Its equation is

3.1.2 Terminal Points on the Unit Circle 
Suppose t is a real number. If t is greater than or equal to 0, letâ€™s mark off a distance t 
along the unit circle, starting at the point (1, 0) and moving in a counterclockwise direction. 
If t<0, we mark off a distance |t| in a clockwise direct
