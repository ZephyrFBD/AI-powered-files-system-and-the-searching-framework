able, you have 
probably used the equation correctly.
Sometimes you will not be given explicit values for several vari-
ables, making it look like a problem that cannot be solved. In these 
cases, however, you should look for information that can be used to 
determine the needed variables. For example, suppose you are using 
the ideal-gas equation to calculate a pressure in a problem that gives 
a value for T but not for n or V. However, the problem states that “the 
sample contains 0.15 mol of gas per liter.” You can turn this state-
ment into the expression
 
n
V = 0.15 mol>L 
Solving the ideal-gas equation for pressure yields
P = nRT
V  
which we can rewrite as follows:
 
P = a n
VbRT 
Thus, we can solve the equation even though we are not given values 
for n and V.
As we have continuously stressed, the most important thing 
you can do to become proficient at solving chemistry problems is 
to do the practice exercises and end-of-chapter exercises. By using 
systematic procedures, su
