eficiency virus (HIV) reproduces
very quickly. A single virus can replicate itself a billion
times in one 24-hour period. In a hypothetical treatment
situation, a patientâ€™s HIV population consists entirely of
drug-resistant viruses after just a few weeks of treatment.
How can this treatment result best be explained? How
does this explanation illustrate that evolution is an ongoing
process?
a.
The resistant viruses passed their genes to the
non-resistant viruses so that 100% of the viruses
became resistant. This illustrates evolution as an
ongoing process because the genes of the
population changed in real time.
b.
The non-resistant viruses died, and the resistant
ones survived and rapidly reproduced. This
illustrates evolution as an ongoing process
because the change in the HIV population is the
result of natural selection.
c.
The viruses developed resistance to the drug
after repeated exposure to it. This illustrates
evolution as an ongoing process because the
viruses were able to ada
