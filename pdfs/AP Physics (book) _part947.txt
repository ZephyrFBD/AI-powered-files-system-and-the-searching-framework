Solving for

given in Fig.9–14b, we find
where w is the total weight of the body. To get the components of 
we use 
the x and y components of the force equation (noting that

and

where we keep 3 significant figures for calculating, but round off to 2 for giving
the answer. Then
The angle that 
makes with the horizontal is given by

NOTE The force on the lowest vertebra is over 
times the total body weight!
This force is exerted by the “sacral” bone at the base of the spine, through the
somewhat flexible intervertebral disk. The disks at the base of the spine are
clearly being compressed under very large forces. [If the body was less bent
over (say, the 30° angle in Fig. 9–14b becomes 40° or 50°), then the stress on the
lower back will be less (see Problem 33).]
If the person in Fig. 9–14 has a mass of 90 kg and is holding 20 kg in his hands
(this increases 
to 
), then 
is increased to almost fo
