Humans, bears (shown in Figure 25.4a), and chickens are example of vertebrate omnivores; invertebrate omnivores include
cockroaches and crayfish (shown in Figure 25.4b).

Invertebrate Digestive Systems
Animals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the various foods they consume.
The simplest example is that of a gastrovascular cavity and is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion.
Platyhelminthes (flatworms), Ctenophora (comb jellies), and Cnidaria (coral, jelly fish, and sea anemones) use this type of
digestion. Gastrovascular cavities, as shown in Figure 25.5a, are typically a blind tube or cavity with only one opening, the
“mouth”, which also serves as an “anus”. Ingested material enters the m
