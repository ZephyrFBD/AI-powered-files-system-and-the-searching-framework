 are in the lower state, so the majority of incident pho-
tons will be absorbed. To obtain the coherent light from stimulated emission, two
conditions must be satisfied. First, the atoms must be excited to the higher state so
that an inverted population is produced in which more atoms are in the upper 
state than in the lower one (Fig. 28–17). Then emission of photons will dominate
over absorption. And second, the higher state must be a metastable state—a state
in which the electrons remain longer than usual† so that the transition to the lower
state occurs by stimulated emission rather than spontaneously.
Figure 28–18 is a schematic diagram of a laser: the “lasing” material is placed
in a long narrow tube at the ends of which are two mirrors, one of which is partially
transparent (transmitting perhaps 1 or 2%). Some of the excited atoms drop
down fairly soon after being excited. One of these is the blue atom shown on the far
left in Fig. 28–18. If the emitted photon strikes another at
