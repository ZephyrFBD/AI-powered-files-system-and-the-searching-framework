sistent with evolution, and since Darwin, our understanding has become clearer
and broader.
Fossils
Fossils provide solid evidence that organisms from the past are not the same as those found today, and fossils show a
progression of evolution. Scientists determine the age of fossils and categorize them from all over the world to determine

when the organisms lived relative to each other. The resulting fossil record tells the story of the past and shows the evolution
of form over millions of years (Figure 18.6). For example, scientists have recovered highly detailed records showing the
evolution of humans and horses.
Figure 18.6 In this (a) display, fossil hominids are arranged from oldest (bottom) to newest (top). As hominids evolved,
the shape of the skull changed. An artistâ€™s rendition of (b) extinct species of the genus Equus reveals that these ancient
species resembled the modern horse (Equus ferus) but varied in size.
