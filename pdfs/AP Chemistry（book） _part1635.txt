ble 10.3 that a and b generally 
increase with increasing molecular mass. Larger, more massive molecules have larger vol-
umes and tend to have greater intermolecular attractive forces.
Sample Exercise 10.15 
Using the van der Waals Equation
If 10.00 mol of an ideal gas were confined to 22.41 L at 0.0 Â°C, it would exert a pressure of 10.00 atm. Use the van der Waals 
equation and Table 10.3 to estimate the pressure exerted by 1.000 mol of Cl21g2 in 22.41 L at 0.0 Â°C.
SOLUTION
Analyze We need to determine a pressure. Because we will use the 
van der Waals equation, we must identify the appropriate values 
for the constants in the equation.
Plan Rearrange Equation 10.25 to isolate P.
Solve Substituting n = 10.00 mol, R = 0.08206 L@atm>mol@K,
T = 273.2 K, V = 22.41 L, a = 6.49 L2@atm>mol2, and 
b = 0.0562 L>mol:
