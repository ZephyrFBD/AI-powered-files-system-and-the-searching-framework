s effect is called total internal reflection.
Total internal reflection occurs only when light strikes a boundary where the
medium beyond has a lower index of refraction.
View up from under water. Describe
what a person would see who looked up at the world from beneath the perfectly
smooth surface of a lake or swimming pool.
RESPONSE For an air–water interface, the critical angle is given by
Therefore,
Thus the person would see the outside world compressed
into a circle whose edge makes a 49° angle with the vertical. Beyond this angle,
the person would see reflections from the sides and bottom of the lake or pool
(Fig. 23–27).
