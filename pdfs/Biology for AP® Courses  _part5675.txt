he child’s scream, terror
(low-vibrational frequencies), and take that energy back to power
the monster world. The lead character you might remember was a
single giant eye and the symbolism of the Cult’s all-seeing eye was
obvious. Every thought and emotion is broadcast as a frequency
unique to that thought and emotion. Feelings of love and joy,
empathy and compassion, are high, quick, frequencies while fear,
depression, anxiety, suﬀering and hate are low, slow, dense
frequencies. Which kind do you think Archontic consciousness can
connect with and absorb? In such a low and dense frequency state
there’s no way it can connect with the energy of love and joy.
Archons can only feed oﬀ energy compatible with their own
frequency and they and their Cult agents want to delete the human
world of love and joy and manipulate the transmission of low
vibrational frequencies through low-vibrational human mental and
emotional states. We are their energy source. Wars are energetic
banquets to the Arc
