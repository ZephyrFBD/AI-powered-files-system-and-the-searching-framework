hybrid

hydrophilic

hypertonic
Describes a fluid that has a higher osmotic pressure than another fluid it is
compared to; it exerts greater osmotic pull than the fluid on the other side
of a semipermeable membrane; hence, it possesses a greater
concentration of particles, and acquires water during osmosis
hypotonic
Describes a fluid that has a lower osmotic pressure than a fluid it is
compared to; it exerts lesser osmotic pull than the fluid on the other side
