ed between
generations did not seem consistent with the chemical
simplicity of the few nucleotides found in polymers of
deoxyribonucleic acids in comparison to the diversity of
protein polymers. Briefly explain:
•
the relationship between the structure of polymeric
DNA and the information stored
•
the relationship between the interactions between
base pairs on complementary strands of the double
helix and Chargaff’s observation on the relative
abundance of nucleotides in DNA
•
the meaning of the statement from the Nature
publication on the structure of DNA by Watson and
Crick: “It has not escaped our notice that the specific
pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a
possible copying mechanism for the genetic
material.”
72. In 1977, Fred Sanger developed a method to determine
the order of nucleotides in a strand of DNA. Sanger won a
Nobel Prize for his work, and his method of sequencing
based on dideoxy chain termination (Figure 14.8) has been
foundational to the rapid developme
