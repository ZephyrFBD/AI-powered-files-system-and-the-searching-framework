the “stress test”),
the patient walks on an inclined treadmill (Fig. 6–46).
Estimate the power required from a 75-kg patient when
the treadmill is sloping at an angle of 12° and the velocity
is 
(How does this power compare to the power
rating of a lightbulb?)

85. Water flows over a dam at the rate of 
and falls
vertically 88 m before striking the turbine blades. Calculate
(a) the speed of the water just before striking the turbine
blades (neglect air resistance), and (b) the rate at which
mechanical energy is transferred to the turbine blades,
assuming 55% efficiency.
86. A 55-kg skier starts from rest at the top of a ski jump,
point A in Fig. 6–48, and travels down the ramp. If fric-
tion and air resistance can be neglected, (a) determine her
speed 
when she reaches the horizontal end of the ramp
at B. (b) Determine the distance s to where she strikes the
ground at C.
