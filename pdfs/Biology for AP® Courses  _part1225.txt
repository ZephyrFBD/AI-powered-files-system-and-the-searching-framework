I, the homologous chromosomes are arranged in the center of the cell with the kinetochores facing
opposite poles. The homologous pairs orient themselves randomly at the equator. For example, if the two homologous
members of chromosome 1 are labeled a and b, then the chromosomes could line up a-b, or b-a. This is important in
determining the genes carried by a gamete, as each will only receive one of the two homologous chromosomes. Recall
that homologous chromosomes are not identical. They contain slight differences in their genetic information, causing each
gamete to have a unique genetic makeup.
This randomness is the physical basis for the creation of the second form of genetic variation in offspring. Consider
that the homologous chromosomes of a sexually reproducing organism are originally inherited as two separate sets, one
from each parent. Using humans as an example, one set of 23 chromosomes is present in the egg donated by the mother.
The father provides the other set of 23 chr
