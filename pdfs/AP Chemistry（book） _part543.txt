. For example, CH3COOH is extremely solu-
ble in water but is a weak electrolyte. Ca1OH22, in contrast, is not very soluble in water,

Do both, just one, or neither of the following solutions conduct 
electricity? If just one, which one?
(a) Ionic compounds like sodium chloride,
 
NaCl, form ions when they dissolve.
Na1
Cl2
Methanol
(b) Molecular substances like methanol,
 
CH3OH, dissolve without forming ions.
H2O molecules 
separate Na1 and Cl2 
ions from solid NaCl.
H2O molecules surround 
Na1 and Cl2 ions.
Na1 and Cl2 
ions disperse 
throughout the 
solution.

â–² Figure 4.3 Dissolution in water. (a) When an ionic compound, such as sodium chloride,  
NaCl, dissolves in water, H2O molecules separate, surround, and uniformly disperse the ions  
into the liquid. (b) Molecular substances that dissolve in water, such as methanol, CH3OH,  
usually do so without forming ions. We can think of methanol in water as a simple mixing of two  
molecular species. In both (a) and (b)
