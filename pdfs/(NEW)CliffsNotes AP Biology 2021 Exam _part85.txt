2. Ribosome subunits are manufactured in the nucleus and consist of RNA molecules and proteins. The two
subunits, labeled 60S and 40S, move across the nuclear envelope through nuclear pores and into the cytoplasm
where they are assembled into a single 80S ribosome. (An S value expresses how readily a product forms sediment
in a centrifuge, with larger values representing larger and heavier products.) In the cytoplasm, ribosomes assist in
the assembly of amino acids into proteins.

3. The endoplasmic reticulum, or ER, consists of stacks of flattened sacs that begin as an extension of the outer
bilayer of the nuclear envelope. In cross section, the ER appears as a series of maze-like channels, closely associated
with the nucleus. When ribosomes are present, the ER (called rough ER) creates glycoproteins by attaching
polysaccharide groups to polypeptides as they are assembled by the ribosomes. Smooth ER, without ribosomes, is
responsible for various activities, inc
