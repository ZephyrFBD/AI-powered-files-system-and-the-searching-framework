 limited the deer populations. The populations of other animal species and plant species increased, increasing
the biodiversity of the entire ecosystem. Wolves are a keystone species in the Yellowstone ecosystem. When a
keystone species is removed from an ecosystem, the ecosystem may be in danger of collapsing.
Disruptions to ecosystems can change the structure of the ecosystem or even lead to its demise. Invasive species
are species that are not native to a habitat. If an invasive species has no predators in a habitat, it can outcompete
native species in the area, leading to the extinction of the native species. Cane toads are an invasive species that were
introduced to Australia in the early 20th century in an effort to control the cane beetle, which was destroying
sugarcane crops. Unfortunately, cane toads have no natural predator in Australia and grew in numbers,
outcompeting the native species for food and habitats. In addition, cane toads are toxic when consumed by other
animals.
