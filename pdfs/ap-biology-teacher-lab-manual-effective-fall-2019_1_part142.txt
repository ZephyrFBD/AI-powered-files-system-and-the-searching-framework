■ Graphs 
A graph is a visual representation of your data, and you want your graph to be as clear 
as possible to the reader for interpretation. First, you have to decide whether to use a 
scatter plot in order to draw a “best fit” line through data points, a bar graph, or some 
other representation with appropriate units. Use a line graph if your data are continuous 
(e.g., the appearance of product over time in an enzyme reaction). If your data are 
discontinuous (e.g., the amount of water consumption in different high schools), use a 
bar graph. Your teacher might have other suggestions. 
A graph must have a title that informs the reader about the experiment. Labeling 
a graph as simply “Graph Number Four” doesn’t tell the reader anything about 
the experiment, or the results. In comparison, the title “The Effect of Different 
Concentrations of Auxin on Root Growth” tells the reader exactly what was being 
measured.
