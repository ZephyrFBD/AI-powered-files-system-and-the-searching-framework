hat the water from the tanks with two-species fish contained larger particles of DOC (and hence darker
water) than water with single-species fish. This increase in DOC blocked the sunlight and prevented algal
blooming. Conversely, the water from the single-species tank contained smaller DOC particles, allowing
more sunlight penetration to fuel the algal blooms.
This change in the environment, which is due to the different feeding habits of the stickleback species in
each lake type, probably has a great impact on the survival of other species in these ecosystems, especially
other photosynthetic organisms. Thus, the study shows that, at least in these ecosystems, the environment
and the evolution of populations have reciprocal effects that may now be factored into simulation models.

In the lake microcosms, why were algal blooms possible in the presence of one, but not
