 too may become pathogenic. In transduction, bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria, sometimes
also move short pieces of chromosomal DNA from one bacterium to another. Transduction results in a recombinant
organism. Archaea are not affected by bacteriophages but instead have their own viruses that translocate genetic material
from one individual to another. In conjugation, DNA is transferred from one prokaryote to another by means of a pilus,
which brings the organisms into contact with one another. The DNA transferred can be in the form of a plasmid or as a
hybrid, containing both plasmid and chromosomal DNA. These three processes of DNA exchange are shown in Figure
22.17.
Reproduction can be very rapid: a few minutes for some species. This short generation time coupled with mechanisms of
genetic recombination and high rates of mutation result in the rapid evolution of prokaryotes, allowing them to respond to
environmental changes (such as the introduction of an antibiotic)
