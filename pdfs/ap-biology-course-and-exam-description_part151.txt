Debate  
Students can read a case study about the genetics and evolution of skin color, then answer 
any questions that may accompany the case study. Alternately, teachers can provide 
appropriate questions and/or assignments to ensure that students understand the concepts 
addressed in the case study. Instead of answering the questions on paper, students can be 
divided into groups to debate possible answers to some or all of the questions. This activity 
can be augmented by having students read an article about the biology of skin color.
