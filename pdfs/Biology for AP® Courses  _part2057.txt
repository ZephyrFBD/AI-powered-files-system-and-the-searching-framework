 into the same region. The fact that a
species adapts after it comes into contact with a
competitor suggests that natural selection works
more quickly with higher selective pressures.
c.
An example of convergent evolution is the
development of an ancestral structure, a limb,
into two different modern structures, such as a
hand and a flipper. The fact that natural selection
can cause a structure to develop down two
different pathways due to different
environmental conditions supports the theory of
evolution
d.
An example of convergent evolution is the
development of the same function, flying, in
organisms that do not share a recent common
ancestry, such as insects and birds. The fact that
wings that allow flight have developed from
very different original structures suggests that
the process of natural selection can produce
similar adaptations in two very different types of
organisms who share a similar environment
