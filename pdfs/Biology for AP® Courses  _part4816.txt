ion with about 17,000 new species being
described each year. Estimates for the total number of species on Earth vary but are on the order of 10 million.
Biodiversity is negatively correlated with latitude for most taxa, meaning that biodiversity is higher in the tropics. The
mechanism for this pattern is not known with certainty, but several plausible hypotheses have been advanced.
Five mass extinctions with losses of more than 50 percent of extant species are observable in the fossil record.
Biodiversity recovery times after mass extinctions vary, but have been up to 30 million years. Recent extinctions are
recorded in written history and are the basis for one method of estimating contemporary extinction rates. The other method
