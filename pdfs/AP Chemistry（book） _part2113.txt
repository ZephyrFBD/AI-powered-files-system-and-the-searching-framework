Colloidal Motion in Liquids
We learned in Chapter 10 that gas molecules move at some average speed that 
depends inversely on their molar mass, in a straight line, until they collide with some-
thing. The mean free path is the average distance molecules travel between collisions. 
 (Section 10.8) Recall also that the kinetic-molecular theory of gases assumes that gas 
molecules are in continuous, random motion. 
 (Section 10.7)
Colloidal particles in a solution undergo random motion as a result of collisions 
with solvent molecules. Because the colloidal particles are massive in comparison with 
solvent molecules, their movements from any one collision are very tiny. However, 
there are many such collisions, and they cause a random motion of the entire colloidal 
particle, called
