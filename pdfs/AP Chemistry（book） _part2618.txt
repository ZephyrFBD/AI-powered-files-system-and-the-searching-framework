Although the form of the amino acid on the right in this equation 
is electrically neutral overall, it has a positively charged end and a 
negatively charged end. A molecule of this type is called a zwitterion 
(German for “hybrid ion”).
Do amino acids exhibit any properties indicating that they 
behave as zwitterions? If so, their behavior should be similar to that 
of ionic substances. 
 (Section 8.2) Crystalline amino acids have 
relatively high melting points, usually above 200 °C, which is charac-
teristic of ionic solids. Amino acids are far more soluble in water than 
in nonpolar solvents. In addition, the dipole moments of amino acids 
are large, consistent with a large separation of charge in the m
