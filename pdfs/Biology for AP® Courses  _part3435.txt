ne model of
animal evolution, the other superphylum, Protostomia,
includes fruit fly and nematode. In an alternative model,
insects are included with lancelet and human in a
superphylum called the Coelomata, and the nematode is
separate. Molecular studies of fruit fly, lancelet, human,
and nematode show that homologous genes, when present,
are strongly conserved. For example, the genes for the
receptors of germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF) and
retinoids, hormones that regulate cellular differentiation
during development, are present in each species.
Homologous genes for nuclear receptor estrogen and
thyroid hormone are present in lancelet and human but
missing in nematode and fruit fly. Genes for the vitamin D
receptor are absent in fruit fly but are present in the other
species.
Many neuropeptide hormones found in human, fruit fly
and nematode such as GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing
hormone) and the gonadotropins luteinizing and follicle
stimulating hormones (LH and FSH) have not been foun
