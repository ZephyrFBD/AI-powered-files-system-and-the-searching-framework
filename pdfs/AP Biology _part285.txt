ranslocation—when a fragment of a chromosome becomes
attached to a nonhomologous chromosome
Polyploidy—when a cell or organism has extra sets of
chromosomes
NONDISJUNCTION
Nondisjunction is an error that sometimes occurs during meiosis in which
homologous chromosomes fail to separate as they should. See Figure 8.11.
When this happens, one gamete receives two of the same type of
chromosome and another gamete receives no copy. The remaining
chromosomes may be unaffected and normal. If either aberrant gamete
unites with a normal gamete during fertilization, the resulting zygote will
have an abnormal number of chromosomes. Any abnormal number of
chromosomes is known as aneuploidy. If a chromosome is present in
triplicate, the condition is known as trisomy. People with Down syndrome
have an extra chromosome 21. The condition is referred to as trisomy 21.
Cancer cells grown in culture almost always have extra chromosomes. An
organism in which the cells have an extra set of chromosomes is ref
