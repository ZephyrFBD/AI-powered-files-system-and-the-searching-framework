rgent and divergent evolution.) Similarities among organisms stem either from shared ancestral
history (homologies) or from separate evolutionary paths (analogies). Cladograms are constructed by using shared derived
traits to distinguish different groups of species from one another. For example, lizards, rabbits and humans all descended
from a common ancestor that had an amniotic egg; thus, lizards, rabbits, and humans all belong to the same clade.
Vertebrata is a larger clade that also includes fish, lamprey, and lancelets. The closer two species or groups are located
to each on a phylogenetic tree or cladogram, they more recently they shared a common ancestor. With the influx of
new information, scientists can revise phylogenetic trees; for example, computer programs, such as one called BLAST,
which helps determine relatedness using DNA sequencing. Typically, a phylogenetic tree is constructed with the simplest
explanation of evolutionary history (maximum parsimony) and the fewest nu
