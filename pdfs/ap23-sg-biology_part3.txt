(a) 
Describe the effect the addition of a charged phosphate group can have on a protein that 
would cause the protein to become inactive.  
• 
It changes the structure/shape of the protein. 
1 point 
 
 
 Explain how a signal can be amplified during signal transduction in a pathway such as the 
PHO signaling pathway. 
• 
Each enzyme (in a signal transduction pathway) can act on many copies of a protein.
