Figure 22.5 Deinococcus radiodurans, visualized in this false color transmission electron micrograph, is a prokaryote
that can tolerate very high doses of ionizing radiation. It has developed DNA repair mechanisms that allow it to
reconstruct its chromosome even if it has been broken into hundreds of pieces by radiation or heat. (credit: modification

Prokaryotes in the Dead Sea
One example of a very harsh environment is the Dead Sea, a hypersaline basin that is located between Jordan and Israel.
Hypersaline environments are essentially concentrated seawater. In the Dead Sea, the sodium concentration is 10 times
higher than that of seawater, and the water contains high levels of magnesium (about 40 times higher
