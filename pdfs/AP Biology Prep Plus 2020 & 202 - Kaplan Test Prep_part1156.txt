f Group 1 lemurs are more genetically similar to
another group, that would suggest they recently split from that group
rather than Group 2, making (C) correct.
35. C
Common causes of disease transmission through microorganisms, such as
bacteria and viruses, contain DNA and/or RNA. The absence of DNA/RNA
gene signatures from known and potential pathogens suggests that if the
pathogen is in fact present in the soil, its transmission must not involve
nucleic acids. Prions are misfolded proteins that can transmit a disease
independently of any genetic material. Thus, the scientist’s methods
wouldn’t detect their presence, but their hypothesis would still be correct,
so you can choose (C). (A) is incorrect because it distorts the original
hypothesis, which stated it was transmitted via the soil. (B) is incorrect
because bacteria have DNA, and no DNA was detected. (D) is incorrect
because viruses and bacteria aren’t the only possible causes of disease,
and prions would be an alternative expl
