Polaroids (Polarization by Absorption)
Plane-polarized light can be obtained from unpolarized light using certain crystals
such as tourmaline. Or, more commonly, we use a Polaroid sheet. (Polaroid materials
were invented in 1929 by Edwin Land.) A Polaroid sheet consists of long complex
molecules arranged parallel to one another. Such a Polaroid acts like a series of 
parallel slits to allow one orientation of polarization to pass through nearly 
undiminished. This direction is called the transmission axis of the Polaroid. Polariza-
tion perpendicular to this direction is absorbed almost completely by the Polaroid.
Absorption by a Polaroid can be explained at the molecular level. An electric
field 
that oscillates parallel to the long molecules can set electrons into motion
along the molecules, thus doing work on them and transferring energy. Hence, if 
is parallel to the mol
