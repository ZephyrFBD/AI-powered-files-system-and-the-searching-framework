onsider. Genetic discrimination occurs when people are treated unfairly because
of actual or perceived differences in their genetic information that may cause or increase the risk of developing a
disorder or disease. For example, a health insurer might refuse to give coverage to an individual who has a genetic
difference that raises their odds of getting cancer. Many G7 countries protect genetic test information to help
eliminate genetic discrimination and safeguard individualsâ€™ genetic privacy.
