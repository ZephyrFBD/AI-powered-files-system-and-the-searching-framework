cible
(positive) and repressible (negative) systems is the lac (lactose) operon in
E. coli, which is required to transport and metabolize lactose for carbon
and energy. An operon is a series of genes (including a promoter, an
operator, and a terminator) that synchronize to perform a biological
function. The following diagram shows that when lactose is not present in
the growth medium, a protein repressor binds to the operator (regulatory
site) to inhibit the transcription of the operon. When lactose (the inducer)
is present, it binds to the repressor. The release of the repressor from the
operator causes the transcription of the operon by RNA polymerase to
commence. The transcribed mRNA codes for the proteins that metabolize
lactose, which eventually leads to the removal of lactose from the
medium. When lactose is gone, the repressor binds to the operator again
and the operon is back to square one. This is a classic example of a
negative feedback loop. AÈ‡er all, there is no need for th
