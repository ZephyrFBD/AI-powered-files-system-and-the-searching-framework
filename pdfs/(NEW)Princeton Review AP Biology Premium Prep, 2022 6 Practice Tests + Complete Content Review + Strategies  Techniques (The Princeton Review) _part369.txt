7. A researcher uses molecular biology techniques to insert a human lysosomal membrane protein into bacterial
cells to produce large quantities of this protein for later study. However, only small quantities of this protein
result in these cells. What is a possible explanation for this result?
(A) The membrane protein requires processing in the ER and Golgi, which are missing in the bacterial cells.
(B) Bacteria do not make membrane proteins.
(C) Bacteria do not use different transcription factors than humans, so the gene was not expressed.
(D) Bacteria do not have enough tRNAs to make this protein sequence.
