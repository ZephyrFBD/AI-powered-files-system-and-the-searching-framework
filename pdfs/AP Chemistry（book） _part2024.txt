The Effect of Intermolecular Forces on Solution Formation
Any of the intermolecular forces discussed in Chapter 11 can operate between solute and 
solvent particles in a solution. These forces are summarized in Figure 13.2. Dispersion 
forces, for example, dominate when one nonpolar substance, such as C7H16, dissolves in 
another, such as C5H12, and ion–dipole forces dominate in solutions of ionic substances 
in water.
Three kinds of intermolecular interactions are involved in solution formation:
1. Solute–solute interactions between solute particles must be overcome to disperse the 
solute particles through the solvent.
2. Solvent–solvent interactions between solvent particles must be overcome to make 
room for the solute particles in the solvent.
3. Solvent–solute interactions between the solvent and solute particles occur as the par-
ticles mix.
The extent to which one substance is able
