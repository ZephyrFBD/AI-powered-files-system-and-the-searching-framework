is consumes
carbon dioxide, so the vial without foil will not build up as much carbon dioxide and will have a higher pH than
the vial covered in foil. Choice (A) is incorrect because the vial without foil will perform both cellular
respiration and photosynthesis. The vial covered with foil will not perform photosynthesis, so choices (C) and
(D) are incorrect.
23. (D) According to the table, the largest animals have lower cancer rates, so the data do not support the claim that
larger animals have greater cancer rates. Choices (A) and (C) are incorrect because larger animals have lower
cancer rates. Smaller animals have higher cancer rates than larger animals, so choice (B) is incorrect.
24. (A) Elephants have lower cancer rates than marmosets, Tasmanian devils, or tigers, so elephants are more
likely to have more copies of the tumor-suppressing TP53 gene. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because
marmosets, Tasmanian devils, and tigers all have higher cancer rates than elephants.
