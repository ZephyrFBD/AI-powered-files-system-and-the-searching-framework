rteries (which are each named based on the region of the kidney they pass through)
and ends with the exiting of the renal veins to join the inferior vena cava. The renal arteries split into several segmental
arteries upon entering the kidneys. Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal
columns, which supply the renal lobes. The interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the
arcuate arteries. The arcuate “bow shaped” arteries form arcs along the base of the medullary pyramids. Cortical radiate
arteries, as the name suggests, radiate out from the arcuate arteries. The cortical radiate arteries branch into numerous
afferent arterioles, and then enter the capillaries supplying the nephrons. Veins trace the path of the arteries and have similar
names, except there are no segmental veins.
As mentioned previously, the functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, illustrated in Figure 32.7. Each kidney is m
