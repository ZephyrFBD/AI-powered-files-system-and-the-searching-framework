is a constant function about
space, which means the temperature of every point is

2.2.8 Further discussion
The position of the faucet and overflow drain only affects the process of adding
water in the whole loop. When the overflow drain is in the opposite side of the faucet,
it starts to drain away the water the moment the user adds water into the bathtub and
all the water drained away is the cold water without heat exchange with the adding
water.

However, when the overflow drain is in t
