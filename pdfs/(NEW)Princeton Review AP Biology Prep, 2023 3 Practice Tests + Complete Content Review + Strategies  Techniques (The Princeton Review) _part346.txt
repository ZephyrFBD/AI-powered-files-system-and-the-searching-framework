ique three-dimensional structure that resembles
a four-leaf clover:
One end of the tRNA carries an amino acid. The other end, called an anticodon, has three nitrogenous bases that can
complementarily base pair with the codon in the mRNA. Usually, the normal rules of base pairing are set in stone,
but tRNA anti​codons can be a bit flexible when they bind with a codon on an mRNA, especially the third nucleotide
in an anticodon. The third position is said to experience wobble pairing. Things that don’t normally bind will pair
up, like guanine and uracil.
Transfer RNAs are the “go-betweens” in protein synthesis. Each tRNA becomes charged and enzymatically attaches
to an amino acid in the cell’s cytoplasm and “shuttles” it to the ribosome. The charging enzymes involved in
forming the bond between each amino acid and tRNA require ATP.
Translation also involves three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. Initiation begins when a ribosome
attaches to the mRNA.
