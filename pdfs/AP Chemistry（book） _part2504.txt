was used to illustrate Beer’s law in Chapter 14 (Figure 14.5). The reac-
tion can be monitored using visible-light spectroscopy because I2 has 
a violet color while H2 and HI are colorless. At 300 K, the equilibrium 
constant for the reaction H21g2 + I21g2 ∆ 2 HI1g2 is Kc = 794. 
To answer the following questions assume you have access to hydro-
gen, iodine, hydrogen iodide, a transparent reaction vessel, a visible- 
light spectrometer, and a means for changing the temperature. 
(a) Which gas or gases concentration could you readily moni-
tor with the spectrometer? (b) To use Beer’s law (Equation 14.5) 
you need to determine the extinction coefficient, e, for the sub-
stance in question. How would you determine e? (c) Describe an 
experiment for determining the equilibrium constant at 600 K. 
 
(d) Use the bond enthalpies in Table 8.4 to estimate the enthalpy 
of this reaction. (e) Based on your answer to part (d), would you 
expect Kc at 600 K to be larger or smaller than at 300 K?
