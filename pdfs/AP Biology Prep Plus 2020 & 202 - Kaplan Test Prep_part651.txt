7. Researchers have studied how genetic variants of Arabidopsis
thaliana respond to infection by vascular wilt fungus. The figure
below shows the fraction of susceptible, intermediate, and
resistant plants in four diﬀerent genetic variations. The trait does
not appear to be explained by Mendelian models of inheritance.
A researcher produces 240 seedlings from line Axr2.1. Based on
this information and the figure above, how many of the seedlings
would possess at least some level of resistance to vascular wilt
fungus?
