pe asci have 
four black and four tan spores in a row (4:4 pattern), as shown in Figure 9. Recombinant 
asci will not have this pattern (Figure 10).

■ Prelab Questions 
Assign the following questions as homework or as group discussion questions. 
•  How do you explain the differences between the recombinant asci and   
the parental types?  
•  What meiotic event can account for this difference? 
•  Using the model chromosomes from Part 4, predict the possible meiotic outcomes.

perithecia, wild type X tan cross   
(one plate per 4–6 students)
