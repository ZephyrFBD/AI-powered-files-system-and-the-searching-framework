You’ll notice that we needed a little energy to get us going. That’s because chemical bonds must be broken before
new bonds can form. This energy barrier—the hump in the graph—is called the activation energy. Once a set of
reactants has reached its activation energy, the rest of the reaction is all downhill. Reaching the transition state is the
tough part.
ENZYMES
A catalyst is something that speeds something up. Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up reactions. They
accomplish this by lowering the activation energy and helping the transition state to form. Thus, the reaction can
occur more quickly because the tricky transition state is not as much of a hurdle to overcome. Enzymes do NOT
change the energy of the starting point or the ending point of the reaction. They only lower the activation energy.
Enzyme Specificity
Most of the crucial reactions that occur in the cell require enzymes. Yet enzymes themselves are highly specific—in
fact, each enzyme catalyze
