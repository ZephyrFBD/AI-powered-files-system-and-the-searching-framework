species, repeatedly, as long as the population survives or until the organism becomes extinct.
Figure 18.13 The only illustration in Darwin's On the Origin of Species is (a) a diagram showing speciation events
leading to biological diversity. The diagram shows similarities to phylogenetic charts that are drawn today to illustrate
the relationships of species. (b) Modern elephants evolved from the Palaeomastodon, a species that lived in Egypt
35â€“50 million years ago.
For speciation to occur, two new populations must be formed from one original population and they must evolve in such
a way that it becomes impossible for individuals from the two new populations to interbreed. Biologists have proposed
mechanisms by which this could occur that fall into two broad categories. Allopatric speciation (allo- = "other"; -patric
= "homeland") involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution. Sympatric
speciation (sym- = "same"; -patric = "homeland") i
