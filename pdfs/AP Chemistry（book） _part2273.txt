▶Practice Exercise 1
Consider the following hypothetical reaction:
2 P + Q ¡ 2 R + S. The following mechanism is proposed 
for this reaction:
P + P ∆
 
 T (fast)
Q + T ¡  R + U  1slow2
  
   U ¡ R + S  1fast2
Substances T and U are unstable intermediates. What rate law 
is predicted by this mechanism?
(a) Rate = k3P42 (b) Rate = k3P43Q4 (c) Rate = k3P423Q4  
(d) Rate = k3P43Q42 (e) Rate = k3U4

The sum of Equations 14.32 and 14.33 is just Equation 14.31, a result that you can check 
for yourself.
When the H2O2 has been completely decomposed, we are left with a colorless 
solution of Br -1aq2, which means that this ion is indeed a catalyst of the reaction 
because it speeds up the
