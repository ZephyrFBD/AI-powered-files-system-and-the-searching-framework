effect of the lower solute potential of the surrounding sodium chloride solution on the dandelion
cells. Therefore, choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) incorrectly states that the water potential in the dandelion
cells would be lower than that of the NaCl solution.
Short Free-Response
11. (a) If the water potential of the surrounding solution was higher than that of the paramecium, more water would
enter the parameciumâ€™s cell and the contractile vacuole would have to pump more often to remove the
excess water from the cell.
(b) The independent variable is the concentration of the salt solution. The dependent variable is the number of
contractions of the contractile vacuole per minute.
(c) The contractile vacuole would have to pump more times per minute to remove the excess water.
(d) Distilled water would have a higher water potential than P. aurelia. So more water would move into the
paramecium and the contractile vacuole would have to work harder to remove the excess water.
