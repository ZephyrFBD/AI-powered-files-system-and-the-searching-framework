rse process to occur.

(a) This process is spontaneous. Whenever two objects at differ-
ent temperatures are brought into contact, heat is transferred 
from the hotter object to the colder one. 
 (Section 5.1)  
Thus, heat is transferred from the hot metal to the cooler 
water. The final temperature, after the metal and water 
achieve the same temperature (thermal equilibrium), will 
be somewhere between the initial temperatures of the metal 
and the water. 
(b) Experience tells us that this process is not spontaneous— 
we certainly have never seen hydrogen and oxygen 
gases spontaneously bubbling up out of water! Rather, 
the reverse process—the reaction of H2 and O2 to form 
H2O¬is spontaneous. 
(c)  The normal boiling point is the temperature at which a 
vapor at 1 atm is in equilibrium with its liquid. Thus, this 
is an equilibrium situation. If the temperature were below 
80.1 °C, condensation would be spontaneous.
