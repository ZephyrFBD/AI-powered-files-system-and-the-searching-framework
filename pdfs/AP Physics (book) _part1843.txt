n the height of the cliff and the mass m of the
rock. A large rock and a small rock can be at the same height h (Fig. 17–3a) and
thus have the same “gravitational potential,” but the larger rock has the greater
potential energy (it has more mass). The electrical case is similar (Fig. 17–3b):
the potential energy change, or the work that can be done, depends both on the
potential difference (corresponding to the height of the cliff) and on the charge
(corresponding to mass), Eq. 17–3. But note a significant difference: electric
charge comes in two types,
and 
whereas gravitational mass is always 
Sources of electrical energy such as batteries and electric generators are meant
to maintain a potential difference. The actual amount of energy transformed by
such a device depends on how much charge flows, as well as the potential dif-
ference (Eq. 17–3). For example, consider an automobile headlight connected 
to a 12.0-V battery. The amount of energy transformed (into light and thermal
