n, Eq. 31–7, for the proton–proton chain in
the Sun, the neutrinos escape from the Sun with energy of
about 0.5 MeV. The remaining energy, 26.2 MeV, is available
to heat the Sun. Use this value to calculate the “heat of
combustion” per kilogram of hydrogen fuel and compare it
to the heat of combustion of coal, about 
63. Energy reaches Earth from the Sun at a rate of about
Calculate (a) the total power output of the
Sun, and (b) the number of protons consumed per second in
the reaction of Eq. 31–7, assuming that this is the source of
all the Sun’s energy. (c) Assuming that the Sun’s mass of
was originally all protons and that all could be
involved in nuclear reactions in the Sun’s core, how long
would you expect the Sun to “glow” at its present rate? See
Problem 62. [Hint: Use 
law.]
