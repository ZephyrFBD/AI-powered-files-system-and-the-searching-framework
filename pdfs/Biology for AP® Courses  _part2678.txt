s, plants have the ability to detect and respond to environmental change; this ability is an
adaptation favored by natural selection. Flowering plants react to light, gravity, infection by pathogens, drought, and, as
with the Venus flytrap, touch. Animals have two systems on which they can rely to detect and respond to stimuli: the
nervous and endocrine systems. Plants, however, only have chemical control mechanisms at their disposal. In addition to
the phytochromes, plants evolved hormones that allow them to respond to environmental changes. Like animal hormones,
plant hormones are chemical signaling molecules that trigger a cellular response through a signal transduction pathway.
Although you do not have to memorize a laundry list of plant hormones and their activities, you should understand the
basic mechanism of how they trigger a response. Examples that weâ€™ll learn about in this chapter include auxins, which
cause plant stems to grow and bend toward light, and gibberellins, which
