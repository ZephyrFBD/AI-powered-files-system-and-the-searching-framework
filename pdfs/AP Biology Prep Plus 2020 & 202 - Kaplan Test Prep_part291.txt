low within 5 meters, as
well as smaller amounts of gene flow at greater distances. Though the
percentages are not huge, they are large enough to have an impact on
the frequency of the herbicide resistance trait, especially if the
application of herbicide provides a selective pressure. Therefore, (C) is
correct. (A) is incorrect because even a small percentage of gene flow
can have a significant eﬀect, especially when the selective pressure of
a herbicide is present. (B) is incorrect because the researchers planted
seeds with the herbicide resistance genes, so it is already clear that
such genes can be found in both pollen and seeds. (D) is incorrect
because the trait can spread over large distances given enough time
and the appropriate selective pressure.

As water moves through pores from one cell to another, the size of the
pores limits which dissolved materials can pass through. In this way,
the tissue acts as a filter. Because they contain more cells,
gy
