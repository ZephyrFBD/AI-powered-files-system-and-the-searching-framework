applied to human genetics. When a female parent is homozygous for a recessive X-
linked trait, she will pass the trait on to 100 percent of her offspring. Her male offspring are, therefore, destined to express
the trait, as they will inherit their father's Y chromosome. In humans, the alleles for certain conditions (some forms of color
blindness, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy) are X-linked. Females who are heterozygous for these diseases are said to
be carriers and may not exhibit any phenotypic effects. These females will pass the disease to half of their sons and will pass

carrier status to half of their daughters; therefore, recessive X-linked traits appear more frequently in males than females.
In some groups of organisms with sex chromosomes, the sex with the non-homologous sex chromosomes is the female
rather than the male. This is the case for a
