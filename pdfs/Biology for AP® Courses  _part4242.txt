ear. The channel (the width of the river or
stream) is narrower than at any other place along the length of the river or stream. Because of this, the current is often faster
here than at any other point of the river or stream.
The fast-moving water results in minimal silt accumulation at the bottom of the river or stream; therefore, the water is
clear. Photosynthesis here is mostly attributed to algae that are growing on rocks; the swift current inhibits the growth of
phytoplankton. An additional input of energy can come from leaves or other organic material that falls into the river or
stream from trees and other plants that border the water. When the leaves decompose, the organic material and nutrients
in the leaves are returned to the water. Plants and animals have adapted to this fast-moving water. For instance, leeches
(phylum Annelida) have elongated bodies and suckers on both ends. These suckers attach to the substrate, keeping the leech
anchored in place. Freshwater trout speci
