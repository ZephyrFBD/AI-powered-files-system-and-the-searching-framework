d proteins, thus changing the activities within the cell.
Blood clotting provides an example of the role of the extracellular matrix in cell communication. When the cells lining a
blood vessel are damaged, they display a protein receptor called tissue factor. When tissue factor binds with another factor
in the extracellular matrix, it causes platelets to adhere to the wall of the damaged blood vessel, stimulates the adjacent
smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel to contract (thus constricting the blood vessel), and initiates a series of steps that
stimulate the platelets to produce clotting factors.
Intercellular Junctions
Cells can also communicate with each other via direct contact, referred to as intercellular junctions. There are some
differences in the ways that plant and animal cells do this. Plasmodesmata are junctions between plant cells, whereas animal
cell contacts include tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.
Plasmodesmata
In general, long stretches of the plasma
