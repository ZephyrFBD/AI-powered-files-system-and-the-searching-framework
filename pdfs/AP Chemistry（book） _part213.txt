mposition, also called the law of definite 
proportions, states that the elemental composition of a pure compound 
is always the same. Most matter consists of a mixture of substances. Mix-
tures have variable compositions and can be either homogeneous or het-
erogeneous; homogeneous mixtures are called solutions.
PROPERTIES OF MATTER (SECTION 1.3) Each substance has a 
unique set of physical properties and chemical properties that can be 
used to identify it. During a physical change, matter does not change 
its composition. Changes of state are physical changes. In a chemical 
change (chemical reaction), a substance is transformed into a chemically 
different substance. Intensive properties are independent of the amount 
of matter examined and are used to identify substances. Extensive prop-
erties relate to the amount of substance present. Differences in physical 
and chemical properties are used to separate substances.
THE NATURE OF ENERGY (SECTION 1.4) Energy is defined as the
