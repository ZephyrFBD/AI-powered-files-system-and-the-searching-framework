hat biological systems 
depend on relationships that, when 
compromised, can have far-reaching 
consequences within the system. These 
consequences can sometimes be 
deleterious for cells, organisms, and even 
ecosystems. This understanding will help 
students make and justify predictions about 
how the changes in a biological system 
affect its function. 
On the exam, students tend to struggle with 
the use of language and similar terms, for 
example, protein versus proton. This confusion 
often results in a failure to earn points on free-
response questions. T
eachers should hold 
students accountable for the proper use of 
appropriate terms throughout the course.
Developing Understanding 
This first unit sets the foundation for students to understand the chemical basis of life, which 
is needed for mastery of future areas of focus and provides students with a survey of the 
elements necessary for carbon-based systems to function. Students learn that water and
