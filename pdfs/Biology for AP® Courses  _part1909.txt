enetic mutation was found, which showed him to be at risk for sudden heart attack. He was also predicted to have a 23
percent risk of developing prostate cancer and a 1.4 percent risk of developing Alzheimerâ€™s. The scientists used databases
and several publications to analyze the genomic data. Even though genomic sequencing is becoming more affordable and
analytical tools are becoming more reliable, ethical issues surrounding genomic analysis at a population level remain to be
addressed.
Figure 17.14 PCA3 is a gene that is expressed in prostate epithelial cells and overexpressed in cancerous cells.
A high concentration of PCA3 in urine is indicative of prostate cancer. The PCA3 test is considered to be a better
indicator of cancer than the more well know PSA test, which measures the level of PSA (prostate-specific antigen)
in the blood.
In 2011, the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommended against using the PSA test to screen healthy
men for prostate cancer. Their rec
