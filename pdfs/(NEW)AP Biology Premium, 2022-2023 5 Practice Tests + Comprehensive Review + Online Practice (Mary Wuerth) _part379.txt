be antiparallel to the given DNA sequence, so it would start with the 5′ end.
Also, in RNA, uracil replaces thymine, and the other base-pairing rules are the same as those found in DNA.
Choices (A) and (B) are incorrect because the mRNA is not antiparallel to the DNA sequence. Choices (A) and
(C) are incorrect because they contain thymine, which does not appear in RNA.
4. (B) The mRNA transcribed from the DNA sequence in the problem would be 5′ UUA GCA AAG UUA GUU
3′. Using Figure 16.4, the amino acid sequence that would be translated from that mRNA would be Leu-Ala-
Lys-Leu-Val.
5. (D) Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes use RNA polymerase for transcription. Only eukaryotes have alternative
splicing of exons and the addition of a 3′ poly-A tail and a 5′ GTP cap to mRNA, so choices (A), (B), and (C)
are incorrect.
6. (C) Introns are removed from the pre-mRNA to help form the mature mRNA, which is represented by step 3.
Step 1 represents DNA replication, so choice (A) is incorrect. Transcri
