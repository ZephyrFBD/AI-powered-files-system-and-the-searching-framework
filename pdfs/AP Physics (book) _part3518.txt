A nuclear reaction occurs when two nuclei collide and two or
more other nuclei (or particles) are produced. In this process,
as in radioactivity, transmutation (change) of elements occurs.

In fission, a heavy nucleus such as uranium splits into two
intermediate-sized nuclei after being struck by a neutron.
is
fissionable by slow neutrons, whereas some fissionable nuclei
require fast neutrons. Much energy is released in fission
per fission) because the binding energy per
nucleon is lower for heavy nuclei than it is for intermediate-
sized nuclei, so the mass of a heavy nucleus is greater than the
total mass of its fission products. The fission process releases
neutrons, so that a chain reaction is possible. The critical mass
is the minimum mass of fuel needed so that enough emitted
neutrons go on to produce more fissions and sustain a chain
reaction. In a nuclear reactor or nuclear weapon, a moderator
is used to slo
