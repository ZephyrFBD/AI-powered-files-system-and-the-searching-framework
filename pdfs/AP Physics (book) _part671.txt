41. (II) Chris jumps off a bridge with a bungee cord (a heavy
stretchable cord) tied around his ankle, Fig. 6–42. He falls
for 15 m before the bungee cord begins to stretch. Chris’s
mass is 75 kg and we assume the cord obeys Hooke’s law,
with  
If we neglect air resistance,
estimate what distance d below the bridge Chris’s foot will
be before coming to a stop. Ignore the mass of the cord
(not realistic, however) and treat Chris as a particle.
