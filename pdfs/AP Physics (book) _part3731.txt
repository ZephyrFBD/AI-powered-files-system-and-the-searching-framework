The Expanding Universe: Redshift and Hubble’s Law

FIGURE 33–21 Simplified model of
a 2-dimensional universe, imagined
as a balloon. As you blow up the
balloon 
the
wavelength of a wave on its surface
gets longer (redshifted).

Expansion, and the Cosmological Principle
What does it mean that distant galaxies are all moving away from us, and with
ever greater speed the farther they are from us? It seems to suggest some kind of
explosive expansion that started at some very distant time in the past. And at
first sight we seem to be in the middle of it all. But we aren’t. The expansion
appears the same from any other point in the universe. To understand why, see
Fig. 33–22. In Fig. 33–22a we have the view from Earth (or from our Galaxy).
The velocities of surrounding galaxies are indicated by arrows, pointing away
from us
