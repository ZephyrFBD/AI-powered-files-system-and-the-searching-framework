fluenced by genetic diversity. 
Species and populations with little genetic 
diversity are at risk of decline or extinction. 
b. Genetically diverse populations are more

environmental pressure.
c. Alleles that are adaptive in one environmental 
condition may be deleterious in another 
because of different selective pressures.
