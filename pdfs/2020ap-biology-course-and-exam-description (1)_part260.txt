 teachers may prefer to augment a textbook with 
journal articles and/or abstracts from the scientific 
literature. Students may find it useful to analyze primary 
source material regularly to deepen their understanding 
of the key concepts addressed by the textbook and 
to apply the science practices. While an increasing 
number of textbooks include primary source material, 
it is still important to introduce students to a wide 
variety of materials in order to provide opportunities 
to analyze data from diverse sources. These sources 
should include data tables, charts, graphs, and 
diagrams. You may also use the ancillary materials and 
website resources that accompany recently published 
textbooks to find quality materials to supplement 
classroom instruction.
Note: Lab manuals and other materials are also 
essential for AP Biology and are discussed on  
pages 167–168.
