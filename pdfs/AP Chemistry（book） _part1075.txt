A Closer look Effective Nuclear Charge
because the more diffuse core electron cloud is less able to screen the valence electrons 
from the nuclear charge. In the case of the alkali metals, Zeff increases from 1.3+ for lith-
ium, to 2.5+ for sodium, to 3.5+ for potassium.
Give It Some Thought
Which would you expect to experience a greater effective nuclear charge, a 2p 
electron of a Ne atom or a 3s electron of a Na atom? 
7.3 ∣ Sizes of Atoms and Ions
It is tempting to think of atoms as hard, spherical objects. According to the quantum- 
mechanical model, however, atoms do not have sharply defined boundaries at which the 
electron distribution becomes zero. 
 (Section 6.5) Nevertheless, we can define atomic 
size in several ways, based on the distances between atoms in various situations.

Imagine a collection of argon atoms in the gas phase. When two of these atoms collide, 
they ricochet apart like colliding billiar
