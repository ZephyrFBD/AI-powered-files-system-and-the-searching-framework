s, and plays a 
role in intracellular transport.
b. Mitochondrial double membrane provides 
compartments for different metabolic reactions.
c.	Lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes, 
which are important in intracellular digestion, 
the recycling of a cell’s organic materials, and 
programmed cell death (apoptosis).
d. Vacuoles have many roles, including storage 
and release of macromolecules and cellular 
waste products. In plants, it aids in retention 
of water for turgor pressure.
