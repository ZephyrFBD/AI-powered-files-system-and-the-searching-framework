2. Which is the most likely cause of an error during meiosis that
results in daughter cells with an incorrect number of
chromosomes?
Displacement of sister chromatids to opposite poles of the
dividing cell
(A)
Recombination of genetic material during the earlier stages
of meiosis
(B)
Activation of the securin proteins that separate chromatids
during anaphase II
(C)
Nondisjunction of the genetic material at any point during
meiosis
(D)
3. Certain cell types may become senescent, meaning that they no
longer divide. A simple example of this phenomenon can be found
in skin cells, which originate from live progenitor cells beneath the
surface layers of skin. Progenitor cells will undergo a simple
mitotic division in which one daughter cell remains anchored to
the basilar membrane, while the other daughter cell travels
toward the surface of the skin and ceases to undergo further
mitotic divisions. How do the genetic contents of these two
daughter cells compare?
