14. The pyloric sphincter controls the flow of the contents of the stomach (chyme) into the small intestine. The
pyloric sphincter prevents the acidic chyme from the stomach from entering the small intestine until the
pancreas is ready to secrete bicarbonate into the small intestine, which neutralizes the acids in the chyme. If the
pyloric sphincter was damaged and could not control the flow of chyme into the small intestine, which
enzymes would most likely have reduced activity during digestion?
(A) amylase and pepsin
(B) pepsin and lipase
(C) lipase and trypsin
(D) trypsin and amylase
15. Which of the following processes occurs in anaerobic prokaryotes?
