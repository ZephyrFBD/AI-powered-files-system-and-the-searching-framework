ng to the Moon, astronauts aboard the
Apollo spacecraft put the spacecraft into a slow rotation to
distribute the Sunâ€™s energy evenly (so one side would not
become too hot). At the start of their trip, they accelerated
from no rotation to 1.0 revolution every minute during a 
12-min time interval. Think of the spacecraft as a cylinder 
with a diameter of 8.5 m rotating about its cylindrical axis.
Determine (a) the angular acceleration, and (b) the radial
and tangential components of the linear acceleration of a
point on the skin of the ship 6.0 min after it started this
acceleration.
16. (II) A turntable of radius 
is turned by a circular rubber
roller of radius 
in contact with it at their outer edges.
What is the ratio of their angular velocities,
8;2 and 8;3 Constant Angular Acceleration; Rolling
17. (I) An automobile engine slows down from 3500 rpm to
1200 rpm in 2.5 s. Calculate (a) its angular acceleration,
assumed constant, and (b) the total number of revolutions
the engine make
