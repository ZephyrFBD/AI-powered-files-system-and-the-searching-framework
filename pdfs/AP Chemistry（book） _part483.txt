ulated by using Equation 3.14  to com-
pare the given actual yield (33.5 g) with the theoretical yield.
Check We can check our answer in (a) by doing a ballpark calcula-
tion. From the balanced equation we know that each mole of cy-
clohexane gives 1 mol adipic acid. We have 25>84 â‰ˆ25>75 = 0.3 
mol hexane, so we expect 0.3 mol adipic acid, which equals about 
0.3 * 150 = 45 g, about the same magnitude as the 43.5 g  
obtained in the more detailed calculation given previously. In 
 
addition, our answer has the appropriate units and number of sig-
nificant figures. In (b) the answer is less than 100%, as it must be 
from the definition of percent yield.

(b) The percent yield is: 
Percent yield =
actual yield
theoretical yield * 100% =
33.5 g
43.5 g * 100% = 77.0%
