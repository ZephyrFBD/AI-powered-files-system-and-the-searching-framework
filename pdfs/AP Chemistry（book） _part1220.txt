Bonding Examine 
the 
bonding 
in molecular substances, in which atoms 
bond by sharing one or more electron pairs. 
In general, the electrons are shared in such 
a way that each atom attains an octet of 
electrons.
 
8.4 ▶ Bond Polarity and 
Electronegativity Learn that 
electronegativity is the ability of an atom 
in a compound to attract electrons to 
itself. In general, electron pairs are shared 
unequally between atoms with different 
electronegativities, leading to polar covalent 
bonds.
 
8.5 ▶ Drawing Lewis Structures Learn  
that Lewis structures are a simple yet 
powerful way of predicting covalent bonding 
patterns in molecules. In addition to the 
octet rule, see how the concept of formal 
charge can be used to identify the dominant 
Lewis structure.
 
8.6 ▶ Resonance Structures Learn that in 
some cases, more than one equivalent Lewis 
structure can be drawn for a molecule or 
polyatomic ion. The bonding description 
in such cases is a blend of two or more 
resonance stru
