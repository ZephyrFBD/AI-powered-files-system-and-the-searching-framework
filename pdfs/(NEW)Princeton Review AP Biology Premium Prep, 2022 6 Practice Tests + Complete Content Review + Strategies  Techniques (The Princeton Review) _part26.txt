the production of Fursilla transcript.
(C) Because Fursilla transcript levels decrease when LSFR is unexpressed in the cell, LSFR must compete for
the binding site or RNA polymerase.
(D) Because Fursilla transcript levels increase when DRKFR is unexpressed in the cell, DRKFR must compete
for the binding site of RNA polymerase.
15. An additional protein, Baldidog (BLD), was identified and found to interact with the DRKFR protein. Based
on this information, which of the following best describes why these proteins are able to bind together?
(A) Complementary nucleotides sequences
(B) Amino acid pockets with complementary conformations
(C) Opposing regions rich in cytosines and thymines
(D) Hydrophobic lipids and hydrophobic molecules
16. How would the overexpression of BLD affect the transcript levels of Fursilla?
(A) Fursilla transcript levels would increase.
(B) Fursilla transcript levels would decrease.
(C) Fursilla transcript levels would be unaffected.
(D) Fursilla transcript would c
