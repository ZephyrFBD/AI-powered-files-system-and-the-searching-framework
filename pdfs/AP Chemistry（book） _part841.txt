25.0 °C? (b) Which will require more 
heat, increasing the temperature of 1 mol of C8H181l2 by 
a certain amount or increasing the temperature of 1 mol of 
H2O1l2 by the same amount?
 5.54 Consider the data about gold metal in Exercise 5.26(b). 
 
(a) Based on the data, calculate the specific heat of Au(s). 
 
(b) Suppose that the same amount of heat is added to two 
10.0-g blocks of metal, both initially at the same tem-
perature. One block is gold metal, and one is iron metal. 
Which block will have the greater rise in temperature after 
the addition of the heat? (c) What is the molar heat capac-
ity of Au(s)?
 5.55 When a 6.50-g sample of solid sodium hydroxide dissolves 
in 100.0 g of water in a coffee-cup calorimeter (Figure 5.18), 
the temperature rises from 21.6 to 37.8 °C. (a) Calculate the 
quantity of heat (in kJ) released in the reaction. (b) Using 
your result from part (a), calculate ∆H (in kJ>mol NaOH) 
for the solution process. Assume that the specific heat of the
