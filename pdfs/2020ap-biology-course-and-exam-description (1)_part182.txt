SUGGESTED SKILL

TOPIC 6.5
Regulation of 
Gene Expression
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
IST-2
Differences in the expression of genes account for some of the phenotypic 
differences between organisms.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-2.A
Describe the types of 
interactions that regulate 
gene expression.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-2.A.1
Regulatory sequences are stretches of DNA 
that interact with regulatory proteins to 
control transcription.
IST-2.A.2
Epigenetic changes can affect gene expression 
through reversible modifications of DNA or histones.
IST-2.A.3
The phenotype of a cell or organism is determined 
by the combination of genes that are expressed 
and the levels at which they are expressed—
a.	Observable cell differentiation results 
from the expression of genes for tissue-
specific proteins.
b.	Induction of transcription factors during 
development results in sequentia
