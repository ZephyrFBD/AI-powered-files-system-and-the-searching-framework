he object under 
consideration (or for each object, if more than one),
showing all (and only) the forces acting on that
object and exactly where they act, so you can deter-
mine the torque due to each. Gravity acts at the CM
of the object (Section 7–8).
4. Identify the axis of rotation and determine the
torques about it. Choose positive and negative
A heavy pulley. A 15.0-N force (represented by 
) is applied
to a cord wrapped around a pulley of mass 
and radius 
Fig. 8–21. The pulley accelerates uniformly from rest to an angular speed of
in 3.00 s. If there is a frictional torque 
at the axle,
determine the moment of inertia of the pulley. The pulley rotates about its center.
APPROACH We follow the steps of the Problem Solving Strategy above.
SOLUTION
1. Draw a diagram. The pulley and the attached cord are shown in Fig. 8–21.
2. Choose the system: the pulley.
3. Draw a free-body diagram. The force that the cord exerts on the pulley is
shown as 
in Fig. 8–21. The friction force acts al
