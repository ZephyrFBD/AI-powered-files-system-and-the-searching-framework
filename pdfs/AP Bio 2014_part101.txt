P to target proteins. A representation of the LDS2B 
gene is shown in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1. Genomic structure of the LDS2B gene. The seven exons (numbered rectangular boxes), the introns 
(thin lines between the boxes), and the start and stop signals for translation are represented. The 
portions of the gene that encode the different structural regions of the protein are shown, and the 
location of a methionine-to-valine substitution at position 425 of the encoded polypeptide (M425V) is 
indicated.

(a) Based on a pedigree of a family in which one parent in the first generation has Loeys-Dietz syndrome  
(type 2B), a researcher claims that the disorder is an autosomal dominant condition. Describe TWO 
characteristics of the pedigree that would support the researcherâ€™s claim. 
(b) Calculate the minimum number of nucleotides required in the coding region of the LDS2B mRNA molecule 
to produce and terminate the 565-amino acid polypeptide. Provide TW
