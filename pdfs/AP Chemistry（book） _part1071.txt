▲ Figure 7.5 Variations in effective nuclear charge for period 2 and period 3 elements.
Moving from one element to the next in the periodic table, the increase in Zeff felt by 
the innermost (1s) electrons (red circles) closely tracks the increase in nuclear charge 
Z (black line) because these electrons are not screened much. The results of several 
 
methods to calculate Zeff for valence electrons are shown in other colors.
To get a sense of how effective nuclear charge varies as both
