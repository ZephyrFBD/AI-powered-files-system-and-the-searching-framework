ession of characteristics is accomplished through the expression of genes carried on chromosomes. The
genetic makeup of peas consists of two similar or homologous copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. Each
pair of homologous chromosomes has the same linear order of genes. In other words, peas are diploid organisms in that
they have two copies of each chromosome. The same is true for many other plants and for virtually all animals. Diploid
organisms utilize meiosis to produce haploid gametes, which contain one copy of each homologous chromosome that unite

For cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or
may not encode the same version of that characteristic. Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative
