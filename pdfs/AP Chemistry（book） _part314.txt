m ions that do not have a noble-gas electron arrange-
ment. Use the periodic table, Figure 2.14, to determine which of 
the following ions has a noble-gas electron arrangement, and 
which do not. For those that do, indicate the noble-gas arrange-
ment they match: (a) Ti4+, (b) Mn2+, (c) Pb2+, (d) Te2-, (e) Zn2+.
 
â–¶Practice Exercise 2
Predict the charge expected for the most stable ion of  
(a) aluminum and (b) fluorine.
SOLUTION
We will assume that barium and oxygen form ions that have the 
same number of electrons as the nearest noble-gas atom. From 
the periodic table, we see that barium has atomic number 56. The 
 
nearest noble gas is xenon, atomic number 54. Barium can attain a 
stable arrangement of 54 electrons by losing two electrons, forming 
the Ba2+ cation.
Oxygen has atomic number 8. The nearest noble gas is neon, 
atomic number 10. Oxygen can  
attain this stable electron arrange-
ment by gaining two electrons, forming the O2- anion.
The periodic table is very useful for
