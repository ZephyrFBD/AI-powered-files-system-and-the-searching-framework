every
second. (b) The audio information is sent to each of the
two loudspeakers 44,100 times per second. Each of these
samplings requires 16 bits, and so you might expect the
required bit rate for a CD player to be
where the 2 is for the 2 loudspeakers (the 2 stereo channels).
Note that 
is less than the number N of bits actually
read per second by a CD player. The excess number of
bits
is needed for encoding and error-
correction. What percentage of the bits on a CD are
dedicated to encoding and error-correction?

5. The position of a ball rolling in a straight line is given by
where x is in meters and in seconds.
(a) What do the numbers 2.0, 3.6, and 1.7 refer to? (b) What
are the units of each of these numbers? (c) Determine the
position of the ball at
2.0 s, and 3.0 s. (d) What is
the average velocity over the interval
