1 amu = 1.66054 * 10-24 g and 1 g = 6.02214 * 1023 amu
The atomic mass unit is presently defined by assigning a mass of exactly 12 amu to a 
chemically unbound atom of the 12C isotope of carbon. In these units, an 1H atom has a 
mass of 1.0078 amu and an 16O atom has a mass of 15.9949 amu.
Give It Some Thought 
To how many significant figures would you need to express the mass of an oxygen-16 
atom in amu to notice the change in mass that occurs when it gains an electron? 
Give It Some Thought 
Two isotopes of boron are found in nature: 10B has a mass of 10.01 amu, and 11B 
has a mass of 11.01 amu. Use the atomic weight of boron found in the periodic 
table to determine which isotope is more abundant, 10B or 11B.
Atomic Weight
Most elements occur in nature as mixtures of isotopes. We can determine the average 
atomic mass of an element, usually called the elementâ€™s atomic weight, by summing 
(indicated by the Greek sigma, g) over the masses of its isotopes multiplied by their rel-
