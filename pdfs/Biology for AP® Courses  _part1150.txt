Figure 10.11 The cell cycle is controlled at three checkpoints. The integrity of the DNA is assessed at the G1
checkpoint. Proper chromosome duplication is assessed at the G2 checkpoint. Attachment of each kinetochore to a
spindle fiber is assessed at the M checkpoint.
The G1 Checkpoint
The G1 checkpoint determines whether all conditions are favorable for cell division to proceed. The G1 checkpoint, also
called the restriction point (in yeast), is a point at which the cell commits to the cell division process. External influences,
such as growth factors, play a large role in carrying the cell past the G1 checkpoint. In addition to adequate reserves and cell
size, there is a check for genomic DNA damage at the G1 checkpoint. A cell that does not meet all the requirements will not
be allowed to progress into the S phase. The cell can halt the cycle and attempt to remedy the problematic condition, or the
cell can advan
