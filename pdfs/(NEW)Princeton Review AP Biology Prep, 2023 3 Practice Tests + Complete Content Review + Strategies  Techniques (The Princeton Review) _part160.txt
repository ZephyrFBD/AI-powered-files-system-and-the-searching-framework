pending on the side chain that they have.
How do the side chains of the amino acids differ?
Composition of elements (C, H, O, N, and S)
Polarity (polar, nonpolar)
Charge (neutral, positive, negative)
Shape (long chain, short chain, ring-shape)
Side chain polarity affects whether an amino acid is more hydrophobic or more hydrophilic. While there are
different ways of categorizing amino acids, the AP Exam divides them into 3 broad categories: hydrophobic (non-
polar and uncharged), hydrophilic (polar and uncharged), and ionic (polar and charged). Of the common amino
acids, two (glutamic acid and aspartic acid) donate a proton, making them negatively charged. Two (lysine and
arginine) accept a proton at physiological pH, which makes them positively charged. Finally, two contain the atom
sulfur: methionine and cysteine.
