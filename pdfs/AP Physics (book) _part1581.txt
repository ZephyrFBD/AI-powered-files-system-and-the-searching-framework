 310 g of
water at room temperature of 20.0°C. The final situation is
all water at 17.0°C. What was the mass of the ice cube?
35. (II) A 55-g bullet traveling at 
penetrates a block of
ice at 0°C and comes to rest within the ice. Assuming that
the temperature of the bullet doesn’t change appreciably,
how much ice is melted as a result of the collision?
14;6 to 14;8 Conduction, Convection, Radiation
36. (I) Calculate the rate of heat flow by conduction through
the windows of Example 14–8, assuming that there are
strong gusty winds and the external temperature is 
37. (I) One end of a 56-cm-long copper rod with a diameter of
2.0 cm is kept at 460°C, and the other is immersed in water
at 22°C. Calculate the heat conduction rate along the rod.
38. (II) (a) How much power is radiated by a tungsten sphere
(emissivity
) of radius 19 cm at a temperature of
25°C? (b) If the sphere is enclosed in a room whose walls
are kept at 
what is the net flow rate of energy out of
the sphere?
–5°C,
 = 0.3
