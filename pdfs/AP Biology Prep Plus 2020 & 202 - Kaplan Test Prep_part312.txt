elf
occurs over extremely short distances, but the combined eﬀect of
multiple synaptic signals plus action potential transmission along
lengthy axons can result in long distance communication. As electric
signals reach axon terminals, they cause the release of chemicals called
neurotransmitters. These chemical messengers bind to nearby receptors
in postsynaptic cells and cause an electrical signal to be propagated or
continued. By sending information from one neuron to another, nervous
systems can produce rapid communication over long distances without a
diminished eﬀect (which can happen when sending individual molecules
over long distances, such as through the bloodstream). Endocrine
signaling refers to the secretion of chemical messengers into the
bloodstream (or other liquid medium, such as is the case with plants) for
widespread distribution throughout the entire organism.
