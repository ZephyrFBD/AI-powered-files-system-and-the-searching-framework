of experiments to gather information about negative and positive responses to chemical 
stimuli. Students note patterns and ratios, and then design and conduct additional 
experiments based on unanswered questions from their initial series of experiments. The 
investigation provides students an opportunity to explore more deeply behaviors that 
underlie chemotaxis. 
 Investigation 13: Enzyme Activity  provides new twists for Laboratory 
2 (Enzyme Catalysis) in the 2001 AP Biology Lab Manual by taking students through 
a guided inquiry exploration of biotic and abiotic factors that influence the rates of 
enzymatic reactions. Students explore the catalytic activity of peroxidase, an enzyme that 
breaks down hydrogen peroxide, a toxic metabolic waste product of aerobic respiration, 
converting peroxide into water and oxygen gas
