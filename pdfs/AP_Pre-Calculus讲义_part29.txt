 value of f is f(h) = k. 
 
If a < 0, then the maximum value of f is f(h) = k. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Example 2 
Consider the quadratic function f(x) = 5x2 -30x +49 
(a) Express f in standard form. 
(b) Sketch a graph of f. 
(c) Find the minimum value of f. 
 
 
 
 
 
This formula is obtained by completing the square for the general quadratic function as 
follows.

where n is a nonnegative integer and an ≠ 0. 
The numbers a0, a1, a2, . . . , an are called the coefficients of the polynomial. 
The number a0 is the constant coefficient or constant term. 
The number an, the coefficient of the highest power, is the leading coefficient, and the
