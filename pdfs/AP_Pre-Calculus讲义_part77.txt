Let’s consider the relationship between the trigonometric functions of t and those of −t . 
sin(−t) = −y = −sin t 
cos(−t) = x = cos t

These equations show that sine and tangent are odd functions, whereas cosine is an even 
function. 
EVEN-ODD PROPERTIES 
Sine, cosecant, tangent, and cotangent are odd functions; cosine and secant are even 
functions. 
 
 
Example 4 
Use the even-odd properties of the trigonometric function to determine each value.
