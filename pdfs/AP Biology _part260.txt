When Do You Multiply? Multiplication Rule
To find the probability of two independent events happening, multiply
the chance of one happening by the chance that the other will happen. For
example, the chance of a couple having two boys depends on two
independent events. The chance of the first child being a boy is 12; the
chance of the next child being a boy is 12. Therefore, the chance that the
couple will have two boys is 12×13=14. The chance of having three boys
is 12×12×12=18.

When Do You Add? Addition Rule
When more than one arrangement of events producing the specified
outcome is possible, the probabilities for each outcome are added together.
For example, if a couple is planning on having two children, what is the
chance that they will have one boy and one girl (in either order)? Here is
how you s
