st 
cases, the reaction of oxygen with a metal forms the metal oxide.
As seen from Equations 7.18 through 7.21, the alkali metals are extremely reactive 
toward water and oxygen. Because of this reactivity, the metals are usually stored sub-
merged in a liquid hydrocarbon, such as mineral oil or kerosene.
Although alkali metal ions are colorless, each emits a characteristic color when 
placed in a flame (Figure 7.22). The ions are reduced to gaseous metal atoms in the 
flame. The high temperature excites the valence electron from the ground state to a 
higher-energy orbital, causing the atom to be in an excited state. The atom then emits 
energy in the form of visible light as the electron falls back into the lower-energy 
orbital and the atom returns to its ground state. The light emitted is at a specific wave-
length for each element, just as we saw earlier for line spectra of hydrogen and sodium. 
 (Section 6.3) The characteristic yellow emission of sodium at 589 nm is the basis
