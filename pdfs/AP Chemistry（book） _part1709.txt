The first two are collectively called van der Waals forces after Johannes van der Waals 
(1837â€“1923), who developed the equation for predicting the deviation of gases from 
ideal behavior. 
 (Section 10.9) Another kind of attractive force, the ionâ€“dipole force, 
is important in solutions.
All intermolecular interactions are electrostatic, involving attractions between 
positive and negative species, much like ionic bonds. 
 (Section 8.2) Why then are 
intermolecular forces so much weaker than ionic bonds? Recall from Equation 8.4 that 
electrostatic interactions get stronger as the magnitude of the charges increases and

weaker as the distance between charges increases. The charges responsible for inter-
molecular forces are generally much smaller than the charges in ionic compounds. For 
example, from its dipole moment
