 
be irreversible and spontaneous.
The magnitude of ∆G is also signiﬁcant. A reaction for which 
∆G is large and negative, such as the burning of gasoline, is much 
more capable of doing work on the surroundings than is a reaction 
for which ∆G is small and negative, such as ice melting at room tem-
perature. In fact, thermodynamics tells us that the change in free energy 
for a process, ∆G, equals the maximum useful work that can be done by the 
system on its surroundings in a spontaneous process occurring at constant 
temperature and pressure:
∆G = -wmax 
[19.18]
(Remember our sign convention from Table 5.1: Work done by a sys-
tem is negative.) In other words, ∆G gives the theoretical limit to how 
much work can be done by a process.
The relationship in Equation 19.18 explains why ∆G is called the 
free energy change—it is the portion of the energy change of a spon-
taneous reaction that is free to do useful work. The remainder of the 
energy enters the environment as heat. For exam
