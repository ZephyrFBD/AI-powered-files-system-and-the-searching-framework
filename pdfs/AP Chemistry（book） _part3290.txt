y concept of acids and bases, acid–
base reactions are viewed as proton-transfer reactions. 
The stronger the acid, the weaker is its conjugate base. 
If we were to think of redox reactions in a similar way, 
what particle would be analogous to the proton? Would 
strong oxidizing agents be analogous to strong acids or 
strong bases? [Sections 20.1 and 20.2]

20.2  You may have heard that “antioxidants” are good for your 
health. Is an “antioxidant” an oxidizing agent or a reduc-
ing agent? [Sections 20.1 and 20.2]
 
20.3  The diagram that follows represents a molecular view of a 
process occurring at an electrode in a voltaic cell.
(a) Does the process represent oxidation or reduction? 
(b) Is the electrode the anode or cathode? (c) Why are the 
atoms in the electrode represented by larger spheres than 
those in the solution? [Section 20.3]
 
20.4  Assume that you want to construct a voltaic cell that uses 
the following half-reactions:
A2+1aq2 + 2 e- ¡ A1s2
