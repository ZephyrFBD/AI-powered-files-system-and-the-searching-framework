 nitrogenous base)
Any of these four bases can attach to the sugar. As we’ll soon see, this is extremely important when it comes to the
message of the genetic code in DNA.
The nucleotides can link up in a long chain to form a single strand of DNA. Here’s a small section of a DNA strand.
The nucleotides themselves are linked together by phosphodiester bonds between the sugars and the phosphates.
This is called the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA and it serves as a scaffold for the bases.
Two DNA Strands
Each DNA molecule consists of two strands that wrap around each other to form a long, twisted ladder called a
double helix. The structure of DNA was brilliantly deduced in 1953 by three scientists: Watson, Crick, and
Franklin.
Now let’s look at the way two DNA strands get together. Again, think of DNA as a ladder. The sides of the ladder
consist of alternating sugar and phosphate groups, while the rungs of the ladder consist of pairs of nitrogenous bases.
The nitrogenous bases pair up in
