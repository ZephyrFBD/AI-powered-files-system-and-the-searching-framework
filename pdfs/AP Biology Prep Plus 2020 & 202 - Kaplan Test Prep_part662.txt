RNA polymerase must be able to bind to a promoter (a specific DNA
sequence) in order for transcription to occur. This is only possible
when the DNA is relatively loosely packed. Thus, euchromatin will be
transcribed more readily than heterochromatin, making (A) correct.
(B) is incorrect because polymerase will access euchromatin more
easily than heterochromatin. (C) and (D) are incorrect because DNA
polymerase is operative in DNA replication, not in transcription.

Because the agouti and full-color traits are dominant, according to the
question stem, then it is quite likely that the male is homozygous
dominant for both traits if all of the oﬀspring were agouti and full-
color. (A) is thus correct. (B) is incorrect because a male that was
heterozygous for both traits would likely lead to a greater mix of
oﬀspring phenotypes when mated with the specified female. (C) and
(D) are incorrect because a parent that was homozygous dominant for
both trait
