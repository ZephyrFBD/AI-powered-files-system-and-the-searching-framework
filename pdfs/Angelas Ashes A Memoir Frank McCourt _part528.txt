 When we’re back home it takes a while to dig Alphie out from 
 
 under the load of coal and turf and he won’t stop screaming till I give 
 
 him bread and marmalade. I’m afraid Mam will leap from her bed but

 Malachy is back with Michael, with stories of his adventures ringing 
 
 doorbells. One rich woman answered the door herself and invited 
 
 him into the kitchen for cake and milk and bread and jam. She asked 
 
 him all about his family and he told her his father had a big job in 
 
 England but his mother is in the bed with a desperate disease and calling 
 
 for lemonade morning noon and night. The rich woman wanted to

 care of ourselves, that there was no shortage of bread and marmalade. 
 
 The rich woman wrote down Michael’s name and address and told him 
 
 be a good boy and go home to his brothers
