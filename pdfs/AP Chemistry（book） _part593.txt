orine has an oxidation number of -1 both before and after the reac-
tion, indicating that it is neither oxidized nor reduced. In fact, the Cl- ions are spectator 
ions, dropping out of the net ionic equation:
 
Mg1s2 + 2 H+1aq2 ¡ Mg2+1aq2 + H21g2 
[4.25]
Metals can also be oxidized by aqueous solutions of various salts. Iron metal, for 
example, is oxidized to Fe2+ by aqueous solutions of Ni2+ such as Ni1NO3221aq2:
Molecular equation: 
Fe1s2 + Ni1NO3221aq2 ¡ Fe(NO3221aq2 + Ni1s2 
[4.26]
Net ionic equation: 
Fe1s2 + Ni2+1aq2 ¡ Fe2+1aq2 + Ni1s2 
[4.27]
The oxidation of Fe to Fe2+ in this reaction is accompanied by the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni. 
Remember: Whenever one substance is oxidized, another substance must be reduced.
