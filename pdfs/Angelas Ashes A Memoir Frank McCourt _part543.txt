ispers that Michael shouldn’t 
 
 get the ashes because he won’t be making his First Communion till May 
 
 and it would be a sin. Michael starts to cry, I want the ashes, I want the 
 
  
  
 ashes. An old woman behind us says,What are ye doin’ to that lovely 
 
 child? Malachy explains the lovely child never made his First Communion 
 
 and he’s not in a state of grace.Malachy is getting ready for Con- 
 
 firmation himself, always showing off his knowledge of the catechism, 
 
 always going on about state of grace. He won’t admit I knew all about 
 
 the state of grace a year ago, so long ago I’m starting to forget it.The 
 
 old woman says you don’t have to be in a state of grace to get a few 
 
 ashes on your forehead and tells Malachy stop tormenting his poor little 
 
 brother. She pats Michael on the head and tells him he’s a lovely child 
 
 and go up there and get your ashes. He runs to the altar and when he 
 
 comes back the woman gives him a penny to go with his ashes.
