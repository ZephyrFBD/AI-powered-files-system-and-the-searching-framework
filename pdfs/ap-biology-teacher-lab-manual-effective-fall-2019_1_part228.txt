man population? Why don’t they gradually disappear? 
Now think about a dominant Mendelian trait such as polydactyly (more than five 
fingers on a single hand or toes on a foot) in humans. Polydactyly is  
a dominant trait, but it is not a common trait in most human populations.  
Why not? 
How do inheritance patterns or allele frequencies change in a population? Our  
investigation begins with an exploration of answers to these simple questions.  
  
 
 
 
  
 
Step 2 Determine the basic ingredients. 
Let’s try to simplify the question How do inheritance patterns or allele frequencies change 
in a population? with some basic assumptions. For this model, assume that all the 
organisms in our hypothetical population are diploid. This organism has a gene locus 
with two alleles — A and B. (We could use A and a to represent the alleles, but A and B 
are easier to work with in the spreadsheet you’ll be developing.) So far, this imaginary 
population is much like any sexually reproducing pop
