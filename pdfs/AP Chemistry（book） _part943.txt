distance from the nucleus is the same regardless of the direction in which we proceed 
from the nucleus. All of the other s orbitals (2s, 3s, 4s, and so forth) are also spherically 
symmetric and centered on the nucleus.
Recall that the l quantum number for the s orbitals is 0; therefore, the ml quantum 
number must be 0. Thus, for each value of n, there is only one s orbital. So how do s orbit-
als differ as the value of n changes? For example, how does the  
electron-density distribu-
tion of the hydrogen atom change when the electron is excited from the 1s orbital to the 
2s orbital? To address this question, we will look at the radial probability density, which is 
the probability that the electron is at a specific distance from the nucleus.
Figure 6.19 shows the radial probability densities for the 1s, 2s, and 3s orbitals of hydro-
gen as a function of r, the distance from the nucleusâ€”each resulting curve is the radial 
probability function for the orbital. Three features of thes
