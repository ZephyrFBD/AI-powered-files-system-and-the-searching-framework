will be a decreased need to pump excess water out.
(C)
This option is incorrect because the external concentration of salt has no direct 
relationship with internal ATP production by cellular respiration. As long as the 
parameciumâ€™s internal environment is not altered, then cellular respiration should 
be unaffected, and therefore the contractile vacuole will have sufficient energy.
(D)
This option is incorrect because even at isosmotic concentrations water still 
diffuses, but in dynamic equilibrium.

Question 26
Essential Knowledge
2.D.1: All biological systems from cells and organisms to 
populations, communities, and ecosystems are affected 
by complex biotic and abiotic interactions involving 
exchange of matter and free energy.
