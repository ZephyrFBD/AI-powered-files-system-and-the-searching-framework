der normal conditions, stomata are closed during the daytime and open during the nighttime.
 
B. Stomata open in response to low CO2 concentrations in the
 
environment.
 
C. Stomata open in response to low H2 Octivated protein (MAP)
 
signaling cascade. Mitogens are substances that stimulate concentrations in the soil.
 
D. Stomata close in response to high temperatures.
 
Question 2 refers to the following figure:
 
2. An iodine solution (IKI or Lugolâ€™s solution) turns from yellow-brown to blue when it reacts with starch, but not
when it reacts with glucose. A bag made from a selectively permeable material and containing iodine solution is
placed into a beaker containing a solution of glucose and starch. Using only this information, which of the following
can be correctly concluded if the solution in the beaker turns blue but the contents of the bag remain unchanged in
color?
A. Glucose moved from the beaker into the bag.
B. The bag is permeable to IKI, but not to starch.
C. The bag
