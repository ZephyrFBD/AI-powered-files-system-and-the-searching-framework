Silver oxide decomposes when heated:
2 Ag2O1s2 ¡
∆
4 Ag1s2 + O21g2
If 5.76 g of Ag2O is heated and the O2 gas produced by the re-
action is collected in an evacuated flask, what is the pressure 
of the O2 gas if the volume of the flask is 0.65 L and the gas  
temperature is 25 °C?  
(a) 0.94 atm (b) 0.039 atm (c) 0.012 atm  
(d) 0.47 atm (e) 3.2 atm
The number of moles of N2 is determined using 
the ideal-gas equation:
n = PV
RT =
11.15 atm2136 L2
10.08206 L@atm>mol@K21299 K2
= 1.7 mol N2
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
In the first step of the industrial process for making nitric 
acid, ammonia reacts with oxygen in the presence of a  
suitable catalyst to form nitric oxide and water vapor:
4 NH31g2 + 5 O21g2 ¡ 4 NO1g2 + 6 H2O1g2
How many liters of NH31g2 at 850 °C and 5.00 atm are  
required to react with 1.00 mol of O21g2 in this reaction?
