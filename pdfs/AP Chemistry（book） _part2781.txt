 Protection 
Agency (EPA) for lead in drinking water is 15 parts per billion (ppb). 
According to EPA regulations, utilities serving more than 50,000 
people must monitor the level of lead in their water and take cor-
rective action if more than 10% of the homes sampled exceed the 15 
ppb limit. Tests performed on samples collected in September 2015 
by researchers from Virginia Tech found that in 10% of the 252 Flint 
homes tested the lead concentration exceeded 25 ppb, and in several 
homes the concentration exceeded 100 ppb. At the same time, a local 
pediatrician analyzed the results of infant blood tests and found that 
the percentage of children with elevated concentrations of lead in 
their bloodstream (750 ppb) had doubled from 2.4% in the 2013 to 
4.9% in 2015.
The troubles began in April 2014 when the city began using the 
nearby Flint River as the natural source of its municipal water. Prior 
to that, Flint obtained water from Detroit, where water taken from 
Lake Huron was
