d coded areas are spliced together to form mRNA which encodes the final protein.
c.
Helper proteins attach themselves to mRNA in order to remove the non-coded areas and thus form the pre-
mRNA which codes for the final protein.
d.
Helper proteins help the pre-mRNA to recruit various other components which splice out the non-coded
regions and form mRNA which codes for the final protein.
Processing of tRNAs and rRNAs
The tRNAs and rRNAs are structural molecules that have roles in protein synthesis; however, these RNAs are not
themselves translated. Pre-rRNAs are transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes in the nucleolus. Pre-tRNAs
are transcribed and processed in the nucleus and then released into the cytoplasm where they are linked to free amino acids
for protein synthesis.
Most of the tRNAs and rRNAs in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are first transcribed as a long precursor molecule that spans
multiple rRNAs or tRNAs. Enzymes then cleave the precursors into subunits correspondi
