occupied states (arrows) and
unoccupied states ( ) for the ground

we have shown the 
level of Li even though it is empty.

The ground-state configuration for all atoms is given in the Periodic Table, which
is displayed inside the back cover of this book, and discussed in the next Section.
[The exclusion principle applies to identical particles whose spin quantum num-
ber is a half-integer (
and so on), including electrons, protons, and neutrons;
such particles are called fermions, after Enrico Fermi who derived a statistical
theory describing them. A b
