lesson plans that incorporate quantitative skills in the study 
of biology. This framework is inspired by Bloom’s Taxonomy of cognitive development. 
(Bloom’s starts with knowledge as basal, and then moves to comprehension, application, 
analysis, synthesis, and finally, evaluation.) It is hoped that this taxonomy will help you 
organize your instructional strategies for introducing students to quantitative skills in 
biology investigations.

This chapter will focus on each of the levels of quantitative reasoning to provide you with 
a framework to help develop various quantitative skills in biology. For many instructors, 
quantitative skills were not part of their own background in biology. For this reason, 
a few specific examples of how quantitative skills inform various areas of biology are 
included to provide background con
