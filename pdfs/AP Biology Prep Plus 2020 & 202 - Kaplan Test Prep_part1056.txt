hat they eventually result in
the failure of the pathway. Therefore, the correct answer will involve a mechanism that
addresses downstream eﬀects of antimetabolite use. (B) does exactly this. (A) and (C)
focus on the antimetabolite causing the initial biochemical reaction to fail. Based on the
question stem, use of antimetabolites results in a normal biochemical reaction in cells,
rendering these choices incorrect. Nowhere in the question stem does it say that the
antimetabolite has any aﬀinity for the metabolite, so it is unlikely that it would bind to
the metabolite, eliminating (D).

The theory of gradualism maintains that dramatic changes are the products of slow and
continuous processes acting over a long time. Darwin employed this idea to explain how
seemingly vast diﬀerences between species could develop, even though all organisms
come from common ancestors. (B) describes exactly this idea. (A) describes a contrasting
viewpoint known as catastrophism. (C) and (D) are tenets
