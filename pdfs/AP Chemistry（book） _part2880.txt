CFCs. One such compound in current use is CH2FCF3, known as HFC-134a. While the 
HFCs are a big improvement over the CFCs because they contain no CÂ¬Cl bonds, it 
turns out that they are potent greenhouse warming gases, with which we will deal 
shortly.
There are no naturally occurring CFCs, but some natural sources contribute chlo-
rine and bromine to the atmosphere, and, just like halogens from CFCs, these nat-
urally occurring Cl and Br atoms can participate in ozone-depleting reactions. The 
principal natural sources are methyl bromide and methyl chloride, which are emitted 
from the oceans. It is estimated that these molecules contribute less than a third of 
the total Cl and Br in the atmosphere; the remaining two-thirds is a result of human 
activities.
Volcanoes are a source of HCl, but generally the HCl they release reacts with water in 
the troposphere and does not make it to the upper atmosphere.
