completely replicated, the two DNA copies move into two different cells during cell
division. The process of DNA replication can be summarized as follows:
1.
DNA unwinds at the origin of replication.

2.
Helicase opens up the DNA-forming replication forks; these are extended bidirectionally.
3.
Single-strand binding proteins coat the DNA around the replication fork to prevent rewinding of the DNA.
4.
Topoisomerase binds at the region ahead of the replication fork to prevent supercoiling.
5.
Primase synthesizes RNA primers complementary to the DNA strand.
6.
DNA polymerase starts adding nucleotides to the 3'-OH end of the primer.
7.
Elongation of both the lagging and the leading strand continues.
8.
RNA primers are removed by exonuclease activity.
9.
Gaps are filled by DNA pol by adding dNTPs.
10.
The gap between the two DNA fragments is sealed by DNA ligase, which
