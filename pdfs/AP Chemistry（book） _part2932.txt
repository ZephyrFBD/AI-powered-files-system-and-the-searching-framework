the pH of seawater is higher than that of blood (7.35–7.45), the sec-

The availability of carbonate ions plays an important role in 
shell formation for a number of marine organisms, including stony 
corals (Figure 18.24). These organisms, which are referred to as ma-
rine calcifiers and play an important role in the food chains of nearly 
all oceanic ecosystems, depend on dissolved Ca2 +  and CO3

to form their shells and exoskeletons. The relatively low solubility- 
product constant of CaCO3,
CaCO31s2 ∆Ca2 +1aq2 + CO3

and the fact that the ocean contains saturated concentrations of Ca2 +  
and CO3
2 -  mean that CaCO3 is usually quite stable once formed. In 
fact, calcium carbonate skeletons of creatures that died millions of 
years ago are not uncommon in the fossil record.
The concentration of dissolved CO2 in the ocean is sensit
