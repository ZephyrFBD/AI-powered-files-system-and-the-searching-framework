ceive the sperm
into the female body and then expel the developing embryo covered with shell, while still other species retain the
developing offspring through the gestation period.
34.3 Human Reproductive Anatomy and Gametogenesis
As animals became more complex, specific organs and organ systems developed to support specific functions for the
organism. The reproductive structures that evolved in land animals allow males and females to mate, fertilize internally,
and support the growth and development of offspring. Processes developed to produce reproductive cells that had exactly
half the number of chromosomes of each parent so that new combinations would have the appropriate amount of genetic
material. Gametogenesis, the production of sperm (spermatogenesis) and eggs (oogenesis), takes place through the process
of meiosis.
34.4 Hormonal Control of Human Reproduction
The male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by hormones released from the hypothalamus and anterior
pituitar
