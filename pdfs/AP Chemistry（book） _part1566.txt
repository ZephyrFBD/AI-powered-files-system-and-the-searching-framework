he lungs equals atmospheric pressure. Exhalation reverses the process—the 
rib cage contracts and the diaphragm moves up, decreasing the volume of the lungs. Air 
is forced out of the lungs by the resulting increase in pressure.

gas is inversely proportional to its pressure.
Give It Some Thought
What happens to the pressure of a gas in a closed container if you double its 
volume while its temperature is held constant?
