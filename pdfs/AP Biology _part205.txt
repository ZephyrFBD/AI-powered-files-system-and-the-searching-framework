STUDY TIP
Here is where most of the ATP is made in the cell.
Protons cannot diffuse through the cristae membrane; they can flow
only down the gradient into the matrix through ATP synthase
channels. This process is chemiosmosis, the key to the production
of ATP. As protons flow through the ATP synthase channels, they
generate energy to phosphorylate ADP into ATP. This process is
similar to how a hydroelectric plant converts the enormous potential
energy of water flowing through a dam to turn turbines and
generate electricity.
SYI-1
Explain how internal membranes and organelles contribute to cell functions.
Oxygen is the final hydrogen acceptor, combining half an oxygen
molecule with 2 electrons and 2 protons, thus forming water. This
water is a waste product of cell respiration and is excreted.
SUMMARY OF ATP PRODUCTION
ATP is produced in two ways.
Substrate level phosphorylation occurs when an
