in this structure has two unshared (terminal) oxygens and two shared (bridging) oxygens. 
The stoichiometry is then 2112 + 211>22 = 3 oxygens per silicon. Thus, the formula unit 
for this chain is SiO3
2 -. The mineral enstatite 1MgSiO32 has this kind of structure, consist-
ing of rows of single-strand silicate chains with Mg2 +  ions between the strands to balance 
charge.

What limits the range of temperatures 
you can use for zone refining of silicon?
Molten section
Silicon rod
Inert atmosphere
As heating coil 
slowly moves down, 
impurities 
concentrate in 
molten section, 
leaving behind 
ultrapure Si.
