The second exceptional result has long been speculated on: are neutrinos
massless as originally thought, or do they have a nonzero mass? Rough upper
limits on the masses have been made. Today astrophysical experiments show that
the sum of all three neutrino masses combined is less than about 
But
can all the masses be zero? Not if there are the flavor oscillations discussed above.
It seems that at most, one type could have zero mass, and it is likely that at least
one neutrino type has a mass of at least 
As a result of neutrino oscillations, the three types of neutrino may not be
exactly what we thought they were (e,
). If not, the three basic neutrinos,
called 1, 2, and 3, are combinations of 
and 
Another outstanding question is whether or not neutrinos are in the category
called Majorana particles,â€  meaning they would be their own antiparticles, like
and Higgs. If so, a lot of other questions (and answers) would appear.
