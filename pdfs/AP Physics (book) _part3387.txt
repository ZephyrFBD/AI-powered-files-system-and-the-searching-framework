s has required techniques such as com-
paring the expected ratio to the actual ratio for objects whose age is known, such
as very old trees whose annual rings can be counted reasonably accurately.
An ancient animal. The mass of carbon in an animal bone
fragment found in an archeological site is 200 g. If the bone registers an activity
of 
what is its age?
APPROACH First we determine how many 
atoms there were in our 200-g
sample when the animal was alive, given the known fraction of 
to 
Then we use Eq. 30–3b to find the activity back then, and Eq. 30–5
to find out how long ago that was by solving for the time .
SOLUTION The 200 g of carbon is nearly all 
12.0 g of 
contains
atoms, so 200 g contains
When the animal was alive, the ratio of 
to 
in the bone was 
The number of 
nuclei at that time was
From Eq. 30–3b with 
(Example 30–9) the magnitude of
the activity when the animal was still alive 
was
From Eq. 30–5
where R, its activity now, is given as 
Then
or
We take the natural logs
