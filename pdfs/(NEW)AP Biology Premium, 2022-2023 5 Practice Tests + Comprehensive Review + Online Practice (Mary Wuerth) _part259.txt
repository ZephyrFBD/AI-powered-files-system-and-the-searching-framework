to-oncogenes may become oncogenes, which promote abnormally high rates of cell division.
An oncogene acts in a similar way to how an accelerator stuck in the down position would cause a car to go too fast.
These oncogenes can cause tumors to form when cell division occurs too quickly and too often without regard for
the neighboring cells. A mutation in a single allele of a proto-oncogene can cause a cell to grow out of control and
can cause a tumor to form. Since a mutation in a single allele can cause a cell to grow out of control, proto-
oncogenes are said to function in a dominant way.
Tumor suppressor genes code for proteins that detect mutations in cells that may cause tumors to develop.
Tumor suppressor genes function much like the brakes on a car, preventing cell division from occurring at an
abnormally fast rate. If a single mutation in a tumor suppressor gene allele occurs, the cell will still possess one
remaining unmutated tumor suppressor allele that is functional. The tumo
