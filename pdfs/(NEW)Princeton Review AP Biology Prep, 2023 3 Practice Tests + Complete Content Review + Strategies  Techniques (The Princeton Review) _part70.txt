is defined as a
quaternary structure, (D).
40. C
The protein is known to be a homodimer, so it must have two polypeptides in it. Each polypeptide has one N-
terminus, so this dimer protein would have two. They would not occur at the active site, so Position A should
not be in the answer.
41. B
If fats are insoluble in water, figuring out what type of mixture it forms when mixed with water would help
target this property of lipids. The only option that discusses mixing with water is (B).
42. C
While (A) is true, the question is asking about stored energy. Choice (C) describes glycerol, which is a
component of cell membranes, and glucagonâ€™s function as a hormone will not affect energy storage.
43. B
Organic compounds are defined as molecules that contain carbon and are found in living organisms. Choice
(B) is the only option that references carbon.
44. A
Figure 1 is adenine, which is a nucleotide. Nucleotides are the monomers of nucleic acids, so the image
represents (B) and (C). Accordi
