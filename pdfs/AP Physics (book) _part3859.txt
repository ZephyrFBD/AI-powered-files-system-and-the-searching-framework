Solids
The principle of equipartition of energy can be applied to solids as well. The molar
specific heat of any solid at high temperature is close to 3R
Fig. D–4. This is called the Dulong and Petit value after the scientists who first
measured it in 1819. (Note that Table 14–1 gave the specific heats per kilogram,
not per mole.) At high temperatures, each atom apparently has six degrees of
freedom, although some are not active at low temperatures. Each atom in a crys-
talline solid can vibrate about its equilibrium position as if it were connected by
springs to each of its neighbors (Fig. D–5). Thus it can have three degrees of 
freedom for kinetic energy and three more associated with potential energy 
of vibration in each of the x, y, and z directions, which is in accord with measured
values.
