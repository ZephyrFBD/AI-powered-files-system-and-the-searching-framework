AEROBIC RESPIRATION: THE CITRIC ACID CYCLE
When oxygen is present, cells carry out aerobic respiration. It is highly
efficient and produces a lot of ATP. This process consists of an anaerobic
phase—glycolysis—plus an aerobic phase. The aerobic phase consists of
two parts: the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.

The citric acid cycle is also referred to as the Krebs cycle. Don’t let the different names
confuse you.
The citric acid cycle is a cyclical series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions
also known as the Krebs cycle. It takes place in the matrix of
mitochondria and requires pyruvate, the product of glycolysis. The citric
acid cycle completes the oxidation of glucose to CO2. It turns twice for
each glucose molecule that enters glycolysis (once for each pyruvate
molecule that enters the mitochondrion). The cycle generates 1 ATP per
turn by substrate level phosphorylation, th
