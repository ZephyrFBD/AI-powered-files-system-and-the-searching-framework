When only the electric field is present, say with the upper plate positive, the
cathode rays are deflected upward as in path a in Fig. 27–2. If only a magnetic
field exists, say inward, the rays are deflected downward along path c. These
observations are just what is expected for a negatively charged particle. The force
on the rays due to the magnetic field is
where e is the charge and v is
the velocity of the c
