Give It Some Thought
Explain how a chemical reaction that uses a catalyst can be “greener” than the 
same reaction run without a catalyst.
To illustrate how green chemistry works, consider the manufacture of styrene, an 
important building block for many polymers, including the expanded polystyrene pack-
ages used to pack eggs and restaurant takeout food. The global demand for styrene is 
more than 25 billion kg per year. For many years, styrene has been produced in a two-step 
process: Benzene and ethylene react to form ethyl benzene, followed by the ethyl ben-
zene being mixed with high-temperature steam and passed over an iron oxide catalyst to 
form styrene:

This process has several shortcomings. One is that both benzene, which is formed 
from crude oil, and et
