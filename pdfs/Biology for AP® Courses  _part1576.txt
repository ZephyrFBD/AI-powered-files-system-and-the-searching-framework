chromosomes. Prokaryotes pack their
chromosomes by super coiling, managed by
DNA gyrase. Eukaryote chromosomes are
wrapped around histone proteins that create
heterochromatin and euchromatin, which is not
present in prokaryotes.
b.
Prokaryotes have a single, circular chromosome,
while eukaryotes have multiple, linear
chromosomes. Prokaryotes pack their
chromosomes by super coiling, managed by
DNA gyrase. Eukaryote chromosomes are
wrapped around histone proteins that could form
heterochromatin, which is not present in
prokaryotes.
