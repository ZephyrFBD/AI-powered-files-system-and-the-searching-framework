ts a bit of bread and cheese, 
 
 smokes her Wild Woodbine. She goes to the door to see if Dad is coming 
 
 down the lane and she talks about the paydays when we searched 
 
 for him all over Brooklyn. She says, Some day we’ll all go back to 
 
 America and we’ll have a nice warm place to live and a lavatory down 
 
  
  
 the hall like the one in Classon Avenue and not this filthy thing outside 
 
 our door. 
 
 The women are coming home from the cinemas, laughing, and the 
 
 men, singing, from the pubs. Mam says there’s no use waiting up any 
 
 longer. If Dad stays in the pubs till closing time there will be nothing 
 
 left from his wages and we might as well go to bed. She lies in her bed 
 
 with Michael in her arms. It’s quiet in the lane and I can hear her crying 
 
 even though she pulls an old coat over her face and I can hear in 
 
 the distance,my father. 
 
 I know it’s my father because he’s the only one in Limerick who sings 
 
 that song from the North, Roddy McCorley
