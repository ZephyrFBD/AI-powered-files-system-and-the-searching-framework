a.
When photons strike photosystem (PS) II,
pigments pass the light energy to chlorophyll a
molecules that excite an electron, which is then
passed to the electron transport chain. The
cytochrome complex transfers protons across the
thylakoid membrane and transfers electrons
from PS-II to PS-I. The products of the light
dependent reaction are used to power the Calvin
cycle to produce glucose.
