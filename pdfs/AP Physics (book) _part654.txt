(a)
.
(b) 2.
(c) 4.
(d) 8.
4. A car traveling at a velocity v can stop in a minimum
distance d. What would be the car’s minimum stopping
distance if it were traveling at a velocity of 2v?
(a) d.
(b)

5. A bowling ball is dropped from a height h onto the center
of a trampoline, which launches the ball back up into the air.
How high will the ball rise?
(a) Significantly less than h.
(b) More than h. The exact amount depends on the mass of
the ball and the springiness of the trampoline.
(c) No more than h—probably a little less.
(d) Cannot tell without knowing the characteristics of the
trampoline.
6. A ball is thrown straight up. At what point does the ball
have the most energy? Ignore air resistance.
(a) At the highest point of its path.
(b) When it is first thrown.
