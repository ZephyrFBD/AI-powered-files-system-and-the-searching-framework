ee of those choices are incorrect.
3. (D) Glycolysis does not produce a proton gradient; the movement of electrons down the electron transport chain
produces a proton gradient. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are all true statements about glycolysis. Notice that this
question was asking for the statement about glycolysis that is NOT correct, which is choice (D).
4. (C) Chemiosmosis uses a proton gradient to drive the production of ATP. If protons were able to pass freely
through the inner mitochondrial membrane, a proton gradient could not be formed and chemiosmosis could not
occur. Glycolysis (choice (A)), the Krebs cycle (choice (B)), and fermentation (choice (D)) do not require a
proton gradient, so those processes would not be directly affected. Thus, choices (A), (B), and (D) are not
correct.
5. (B) During oxidative phosphorylation, NADH is oxidized to NAD+ and oxygen is reduced to water. Choice (A)
is incorrect because oxygen is not produced in oxidative phosphorylation. Choice (C) is
