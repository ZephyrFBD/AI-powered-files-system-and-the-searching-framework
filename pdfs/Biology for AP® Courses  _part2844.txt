cle cells have
striations, but, unlike the multinucleate skeletal cells, they have only one nucleus. Cardiac muscle tissue also has
intercalated discs, specialized regions running along the plasma membrane that join adjacent cardiac muscle cells and
assist in passing an electrical impulse from cell to cell.
Skeletal Muscle
Skeletal muscle has striations across its cells caused by the arrangement of the contractile proteins actin and myosin. These
muscle cells are relatively long and have multiple nuclei along the edge of the cell. Skeletal muscle is under voluntary,
somatic nervous system control and is found in the muscles that move bones. Figure 24.18 illustrates the histology of
skeletal muscle.
Cardiac Muscle
Cardiac muscle, shown in Figure 24.18, is found only in the heart. Like skeletal muscle, it has cross striations in its cells, but
cardiac muscle has a single, centrally located nucleus. Cardiac muscle is not under voluntary control but can be influenced
by the autonomic nervo
