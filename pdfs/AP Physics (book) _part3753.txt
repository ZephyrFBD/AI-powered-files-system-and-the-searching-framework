ng
to randomly moving particles with an average kinetic energy KE of about 100 GeV
(see Eq. 13–8):
(As an estimate, we usually ignore the factor 
in Eq. 13–8.) At that time,
symmetry between weak and electromagnetic forces would have broken down,
and the weak force separated from the electromagnetic.
As the universe cooled down to about 
K (KE
100 MeV), approxi-
mately 
s after the Big Bang, quarks stop moving freely and begin to
“condense” into more normal particles: nucleons and the other hadrons and their
antiparticles. With this confinement of quarks, the universe entered the hadron
era. But it did not last long. Very soon the vast majority of hadrons disappeared.
To see why, let us focus on the most familiar hadrons: nucleons and their anti-
particles. When the average kinetic energy of particles was somewhat higher than
1 GeV, protons, neutrons, and their antiparticles were continually being created
out of the energies of collisions involving photons and other particles, such as
