rence of the reproduction and
death rates),
t = the number of chronological steps of reproduction (seconds,
minutes, years, etc.), and
e = Euler’s number (approximately 2.71828).
The three lines on the above graph show the exponential increase in
population size with no limits according to the equation Nt = N0ert. Each
line represents a population increasing at the rate indicated, having
started with two individuals.
This graph shows how rapidly populations can grow when the increase is
exponential. Remember that t is a measure of the population’s rate of

producing another generation, which is very fast for bacteria. Some
bacteria can reproduce every 10 to 30 minutes, so 30 time steps would
only take between 5 and 15 hours. The upshot is that bacteria can grow to
numbers in the millions in only a matter of hours!
In reality, populations do not grow exponentially without limits. Most
reach a size at which they plateau, called the carrying capacity. This
