bound to the promoter is called a transcription initiation complex.
Once RNA polymerase is attached to the promoter, DNA
transcription of the DNA template begins.
Elongation of the strand continues as RNA polymerase adds
nucleotides to the 3′ end of a growing chain. RNA polymerase pries
the two strands of DNA apart and attaches RNA nucleotides
according to the base pairing rules: C with G and A with U. The
stretch of DNA that is transcribed into an mRNA molecule is called
a transcription unit. Each unit consists of triplets of bases called
codons (for example, AAU, CGA) that code for specific amino
acids. A single gene can be transcribed into mRNA simultaneously
by several molecules of RNA polymerase following each other in a
caravan fashion. Like DNA polymerases, RNA polymerase has
mechanisms for proofreading during transcription. Because mRNA
is usually short-lived, an
