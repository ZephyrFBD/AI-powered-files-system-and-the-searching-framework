hemiosmosis requires a proton gradient, so a membrane is needed to separate the protons into a gradient. In eukaryotes, this gradient is
generated across the thylakoid membrane. In prokaryotes, this gradient is formed in the infoldings of the plasma membrane.
The electrons from PSII that fell down the electron transport chain and are now on PSI need to be replaced on
PSII. The electrons in PSII come from the splitting of water molecules. The splitting of water molecules strips
electrons from the hydrogen atoms, producing the protons (the H+ ions), electrons for PSII, and oxygen gas. The
protons will be used to form a gradient as electrons pass through the ETC. This process, which is driven by the
energy from the sun (photons), is called photolysis. (See Figure 8.3.)
The proton gradient generated by the photolysis of water and the ETC powers the production of ATP by the
enzyme ATP synthase. (See Figure 8.3.) The process of using a proton gradient and ATP synthase to produce ATP
is calle
