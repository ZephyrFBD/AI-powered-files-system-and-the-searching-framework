ight (FW) of a substance is the sum of the atomic weights (AW) of the 
 
atoms in the chemical formula of the substance. Using atomic weights from the periodic 
table, we find, for  
example, that the formula weight of sulfuric acid, H2SO4, is 98.1 amu 
(atomic mass units):
FW of H2SO4 = 21AW of H2 + 1AW of S2 + 41AW of O2
  = 211.0 amu2 + 32.1 amu + 4116.0 amu2
 = 98.1 amu
For convenience, we have rounded off the atomic weights to one decimal place, a practice 
we will follow in most calculations in this book.
If the chemical formula is the chemical symbol of an element, such as Na, the 
formula weight equals the atomic weight of the element, in this case 23.0 amu. If the 
chemical formula is that of a molecule, the formula weight is also called the molecular 
weight (MW). The molecular weight of glucose 1C6H12O62, for  
example, is
MW of C6H12O6 = 6112.0 amu2 + 1211.0 amu2 + 6116.0 amu2 = 180.0 amu
Because ionic substances exist as three-dimensional arrays of ions (see Figure 2.20),
