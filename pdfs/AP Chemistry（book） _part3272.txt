 magnesium formed upon passage of a 
current of 60.0 A for a period of 4.00 * 103 s. (b) How many 
seconds would be required to produce 50.0 g of Mg from 
MgCl2 if the current is 100.0 A?
Coulombs = amperes * seconds = 110.0 C/s211.00 h2a 3600 s

Al3+ + 3 e- ¡ Al
Moles e- = 13.60 * 104 C2a 1 mol e-
96,485 C b = 0.373 mol e-
Grams Al = 10.124 mol Al2 a
27.0 g Al
1 mol Al b = 3.36 g Al
Second, we calculate the number of moles of 
electrons that pass into the cell:
Third, we relate number of moles of elec-
trons to number of moles of aluminum 
formed, using the half-reaction for the 
reduction of Al3+:
Thus, 3 mol of electrons are required to form 
1 mol of Al:
Moles Al = 10.373 mol e-2a 1 mol Al
3 mol e- b = 0.124 mol Al
Finally, we convert moles to grams:
Or, we could have combined all of the above 
steps:
Grams Al = 13.60 * 104 C2a 1 mol e-
96,485 C b a 1 mol Al
3 mol e- b a
27.0 g Al
1 mol Al b = 3.36 g Al
