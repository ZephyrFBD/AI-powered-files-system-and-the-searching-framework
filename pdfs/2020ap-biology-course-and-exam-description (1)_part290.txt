bserved

in animal behavior. 
Misconception Check
5.D: Use data to 
evaluate a hypothesis 
(or prediction), including
a. Rejecting or failing 
to reject the null 
hypothesis.
b. Supporting or 
refuting the alternative 
hypothesis.
Make a prediction using 
the data, and then justify 
the prediction.
Given data and a prediction, 
justify the prediction.
Given a null hypothesis 
and a graph, determine if 
the null hypothesis should 
be rejected.
Give students data from 
an experiment that can be 
found on a website such as 
datanuggets.org/. Have the 
students graph the data (or 
give them a graph), and ask 
them to make a prediction 
about what might happen 
if one of the environmental 
factors changed or if 
something about the 
experimental group changed.
