Figure 17.1 Activation of B and T cells
Regulatory T Cells and Self-Tolerance
Normally, the immune system exhibits self-tolerance, meaning it does not
attack body cells. However, sometimes immature lymphocytes develop
that have antigen receptors specific for the body’s own cells. If allowed to
escape, these cells would attack the body’s cells, a situation characteristic
of autoimmune disease. To avoid this, lymphocytes are tested for self-
reactivity as they mature in the bone marrow. B and T cells that are
identified as self-reactive are destroyed by apoptosis, programmed cell
death. (Also see page 53.) Regulatory T cells, called Treg, inhibit the
activation of the immune system in response to self-antigens. Treg secrete
interleukin-10 (Il-10).
