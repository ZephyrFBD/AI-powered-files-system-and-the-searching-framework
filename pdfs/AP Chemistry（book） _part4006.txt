ry then speciﬁed the nature of the diffuse negative 
charge. The prevailing theory before the nuclear model was Thom-
son’s plum pudding model: discrete electrons scattered about a dif-
fuse positive charge cloud. Bohr’s theory could not have been based 
on the Thomson model of the atom. (b) De Broglie’s hypothesis is 
that electrons exhibit both particle and wave properties. Thomson’s 
conclusion that electrons have mass is a particle property, while the 
nature of cathode rays is a wave property. De Broglie’s hypothesis 
actually rationalizes these two seemingly contradictory observations 
about the properties of electrons.

7.2 The largest brown sphere is Br-, the intermediate blue one is Br, 
and the smallest red one is F
. 7.5 (a) The bonding atomic radius of A, 
rA, is d1
 >  2; rx = d2 - (d1
 >  2). (b) The length of the X¬ X bond is 2rx 
or 2d2 - d1. 7.8 (a) X + 2F2 ¡  XF4 (b) X in the diagram has about 
the same bonding radius as F
, so it is likely to be a nonmetal.
