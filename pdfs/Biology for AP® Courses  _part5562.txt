at your peril and these ‘vaccines’
seriously – fundamentally – mess with immune response. Tenpenny
refers to a consequence called anaphylactic shock which is a severe
and highly dangerous allergic reaction when the immune system
ﬂoods the body with chemicals. She gives the example of having a
bee sting which primes the immune system and makes it sensitive to
those chemicals. When people are stung again maybe years later the
immune response can be so powerful that it leads to anaphylactic
shock. Tenpenny relates this ‘shock’ with regard to the ‘Covid
vaccine’ to something called polyethylene glycol or PEG. Enormous
numbers of people have become sensitive to this over decades of use
in a whole range of products and processes including food, drink,
skin creams and ‘medicine’. Studies have claimed that some 72
percent of people have antibodies triggered by PEG compared with
two percent in the 1960s and allergic hypersensitive reactions to this
become a gathering cause for concern. Tenpenny
