utant. (B) is
incorrect because the wild type enzyme with NAD+ reaches maximum
velocity at a lower concentration and has higher substrate specificity
than the mutant. (C) is incorrect because the wild type enzyme is more
eﬀicient with NADP+ and has higher substrate specificity than the
mutant.
4. A
Learning Objective: 9.3
Because the substrate and the inhibitor compete for the active site in
competitive inhibition, it is possible to increase the substrate
concentration enough to reach the same maximum velocity with the
inhibitor as at a lower substrate concentration without the inhibitor.
Hence, (A) is correct. (B) is incorrect because a competitive inhibitor
binds to the active site. (C) is incorrect because this is more indicative
of a noncompetitive inhibitor. (D) is incorrect because temperature
eﬀects give no indication of whether the inhibitor is competitive.
5. A
Learning Objective: 9.1
A certain amount of energy (the activation energy) is needed for the
reaction to take place.
