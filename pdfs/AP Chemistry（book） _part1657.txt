volume the gas will occupy if the temperature is increased to 
175 °C while the pressure is held constant.
 10.27 (a) Amonton’s law expresses the relationship between pres-
sure and temperature. Use Charles’s law and Boyle’s law to 
derive the proportionality relationship between P and T. (b) 
If a car tire is filled to a pressure of 32.0 lb>in.2 1psi2 measured 
at 75 °F, what will be the tire pressure if the tires heat up to 
120 °F during driving?
