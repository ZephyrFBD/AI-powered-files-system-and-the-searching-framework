s) of 
How many disintegrations occur per
second?
52. (II) A
sample of 
is decaying at a rate of
What is the mass of the sample?
53. (II) Rubidium;strontium dating. The rubidium isotope
a 
emitter with a half-life of 
is used
to determine the age of rocks and fossils. Rocks containing
fossils of ancient animals contain a ratio of 
to 
of
0.0260. Assuming that there was no 
present when the
rocks were formed, estimate the age of these fossils.
54. (II) Two of the naturally occurring radioactive decay
sequences start with 
and with 
The first five
decays of these two sequences are:
and
Determine the resulting intermediate daughter nuclei in
each case.
55. (II) An ancient wooden club is found that contains 73 g of
carbon and has an activity of 7.0 decays per second. Deter-
mine its age assuming that in living trees the ratio of
atoms is about 
56. (II) Use Fig. 30â€“11 and calculate the relative decay rates
for 
decay of 
and 
57. (III) The activity of a radioactive source decreases by 5.5%
