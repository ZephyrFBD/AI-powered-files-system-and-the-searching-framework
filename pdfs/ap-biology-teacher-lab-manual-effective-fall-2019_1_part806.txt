enzymatic reaction, you must measure a change in the amount of at least one specific 
substrate or product over time. In a decomposition reaction of peroxide by peroxidase 
(as noted in the above formula), the easiest molecule to measure would probably be 
oxygen, a final product. This could be done by measuring the actual volume of oxygen 
gas released or by using an indicator. In this experiment, an indicator for oxygen will 
be used. The compound guaiacol has a high affinity for oxygen, and in solution, it binds 
instantly with oxygen to form tetraguaiacol, which is brownish in color. The greater the 
amount of oxygen gas produced, the darker brown the solution will become. 
Qualifying color is a difficult task, but a series of dilutions can be made and then 
combined on a palette, which can represent the relative changes occurring during the 
reaction. A color palette/chart ranging from 1 to 10 (Figure 1)
