e, as you move from the root (ancestor) to the tips of the
branches (descendants), you move forward in time. Each branch
represents speciation. The following example shows the lineage of
primates.
Phylogenetic Tree of Primates Over Time
Cladograms
Also used to represent hypotheses on evolutionary relationships in a
group of organisms, a cladogram is similar in appearance to a
phylogenetic tree. Cladograms demonstrate similarities between types of
organisms with respect to a common ancestor, but they do not show
relationships of descent between diﬀerent taxa with respect to
evolutionary time and the amount of change with time. In constructing a
cladogram, shared characteristics of organisms derived from a common
ancestor are used to group the organisms. Examples of shared
characteristics are eukaryotic, warm-blooded, segmented body, fur, and
carnivorous diet. As with phylogenetic trees, organisms on the same
branch of a cladogram are more similar than those on diﬀerent branches.
