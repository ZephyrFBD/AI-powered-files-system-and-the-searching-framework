n. If the 
external pressure is reduced infinitely slowly, the piston will move outward, allowing the 
pressure of the confined gas to readjust to maintain the pressure balance. This infinitely 
slow process in which the external pressure and internal pressure are always in equilib-
rium is reversible. If we reverse the process and compress the gas in the same infinitely 
slow manner, we can return the gas to its original volume. The complete cycle of expan-
sion and compression in this hypothetical process, moreover, is accomplished without 
any net change to the surroundings.
From these and other examples we learn two important facts:
t Because real processes can at best only approximate the inÔ¨Ånitesimal changes associ-
ated with reversible processes, all real processes are irreversible.
t Because spontaneous processes are real processes, all spontaneous processes are irreversible.
Thus, for any spontaneous change, returning the system to its original condition results 
in a net ch
