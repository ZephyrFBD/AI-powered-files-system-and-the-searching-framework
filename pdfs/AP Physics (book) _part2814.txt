hat is
noncircular. There are two effects: coma (because the image of a point is comet-
shaped rather than a tiny circle) and off-axis astigmatism.† Furthermore, the
image points for objects off the axis but at the same distance from the lens do not
fall on a flat plane but on a curved surface—that is, the focal plane is not flat. (We
expect this because the points on a flat plane, such as the film in a camera, are not
equidistant from the lens.) This aberration is known as curvature of field and is
a problem in cameras and other devices where the sensor or film is a flat plane.
In the eye, however, the retina is curved, which compensates for this effect.
