Photochemical Reactions in the Atmosphere
Although the atmosphere beyond the stratosphere contains only a small fraction of 
the atmospheric mass, it forms the outer defense against the hail of radiation and high- 
energy particles that continuously bombard Earth. As the bombarding radiation passes 
through the upper atmosphere, it causes two kinds of chemical changes: photodisso-
ciation and photoionization. These processes protect us from high-energy radiation by 
absorbing most of the radiation before it reaches the troposphere. If it were not for these 
photochemical processes, plant and animal life as we know it could not exist on Earth.
