orming tightly packed sheets, which leaves some spaces
between the fatty acid chains. Saturated fats, on the other hand, are straight chains; they form tightly packed
sheets and have less space between their fatty acid chains. Since unsaturated fats cannot pack tightly like
saturated fats, this allows unsaturated fats to be more flexible and thus be liquid at room temperature.
12. (a) The Tm of DNA from organism A is lower than the Tm of DNA from organism B.
(b) The Tm of poly-GC DNA is much higher than the Tm of poly-AT DNA.
(c) DNA from organism B has a GC content of 48% and a Tm of approximately 85° Celsius. Since increased
GC content leads to a higher Tm and the DNA from organism C has a GC content of 55%, it would follow
the pattern of the data that organism C’s Tm would be higher than 85° Celsius.
(d) In DNA, GC pairs form three hydrogen bonds while AT pairs form only two hydrogen bonds. More
hydrogen bonds would require more energy to separate, so it makes sense that DNA with a
