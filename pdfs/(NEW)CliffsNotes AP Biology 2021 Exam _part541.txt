many of these animals may feel cold to the touch they are called “cold-blooded” animals, but many land-dwelling
ectotherms can exceed ambient temperatures by basking in the sun.
2. Endotherms are animals that generate their own body heat. They maintain a constant internal temperature and are
often referred to as “warm-blooded” because their temperature is relatively warm compared to ectotherms.
Mammals and birds are endotherms.
Animals regulate their body temperatures by employing the following mechanisms:
1. Cooling by evaporation. Many animals lose heat by sweating. Since changing from a liquid to gaseous state
requires energy (an endergonic reaction), body heat is removed when water vaporizes. Evaporative heat loss also
occurs from the respiratory tract, a cooling process employed when animals pant.
2. Warming by metabolism. Muscle contraction and other metabolic activities generate heat in two ways.
 
Heat is generated by contracting muscle when animals shiver.
