such problems gives this field of statics even greater importance.

SECTION 9–1
The Conditions for Equilibrium
231
Statics is concerned with the calculation of the forces acting on and within
structures that are in equilibrium. Determination of these forces, which occupies
us in the first part of this Chapter, then allows a determination of whether the
structures can sustain the forces without significant deformation or fracture, sub-
jects we discuss later in this Chapter. These techniques can be applied in a wide
range of fields. Architects and engineers must be able to calculate the forces on
the structural components of buildings, bridges, machines, vehicles, and other
structures, since any material will buckle or break if too much force is applied
(Fig. 9–1). In the human body a knowledge of the forces i
