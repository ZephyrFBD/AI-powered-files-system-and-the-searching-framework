 They record the
distribution of fruit flies as a function of distance to the cotton tip.
According to the graph, what can be concluded about the reaction
of fruit flies to ammonia, a strong base?

Ammonia does not elicit a strong response from fruit flies.
(A)
Ammonia paralyzes fruit flies as it diﬀuses through the
chamber.
(B)
Ammonia appears to attract and stimulate the fruit flies.
(C)
Ammonia is a volatile compound that repels fruit flies.

3. Plants are exposed to many threats from the environment,
including predators and diseases caused by infectious agents.
Warding oﬀ injury presents a distinct survival advantage. While
investigating the response of marigolds to predation by golden
beetles, researchers detected a noxious chemical compound that
