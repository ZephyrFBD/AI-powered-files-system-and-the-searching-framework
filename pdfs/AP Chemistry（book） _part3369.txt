Stanford linear accelerator, which is 2.0 
mi in length.
Figure 21.5(a) shows a cyclotron. In 
this device, charged particles move in 
a spiral path within two D-shaped elec-
trodes. Alternating charges on the elec-
trodes accelerate the particles, while 
magnets above and below the device 
constrain the particles to a spiral path 
of increasing radius. In a synchrotron, the 
magnetic fields are synchronized so that 
the particle moves in a circular rather 
than a spiral path. Figure 21.5(b) sh
