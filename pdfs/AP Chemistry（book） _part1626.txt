Give It Some Thought
Will these changes increase, decrease, or have no effect on the mean free path 
of the molecules in a gas sample?
(a) increasing pressure.
(b) increasing temperature.
*The rate at which the perfume moves across the room also depends on how well stirred the air 
is from temperature gradients and the movement of people. Nevertheless, even with the aid of 
these factors, it still takes much longer for the molecules to traverse the room than one would 
expect from their rms speed.
throughout a volume of space is much slower than molecular speeds.* This difference is 
due to molecular collisions, which occur frequently for a gas at atmospheric pressure—
about 1010 times per second for each molecule. Collisions occur because real gas mole-
