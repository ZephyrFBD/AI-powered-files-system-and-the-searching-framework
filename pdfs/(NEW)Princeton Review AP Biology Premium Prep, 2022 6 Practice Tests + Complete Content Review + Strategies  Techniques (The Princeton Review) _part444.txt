ulations also vary greatly. There are two types of growth: exponential growth and logistic
growth. Equations for both are included on the AP Biology Equations and Formulas sheet. Exponential growth
occurs when a population is in an ideal environment. Growth is unrestricted because there are lots of resources,
space, and no disease or predation. Here’s an example of exponential growth. Notice that the curve arches sharply
upward—the exponential increase.
Exponential growth can be calculated in the following way:
Exponential growth occurs very quickly, resulting in a J-shaped curve. A good example of exponential growth is the
initial growth of bacteria in a culture. There’s plenty of room and food, so they multiply rapidly.
The More Things Change, The More They Stay the Same
As with the equation for population growth, this may be presented to you on
the test as 
 = r−maxN. Be familiar with what each variable represents
However, as the bacterial population increases, the individual bacter
