 have imagined. Mendel was investigating the behavior of genes. He was fortunate in choosing traits coded
by genes that happened to be on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome. When genes are linked or
near each other on the same chromosome, patterns of segregation and independent assortment change. In 1913, Sturtevant
devised a method to assess recombination frequency and infer the relative positions and distances of linked genes on a
chromosome based on the average number of crossovers between them during meiosis.
The content presented in this section supports the Learning Objectives outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP速 Biology
Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives merge essential knowledge content with one or more of the seven
Science Practices. These objectives provide a transparent foundation for the AP速 Biology course, along with inquiry-based
laboratory experiences, instructional activities, and AP速 exam questions.
