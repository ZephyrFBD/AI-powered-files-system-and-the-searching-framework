If we toss more coins—say, 100 all at the same time—the relative probability
of throwing all heads (or all tails) is greatly reduced. There is only one microstate
corresponding to all heads. For 99 heads and 1 tail, there are 100 microstates
because each of the coins could be the one tail. The relative probabilities for other
macrostates are given in Table 15–3 (top of next page). About 
microstates are possible.† Thus the relative probability of finding all heads is
about 1 in 
an incredibly unlikely event! The probability of obtaining 50 heads
and 50 tails (see Table 15–3) is
or 8%. The
probability of obtaining anything between 45 and 55 heads is about 70%.

The Laws of Thermodynamics
†Each coin has two possibilities, heads or tails. Then the possible number of microstates is
(using a calculator or logarithms).
2 * 2 * 2 * p = 2100 = 1.3 * 1030
