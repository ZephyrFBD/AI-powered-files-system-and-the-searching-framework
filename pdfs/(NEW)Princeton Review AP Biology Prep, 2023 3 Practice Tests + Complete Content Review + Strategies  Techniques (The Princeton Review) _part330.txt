Strands
Each DNA molecule consists of two strands that wrap around each other to form a long, twisted ladder called a
double helix. The structure of DNA was brilliantly deduced in 1953 by three scientists: Watson, Crick, and
Franklin.
Now let’s look at the way two DNA strands get together. Again, think of DNA as a ladder. The sides of the ladder
consist of alternating sugar and phosphate groups, while the rungs of the ladder consist of pairs of nitrogenous bases.
The nitrogenous bases pair up in a particular way. Adenine in one strand always binds to thymine (A–T or T–A) in
the other strand. Similarly, guanine always binds to cytosine (G–C or C–G). This predictable matching of the bases
is known as base pairing.
The two strands are said to be complementary. This means that if you know the sequence of bases in one strand,
you’ll know the sequence of bases in the other strand. For example, if the base sequence in one DNA strand is A–T–
C, the base sequence in the complementary strand wil
