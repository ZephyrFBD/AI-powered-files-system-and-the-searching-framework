orrect nucleotide.
2. Mismatch repair proteins repair errors that escape the proofreading ability of DNA polymerase.
3. Excision repair proteins identify and remove damaged nucleotides caused by environmental factors, such as
toxins or radiation (UV, Xrays). A polymerase then uses the undamaged complementary strand as a template to
repair the damage.
Protein Synthesis
The DNA in chromosomes contains genetic instructions that regulate development, growth, and the metabolic
activities of cells. The DNA instructions determine whether a cell will be that of a pea plant, a human, or some other
organism, as well as establish specific characteristics of the cell in that organism. For example, the DNA in a cell
may establish that it is a human cell. If, during development, it becomes a cell in the iris of an eye, the DNA will
direct other information appropriate for its location in the organism, such as the concentration of melanin
pigmentation (which influences the appearance of different col
