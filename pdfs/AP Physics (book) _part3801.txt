r, is about 
times fainter than the
Sun. From this, estimate the distance to the nearest stars.
43. A certain pulsar, believed to be a neutron star of mass
1.5 times that of the Sun, with diameter 16 km, is observed
to have a rotation speed of 
If it loses rotational
kinetic energy at the rate of 1 part in 
per day, which is
all transformed into radiation, what is the power output of
the star?
44. The nearest large galaxy to our Galaxy is about 
away. If both galaxies have a mass of 
with
what gravitational force does each galaxy attract the other?
Ignore dark matter.
45. How large would the Sun be if its density equaled the criti-
cal density of the universe,
Express your
answer in light-years and compare with the Earth–Sun
distance and the diameter of our Galaxy.
46. Two stars, whose spectra peak at 660 nm and 480 nm,
respectively, both lie on the main sequence. Use Wien’s
law, the Stefan-Boltzmann equation, and the H–R diagram
(Fig. 33–6) to estimate the ratio of their diameters.
