19 Chemical Thermodynamics
In general, the entropy of any system increases as the system becomes 
more random or more spread out. Thus, we expect the spontaneous 
expansion of a gas to result in an increase in entropy. To see how this 
entropy increase can be calculated, consider the expansion of an ideal 
gas that is initially constrained by a piston, as in the rightmost part 
of Figure 19.4. Imagine that we allow the gas to undergo a reversible 
isothermal expansion by inﬁnitesimally decreasing the external pres-
sure on the piston. The work done on the surroundings by the revers-
ible expansion of the system against the piston can be calculated with 
the aid of calculus (we do not show the derivation):
wrev = -nRT  ln 
V2
V1
In this equation, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the ideal-gas 
constant 
 (Section 10.4), T is the absolute temperature, V1 is the 
initial volume, and V2 is the ﬁnal volume. Notice that if V2 7 V1, as it 
must be in our expansion, then wrev 6 0, meaning
