at the
beginning of prophase, you would see 46 differently sized chromosomes, and each one would be the shape of an X.
During interphase, individual chromosomes are not visible.
Condensed chromosomes are easier to separate and move around the cell,
compared to diffuse chromatin.
Reminder: Plants usually don’t have centrioles, but microtubules are still used
to pull the chromatids apart.
Now the cell has plenty of room to “sort out” the chromosomes. Remember centrioles? During prophase, these
cylindrical bodies found within microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) start to move away from each other,
toward opposite ends of the cell. The centrioles will spin out a system of microtubules known as the spindle fibers.
These spindle fibers will attach to a kinetochore, a structure on each chromatid. The kinetochores are part of the
centromere.
Another name for this MTOC in animal cells is the centrosome.
Stage 2: Metaphase: Middle (chromosomes align in the middle)
The next stage is called meta
