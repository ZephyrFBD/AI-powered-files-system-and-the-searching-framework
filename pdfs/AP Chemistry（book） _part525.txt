The chief constituent in eucalyptus oil is a substance called eu-
calyptol, which contains 77.87% C, 1
1.76% H, and the remain-
der O. (a) What is the empirical formula for this substance? 
 
(b) A mass spectrum of eucalyptol shows a peak at about 
 
154 amu. What is the molecular formula of the substance?
 3.95 Vanillin, the dominant flavoring in vanilla, contains C, H, 
and O. When 1.05 g of this substance is completely com-
busted, 2.43 g of CO2 and 0.50 g of H2O are produced. What 
is the empirical formula of vanillin?

 (c) HCN forms when synthetic fibers containing Orlon速 
or Acrilan速 burn. Acrilan速 has an empirical formula of 
CH2CHCN, so HCN is 50.9% of the formula by mass. A rug 
measures 12 * 15 ft and contains 30 oz of Acrilan速  
fibers per 
square yard of carpet. If the rug burns, will a lethal dose of 
HCN be generated in the room? Assume that the yield of HCN 
from the fibers is 20% an
