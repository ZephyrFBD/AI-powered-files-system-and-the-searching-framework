If the nucleolus were not able to carry out its function, what other cellular organelles would be affected? Would a
human liver cell that lacked endoplasmic reticulum be able to metabolize toxins?

Antibiotics are medicines that are used to fight bacterial infections. These medicines kill prokaryotic cells without
harming human cells. What part(s) of the bacterial cell do antibiotics target and provide reasoning for your
answer.
Section Summary
Like a prokaryotic cell, a eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes, but a eukaryotic cell is
typically larger than a prokaryotic cell, has a true nucleus (meaning its DNA is surrounded by a membrane), and has other
membrane-bound organelles that allow for compartmentalization of functions. The plasma membrane is a phospholipid
bilayer embedded with proteins. The nucleus’s nucleolus is the site of ribosome assembly. Ribosomes are either found in
the cytoplasm or attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma mem
