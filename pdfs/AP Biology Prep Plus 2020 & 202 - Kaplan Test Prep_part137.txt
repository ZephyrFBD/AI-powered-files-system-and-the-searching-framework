 one stack to the next until
they reach the trans Golgi. In the trans Golgi, proteins are sorted into
vesicles based on signals in diﬀerent proteins that indicate their final
destination. The nature of the signal varies but includes the protein’s
primary sequence, structure, and post-translational modifications. Once
packaged into vesicles, the vesicles move on to their final destination. 
The final destination for a protein may include the lysosome, the plasma
membrane, or the exterior of the cell. Some proteins are retained in the
Golgi or the ER. Proteins that are destined for the plasma membrane as
transmembrane proteins are inserted in the membrane in the ER as they
are synthesized, and they maintain their orientation in the membrane as
they move from the ER to the Golgi to the vesicle to the plasma
membrane. Proteins that are secreted from the cell are inserted in the ER
lumen during protein synthesis and remain in the lumen of the ER to the
Golgi, where they form secretory vesic
