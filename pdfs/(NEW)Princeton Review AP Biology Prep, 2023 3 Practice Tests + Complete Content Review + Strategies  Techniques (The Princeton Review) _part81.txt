beled graph to demonstrate the CO2 levels with changing
temperature. Please include all temperatures, timepoints, and error bars. (4 points)
(c) Identify which temperature was associated with the highest respiration rate in the crickets. (1 point)
The highest respiration rate was found at 35°C, as that showed the greatest increase over time.
(d) Predict what would happen to the CO2 levels in the chamber with an additional 5°C increase above the highest
temperature. Justify your prediction with evidence from the data. (2 points)
With a 5°C increase in temperature, the CO2 levels would increase to approximately 2100–2200ppm. This is
justified because the CO2 levels increased by approximately 500ppm each time the temperature increased by 15°C.
This means that a 5°C increase in temp would increase the CO2 levels by about 166ppm.
Question 3
(a) Explain how changing a single nucleotide can change the sequence of the protein.
Changing a nucleotide will change the codon, which is the group of
