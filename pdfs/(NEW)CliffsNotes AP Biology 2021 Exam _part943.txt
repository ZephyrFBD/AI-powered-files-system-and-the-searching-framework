ess of reactants (essentially, not enough enzyme to go around). Increasing the temperature could
increase the rate of reactions (in both directions), but if the reaction is in equilibrium, the net production of product
will still be zero.
16. C. Growing parts of an organism are good places to find mitosis. The apical meristems at the root tips and shoot
tips of plants have cells that are actively dividing by mitosis. In animals, mitotic divisions are visible in the early
(blastula stage) development of embryos. In contrast, a good place to observe meiosis is in a cross section of a plant
anther, where haploid pollen cells are being produced.
17. C. It is important that cells have a large surface area relative to their volume in order to maximize the ability of
cells to import necessary nutrients and export wastes. The greater the surface area is, the greater the area for carrying
out these processes. A large cell may not have enough surface area to accommodate the transport needs of th
