SOLUTION
Analyze For (a) we need to calculate the partial pressure of O2 given its 
mole percent and the total pressure of the mixture. For (b) we need to 
calculate the number of moles of O2 in the mixture given its volume 
(121 L), temperature (295 K),  and partial pressure from part (a).
 
 
 
 
 
Sample Exercise 10.11 
Relating Mole Fractions and Partial Pressures
A study of the effects of certain gases on plant growth requires a synthetic atmosphere composed of 1.5 mol % CO2, 18.0 mol % 
O2 and 80.5 mol % Ar. (a) Calculate the partial pressure of O2 in the mixture if the total pressure of the atmosphere is to be  
745 torr. (b) If this atmosphere is to be held in a 121-L space at 295 K, how many moles of O2 are needed?
Plan We calculate the partial pressures using Equation 10.16, and 
then use P
O2, V, and T in the ideal-gas equation to calculate the 
number of moles of O2.
