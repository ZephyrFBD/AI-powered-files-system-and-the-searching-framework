accidentally gets packaged into new viral particles with the viral
genome. The next cell that gets infected is not only getting infected with the viral genome, but also with that stolen
chunk of bacterial DNA. If that chunk held a gene for something like antibiotic resistance, the next cell that gets
infected will gain that trait. The transfer of DNA between bacterial cells using a lysogenic virus is called
transduction.
Viruses that infect animals do not have to break their way out of the cell the same way that a bacteriophage does.
Since animals’ cells don’t have a cell wall, viruses often just “bud” out of the membrane in a process similar to
exocytosis. When a virus does this, it becomes enveloped by a chunk of host cell membrane that it takes with it.
Viruses with a lipid envelope are called enveloped viruses.
Retroviruses like HIV are RNA viruses that use an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert their RNA
genomes into DNA so that they can be inserted into a host genome.
