Sample Exercise 20.4
Practice Exercise 2: (a) The ﬁrst reaction occurs at the anode and 
the second reaction at the cathode. (b) Zinc is oxidized to form 
Zn2+ as the reaction proceeds and therefore the zinc electrode loses 
mass. (c) The platinum electrode is not involved in the reaction 
and none of the products of the reaction at the cathode are solids, so 
the mass of platinum electrode does not change. (d) The platinum 
cathode is positive.
