B. Based on Khorana’s findings, calculate the relative
distributions of the following ratios of concentrations of
RNA triplet sequences from mixtures in which the relative
concentrations of guanine and cytosine, G:C, are 5:1.

C. Based on the work of Nirenberg, Matthaei, Leder, and
Khorana, the following table was constructed (taken from
Khorana's Nobel Prize address):
Figure 15.18
A solution containing the amino acids shown in the table
above and equal concentrations of the two nucleotides C
and G is prepared. Predict the proteins that can be
synthesized from this mixture in terms of each possible
codon and their relative concentrations in terms of their
amino acid repeat sequences.
D. Describe the effects of the codons UAA, UAG, and
UGA on protein synthesis.
