the 
relationship between the free-energy change under standard conditions, ∆G°, and the 
free-energy change under any other conditions, ∆G, is given by
 
∆G = ∆G° + RT ln Q 
[19.19]
In this equation R is the ideal-gas constant, 8.314 J>mol@K; T is the absolute temperature; 
and Q is the reaction quotient for the reaction mixture of interest. 
 (Section 15.6) 
Recall that the reaction quotient Q is calculated like an equilibrium constant, except that 
you use the concentrations at any point of interest in the reaction; if Q = K, then the 
reaction is at equilibrium. Under standard conditions, the concentrations of all the reac-
tants and products are equal to 1 M. Thus, under standard conditions Q = 1, ln Q = 0, 
and Equation 19.19 reduces to ∆G = ∆G° under standard conditions, as it should.
