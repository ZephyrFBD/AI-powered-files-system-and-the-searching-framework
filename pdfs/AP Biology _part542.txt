Although there are no complicated chemical equations and
molecular pathways in this chapter, you must connect some of the
concepts in this chapter with those from earlier chapters, namely,
photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and evolution.
Ecology is the study of the interactions of organisms and
populations with each other and with their physical environment.
The properties of populations are size, density, dispersion,
survivorship curves, and age structure diagrams.
A population is a group of individuals of one species living in one
area that have the ability to interact and interbreed with each other.
There are two categories of factors that limit the growth of any
population. One is density-dependent factors such as competition
for food, the buildup of wastes, predation, and disease. The other is

naturally occurring fires and floods. If a population experiences few
