Introduction
According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, approximately 95% of those who commit homicide are men.
While behavior is shaped by the environment one grows up and lives in, genetics also play a role. For example, scientists
have discovered genes that appear to increase one’s tendency to exhibit aggressive behavior. One of the genes, called
MAOA, is located on the X chromosome. In one recent study involving a group of male prisoners in Finland, scientists
found that the prisoners who inherited a variant of this gene were between 5% and 10% more likely to have committed a
violent crime. Men only have one copy of the gene, since men only have one X chromosome. Wom
