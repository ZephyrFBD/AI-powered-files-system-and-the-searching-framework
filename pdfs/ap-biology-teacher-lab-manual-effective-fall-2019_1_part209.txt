content from the process of evolution (big idea 1), 
but you’ll find that this lab will also fit nicely in genetics and information transfer (big 
idea 3), particularly after covering individual Mendelian inheritance patterns. As always, 
it is important to make connections between big ideas and enduring understandings, 
regardless of where in the curriculum the lab is taught. The concepts align with the 
enduring understandings and learning objectives from the AP Biology Curriculum 
Framework, as indicated below.  
■ Enduring Understanding 
•  EVO-1: Evolution is characterized by a change in the genetic makeup of a population 
over time and is supported by multiple lines of evidence.

■ Learning Objectives 
•  EVO-1.K: Describe the conditions under which allele and genotype frequencies will 
change in populations. 
•  EVO-1.L: Explain the impacts on the population if any of the conditions of Hardy-
Weinberg are not met.
