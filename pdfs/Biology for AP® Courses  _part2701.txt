ponse to gravity. Amyloplasts are found in shoots and in specialized cells of the root cap. When a plant is tilted, the
statoliths drop to the new bottom cell wall. A few hours later, the shoot or root will show growth in the new vertical
direction.
The mechanism that mediates gravitropism is reasonably well understood. When amyloplasts settle to the bottom of the
gravity-sensing cells in the root or shoot, they physically contact the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing the release of
calcium ions from inside the ER. This calcium signaling in the cells causes polar transport of the plant hormone IAA to
the bottom of the cell. In roots, a high concentration of IAA inhibits cell elongation. The effect slows growth on the lower
side of the root, while cells develop normally on the upper side. IAA has the opposite effect in shoots, where a higher
concentration at the lower side of the shoot stimulates cell expansion, causing the shoot to grow up. After the shoot or root
begin to grow verti
