bilizing selection shiȇs the phenotypes away from the extremes,
resulting in UV reflectance values somewhere in between species A and D.

According to the question, DNP dissipates the mitochondrial proton
gradient, which is essential for generating ATP via the ATP synthase.
Because there is less of a proton gradient, the rate of ATP production
should decrease, which allows you to eliminate (A). While the rate of ATP
production is decreased by DNP, this doesn’t impair the actions of the
electron transport chain, which will continue to oxidize NADH and FADH2
to NAD+ and FAD+ and consume oxygen. Thus, you will see an increase in
the concentration of NAD+ and a decrease in NADH concentration, which
eliminates (B) and (C). Therefore, (D) is correct.

A cross between a heterozygous yellow fish (Yy) and an orange fish (yy)
would yield an oﬀspring ratio of 1:1 between yellow- and orange-finned
fish. Of the 754 fish, it would be expected that 377 would be yellow and
377 would be oran
