d significantly different. Such a result often indicates that your expectations were wrong or your
data collection was faulty.
More typically, the value you calculate for χ2 will be between these two extremes. To determine whether the χ2
value obtained indicates that the
 
difference between the observed data and expected data occurred by
 
chance or because the expectations or data are wrong, a χ2 statistical
 
table is consulted (provided on the equations and formulas pages). If
 
chance explains 95% or more of the deviation of χ2 from zero, then the
experimental results are acceptable. If not, there are errors in the data collection or a problem with the expectations.
As an example, consider the trait of eye color in fruit flies, where red eyes (R) are dominant to brown (sepia) eyes
(r). A cross between a heterozygous red-eyed fly (Rr) and a brown-eyed fly (rr) is expected to produce ½
heterozygous red-eyed flies (Rr) and ½ brown-eyed flies (rr). What can you say about this investig
