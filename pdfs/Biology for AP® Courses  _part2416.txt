riptase before they
can reproduce.
d.
Group I viruses use DNA as their genome while
group VI use RNA. Group I viruses reproduce
by transcribing RNA from their DNA genome
while group VI viruses synthesize DNA from
RNA using reverse transcriptase before they can
reproduce.
44. The diagram below shows the stages during which a
virus infects a host cell. During which of the numbered
steps does the amount of viral genetic material begin to
change within the host cell and why?
a.
1; virus enters the cell
b.
2; virus RNA enters the nucleus
c.
3; new viruses assemble within the cell
d.
4; viruses leave the cell
45. The diagram below shows the stages during which a
virus infects a host cell. How could the influenza virus
change the function of a host cell? Which has the potential
to produce the most copies of the virus?

a.
Because it replicates its DNA within the cell and
reproduces, which could interfere with cell
processes.
b.
Because it replicates RNA within the cell
