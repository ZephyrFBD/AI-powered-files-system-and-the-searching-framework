but this lab might best be used to introduce the concept of natural selection. Think about 
how you wish to approach this as an instructor. 
■ Potential Challenges 
As with all long-term lab investigations, management of time and the calendar can be 
challenging. To coordinate with school calendars, start the investigation on a Monday 
or Tuesday. Make sure that the water reservoirs are full before every weekend. Keeping 
track of multiple sections and their various plants can present a challenge as well. You

different populations separate. 
In general, most classrooms have minimal plant pests, but if your classrooms have 
a large population of plants year-round, you may experience pest outbreaks in your 
Fast Plants®. Soapy water sponged on the plants controls some pests, such as wh
