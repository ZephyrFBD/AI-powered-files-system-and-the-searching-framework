oncentrated with salts. Next, the filtrate descends through the collecting duct toward the renal
pelvis. As it passes through the salts concentrated in the interstitial fluids, water passively moves out of the
collecting duct and into the interstitial fluids. When the filtrate drains into the renal pelvis, it is concentrated urine.
In order to maintain homeostasis, adequate amounts of water must be available to the organism. A need for
additional water may arise when water is lost through excessive sweating, when the digestive system struggles with
a bacterial infection (diarrhea), or even when very salty foods are ingested. To avoid dehydration, homeostasis is
maintained by the action of two hormones that influence osmoregulation by regulating the concentration of salts in
the urine, as follows:
1. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) increases the reabsorption of water by the body and increases the concentration of
salts in the urine. It does this by increasing the permeability of the collecti
