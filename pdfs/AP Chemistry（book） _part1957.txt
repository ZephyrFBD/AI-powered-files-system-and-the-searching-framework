we need to recall what we have learned about 
sp, sp2, and sp3 hybridization and geometry. 
 (Section 9.5) For 
part (b), we need to write a balanced equation. For part (c), we 
need to use the ideal-gas equation. 
 (Section 10.4) For part (d), 
we need to recall the definitions of endothermic and exothermic 
and how bond enthalpies can be used to predict overall reaction 
enthalpies. 
 (Section 8.8) For part (e), we need to relate the ab-
sorption of light to the differences in energy levels between filled 
and empty states in a material. 
 (Section 6.3)
Plan For part (a), we should draw out the chemical structures of 
the reactant and product. For part (b), we need to make sure the 
SOLUTION
equation is properly balanced. For part (c), we need to convert 
from liters of gas to moles of gas, using the ideal-gas equation 
1PV = nRT2; then we need to convert from moles of acetylene 
gas to moles of polyacetylene using the answer from part (b);  
finally, we can convert to grams of polya
