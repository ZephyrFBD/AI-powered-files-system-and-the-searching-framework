ATP in medium)
(a) Describe why a cell membrane is semipermeable. Include examples of molecules that can/cannot pass
through.
(b) Bacterial cells contain a Na+/K+ ATPase pump that helps them maintain an osmotic balance with their
surroundings. In the experimental cells, glycolysis was inhibited to prevent sodium from being pumped
out of the cell. Explain how the inhibition of glycolysis likely achieves this.
(c) Analyze the data and explain how the levels of glucose and sodium inside the cell change throughout the
experiment.
(d) Predict what would happen if the level of sodium inside the cell was not relatively low at the onset of the
experiment.
2. Basking sharks, which can grow up to 10 m in length, have been recorded jumping out of the water as high and
as fast as great white sharks. Marine biologists are unsure why they do this but have pointed to this
phenomenon as evidence of how much we still have to learn about marine life. The sharks are speculated to
jump out of the water on
