. There are two types of bone tissue:
compact and spongy.
Compact Bone Tissue
Compact bone (or cortical bone) forms the hard external layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity, or bone
marrow. It provides protection and strength to bones. Compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian
systems. Osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi,
which transport blood. They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone. Each osteon consists of lamellae, which are
layers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal. The Haversian canal (osteonic canal)
contains the boneâ€™s blood vessels and nerve fibers (Figure 29.19). Osteons in compact bone tissue are aligned in the same
direction along lines of stress and help the bone resist bending or fracturing. Therefore, compact bone tissue is prominent in
areas of bone at which stresses are applied in only a few directions.
