cally significant difference between the mean number of spots per guppy in the
environments without predators and in the environment with C. alta. This claim is supported by the data
because the 95% confidence intervals of the two groups do not overlap.
(d) If the guppies were moved out of the environment that had the predator C. alta and were placed into an
environment without predators, over time, it would be expected that the mean number of spots per male
guppy would increase. This is because there would no longer be a disadvantage to having spots, and spots
would attract mates, increasing the likelihood that the guppies with spots would reproduce.

Overview
Evolution is driven by both random and nonrandom events. Mutations are random, but natural selection, which acts
upon the phenotypes that result from those mutations, is not a random pro
