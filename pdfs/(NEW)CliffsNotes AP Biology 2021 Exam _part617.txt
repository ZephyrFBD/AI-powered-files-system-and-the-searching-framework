 it is relative to the rest of the embryo and stimulates gene expression appropriate to the specific
cell.
7. D. Methylation is the process in which methyl groups attach to amino acids in the histone proteins that serve to
pack DNA into tight, condensed strands. Methyl groups make it more difficult for the DNA to unwind, thus
inhibiting DNA expression.
Some Typical Answers to Short Questions
1. Should implantation occur, the implanted embryo secretes human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The hCG
maintains the corpus luteum, preventing it from deteriorating and allowing it to continue its production of estrogen
and progesterone. Later during development, the placenta secretes the progesterone.
2. Apoptosis is a planned, orderly process in which proteases break down cellular structures. Fragments of these
structures remain packaged inside membranes, allowing for easy phagocytosis by neighboring cells.
