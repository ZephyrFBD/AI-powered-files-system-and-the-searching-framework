Taking your temperature. Normal body temperature is
98.6°F. What is this on the Celsius scale?
APPROACH We recall that
and that a change of
SOLUTION First we relate the given temperature to the freezing point of water
(0°C). That is, 98.6°F is
above the freezing point of water.
Since each F° is equal to 
this corresponds to 
Celsius
degrees above the freezing point. The freezing point of water is 0°C, so normal
body temperature is 37.0°C.
