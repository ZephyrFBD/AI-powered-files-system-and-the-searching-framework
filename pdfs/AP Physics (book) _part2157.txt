19â€“8 Ammeters and Voltmeters
59. (I) (a) An ammeter has a sensitivity of 
What
current in the galvanometer produces full-scale deflection?
(b) What is the resistance of a voltmeter on the 250-V scale
if the meter sensitivity is 
60. (II) An ammeter whose internal resistance is 
reads
5.25 mA when connected in a circuit containing a battery and
two resistors in series whose values are 
and 
What is the actual current when the ammeter is absent?
61. (II) A milliammeter reads 35 mA full scale. It consists of a
resistor in parallel with a 
galvanometer. How
can you change this ammeter to a voltmeter giving a full-scale
reading of 25 V without taking the ammeter apart? What
will be the sensitivity 
of your voltmeter?
62. (II) A galvanometer has an internal resistance of 
and
deflects full scale for a 
current. Describe how to
