a.
Ferns are considered early colonizers as they
grow fast on poor soil and reproduce rapidly.
Also, mass extinction gave an opportunity for
the surviving species to expand and radiate to
occupy vacated niches.
b.
Ferns, having a selective advantage of being
early colonizers, grew fast on poor soil and
reproduced rapidly, thus replaced angiosperms in
the landscape.
c.
Ferns are considered early colonizers as they
grow fast on poor soil and reproduce rapidly.
Also, mass extinction gave an opportunity for
new species to radiate and thereby occupy
vacated niches.
d.
Most of the fern varieties became extinct, only a
single species survived; therefore, the remaining
fern spores had many vacated niches to occupy
which
