iner would stay the same; in fact, that was the independent
variable. Decreasing the number of females would not mean that the container could not be changed for a
new experiment. The graph shows that both samples have a reproduction rate decrease after 10–20 days,
so not (C). The highest density condition (same number of Daphnia but lower volume) shows no
reproductive activity after trauma (so not (D)). Choice (B) is the correct answer because as the container
size increased, the number of offspring increased.

Hydrophobic things, such as carbon dioxide, don’t have gap junctions since they are not restricted by lipid
bilayer membranes. They will simply diffuse from high concentrations to low concentrations. Hydrophilic
things need the gap junctions, but they will never diffuse through them up their concentration gradient.

A regular somatic cell after mitosis is just a regular somatic cell. The passage says 32, compared with 46
in humans. This means that there should be 32 unr
