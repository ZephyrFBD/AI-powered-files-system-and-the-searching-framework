smosis, and plasmolysis.
In animal cells, the direction of osmosis, in or out of a cell, depends on the concentration of solutes inside and
outside the plasma membrane. In plant cells, however, osmosis is also influenced by turgor pressure, the internal
pressure of water exerted on the cell wall. To account for differences in both concentration and pressure, a more
general term, water potential, is used to describe the tendency of water to move across a selectively permeable
membrane. Water potential is the sum of the pressure potential (from any externally applied force) and the solute
potential (osmotic potential):
Water potential has the following properties:
 
1. Water moves across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower
water potential.
 
2. Water potential can be positive or negative. Negative water potential is called tension.
 
3. In a living cell, water potential is always zero or negative.
4. Solute potential results from th
