reciprocals—don’t forget to take the reciprocal.

1. Draw a ray diagram, as precise as possible, but even
a rough one can serve as confirmation of analytic
results. Choose one point on the object and draw at
least two, or preferably three, of the easy-to-draw
rays described in Figs. 23–37 and 23–39. The image
point is where the rays intersect.

Object close to converging lens. An object is placed
10 cm from a 15-cm-focal-length converging lens. Determine the image position
and size (a) analytically, and (b) using a ray diagram.
APPROACH The object is within the focal point—closer to the lens than the
focal point F as 
We first use Eqs. 23–8 and 23–9 to obtain an analytic
solution, and then confirm with a ray diagram using the spec
