ecules from areas of low concentration to areas of high concentration, as shown in
Figure 5.15. This movement of molecules “against” their gradient requires the input of energy.
One example of this is the Na+/K+ pump. This membrane protein requires the input of ATP to pump Na+ ions
from their lower concentrations in the cell to an area of higher Na+ concentration outside the cell. This membrane
protein also pumps K+ ions from their lower concentrations outside of the cell to an area with higher concentrations
of K+ ions inside the cell. For every three Na+ ions pumped out of the cell, two K+ ions are pumped into the cell.
This results in a higher concentration of positive ions outside of the cell and helps the cell maintain a membrane
potential.

Endocytosis and exocytosis also require an input of energy and are forms of active transport. Endocytosis is used by
the cell to take in water and macromolecules by enfolding them into vesicles formed from the plasm
