 that run almost parallel to the ground, or just below the surface, and can give rise to new plants at the
nodes. Runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals:
strawberries are an example. Tubers are modified stems that may store starch, as seen in the potato (Solanum sp.). Tubers
arise as swollen ends of stolons, and contain many adventitious or unusual buds (familiar to us as the “eyes” on potatoes). A
bulb, which functions as an underground storage unit, is a modification of a stem that has the appearance of enlarged fleshy
leaves emerging from the stem or surrounding the base of the stem, as seen in the iris.
Figure 23.13 Stem modifications enable plants to thrive in a variety of environments. Shown are (a) ginger (Zingiber
officinale) rhizomes, (b) a carrion flower (Amorphophallus titanum) corm (c) Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) stolons,
(d) strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) runners, (e) potato (Solanum tuberosum)
