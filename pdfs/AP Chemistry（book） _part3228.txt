e species at the anode has been 
different from the reactive species at the cathode. Cell emf depends on concentration, 
however, so a voltaic cell can be constructed using the same species in both half-cells 
as long as the concentrations are different. A cell based solely on the emf generated 
because of a difference in a concentration is called a concentration cell.
An example of a concentration cell is diagrammed in Figure 20.14(a). One 
half-cell consists of a strip of nickel metal immersed in a 1.00 * 10-3 M solution of 
Ni2+1aq2. The other half-cell also has an Ni(s) electrode, but it is immersed in a 1.00 
M solution of Ni2+1aq2. The two half-cells are connected by a salt bridge and by an 
Comment A voltaic cell whose cell reaction involves H+ can be used 
to measure 3H+4 or pH. A pH meter is a specially designed voltaic cell 
with a voltmeter calibrated to read pH directly.
