IST-1.N.1
The sequence of the RNA bases, together with 
the structure of the RNA molecule, determines 
RNA functionâ€”
a. mRNA molecules carry information from 
DNA to the ribosome.
b. Distinct tRNA molecules bind specific amino 
acids and have anti-codon sequences that 
base pair with the mRNA. tRNA is recruited to 
the ribosome during translation to generate 
the primary peptide sequence based on the 
mRNA sequence.
c. rRNA molecules are functional building 
blocks of ribosomes.
IST-1.N.2
Genetic information flows from a sequence 
of nucleotides in DNA to a sequence of bases 
in an mRNA molecule to a sequence of amino 
acids in a protein.
IST-1.N.3
RNA polymerases use a single template strand 
of DNA to direct the inclusion of bases in the 
newly formed RNA molecule. This process is 
known as transcription.
