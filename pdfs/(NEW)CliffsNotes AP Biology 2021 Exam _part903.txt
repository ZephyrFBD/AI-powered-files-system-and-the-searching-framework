es to dissolve (ionize) and react.
1 pt: The cohesion of water molecules makes water a good medium for transporting dissolved molecules.
1 pt: The thermal qualities of water (large heat capacity) contribute to a stable temperature and a stable environment
for living things to originate.
1 pt: Because solid water (ice) floats, it provides insulation for the liquid water below, allowing life to continue in
the unfrozen water.
Question 7 (3 points maximum)
1 pt: Crossing over during meiosis mixes genetic information between homologous (parental) chromosomes.
1 pt: Independent assortment of homologues allows parental chromosomes to randomly mix for each offspring.
1 pt: Joining of gametes (sperm and egg) is mostly random, allowing many different possible gene combinations in
offspring.
Question 8 (3 points maximum)
1 pt: The nucleic acid component can be DNA or RNA.
1 pt: The nucleic acid component can be double stranded (dsDNA, dsRNA) or single stranded (ssDNA, ssRNA).
1 pt: Some RNA viru
