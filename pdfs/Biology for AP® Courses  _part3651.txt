23. What does FEV1/FVC measure and why will the ratio
increase with lung fibrosis?
a.
the forced expiratory volume in one second in
relation to the total forced vital capacity; lung
fibrosis causes the lungs to decrease in size
b.
the functional expiratory volume in one second
in relation to the total functional vital capacity;
lung fibrosis causes the lungs to decrease in size
c.
the functional expiratory volume in one second
in relation to the total functional vital capacity;
lung fibrosis causes the lungs to become less
pliable
d.
the forced expiratory volume in one second in
relation to the total forced vital capacity; lung
fibrosis causes the lungs to become less pliable
