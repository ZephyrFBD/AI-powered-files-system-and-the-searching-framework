3% of a humanâ€™s DNA is transcribed and translated.
(D) The trait for deposition of pigment (E) dominates the trait for the
production of coat color (B or b). If there is no dominant trait for
deposition, the animal will be yellow or golden. An animal with the
genotypes BBEe or BbEe will be black. An animal with the
genotypes bbEE or bbEe will be brown. However, the genotype
BBee will result in a yellow dog. This is an example of non-
Mendelian inheritance.
(C) Choices A and B refer to transcription of DNA. However, the
question asks about protein manufactured from an RNA molecule.
Choice D is incorrect because
