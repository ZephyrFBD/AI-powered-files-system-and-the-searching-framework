s: selecting for beneficial alleles and thus increasing their
frequency in the population, while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their frequency—a process
known as adaptive evolution. Natural selection does not act on individual alleles, however, but on entire organisms. An
individual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that, for example, increases the ability to
reproduce (fecundity), but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in a fatal childhood disease, that fecundity
phenotype will not be passed on to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age. Natural
selection acts at the level of the individual; it selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next
generation, known as an organism’s evolutionary (Darwinian) fitness.
Fitness is often quantifiable and is measured by scientists in the field. However, it is not the absolute fitness of an
