 a nuclear reaction where an energy E is required or released, the masses of the
reactants and the products will be different by 
Pion’s kinetic energy. A 
meson
travels at a speed 
What is its kinetic energy?
Compare to a classical calculation.
APPROACH We use Eq. 26–5 and compare to 
SOLUTION We substitute values into Eq. 26–5a
Notice that the units of 
are 
which is the joule.
NOTE Classically
about half as much, but this is not a correct result. Note that
also does
not work.
