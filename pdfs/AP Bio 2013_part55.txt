44. Which of the following descriptions of 
photosynthesis best explains the results of  
the experiment?

DCPIP depends on light energy. 
(B) Movement of DCPIP across chloroplast 
membranes occurs in less than 60 minutes. 
(C) Chlorophyll molecules degrade rapidly in the 
presence of DCPIP. 
(D) DCPIP can only be used to measure 
photosynthetic activity at low light levels.
