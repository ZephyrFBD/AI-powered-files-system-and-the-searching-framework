Explain how triploidy can arise in a previously diploid
organism. (1 point)
Predict ONE reason why a triploid organism might have a

Justify your prediction (from part (c)). (1 point)
The figure below represents the process of expression of the HBA1
gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-
globin (which is a component of a larger protein called hemoglobin).
This stretch of DNA is located on chromosome 16.
Describe the modification(s) that would take place in a cell that
would alter pre-RNA (primary transcript) to produce mature
mRNA, and state where in a cell this process occurs. (1 point)
A different protein, besides alpha-globin, can be made from
this same original stretch of DNA. Expla
