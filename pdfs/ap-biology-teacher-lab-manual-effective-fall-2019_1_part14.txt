them to develop and refine testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena. 
Because content, inquiry, and reasoning are equally important in AP Biology, each 
learning objective combines content with inquiry and reasoning skills described in the 
science practices. 
The key concepts and related content that define the revised AP Biology course and 
exam are organized around four underlying principles called the big ideas, which are as 
follows: 
Big Idea 1: The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life. 
Big Idea 2: Biological systems use energy and molecular building blocks to grow, 
to reproduce, and to maintain dynamic homeostasis. 
Big Idea 3: Living systems store, retrieve, transmit, and respond to information 
essential to life processes. 
Big Idea 4: Biological systems interact, and these systems and their interactions 
possess complex properties. 
These four big ideas will be referre
