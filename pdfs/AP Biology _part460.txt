e powerful. In contrast, the development
in the human skull seems to stop before those same changes happen.

Perhaps the genetic code for the morphology of the skull in chimps and
humans is identical. However, something signals the human skull genes to
stop developing sooner.

Heterochrony is also responsible for the slow growth of leg and pelvic
bones that led to the reduction and eventual loss of hind limbs in whales. It
can also alter the timing of reproductive development compared to the rest
of the body. One example is the adult aquatic salamander, the axolotl,
which retains juvenile structures—gills—into adulthood.
REMEMBER
There was no free oxygen in the ancient atmosphere.
THE ORIGIN OF LIFE
The ancient atmosphere consisted of CH4, NH3, CO, CO2, N2 and H2O,
but lacked free O2. There was probably intense lightning and ultraviolet
(UV) radiation that penetrated the primitive atmosphere, providing en
