ince its development in the 1920s, quantum mechanics has had a profound
influence on our lives, both intellectually and technologically. Even the way
we view the world has changed, as we have seen in the last few Chapters.
Now we discuss how quantum mechanics has given us an understanding of the
structure of molecules and matter in bulk, as well as a number of important applica-
tions including semiconductor devices and applications to biology. Semiconductor
devices, like transistors, now may be only a few atoms thick, which is the realm of
quantum mechanics.
29â€“1 Bonding in Molecules
One of the great successes of quantum mechanics was to give scientists, at last, an
understanding of the nature of chemical bonds. Because it is based in physics,
and because this understanding is so important in many fields, we discuss it here.
By a molecule, we mean a group of two or more atoms that are strongly held
together
