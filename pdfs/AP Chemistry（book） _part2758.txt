alues sometimes deviate appre-
ciably from those found experimentally. In part, these deviations are 
due to electrostatic interactions between ions in solution, which can 
lead to ion pairs. 
 (Section 13.5, “The van’t Hoff Factor”) These inter-
actions increase in magnitude both as the concentrations of the ions 
increase and as their charges increase. The solubility calculated from Ksp 
tends to be low unless corrected to account for these interactions.
As an example of the effect of these interactions, consider CaCO3 
(calcite), whose solubility product, 4.5 * 10-9, gives a calculated sol-
ubility of 6.7 * 10-5 mol>L; correcting for ionic interactions in the 
solution yields 7.3 * 10-5 mol>L. The reported solubility, however, 
is 1.4 * 10-4 mol>L, indicating that there must be additional factors 
involved.
Another common source of error in calculating ion concentra-
tions from Ksp is ignoring other equilibria that occur simultaneously 
in the solution. It is possible, for example,
