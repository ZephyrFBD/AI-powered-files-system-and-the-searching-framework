omotes the design and application of 
chemical products and processes that are compatible with human health and that pre-
serve the environment. Green chemistry rests on a set of 12 principles:
1. Prevention It is better to prevent waste than to clean it up after it has been created.
2. Atom Economy  Methods to make chemical compounds should be designed to 
maximize the incorporation of all starting atoms into the final product.
3. Less Hazardous Chemical Syntheses  Wherever practical, synthetic methods 
should be designed to use and generate substances that possess little or no toxicity to 
human health and the environment.
4. Design of Safer Chemicals  Chemical products should be designed to minimze 
toxicity and yet maintain their desired function.
Chemistry And life Ocean Acidification
Seawater is a weakly basic solution, with pH values typically between 
8.0 and 8.3. This pH range is maintained through a carbonic acid buf-
fer system similar to the one in blood (see Equation 17.10
