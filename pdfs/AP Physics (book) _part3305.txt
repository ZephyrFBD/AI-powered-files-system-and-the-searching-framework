st as molecules are. In metals, the electrostatic force between
free electrons and positive ions helps form the metallic bond.
In the free-electron theory of metals, electrons occupy the
possible energy states according to the exclusion principle. At
all possible states are filled up to a maximum energy
level called the Fermi energy,
the magnitude of which is
typically a few eV. All states above 
are vacant at T = 0 K.

In a crystalline solid, the possible energy states for electrons
are arranged in bands. Within each band the levels are very
close together, but between the bands there may be forbidden
energy gaps. Good conductors are characterized by the highest
occupied band (the conduction band) being only partially full,
so lots of states are available to electrons to move about and
accelerate when a voltage is applied. In a good insulator, the
highest occu
