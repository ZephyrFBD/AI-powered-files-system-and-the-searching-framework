ologist Ivan Pavlov found that if a bell were rung just before dogs
were given food, they would, after repeated experiences, salivate in response to the bell ringing alone. Dogs
associated the ring of the bell (the substitute stimulus) with the presentation of food (the normal stimulus).
5. Trial-and-error learning (or operant conditioning) is another form of associative learning. It occurs when an
animal connects its own behavior with a particular environmental response. If the response is desirable (positive
reinforcement), the animal will repeat the behavior in order to elicit the same response (for example, to receive a
reward). If the response is undesirable (for example, painful), the animal will avoid the behavior. This is the basis
for most animal training by humans.
Psychologist B. F. Skinner trained rats to push levers to obtain food or avoid painful shocks. Learning acquired by
association can be forgotten or reversed if the performed behavior no longer elicits the expected
