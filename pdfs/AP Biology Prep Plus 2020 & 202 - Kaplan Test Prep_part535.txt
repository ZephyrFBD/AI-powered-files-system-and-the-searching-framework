RNA synthesized. Which of the following fluorescently labeled
compounds would give the most reliable measure of the amount
of newly synthesized RNA?
Deoxyribose adenine phosphate

2. Lactose fermenting strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae are
designated as lac+, whereas strains deficient in lactose
fermentation are designated as lac–. Extracts from lac+ cells are
incubated separately with three diﬀerent enzymes: extract A with
protease K (which digests proteins), extract B with DNases (w
