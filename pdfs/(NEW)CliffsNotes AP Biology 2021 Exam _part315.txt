t the time of
these experiments, it was known that phages, viruses that infect bacteria, consisted of DNA and protein. In the first
part of their experiment, geneticists Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase substituted radioactive sulfur for the sulfur in
the amino acids of the phage proteins and mixed these phages with E. coli bacteria. After separating the bacteria
from the growing medium using a centrifuge, they found the culture media, not the bacteria, were radioactive,
indicating that the phage proteins did not enter the bacteria. In the second part of the experiment, they substituted
radioactive phosphorous for the phosphorous in the phage DNA. Following the same procedure as in the first part of
the experiment, they found that the bacteria, not the growing media, were radioactive, indicating that the phage
DNA had entered the bacteria. In a follow-up experiment, the researchers found that infected radioactive bacteria
released new phages that were also radioactive. Hershey and Chase
