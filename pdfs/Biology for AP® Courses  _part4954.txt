d non-biological thinking ... humans will be
able to extend their limitations and ‘think in the cloud’ ... We’re going to put gateways to the
cloud in our brains ... We’re going to gradually merge and enhance ourselves ... In my view,
that’s the nature of being human – we transcend our limitations.
As the technology becomes vastly superior to what we are then the small proportion that is
still human gets smaller and smaller and smaller until it’s just utterly negligible.
The sales-pitch of Kurzweil and Cult-owned Silicon Valley is that
this would make us ‘super-human’ when the real aim is to make us
post-human and no longer ‘human’ in the sense that we have come
to know. The entire global population would be connected to AI and
become the centrally-controlled ‘hive-mind’ of externally-delivered
perceptions. The Smart Grid being installed to impose the Cult’s will
on the world is being constructed to allow particular locations – even
one location – to control the whole global system. Fr
