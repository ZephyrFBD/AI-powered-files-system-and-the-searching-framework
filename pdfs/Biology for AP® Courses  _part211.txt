and hydrogen can form either hydrocarbon chains or rings. Functional groups, such as –CH3 (methyl) and –COOH
(carboxyl), are groups of atoms that give specific properties to hydrocarbon chains or rings that define their overall chemical
characteristics and function. For example, the attachment of a carboxyl group (-COOH) makes a molecule more acidic,
whereas the presence of an amine group (NH2) makes a molecule more basic. (As we will explore in the next chapter, amino
acids have both a carboxyl group and an amine group.) Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula (i.e., same
kinds and numbers of atoms), but different molecular structures resulting in different properties or functions. (Don’t confuse
“isomer” with “isotope”!)
