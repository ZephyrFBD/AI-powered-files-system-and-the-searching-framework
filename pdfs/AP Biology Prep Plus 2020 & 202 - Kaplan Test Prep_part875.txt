tonic, and the 100% corn
syrup solution is hypertonic relative to the egg.
(b) The reaction of egg shells (calcium carbonate) with vinegar (4% acetic
acid) produces a water-soluble compound (calcium acetate) and carbon
dioxide gas. Explain why, prior to the experiment, students placed eggs in
vinegar overnight. (2 points)
Explanation (2 points)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Vinegar dissolved the eggshells and exposed the semi-permeable membrane of
the eggs. The semi-permeable eggs could then be used to examine how
hypertonic, hypotonic, and isotonic conditions affect osmosis.
(c)Â According to the data, determine the approximate percentage of corn
syrup at which the solution would be isotonic to the egg. Justify your
response. (2 points)
The reaction of calcium carbonate with vinegar dissolved the eggshells (exposing the semi-
permeable membrane of the eggs) so osmosis through the egg could be examined
