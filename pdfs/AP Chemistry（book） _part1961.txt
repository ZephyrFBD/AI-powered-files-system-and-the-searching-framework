 = 3.06 * 10-19 J
We recognize that this energy corresponds to the energy 
difference between the bottom of the conduction band and 
the top of the valence band, and so is equivalent to the band 
gap Eg. Now we have to convert the number to electron volts. 
Since 1.602 * 10-19 J = 1 eV, we ﬁnd that:
 Eg = 1.91 eV

The structures and properties of solids can be classified according 
to the forces that hold the atoms together. Metallic solids are held 
together by a delocalized sea of collectively shared valence elec-
trons. Ionic solids are held together by the mutual attraction between 
cations and anions. Covalent-network solids are held together by 
an extended network of covalent bonds. Molecular solids are held 
together by weak intermolecula
