This is Eq. 7–3. The total momentum is conserved.
We have put this derivation in the context of a collision. As long as no exter-
nal forces act, it is valid over any time interval, and conservation of momentum is
always valid as long as no external forces act on the chosen system. In the real world,
external forces do act: friction on billiard balls, gravity acting on a tennis ball, and so
on. So we often want our “observation time” (before and after) to be small.
When a racket hits a tennis ball or a bat hits a baseball, both before and after the
“collision”the ball moves as a projectile under the action of gravity and air resistance.
