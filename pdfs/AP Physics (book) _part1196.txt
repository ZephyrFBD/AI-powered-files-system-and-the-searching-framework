1–9 Energy Transported by Waves
Waves transport energy from one place to another. As waves travel through a
medium, the energy is transferred as vibrational energy from particle to particle
of the medium. For a sinusoidal wave of frequency f, the particles move in SHM
as a wave passes, so each particle has an energy
where A is the
amplitude of its motion, either transversely or longitudinally. See Eq. 11–4a.
Thus, we have the important result that the energy transported by a wave is
proportional to the square of the amplitude. The intensity I of a wave is defined
as the power (energy per unit time) transported across unit area perpendicular 
to the direction of energy flow:
The SI unit of intensity is watts per square meter 
Since the energy is
proportional to the wave amplitude squared, so too is the intensity:
