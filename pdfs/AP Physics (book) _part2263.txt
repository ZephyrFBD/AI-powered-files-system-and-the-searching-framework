of these statements are valid.
12. Two parallel wires are vertical. The one on the left carries
a 10-A current upward. The other carries 5-A current down-
ward. Compare the magnitude of the force that each wire
exerts on the other.
(a) The wire on the left carries twice as much current, so
it exerts twice the force on the right wire as the right
one exerts on the left one.
(b) The wire on the left exerts a smaller force. It creates a
magnetic field twice that due to the wire on the right;
and therefore has less energy to cause a force on the
wire on the right.
(c) The two wires exert the same force on each other.
(d) Not enough information; we need the length of the wire.
20–3 Force on Electric Current in Magnetic Field
1. (I) (a) What is the force per meter of length on a straight
wire carrying a 6.40-A current when perpendicular to
a 0.90-T uniform magnetic field? (b) What if the angle
between the wire and field is 35.0°?
2. (I) How much current is flowing in a wire 4.80 m long if th
