stems comprise parts that 
interact with one another. These interactions result in characteristics and 
emergent properties not found in the individual parts alone. All biological 
systems from the molecular level to the ecosystem level exhibit properties 
of biocomplexity and diversity. These two properties provide robustness to 
biological systems, enabling greater resiliency and flexibility to tolerate and 
respond to changes in the environment.
