page 903 The mass number decreases by 4. page 905 Beta 
decay page 909 From Figure 21.3 we can see that each of these four 
elements has only one stable isotope, and from their atomic numbers 
we see that they each have an odd number of protons. Given the rar-
ity of stable isotopes with odd numbers of neutrons and protons, we 
expect that each isotope will possess an even number of neutrons. 
From their atomic weights we see that this is the case: F (10 neutrons), 
Na (12 neutrons), Al (14 neutrons), and P (16 neutrons). page 915 
It doubles as well. The number of disintegrations per second is pro-
portional to the number of atoms or the radioactive isotope. page

the rate of gaseous effusion (Section 10.8) page 921 The values in 
Table 21.7 only reflect the mass of the nucleus,
