terpret information, solve problems, and make decisions — that 
you will need in order to explore the investigative topic adequately. 
The quantitative skills you’ll apply as you carry out the investigations in this 
lab manual are for the most part the same skills you have been acquiring in your 
mathematics courses. For many of the skills required in these labs, you already

of those math skills. Your teacher can help to guide you as you supplement and review 
the quantitative skills required for the various laboratory investigations in this manual.
