re
classification scheme and is based on how messenger RNA (mRNA) is generated in each particular type of virus.
Past Systems of Classification
Viruses are classified in several ways: by factors such as their core content (Table 21.1 and Figure 21.3), the structure
of their capsids, and whether they have an outer envelope. The type of genetic material (DNA or RNA) and its structure
(single- or double-stranded, linear or circular, and segmented or non-segmented) are used to classify the virus core
structures.
Virus Classification by Genome Structure and Core
Core Classifications
Examples
RNA
DNA
Rabies virus, retroviruses
Herpesviruses, smallpox virus
Single-stranded
Double-stranded
Rabies virus, retroviruses
Herpesviruses, smallpox virus
Linear
Circular
Rabies virus, retroviruses, herpesviruses,
smallpox virus
Papillomaviruses, many bacteriophages
Non-segmented: genome consists of a single segment of
genetic material
Segmented: genome is divided into multiple segments
