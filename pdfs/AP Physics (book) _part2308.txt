 B; (2) by changing the area A of the loop in the field;
or (3) by changing the loop’s orientation with respect to the field. Figures 21–1
and 21–2 showed case 1. Cases 2 and 3 are illustrated in Figs. 21–5 and 21–6.

2. The magnetic field due to the induced current:
(a) points in the same direction as the external field if
the flux is decreasing; (b) points in the opposite direc-
tion from the external field if the flux is increasing;
or (c) is zero if the flux is not changing.
3. Once you know the direction of the induced magnetic
field, use right-hand-rule-1 (page 563, Chapter 20) to
find the direction of the induced current.
4. Always keep in mind that there are two magnetic
fields: (1) an external field whose flux must be
changing if it is to induce an electric current, and
(2) a magnetic field produced by the induced current.
