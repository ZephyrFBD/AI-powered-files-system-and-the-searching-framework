, that live in/on the human body. Sites
of colonization include the skin, nasal passages, mouth, and gut. Links between the microbiome and many
different conditions, such as allergies, obesity, depression, and many others have been suggested. During
antibiotic use, the body can often suffer repercussions due to the destruction of the natural microbiome. The
bacterial community composition varies greatly between body sites. Even among the skin microbiome, there is
a great variety in the amounts and types of bacteria found in different locations.

An experiment was performed to assess the results of skin bacterial transplants to alternative sites of the body.
A 2-inch square area of interdigital skin was swabbed with a sterile swab to collect bacteria. An additional
swab was opened but not touched to the skin. Each swab was then rubbed on either an alternate skin site or the
same type of skin si
