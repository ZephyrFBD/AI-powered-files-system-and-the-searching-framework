good example, as are wheat, rice, and corn). Some plants have a combination of tap roots and fibrous roots. Plants that grow

in dry areas often have deep root systems, whereas plants growing in areas with abundant water are likely to have shallower
root systems.

small roots. (credit b: modification of work by “Austen Squarepants”/Flickr)
Root Growth and Anatomy
Root growth begins with seed germination. When the plant embryo emerges from the seed, the radicle of the embryo forms
the root system. The tip of the root is protected by the root cap, a structure exclusive to roots and unlike any other plant
structure. The root cap is continuously replaced because it gets damaged easily as the root pushes through soil. The root tip
can be divided into three zones: a zone of cell division, a zone o
