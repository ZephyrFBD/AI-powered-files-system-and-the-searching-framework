tion reset the hypothalamus to a
higher temperature setpoint. Physiological responses such as
shivering raise the core temperature to match the new setpoint. Thus,
even when the child has a temperature higher than normal, she will
experience symptoms like chills and shivering until her body reaches
the new setpoint of 40°C. (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because
sweating only occurs when physiological temperature is above the
setpoint. (C) is incorrect because the child will feel cold, not hot, until
her body reaches the adjusted setpoint. (D) is incorrect because these
are responses to dehydration, such as might happen when someone
sweats profusely, which is not expected in this set of circumstances.

Endergonic reactions happen all the time in cells because they are
coupled with exergonic reactions. Reaction X, which is endergonic,
could proceed in a cell if coupled with reaction Y, which is exergonic.
(D) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because
