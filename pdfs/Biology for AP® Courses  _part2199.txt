radually across an ecological gradient. For
example, endothermic animals tend to have
larger bodies in the cooler climates closer to the
earth’s poles, allowing them to better conserve
heat.
b.
A cline is a change in ecological conditions over
a geographic distance. For example, a latitudinal
cline is the decrease in temperature towards the
Earth’s poles, and an altitudinal cline is the
decrease in temperature with increase in altitude.
c.
A cline is the specific set of traits in a population
of a given species that have been influenced by
the local environment. For example, a
population of warm-blooded animals that lived
in a cooler climate closer to the North Pole
would have larger bodies, allowing them to
better conserve heat.
d.
A cline is the specific set of ecological
conditions in a geographic region. For example,
towards the North Pole it is cold and there is
little precipitation. This will influence the traits
of the organisms that live there.
