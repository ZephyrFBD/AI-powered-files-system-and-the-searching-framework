up by electrons; eliminate (A). Glucose is made during photosynthesis, so
eliminate (B). NADH is an energy-rich molecule, which accepts electrons during the Krebs cycle.
Therefore, (D) is incorrect as well.

A
The oxygen released during the light reaction comes from splitting water. (Review the reaction for
photosynthesis.) Therefore, water must have originally contained the radioactive oxygen. Carbon dioxide
is involved in the dark reaction and produces glucose, so eliminate (B). Glucose is the final product and
would not be radioactive unless carbon dioxide was the radioactive material, so (C) is incorrect. Finally,
eliminate (D), because nitrogen is not part of photosynthesis.

D
A ligand binding to a receptor and causing a cellular response is signal transduction. In this case, the
ligand is the pheromone and the response is increased expression of transcription factors. All other
answers do not make sense in this context.

Homologous structures are organisms with the sa
