less
than about three solar masses, the subsequent evolution of the neutron star is
thought to resemble that of a white dwarf. If the mass is greater than this
(original mass
solar masses), the neutron star collapses under gravity,
overcoming even neutron degeneracy. Gravity would then be so strong that
emitted light could not escape—it would be pulled back in by the force of 
gravity. Since no radiation could escape from such a “star,” we could not see it—
it would be black. An object may pass by it and be deflected by its gravitational
field, but if the object came too close it would be swallowed up, never to escape.
This is a black hole.
Novae and Supernovae
Novae (singular is nova, meaning “new” in Latin) are faint stars that have sud-
denly increased in brightness by as much as a factor of 
and last for a month or
two before fading. Novae are thought to be faint white dwarfs that have pulled
mass from a nearby companion (they make up a binary system), as illustrated in
Fig. 33–10.
