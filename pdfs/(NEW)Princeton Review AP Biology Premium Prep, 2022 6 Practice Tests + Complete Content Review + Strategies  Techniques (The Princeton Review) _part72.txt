C
According to the table, the average carrot mass was stable around 60 grams, but the carrot length
decreased by almost 4 cm over time.

C
If a weevil lived at 17 cm, the carrots that are longer than 17 cm would not survive. The shorter carrots
would be untouched by the weevils and have more evolutionary fitness. The shorter carrots would be
naturally selected for over time and the short trait would become more prevalent in the population.

B
By removing the weevil population, any long carrots would have the chance to thrive. Additionally, by
crossing the longest carrots, the genotypes that promote carrot length will be selected for. Since all of the
carrots are longer than 10 cm, a predator at 10 cm would still be able to prey on the carrots.

B
If the carrot became shorter, the weevil population would still survive as long as the radish supply was
sufficient. Without the radishes, the weevils that lived at those depths
