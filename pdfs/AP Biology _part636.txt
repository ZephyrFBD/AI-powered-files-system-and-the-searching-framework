DIGESTION IN HUMANS
The human digestive system has two important functions: digestion
(breaking down large food molecules into smaller usable molecules) and
absorption (the diffusion of these smaller molecules in the bodyâ€™s cells).
Fats get broken down into glycerol and fatty acids, starch into
monosaccharides, nucleic acids into nucleotides, and proteins into amino
acids. Vitamins and minerals are small enough to be absorbed without
being digested. The digestive tract is about 30 feet (9 m) long and made of
smooth (involuntary) muscle that pushes the food along the digestive
tract by a process called peristalsis.
Mouth
In the mouth, the tongue and differently shaped teeth work together to
break down food mechanically. Form relates to function, and the type of
teeth a mammal has reflects its dietary habits. Humans are omnivores and
have three different types o
