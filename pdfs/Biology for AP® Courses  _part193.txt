Identify the red and white balls in the model and explain how arrangement of the molecules supports the fact that ice
floats on water.
a.
Red and white balls represent oxygen and hydrogen, respectively, loose arrangement of molecules results in
low density of ice
b.
Red and white balls represent oxygen and hydrogen respectively, tightly packed arrangement of molecules
results in a low density of ice
c.
Red and white balls represent hydrogen and oxygen, respectively, loose arrangement of molecules results in
low density of ice
d.
Red and white balls represent oxygen and hydrogen, respectively, tightly packed arrangement of molecules
results in high density o
