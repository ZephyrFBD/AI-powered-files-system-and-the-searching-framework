+ has zero 
nonbonding electron pairs on N and the largest bond angles. (b) NH2
- 
has two nonbonding electron pairs on N and the smallest bond angles. 
9.33 (a) Although both ions have 4 bonding electron domains, the 
6 total domains around Br require octahedral domain geometry and 
square-planar molecular geometry, while the 4 total domains about 
B lead to tetrahedral domain and molecular geometry. (b) The angles 
will vary as H2O 7 H2S 7 H2Se. The less electronegative the central 
atom, the larger the nonbonding electron domain, and the greater 
the effect of repulsive forces on adjacent bonding domains. The less 
electronegative the central atom, the greater the deviation from ideal 
tetrahedral angles. 9.35 A bond dipole is the asymmetric charg
