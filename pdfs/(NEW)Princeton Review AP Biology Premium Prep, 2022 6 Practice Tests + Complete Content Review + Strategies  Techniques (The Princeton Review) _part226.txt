would occur. You can always identify a competitive inhibitor based on what happens when you flood the system
with lots of substrate.
If the inhibitor binds to an allosteric site, it is an allosteric inhibitor and it is noncompetitive inhibition. A
noncompetitive inhibitor generally distorts the enzyme shape so that it cannot function. The substrate can still bind
at the active site, but the enzyme will not be able to catalyze the reaction.
Not all molecules that bind to the allosteric site of an enzyme are inhibitors.
Some enzymes are activated by allosteric regulators.
REACTION COUPLING AND ATP
As we just saw, almost everything an organism does requires energy. How, then, can the cell acquire the energy it
needs without becoming a major mess? Fortunately, itâ€™s through adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
ATP, as the name indicates, consists of a molecule of adenosine bonded to three phosphates. The great thing about
ATP is that an enormous amount of energy is packed into those phosphate bo
