depends on the thickness and area of the physical (macroscopic) target, on the
number of particles in the incident beam, and so on.

1–2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors
In 1938, the German scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann made an amazing
discovery. Following up on Fermi’s work, they found that uranium bombarded
by neutrons sometimes produced smaller nuclei that were roughly half the size 
of the original uranium nucleus. Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch quickly realized
what had happened: the uranium nucleus, after absorbing a neutron, actually had
split into two rough
