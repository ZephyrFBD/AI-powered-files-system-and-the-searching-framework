lication, explaining what is happening as they go. You can easily 
assess their understanding by observing the results of replication that students produce.

Think-Pair-Share  
Students build a model of transcription using pool noodles that can be purchased at 
a dollar store. Using everyday materials, such as tape, colored paper, yarn (or string), 
and markers, they identify the promoter region, TATA box, transcription start site, and 
terminal sequence. They describe the process of transcription from the initial binding of 
the transcription factors to the production of the transcript. This can be introduced or 
de-briefed using a Think-Pair-Share approach.

Construct an Argument  
Students develop a skit to demonstrate the process of translation. Once they have an 
understanding of the process, challenge them to act out what might happen if there were a 
change in the DNA sequence or if one of the needed components was unavailable. Debrief 
by having students explain the r
