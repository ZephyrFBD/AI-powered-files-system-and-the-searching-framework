) or lose (in a hypertonic solution) the greatest
amount of water (and weight) when the difference in water potentials across the membrane is greatest. When the
water potentials are equal (in an isotonic solution), there is no net movement of water, and the weight of the cell
remains unchanged. Thus, you can identify the sucrose concentrations of the various solutions by the degree to
which they result in a weight change. A graph of your data, with the solutions plotted such that they are arranged in
increasing effect on the potato weight, will reveal the solutions in order of solute concentration.
When there is no change in the weight of a potato, the surrounding sucrose solution is isotonic relative to the potato,
and the water potentials of the water and surrounding solutions are equal. The water potential (Ψ) of the sucrose
solution is the sum of its solute potential (Ψs) and pressure potential
(Ψp), but for a solution in an open beaker, the pressure potential = 0. Ψ (sucrose solut
