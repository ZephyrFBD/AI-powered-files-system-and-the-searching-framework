only about 10,000. Like taste receptors,
olfactory receptors are each responsive to only one odorant. Odorants dissolve in nasal mucosa, where they excite their
corresponding olfactory sensory cells. When these cells detect an odorant, they send their signals to the main olfactory
bulb and then to other locations in the brain, including the olfactory cortex.
27.4 Hearing and Vestibular Sensation
Audition is important for territory defense, predation, predator defense, and communal exchanges. The vestibular system,
which is not auditory, detects linear acceleration and angular acceleration and deceleration. Both the auditory system and
vestibular system use hair cells as their receptors.
Auditory stimuli are sound waves. The sound wave energy reaches the outer ear (pinna, canal, tympanum), and vibrations
of the tympanum send the energy to the middle ear. The middle ear bones shift and the stapes transfers mechanical energy
to the oval window of the fluid-filled inner ear cochlea. Once i
