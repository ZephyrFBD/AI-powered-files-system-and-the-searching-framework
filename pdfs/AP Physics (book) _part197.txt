the position vs. time graph of Fig. 2–27 for which the slope of the straight line
represents the average velocity.] The instantaneous acceleration at any time, say 
is the slope of the tangent to the 
vs.
curve at that time, which is also shown in
Fig. 2–30. Using this fact for the situation graphed in Fig. 2–30, as we go from
time 
to time 
the velocity continually increases, but the acceleration (the rate at
which the velocity changes) is decreasing since the slope of the curve is decreasing.
