roteins facilitate diffusion at a rate of tens of millions of molecules per second, whereas carrier
proteins work at a rate of a thousand to a million molecules per second.
Osmosis
Osmosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water
across the membrane, which is inversely proportional to the concentration of solutes. While diffusion transports material
across membranes and within cells, osmosis transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the diffusion
of solutes in the water. Not surprisingly, the aquaporins that facilitate water movement play a large role in osmosis, most
prominently in red blood cells and the membranes of kidney tubules.
Mechanism
Osmosis is a special case of diffusion. Water, like other substances, moves from an area of high concentration to one of low
concentration. An obvious question is what makes water move at all? Imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane
separating the two
