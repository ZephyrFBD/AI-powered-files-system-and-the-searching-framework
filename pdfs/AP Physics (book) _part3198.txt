this
consistent with the uncertainty principle in its energy form?
Explain.
11. Which model of the hydrogen atom, the Bohr model or
the quantum-mechanical model, predicts that the electron
spends more time near the nucleus? Explain.
12. The size of atoms varies by only a factor of three or so,
from largest to smallest, yet the number of electrons varies
from one to over 100. Explain.
13. Excited hydrogen and excited helium atoms both radiate
light as they jump down to the
state.
Why do the two elements have very different emission spectra?
14. How would the Periodic Table look if there were no electron
spin but otherwise quantum mechanics were valid? Consider
the first 20 elements or so.
