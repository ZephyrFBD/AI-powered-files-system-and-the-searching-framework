, BeF2 has two identical bonds and a linear geometry. We have used one of the 2p 
orbitals in making the hybrids; the remaining two 2p atomic orbitals of Be remain unhy-
bridized and are vacant. Remember also that each fluorine atom has two other valence 
p atomic orbitals, each containing one nonbonding electron pair. Those atomic orbitals 
are omitted from Figure 9.15 to keep the illustration simpler.

sp2 and sp3 Hybrid Orbitals
Whenever we mix a certain number of atomic orbitals, we get the same number of hybrid 
orbitals. Each hybrid orbital is equivalent to the others but points in a different direction. 
Thus, mixing one 2s and one 2p atomic orbital yields two equivalent sp hybrid orbitals 
that point in opposite directions (Figure 9.14). Other combinations of atomic orb
