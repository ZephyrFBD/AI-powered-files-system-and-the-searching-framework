c colloids are most like the solutions that we have previously examined. In 
the human body, the extremely large protein molecules such as enzymes and antibodies 
are kept in suspension by interaction with surrounding water molecules. A hydrophilic 
molecule folds in such a way that its hydrophobic groups are away from the water mole-
cules, on the inside of the folded molecule, while its hydrophilic, polar groups are on the 
surface, interacting with the water molecules. The hydrophilic groups generally contain 
oxygen or nitrogen and often carry a charge (Figure 13.26).
Give It Some Thought
Some proteins reside in the hydrophobic lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. Would 
hydrophilic groups of these proteins still be facing the lipid “solvent”?

Hydrophilic polar and charged groups on
a molecule’s surface help the molecule remain
dispersed in water and other polar solvents.
