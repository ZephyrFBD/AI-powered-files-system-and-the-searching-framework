has a length of approximately 1.5 meters with a volume
between 6 and 7 liters. The total volume of gut microbes is
just a few hundred milliliters.
B. Predict the length of a large intestine with equivalent
recovery of resources and the same transit times through
the bowel if, rather than 100 trillion organisms with a total
volume of 1 L, there were 100 billion (1011) organisms,
each with a volume of 10-8 mL (the approximate volume
of the epithelial cells lining the intestine).
The relationship between gut microbes and their host is
more complex than simple resource recovery, as shown in
the figure of the microbiome below. PYY is a hormone
that works with the enteric nervous system lining the
intestinal wall to cause changes in the period of
contractions of muscles (motility) that push material
through the intestine.
C. Based on the diagram, summarize the regulation of
appetite by the microbiome and the elimination of waste
by the host in terms of feedback loops and chemical
signaling.
