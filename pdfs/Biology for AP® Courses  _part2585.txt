intestines of human patients (Liu et al, Lancet Infect. Dis.,
2016). Colistin is cheap to produce, is often used as a feed
supplement for domesticated animals (12,000 metric tons
per year in 2015), and its use is increasing. Colistin is also
unstable in water (Healan et al., Antimicrob. Agents
Chemother, 2012).
B. Describe the possible biological consequences of an
immediate ban on the use of colistin in agriculture.
82. Life on Earth is sustained by four processes that are
unique to prokaryotes: 1) methanogens reduce hydrogen or
carbon atoms to produce methane; 2) methanotrophs
combine methane with oxygen to form formaldehyde; 3)
nitrogen fixation converts N2 into ammonia; and 4)
nitrification converts ammonia into nitrates. These
processes recycle matter, maintaining th
