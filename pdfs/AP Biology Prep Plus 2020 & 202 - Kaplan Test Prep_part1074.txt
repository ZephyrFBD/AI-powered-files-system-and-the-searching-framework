In a symbiotic relationship, populations may be mutualistic, parasitic, or commensal. These
relationships drive the birth and death rates, affecting the size and age of a population. In a
mutualistic relationship, both populations benefit. In a parasitic relationship, one population
benefits, while the other is harmed. In a commensal relationship, one population benefits, and
the other is not affected.  
Over the last 60 years, Species C decreased and Species B increased, suggesting Species B is a predator of
Species C.
A symbiotic relationship may be mutualistic, parasitic, or commensal, which aﬀects population size and age.
