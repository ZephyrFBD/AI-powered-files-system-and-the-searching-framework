Early Experiments
Experiments during the first half of the twentieth century lead to the identification of DNA as the hereditary material
and that the threedimensional shape of a DNA molecule is a double helix. Four important research efforts are
summarized here:
1. Griffith discovers that genetic information can be transferred from dead bacteria to living bacteria.
Microbiologist Frederick Griffith experimented with two strains of a bacteriumâ€”one that produces a polysaccharide
coat and causes pneumonia, and a mutant strain, without the coat, that does not cause pneumonia. Griffith killed the
diseasecausing bacteria with heat and showed that they could no longer cause pneumonia in mice. He then injected
into mice both the dead bacteria, that once could cause disease, and live bacteria that could not cause disease. These
mice died, and Griffith found live bacteria in the mice that had polysaccharide coats. The descendants of these
bacteria also had polysaccharide coats and would cause
