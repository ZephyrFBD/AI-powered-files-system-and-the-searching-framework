B
Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes possess double-stranded DNA. Choices (A), (C), and (D) are correct
differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

C
Bb and Bb is the correct set of genotypes that represents a cross that could produce offspring with silver
fur from parents that both have brown fur. Complete a Punnett square for this question. In order for the
offspring to have silver fur, both parents must have the silver allele.

A
Retroviruses have an RNA genome (hereditary material, eliminating (B)) that must be reverse-transcribed
into DNA (which is the opposite of the Central Dogma first step) and therefore (A) is correct. The codon
sequence is used by all things that do translation (like viruses, eliminating (C)). Retroviruses use
transcription as well after their genome has been reverse transcribed, so (D) is also incorrect.

D
All of the choices are examples of hydrolysis except the conversion of pyruvic acid to glucose.
Hydrolysis is the breaking of a covalent bon
