 12.9  Shown here are cartoons of two different polymers. Which 
of these polymers would you expect to be more crystal-
line? Which one would have the higher melting point?

 12.10  The accompanying image shows photoluminescence from 
four different samples of CdTe nanocrystals, each embedded 
in a polymer matrix. The photoluminescence occurs be-
cause the samples are being irradiated by a UV light source. 
The nanocrystals in each vial have different average sizes. 
The sizes are 4.0, 3.5, 3.2, and 2.8 nm. (a) Which vial con-
tains the 4.0-nm nanocrystals? (b) Which vial contains the 
2.8-nm nanocrystals? (c) Crystals of CdTe that have sizes 
that are larger than approximately 100 nm have a band gap 
of 1.5 eV. What would be the wavelength and frequency of 
light emitted from these crystals? What type of light is
