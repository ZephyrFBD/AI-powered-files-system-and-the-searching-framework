Modeling
The study of the changes in ecosystem structure caused by changes in the environment (disturbances) or by internal forces
is called ecosystem dynamics. Ecosystems are characterized using a variety of research methodologies. Some ecologists
study ecosystems using controlled experimental systems, while some study entire ecosystems in their natural state, and
