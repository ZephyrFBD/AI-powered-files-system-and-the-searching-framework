 10.44  Many gases are shipped in high-pressure containers. Con-
sider a steel tank whose volume is 55.0 gallons that contains 
O2 gas at a pressure of 16,500 kPa at 23 째C. (a) What mass of 
O2 does the tank contain? (b) What volume would the gas 
occupy at STP? (c) At what temperature would the pressure 
in the tank equal 150.0 atm? (d) What would be the pressure 
of the gas, in kPa, if it were transferred to a container at 24 째C 
whose volume is 55.0 L?
 10.45 In an experiment reported in the scientific literature, male 
cockroaches were made to run at different speeds on a minia-
ture treadmill while their oxygen consumption was measured. 
In 1 hr the average cockroach running at 0.08 km>hr con-
sumed 0.8 mL of O2 at 1 atm pressure and 24 째C per gram of 
insect mass. (a) How many moles of O2 would be consumed in 
1 hr by a 5.2-g cockroach moving at this speed?  (b) This same 
cockroach is caught by a child and placed in a 1-qt fruit jar 
with a tight lid.
