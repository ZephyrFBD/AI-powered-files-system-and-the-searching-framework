d. There are two types of receptors, internal
receptors and cell-surface receptors.
Internal receptors
Internal receptors, also known as intracellular or cytoplasmic receptors, are found in the cytoplasm of the cell and respond
to hydrophobic ligand molecules that are able to travel across the plasma membrane. Once inside the cell, many of these
molecules bind to proteins that act as regulators of mRNA synthesis (transcription) to mediate gene expression. Gene
expression is the cellular process of transforming the information in a cell's DNA into a sequence of amino acids, which
ultimately forms a protein. When the ligand binds to the internal receptor, a conformational change is triggered that exposes
a DNA-binding site on the protein. The ligand-receptor complex moves into the nucleus, then binds to specific regulatory
regions of the chromosomal DNA and promotes the initiation of transcription (Figure 9.4). Transcription is the process
of copying the information in a cells DNA into a
