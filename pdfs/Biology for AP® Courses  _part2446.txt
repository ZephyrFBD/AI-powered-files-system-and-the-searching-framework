 worked primarily with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium that
causes tuberculosis and developed postulates to identify disease-causing organisms that continue to be widely used in the
medical community. Kochâ€™s postulates include that an organism can be identified as the cause of disease when it is present in
all infected samples and absent in all healthy samples, and it is able to reproduce the infection after being cultured multiple
times. Today, cultures remain a primary diagnostic tool in medicine and other areas of molecular biology.
Figure 22.7 In these agar plates, the growth medium is supplemented with red blood cells. Blood agar becomes
transparent in the presence of hemolytic Streptococcus, which destroys red blood cells and is used to diagnose
Streptococcus infections. The plate on the left is inoculated with non-hemolytic Staphylococcus (large white colonies),
and the plate on the right is inoculated with hemolytic Streptococcus (tiny clear colonies). If you look clos
