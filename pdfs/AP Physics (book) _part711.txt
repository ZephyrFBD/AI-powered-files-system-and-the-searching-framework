7–4 Conservation of Energy and
Momentum in Collisions
During most collisions, we usually don’t know how the collision force varies 
over time, and so analysis using Newton’s second law becomes difficult or impos-
sible. But by making use of the conservation laws for momentum and energy,
we can still determine a lot about the motion after a collision, given the motion
before the collision. We saw in Section 7–2 that in the collision of two objects
such as billiard balls, the total momentum is conserved. If the two objects are
very hard and no heat or oth
