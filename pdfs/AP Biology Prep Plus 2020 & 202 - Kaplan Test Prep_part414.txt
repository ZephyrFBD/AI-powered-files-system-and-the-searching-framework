Photosynthesis Investigation
In this investigation, you will learn how to measure the rate of
photosynthesis by determining oxygen production. To review,
photosynthesis is the process by which autotrophs capture free energy
(in the form of sunlight) to build carbohydrates. The process is
summarized by the following reaction:
2 H2O + CO2 + light → carbohydrate (CH2O) + O2 + H2O
To determine the rate of photosynthesis by a plant cell, you can measure
the production of O2 or the consumption of CO2. The process is not that
simple, though, because photosynthesis is coupled with aerobic
respiration, in which the oxygen produced is simultaneously
