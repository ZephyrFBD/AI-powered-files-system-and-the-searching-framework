n terrestrial 
systems, plants play the role of producers. Plants allocate that biomass (energy) to power 
their life processes or to store energy. Different plants have different strategies of energy 
allocation that reflect their role in various ecosystems. For example, annual weedy 
plants allocate a larger percentage of their biomass production to reproductive processes 
and seeds than do slower growing perennials. As plants, the producers are consumed 
or decomposed, and their stored chemical energy powers additional individuals, the 
consumers, or trophic levels of the biotic community. Biotic systems run on energy 
much as economic systems run on money. Energy is generally in limited supply in most 
communities. Energy dynamics in a biotic community is fundamental to understanding 
ecological interactions. 
To model ecosystem energy dynamics, you will estimate the net primary productivity
