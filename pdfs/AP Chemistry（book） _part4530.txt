HE HALIDE PEROVSKITES, 
exempliﬁed by methylammonium 
lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3), whose 
structure is shown here and on the front 
cover, have emerged in recent years as 
alternatives to conventional semiconductors 
like silicon, gallium arsenide, and cadmium selenide. These materials show 
tremendous potential for use in devices such as light-emitting diodes and radiation 
detectors, but no application has generated more excitement than their performance 
in solar cells. Scientists have been able to prepare halide perovskite-based solar cells 
that convert sunlight to electricity with 20% efﬁciency, a ﬁgure comparable to the 
best silicon solar cells on the market. While the high efﬁciencies are impressive, the 
truly revolutionary breakthrough is that halide perovskite solar cells can be made from 
solution using inexpensive, readily available laboratory equipment, whereas fab
