 the eukaryotic cell walls found in plants (cellulose) or fungi and insects (chitin). The cell
wall functions as a protective layer, and it is responsible for the organismâ€™s shape. Some bacteria have an outer capsule
outside the cell wall. Other structures are present in some prokaryotic species, but not in others (Table 22.2). For example,
the capsule found in some species enables the organism to attach to surfaces, protects it from dehydration and attack by
phagocytic cells, and makes pathogens more resistant to our immune responses. Some species also have flagella (singular,
flagellum) used for locomotion, and pili (singular, pilus) used for attachment to surfaces. Plasmids, which consist of extra-
chromosomal DNA, are also present in many species of bacteria and archaea.
Characteristics of phyla of Bacteria are described in Figure 22.12 and Figure 22.13; Archaea are described in Figure 22.14.
