 magnet).
Magnetic field lines continue inside a magnet, as indicated in Fig. 20–4b.
Indeed, given the lack of single magnetic poles, magnetic field lines always form
closed loops, unlike electric field lines that begin on positive charges and end on
negative charges.

FIGURE 20–3 If you split a magnet,
you won’t get isolated north and
south poles; instead, two new
magnets are produced, each with a
north and a south pole.
FIGURE 20–2 Like poles of two
magnets repel; unlike poles attract.

FIGURE 20–4 (a) Visualizing
magnetic field lines around a bar
magnet, using iron filings and
compass needles. The red end of the
bar magnet is its north pole. The
N pole of a nearby compass needle
points away from the north pole of
the magnet. (b) Diagram of
magnetic field lines for a bar magnet.
