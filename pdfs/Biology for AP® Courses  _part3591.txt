of the lung over a specific period,
usually one second (FEV1). In addition, the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the total amount of air that can be forcibly
exhaled, is measured. The ratio of these values (FEV1/FVC ratio) is used to diagnose lung diseases including asthma,
emphysema, and fibrosis. If the FEV1/FVC ratio is high, the lungs are not compliant (meaning they are stiff and unable
to bend properly), and the patient most likely has lung fibrosis. Patients exhale most of the lung volume very quickly.
Conversely, when the FEV1/FVC ratio is low, there is resistance in the lung that is characteristic of asthma. In this instance,
it is hard for the patient to get the air out of his or her lungs, and it takes a long time to reach the maximal exhalation volume.
In either case, breathing is difficult and complications arise.
