3 does work on the ball. Water does
work on turbine blades. A bow does work on an arrow. This observation gives us
a further insight into the relation between work and energy: work is done when
energy is transferred from one object to another.†

†If the objects are at different temperatures, heat can flow between them instead, or in addition. See
Chapters 14 and 15.
FIGURE 6–24 Gravitational
potential energy of water at the top
of Yosemite Falls gets transformed
into kinetic energy as the water 
falls. (Some of the energy is 
transformed into heat by air 
resistance, and some into sound.)

bent bow about to be transformed
into kinetic energy of an arrow.

Quicker Solution
Alternate Solution Instead of dividing the solution into two parts, we can do it
all at once. After all, we get to choose what two points are used on the left
