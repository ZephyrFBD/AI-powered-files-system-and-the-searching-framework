ease as we move down in a given 
group in the periodic table because of the increasing principal 
quantum number of the outer-shell electrons. 
 (Section 7.3) 
However, Figure 23.2 shows that once we move beyond the group 
3B elements, the period 5 and period 6 transition elements in a 
given group have virtually the same radii. In group 5B, for example, 
*Note that the radii defined in this way, often referred to as metallic radii, 
differ somewhat from the bonding atomic radii defined in Section 7.3.

tantalum in period 6 has virtually the same radius as niobium in period 5. This interesting 
and important effect has its origin in the lanthanide series, elements 57 through 70. The fill-
ing of 4f orbitals through the lanthanide elements 
 (Figure 6.31) causes a steady increase 
in the effective nuclear charge, producing a size decrease, called the lanthanide contrac-
tion, that just offsets the increase we expect as we go fr
