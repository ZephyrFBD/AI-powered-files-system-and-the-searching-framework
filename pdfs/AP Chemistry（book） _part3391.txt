nvolving radioactive decay for which 14CO2 would 
behave differently from 12CO2?
Radiotracers have found wide use as diagnostic tools in medicine. 
Table 21.6 lists some radiotracers and their uses. These radioiso-
topes are incorporated into a compound that is administered to 
the patient, usually intravenously. The diagnostic use of these 
isotopes is based on the ability of the radioactive compound to 
localize and concentrate in the organ or tissue under investiga-
tion. Iodine-131, for example, has been used to test the activity of 
the thyroid gland. This gland is the only place in which iodine is 
incorporated significantly in the body. The patient drinks a solu-
tion of NaI containing iodine-131. Only a very small amount is 
used so that the patient does not receive a harmful dose of radio-
activity. A Geiger counter placed close to the thyroid, in the neck 
region, determines the ability of the thyroid to take up the iodine. 
A normal thyroid will absorb about 12% of the iodin
