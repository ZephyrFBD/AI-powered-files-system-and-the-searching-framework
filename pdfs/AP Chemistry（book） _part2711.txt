Several aspects of these equilibria are notable. First, although 
carbonic acid is diprotic, the carbonate ion 1CO3
2 -2 is unimportant 
in this system. Second, one component of this equilibrium, CO2, is a 
gas, which provides a mechanism for the body to adjust the equilib-
ria. Removal of CO2 via exhalation shifts the equilibria to the right, 
consuming H+ ions. Third, the buffer system in blood operates at 
pH 7.4, which is fairly far removed from the pKa1 value of H2CO3 
(6.1 at physiological temperatures). For the buffer to have a pH of 
7.4, the ratio [base]/[acid] must be about 20. In normal blood plas-
ma, the concentrations of HCO3
- and H2CO3 are about 0.024 M and 
0.0012 M, respectively. Consequently, the buffer has a high capacity 
to neutralize additional acid but only a low capacity to neutralize 
additional base.
The principal organs that regulate the pH of the carbonic acid–
bicarbonate buffer system are the lungs and kidneys. When the con
