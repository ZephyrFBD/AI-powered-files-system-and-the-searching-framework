l 95 of those 100 times. In other words, you would
expect your mean to fall within the 95% confidence interval 95% of the time, but 5% of the time you would expect
the mean to be outside of the 95% confidence interval.
To construct a 95% confidence interval, you need to know the upper limit of the interval and the lower limit of
the interval. The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is found by starting with the mean and then adding two
times the standard error of the mean:
To find the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval, start with the mean and then subtract two times the standard
error of the mean:
Here’s an example to practice working with 95% confidence intervals.
An AP Biology class grows “Fast Plants” (Brassica rapa) and records the height of each plant on day 28 of
growth. The mean plant height and standard error of the mean are calculated. The 10 tallest plants are cross-
pollinated and produce seeds. These seeds are harvested and planted to form a second generatio
