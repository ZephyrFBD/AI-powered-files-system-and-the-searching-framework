 alkane. There are 18 isomers with the molecular formula C8H18, for 
example, and 75 with the molecular formula C10H22.
Give It Some Thought
What evidence can you cite to support the fact that although isomers have the 
same molecular formula they are in fact different compounds?
Nomenclature of Alkanes
In the first column of Table 24.3, the names in parentheses are called the common 
names. The common name of the isomer with no branches begins with the letter n
