ing new transcripts for antibody proteins, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because
Golgi bodies modify proteins, not RNA transcripts.
10. (C) rRNA catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds during translation. Choice (A) is incorrect because RNA
polymerase performs transcription, not translation. mRNA brings the genetic information from the nucleus to
the ribosome but does not catalyze the formation of peptide bonds, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (D) is
incorrect because tRNA serves as an “adapter” molecule that brings the amino acids that correspond to each
codon to the ribosome.

11. (a) The splicing of exons occurs in the nucleus.
(b) The codons in exons are expressed in the protein and code for amino acids in the protein. Introns are
noncoding sequences and do not code for amino acids in the protein.
(c) The EDS mutation would result in a shorter, less functional procollagen protein.
(d) If an exon was deleted, the resulting mRNA transcript
