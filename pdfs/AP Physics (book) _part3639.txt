eziano in 1968: Each fundamental particle (Table 32–5) is imagined not as a
point but as a one-dimensional string, perhaps 
long, which vibrates in a
particular standing wave pattern. (You might say each particle is a different note
on a tiny stretched string.) More sophisticated theories propose the fundamental
entities as being multidimensional branes (after 2-D membranes).
A related idea that also goes way beyond the Standard Model is supersymmetry,
which applied to strings is known as superstring theory. Supersymmetry,
developed by Bruno Zumino (1923– ) and Julius Wess (1934–2007), predicts that
interactions exist that would change fermions into bosons and vice versa, and
that each known fermion would have a supersymmetric boson partner. Thus, for
each quark (a fermion), there would be a squark (a boson) or “supersymmetric”
quark. For every lepton there would be a slepton. Likewise, for every known
boson (photons and gluons, for example), there would be a supersymmetric
fermion (ph
