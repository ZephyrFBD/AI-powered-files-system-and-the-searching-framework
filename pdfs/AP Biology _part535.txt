. In the summer of 2007, Arctic sea ice covered the
smallest area on record. Melting ice and the resulting decrease in habitat
endanger Arctic animals such as polar bears, seals, and seabirds. Higher
temperatures also increase the likelihood of fires, which destroy even more
animal habitats. Melting polar ice causes the seas to rise, resulting in more
coastal and inland flooding, flash floods, and erosion.

The only solution to global warming is to reduce CO2 emissions by
industrialized nations and to reduce deforestation, particularly in the
tropics. Forests absorb CO2 from the atmosphere as they grow. They also
store carbon in their wood, leaves, and soil. Forests release the CO2 when
they are cut down. Deforestation accounts for about 12% of greenhouse
gas emissions. One possible solution to the problem of deforestation would
be to pay countries not to cut down their forests. This would slow global
warming as well as preserve biodiversity.
