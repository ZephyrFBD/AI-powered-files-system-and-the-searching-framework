s, let’s look at a cross of two traits using
those four gametes that we created above. A dihybrid cross is just like the monohybrid, but it studies how two
genes are passed on to offspring.
Here is the Punnett Square for a cross between two double heterozygotes (Tt Gg).
This is an example of the Law of Independent Assortment. Each of the traits segregated independently. Don’t worry
about the different combinations in the cross—you’ll make yourself dizzy with all those letters. Simply memorize
the phenotype ratio of the pea plants. For the 16 offspring there are:
9 tall and green
3 tall and yellow
3 short and green
1 short and yellow
That’s 9:3:3:1, but don’t forget the circumstances to which this applies. It is only when two heterozygotes for two
genes are crossed. It is not just a magic ratio that always works.
Rules of Probability
The Punnett square method works well for monohybrid crosses and helps us visualize possible combinations.
However, a better method for predicting the likel
