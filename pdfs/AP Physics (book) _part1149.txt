1–2 Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion
With forces that are not constant, such as here with simple harmonic motion, it is
often convenient and useful to use the energy approach, as we saw in Chapter 6.
To stretch or compress a spring, work has to be done. Hence potential
energy is stored in a stretched or compressed spring. We have already seen in
Section 6–4 that elastic potential energy is given by
The total mechanical energy E is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies,
(11;3)
where v is the speed of the mass m at a distance x from the equilibrium position.

SHM can occur only if friction is negligible so that the total mechanical energy E
remains constant. As the mass oscillates back and forth, the energy continuously
changes from potential energy to kinetic energy, and back again (Fig. 11–5). At
the extreme points,
