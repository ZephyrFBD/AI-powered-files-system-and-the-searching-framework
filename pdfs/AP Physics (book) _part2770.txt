 to
avoid underexposure (too little light so the picture is dark and only the brightest
objects show up) or overexposure (too much light, so that bright objects have a
lack of contrast and “washed-out” appearance). A high quality camera con-
trols the exposure with a “stop” or iris diaphragm, whose opening is of variable
diameter, placed behind the lens (Fig. 25–1). The lens opening is controlled
(automatically or manually) to compensate for bright or dark lighting conditions,
the sensitivity of the sensor or film,† and for different shutter speeds. The size of
the opening is specified by the f-stop or f-number, defined as
where f is the focal length of the lens and D is the diameter of the lens opening
(see Fig. 25–1). For example, when a 50-mm-focal-length lens has an opening

For faster shutter
speeds, or low light conditions, a wider lens opening must be used to get a proper
exposure, which corresponds
