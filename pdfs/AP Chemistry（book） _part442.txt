▲ Figure 3.12 Procedure for interconverting mass and number of formula units. The number of moles  
of the substance is central to the calculation. Thus, the mole concept can be thought of as the bridge  
between the mass of a sample in grams and the number of formula units contained in the sample.

What units would you put under “molar mass” and “Avogadro’s number” 
on this diagram?
We have rounded our answer to one significant figure because we used only one signif-
icant figure for the mass of the penny. Notice how dimensional analysis provides a straight-
forward route from grams to numbers of atoms. The molar mass and Avogadro’s number are 
used as conversion factors to convert grams to moles and then moles to atoms. Notice also 
that our answer is a very large number. Any time you calculate the number of atoms, mole-
cules, or ions in
