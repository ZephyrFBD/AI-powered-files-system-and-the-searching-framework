o terrestrial environments. Xylem and phloem transport water, minerals, and sugars produced through
photosynthesis through the plant body (see the Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants module). In addition all plant
species respond to environmental factors, such as light, gravity, competition, temperature, and predation (see the Plant
Sensory Systems and Reponses module). Like animals, plants contain cells with organelles, in which specific metabolic
activities occur, and specialized tissues and organs. Unlike animals, plant use energy from sunlight to synthesize sugars
during photosynthesis—creating the food that supports life on this planet. Without plants, life on Earth could not exist.
With the exception of vascular tissue—which we will explore in detail in the Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants
module—information presented in this section, and the examples highlighted, does not align to the content and AP®
Learning Objectives outlined in the AP® Curriculum Framework.
