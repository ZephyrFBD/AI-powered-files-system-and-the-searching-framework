adation of p35 results in increased 
synaptic activity. 
(C) Reabsorption of p35 from the synaptic cleft 
results in increased synaptic activity. 
(D) Attachment of p35 to synaptic vesicles results 
in increased synaptic activity. 
48. Based on the model, which of the following
best explains how regulation of neurotransmitter
release might increase the range of responses to
a stimulus in the nervous system?
(A) In the absence of any stimulus, neurons
can still release neurotransmitters.  
(B) Different neurons in the same neural 
network can release different amounts of 
neurotransmitter. 
(C) In the depolarization phase of an action 
potential, postsynaptic neurons can adjust 
the amount of neurotransmitter bound to 
receptors on their surface. 
(D) In the recovery phase following a stimulus, 
enzymes can be mobilized to degrade 
molecules present in the synaptic vesicles.
