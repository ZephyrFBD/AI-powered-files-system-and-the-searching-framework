n a leaf) to intercellular air
spaces and then out the stomata. This occurs because the water potential is highest in the mesophyll cells and lowest
in the relatively dry air outside the leaf. Evaporation of water from plant surfaces is called transpiration.
4. Adhesion-cohesion-tension. Because water is a polar molecule, it forms weak hydrogen bonds with other water
molecules and other polar molecules. As water moves up through a plant to the leaves, the adhesion (attraction of
unlike molecules) of water molecules to cells walls opposes the downward pull of gravity. Also, cohesion (attraction
of like molecules) between water molecules makes water act as a continuous polymer from root to leaf. As
transpiration removes molecules of water from the leaves, water molecules are pulled up from the roots. The
transpirational pull of water through the xylem decreases the pressure potential in the xylem, resulting in negative
water potential, or tension. The cohesion-tension condition produced
