A: (e).
B: (a) Counterclockwise; (b) clockwise; (c) zero;
(d) counterclockwise.
C: Clockwise (conventional current counterclockwise).
D: (a) Increase (brighter); (b) yes; resists more (counter
torque).
E: 10 turns.
F: From Eq. 21–11b, the higher the frequency the lower the
reactance, so in (a) more high frequency current flows to
circuit B. In (b) higher frequencies pass to ground whereas
lower frequencies pass more easily to circuit B.

6. A ballistic galvanometer is a device that measures the total
charge Q that passes through it in a short time. It is con-
nected to a search coil that measures B (also called a flip coil)
which is a small coil with N turns, each of cross-sectional
area A. The flip coil is placed in the magnetic field to be
measured with its face perpendicular to the field. It is then
quickly rotated 180° about a diameter. Show that the total
charge Q
