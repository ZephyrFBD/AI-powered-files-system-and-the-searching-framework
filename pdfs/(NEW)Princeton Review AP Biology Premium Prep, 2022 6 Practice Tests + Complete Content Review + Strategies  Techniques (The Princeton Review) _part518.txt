 must vary by six orders of ten (106), or 1,000,000-
fold. Since lower pH values have more hydrogen ions, they are also more acidic.

C
All amino acids share a carboxylic acid group, COOH, labeled (B), and an amino-group, NH2, labeled
(D). They also share a hydrogen atom bound to the central carbon, (A). Differences in amino acids are
defined by variations in the fourth position called the R-group, labeled (C).

B
The hypothesis that life may have arisen from formation of complex molecules from the primordial
“soup” of Earth is not supported by the absence of nucleic acids. All life is DNA-based, yet no nucleic
acid molecules were detected. The presence of carbon molecules, amino acids, and sugars, which are
common compounds and compose life, supports the hypothesis, so eliminate (A), (C), and (D). Choice
(B) is correct.
5.
C
The amino acids cysteine and methionine contain the element sulfur (as indicated by the S in the amino
acid structure shown). However, no sulfur-based compoun
