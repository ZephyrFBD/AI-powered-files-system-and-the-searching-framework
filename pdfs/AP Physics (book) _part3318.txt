 be made to jump from the valence to the conduction
band by the passage of an 830-keV photon that loses all its
energy in this fashion?
22. (III) We saw that there are 2N possible electron states in
the 3s band of Na, where N is the total number of atoms.
How many possible electron states are there in the (a) 2s
band, (b) 2p band, and (c) 3p band? (d) State a general
formula for the total number of possible states in any given
electron band.

23. (III) Suppose that a silicon semiconductor is doped with
phosphorus so that one silicon atom in 
is
replaced by a phosphorus atom. Assuming that the “extra”
electron in every phosphorus atom is donated to the con-
duction band, by what factor is the density of conduction
electrons increased? The density of silicon is 
and the density of conduction electrons in pure silicon is
about 
at room temperature.
