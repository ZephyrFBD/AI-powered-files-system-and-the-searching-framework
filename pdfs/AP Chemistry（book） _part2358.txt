[14.125] As shown in Figure 14.23, the ﬁrst step in the heteroge-
neous hydrogenation of ethylene is adsorption of the 
ethylene molecule on a metal surface. One proposed

 14.120  The gas-phase reaction of NO with F2 to form NOF and F 
has an activation energy of Ea = 6.3 kJ>mol. and a fre-
quency factor of A = 6.0 * 108 M -1 s-1. The reaction is 
believed to be bimolecular:
NO1g2 + F21g2 ¡  NOF1g2 + F1g2
 
 (a) Calculate the rate constant at 100 °C. (b) Draw the 
Lewis structures for the NO and the NOF molecules, giv-
en that the chemical formula for NOF is misleading be-
cause the nitrogen atom is actually the central atom in 
the molecule. (c) Predict the shape for the NOF molecule. 
(d) Draw a possible transition state for the formation of 
NOF, using dashed lines to indicate the weak bonds that 
are beginning to form. (e) Suggest a reason for the low ac-
tivation energy for
