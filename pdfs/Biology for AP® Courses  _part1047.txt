tein synthesis in the nucleus to begin.
(See Figure 9.10 for the phosphorylation pathway that activates ERK.)
The second kind of protein with which PKC can interact is a protein that acts as an inhibitor. An inhibitor is a molecule
that binds to a protein and prevents it from functioning or reduces its function. In this case, the inhibitor is a protein called
Iκ-B, which binds to the regulatory protein NF-κB. (The symbol κ represents the Greek letter kappa.) When Iκ-B is bound
to NF-κB, the complex cannot enter the nucleus of the cell, but when Iκ-B is phosphorylated by PKC, it can no longer bind
NF-κB, and NF-κB (a transcription factor) can enter the nucleus and initiate RNA transcription. In this case, the effect of
phosphorylation is to inactivate an inhibitor and thereby activate the process of transcription.

The result of another signaling pathway affects muscle cells. The activation of β-adrenergic receptors in muscle cells by
adrenaline leads to a
