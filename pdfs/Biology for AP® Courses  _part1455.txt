and the duplicated region inverted and reinserted on chromosome 18 of an ancestral human.
A comparison of human and chimpanzee genes in the region of this inversion indicates that two
genes—ROCK1 and USP14—that are adjacent on chimpanzee chromosome 17 (which corresponds to
human chromosome 18) are more distantly positioned on human chromosome 18. This suggests that one
of the inversion breakpoints occurred between these two genes. Interestingly, humans and chimpanzees
express USP14 at distinct levels in specific cell types, including cortical cells and fibroblasts. Perhaps the
chromosome 18 inversion in an ancestral human repositioned specific genes and reset their expression
levels in a useful way. Because both ROCK1 and USP14 encode cellular enzymes, a change in their
expression could alter cellular function. It is not known how this inversion contributed to hominid evolution,
but it appears to be a significant factor in the divergence of humans from other primates.
