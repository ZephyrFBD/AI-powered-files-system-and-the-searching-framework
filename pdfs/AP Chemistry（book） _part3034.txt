molecules least able to have 
rotational motion?
Rigid, crystalline structure
Motion restricted to vibration only
Smallest number of microstates
Ice
Increased freedom with respect
to translation
Free to vibrate and rotate
Larger number of microstates
Liquid water
Increasing entropy
Molecules spread out, essentially
independent of one another
Complete freedom for translation,
vibration, and rotation
Largest number of microstates
Water vapor
▲ Figure 19.9 Entropy and the phases of water. The larger the number of possible microstates,  
the higher the entropy of the system.

full range of translational, vibrational, and rotational motions. Thus, water vapor has 
an even greater number of possible microstates and therefore a higher entropy than 
liquid water or ice.
When an ionic solid dissolves in water, a mixture of water and ions replaces the 
pure so
