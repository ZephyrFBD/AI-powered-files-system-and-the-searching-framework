e solution and its molarity:
Analyze We are asked to calculate the pH at two points in the titra-
tion of a strong acid with a strong base. The first point is just before 
the equivalence point, so we expect the pH to be determined by the 
small amount of strong acid that has not yet been neutralized. The 
second point is just after the equivalence point, so we expect this 
pH to be determined by the small amount of excess strong base.
Plan (a) As the NaOH solution is added to the HCl solution, 
H+1aq2 reacts with OH-1aq2 to form H2O. Both Na+ and Cl- are 
spectator ions, having negligible effect on the pH. To determine 
the pH of the solution, we must first determine how many moles 
of H+ were originally present and how many moles of OH- were 
added. We can then calculate how many moles of each ion remain 
after the neutralization reaction. To calculate 3H+4, and hence pH, 
we must also remember that the volume of the solution increases 
as we add titrant, thus diluting the concentrat
