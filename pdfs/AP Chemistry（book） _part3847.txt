CHAPTER 24 The Chemistry of Life: Organic and Biological Chemistry
The simplest alcohol, methanol (methyl alcohol), has many industrial uses and is 
produced on a large scale by heating carbon monoxide and hydrogen under pressure in 
the presence of a metal oxide catalyst:
 
CO1g2 + 2 H21g2
¡
200 - 300 atm
400 °C
 
CH3OH1g2 
[24.14]
Because methanol has a very high octane rating as an automobile fuel, it is used as a gaso-
line additive and as a fuel in its own right.
Ethanol (ethyl alcohol, C2H5OH) is a product of the fermentation of carbohydrates 
such as sugars and starches. In the absence of air, yeast cells convert these carbohydrates 
into ethanol and CO2:
 
C6H12O61aq2 ¡
yeast  2 C2H5OH1aq2 + 2 CO21g2 
[24.15]
In the process, the yeast cells derive energy necessary for grow
