 have to use it twice.
SOLUTION Because
then
So
NOTE As a rule of thumb, an area given in 
is roughly 10 times the number
of square meters (more precisely, about 
).

Speeds. Where the posted speed limit is 55 miles per hour
(
or mph), what is this speed (a) in meters per second 
and (b) in 
kilometers per hour 
APPROACH We again use the conversion factor
and we
recall that there are 5280 ft in a mile and 12 inches in a foot; also, one hour
contains
SOLUTION (a) We can write 1 mile as
We also know that 1 hour contains 3600 s, so
where we rounded off to two significant figures.
(b) Now we use
then
NOTE Each conversion factor is equal to one. You ca
