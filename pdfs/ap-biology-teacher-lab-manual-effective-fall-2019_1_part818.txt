CONSTRUCTING LINE GRAPHS* 
Suppose we are studying some chemical reaction in which a substance, A, is being used 
up. We begin with a large quantity (100 mg) of A, and we measure in some way how 
much A is left after different times. The results of such an experiment might be presented 
pictorially like this: 
100 mg A 
80 mg A 
60 mg A 
40 mg A
