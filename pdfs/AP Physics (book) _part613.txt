ng on the rock. We choose the ground as our 
reference level
SOLUTION At the moment of release (point 1) the rock’s position is
and it is at rest:
We want to find 
when the rock is at posi-
tion  
Equation 6–13 gives
The m’s cancel out and 
, so
Solving for 
we find
The rock’s velocity 1.0 m above the ground is 
downward.
NOTE The velocity of the rock is independent of the rock’s mass.

To say it another way, consider Eq. 6–11a which tells us
that is,
if the kinetic energy KE of a system increases, then the potential energy PE must
decrease by an equivalent amount to compensate. Thus, the total,
remains constant:
If only conservative forces do work, the total mechanical energy of a system
neither increases nor decreases in any process. It stays constant—it is conserved.
This is
