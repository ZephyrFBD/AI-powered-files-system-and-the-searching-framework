. 18–5.
SOLUTION The circuit in Fig. 18–20 draws the following currents: the light-
bulb draws 
the heater draws 
the power amplifier draws a maximum of
and
the hair dryer draws
The total current drawn, if all
devices are used at the same time, is
NOTE The heater draws as much current as 18 100-W lightbulbs. For safety, the
heater should probably be on a circuit by itself.
0.8 A + 15.0 A + 1.5 A + 12.5 A = 29.8 A.
1500 W120 V = 12.5 A.
175 W120 V = 1.5 A;
15.0 A;
1800 W120 V =
I = PV = 100 W120 V = 0.8 A;
I = PV,
EXAMPLE 18;11
A dangerous extension cord. Your
1800-W portable electric heater is too far from your desk to warm your feet. Its 
cord is too short, so you plug it into an extension cord rated at 11 A. Why is this
dangerous?
RESPONSE 1800 W at 120 V draws a 15-A current. The wires in the extension
cord rated at 11 A could become hot enough to melt the insulation and cause a fire.
