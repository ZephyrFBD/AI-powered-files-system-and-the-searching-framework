seen in the cosmic microwave background
(WMAP, Fig. 33–26). That would be very nice, because the density variations we
see in the CMB are what we believe were the seeds that later coalesced under
gravity into galaxies and galaxy clusters, and our models fit the data extremely well.
Sometimes it is said that the quantum fluctuations occurred in the vacuum
state or vacuum energy. This could be possible because the vacuum is no longer
considered to be empty, as we discussed in Section 32–3 relative to positrons as holes
in a negative energy sea of electrons. Indeed, the vacuum is thought to be filled
with fields and particles occupying all the possible negative energy states.
