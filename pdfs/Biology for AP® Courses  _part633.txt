 This leads to increased electrolyte
concentration in the mucus and movement of
water into the cells. The mucus becomes
dehydrated as in CF.
d.
Arsenic poisoning disrupts the binding sites for
Cl−
ions, leading to decreased transport of
Cl−
ions outside the epithelial cells. This leads
to decreased electrolyte concentration in the
mucus and movement of water outside the cells.
The mucus becomes hydrated as in CF.

The sodium-potassium (Na+ / K+ ) pump functions like
an anti-porter transporting Na+
and K+
across
membranes using ATP. This protein spans the membrane
with intracellular and extracellular domains. It has a
binding site for Na+ , K+ , and ATP. An experiment was
conducted to determine the locations of these binding
sites. Artificial cells were created and incubated in buff
