criptive statistics and graphs to summarize large datasets, present
patterns in data, and communicate results. Descriptive statistics summarize and show variation in the data. There are
many types of descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency (such as mean, median, and mode) and
measures of variability (such as standard deviation, standard error, and range). The AP Biology Equations and
Formulas sheet contains definitions for mean, median, mode, and range. It also includes equations for mean,
standard deviation, and standard error. That said, you will not need to calculate standard deviation or standard error.
Instead, focus on understanding how these values are used.
Descriptive statistics are used to summarize the data collected from samples, but may also describe the entire
population youâ€™re trying to study. Experiments are designed to include a sample, which is a subset of the
population being studied. The best experiments use random sampling, which makes sure t
