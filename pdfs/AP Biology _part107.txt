elial cells on the surface of the
skin, which have been exposed to extensive solar radiation. Skin
cells normally die by apoptosis and are replaced every few days.
In plant cells, apoptosis is an important defense against infection
by fungus and bacterium. By dying, cells at the site of infection
leave no living tissue to spread infection inside the plant.
In mammals, including humans, several different pathways
involving enzymes called caspases carry out apoptosis. Signals
from different sources—inside or outside the cell—trigger the
apoptosis pathway. The trigger can be from a neighboring cell,
which makes use of a signal transduction pathway to begin the
process. A signal may instead come from inside the cell itself, from
irreparably damaged DNA in the nucleus, or from the endoplasmic
reticulum when excessive protein misfolding has occurred.
