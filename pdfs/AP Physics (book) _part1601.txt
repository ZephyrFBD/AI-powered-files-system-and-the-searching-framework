ts validity rests on experiments (such as Joule’s) to
which no exceptions have been seen. Since Q and W represent energy transferred
into or out of the system, the internal energy changes accordingly. Thus, the first
law of thermodynamics is a general statement of the law of conservation of energy.
Note that the conservation of energy law was not able to be formulated until
the 1800s, because it depended on the interpretation of heat as a transfer of energy.
A given system does not “have”a certain amount of heat or work. Rather, work
and heat are involved in thermodynamic processes that can change the system
from one state to another; they are not characteristic of the state itself. Quantities
which describe the state of a system, such as internal energy U, pressure P, volume V,
temperature T, and mass m or number of moles n, are called state variables.
Q and W are not state variables.
¢U = Q + W.
¢U = Q - W
