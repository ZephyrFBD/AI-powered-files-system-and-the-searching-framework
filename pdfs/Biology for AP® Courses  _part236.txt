s. Carbon binds to oxygen, hydrogen, and
nitrogen covalently to form the many molecules important for cellular function. Carbon has four electrons in its outermost
shell and can form four bonds. Carbon and hydrogen can form hydrocarbon chains or rings. Functional groups are groups
of atoms that confer specific properties to hydrocarbon (or substituted hydrocarbon) chains or rings that define their
overall chemical characteristics and function.
