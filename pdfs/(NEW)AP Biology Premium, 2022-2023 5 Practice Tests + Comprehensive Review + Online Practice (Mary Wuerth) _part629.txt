ervals do not overlap)
(C) water and rubbing alcohol (because their 95% confidence intervals do not overlap)
(D) rubbing alcohol and olive oil (because their 95% confidence intervals do overlap)
5. The student repeats the experiment, but before doing so, first coats the surface of the penny with a thin layer of
surfactant (a chemical compound that disrupts the formation of hydrogen bonds). Predict the effect the
surfactant will have on the number of drops of water that can be placed on the surface of the penny before
overflow occurs, and justify your prediction.
(A) The number of drops of water will decrease due to fewer hydrogen bonds forming between the water
molecules.
(B) The number of drops of water will decrease due to fewer polar ends forming within the water molecules.
(C) The number of drops of water will increase due to increased polar covalent bonds within the water
molecules.
(D) The number of drops of water will increase due to increased surface tension.
