s of life, 
which provide evidence of 
common ancestry.
Evidence for 
Evolution
(A) 
Incorrect. Convergent evolution results in similarly functioning traits 
in different species, and prolactin does not function similarly across 
different species.
(B) 
Correct. Prolactin is not highly conserved, because it has multiple 
functions in different organisms. Therefore, its presence in these 
organisms indicates a common origin.
(C) 
Incorrect. The passage does not indicate that prolactin always binds to 
intracellular receptors.
(D) 
Incorrect. The passage indicates that different types of organisms, not 
different organisms within a species, have varied uses for prolactin.
