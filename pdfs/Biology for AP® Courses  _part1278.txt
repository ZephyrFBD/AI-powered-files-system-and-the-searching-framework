12.1 | Mendel’s Experiments and the Laws of
Probability
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
Why was Mendel’s experimental work so successful?
•
How do the sum and product rules of probability predict the outcomes of monohybrid crosses involving dominant
and recessive alleles?

Genetics is the science of heredity. Austrian monk Gregor Mendel set the framework for genetics long before chromosomes
or genes had been identified, at a time when meiosis was not well understood. Working with garden peas, Mendel found
that crosses between true-breading parents (P) that differed in one trait (e.g., color: green peas versu
