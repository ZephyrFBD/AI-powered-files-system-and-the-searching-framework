scovery, in the middle of the twentieth century, that
DNA is the genetic material. The results of several classic experiments set the stage for an explosion of our knowledge about
DNA and how it stores and transmits genetic information. DNA was first isolated from white blood cells by Miescher in
the 1860s. Over fifty years later, Griffith’s work transforming strains of the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae provided
the first clue that DNA and not protein (as others argued) is the universal molecule of heredity. Griffith’s conclusions were
later supported by Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty.
Subsequent experiments by Hershey and Chase using the bacteriophage T2 proved decisively that DNA is the genetic
material. Shortly thereafter, Chargaff determined the ratios of adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine in DNA, suggesting
paired relationships (A = T and C = G). He also found that the percentages of A, T, C, and G are different for different
species. All of these historically important exp
