 had a lower metabolic rate 
than the mice at 25∞C. 
(C) The mice at 25∞C weighed less than the 
mice at 10∞C. 
(D) The mice at 25∞C were more active than the 
mice at 10∞C. 
 
19. According to the data, the crickets at 25∞C have 
greater oxygen consumption per gram of tissue 
than do the crickets at 10∞C. This trend in oxygen 
consumption is the opposite of that in the mice. 
The difference in trends in oxygen consumption 
among crickets and mice is due to their 
(A) relative size 
(B) mode of nutrition 
(C) mode of internal temperature regulation 
(D) mode of ATP production

20. The FtsZ protein is present in prokaryotes and in 
chloroplasts. The protein is structurally and 
functionally similar to tubulin proteins of 
eukaryotic cells. Which of the following is a 
likely conclusion to draw from this information? 
(A) FtsZ and tubulin proteins were both present 
in a common ancestor. 
(B) Microtubules are involved in the mechanics 
of
