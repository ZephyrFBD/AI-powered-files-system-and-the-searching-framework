endently. Nevertheless, the groupings given below present this varied kingdom with a degree of organization
that will help you remember them.
Algae-like (or plant-like) members of the Protista all obtain energy by photosynthesis. All have chlorophyll a but
may have various other chlorophylls and different accessory pigments.
Protozoa, or animal-like protists, are heterotrophs. They consume either living cells (thus being predatory or
parasitic) or dead organic matter.
Fungus-like protists resemble fungi because they form either filaments or spore-bearing bodies similar to the fungi.
One important group of fungus-like protists is the plasmodial slime molds. Spores germinate into cells, which feed
on organic matter. When food sources are depleted or when the environment becomes dry, the cells show “group
behavior” by aggregating into a single unit, which migrates as a “slug.” The individual cells of the slug then
mobilize to form a stalk with a capsule at the top, similar to the spore-be
