1.A
(B)
Explain how the presence of Notonecta chemical cues affects gene expression
in the Daphnia.
• The presence of Notonecta chemical cues enhanced expression of genes
associated with crest development in the Daphnia.
1 point
2.B
(C)
Predict the relative size of the crest height and width of offspring raised in the
tank without chemical cues as compared to the parent Daphnia.
• Offspring would resemble the original population.
1 point
3.B
(D)
Provide reasoning to justify your prediction in part (C).
• Without the Notonecta chemical cues, the genes for crest size would not be
affected during development.
