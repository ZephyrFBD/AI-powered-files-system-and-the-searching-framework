ozygous recessive individuals do not contribute any
dominant alleles to the population. So the frequency of the dominant allele is 
. Each of
the homozygous recessive individuals contributes two copies of the recessive allele to the population for a
total of 24 × 2 = 48 recessive alleles. The heterozygous individuals each contribute one copy of the recessive
allele to the population for a total of 46 × 1 = 46 recessive alleles. The frequency of the recessive allele is
then 
.
TIP
When solving Hardy-Weinberg problems, it is especially important to read the question carefully to understand what you are being asked to
solve for. Pay attention to words like individuals versus allele.
