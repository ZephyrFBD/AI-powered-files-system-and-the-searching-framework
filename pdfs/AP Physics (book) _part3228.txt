Partial Ionic Character of Covalent Bonds
A pure covalent bond in which the electrons are shared equally occurs mainly in
symmetrical molecules such as 
and 
When the atoms involved are
different from each other, usually the shared electrons are more likely to be in
the vicinity of one atom than the other. The extreme case is an ionic bond. In
intermediate cases the covalent bond is said to have a partial ionic character.

The molecules themselves are polar—that is, one part (or parts) of the molecule has
a net positive charge and other parts a net negative charge. An example is the
water molecule,
(Fig. 29–6). Covalent bonds have shared electrons, which
in H2O are more likely to be found around the oxygen atom than around the two
hydrogens. The reason is similar to that discussed above in connection with ionic
