t just means that each gamete gets only one of two copies of a gene. Gametes are
haploid.
What about the genotype and phenotype for this cross? Remember, genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an
organism, whereas phenotype refers to the appearance of the organism. According to the results of our Punnett
square, what is the ratio of phenotypes and genotypes in the offspring?
Let’s sum up the results. We have four offspring with two different phenotypes: three of the offspring are tall,
whereas one of them is short. On the other hand, we have three genotypes: 1 TT, 2 Tt, and 1 tt.
Here’s a summary of the results:
The ratio of phenotypes is 3:1 (three tall:one short).
The ratio of genotypes is 1:2:1 (one TT:two Tt:one tt).
The Law of Independent Assortment
So far, we have looked at only one trait: tall versus short. What happens when we study two traits at the same time?
Each allele of the two traits will get segregated into two gametes, but how one trait gets split up into gametes has
