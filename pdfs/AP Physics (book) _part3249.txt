Rotational Energy Levels in Molecules
We consider only diatomic molecules, although the analysis can be extended to
polyatomic molecules. When a diatomic molecule rotates about its center of mass
as shown in Fig. 29–15, its kinetic energy of rotation (see Section 8–7) is
where 
is the angular momentum (Section 8–8). Quantum mechanics predicts
quantization of angular momentum just as in atoms (see Eq. 28–3):
where is an integer called the rotational angular momentum quantum number.
Thus the rotational energy is quantized:
