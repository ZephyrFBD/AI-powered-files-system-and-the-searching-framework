eactions for the discharge and charge of a 
nickel–cadmium (nicad) rechargeable battery. (b) Given 
the following reduction potentials, calculate the standard 
emf of the cell:
Cd1OH221s2 + 2 e- ¡ Cd1s2 + 2 OH-1aq2 
 
E°
red = -0.76 V
NiO1OH21s2 + H2O1l2 + e- ¡ Ni1OH221s2 + OH-1aq2
 
E°
red = +0.49 V
(c) A typical nicad voltaic cell generates an emf of +1.30 V. 
Why is there a difference between this value and the one 
you calculated in part (b)? (d) Calculate the equilibrium 
constant for the overall nicad reaction based on this typical 
emf value.
 20.105  The capacity of batteries such as the typical AA alkaline 
battery is expressed in units of milliamp-hours (mAh). An 
AA alkaline battery yields a nominal capacity of 2850 mAh. 
(a) What quantity of interest to the consumer is being 
expressed by the units of mAh? (b) The starting voltage of a 
fresh alkaline battery is 1.55 V. The voltage decreases during 
discharge and is 0.80 V when the battery has delivered its 
rated capacity.
