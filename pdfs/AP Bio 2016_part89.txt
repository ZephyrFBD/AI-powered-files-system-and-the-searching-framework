cause a 1:1 phenotype ratio of blue to white among
both sexes is observed in cross 3. 
(B) The allele for blue is an autosomal dominant allele because an approximate 3:1 phenotype ratio of blue to
white is observed in cross 1. 
(C) The allele for white is an X-linked dominant allele because no white females are produced in cross 1.
(D) The allele for blue is an X-linked dominant allele because there are no blue male offspring in cross 2.

53. The table shows the changes in allele frequencies of a specific
gene in two populations of randomly mating small mammals
after 30 years. The populations inhabit adjacent equatorial
islands that have similar topography and climate. Which of
the following is the most reliable conclusion that can be
drawn from analysis of the data above?
(A) Genetic drift has occurred in population 1.
(B) Population 2 is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
(C)
