Figure 2 shows the hyperpolarizations
resulting from two light intensities (two separate stimuli are depicted on the same graph). Figure 3 is a plot of
intensity versus hyperpolarization (depicted as a change in mV from –40mV).
In Experiment 2, the Na+ was removed from the vitreous humor. The resting membrane potential changed to –
65mV and was unaffected by a light stimulus.
(a) Explain why the ability to respond to a visual stimulus would be naturally selected. Would a rod receptor
with a resting membrane potential of –65mV be selected for?
(b) Explain how the control in Experiment 1 would differ from the control in Experiment 2.
(c) Describe the relationship between a stimulus and hyperpolarization. Use evidence from the data.
(d) If the rods were bathed in fluid with a high sodium content, explain how the resting membrane potential
would change. How does the sodium change the resting membrane potential?
