ibrium occurs when genetic distribution
remains constant in large, isolated, randomly mating
populations with no mutation and no natural selection. These
conditions rarely (if ever) occur together.

1. Although many metabolic reactions are diﬀerent in distinct
organisms, the pathways associated with energy release from
nutrients are nearly identical in all organisms and depend on
molecules such as ATP, NADH, and FADH2. What is the most likely
origin of these small molecules?
They probably arose very early in a common ancestor of all
living organisms.
(A)
They probably came about through convergent evolution.
(B)
They probably exhibit small diﬀerences and cannot be
considered identical.
(C)
They probably are derived from the breakdown of common
chemical compounds.
(D)
2. The unique ecology of an island distant from the mainland has
made it a tourist attraction, bringing visitors on boats. On the
island, finches have large beaks that allow them to crack seeds.
