LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-1.N
Explain how changes in 
energy availability affect 
populations and ecosystems.
ENE-1.O 
Explain how the activities of 
autotrophs and heterotrophs 
enable the flow of energy 
within an ecosystem.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-1.N.1
Changes in energy availability can result in 
changes in population size.
ENE.1.N.2
Changes in energy availability can result in 
disruptions to an ecosystem—
a.	A change in energy resources such as 
sunlight can affect the number and size of 
the trophic levels.
b.	A change in the producer level can affect the 
number and size of other trophic levels.
ENE-1.O.1
Autotrophs capture energy from physical or 
chemical sources in the environment—
a.	Photosynthetic organisms capture energy 
present in sunlight.
b.	Chemosynthetic organisms capture energy 
from small inorganic molecules present in 
their environment, and this
