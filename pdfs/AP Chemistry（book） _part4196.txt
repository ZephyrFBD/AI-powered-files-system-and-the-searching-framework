91 Because titanium only 
has 4 valence electrons you would have to remove a core electron to 
create a Ti5 + ion. page 992 The larger the distance, the weaker the 
spin–spin interactions. page 993 Yes, it is a Lewis acid–base interac-
tion; the metal ion is the Lewis acid (electron pair acceptor).  
page 999 The nonbonding electron pairs in H2O are both located 
on the same atom, which makes it impossible for both pairs to be 
donated to the same metal atom. To act as a chelating agent the 
nonbonding electron pairs need to be on different atoms that are not 
connected to each other. page 999 Bidentate. page 1006 No, 
ammonia cannot engage in linkage isomerism—the only atom that 
can coordinate to a metal is the nitrogen. page 1006 No, a trigonal 
planar molecule cannot exhibit geometrical isomerism. page 1009 
(b) The way polarized light is rotated on passing through the sub-
stance. page 1011 (a) Co is 3Ar4 4s23d7. (b) Co3+ is 3Ar4 3d6. The Co 
atom has 3 unpaired electrons and the
