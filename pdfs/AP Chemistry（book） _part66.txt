een modified to show before and after images of the reaction. 
Finally, to stress the atomistic origins of reaction enthalpies, a 
new section (Section 5.8) on bond enthalpies has been added, 
as discussed earlier.
A new Sample Exercise has been added to Chapter 6 that 
shows how the radii of orbits in the Bohr model of the hydro-
gen atom depend on the principal quantum number and how 
the electron behavior changes when a photon is emitted or 
absorbed.
Chapter 8 has seen some of its content on bond enthalpies 
moved to Chapter 5. The concepts there are now reinforced here.
In Chapter 11, attention has been paid to the text regarding 
various intermolecular forces to make clear that chemists usu-
ally think about them in units of energy, not units of force. A 
new checklist art piece replaces old Figure 11.14 in order to make 
it clear that intermolecular interaction energies are additive.
Chapter 12 has a new A Closer Look box entitled Modern 
Materials in the Automobile which discus
