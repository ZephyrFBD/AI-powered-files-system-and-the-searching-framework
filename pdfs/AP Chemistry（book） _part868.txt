pared to that for the net ionic equation? Explain. (c) Use the 
results from (a) and (b) along with data in Appendix C to de-
termine the value of ∆Hf° for AgNO31aq2.
 5.125 A sample of a hydrocarbon is combusted completely in 
 
O21g2 to produce 21.83 g CO21g2, 4.47 g H2O1g2, and 311 kJ of 
heat. (a) What is the mass of the hydrocarbon sample that 
was combusted? (b) What is the empirical formula of the 
hydrocarbon? (c) Calculate the value of ∆Hf° per empirical- 
formula unit of the hydrocarbon. (d) Do you think that the 
hydrocarbon is one of those listed in Appendix C? Explain 
your answer.
