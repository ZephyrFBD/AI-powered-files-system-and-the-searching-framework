is short, incubate the plates at 37°C overnight. This will dry them out as well, but it 
shortens their shelf life. 
 
Refrigerated plates are good for up to 30 days. 
To prepare the agar, add 500 mL of distilled water to a one liter or larger 
Erlenmeyer flask. Add the entire content of the LB nutrient agar packet. Swirl the 
flask to dissolve the agar and heat to boiling in a microwave or water bath or by using 
a hot plate with stir bar. Heat and swirl until all the agar is dissolved. CAUTION: Be 
careful to allow the flask to cool a little before swirling so that the hot medium 
does not boil over onto your hand.

When all the agar is dissolved, allow the LB nutrient agar to cool so that the 
outside of the flask is just comfortable to hold (approximately 50°C.). While the agar 
is cooling, you can label the plates and prepare the ampicillin as outlined below in
