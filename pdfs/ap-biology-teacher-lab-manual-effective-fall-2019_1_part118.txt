 investigation? 
Different experiments will undoubtedly lead to different questions. However, knowing 
that their work will be reviewed by peers will encourage students to plan and execute lab 
investigations on their own. 
■ Mini-Posters and Presentations 
At scientific conferences, many experiments are presented as posters. However, 
requiring students to construct detailed posters for every lab investigation would be 
very time consuming. An alternative is to have students prepare “mini-posters” that 
confer a degree of authenticity to their investigative process, and incorporate peer 
review. The materials used to create mini-posters are easily accessible; students can 
use file folders and sticky notes rather than large poster boards. Mini-posters are an
