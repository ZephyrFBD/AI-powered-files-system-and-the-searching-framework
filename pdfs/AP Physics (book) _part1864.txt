es of area A separated by
a small distance d (Fig. 17–13a). Often the two plates are rolled into the form of a
cylinder with paper or other insulator separating the plates, Fig. 17–13b; Fig. 17–13c
is a photo of some actual capacitors used for various applications. In circuit diagrams,
the symbol
or             
[capacitor symbol]
represents a capacitor. A battery, which is a source of voltage, is indicated by the
symbol
[battery symbol]
with unequal arms.
If a voltage is applied across a capacitor by connecting the capacitor to a bat-
tery with conducting wires as in Fig. 17–14, charge flows from the battery to each
of the two plates: one plate acquires a negative charge, the other an equal amount
of positive charge. Each battery terminal and the plate of the capacitor connected
to it are at the same potential; hence the full battery voltage appears across the
capacitor. For a given capacitor, it is found that the amount of charge Q acquired
by each plate is proportional to the magnit
