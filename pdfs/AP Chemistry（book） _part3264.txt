could provide cathodic protection to iron: Al, Cu, Ni, Zn?
20.9 âˆ£ Electrolysis
Voltaic cells are based on spontaneous redox reactions. It is also 
possible for nonspontaneous redox reactions to occur, however, 
by using electrical energy to drive them. For example, electric-
ity can be used to decompose molten sodium chloride into its 
component elements Na and Cl2. Such processes driven by an outside source of electrical 
energy are called electrolysis reactions and take place in electrolytic cells.
An electrolytic cell consists of two electrodes immersed either in a molten salt or in 
a solution. A battery or some other source of electrical energy acts as an electron pump, 
pushing electrons into one electrode and pulling them from the other. Just as in voltaic 
cells, the electrode at which reduction occurs is called the cathode, and the electrode at 
which oxidation occurs is called the anode.
In the electrolysis of molten NaCl, Na+ ions gai
