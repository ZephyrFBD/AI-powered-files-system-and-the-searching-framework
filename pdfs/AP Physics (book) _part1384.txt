hree phases of matter differ, from the atomic 
or microscopic point of view. First of all, atoms and molecules must exert attractive
forces on each other, because only this explains why a brick or a block of aluminum
holds together in one piece.The attractive forces between molecules are of an electrical
nature (more on this in later Chapters). When molecules come too close together,
the force between them must become repulsive (electric repulsion between their
outer electrons). We need this assumption to explain that matter takes up space.
Thus molecules maintain a minimum distance from each other. In a solid material,
the attractive forces are strong enough that the atoms or molecules move only
slightly (oscillate) about relatively fixed positions, often in an array known as a
crystal lattice, as shown in Fig.13â€“2a. In a liquid, the atoms or molecules are moving
more rapidly, or the forces between them are weaker, so that they are sufficiently
free to pass around one another, as in F
