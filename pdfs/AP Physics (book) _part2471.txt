ho, in the 1890s, invented and developed wireless commu-
nication. With it, messages could be sent at the speed of light without the use of
wires. The first signals were merely long and short pulses that could be translated
into words by a code, such as the “dots” and “dashes” of the Morse code: they
were digital wireless, believe it or not. In 1895 Marconi sent wireless signals a
kilometer or two in Italy. By 1901 he had sent test signals 3000 km across the

he sent the first practical commercial messages from Cape Cod, Massachusetts,
to England: the London Times printed news items sent from its New York 
correspondent. 1903 was also the year of the first powered airplane flight by the
Wright brothers. The hallmarks of the modern age—wireless communication and
flight—date from the same year. Our modern world of wireless communication,
including radio, television, cordless phones, cell phones, Bluetooth, wi-fi,
