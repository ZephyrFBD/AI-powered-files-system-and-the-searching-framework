d use 
the solutions to determine the water potential of the plant tissues. (You might want to 
review the information on water potential described in Understanding Water Potential.) 
Use the following questions to guide your investigation: 
•  How can you measure the plant pieces to determine the rate of osmosis? 
•  How would you calculate the water potential in the cells? 
•  Which solution had a water potential equal to that of the plant cells? How do you 
know? 
•  Was the water potential in the different plants the same? 
•  How does this compare to your previous determinations in the Elodea cells? 
•  What would your results be if the potato were placed in a dry area for several days 
before your experiment? 
•  When potatoes are in the ground, do they swell with water when it rains? If not, how 
do you explain that, and if so, what would be the advantage or disadvantage?
