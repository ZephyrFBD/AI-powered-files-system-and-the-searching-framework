. As the ribosome steps across the mRNA, the former P-site tRNA enters the
E site, detaches from the amino acid, and is expelled (Figure 15.17). Amazingly, the E. coli translation apparatus takes only
0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a 200-amino acid protein can be translated in just 10 seconds.

Figure 15.17 Translation begins when an initiator tRNA anticodon recognizes a codon on mRNA. The large
ribosomal subunit joins the small subunit, and a second tRNA is recruited. As the mRNA moves relative to the
ribosome, the polypeptide chain is formed. Entry of a release factor into the A site terminates translation and the
components dissociate.
Many antibiotics inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. For example, tetracycline blocks the A site on the bacterial
ribosome, and chloramphenicol blocks peptidyl transfer. What specific effect would you expect each of these
antibiotics to have on protein synthesis?
Tetracycline would directly affect
