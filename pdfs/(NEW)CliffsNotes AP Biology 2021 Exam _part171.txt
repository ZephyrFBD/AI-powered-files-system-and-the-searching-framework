ophyll is green because it reflects green light, not absorbs it. It looks green
because the green light it reflects is the light we see. Similarly, carotenoids look orange or yellow because they
reflect those colors.
2. B. The leaves turn to these colors because, as the leaves age, the tree begins to break the chlorophyll down (to
extract its valuable components, like magnesium). In the absence of chlorophyll, the carotenoids are visible. As the
various carotenoids break down, different colors from different carotenoids become visible.
3. A. NADPH, ATP, and O2 are the products of noncyclic
 
photophosphorylation.
4. D. The molecules referenced in the question, in order of decreasing potential energy, are starch, glucose, NADPH,
and ATP. Starch is a polymer of glucose. A single glucose molecule can provide about 30 ATP molecules, and a
single NADPH can provide about 3 ATP molecules.
5. D. NADPH is produced only by noncyclic photophosphorylation. 6. C. The first step of carbon fixation o
