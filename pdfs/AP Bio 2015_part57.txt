 Which of the following best describes how 
sticklebacks in the same population with identical 
copies of the Pitx1 gene can still show phenotypic 
variation in the pelvic spine character? 
(A) The Pitx1 gene is carried on different 
chromosomes in different individuals. 
(B) Expression of the Pitx1 gene is affected by 
mutations at other genetic loci. 
(C) The genetic code of the Pitx1 gene is 
translated differently in males and females. 
(D) The subcellular location of the Pitx1 gene 
 
changes when individuals move to a new 
environment.

 A mutation that affects Pitx1 gene function in all 
tissue types is most likely to be at which of the 
following genetic loci? 
(A) Hindlimb
