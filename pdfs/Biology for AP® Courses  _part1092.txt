s.
b.
Multicellular organisms involve receptors for
signaling; single-celled organisms communicate
by fusion of plasma membrane with the nearby
cells.
c.
Multicellular organisms require more time for
signal transduction than single-celled organisms,
as they show compartmentalization.
d.
Multicellular organisms require more time for
signal transduction than single-celled organisms,
as they lack compartmentalization.
31. Biofilms are a prominent danger in infectious disease
treatment today because it is difficult to find drugs that can
penetrate the biofilm. What characteristics would a drug
have if it aimed to prevent bacteria from forming biofilms
in the first place? Explain your answer.
32. Support the hypothesis that signaling pathways
appeared early in evolution and are well-conserved using
the yeast mating factor as an example.
a.
Signaling in yeast uses the RTK pathway and is
evolutionarily conserved, like insulin signaling
in humans.
b.
Signaling in yeast uses G-protein coupled
