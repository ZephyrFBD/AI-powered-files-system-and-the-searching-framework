the wood; so the pails have the same weight.
Recovering a submerged statue. A 70-kg ancient statue
lies at the bottom of the sea. Its volume is
How much force is
needed to lift it (without acceleration)?
APPROACH The force F needed to lift the statue is equal to the statue’s 
weight mg minus the buoyant force 
Figure 10–12 is the free-body diagram.
SOLUTION We apply Newton’s second law,
which gives
or
The buoyant force on the statue due to the water is equal to the weight of
of water (for seawater,
where we use the chemical symbol for water,
, as a subscript. The weight of
the statue is
Hence the force F needed
to lift it is
It is as if the statue had a mass of only
NOTE Here
is the force needed to lift the statue without accelera-
tion when it is under water. As the statue comes out of the water, the force F
increases, reaching 690 N when the statue is fully out of the water.
F = 390 N
(390 N)A9.8 ms2B = 40 kg.
690 N - 300 N = 390 N.
mg = (70 kg)A9.8 ms2B = 6.9 * 102 N.
