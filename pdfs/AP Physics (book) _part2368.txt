1 Energy Stored in a Magnetic Field
In Section 17–9 we saw that the energy stored in a capacitor is equal to 
By using a similar argument, it can be shown that the energy U stored in an
inductance L, carrying a current I, is
Just as the energy stored in a capacitor can be considered to reside in the electric
field between its plates, so the energy in an inductor can be considered to be
stored in its magnetic field.
To write the energy in terms of the magnetic field, we quote the result of
Example 21–13 that the inductance of a solenoid is 
The magnetic
field B in a solenoid is related to the current I (see Eq. 20–8) by 
Thus,
and
We can think of this energy as residing in the volume enclosed by the windings,
which is 
Then the energy per unit volume, or energy density, is
(21;10)
This formula, which was derived for the special case of a solenoid, ca
