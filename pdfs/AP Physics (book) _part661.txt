 potential energy of
a 54-kg pole vaulter change if her center of mass rises
about 4.0 m during the jump?
27. (I) A spring has a spring constant k of 
How much
must this spring be compressed to store 45.0 J of potential
energy?
28. (II) If it requires 6.0 J of work to stretch a particular 
spring by 2.0 cm from its equilibrium length, how much more
work will be required to stretch it an additional 4.0 cm?
29. (II) A 66.5-kg hiker starts at an elevation of 1270 m and
climbs to the top of a peak 2660 m high. (a) What is the hiker’s
change in potential energy? (b) What is the minimum work
required of the hiker? (c) Can the actual work done be
greater than this? Explain.
30. (II) A 1.60-m-tall person lifts a 1.65-kg book off the ground
so it is 2.20 m above the ground. What is the potential
energy of the book relative to (a) the ground, and (b) the
top of the person’s head? (c) How is the work done by the
person related to the answers in parts (a) and (b)?
