n Fig. 32–22, are analogous to phase transitions water
undergoes as it cools from a gas condensing into a liquid, and with further cooling
freezes into ice.† The symmetry of the four forces would have been broken
leaving the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces still unified, and the universe
would have entered the grand unified era (GUT—see Section 32–11).
This scenario of a hot Big Bang is now doubted by some important theorists,
such as Andreí Linde, whose theories suggest the universe was much cooler at
the Planck time. But what happened next to the universe, though very strange, is
accepted by most cosmologists: a brilliant idea, suggested by Linde and Alan
Guth in the early 1980s, proposed that the universe underwent an incredible
exponential expansion, increasing in size by a factor of 1030 or maybe much more,
in a tiny fraction of a second, perhaps 
s or 
s. The usefulness of this
inflationary scenario is that it solved major problems with earlier Big Bang models,
such as e
