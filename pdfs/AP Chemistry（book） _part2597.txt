ffect of Cation and Anion in Solution
To determine whether a salt forms an acidic, a basic, or a neutral solution when dissolved 
in water, we must consider the action of both cation and anion. There are four possible 
combinations.
 1. If the salt contains an anion that does not react with water and a cation that does not re-
act with water, we expect the pH to be neutral. Such is the case when the anion is a con-
jugate base of a strong acid and the cation is either from group 1A or one of the heavier 
members of group 2A 1Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+2. Examples: NaCl, Ba1NO322, RbClO4.
