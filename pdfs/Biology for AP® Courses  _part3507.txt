he muscle fiber, and because
they are only approximately 1.2 Âµm in diameter, hundreds to thousands can be found inside one muscle fiber. They attach
to the sarcolemma at their ends, so that as myofibrils shorten, the entire muscle cell contracts (Figure 29.34).

Figure 29.34 A skeletal muscle cell is surrounded by a plasma membrane called the sarcolemma with a cytoplasm
called the sarcoplasm. A muscle fiber is composed of many fibrils, packaged into orderly units.
The striated appearance of skeletal muscle tissue is a result of repeating bands of the proteins actin and myosin that are
present along the length of myofibrils. Dark A bands and light I bands repeat along myofibrils, and the alignment of
myofibrils in the cell causes the entire cell to appear striated or banded.
Each I band has a dense line running vertically through the middle called a Z disc or Z lin
