his contradicts the fact that it is one of the
oldest metabolic pathways.
d.
Glycolysis is present in some organisms and
absent in others. The mentioned fact may or may
not support this assertion.
29. Red blood cells (RBCs) do not perform aerobic
respiration, but they do perform glycolysis. Why do all
cells need an energy source and what would happen if
glycolysis were blocked in a red blood cell?

a.
Cells require energy to perform certain basic
functions. Blocking glycolysis in RBCs causes
imbalance in the membrane potential, leading to
cell death.
b.
Cells need energy to perform cell division.
Blocking glycolysis in RBCs interrupts the
process of mitosis leading to nondisjunction.
c.
Cells maintain the influx and efflux of organic
substances using energy. Blocking glycolysis
stops the binding of CO2 to the RBCs, causing
cell death.
d.
Cells require energy to recognize
