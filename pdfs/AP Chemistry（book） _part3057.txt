use ∆G as a criterion for spontaneity than to use ∆Suniv 
because ∆G relates to the system alone and avoids the complication of having to exam-
ine the surroundings.
An analogy is often drawn between the free-energy change during a spontaneous 
reaction and the potential-energy change when a boulder rolls down a hill (Figure 19.14). 
Potential energy in a gravitational field “drives” the boulder until it reaches a state of 
minimum potential energy in the valley. Similarly, the free energy of a chemical system 
decreases until it reaches a minimum value. When this minimum is reached, a state of 
equilibrium exists. In any spontaneous process carried out at constant temperature and pres-
sure, the free energy always decreases.
To illustrate these ideas, let’s return to the Haber process for the synthesis of ammo-
nia from nitrogen and hydrogen, which we discussed extensively in Chapter 15:
 
N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ∆2 NH31g2 
Imagine that we have a reaction vessel that allows us to maintain a c
