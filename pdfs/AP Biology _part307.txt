s hybrid (Bb), the chance of getting an
offspring with white fur is 50% (see Punnett Square B). (IST-1)
(B) The karyotype shows an X and a Y chromosome. Therefore, this
is a male. There is an extra chromosome at the 21st position, a
situation called triploid. This is a diagnostic for Down syndrome.
(IST-1)
(C) There are 47 chromosomes in this karyotype. One gamete
donated the normal 23 chromosomes; the other gamete donated an
abnormal 24 chromosomes. The extra chromosomes resulted from

an error called nondisjunction, which occurred during meiosis, in
which one pair of chromosomes failed to separate. Choice A is not
correct because it describes normal meiotic division, which would
produce normal gametes, normal offspring, and a normal karyotype.
Choice B is not correct because the error occurred during meiosis
and the formation of gametes, not during mitosis in the babyâ€™s cells.
Choice D is not correct because crossover involves an exchange o
