ndicate whether the researcher’s claim that turtle embryos within their eggs respond to thermal 
cues is supported or not supported. Using the data, justify your response. (2 points) 
Indication (1 point) 
The researcher’s claim is supported/embryos adjust their position in response to thermal 
cues 
Justification (1 point) 
The change in angle following the shift in lateral heat source is statistically significant in 
the experimental treatment/lateral heating but not in the control treatment/dorsal heating 
Shift in lateral heat source causes a statistically significant shift in the angle of the laterally 
heated/experimental embryos compared to the shift in the dorsally heated/control embryos
