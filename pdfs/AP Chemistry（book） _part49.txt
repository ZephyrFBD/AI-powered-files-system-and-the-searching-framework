teachers is evident in our pacing, choice of examples, and the 
kinds of study aids and motivational tools we have employed. 
We believe students are more enthusiastic about learning chem-
istry when they see its importance relative to their own goals 
and interests; therefore, we have highlighted many important 
applications of chemistry in everyday life. We hope you make 
use of this material.
It is our philosophy, as authors, that the text and all the sup-
plementary materials provided to support its use must work in 
concert with you, the instructor. A textbook is only as useful to 
students as the instructor permits it to be. This book is replete 
with features that help students learn and that can guide them 
as they acquire both conceptual understanding and problem-
solving skills. There is a great deal here for the students to use, 
too much for all of it to be absorbed by any student in a one-
year course
