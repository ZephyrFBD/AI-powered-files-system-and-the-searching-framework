 between 0 and +p. If 
we square the sine function (bottom graph), we get two peaks that are 
symmetrical about the origin. Both peaks are positive because squar-
ing a negative number produces a positive number. In other words, we 
lose the phase information of the function upon squaring it.
Like the sine function, the more complicated wave functions 
for atomic orbitals can also have phases. Consider, for example, 
the representations of the 1s orbital in Figure 9.38. Note that here 
we plot this orbital a bit differently from what is shown in Section 
6.6. The origin is the point where the nucleus resides, and the wave 
function for the 1s orbital extends from the origin out into space. 
The plot shows the value of c for a slice taken along the z-axis. Below 
the plot is a contour representation of the 1s orbital. Notice that the 
value of the 1s wave function is always a positive number (we show 
positive values in red in Figure 9.38). Thus, it has only one phase. 
Notice also that
