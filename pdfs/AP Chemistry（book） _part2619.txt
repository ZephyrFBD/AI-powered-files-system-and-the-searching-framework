Thus, the ability of amino acids to act simultaneously as acids and 
bases has important effects on their properties.

Give It Some Thought
What feature must any molecule or ion have in order to act as a Lewis acid?
Our emphasis throughout this chapter has been on water as the solvent and on the 
proton as the source of acidic properties. In such cases we find the Brønsted–Lowry defi-
nition of acids and bases to be the most useful. In fact, when we speak of a substance as 
being acidic or basic, we are usually thinking of aqueous solutions and using these terms 
in the Arrhenius or Brønsted–Lowry sense. The advantage of the Lewis definitions of acid 
and base is that they allow us to treat a wider variety of reactions, including those that do 
not involve proton transfer, as acid–base reactions. To avoid confusion, a substance such 
as BF3 is rarely called an acid unless it is clear from the context that we are using the term 
in the sense of the Lewi
