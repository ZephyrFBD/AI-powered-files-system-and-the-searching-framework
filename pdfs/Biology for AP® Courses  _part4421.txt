 36.25, with two protozoan species, Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium
caudatum. When grown individually in the laboratory, they both thrive. But when they are placed together in the same test
tube (habitat), P. aurelia outcompetes P. caudatum for food, leading to the latterâ€™s eventual extinction.
Figure 36.25 Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum grow well individually, but when they compete for the
same resources, the P. aurelia outcompetes the P. caudatum.
This exclusion may be avoided if a population evolves to make use of a different resource, a different area of the habitat,
or feeds during a different time of day, called resource partitioning. The two organisms are then said to occupy different
microniches. These organisms coexist by minimizing direct competition.
Symbiosis
Symbiotic relationships, or symbioses (plural), are close interactions between individuals of different species over an
extended period of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associati
