ctivation energy. Natural
compounds readily metabolize and synthesize in the presence of
certain enzymes, and biological systems control chemical activity
largely through synchronizing the presence or absence of
enzymes. Enzymes also control the release of energy so that cells
don’t combust during certain reactions from a sudden influx of
energy.
Notice on the graph that the amount of free energy in the system changes
over the progress of the reaction. Reactants of the reaction have an initial
amount of energy, receive energy from the environment, and then energy
is released with the products. Remember that the energy of the reactants
and the energy of the products remain at the same values, whether the
reaction is enzyme mediated or not. All the enzyme does is lower the
activation energy for the molecule to do “what comes naturally” and
make the reaction happen. When the reaction is complete, the enzyme is
free and helps to speed up the reaction for another H2O2 molecule. This
