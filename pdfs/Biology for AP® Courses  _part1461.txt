romosome with equal likelihood. Whereas linkage causes alleles on the same chromosome to be inherited together,
homologous recombination biases alleles toward an inheritance pattern of independent assortment.

13.2 Chromosomal Basis of Inherited Disorders
The number, size, shape, and banding pattern of chromosomes make them easily identifiable in a karyogram and allows
for the assessment of many chromosomal abnormalities. Disorders in chromosome number, or aneuploidies, are typically
lethal to the embryo, although a few trisomic genotypes are viable. Because of X inactivation, aberrations in sex
chromosomes typically have milder phenotypic effects. Aneuploidies also include instances in which segments of a
chromosome are duplicated or deleted. Chromosome structures may also be rearranged, for example by inversion or
translocation. Both of these aberrations can result in problematic phenotypic effects. Because they force chromosomes t
