rity and then dried, and the mean dry weight per plant and the
standard error of the mean were calculated for each group. Data are shown in the table.
Crop
Mean Dry Weight per Plant Without Insecticide in Grams (± SEM*)
Mean Dry Weight per Plant in the Presence of Insecticide in Grams (±
SEM)
A
12.40 ± 0.50
14.02 ± 0.56
B
8.63 ± 0.25
10.02 ± 0.29
C
15.64 ± 0.61
19.54 ± 1.32
*Standard Error of the Mean
(a) Describe the effect of the use of the insecticide on the mean dry weight of crop B.
(b) Calculate which crop (A, B, or C) had the greatest percent increase in mean dry weight in the presence of
the insecticide. Show your work.
(c) The researcher makes the claim that use of this insecticide increases the mean dry weight of all three crops.
Using the data from the table, evaluate the researcher’s claim.
(d) Explain why the use of an insecticide could increase the yield of some agricultural crops.
