[APLO 2.5][APLO 2.16]
Energy production within a cell involves many coordinated chemical pathways. Most of these pathways are combinations of
oxidation and reduction reactions. Oxidation and reduction occur in tandem. An oxidation reaction strips an electron from
an atom in a compound, and the addition of this electron to another compound is a reduction reac
