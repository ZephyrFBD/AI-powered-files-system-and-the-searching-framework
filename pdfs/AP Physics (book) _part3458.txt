ccidents at Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania (1979), at Chernobyl, Russia (1986),
and at Fukushima, Japan (2011), have illustrated some of the dangers and have
shown that nuclear plants must be located, constructed, maintained, and oper-
ated with great care and precision (Fig. 31–9).
Finally, the lifetime of nuclear power plants is limited to 30-some years, due
to buildup of radioactivity and the fact that the structural materials themselves
are weakened by the intense conditions inside. The cost of “decommissioning” a
power plant is very great.
So-called breeder reactors were proposed as a solution to the problem of limited
supplies of fissionable uranium,

so after separation it can be used as a fuel in a nuclear reactor. Thus a breeder
