Learning Objective: 6.3
RNA viruses lack the proofreading ability of DNA polymerases. As such,
they are more likely to mutate than DNA viruses. (B) thus presents the
best explanation for Ebola’s higher mutation rate. (A) is incorrect
because it reverses the two viruses. (C) is incorrect because
retroviruses tend to mutate more quickly than DNA viruses. (D) is
incorrect because retroviruses tend to mutate about as quickly as
other RNA viruses.
9. D
Learning Objective: 6.3
RNA viruses rely on their error-prone replicases (RNA-dependent RNA
polymerases) to generate variety. This variability allows for rapid
evolution. Hence, (D) is correct. A stable genome, as suggested in (A),
is useful in unchanging environments. Adaptation to changing
environments requires variability. Viral genomes are small (on the
order of 10,000 base pairs) and typically do not encode proteins
beyond the absolute necessities. Therefore, (B) is incorrect. (C) is
wrong since
