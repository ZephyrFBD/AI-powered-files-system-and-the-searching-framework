 animals with specific desirable traits.
Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower are all varieties of a single species of wild mustard after
artificial selection of offspring possessing specific traits.
Sources of Variation
In order for natural selection to operate, there must be variation among individuals in a population. Indeed,
considerable variation exists in nearly all populations. The variation arises from or is maintained by the following
mechanisms:
1. Mutations provide the raw material for new variation. All other contributions to variation, listed here, occur by
rearranging existing alleles into new combinations. Mutations, however, can invent alleles that never before existed
in the gene pool.
Antibiotic and pesticide resistance alleles can be introduced into populations by mutation. However, these alleles
may already exist as part of the genetic variation of the population. The application of antibiotics or pesticides
eliminates those susceptible individuals,
