ntire ecosystem. What follows this destruction is the
process of sequential rebuilding of the ecosystem called ecological
succession. See Figure 12.8.

If the rebuilding begins in a lifeless area where even soil has been

removed, the process is called primary ecological succession. The
essential and dominant characteristic of primary succession is soil
building. After an ecosystem is destroyed, the first organisms to inhabit a
barren area are pioneer organisms like lichens (a symbiont consisting of
algae and fungi) and mosses, which are introduced into the area as spores
by the wind. Soil develops gradually as rocks weather and organic matter
accumulates from the decomposed remains of the pioneer organisms. Once
soil is present, pioneer organisms are overrun by other larger organisms:
grasses, bushes, and then trees. The final stable community that remains is
called the climax community. It remains until the
