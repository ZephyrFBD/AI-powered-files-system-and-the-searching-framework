chyma, and sclerenchyma cells.
Parenchyma cells are the most common plant cells (Figure 23.5). They are found in the stem, the root, the inside of the
leaf, and the pulp of the fruit. Parenchyma cells are responsible for metabolic functions, such as photosynthesis, and they
help repair and heal wounds. Some parenchyma cells also store starch.

Figure 23.5 The stem of common St John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) is shown in cross section in this light
micrograph. The central pith (greenish-blue, in the center) and peripheral cortex (narrow zone 3â€“5 cells thick just inside
the epidermis) are composed of parenchyma cells. Vascular tissue composed of xylem (red) and phloem tissue (green,
between the xylem and cortex) surrounds the pith. (credit: Rolf-Dieter Mueller)
Collenchyma cells are elongated cells with unevenly thickened walls (Figure 23.6). They provide structural support,
mainly to the stem and leaves. These cells are alive at maturity and
