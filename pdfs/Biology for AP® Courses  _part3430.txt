65. Growth hormone helps promote growth by
accelerating the rate of protein synthesis. Describe how
growth hormone switches the energy source of most cells.
a.
Growth hormone is able to break down
triglycerides through lipogenesis. When
triglycerides are released, most tissues switch to
fatty acids as energy sources.
b.
Growth hormone is able to break down
triglycerides through lipolysis. When
triglycerides are released, most tissues switch to
fatty acids as an energy source.
c.
Growth hormone is able to break down
triglycerides through lipolysis. When
triglycerides are released, most tissues switch to
glucose as an energy source.
d.
Growth hormone is able to break down
triglycerides through lipogenesis. When
triglycerides are released, most tissues switch to
glucose as an energy source.
