Creating a Formula that Predicts the Genotypes of the Next 
Generation 
Here are two approaches to develop the formula. You might first try a graphical 
approach. Create a Punnet square, like Figure 10 and similar to what you might use 
to solve a Mendelian genetics problem. In this case, however, plot the values of p and 
 
q. Scale each side of the square based on the magnitude of the p or 
 q values. Place this 
diagram in your lab notebook, and fill in the squares with variables and values, as in 
Figure 10.

Of course, you could also calculate the expected results for the next generation. 
Remember that p + q = 1 
The probability of two A alleles combining in one organism in the next generation is p2. 
The probability of two B alleles combining is q2. The probability of a combination of AB 
is p * q, as is the probability of combination of BA alleles, for a total of 2pq.
