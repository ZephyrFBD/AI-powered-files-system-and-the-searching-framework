gle with the
ground. When is it more likely to slip: when a person stands
on the ladder near the top or near the bottom? Explain.
8. A uniform meter stick supported at the 25-cm mark is in
equilibrium when a 1-kg rock is suspended at the 0-cm 
end (as shown in Fig. 9–37). Is the mass of the meter stick
greater than, equal to, or less than the mass of the rock?
Explain your reasoning.
5. A ground retaining wall is shown in Fig. 9–36a. The ground,
particularly when wet, can exert a significant force F on the
wall. (a) What force produces the torque to keep the wall
upright? (b) Explain why the retaining wall in Fig. 9–36b
would be much less likely to overturn than that in Fig.9–36a.
