equals the total number of atoms in 
SOLUTION The mass of 1 copper atom is 
This means that in a cube of copper 1 m on a side
there are
The volume of a cube of side is
so on one edge of the 1-m-long cube
there are
Hence the distance between
neighboring atoms is
NOTE Watch out for units. Even though “atoms” is not a unit, it is helpful to
include it to make sure you calculate correctly.
NOTE The distance between atoms is essentially what we mean when we speak of
the size or diameter of an atom. So we have calculated the size of a copper atom.

In everyday life, temperature is a measure of how hot or cold something is. A hot
oven is said to have a high te
