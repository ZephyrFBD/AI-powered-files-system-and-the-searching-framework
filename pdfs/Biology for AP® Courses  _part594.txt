Sodium and potassium are necessary electrolytes. As a result, the human body uses a great deal of energy keeping
these electrolytes in balance. Explain why the body needs to use energy for this process.
a.
ATP is required to move sodium ions against their concentration gradient outside the cell.
b.
ATP is required to allow entry of potassium ions inside the cell.
c.
ATP is required to allow entry of sodi
