rve, (D). (A) and (B) are incorrect because they describe
directional selection (in opposite directions). (C) is incorrect because it
describes disruptive or diversifying selection.
30. A
According to the information provided, bioluminescence is expressed
at high cell density when a high level of autoinducers promotes the
transcription of the luxCDABE genes. Thus, the correct illustration will
show greater light production when there are more V. fischeri and more
autoinducers, such as can be seen in (A). (B) is incorrect because the
cell density is shown to remain constant, instead of increasing with
increasing light production. (C) is incorrect because the level of
autoinducers is shown to remain constant, instead of increasing with
increasing light production. (D) is incorrect because it shows cell
density and autoinducer levels both decreasing with increasing light
production.

To support a close relationship between Echinodermata and Chordata,
it is necessary to find a shared
