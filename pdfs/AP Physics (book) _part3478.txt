 tokamak, first developed in Russia. A tokamak
(Fig. 31–14) is toroid-shaped (a torus, which is like a donut) and involves compli-
cated magnetic fields: current-carrying conductors produce a magnetic field
directed along the axis of the toroid (“toroidal” field); an additional field is pro-
duced by currents within the plasma itself (“poloidal” field). The combination
produces a helical field as shown in Fig. 31–14, confining the plasma, at least
briefly, so it doesn’t touch the vacuum chamber’s metal walls (Fig. 31–15a).
In 1957, J. D. Lawson showed that the product of ion density n
and confinement time must exceed a minimum value of approximately
This Lawson criterion must be reached to produce ignition, meaning fusion that
continues after all external heating is turned off. Practically, it is expected to be
achieved with

To reach break-even, the
point at which the energy output due to fusion is equal to the energy input to heat
the plasma, requires an
