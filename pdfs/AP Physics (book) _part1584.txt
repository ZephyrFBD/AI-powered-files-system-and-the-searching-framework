water? (c) Of 45 kg of water?
19. (II) The 1.20-kg head of a hammer has a speed of 
just before it strikes a nail (Fig. 14–17) and is brought to rest.
Estimate the temperature rise of a
14-g iron nail generated by
eight such hammer blows
done in quick succession.
Assume the nail absorbs

46. A soft-drink can contains about 0.35 kg of liquid at 5°C.
Drinking this liquid can actually consume some of the fat
in the body, since energy is needed to warm the liquid to
body temperature (37°C). How many food Calories should
the drink have so that it is in perfect balance with the heat
needed to warm the liquid (essentially water)?
47. (a) Estimate the total power radiated into space by the
Sun, assuming it to be a perfect emitter at
The Sun’s radius is 
(b) From this, determine
the power per unit area arriving at the Earth,
away (Fig. 14–20).

7.0 * 108 m.
T = 5500 K.
52. Estimate the rate at which
