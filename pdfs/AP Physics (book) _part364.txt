t rest on the table, so the net force on the box in each
case is zero (Newton’s first or second law). The weight of the box has magni-
tude mg in all three cases.
SOLUTION (a) The weight of the box is  
and this force acts downward. The only other force on the box is the normal
force exerted upward on it by the table, as shown in Fig. 4–15a. We chose the
upward direction as the positive y direction; then the net force 
on the box
is  
the minus sign means mg acts in the negative y direction
(m and g are magnitudes). The box is at rest, so the net force on it must be 
zero (Newton’s second law,
and  
). Thus
so we have
The normal force on the box, exerted by the table, is 98.0 N upward, and has
magnitude equal to the box’s weight.
(b) Your friend is pushing down on the box with a force of 40.0 N. So instead 
of only two forces acting on the box, now there are three forces acting on the
box, as shown in Fig. 4–15b. The weight of the box is still  
The net
force is  
and is equal to zero
