3.6 Modelling with Trigonometric Functions 
3.6.1 Simple Harmonic Motion 
Figure 1 shows the graph of y = sin t. If we think of t as time, we see that as time goes on, 
y = sin t increases and decreases over and over again. 
 
Figure 1 
The figure shows that the motion of a vibrating mass on a spring is modeled very 
accurately by y = sin t. 
 
Figure 2 
Notice that the mass returns to its original position over and over again. 
A cycle is one complete vibration of an object, so the mass in Figure 2 completes one 
cycle of its motion between O and P. 
If the equation describing the displacement y of an object at time t is 
sin
