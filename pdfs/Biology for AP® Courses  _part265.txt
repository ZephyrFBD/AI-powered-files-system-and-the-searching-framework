history. They used boiling water to mimic early Earth’s oceans. Steam from the “ocean” combined
with methane, ammonia, and hydrogen gases from the early Earth’s atmosphere and was exposed to
electrical sparks to act as lightning. As the gas mixture cooled and condensed, it was found to contain
organic compounds, such as amino acids and nucleotides. According to the abiogenesis theory, these
organic molecules came together to form the earliest form of life about 3.5 billion years ago. (credit:

Think About It
How does Stanley Miller’s and Harold Urey’s model support the claim that organic precursors present
on early Earth could have assembled into large, complex molecules necessary for life? What chemical
“ingredients” were present on early Earth?
