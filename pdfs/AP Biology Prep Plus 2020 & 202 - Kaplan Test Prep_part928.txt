d causes more frequent arousal
episodes (periods of high metabolic rate) such that bats use
energy twice as fast as healthy bats. The figure shows the relative
population of two bat species, Eptesicus fuscus and Myotis
lucifugus, hibernating from 2001 to 2010. 
Describe the abiotic and biotic factors that cause natural
selection. 
(a)
Use the data in the figure to explain how the introduction of
Pd. to the United States aﬀected the populations of M. lucifugus
and E. fuscus.
(b)
Predict the body fat content of a M. lucifugus bat with WNS
relative to that of a healthy M. lucifugus bat in 2010. 
(c)
Justify your prediction.
(d)
5. Growth curves are models used to track the rise and fall of
populations. The graph shown here depicts the population
growth curves for three diﬀerent populations of an organism.
Describe the components of the logistic growth model given

(a)
Using the information presented in the graph, determine the
carrying capacities of the three populations relative to o
