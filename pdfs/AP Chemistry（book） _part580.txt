e following equations:
Molecular equation:
 
HCl1aq2 + NaHCO31aq2 ยก NaCl1aq2 + H2O1l2 + CO21g2 
[4.20]
Net ionic equation:
 
H+1aq2 + HCO3
-1aq2 ยก H2O1l2 + CO21g2 
[4.21]
Both NaHCO31s) and Na2CO31s2 are used as neutralizers in acid spills; either salt is 
added until the fizzing caused by CO21g2 formation stops. Sometimes sodium bicarbonate is 
used as an antacid to soothe an upset stomach. In that case the HCO3
- reacts with stomach 
acid to form CO21g2.
Give It Some Thought
By analogy to examples given in the text, predict what gas forms when Na2SO3(s) 
reacts with HCl(aq).
Your stomach secretes acids to help digest foods. These acids, 
which include hydrochloric acid, contain about 0.1 mol of H+ 
per liter of solution. The stomach and digestive tract are nor-
mally protected from the corrosive effects of stomach acid by a 
mucosal lining. Holes can develop in this lining, however, al-
lowing the acid to attack the underlying tissue, causing pain-
ful damage. These holes, known as u
