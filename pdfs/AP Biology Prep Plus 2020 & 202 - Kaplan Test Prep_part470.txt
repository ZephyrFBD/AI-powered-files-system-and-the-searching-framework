mal mitotic division, all the genetic
information is copied and passed along to both daughter
cells equally.
(A)
Modifications are made to the genetic information passed on
to the mobile cell, which renders it unable to divide further.
(B)
The anchored daughter cell retains all the genetic
information so that it can continue to create new cells, while
the mobile cell retains none and later dies.
(C)
Neither cell retains the full set of genetic information a»áer
division, leading to the gradual aging of the skin.
(D)
4. Before a cell can undergo cellular division, it must progress
through an interphase stage in which the cell matures and
produces proteins needed for division. Which of the following best
describes the interphase stage?
The cell grows, replicates its DNA, and prepares to divide
during interphase. If a genetic mutation is introduced during
interphase and not repaired, the daughter cells will inherit
the mutation.
(A)
The cell grows, replicates its DNA, and prepares to divid
