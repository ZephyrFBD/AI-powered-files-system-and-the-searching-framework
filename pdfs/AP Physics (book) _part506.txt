h’s center. We subtract the Earth’s radius of 6380 km
to find that a geosynchronous satellite must orbit about 36,000 km (about 
)
above the Earth’s surface.
(b) We solve for v in the satellite equation, Eq. 5–6:
or about 11,000 km h 
We get the same result if we use
(c) The equation in part (b) for v shows
So for
