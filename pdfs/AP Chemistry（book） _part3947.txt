The process of taking the antilog of a number is the same as raising 10 to a power equal 
to that number.
antilog 1.371 = 101.371 = 23.5
Many calculators have a key labeled 10x that allows you to obtain antilogs directly. On others, 
it will be necessary to press a key labeled INV (for inverse), followed by the LOG key.
Natural Logarithms
Logarithms based on the number e are called natural, or base e, logarithms (abbreviated 
ln). The natural log of a number is the power to which e (which has the value 2.71828â€¦) 
must be raised to equal the number. For example, the natural log of 10 equals 2.303.
e2.303 = 10, therefore ln 10 = 2.303
Your calculator probably has a key labeled LN that allows you to obtain natural logarithms. For 
example, to obtain the natural log of 46.8, you e
