16–2 Electric Charge in the Atom
Only within the past century has it become clear that an understanding of electric-
ity originates inside the atom itself. In later Chapters we will discuss atomic structure
and the ideas that led to our present view of the atom in more detail. But it will
help our understanding of electricity if we discuss it briefly now.
A simplified model of an atom shows it as having a tiny but massive, positively
charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons (Fig.16–3).
The nucleus contains protons, which are positively charged, and neutrons, which
have no net electric charge. All protons and all electrons have exactly the same
magnitude of electric charge; but their signs are opposite. Hence neutral atoms,
having no n
