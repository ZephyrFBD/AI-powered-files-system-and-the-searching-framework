age weight change can be plotted on a
graph, as shown on the following page.
An imaginary line can be drawn that nearly bisects all data points. Note
where the line crosses the x-axis. At this point, there is no change in
weight of the unknown sample, which represents the point at which the
osmolarity/water potential of the unknown is the same as a known
solution equal to that point on the x-axis (on the graph, this is about
0.675 M). By assuming change in weight is linear with respect to change in
concentration, the expected concentration of a theoretical solution can
be determined. The concentration of the unknown can be estimated by
comparing it to the concentration of the theoretical solution (as we saw
in the graph above, this is approximately 0.675 M). This type of
experimental design and interpolation is very common in biological
research. The College Board expects you to be able to design simple
experiments like this to test simple hypotheses.
