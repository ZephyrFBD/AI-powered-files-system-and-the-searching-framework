5.6 The motions made by the person in the bathtub
(1)Even time：
Person in the bathtub is not motionless because he will make a series of motions
which may be very tiny and subtle. These motions, to some degree, will have the
influence on water same as stirring the water so as to speed up the balance of the
water, which contains both the balance during adding water into the bathtub and the
fusion time. As a consequence, the motions made by the person will decrease the even
time and the more motions a person make, the less time even time will be.
(2)Suffering degree:
Not only the even time, but also the fusion time will decrease due to the series of
motions. Once the time of every loop decreases, the time people suffers will
correspondingly
decrease,
which
shows
that
the
suffering
degree
will
correspondingly decrease.
