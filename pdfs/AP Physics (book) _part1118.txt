Use the data of Example 10–12.
43. (I) How fast does water flow from a hole at the bottom of 
a very wide, 4.7-m-deep storage tank filled with water?
Ignore viscosity.
44. (I) Show that Bernoulli’s equation reduces to the hydro-
static variation of pressure with depth (Eq. 10–3b) when
there is no flow
45. (II) What is the volume rate of flow of water from a
1.85-cm-diameter faucet if the pressure head is 12.0 m?
46. (II) A fish tank has dimensions 36 cm wide by 1.0 m long
by 0.60 m high. If the filter should process all the water in
the tank once every 3.0 h, what should the flow speed be 
in the 3.0-cm-diameter input tube for the filter?
47. (II) What gauge pressure in the water pipes is necessary if
a fire hose is to spray water to a height of 16 m?
48. (II) A
(inside) diameter garden hose is used to fill a
round swimming pool 6.1 m in diameter. How long will it
take to fill the pool to a depth of 1.4 m if water flows from
the
