In capillary fluid exchange, filtration pushes fluid out of the capillary
when hydrostatic pressure is greater than osmotic pressure, and
reabsorption pulls fluid into the capillary when osmotic pressure is
greater than hydrostatic pressure. Blood pumped through capillaries
supplies oxygen and nutrients to tissue cells and takes up carbon

is incorrect because the directions of the arrows for waste and
nutrients are reversed. (C) and (D) are incorrect because the directions
of the arrows for f
