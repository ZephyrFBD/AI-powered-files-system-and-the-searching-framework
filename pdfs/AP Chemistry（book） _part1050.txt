oxides MO2.
 6.108  (a) Account for formation of the following series of  
oxides 
in terms of the electron conﬁgurations of the elements 
and the discussion of ionic compounds in Section 2.7: 
K2O, CaO, Sc2O3, TiO2, V2O5, CrO3. (b) Name these oxides. 
(c) Consider the metal oxides whose enthalpies of formation 
(in kJ mol - 1) are listed here.
Oxide
K2O1s2
CaO1s2
TiO21s2
V2O51s2
∆Hf°
-363.2
-635.1
-938.7
-1550.6
 
 Calculate the enthalpy changes in the following general reac-
tion for each case:
MnOm1s2 + H21g2 ¡ nM1s2 + mH2O1g2
 
 
(You will need to write the balanced equation for each case 
and then compute ∆H°.) (d) Based on the data given, esti-
mate a value of ∆Hf° for Sc2O31s2.
 6.109  The first 25 years of the twentieth century were momen-
tous for the rapid pace of change in scientists’ under-
standing of the nature of matter. (a) How did Rutherford’s 
experiments on the scattering of a particles by a gold foil 
set the stage for Bohr’s theory of the hydrogen atom?
