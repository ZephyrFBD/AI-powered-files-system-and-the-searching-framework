process ADB.
If the pressure varies during a process, such as for the isothermal process AB
in Fig. 15–6 (and Fig. 15–2), Eq. 15–3 cannot be used directly to determine the
work. A rough estimate can be obtained, however, by using an “average” value
for P in Eq. 15–3. More accurately, the work done is equal to the area under the
PV curve. This is obvious when the pressure is constant: as Fig. 15–7a shows, the
shaded area is just 
and this is the work done. Similarly, the work
done during an isothermal process is equal to the shaded area shown in
Fig. 15–7b. The calculation of work done in this case can be carried out using 
calculus, or by estimating the area on graph paper.
