Organ pipes. What will be the fundamental frequency and
first three overtones for a 26-cm-long organ pipe at 20°C if it is (a) open, (b) closed?
APPROACH All our calculations can be based on Figs. 12–11a and 12–12a.
SOLUTION (a) For the open pipe, Fig. 12–11a, the fundamental frequency is
The speed v is the speed of sound in air (the air vibrating in the pipe). The over-
tones include all harmonics: 1320 Hz, 1980 Hz, 2640 Hz, and so on.
(b) For a closed pipe, Fig. 12–12a, the fundamental frequency is
Only odd harmonics are present: the first three overtones are 990 Hz, 1650 Hz,
and 2310 Hz.
NOTE The closed pipe plays 330 Hz, which, from Table 12–3, is E above middle C,
whereas the open pipe of the same length plays 660 Hz, an octave higher.
