number 19. In all its chemical properties, potassium is clearly a member of the alkali 
metal group. The experimental facts about the properties of potassium leave no doubt 
that the outermost electron of this element occupies an s orbital. But this means that 
the electron with the highest energy has not gone into a 3d orbital, which we might 
expect it to do. Because the 4s orbital is lower in energy than the 3d orbital (Figure 6.25), 
the condensed electron configuration of potassium is
K: 3Ar44s1
Following the complete filling of the 4s orbital (this occurs in the calcium atom), 
the next set of orbitals to be filled is the 3d. (You will find it helpful as we go along to 
refer often to the periodic table on the front-inside cover.) Beginning with scandium and 
extending through zinc, electrons are added to the five 3d orbitals until they are com-
pletely filled. Thus, the fourth row of the periodic table is ten elements wider than the 
two previous rows. These ten elements a
