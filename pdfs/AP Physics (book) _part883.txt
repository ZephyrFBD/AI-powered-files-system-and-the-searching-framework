 
If a wrench is 28 cm long,
what force perpendicular to the wrench must the mechanic
exert at its end? If the six-sided bolt head is 15 mm across
(Fig. 8–44), estimate the force applied near each of the six
points by a wrench.

30. (I) Determine the moment of inertia of a 10.8-kg sphere of
radius 0.648 m when the axis of rotation is through its center.
31. (I) Estimate the moment of inertia of a bicycle wheel 67 cm
in diameter. The rim and tire have a combined mass of
1.1 kg. The mass of the hub (at the center) can be ignored
(why?).
32. (II) A merry-go-round accelerates from rest to 
in 34 s. Assuming the merry-go-round is a uniform disk of
radius 7.0 m and mass 31,000 kg, calculate the net torque
required to accelerate it.
