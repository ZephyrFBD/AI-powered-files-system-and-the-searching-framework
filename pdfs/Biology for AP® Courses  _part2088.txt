early vertebrate bones
c.
looking in sedimentary layers next to bodies of
water in order to find marine fossils of bivalves
and trilobites
d.
using relative dating techniques to determine the
geological ages of the fossils found so they can
calculate the rate of speciation of early
organisms
63. Populations of a plant species have been found
growing in the mountains at altitudes above 2,500 meters.
Populations of a plant that appears similar, with slight
differences, have been found in the same mountains at
altitudes below 2,300 meters.
Describe a plan for collecting two kinds of data that could
provide a direct answer to the question: do the populations
growing above 2,500 meters and the populations growing
below 2,300 meters represent a single species?
a.
Scientists could take the genetic code of a plant
from each altitude and determine whether the
two sets of DNA are identical. They could also
insert genes from one plant into the cells from
the other and see if the cells survive
