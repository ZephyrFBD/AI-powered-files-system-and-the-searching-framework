tes the image of the tip of the arrow. The
image is thus behind the mirror and is virtual.
(b) We use Eq. 23–2 to find 
when
Therefore,
The minus sign means the image is behind 
the mirror,
which our diagram also showed us. The magnification is
So the image is 3.00 times
larger than the object. The plus sign indicates that the image is upright (same as
object), which is consistent with the ray diagram, Fig. 23–17.
NOTE The image distance cannot be obtained accurately by measuring on
Fig. 23–17, because our diagram violates the paraxial ray assumption (we draw
rays at steeper angles to make them clearly visible).
NOTE When the object is located inside the focal point of a concave mirror
the image is always upright and virtual. If the object O in Fig. 23–17 is
you, you see yourself clearly, because the reflected rays at point O (you) are
diverging. Your image is upright and enlarged. This is how a shaving or cosmetic
mirror is used—you must place your head closer to the mirror than the f
