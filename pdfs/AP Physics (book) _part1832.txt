ctrical phenomena. The energy concept is also a tool in solving Problems
more easily in many cases than by using forces and electric fields.

Electric Potential Energy
To apply conservation of energy, we need to define electric potential energy as we
did for other types of potential energy. As we saw in Chapter 6, potential energy
can be defined only for a conservative force. The work done by a conservative
force in moving an object between any two positions is independent of the path
taken. The electrostatic force between any two charges (Eq. 16–1,
)
is conservative because the dependence on position is just like the gravitational
force (Eq. 5–4), which is conservative. Hence we can define potential energy PE
for the electrostatic force.
We saw in Chapter 6 that the change in potential energy between any two
points, a and b, equals the negative of the work done by the conservative force on
an object as it moves from point a to poi
