8. A medical researcher working with an infertile couple measures
the number of sperm cells present in three equally-sized samples
of semen before artificial insemination. She finds that the first
sample has 125,000,000 cells/mL; the second sample has
95,000,000 cells/mL; and the third sample has 110,000,000
cells/mL. She combines all three samples and estimates that
1,100 sperm cells per initial mL of semen will reach the fallopian
tubes. Based on her estimate, what percentage of the sperm cells
will reach the fallopian tubes where fertilization occurs?
0.001%

0.1%
(B)

(C)

9. Hsp70 heat shock proteins are a family of chaperones, which are
proteins that guide the correct folding of other, newly formed
proteins. Expression of Hsp70 increases a»áer cells are subjected to
a heat shock, allowing cells to better tolerate heat st
