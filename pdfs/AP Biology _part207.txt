nd cells vary in their efficiency at
different times. Remember that during glycolysis, 2 pyruvates are formed
and each enters the Krebs cycle separately. So following glycolysis, all
numbers for FADH2, NADH, and ATP are doubled.
The catabolism (breakdown) of glucose under aerobic conditions occurs
in three sequential pathways: glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, and the citric
acid cycle, which produce the reduced coenzymes NADH and FADH2.
These coenzymes are then oxidized by the electron transport chain and
ATP is produced by oxidative phosphorylation; see Figure 6.8.

ANAEROBIC RESPIRATIONâ€”FERMENTATION
Anaerobic respiration or fermentation is not a synonym for glycolysis.
It is an anaerobic, catabolic process that consists of glycolysis plus alcohol
