• Nitrification: NH4+ to NO2− and NO2− to NO3− by various
 
nitrifying bacteria.
 
• NH4+ or NO3− to organic compounds by plant metabolism. Release: Denitrifying bacteria convert NO3− back to
 
N2(denitrification ); detritivorous bacteria convert organic compounds back to NH4+(ammonification); animals
excrete
 
NH4+ (or NH3), urea, or uric acid.
4. Phosphorus cycle. Phosphorus is required for the manufacture of ATP and all nucleic acids. Biogeochemical
cycles of other minerals, such as calcium and magnesium, are similar to the phosphorus cycle.
Reservoirs: Rocks and ocean sediments. (Erosion transfers phosphorus to water and soil; sediments and rocks that
accumulate on ocean floors return to the surface as a result of uplifting by geological processes.)
Assimilation: Plants absorb inorganic PO43− (phosphate) from
soils; animals obtain organic phosphorus when they eat plants or other animals.
Release: Plants and animals release phosphorus when they d
