rediction about the effect, if any, this would have on the
95% confidence intervals.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c) using your knowledge of how 95% confidence intervals are
calculated.
Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (B) The median is the midpoint of a data set and is not as affected by extreme values in a data set in the same
way that the mean is. Extreme values in a data set skew the mean, so choice (A) is incorrect. The mean is used
to calculate standard deviation, so standard deviation would be affected by extreme values in a data set. Thus,
choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because standard error of the mean is also affected by extreme
values in a data set.
2. (A) The mean for both data sets is 17. Choice (B) is incorrect because the median for data set A is 15, while the
median for data set B is 17. The spread for data set A (25 – 10 = 15) is larger than the spread for data set B (19
– 15 = 4), so the standard deviation and the standard error of t
