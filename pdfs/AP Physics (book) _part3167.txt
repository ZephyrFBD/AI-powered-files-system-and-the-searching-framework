X-rays are produced when electrons accelerated by a high voltage strike the
metal target inside an X-ray tube (Section 25–11). If we look at the spectrum of
wavelengths emitted by an X-ray tube, we see that the spectrum consists of two
parts: a continuous spectrum with a cutoff at some 
which depends only on the
voltage across the tube, and a series of peaks superimposed. A typical example is
shown in Fig. 28–11. The smooth curve and the cutoff wavelength 
move to the
left as the voltage across the tube increases. The sharp lines or peaks (labeled 
and 
in Fig. 28–11), however, remain at the same wavelength when the voltage
is changed, although they are located at different wavelengths when different tar-
get materials are used. This ob
