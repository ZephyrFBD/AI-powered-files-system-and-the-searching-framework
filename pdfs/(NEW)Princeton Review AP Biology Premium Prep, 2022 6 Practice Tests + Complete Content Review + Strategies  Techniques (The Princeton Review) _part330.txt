r chromosome, and eukaryotes have linear chromosomes. In eukaryotes, the DNA is
further structured, likely since linear chromosomes are more likely to get tangled. To keep it organized, the DNA is
wrapped around proteins called histones, and then the histones are bunched together in groups called a nucleosome.
Not all DNA is wound up equally, because it must be unwound in order to be read. How tightly DNA is packaged
depends on the section of DNA and also what is going on in the cell at that time. When the genetic material is in a
loose form in the nucleus, it is called euchromatin, and its genes are active, or available for transcription. When the
genetic material is fully condensed into coils, it is called heterochromatin, and its genes are generally inactive.
Situated in the nucleus, chromosomes contain the recipe for all the processes necessary for life, including passing
themselves and their information on to future generations. In this chapter, weâ€™ll look at precisely how they
