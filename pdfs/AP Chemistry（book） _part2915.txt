Note that the elevation of the land varies greatly. The aquifer follows the topography of 
the formations that underlie the area.

CHAPTER 18 Chemistry of the Environment
Dissolved Oxygen and Water Quality
The amount of O2 dissolved in water is an important indicator of water quality. Water 
fully saturated with air at 1 atm and 20 °C contains about 9 ppm of O2. Oxygen is neces-
sary for fish and most other aquatic life. Cold-water fish require water containing at least 
5 ppm of dissolved oxygen for survival. Aerobic bacteria consume dissolved oxygen to 
oxidize organic materials for energy. The organic material the bacteria are able to oxidize 
is said to be biodegradable.
Excessive quantities of biodegradable organic materials in water are detrimental 
because they remove the oxygen necessary to sustain normal animal life. Typical sources 
of these biodegradable materials, which are called oxygen-demanding wa
