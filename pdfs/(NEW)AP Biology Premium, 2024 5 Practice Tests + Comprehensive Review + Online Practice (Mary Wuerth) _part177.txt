 allosteric inhibitors of enzymes.
(c) An enzyme has its maximum efficiency at an optimum temperature of 25° Celsius. Predict what effect a
decrease in temperature to 5° Celsius would have on the enzyme’s efficiency.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
12. The enzyme catalase breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, as shown in this equation:
An experiment was performed to measure the amount of oxygen bubbles produced at two different
temperatures. The data are shown in the table.

(a) Calculate the rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction at both temperatures for the final 10 minutes of the
experiment.
(b) Predict which temperature (37°C or 45°C) is closer to the optimum temperature for this enzyme.
(c) Justify your prediction from part (b) using the data provided.
(d) In a follow-up experiment, the reaction was per
