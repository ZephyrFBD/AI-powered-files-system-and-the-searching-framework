Bridge expansion. The steel bed of a suspension bridge is
200 m long at 20°C. If the extremes of temperature to which it might be exposed
are 
to 
how much will it contract and expand?
APPROACH We assume the bridge bed will expand and contract linearly with
temperature, as given by Eq. 13–1a.
SOLUTION From Table 13–1, we find that
for steel. The
increase in length when it is at 40°C will be
or 4.8 cm. When the temperature decreases to
Then
or a decrease in length of 12 cm. The total range the expansion joints must
accommodate is
