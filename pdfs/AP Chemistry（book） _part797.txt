 
dioxide, SO2, a troublesome air pollutant. Because coal is a solid, recovery from its under-
ground deposits is expensive and often dangerous. Furthermore, coal deposits are not 
always close to locations of high-energy use, so there are often substantial shipping costs.
Fossil fuels release energy in combustion reactions, which ideally produce only CO2 
and H2O. The production of CO2 has become a major issue that involves science and 
public policy because of concerns that increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 
are causing global climate changes. We will discuss the environmental aspects of atmo-
spheric CO2 in Chapter 18.
Other Energy sources
Nuclear energy is the energy released in either the fission (splitting) or the fusion (com-
bining) of atomic nuclei. Nuclear power based on nuclear fission is currently used to pro-
duce about 19% of the electric power in the United States and makes up about 8.6% of 
the total U.S. energy production (Figure 5.26). Nuclear energy is, in
