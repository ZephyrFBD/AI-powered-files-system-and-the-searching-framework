that on a roller coaster with a circular vertical loop
(Fig. 6–51), the difference in your apparent weight at the top
of the loop and the bottom of the loop is 6.0 times your
weight. Ignore friction. Show also that as long as your speed
is above the minimum needed (so the car holds the track), this
answer doesn’t depend on the size of the loop or how fast you
go through it. [Reread Sections 6–6, 5–2, and 4–6.]

6. Suppose that the track in Fig. 6–51 is not frictionless and
the values of h and R are given. (See Sections 6–9 and 6–1.)
(a) If you measure the velocity of the roller coaster at the
top of the hill (of height h) and at the top of the circle (of
height 2R), can you determine the work done by friction
during the time the roller coaster moves between those two
points? Why or why not? (b) Can you determine the aver-
age force of friction between those two points? Why or why
not? If not, what additional information do you need?
A: (c).
B: (a) Less, because

(b)
