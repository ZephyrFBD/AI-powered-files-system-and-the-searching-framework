r, as is the case for 
the conversion of water to ice.
Despite these complicating factors, you should pay attention to 
the enthalpy changes in reactions. As a general observation, when 
the enthalpy change is large, it is the dominant factor in determin-
ing spontaneity. Thus, reactions for which ∆H is large (about 100 kJ or 
more) and negative tend to be spontaneous. Reactions for which ∆H is 
large and positive tend to be spontaneous only in the reverse direction.

▲ Figure 5.16 Exothermic reactions and spontaneity. Chemical reactions that are highly 
exothermic (∆H much less than 0) usually occur spontaneously. Such reactions often need 
some input of energy to get started, just like it can take a push to get a boulder rolling down 
a hill to a spot of lower potential energy. However, once they get started, such reactions 
spontaneously proceed to form the products, which have lower potential energy.
