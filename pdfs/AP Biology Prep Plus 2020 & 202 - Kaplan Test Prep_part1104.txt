mitted through
the soil, the ecologist worked with a molecular biologist to isolate DNA
and RNA from soil samples. They screened for genetic sequences of
known pathogens that could explain the disease. The sequencing data
did not match that of any known pathogens.
Assuming the procedures were performed correctly, what statement
would support the ecologist’s hypothesis that the infectious agent was
transmitted through the soil?
The virus causing the wasting disease was transmitted through the
air.
(A)
Bacteria in the soil caused the wasting disease, which is why viral
DNA wasn’t detected.
(B)
The wasting disease is caused by prions present in the soil.
(C)
The hypothesis can’t be correct because all bacteria and viruses
have DNA and RNA, which means the soil can’t be the source of
transmission.
(D)
36. Albinism in plants is characterized by full or partial chlorophyll
deficiency. Which of the following best describes a consequence of a
genetic mutation that gives rise to albinism?
Albin
