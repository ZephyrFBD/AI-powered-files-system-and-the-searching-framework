enth-
century physicists viewed the material world in terms of the laws of mechanics, so
it was natural for them to assume that light too must travel in some medium.
They called this transparent medium the ether and assumed it permeated all space.‡
It was therefore assumed that the velocity of light given by Maxwell’s equations
must be with respect to the ether.§
Scientists soon set out to determine the speed of the Earth relative to this
absolute frame, whatever it might be. A number of clever experiments were
designed. The most direct were performed by A. A. Michelson and E. W. Morley
in the 1880s. They measured the difference in the speed of light in different
directions using Michelson’s interferometer (Section 24–9). They expected to find
a difference depending on the orientation of their apparatus with respect to the
ether. For just as a boat has different speeds relative to the land when it moves
upstream, downstream, or across the stream, so too light would be expected to
have
