  
the 2-mol sample has twice the number of microstates and  
twice the entropy. (c) The HCl system has the higher entropy 
because the number of ways in which an HCl molecule can store 
energy is greater than the number of ways in which an Ar atom can 
store energy. (Molecules can rotate and vibrate; atoms cannot.)
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which system has the greatest entropy? (a) 1 mol of H21g2 
at STP (b) 1 mol of H21g2 at 100 °C and 0.5 atm (c) 1 mol of 
H2O1s2 at 0 °C (d) 1 mol of H2O1l2 at 25 °C
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Choose the system with the greater entropy in each case:
(a) 1 mol of H21g2 at STP or 1 mol of SO21g2 at STP
, (b) 1 mol 
of N2O41g2 at STP or 2 mol of NO21g2 at STP
.
The Third Law of Thermodynamics
If we decrease the thermal energy of a system by lowering the temperature, the energy 
stored in translational, vibrational, and rotational motion decreases. As less energy is 
stored, the entropy of the system decreases because it has fewer and fewer microstates
