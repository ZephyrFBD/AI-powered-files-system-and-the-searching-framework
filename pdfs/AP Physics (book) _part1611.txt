EXERCISE B Is the work done by the gas in process ADB of Fig. 15–6 greater than, less
than, or equal to the work done in the isothermal process AB?
Table 15–1 gives a brief summary of the processes we have discussed. Many
other types of processes can occur, but these “simple” ones are useful and can be
dealt with by fairly simple means.
Figure 15–6 shows the isotherm AB we saw in Fig. 15–2 as well as another
possible process represented by the path ADB. In going from A to D, the gas
does no work since the volume does not change. But in going from D to B,
the gas does work equal to 
and this is the total work done in the
