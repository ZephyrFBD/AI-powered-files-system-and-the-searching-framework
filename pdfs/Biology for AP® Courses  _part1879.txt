ts for the toxin to be activated. Insects that have eaten Bt toxin
stop feeding on the plants within a few hours. After the toxin is activated in the intestines of the insects, death occurs within
a couple of days. Modern biotechnology has allowed plants to encode their own crystal Bt toxin that acts against insects.
The crystal toxin genes have been cloned from Bt and introduced into plants. Bt toxin has been found to be safe for the
environment, non-toxic to humans and other mammals, and is approved for use by organic farmers as a natural insecticide.
Flavr Savr Tomato
The first GM crop was in 1994. It was a tomato that resisted rotting and maintained flavor for longer periods of time.
Antisense RNA technology was used to slow down the process of softening and rotting caused by fungal infections, which
led to increased shelf life of the GM tomatoes. Additional genetic modification improved the flavor of this tomato. This GM
tomato did not successfully stay in the market because of pr
