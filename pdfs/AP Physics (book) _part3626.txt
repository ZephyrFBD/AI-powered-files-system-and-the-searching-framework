The combination of electroweak theory plus QCD for the strong interaction
is referred to today as the Standard Model (SM) of fundamental particles.
Range of weak force. The weak nuclear force
is of very short range, meaning it acts over only a very short distance. Estimate
its range using the masses (Table 32–2) of the 
and Z:
or
APPROACH We assume the 
or 
exchange particles can exist for a 
time 
given by the uncertainty principle (Section 28–3),
where
is the energy needed to create the virtual particle 
that
carries the weak force.
SOLUTION Let 
be the distance the virtual W or Z can move before it must
be reabsorbed within the time 
To find an upper limit on 
and
hence the maximum range of the weak force, we let the W or Z travel close to
the speed of light, so
Recalling that 
then
This is indeed a very small range.
NOTE Compare this to the range of the electromagnetic force whose range is
infinite (
