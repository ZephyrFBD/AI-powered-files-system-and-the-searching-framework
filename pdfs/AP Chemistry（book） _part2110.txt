3.26 Hydrophilic colloidal particle. 
Examples of the hydrophilic groups that help 
to keep a giant molecule (macromolecule) 
suspended in water.
Hydrophobic colloids can be dispersed in water only if they are stabilized in some 
way. Otherwise, their natural lack of affinity for water causes them to separate from the 
water. One method of stabilization involves adsorbing ions on the surface of the hydro-
phobic particles (Figure 13.27). (Adsorption means to adhere to a surface. It differs from 
absorption, which means to pass into the interior, as when a sponge absorbs water.) 
The adsorbed ions can interact with water, thereby stabilizing the colloid. At the same

colloidal dispersion; that on the left contains

time, the electrostatic repulsion between adsorbed ions on neighboring colloid parti-
cles keeps the particles from sticking together rathe
