 to calculate Kp, in which case partial pressures are used 
as table entries in place of molar concentrations. Your instructor 
may refer to this kind of table as an ICE chart, where ICE stands for 
Initial – Change – Equilibrium.
▶ Practice Exercise 1
In Section 15.1, we discussed the equilibrium between 
N2O41g2 and NO21g2. Let’s return to that equation in a quanti-
tative example. When 9.2 g of frozen N2O4 is added to a 0.50 L  
reaction vessel that is heated to 400 K and allowed to come to 
equilibrium, the concentration of N2O4 is determined to be 
0.057 M. Given this information, what is the value of Kc for 
the reaction N2O41g2 ∆2 NO21g2 at 400 K? (a) 0.23  
(b) 0.36 (c) 0.13 (d) 1.4 (e) 2.5
▶ Practice Exercise 2
The gaseous compound BrCl decomposes at high tempera-
ture in a sealed container: 2 BrCl1g2 ∆Br21g2 + Cl21g2. 
Initially, the vessel is charged at 500 K with BrCl(g) at a partial 
pressure of 0.500 atm. At equilibrium, the BrCl(g) partial 
pressure is 0.040 atm. Calcula
