9–3 Applications to Muscles and Joints
The techniques we have been discussing for calculating forces on objects in equi-
librium can readily be applied to the human (or animal) body, and can be of great
use in studying the forces on muscles, bones, and joints for organisms in motion
or at rest. Generally a muscle is attached, via tendons, to two different bones, as
in Fig. 9–12. The points of attachment are called insertions. Two bones are flexibly
connected at a joint, such as those at the elbow, knee, and hip. A muscle exerts 
a pull when its fibers contract under
