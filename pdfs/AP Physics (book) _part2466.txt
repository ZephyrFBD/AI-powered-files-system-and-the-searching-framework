bsorbed by the object in a time 
and c is the speed of
light. If, instead, the radiation is fully reflected (suppose the object is a mirror), then
the momentum transferred is twice as great, just as when a ball bounces elastically
off a surface:

(22;9b)
If a surface absorbs some of the energy, and reflects some of it, then
where a has a value between 1 and 2.
Using Newton’s second law we can calculate the force and the pressure
exerted by EM radiation on an object. The force F is given by
The radiation pressure P (assuming full absorption) is given by (see Eq. 22–9a)
We discussed in Section 22–5 that the average intensity is defined as energy per
unit time per unit area:
Hence the radiation pressure is
(22;10a)
If the light is fully reflected, the radiation pressure is twice as great (Eq. 22–9b):
