13. (II) (a) Use the curve of Fig. 29–17 to estimate the stiffness
constant k for the 
molecule. (Recall that 
)
(b) Then estimate the fundamental wavelength for vibra-
tional transitions using the classical formula (Chapter 11),
but use only the mass of an H atom (because both H atoms
move).

The
molecular weight of NaCl is 58.44. Estimate the distance
between nearest neighbor Na and Cl ions. [Hint: Each ion
can be considered to be at the corner of a cube.]

ions in a NaCl crystal is 0.24 nm. What is the spacing between
two nearest neighbor Na ions?
