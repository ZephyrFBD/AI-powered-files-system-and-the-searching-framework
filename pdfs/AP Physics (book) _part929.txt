Putting in
we find that
Figure 9–9 shows a uniform beam that extends beyond its support like a
diving board. Such a beam is called a cantilever. The forces acting on the beam 
in Fig. 9–9 are those due to the supports,
and 
and the force of gravity
which acts at the CG, 5.0 m to the right of the right-hand support. If you follow
the procedure of the last Example and calculate 
and 
assuming they point
upward as shown in Fig. 9–9, you will find that

beam has a mass of 1200 kg and a weight
then
and
(see Problem 10). Whenever an unknown force comes out
negative, it merely means that the force actually points in the opposite direction
from what you assumed. Thus in Fig. 9–9,
actually must pull downward (by
means of bolts, screws, fasteners, and/or glue). To see why 
has to act downward,
note that the board’s weight acting at the CG would othe
