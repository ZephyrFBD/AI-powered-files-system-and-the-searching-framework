esults are shown
in Figure 1. The samples were then leȇ to dry for 72 hours and then weighed again
(dry weight), in order to estimate their biomass. Results are shown in Figure 2.

40. Which of the following, if true, would help support the findings of the
experiment?
Crops such as field beans, onions, peas, and red clover are
particularly sensitive to salinity.
(A)
In areas where evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation, soil
salinization is very common.
(B)
Peas grown in sandy loam with a high EC produce taller plants with
more peas per pod than those grown in sandy loam with a low EC.
(C)
Soybeans grown in clay loam with a high EC produce fewer beans
per plant than those grown in clay loam with a low EC.
(D)
41. The pH of saline soils tends to be alkaline, which can aﬀect nutrient
availability in the
