s. (Satellites are 
smaller colonies that grow around the larger transformed colony.) What observations 
can you make about the satellites? Do they look like transformed bacteria? How can 
you tell if the satellites contain the plasmid? Design and conduct an experiment to 
determine if the E. coli satellite colonies from your genetic transformation experiment 
are transformed, too. Available to you are the same chemicals, supplies, and equipment 
you used in the previous investigation.

■ Where Can You Go from Here? 
The background to this investigation asks you to think about several applications 
of genetic transformation, including genetically modified food and possible ethical, 
social, or medical issues raised by the manipulation of DNA by biotechnology. Why are 
these “issues”? What questions are posed by genetic engineering? In terms of what you 
have learned about biotechnology, how would you respond to the quote from Michael 
Crichton’s
