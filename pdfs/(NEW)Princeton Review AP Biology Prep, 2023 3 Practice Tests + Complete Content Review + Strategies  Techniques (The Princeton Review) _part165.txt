e cases, the folding of proteins involves other proteins known as chaperone proteins
(chaperonins). They help the protein fold properly and make the process more efficient.
Lipids
Like carbohydrates, lipids consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, but not in the 1:2:1 ratio typical of
carbohydrates. The most common examples of lipids are triglycerides, phospholipids, and steroids. Lipids are
important because, due to their nonpolar structures, they function as structural components of cell membranes,
sources of insulation, signaling molecules, and a means of energy storage.
Triglycerides
Our bodies store fat in tissue called adipose, which is made of cells called adipocytes; these cells are filled with
lipids called triglycerides. Each triglyceride is made of a glycerol molecule (sometimes called the glycerol
backbone) with three fatty acid chains attached to it. A fatty acid chain is mostly a long chain of carbons in which
each carbon is covered in hydrogen. One end of the chain
