 internal signals, transmit and
integrate information, and produce responses.
All functions performed by the nervous system—from a simple motor reflex to more advanced functions like making a
memory or a decision—require neurons to communicate with one another. While humans use words and body language to
communicate, neurons use electrical and chemical signals. Just like a person in a committee, one neuron usually receives
and synthesizes messages from multiple other neurons before “making the decision” to send the message on to other
neurons.
Nerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron
For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals. These signals are possible because
each neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge
of this membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental
stimuli. To understand how neurons communicate, one
