Like prokaryotic cells, the transcription of genes in eukaryotes requires the actions of an RNA polymerase to bind to a
sequence upstream of a gene to initiate transcription. However, unlike prokaryotic cells, the eukaryotic RNA polymerase
requires other proteins, or transcription factors, to facilitate transcription initiation. Transcription factors are proteins
that bind to the promoter sequence and other regulatory sequences to control the transcription of the target gene. RNA
polymerase by itself cannot initiate transcription in eukaryotic cells. Transcription factors must bind to the promoter region
first and recruit RNA polymerase to the site for transcription to be established.
The activity of transcription factors can regulate differential gene expression in cells, resulting in the development of
different cell products and functions. For example, scientists have found that primary sexual characteristics is regulated
by several genes Figure 16.9. In the frui
