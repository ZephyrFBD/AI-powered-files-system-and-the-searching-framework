anchorage dependence; they can travel throughout the body, which
is called metastasis. (IST-1)
(C) This choice is true because the homologous pairs of
chromosomes are shown paired up in preparation for separating
from each other, as you would expect in meiosis I. The other choices
could be either meiosis I or II or mitosis. (IST-1)
(C) This choice is true for the reason given in the answer explanation
to Question 10. Meiosis produces daughter cells with half the
number of chromosomes. (IST-1)
(B) The illustration consists of one homologous pair of

chromosomes. Before the crossing-over event, each homologue
consisted of two identical sister chromatids. If one chromatid
contained genes A, d, and G, its sister chromatid must have had the
same A, d, and G genes. The same is true of the other chromosome,
in which both sister chromatids contain a, D, and g genes. After
crossing-over, the G and g genes on the two t
