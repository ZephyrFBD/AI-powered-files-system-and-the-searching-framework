  An absorption spectrum indicates the relative amount of light absorbed across a range of wavelengths. 
The graphs above represent the absorption spectra of individual pigments isolated from two different 
organisms. One of the pigments is chlorophyll a, commonly found in green plants. The other pigment is 
bacteriorhodopsin, commonly found in purple photosynthetic bacteria. The table above shows the 
approximate ranges of wavelengths of different colors in the visible light spectrum. 
(a) Identify the pigment (chlorophyll a or bacteriorhodopsin) used to generate the absorption 
spectrum in each of the graphs above. Explain and jus
