op additional strategies. 
With your new spreadsheet model, generate your own questions regarding the 
evolution of allele frequencies in a population. From these questions (noted in your lab 
notebook), you need to develop hypotheses that you can test — those that allow you to 
easily manipulate the parameters of population size, number of generations, selection 
(fitness), mutation, migration, and genetic drift. Collect sufficient data by running 
your model repeatedly. Analyze your data. Formulate your conclusions and present a 
miniposter that supports your claim with sound reasoning and evidence to the class. 
Your teacher may have some ideas for questions to investigate.
