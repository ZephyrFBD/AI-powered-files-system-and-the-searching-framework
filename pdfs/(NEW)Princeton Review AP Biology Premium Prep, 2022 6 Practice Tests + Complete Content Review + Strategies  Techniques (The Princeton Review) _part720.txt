ed out of
the cell. Explain how inhibition of glycolysis likely achieves this. (3 points)
The sodium-potassium pump is an example of active transport. It pumps sodium ions out of the cell. This experiment
was measuring the amount of sodium in the media and the pump might alter the results. To keep it turned off, the cell
needs to lack the energy to run the pump. By preventing glycolysis, the cell is kept deficient in ATP and the pump will
remain off. Glycolysis is part of cell respiration, and it begins with glucose and turns it into pyruvate.
c. Analyze the data and explain how the levels of glucose and sodium inside the cell change throughout the
experiment. (2 points)
The glucose appears to disappear from the media and so it must be entering the cell. At first it enters the cell
quickly and then slows down. The sodium enters the cell quickly, and keeps entering at the quick rate for longer than the
glucose. The media is almost depleted of sodium so the sodium must be very high insid
