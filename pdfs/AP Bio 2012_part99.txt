This option is correct. It demonstrates an ability to refine and/or interpret a 
representation to explain the synthesis of a biological polymer. Peptides or 
proteins are polymers of amino acid monomers arranged in a unique linear 
sequence. Each of the 20 amino acids consists of a carbon atom surrounded 
by an amine group (NH2), a carboxyl group (COOH), a hydrogen, and an R 
(variable) group. When two amino acids are positioned so that the carboxyl 
group of one amino acid backbone is adjacent to the amine group of another 
amino acid backbone, they can join by a dehydration reaction.
(B)
This option is incorrect. The dipeptide in the figure incorrectly shows a covalent 
bond between adjacent amine (NH2) groups, and the “amino acid” shown is not 
an amino acid because the molecule lacks an amine group.
(C)
This option is incorrect. The dipeptide in the figure incorrectly shows a covalent 
bond between adjacent carboxyl (COOH) groups between adjacent amino acids, 
and the “amino acid
