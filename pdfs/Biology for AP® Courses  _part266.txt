Carbohydrates provide energy for the cell and structural support to plants, fungi, and arthropods such as insects, spiders, and
crustaceans. Consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the ratio CH2O or carbon hydrated with water, carbohydrates
are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides depending on the number of monomers in the
macromolecule. Monosaccharides are linked by glycosidic bonds that form as a result of dehydration synthesis. Glucose,
galactose, and fructose are common isomeric monosaccharides, whereas sucrose or table sugar is a disaccharide. Examples
of polysaccharides include cellulose and starch in plants and glycogen in animals. Although storing glucose in the form
of polymers like starch or glycogen makes it less accessible for metabolism, this prevents it
