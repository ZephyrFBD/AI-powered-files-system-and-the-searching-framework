(A)
This option is incorrect. Plate I is the positive control, showing that the bacteria 
were viable before the transformation procedure.
(B)
This option is correct. Only the E. coli that have been transformed and contain 
the ampr gene will grow and produce colonies.
(C)
This option is incorrect. The transformation experiment did not determine 
whether E. coli bacteria could mutate or not.
(D)
This option is incorrect. Both plates with plasmids showed growth while the plate 
with ampicillin and no plasmids showed no growth, indicating that plasmids did 
not inhibit growth.
