consumption,
day and night, in a typical house is 960 W. What initial
mass of 
would have to undergo fission to supply the
electrical needs of such a house for a year? (Assume
200 MeV is released per fission, as well as 100% efficiency.)
21. (II) Consider the fission reaction
(a) How many neutrons are produced in this reaction?
(b) Calculate the energy release. The atomic masses for 
Sb and Nb isotopes are 132.915250 u and 97.910328 u,
respectively.
22. (II) How much mass of 
is required to produce the
same amount of energy as burning 1.0 kg of coal (about
23. (II) What initial mass of 
is required to operate a
950-MW reactor for 1 yr? Assume 34% efficiency.
24. (II) If a 1.0-MeV neutron emitted in a fission reaction
loses one-half of its kinetic energy in each collision with
moderator nuclei, how many collisions must it make to
reach thermal energy
25. (II) Assuming a fission of 
into two roughly equal
fragments, estimate the electric potential energy just as 
the fragments separate f
