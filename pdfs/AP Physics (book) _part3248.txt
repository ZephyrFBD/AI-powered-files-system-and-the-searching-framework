ule can absorb a photon of just the right frequency to
excite one of its ground-state electrons to an excited state. The excited electron
can then return to the ground state, emitting a photon. The energy of photons
emitted by molecules can be of the same order of magnitude as for atoms,
typically 1 to 10 eV, or less.
Additional energy levels become possible for molecules (but not for atoms)
because the molecule as a whole can rotate, and the atoms of the molecule can
vibrate relative to each other. The energy levels for both rotational and vibrational
levels are quantized, and are generally spaced much more closely (
to 
)
than the electronic levels. Each atomic energy level thus becomes a set of closely
spaced levels corresponding to the vibrational and rotational motions, Fig. 29â€“14.
Transitions from one level to another appear as many very closely spaced lines.
In fact, the lines are not always distinguishable, and these spectra are called 
band spectra. Each type of molecule has i
