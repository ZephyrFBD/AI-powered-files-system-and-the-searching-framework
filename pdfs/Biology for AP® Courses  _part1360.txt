 not inherited independently of each other. Genes that are located on separate non-
homologous chromosomes will always sort independently. However, each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of
genes, organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string. The segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced
by linkage, in which genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be
inherited as a pair. However, because of the process of recombination, or “crossover,” it is possible for two genes on the
same chromosome to behave independently, or as if they are not linked. To understand this, let’s consider the biological
basis of gene linkage and recombination.
Homologous chromosomes possess the same genes in the same linear order. The alleles may differ on homologous
chromosome pairs, but the genes to which they correspond do not. In preparation for the first division of meiosis,
homologous chromosomes replicate and synapse. Like
