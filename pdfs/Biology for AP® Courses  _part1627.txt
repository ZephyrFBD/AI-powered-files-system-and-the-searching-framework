Translation is the process Golgi bodies use to synthesize proteins from amino acids. If there is an error in
this process, the correct proteins will not be made to build important body tissue or perform vital functions.

A strand of DNA has the nucleotide sequence 3'……GCT GTC AAA TTC GAT……5'. What is the sequence
of mRNA that is complementary to this DNA sequence? Using the chart of codons in the text, determine the
sequence of amino acids which can be generated from this strand of DNA.

How does degeneracy of the genetic code make cells less vulnerable to mutations? What is an advantage of
degeneracy with respect to the negative impact of random mutations on natural selection and evolution?
Degeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations. Codons that specify
the same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide. In addition, amino acids with chemically similar s
