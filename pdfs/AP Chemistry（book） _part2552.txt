Ka is called the acid-dissociation constant for acid HA.
Table 16.2 shows the structural formulas, conjugate bases, and Ka values for a number 
of weak acids. Appendix D provides a more complete list. Many weak acids are organic 
compounds composed entirely of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These compounds usu-
ally contain some hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms and some bonded to oxygen 
atoms. In almost all cases, the hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon do not ionize in water; 
instead, the acidic behavior of these compounds is due to the hydrogen atoms attached 
to oxygen atoms.
The magnitude of Ka indicates the tendency of the acid to ionize in water: The larger 
the value of Ka, the stronger the acid. Chlorous acid 1HClO22, for example, is the strongest 
acid in Table 16.2, and phenol 1HOC6H52 is the weakest. For most weak acids Ka values 
range from 10-2 to 10-10.
