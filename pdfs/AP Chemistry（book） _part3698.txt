n atom, the NO2
- ligand is called nitro; 
when it coordinates through the oxygen atom, 
it is called nitrito and is generally written ONO-. 
The isomers shown in Figure 23.20 have different 
properties. The nitro isomer is yellow, for exam-
ple, whereas the nitrito isomer is red.
Another ligand capable of coordinating 
through either of two donor atoms is thiocyanate, 
SCN-, whose potential donor atoms are N and S.
Do the molecules have
the same atoms?
Do the same 
ligands bind to 
the metal ion?
Do the molecules have
the same bonds (atoms
linked to the same
partners)?
