How Cells Divide (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/how_cells_dvide) .
Single-celled organisms, like amoebas, reproduce by mitosis. Explain how the genetic makeup of these organisms
differs from organisms that undergo meiosis.
a.
Organisms reproducing through mitosis produce genetically different daughter cells whereas those producing
through meiosis have genetically identical daughter cells.
b.
Crossing over or mixing of chromosomes does not occur in meiosis whereas it is preval
