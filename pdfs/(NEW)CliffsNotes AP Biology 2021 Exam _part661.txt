tial. Limiting factors
are categorized into density-dependent and density-independent factors, as follows:
Density-dependent factors are those agents whose limiting effect becomes more intense as the population density
increases. Examples include parasites and disease (transmission rates increase with population density), competition
for resources (food, nesting materials, and space for growth or reproduction, including nesting sites and sunlight for
photosynthesis), and the toxic effect of waste products. Also, predation is frequently density-dependent. In some
animals, reproductive behavior may be abandoned when populations attain high densities. In such cases, stress may
be a density-dependent limiting factor.
Density-independent factors occur independently of the density of the population. Natural disasters (fires,
earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions) and extremes of climate (storms, floods, and frosts) are common examples.
The growth of a population can be described by the followi
