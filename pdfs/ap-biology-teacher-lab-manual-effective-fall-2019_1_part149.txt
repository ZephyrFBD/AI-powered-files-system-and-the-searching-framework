ur investigation will explore the real world of biology, and
that is messy.
For example, Investigation 1: Artificial Selection presents the problem of selection
of quantitative variation in a population of plants. You identify a trait that can be
quantified (counted), and then measure the variation in the population of plants by

counting. This is not always as easy as it sounds. You will notice that some of the plants 
in your population are more hairy than others, so this is the trait you select. What 
do you count? All the hairs? Some of the hairs on specific parts of the plant? On how 
many plants? After observing one of your plants more closely, you see that it has very 
few (if any) hairs, but another plant has hundreds. These hairs are small. You have a 
limited amount of time to make your counts. How do you sample the population? After 
discussion with your lab partner(s), you and your class decide to count just the hairs on 
the first true leaf â€™s petiole (
