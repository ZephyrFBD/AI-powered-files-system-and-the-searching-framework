 points and exchange equivalent pieces of DNA; this
process is called crossing over. Note that crossing over occurs between
homologous chromosomes and not between sister chromatids of the
same chromosome. (The latter are identical, so crossing over would not
produce any change.) Those chromatids involved are leȇ with an altered
but structurally complete set of genes. The chromosomes remain joined
at points, called chiasmata, where the crossing over occurred. Such
genetic recombination can unlink linked genes, thereby increasing the
variety of genetic combinations that can be produced via gametogenesis.
Recombination among chromosomes results in increased genetic
diversity within a species. Note that sister chromatids are no longer
identical aȇer recombination has occurred.
Metaphase I
Homologous pairs (tetrads) align at the equatorial plane, and each pair
attaches to a separate spindle fiber by its kinetochore.
Anaphase I
The homologous pairs separate and are pulled to opposite poles o
