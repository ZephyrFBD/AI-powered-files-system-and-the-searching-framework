ions from 15.0 mL of 0.200 M AgNO3 solution? (c) Given 
that a 0.150 M HCl(aq) solution costs $39.95 for 500 mL and 
that KCl costs $10/ton, which analysis procedure is more 
cost-effective?
 4.80 You want to analyze a cadmium nitrate solution. What mass 
of NaOH is needed to precipitate the Cd2+ ions from 35.0 mL 
of 0.500 M Cd(NO322 solution?
 4.81 (a) What volume of 0.115 M HClO4 solution is needed to 
neutralize 50.00 mL of 0.0875 M NaOH? (b) What volume of
