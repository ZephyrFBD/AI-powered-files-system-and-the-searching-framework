s must first be organized in ascending order: 61, 66, 67, 68, 70, 72. The middle two numbers are 67
and 68; when averaged, this produces a median of 67.5 inches ((C) is correct). Notice that if all the data
points are whole numbers, the median value must end in either 0.0 or 0.5, so you can quickly eliminate
(A) and (B) in this question. In fact, (A) and (B) give the value for mean, not median.

The test scores ordered from smallest to largest are:
32, 65, 66, 67, 68, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 75, 75, 75, 78, 82
The most frequently recurring number in the set above is 75, so this is the mode (eliminate (A) and (B)).
The smallest number is 32 and the largest is 82. The range is the difference between the two, or 50 ((D) is
correct).

This question is testing the product rule.

A
This question is testing the sum rule, but you also need to use the product rule.

In chi-square tests, a calculated Ï‡2 value is compared to a critical value (CV) from a chi-square table, like
