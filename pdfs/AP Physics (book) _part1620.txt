ion in the body. How much energy is
transformed in 24 h by a 65-kg person who spends 8.0 h sleeping, 1.0 h at moderate
physical labor, 4.0 h in light activity, and 11.0 h working at a desk or relaxing?
APPROACH The energy transformed during each activity equals the metabolic
rate (Table 15–2) multiplied by the time.
SOLUTION Table 15–2 gives the metabolic rate in watts 
Since there are
3600 s in an hour, the total energy transformed is
NOTE Since 
this is equivalent to 2800 kcal; a food
intake of 2800 Cal would compensate for this energy output. A 65-kg person
who wanted to lose weight would have to eat less than 2800 Cal a day, or
increase his or her level of activity. Exercise beats any diet technique.
4.186 * 103 J = 1 kcal,
c(8.0 h)(70 Js) + (1.0 h)(460 Js)
+ (4.0 h)(230 Js) + (11.0 h)(115 Js)d(3600 sh) = 1.15 * 107 J.

Thermodynamics—Introduction
The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved. There are, how-
