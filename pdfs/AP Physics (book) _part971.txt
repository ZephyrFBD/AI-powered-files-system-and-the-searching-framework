ineteenth century, the length of a beam
was quite limited because the strongest building materials were then stone and
brick. Hence the width of a span was limited by the size of available stones. Equally
important, stone and brick, though strong under compression—are very weak
under tension and shear; all three types of stress occur in a beam (see Fig. 9–25).
The minimal space that could be spanned using stone is shown by the closely
spaced columns of the great Greek temples (Fig. 9–21).
The semicircular arch (Figs.9–28a and b) was introduced by the ancient Romans
2000 years ago. Aside from its aesthetic appeal, it was a tremendous technolog-
ical innovation. The advantage of the “true” or semicircular arch is that, if well
designed, its wedge-shaped stones experience stress which is mainly compressive
even when supporting a large load such as the wall and roof of a cathedral.
