tehead of the Rutherford Institute was not
exaggerating when he said: ‘Databit by databit, we are building our
own electronic concentration camps.’ Canada under its Cult gofer
prime minister Justin Trudeau has taken a major step towards the
real thing with people interned against their will if they test positive
with a test not testing for the ‘virus’ when they arrive at a Canadian
airport. They are jailed in internment hotels oĞen without food or
water for long periods and with many doors failing to lock there
have been sexual assaults. The interned are being charged
sometimes $2,000 for the privilege of being abused in this way.
Trudeau is fully on board with the Cult and says the ‘Covid
pandemic’ has provided an opportunity for a global ‘reset’ to
permanently change Western civilisation. His number two, Deputy
Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, is a trustee of the World Economic
Forum and a Rhodes Scholar. The Trudeau family have long been
servants of the Cult. See The Biggest Secret
