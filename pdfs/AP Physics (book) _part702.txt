cars become attached, so they will have
the same speed, call it 
Then the total momentum after the collision is
We have assumed there are no external forces, so momentum is conserved:
Solving for 
we obtain
to the right. Their mutual speed after collision is half the initial speed of car A.
NOTE We kept symbols until the very end, so we have an equation we can use
in other (related) situations.
NOTE We haven’t included friction here. Why? Because we are examining
speeds just before and just after the very brief time interval of the collision, and
during that brief time friction can’t do much—it is ignorable (but not for long:
the cars will slow down because of friction).
