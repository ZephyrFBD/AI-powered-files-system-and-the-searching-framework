er runoff containing excess nutrients from artificial fertilizer used on land. The source of the fertilizers
(with high nitrogen and phosphate content) is not limited to agricultural practices. There are many nearby
urban areas and more than 150 rivers and streams empty into the bay that are carrying fertilizer runoff
from lawns and gardens. Thus, the decline of the Chesapeake Bay is a complex issue and requires the
cooperation of industry, agriculture, and everyday homeowners.
Of particular interest to conservationists is the oyster population; it is estimated that more than 200,000
acres of oyster reefs existed in the bay in the 1700s, but that number has now declined to only 36,000
acres. Oyster harvesting was once a major industry for Chesapeake Bay, but it declined 88 percent between
1982 and 2007. This decline was due not only to fertilizer runoff and dead zones but also to overharvesting.
Oysters require a certain minimum population density because they must be in close proximit
