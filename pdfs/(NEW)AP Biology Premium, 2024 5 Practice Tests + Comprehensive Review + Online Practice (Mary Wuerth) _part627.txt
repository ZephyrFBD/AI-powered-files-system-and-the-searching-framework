action of water molecules with sodium chloride.
Which of the following statements best explains the arrangement of the molecules in this figure?
(A) Water is nonpolar, and it can easily dissolve ionic compounds by surrounding both negative ions and
positive ions with a nonpolar ring of water molecules.
(B) Water is polar, and it can easily dissolve ionic compounds by surrounding negative ions with partially
positive hydrogen atoms and by surrounding positive ions with partially negative oxygen atoms.
(C) Water and sodium chloride are both nonpolar molecules, and this allows sodium chloride to dissolve in
water.
(D) Hydrogen bonds form between water molecules and the ions in sodium chloride.
2. The following figure shows the interaction between water molecules and a micelle (a spherical formation of
lipids dissolved in an aqueous environment).
Which of the following correctly describes the parts of the micelle labeled A and B?
(A) Part A represents the hydrophilic phosphate head of a ph
