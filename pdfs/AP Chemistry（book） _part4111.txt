18.35 (a) 235 W/m2. (b) Four sources, surface radiation, evapo-
transpiration, incoming solar radiation and convective heating, 
transfer energy to the atmosphere. Surface radiation makes the 
largest contribution and convective heating the smallest. (c) Of 
the 519 W/m2 absorbed by the atmosphere, 324 W/m2 are radiated 
back to the surface. The percentage is 62.4%. 18.37 0.099 M Na+

vary in the third significant figure. This is not surprising, because
