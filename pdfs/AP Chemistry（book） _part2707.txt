ion, CH3COO-, increases 
by 0.020 mol. We can create a table to see 
how the composition of the buffer changes 
as a result of its reaction with OH-:
Comment Note that the small amount of added NaOH changes the 
pH of water significantly. In contrast, the pH of the buffer changes 
very little when the NaOH is added, as summarized in Figure 17.4.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of these statements is true? (a) If you add strong acid 
or base to a buffer, the pH will never change. (b) In order 
to do calculations in which strong acid or base is added to 
a buffer, you only need to use the Henderson–Hasselbalch 
equation. (c) Strong bases react with strong acids, but not 
weak acids. (d) If you add a strong acid or base to a buffer, the 
buffer’s pKa or pKb will change. (e) In order to do calculations 
in which a strong acid or base is added to a buffer, you need to 
calculate the amounts of substances from the neutralization 
reaction and then equilibrate.
