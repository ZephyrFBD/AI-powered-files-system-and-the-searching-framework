4, and the frequency of the A2
allele increased from generation 1 to generation 4.
(c) The scientistâ€™s hypothesis that this population in undergoing evolution is supported by the data because the
allele frequencies are changing.
(d) If individuals with the A1A2 genotype were more likely to survive than individuals with the A1A1 or A2A2
genotypes, over time, it would be expected that eventually the frequencies of the A1 and A2 alleles would
approach 0.50.
12. (a) Wildfires could create a bottleneck effect by drastically reducing the population size so that all the
individuals who carry rare alleles (that were present in the original population) might not survive. Those rare
alleles would then be eliminated from the population.
(b) This scenario illustrates the founder effect since a very small percentage of the spotted owl population is
colonizing a new habitat and that small group might not have the same allele frequencies as that of the
original population.
(c) The genetic diversity o
