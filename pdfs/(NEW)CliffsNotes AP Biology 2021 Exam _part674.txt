The digestive floras are the bacteria and protists that live in the digestive tracts of animals. The flora receives food
and a protected habitat. In exchange, the flora helps digest otherwise indigestible foods such as cellulose, produces
vitamin K, prevents (by competitive exclusion) the growth of harmful bacteria, and carries out other beneficial
functions. To digest cellulose and other polysaccharides, the flora carries out fermentation, the products of which
provide the flora and the host with a source of energy and nutrients. Some mammals, the ruminants, which include
cows, goats, and deer, have a specialized four-chambered stomach, the rumen, which serves as a fermentation
chamber. Ruminants regurgitate their food for additional chewing to more completely break down food for more
thorough fermentation. The digestive systems of other herbivorous mammals, such as rabbits and horses, lack a
rumen, and are less efficient
