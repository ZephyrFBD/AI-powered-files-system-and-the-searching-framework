Heliotropism is the description of a response to the light of
the sun. Seedlings of sunflowers were exposed to sunlight
for 15 days. Following the 15 days of exposure to sunlight,
the seedlings were transferred to complete darkness and
their movement was monitored. This graph plots the
movement of the seedlings in the dark versus time. What
conclusion can be drawn about the light dependence of the
movement of sunflowers from the graph?
a.
The movement does require light once it is set
but it will eventually slow down, suggesting that
a “clock” molecule is degraded over time.
b.
The movement does not require light once it is
set and it will keep showing this upward and
downward trend in the same manner.
c.
The movement does not require light once it is
set and it will eventually slow down, suggesting
that a “clock” molecule nev
