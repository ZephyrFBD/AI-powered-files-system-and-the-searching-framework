 because their 
path takes them very close to an extremely 
small but highly charged nucleus.
▲ Figure 2.9 Rutherford’s A-scattering experiment. When a particles pass through a gold foil,  
most pass through undeflected but some are scattered, a few at very large angles. According  
to the plum-pudding model of the atom, the particles should experience only very minor  
deflections. The nuclear model of the atom explains why a few a particles are deflected at large  
angles. Although the nuclear atom has been depicted here as a yellow sphere, it is important to  
realize that most of the space around the nucleus contains only the low-mass electrons.
Give It Some Thought 
Would you expect the number of α particles scattered at large angles in Rutherford’s 
experiment to increase, decrease, or stay the same as the thickness of the gold foil 
increases?
