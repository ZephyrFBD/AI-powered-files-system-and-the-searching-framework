nto the A band. The region at which thick and thin filaments overlap has a dense appearance, as there is little
space between the filaments. Thin filaments do not extend all the way into the A bands, leaving a central region of the A
band that only contains thick filaments. This central region of the A band looks slightly lighter than the rest of the A band
and is called the H zone. The middle of the H zone has a vertical line called the M line, at which accessory proteins hold
together thick filaments. Both the Z disc and the M line hold myofilaments in place to maintain the structural arrangement
and layering of the myofibril. Myofibrils are connected to each other by intermediate, or desmin, filaments that attach to the
Z disc.
Thick and thin filaments are themselves composed of proteins. Thick filaments are composed of the protein myosin. The
tail of a myosin molecule connects with other myosin molecules to form the central region of a thick filament near the M
line, whereas the he
