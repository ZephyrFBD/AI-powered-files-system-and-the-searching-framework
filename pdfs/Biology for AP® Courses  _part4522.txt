 different age intervals.
d.
A researcher might propose the mortality rate of
this species is very low during the
developmental period before sexual maturity is
reached. This hypothesis can be tested by
constructing a quadrat and calculating mortality
rates at different age intervals.
56. An organism, such as an elephant, that invests in long-
term care of its offspring faces risks to its survival as a
result of this investment. Explain those risks.
a.
Organisms that invest in long-term parental care
have many offspring. Having many offspring
means there is greater risk of rapid increase in
population.
b.
Organisms that invest in long-term parental care
have few offspring. Having a limited number of
offspring means there is greater risk to the
survival of the species when a single offspring
dies.
c.
Organisms that invest in long-term parental care
have many offspring. Having many offspring
means there is greater risk to the survival of the
species when a single offspring dies.
d.
