ease in the distance of the joint to the point of insertion of the biceps muscle
from 5.0 cm to 5.5 cm can be a considerable advantage for lifting and throwing.
Champion athletes are often found to have muscle insertions farther from the joint
than the average person, and if this applies to one muscle, it usually applies to all.
As another example of the large forces acting within the human body, we
consider the muscles used to support the trunk when a person bends forward
(Fig. 9–14a). The lowest vertebra on the spinal column (fifth lumbar vertebra)
acts as a fulcrum for this bending position. The “erector spinae” muscles in the
back that support the trunk act at an effective angle of about 12° to the axis of 
the spine. Let us assume the trunk makes an angle of 30° with the horizontal.
