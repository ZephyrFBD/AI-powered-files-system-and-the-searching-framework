3. (I) A 7150-kg railroad car travels alone on a level friction-
less track with a constant speed of 
A 3350-kg
load, initially at rest, is dropped onto the car. What will be
the car’s new speed?

strikes a second car
at rest. The two stick together and move off with a speed of
What is the mass of the second car?
