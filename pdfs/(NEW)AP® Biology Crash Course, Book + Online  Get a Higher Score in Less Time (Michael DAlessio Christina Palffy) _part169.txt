Questions 5â€“6 are based on the following material.
A group of scientists created a plasmid (called the SRC plasmid) containing the following genes:
Sle: resistance to the antibiotic erythromycin
Ins: the gene for insulin
Cel: the gene that produces a binding protein that interacts with cellulose to turn on Ins gene
The scientists then used transformation techniques to insert the plasmid into some E. coli cells, while
purposely not inserting the plasmid into others. They then plated the bacteria on several different types of
agar plates. The results are shown below.
The following table shows the 5 plates that were set up and the data that were recorded after incuba
