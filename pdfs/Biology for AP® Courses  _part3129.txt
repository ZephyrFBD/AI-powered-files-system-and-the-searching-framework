 determine what areas of the brain, spinal
cord, or peripheral nervous system may be damaged. For example, to check whether the hypoglossal nerve
is functioning correctly, the neurologist will ask the patient to move his or her tongue in different ways. If the
patient does not have full control over tongue movements, then the hypoglossal nerve may be damaged
or there may be a lesion in the brainstem where the cell bodies of these neurons reside (or there could be
damage to the tongue muscle itself).
Neurologists have other tools besides a physical exam they can use to diagnose particular problems
in the nervous system. If the patient has had a seizure, for example, the neurologist can use
electroencephalography (EEG), which involves taping electrodes to the scalp to record brain activity, to try
to determine which brain regions are involved in the seizure. In suspected stroke patients, a neurologist can
use a computerized tomography (CT) scan, which is a type of X-ray, to look for blee
