discussion, therefore, it becomes important to note the units used to 
calculate Q when using Equation 19.19. The convention used for standard states is used 
when applying this equation: In determining the value of Q, the concentrations of gases 
are always expressed as partial pressures in atmospheres and solutes are expressed as their 
concentrations in molarities.
Check The experimental normal boiling point of CCl41l2 is 
76.5 °C. The small deviation of our estimate from the experimen-
tal value is due to the assumption that ∆H° and ∆S° do not change 
with temperature.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
If the normal boiling point of a liquid is 67 °C, and the 
standard molar entropy change for the boiling process is 
+100 J>K, estimate the standard molar enthalpy change for 
the boiling process.
(a) +6700 J (b) -6700 J (c) +34,000 J (d) -34,000 J
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Use data in Appendix C to estimate the normal boiling point, 
in K, for elemental bromine, Br21l2. (The experimental value
