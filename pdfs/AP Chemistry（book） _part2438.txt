Effect of Temperature Changes
Changes in concentrations or partial pressures shift equilibria without changing the 
value of the equilibrium constant. In contrast, almost every equilibrium constant 
changes as the temperature changes. For example, consider the equilibrium established 
when cobalt(II) chloride 1CoCl22 is dissolved in hydrochloric acid, HCl(aq), in the endo-
thermic reaction
Co1H2O26
2+1aq2 + 4 Cl-1aq2 ∆CoCl4
2-1aq2 + 6 H2O1l2   
∆H 7 0

Because Co1H2O26
2+ is pink and CoCl4
2- is blue, the position of this equilibrium 
is readily apparent from the color of the solution (Figure 15.14). When the solution is 
heated it turns blue, indicating that the equilibrium has shifted to form more CoCl4
2-. 
Cooling the solution leads to a pink solution, indicating that the equilibrium has 
shifted to produce more Co1H2O26
2+. We can monitor this reaction by spectroscopic 
methods, measuring the concentration of al
