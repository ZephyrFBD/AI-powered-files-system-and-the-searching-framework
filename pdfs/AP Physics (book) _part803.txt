points on the wheel, at distances 
and 
from the center, have the
same angular velocity 
because
they travel through the same angle 
in the same time interval. But the

If the angular velocity of a rotating object changes, the object as a whole—
and each point in it—has an angular acceleration. Each point also has a linear
acceleration whose direction is tangent to that point’s circular path. We use 
Eq. 8–4
to see that the angular acceleration
