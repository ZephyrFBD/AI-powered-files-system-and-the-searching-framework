Comparative Anatomy
Organisms have very diﬀerent structures that are composed of the same
basic components. For example, the human arm has the same bones as
the wing of a bat. These structures are called homologous structures
because they are considered to have arisen from a common ancestor.
Analogous structures are structures that may perform a similar function
but have not arisen from the same ancestral condition.
AP EXPERT NOTE
The wings of a bat and the wings of a butterfly are analogous
structures.
Embryology or Ontogeny
Organisms that share a more recent common ancestor have similar
modes of development. A classic example is that all vertebrate embryos
have a stage of development in which they possess gills, whether they
are aquatic or terrestrial. The presence of these more “primitive”
characteristics in the embryos of “advanced” organisms suggests that
these organisms share genetically controlled developmental physiologies
that have been passed on from th
