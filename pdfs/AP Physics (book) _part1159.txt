NOTE The maximum acceleration is a little over g, so when the floor acceler-
ates down, objects sitting on the floor will actually lose contact with the floor
momentarily, which will cause noise and serious wear.

Period and Frequency—Derivation
We can derive a formula for the period of simple harmonic motion (SHM) by
comparing SHM to an object rotating uniformly in a circle. From this same
“reference circle” we can obtain a second useful result—a formula for the posi-
tion of an oscillating ma
