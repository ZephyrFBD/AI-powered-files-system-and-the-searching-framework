nzyme and its substrate is a strong one.
The model for enzyme and substrate interactions is like a lock
and key.
During reactions, enzymes increase the number of collisions.
Below is a graph that shows the progress of a common cellular
reaction carried out in a laboratory under conditions that mimic
those of the human body. The only difference is that the reaction
vessel does not contain the enzymes that would normally be present
in the cell.

If the appropriate enzyme were added to the system, which of the
following would be true?
The reaction would not go to completion, and no product would
form without an enzyme because there would be no effective
collisions.
The amount of energy stored in the products would be the same
with or without enzymes because enzymes only alter the energy
needed to start the reaction.
The energy of activation would be higher in the enzyme-
controlled reaction be
