ing with and culturing bacteria, it is important not to introduce 
contaminating bacteria or fungi into the experiment. Because these microorganisms are 
ubiquitous, i.e., you can find them everywhere — on fingertips, bench tops, lab tables, 
etc. — you must avoid these contaminating surfaces. When working with inoculation 
loops, bulb pipettes, micropipettes, and agar plates, do not touch the tips of them (or, 
in the case of agar, the surface itself) or place them directly onto contaminating surfaces. 
Be sure to wash your hands before beginning the procedure and after — and cover your 
sneezes. Do not eat, drink, apply cosmetics, or use personal electronic devices in the work 
area. 
Working with E. coli 
The host E. coli used in this investigation, plasmids, and the subsequent transformants 
created by their combination are not pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria like the 
E. coli O157:H7 strain that has been in the news. However, handling E. coli requires 
appropriate microbiolo
