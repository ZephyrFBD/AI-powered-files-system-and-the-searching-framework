plants are monocots or
dicots.
(D)
In order to study phototropism, students placed plant seeds onto
moistened soil in darkened chambers. Each chamber had a green, red,
and blue light-emitting diode (LED) of the same intensity located equally
distant from each other. Germinated seedlings invariably grew toward
the blue LED.
7. Which of the following is a likely explanation of how plants sense
diﬀerences in the color of light?
Diﬀerent wavelengths of light aﬀect rubisco diﬀerently. Rubisco
is the enzyme that fixes carbon dioxide.
(A)
A light receptor protein changes shape when exposed to blue
light. This conformation change exposes kinase sites, which
activate a signal transduction cascade that changes gene
expression.
(B)
Diﬀerent colors of light have diﬀerent amounts of energy. This
leads to a change in soil temperature. Plant roots measure the
kinetic energy in the soil and respond by bending toward the
cooler blue light.
(C)
Light absorbed through the stomata aﬀects the rate at which
