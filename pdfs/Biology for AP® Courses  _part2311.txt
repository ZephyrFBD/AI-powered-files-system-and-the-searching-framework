y, which is used as evidence of
evolutionary relationships between sequences.
c.
A poorly conserved gene would be a good
choice, because poorly conserved genes undergo
sufficient changes during relatively short times,
which allows for the study of recent
evolutionary events.
d.
A very well conserved gene would be a good
choice, because well conserved genes show
sequence similarity, which is used as evidence of
evolutionary relationships between sequences.

In a hypothetical population of beetles, there is a wide
variety of color, matching the range of coloration of the
tree trunks on which the beetles hide from predators. The
graphs below illustrate four possible changes in the beetle
population as a result of a change in the environment due
to pollution that darkened the tree trunks. What would be
the most likely change in the coloration of the beetle

The coloration range shifted toward more
