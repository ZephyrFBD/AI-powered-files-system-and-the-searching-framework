56. (II) A 25.0-kg box is released on a 27° incline and accel-
erates down the incline at 
Find the friction force
impeding its motion. What is the coefficient of kinetic
friction?
57. (II) The block shown in Fig. 4–59 has mass  
and lies on a fixed smooth frictionless plane
tilted at an angle
to the hori-
zontal. (a) Determine the acceleration 
of the block as it slides down the plane.
(b) If the block starts from rest 12.0 m
up the plane from its base, what
will be the block’s speed when
it reaches the bottom of
the incline?

58. (II) A block is given an initial speed of 
up the 22.0°
plane shown in Fig. 4–59. (a) How far up the plane will it
go? (b) How much time elapses before it returns to its
starting point? Ignore friction.
