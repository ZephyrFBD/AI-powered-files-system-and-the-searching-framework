ents. Then the H and O atoms can combine to
form 
with the release of a great deal more energy than was put in initially.
The initial activation energy can be provided by applying an electric spark to a
mixture of 
and 
breaking a few of these molecules into H and O atoms.
When these atoms combine to form 
, a lot of energy is released (the ground
state is near the bottom of the well) which provides the activation energy needed
for further reactions: additional 
and 
molecules are broken up and
recombined to form 
The potential-energy diagrams for ionic bonds, such as NaCl, may be more
like Fig. 29–8: the 
and 
ions attract each other at distances a bit larger
than some 
but at shorter distances the overlapping of inner electron shells gives
rise to repulsion. The two atoms thus are most stable at some intermediate separa-
tion,
For partially ionic bonds, there is usually an activation energy, Fig. 29–9.
Sometimes the potential energy of a bond looks like that of Fig. 29–10. In
this ca
