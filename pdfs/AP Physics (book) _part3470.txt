In stars hotter than the Sun, it is more likely that the energy output comes
principally from the carbon (or CNO) cycle, which comprises the following
sequence of reactions:
No net carbon is consumed in this cycle and the net effect is the same as the
proton–proton chain, Eq. 31–7 (plus one extra ). The theory of the proton–
proton chain and of the carbon cycle as the source of energy for the Sun and stars
was first worked out by Hans Bethe (1906–2005) in 1939.
Stellar fusion. What is the heaviest 
element likely to be produced in fusion processes in stars?
RESPONSE Fusion is possible if the final products have more binding energy
(less mass) than the reactants, because then there is a net release of energy.
Since the binding energy curve in Fig. 31–12 (or Fig. 30–1) peaks near 
to 58 which corresponds to iron or nickel, it would not be energetically
favorable to produce elements heavier than that. Nevertheless, in the center of
massive stars
