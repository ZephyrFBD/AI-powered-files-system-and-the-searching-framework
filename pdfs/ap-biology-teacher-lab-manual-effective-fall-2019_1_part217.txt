ncies in a population. Encourage them to experiment a bit with one of these 
more sophisticated and powerful models, trying out various combinations of changes 
to parameters or various extremes of one parameter at time. This is exploration, and 
it should allow the students to generate questions that have direct implications to the 
real world. Have them record their questions in their lab notebook. Encourage them to 
systematically investigate the consequences of changing variables (parameters) on the 
system they are studying — in this case, population genetics. From these questions have 
the students develop hypotheses that can be tested with the use of more sophisticated 
models — those that allow more easily manipulated parameters of population size, 
number of generations, selection (fitness), mutation, migration, and genetic drift. 
Any number of computer-based Hardy-Weinberg simulations can be found with a  
Google search. Here are some suggestions:
