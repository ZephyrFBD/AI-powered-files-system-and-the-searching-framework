CHAPTER 10 Gases
Relating the Ideal-Gas Equation and the Gas Laws
The gas laws we discussed in Section 10.3 are special cases of the ideal-gas equation. For 
example, when n and T are held constant, the product nRT contains three constants and 
so must itself be a constant:
 
PV = nRT = constant or PV = constant 
[10.6]
Note that this rearrangement gives Boyle’s law. We see that if n and T are constant, the 
values of P and V can change, but the product PV must remain constant.
We can use Boyle’s law to determine how the volume of a gas changes when its 
pressure changes. For example, if a cylinder fitted with a movable piston holds 50.0 L of 
 
O2 gas at 18.5 atm and 21 °C, what volume will the gas occupy if the temperature is main-
tained at 21 °C while the pressure is reduced to 1.00 atm? Because the
