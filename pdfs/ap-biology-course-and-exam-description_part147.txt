 the course will help address 
this misconception. Emphasis should be on 
helping students understand when to reject 
or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
Students should understand the value and 
application of the chi-square test in additional 
contexts beyond genetics. Students should 
learn the difference between null and 
alternate hypotheses while understanding 
that the chi-square is not always the most 
appropriate statistical test to analyze the 
results of an experiment.
Developing Understanding
Unit 5 focuses on heredity and the biological concepts and processes involved in ensuring the 
continuity of life. Students learn that the storage and transmission of genetic information via 
chromosomes from one generation to the next occur through meiosis. Meiotic division ensures 
genetic diversity, which is crucial to the survival of a species. In this unit, students gain a deeper 
understanding of Mendelian genetics and learning how non-Mendelian genetics describes 
those patte
