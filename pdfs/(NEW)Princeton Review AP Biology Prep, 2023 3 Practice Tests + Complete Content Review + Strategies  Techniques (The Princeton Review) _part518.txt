transports water from roots to leaves,
while phloem transports sugars made by photosynthesis in the leaves down to the stem and roots.
Stomata are small pores present in leaves that allow CO2 to enter for photosynthesis and are also a major place
where water can exit a plant during transpiration.
LAB 12: FRUIT FLY BEHAVIOR
In this lab, fruit flies are given the choice between two environments by using a choice chamber, which allows fruit
flies to move freely between the two environments. Typically, fruit flies prefer an environment that provides either
food or a place to reproduce. They also respond to light and gravity:
Taxis is the innate movement of an organism based on some sort of stimulus. Movement toward a stimulus is
called positive taxis, while movement away from a stimulus is negative taxis. In this lab, fruit flies exhibited a
negative gravitaxis (or a movement opposite to the force of gravity) and positive phototaxis (a movement
toward a light source).
