The brain is the master processor and integrator of the nervous system. The vertebrate brain appears early in
embryonic development as three bulges. Subsequent development leads to the various parts of the adult brain.
Important features of the human brain follow:
1. The forebrain is associated with the following.
 
The cerebrum, the largest and most visible part of the brain, is characterized by convolutions (folded ridges and
grooves). Derived from the forebrain, the cerebrum is divided into two halves, the cerebral hemispheres. The
corpus callosum, a bundle of nerve fibers, connects the two halves, allowing them to communicate. Various areas
of the cerebrum are involved in speech, evaluation of stimuli, conscious thinking, abstract thought, and control of
muscle movement. The left cerebral hemisphere is associated with the right side of the body and vice versa. Also,
the left side is domina
