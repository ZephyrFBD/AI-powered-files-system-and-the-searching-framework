FIGURE 16–7 Charging by induction:
if the rod in (b) is cut into two parts,
each part will have a net charge.
FIGURE 16–6 A neutral metal rod
in (a) will acquire a positive charge
if placed in contact (b) with a
positively charged metal object.
(Electrons move as shown by the
green arrow.) This is called charging
by conduction.
16–4 Induced Charge; the Electroscope
Suppose a positively charged metal object A is brought close to an uncharged
metal object B. If the two touch, the free electrons in the neutral one are attracted
to the positively charged object and some of those electrons will pass over to it,
Fig. 16–6. Since object B, originally neutral, is now missing some of its negative
electrons, it will have a net positive charge.
