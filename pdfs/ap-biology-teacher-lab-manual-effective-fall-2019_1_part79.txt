AP inquiry instruction focuses primarily on the continuum between guided inquiry 
and open inquiry. Some structured inquiry may be required as students learn particular 
skills needed to conduct more student-directed forms of inquiry. Student activities that 
support the learning of science concepts through scientific inquiry in AP classrooms 
may include reading about known scientific theories and ideas, generating scientifically 
oriented questions, making predictions or posing preliminary hypotheses, planning 
investigations, making observations, using tools to gather and analyze data, proposing 
explanations, reviewing known theories and concepts in light of empirical data, and 
communicating the results (National Committee on Science Education Standards and
