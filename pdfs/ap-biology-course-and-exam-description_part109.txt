Perform the “toothpickase” activity, in which students use their fingers to break as many 
as 100 toothpicks in 10-second intervals (without looking) onto a paper towel. All broken 
toothpicks must remain mixed with the unbroken. Broken toothpicks should not be 
removed from the pile, and each toothpick can only be broken once. Continue breaking 
toothpicks for these total time intervals (60, 120, and 180 seconds). Students then graph 
the number of toothpicks broken versus time (10, 20, 30, 60, 120, and 180 seconds).

Have students perform a yeast fermentation lab using the sucrose solutions from 
the Diffusion and Osmosis Lab your students may have performed in Unit 2. Students 
can measure the amount of carbon dioxide produced as the dependent variable. At the 
conclusion of the lab, collect class data. Have students graph the class data, including 
error bars on their graphs. To enhance this activity, h
