Putting Concepts Together
Phosgene, a substance used in poisonous gas warfare during World War I, is so named because it was first prepared by the 
action of sunlight on a mixture of carbon monoxide and chlorine gases. Its name comes from the Greek words phos (light) and 
genes (born of). Phosgene has the following elemental composition: 12.14% C, 16.17% O, and 71.69% Cl by mass. Its molar 
mass is 98.9 g>mol. (a) Determine the molecular formula of this compound. (b) Draw three Lewis structures for the molecule 
that satisfy the octet rule for each atom. (The Cl and O atoms bond to C.) (c) Using formal charges, determine which Lewis 
structure is the dominant one. (d) Using average bond enthalpies, estimate âˆ†H for the formation of gaseous phosgene from 
CO(g) and Cl21g2.
