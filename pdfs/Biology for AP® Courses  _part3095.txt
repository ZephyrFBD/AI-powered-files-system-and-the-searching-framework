dolphins have even more.
Figure 26.23 Mammals have larger brain-to-body ratios than other vertebrates. Within mammals, increased
cortical folding and surface area is correlated with complex behavior.
Basal Ganglia
Interconnected brain areas called the basal ganglia (or basal nuclei), shown in Figure 26.20b, play important roles in
movement control and posture. Damage to the basal ganglia, as in Parkinson’s disease, leads to motor impairments like a
shuffling gait when walking. The basal ganglia also regulate motivation. For example, when a wasp sting led to bilateral
basal ganglia damage in a 25-year-old businessman, he began to spend all his days in bed and showed no interest in anything
or anybody. But when he was externally stimulated—as when someone asked to play a card game with him—he was able
to function normally. Interestingly, he and other similar patients do not report feeling bored or frustrated by their state.
Thalamus
