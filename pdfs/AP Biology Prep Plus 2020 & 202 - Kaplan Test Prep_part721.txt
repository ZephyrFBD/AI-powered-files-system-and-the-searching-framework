s in the common ancestor of the three domains would explain
its prevalence among all organisms. Hence, (B) is correct. (A) is
incorrect because the eﬀiciency of glycolysis is not at issue in the
question stem, but rather its prevalence in many organisms. (C) is
incorrect because it is more likely that glycolysis appeared once during
the early development of life than it is that it appeared independently
many times during evolution. (D) is incorrect because glycolysis does
not require the presence of mitochondria and because Bacteria and
Archaea are domains of prokaryotes, which lack mitochondria.

When the founders of an isolated population happen to have a
particular trait in large abundance, subsequent generations of that
population will likely continue to have that trait at a higher frequency
due to genetic driȇ. Because more of the founding population had
large beaks and because there were no selective pressures on beak
size, it is reasonable to expect
