he role of cells, focusing on how cells use energy 
and information transmission to communicate and replicate. Through systems of complex 
transduction pathways, cells can communicate with one another. Cells can also generate 
and receive signals, coordinate mechanisms for growth, and respond to environmental 
cues. To maintain homeostasis, cells respond to their environment. They can also replicate 
and regulate replication as part of the cell cycle that provides for the continuity of life.  
In Unit 5, students will move on to learn about heredity.
