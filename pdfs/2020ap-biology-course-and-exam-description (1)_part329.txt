e for people but toxic to mosquitoes. However, mosquito resistance to pyrethroids has 
now become widespread. Pyrethroids interfere with the function of a transmembrane sodium channel found in cells of the 
mosquitoes (Figure 1). In one common mutation to the channel protein, a phenylalanine is substituted for a leucine at amino 
acid position 1014. Scientists hypothesize that this mutation is responsible for some cases of pyrethroid resistance.

To investigate pyrethroid resistance, mosquitoes were collected four times over a two-year period from the following  
two regions.

l Region A: a southern vegetable-growing region where large amounts of insecticide are applied for crop protection
