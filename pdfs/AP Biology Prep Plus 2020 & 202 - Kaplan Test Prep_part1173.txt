 Disruptive
selection selects the extremes, so it will not favor those with an
intermediate phenotype—perhaps those that recover from the disease but
remain in a weakened state—to pass on the desired trait, resistance to
DFTD; thus (B) is incorrect. 
59. A
Competitive inhibitors do not lower the Vmax of an enzyme, while
noncompetitive inhibitors do. Therefore, the experiment described in (A)
could be used to determine if there is a diﬀerence in Vmax in the absence
and presence of the inhibitor, and thus whether the inhibitor is a
competitive or noncompetitive inhibitor. The experiments in (B) and (C)
would not provide any information on how Vmax is aﬀected by the
inhibitor. (D) is incorrect because the inhibitor is not expected to bind to
the substrate.
60. C
Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can impact
how an enzyme functions and interacts with other molecules. Based on
the table, phosphorylation decreases enzymatic activity and increases
DNA binding. You can
