—contains only thick filaments and is shortened during contraction. The I
band contains only thin filaments and also shortens. The A band does not shorten—it remains the same length—but A bands
of different sarcomeres move closer together during contraction, eventually disappearing. Thin filaments are pulled by the
thick filaments toward the center of the sarcomere until the Z discs approach the thick filaments. The zone of overlap, in
which thin filaments and thick filaments occupy the same area, increases as the thin filaments move inward.
ATP and Muscle Contraction
The motion of muscle shortening occurs as myosin heads bind to actin and pull the actin inwards. This action requires
energy, which is provided by ATP. Myosin binds to actin at a binding site on the globular actin protein. Myosin has another
binding site for ATP at which enzymatic activity hydrolyzes ATP to ADP, releasing an inorganic phosphate molecule and
energy.
ATP binding causes myosin to release actin, allowing acti
