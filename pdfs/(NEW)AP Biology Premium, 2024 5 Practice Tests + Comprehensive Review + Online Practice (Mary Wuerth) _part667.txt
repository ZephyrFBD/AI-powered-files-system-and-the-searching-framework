s. cAMP and the calcium ion are not
ligands, so choice (B) is also incorrect.
25. (B) Gap junctions and plasmodesmata are channels that allow direct contact between cells and an exchange of
materials, so they are examples of juxtacrine signaling. Choices (A), (C), and (D) do not describe the correct
type of signaling.
26. (B) DNA is replicated during the S stage of the cell cycle. At the start of the S stage, each chromosome has one
chromatid; at the end of the S stage, each chromosome has two identical chromatids, with twice the amount of
DNA as they had at the beginning of the S stage. Choices (A), (C), and (D) are all incorrect because they list
incorrect amounts of DNA and/or incorrect numbers of chromosomes.
27. (A) Cells that are not actively dividing and are fully differentiated will leave the cell cycle and enter the G0
stage. Choice (B) is incorrect because during G1, the cell is growing and getting ready for cell division. During
the S stage, the DNA is replicated in preparat
