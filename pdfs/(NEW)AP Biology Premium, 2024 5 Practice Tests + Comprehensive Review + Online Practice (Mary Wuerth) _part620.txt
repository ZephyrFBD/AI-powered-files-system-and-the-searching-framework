s 0 bars, making its total water potential equal to its solute potential, â€“0.32 bars. Choice (A) is incorrect
because although the water potential of distilled water is 0 bars, the total water potential of the sugar beet cube
is not also 0 bars. The water potential of distilled water that is open to the atmosphere is 0 bars, which rules out
choices (C) and (D).
2. (D) ET50 values are high when the rate of photosynthesis is low. Chlorophyll appears green because it reflects,
not absorbs, wavelengths of green light, so green light will provide the least amount of energy for
photosynthesis. White light does contain all colors of the visible spectrum and would provide the most light
energy for photosynthesis, so it would have the lowest, not the highest, ET50 value. Thus, choice (A) is
incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because chlorophyll reflects, not absorbs, green light. Chlorophyll does absorb
energy from red light, so choice (C) is incorrect.
3. (A) The rate of oxygen consumption at
