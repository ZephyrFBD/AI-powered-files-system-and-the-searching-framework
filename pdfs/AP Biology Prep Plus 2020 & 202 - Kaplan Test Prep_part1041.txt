r 0.24 + 0.01 = 0.25. Thus, the frequency of the r allele (q) is the square root of 0.25, or
0.5. On the other hand, individuals with blood type F can be either homozygous or
heterozygous; therefore, the first and third rows of the table include both FF individuals
as well as Ff ones. Therefore, you cannot simply add 0.6 to 0.24 to calculate the frequency
of the F allele. Instead, you must first find the frequency of the recessive f allele (q) and
then subtract that from 1 to find the frequency of the F allele (p). The frequency of blood
type f is the sum of the second and fourth rows, or 0.15 + 0.01 = 0.16, so the frequency of
the f allele is the square root of 0.16, or 0.4. The allele frequency of F is 1 – 0.4 = 0.6.
Therefore, (C) is correct.
31. B
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium requires random mating, large population size, no natural
selection, no mutations, and no gene flow. Because (B) suggests significant gene flow
between this population and others, it is correct. The other answer
