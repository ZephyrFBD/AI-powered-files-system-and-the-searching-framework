ons called β-blockers bind to G-
protein-linked receptors in heart muscles, blocking
adrenaline. They are prescribed to patients with high blood
pressure. Can you formulate a hypothesis on their
mechanism of action?
a.
Adrenaline has a stimulatory effect on heart rate
and blood pressure. β-blockers are antagonistic
to adrenaline and produces inhibitory effect.
b.
Adrenaline has both a stimulatory and an
inhibitory effect on heart rate and blood
pressure. β-blockers bind to G-protein and
stimulate the inhibitory effect of adrenaline.
c.
Adrenaline has an inhibitory effect on heart rate
and blood pressure. β-blockers have a synergistic
effect along with adrenaline producing an
inhibitory effect.
d.
Adrenaline has both a stimulatory and an
inhibitory effect on heart rate and blood
pressure. β-blockers bind to G-protein and
intervene with the inhibitory effect of adrenaline.
