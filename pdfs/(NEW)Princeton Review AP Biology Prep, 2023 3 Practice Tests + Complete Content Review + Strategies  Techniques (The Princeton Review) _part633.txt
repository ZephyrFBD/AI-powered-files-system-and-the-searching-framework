especially with regard to food supply. In his theory, they
accomplish this by altruistic restraint on the part of individuals who reduce their reproduction, or refrain
altogether, to avoid overpopulation. Thus altruism is favored by natural selection.
For example, small birds of the species Parus major typically produce nine or ten eggs per clutch, although
they have been observed to produce as many as thirteen eggs per clutch. Data show that a clutch size larger
than nine or ten actually produces fewer surviving offspring. See Figure 1; the vertical axis gives the percent
occurrence of each brood size, and the numbers labeling the dots indicate the number of known survivors per
nest.

Additional evidence for the group-selection theory is that there appears to be a relationship between
reproductive success of individuals and the density of the population. When density is low, mortality is
likewise low and reproductive rate high. At high numbers resources are more scarce, and it
