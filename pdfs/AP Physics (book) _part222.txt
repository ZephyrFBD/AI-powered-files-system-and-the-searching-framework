er will it go
than it would on Earth, assuming the same initial velocity?
61. A person who is properly restrained by an over-the-shoulder
seat belt has a good chance of surviving a car collision if the
deceleration does not exceed 30 “g’s”
Assuming uniform deceleration at 30 g’s, calculate the dis-
tance over which the front end of the car must be designed
to collapse if a crash brings the car to rest from 
62. A person jumps out a fourth-story window 18.0 m above
a firefighter’s safety net. The survivor stretches the net
1.0 m before coming
to rest,

(a) What was the
average deceleration
experienced by the
survivor when she was
slowed to rest by the
net? (b) What would
you do to make it
“safer” (that is,
to
generate a smaller
deceleration): would
you stiffen or loosen
the net? Explain.
