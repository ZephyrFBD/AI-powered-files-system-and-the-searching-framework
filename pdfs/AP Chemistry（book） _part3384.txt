ions (Equations 
21.19 and 21.20) to calculate the time elapsed since the rock was 
formed, we first need to calculate how much initial uranium-238 
there was for every 1 mg that remains today.

CHAPTER 21 Nuclear Chemistry
If we start with 1.000 g of strontium-90, 0.953 g will remain after 2.00 yr. (a) What is the half-life of strontium-90? (b) How 
much strontium-90 will remain after 5.00 yr?
Analyze (a) We are asked to calculate a half-life, t1>2, based 
on data that tell us how much of a radioactive nucleus has 
decayed in a time interval t = 2.00 yr and the information 
N0 = 1.000 g, Nt = 0.953 g. (b) We are asked to calculate the 
amount of a radionuclide remaining after a given period of time.
Plan (a) We first calculate the rate constant for the decay, k,  
and then we use that to compute t1>2. (b) We need to calculate  
Nt, the amount of strontium present at time t, using the initial 
quantity, N0, and the rate cons
