phrine binds to a cell-surface receptor; 
the activated receptor catalyzes the 
conversion of glycogen to glucose. 
(C) Epinephrine diffuses through the plasma 
membrane; the hormone dimerizes in the 
cytosol. 
(D) Epinephrine is taken into the cell by 
endocytosis; glycogen is converted to 
glucose in the endocytotic vesicle.

mitochondrial membrane? 
(B) Do the types of phospholipids in a membrane affect the rate at 
which molecules enter a cell by passive diffusion?
