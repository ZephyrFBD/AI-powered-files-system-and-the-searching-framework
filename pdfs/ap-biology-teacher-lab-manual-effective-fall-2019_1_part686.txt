is investigation requires approximately four lab periods of about 45 minutes each. This 
includes one period for students to calculate leaf surface area and the number of stomata, 
one period for students to design an experiment(s), a minimum of one period to conduct 
an experiment(s), and one period for students to discuss and share their results and 
conclusions with the class. (If students have prepared and examined a stomatal peel in a 
prerequisite biology course, they might be able to skip this part of the investigation.) 
If students are using a potometer method to determine transpiration rate(s), data 
collected over a 24-hour period provide more quantifiable results; if using the whole 
plant method, students need to determine the mass of their plant(s) for several days. If 
time is an issue, the prelab and summative assessments can be assigned for homework. 
Students can work in pairs or small groups to accommodate different class sizes.
