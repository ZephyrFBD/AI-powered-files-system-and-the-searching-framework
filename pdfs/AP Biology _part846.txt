nd one with only ambient conditions as the control;

Here is what you can expect to happen:
Increasing the humidity, by placing a bag over or misting the
leaves, will decrease transpiration.
Increasing the light intensity will increase transpiration.
Increasing the wind with a fan will lower the humidity around the
leaves and thereby increase transpiration.

When you increase the light intensity, make sure that you also do not
increase the temperature surrounding the plant, thus, introducing another
variable. To accomplish this, place a heat sink (a large bowl or beaker of
water) between the light and the plant to absorb the heat while allowing
the light to pass through.
Since each plant does not have the same leaf surface area, your results
will be meaningless unless you can demonstrate consistency. You must
measure the surface area of the leaves on the plants and calculate the water
loss in terms of s
