es would most likely aï¬€ect the erosion of
riverbanks?
Wolves destroy vegetation along the riverbanks while
hunting. The loss of vegetation can cause erosion.
(A)
Wolves hunt elk, which graze on vegetation that protects
riverbanks from erosion. Without wolves, elk populations
increase, reducing vegetation.
(B)
Wolves competitively exclude other predators. These
predators eat plants and thus contribute to the degradation
of the riverbanks.
(C)
Wolves eat beavers, which cut down trees to build dams. The
dams slow down the flow of rivers, which decreases the
amount of erosion.
(D)
5. An octopus in an aquarium would occasionally splash water on

Michael, claims that the octopus does not like him because he
always gets drenched when he walks by. The other volunteers
insist that the drenching is purely random. Which of the following
experimental treatments would help to test the hypothesis that
the octopus learned to recognize faces?
