molar mass of the unknown? (b) As the acid 
is titrated, the pH of the solution after the addition of 
11.05 mL of the base is 4.89. What is the Ka for the acid? 
 
(c) Using Appendix D, suggest the identity of the acid.
 17.112  A sample of 7.5 L of NH3 gas at 22 °C and 735 torr is bubbled 
into a 0.50-L solution of 0.40 M HCl. Assuming that all the 
NH3 dissolves and that the volume of the solution remains 
0.50 L, calculate the pH of the resulting solution.
 17.113  Aspirin has the structural formula
 
 At body temperature 137 °C2, Ka for aspirin equals 
3 * 10-5. If two aspirin tablets, each having a mass of 
 
325 mg, are dissolved in a full stomach whose volume is 
 
1 L and whose pH is 2, what percent of the aspirin is in the 
form of neutral molecules?
 17.114  What is the pH at 25 °C of water saturated with CO2 at a 
partial pressure of 1.10 atm? The Henry’s law constant for 
CO2 at 25 °C is 3.1 * 10-2 mol>L@atm.
 17.115  Excess Ca1OH22 is shaken with water to produce a satura
