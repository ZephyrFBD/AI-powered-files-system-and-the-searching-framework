27–7 Wave–Particle Duality; the
Principle of Complementarity
The photoelectric effect, the Compton effect, and other experiments have placed
the particle theory of light on a firm experimental basis. But what about the classic
experiments of Young and others (Chapter 24) on interference and diffraction
which showed that the wave theory of light also rests on a firm experimental basis?
We seem to be in a dilemma. Some experiments indicate that light behaves like
a wave; others indicate that it behaves like a stream of particles. These two theories
seem to be incompatible, but both have been shown to have validity. Physicists
finally came to the conclusio
