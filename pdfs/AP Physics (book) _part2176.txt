20–1 Magnets and Magnetic Fields
You probably have observed a magnet attract paper clips, nails, and other objects
made of iron, as in Fig. 20–1. Any magnet, whether it is in the shape of a bar or a
horseshoe, has two ends or faces, called poles, which is where the magnetic effect
is strongest. If a bar magnet is suspended from a fine thread, it is found that one
pole of the magnet will always point toward the north. It is not known for sure
when this fact was discovered, but it is known that the Chinese were making 
use of it as an aid to navigation by the eleventh century and perhaps earlier.
This is the principle of a compass. A compass needle is simply a bar magnet which
is supported at its center of gravity so that it can rotate freely. The pole of a freely
suspended magnet that points toward geographic north is called the north pole of
the magnet. The other pole points toward the south and is calle
