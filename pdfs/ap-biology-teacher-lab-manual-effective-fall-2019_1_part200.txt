hen planted the resulting second generation of seeds, raised the plants to 
a similar life stage as the previous population, and scored the variation in the second-
generation plants. During this long process, you recorded your observations, reflections, 
and perhaps some questions in your laboratory notebook. 
As you worked, you likely started to think about questions of your own. You might 
want to know why the trait you tested is even variable to start with. How does it help the 
plants grow and survive? You might also have identified some other trait that you want 
to explore instead of the one the class chose. 
Does one form or another of the trait offer an advantage in the natural world? How 
could you test this? Phenotypic variation is the result of the interaction of the genotypic 
variation with the variables in the environment. How much of the variation that you 
studied could be the result of environmental differences? 
You and your class may decide to do this work as a clas
