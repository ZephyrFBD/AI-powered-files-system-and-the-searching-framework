from the
photosynthetic leaves to the rest of the plant by active transport.
Phosphodiester linkages The bonds that join the nucleotides in DNA.
Phosphofructokinase (PFK) An allosteric enzyme important in
glycolysis.
Phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) A three-carbon sugar, the first stable
carbohydrate to be produced by photosynthesis.
Photolysis The process of splitting water, providing electrons to replace
those lost from chlorophyll a in P680. This is powered by the light
energy absorbed during the light-dependent reactions.
Photoperiod The environmental stimulus a plant uses to detect the time of
year and the relative lengths of day and night.
Photophosphorylation The process of generating ATP by means of a
proton motive force during the light reactions of photosynthesis.
Photorespiration A process that occurs when rubisco binds with O2
instead of CO2. It is a dead-end process because no ATP is produced
and no sugar is formed.
Photosynthesis The process by which light energy is converted
