the power supply, and then disconnect BOTH leads from the power supply. Remember,

■ THE INVESTIGATIONS 
■ Getting Started 
■ Activity I: Restriction Enzymes 
The DNA samples collected from the crime scene have been digested with restriction  
enzymes to generate smaller pieces of DNA, which will then be used to create DNA  
profiles of suspects.  
Restriction enzymes are essential tools for analyzing DNA structure, and more 
than 200 enzymes are now available commercially. Each restriction enzyme is named 
for the bacterium in which it was first identified; for example, EcoRI was the first 
enzyme purified from Escherichia coli, and 
 HindIII was the third enzyme isolated from 
Haemophilus influenzae. Scientists have hypothesized
