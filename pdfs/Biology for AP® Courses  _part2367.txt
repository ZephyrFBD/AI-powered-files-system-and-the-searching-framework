n as horizontal transmission, and when they are inherited from a parent, this is called
vertical transmission.
Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host (Table 21.4). One common symptom is hyperplasia, the
abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls. Other viruses induce hypoplasia,
or decreased cell growth, in the leaves of plants, causing thin, yellow areas to appear. Still other viruses affect the plant by
directly killing plant cells, a process known as cell necrosis. Other symptoms of plant viruses include malformed leaves,
black streaks on the stems of the plants, altered growth of stems, leaves, or fruits, and ring spots, which are circular or linear
areas of discoloration found in a leaf.
