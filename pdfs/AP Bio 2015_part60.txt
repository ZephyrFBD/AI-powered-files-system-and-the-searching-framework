 
Hydrangea 
 macrophylla to DNA sequence 
information for a different species of 
flowering plant 
(B) Performing a genetic cross between a pink-
flowered plant and a blue-flowered plant 
and then determining the ratio of 
phenotypes in the offspring 
 
(C) Growing cuttings from the same Hydrangea 
 
macrophylla plant under controlled 
conditions that vary only with regard to 
soil pH 
(D) Analyzing fossilized remains of an ancestral 
species that grew in geographic areas 
similar to the habitats of modern Hydrangea 
 
macrophylla 
 
24. 
 Based on morphological characteristics, the 
phylogenetic tree above has been developed for 
species I, II, III, and IV. DNA sequencing has 
recently been completed for a particular gene 
found in all four species. The sequencing will 
provide additional information for answering 
which of the following questions? 
(A) Is species I the common ancestor of species II 
and III? 
(B) Does species I contain the greatest number of 
vestigial structures?
