▶Practice Exercise 2
Which of the following atoms and ions is largest: S2 -, S, O2 -?
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Arrange the following atoms and ions in order of increas-
ing ionic radius: F, S2 -, Cl, and Se2 -.
Referring to the periodic table, arrange (as much as possible) the atoms B, C, Al, and Si in order of increasing size.
Sample Exercise 7.2 
Predicting Relative Sizes of Atomic Radii
SOLUTION
Analyze and Plan We are given the chemical symbols for four ele-
ments and told to use their relative positions in the periodic table 
to predict the relative size of their atomic radii. We can use the two 
periodic trends described in the text to help with this problem.
Solve
B and C are in the same period, with C to the right of B. There-
fore, we expect the radius of C to be smaller than that of B 
because radii usually decrease as we move across a period.
