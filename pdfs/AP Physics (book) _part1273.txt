We often describe a sound wave in terms of the vibration of the molecules of
the medium in which it travels—that is, in terms of the motion or displacement 
of the molecules. Sound waves can also be analyzed from the point of view of
pressure. Indeed, longitudinal waves are often called pressure waves. The pressure
variation is usually easier to measure than the displacement. As Fig. 12–2 shows,
in a wave “compression” (where molecules are closest to
