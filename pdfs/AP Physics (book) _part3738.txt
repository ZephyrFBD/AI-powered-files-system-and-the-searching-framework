In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson pointed their horn antenna for
detecting radio waves (Fig. 33–23) into the sky. With it they detected widespread
emission, and became convinced that it was coming from outside our Galaxy.
They made precise measurements at a wavelength 
in the micro-
wave region of the electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 22–8). The intensity of this
radiation was found initially not to vary by day or night or time of year, nor to
depend on direction. It came from all directions in the universe with equal
intensity, to a precision of better than 1%. It could only be concluded that this
radiation came from the universe as a whole.
