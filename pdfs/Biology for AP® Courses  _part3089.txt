o treat severe epilepsy. While patients do suffer
some deficits following the surgery, they can have surprisingly few problems, especially when the surgery is performed on
children who have very immature nervous systems.

In other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy, the corpus callosum is cut instead of removing an entire hemisphere. This causes
a condition called split-brain, which gives insights into unique functions of the two hemispheres. For example, when an
object is presented to patientsâ€™ left visual field, they may be unable to verbally name the object (and may claim to not have
seen an object at all). This is because the visual input from the left visual field crosses and enters the right hemisphere and
cannot then signal to the speech center, which generally is found in the left side of the brain. Remarkably, if a split-brain
patient is asked to pick up a specific object
