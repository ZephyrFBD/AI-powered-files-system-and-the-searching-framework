resent the heat 
released in a combustion reaction, by convention fuel values are reported as positive 
numbers.
Give It Some Thought
Based on the enthalpy of the above reaction, what is the fuel value of glucose on a 
per gram basis?
Like carbohydrates, fats produce CO2 and H2O when metabolized. The reaction of 
tristearin, C57H110O6, a typical fat, is
2 C57H110O61s2 + 163 O21g2 ¡  
114 CO21g2 + 110 H2O1l2   
∆H° = -71,609 kJ
The body uses the chemical energy from foods to maintain body temperature (see 
the “Chemistry and Life” box in Section 5.5), to contract muscles, and to construct and 
repair tissues. Any excess energy is stored as fats. Fats are well suited to serve as the body’s 
energy reserve for at least two reasons: (1) They are insoluble in water, which facilitates 
storage in the body, and (2) they produce more energy per gram than either proteins or 
carbohydrates, which makes them efficient energy sources on a mass basis. The average 
fuel value of fats is 38 kJ>g 19 k
