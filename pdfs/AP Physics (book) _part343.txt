alicized (or boldface when shown as a vector).
Force to accelerate a fast car. Estimate the
net force needed to accelerate (a) a 1000-kg car at
(b) a 200-gram apple at
the same rate.
APPROACH We use Newton’s second law to find the net force needed for each
object; we are given the mass and the acceleration. This is an estimate (the
is
not said to be precise) so we round off to one significant figure.
SOLUTION (a) The car’s acceleration is
We
use Newton’s second law to get the net force needed to achieve this acceleration:
(If you are used to British units, to get an idea of what a 5000-N force is, you can
divide by 
and get a force of about 1000 lb.)
(b) For the apple,
so
Force to stop a car. What average net force is required to
bring a 1500-kg car to rest from a speed of 
within a distance of 55 m?
APPROACH We use Newton’s second law,
to determine the force,
but first we need to calculate the acceleration a. We assume the acceleration is
constant so that we can use the kinematic equa
