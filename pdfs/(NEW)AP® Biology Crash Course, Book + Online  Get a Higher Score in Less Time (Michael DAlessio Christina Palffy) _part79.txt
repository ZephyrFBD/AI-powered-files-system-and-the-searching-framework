 tall (T) plants are dominant to short plants (t). Green leaf (G) is dominant to
yellow leaf (g).
Cross two true breeding plants of tall green and short yellow
E. Using the Laws of Probability in Genetics
1. Probability (p)—the number of times an event is expected to occur divided by the number of
opportunities for the event to occur. A probability can be expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or a
decimal; for example:
i.
¼ = 0.25 = 25%
ii. ½ = 0.5 = 50%
iii. 1/1 = 1 = 100%
2. Law of Multiplication—used to calculate the probability of independent events occurring; therefore,
for genes that are linked the law of multiplication cannot be followed.
Example 1: Assume the following cross: AaBbCc x AabbCC. What are the chances of the following
progeny?
(a) AabbCC
(b) aabbCc
(c) AAbbCC
Answer: Perform each individual monohybrid cross and use the law of multiplication.
Aa x Aa = 1/2 Aa, 1/4 aa, 1/4 AA
Bb x bb = 1/2 Bb, 1/2 bb
Cc x CC = 1/2 Cc, 1/2 CC
(a) AabbCC = ½ x ½ x ½ = 1/8
(b) aabbCc =
