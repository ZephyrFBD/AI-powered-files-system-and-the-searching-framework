as the other gets 
larger. Boyle’s law can be expressed mathematically as
 
V = constant * 1
P or PV = constant 
[10.2]
The value of the constant depends on temperature and on the amount of gas in the sample.
The graph of V versus P in Figure 10.5 shows the curve obtained for a given quantity 
of gas at a fixed temperature. A linear relationship is obtained when V is plotted versus 
1>P as shown on the right in Figure 10.5.

 = 764.7 torr + 1136.4 torr - 103.8 torr2
 = 797.3 torr
 
We convert the pressure of the gas to atmospheres:
P
gas = 1797.3 torr2a 1 atm
760 torrb = 1.049 atm 
(b) To calculate the pressure in kPa, we employ the conversion  
factor between atmospheres and kPa:
