of the host).
10. C. The assembly of an HIV virus requires two copies of the viral RNA (with the reverse transcriptase enzyme),
viral proteins for the protein coat (capsid), and glycoproteins for the viral envelope. Viral mRNA is translated to
produce the proteins; some of those proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum, where they are modified into
glycoproteins. The glycoproteins are transported to the plasma membrane by vesicles, where they merge with the
virus as it leaves the cell.
11. B. The viral genes exist in the dsDNA generated in the cytoplasm. The dsDNA enters the nucleus and merges
with the host DNA, where it gets transcribed into mRNA along with the host DNA.
12. D. The RNA of RNA viruses is copied by an RNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase. Neither enzyme has a
proofreading function or the ability to repair copying errors. As a result, RNA viruses mutate much faster than DNA
viruses.
13. D. The outgroup species is chosen so that it is the most primitive of the taxa bei
