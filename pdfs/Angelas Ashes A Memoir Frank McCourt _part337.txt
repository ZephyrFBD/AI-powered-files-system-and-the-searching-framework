 say I wear my sister’s blouse there’s no use telling them I don’t have a 
 
 sister because they’ll say,You’d wear it if you had a sister.There’s no use 
 
 saying anything in the schoolyard because there’s always someone with

 and if you were to punch everyone who has an answer you’d be punching 
 
 morning noon and night. 
 
 Quigley takes the bit of peel from Fintan.Thanks, Fintan. 
 
 The whole class is looking at Clohessy because he’s the biggest and
