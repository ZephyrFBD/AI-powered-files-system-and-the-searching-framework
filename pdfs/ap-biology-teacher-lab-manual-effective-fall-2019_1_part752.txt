Supply Company, 1988.  
This is a useful manual that comes with each Drosophila culture order from Carolina.

Company). Excellent photographs help teachers and students identify different  
mutants and give guidance for sexing the flies.

sites, including the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project. It is a general database that 
could be used by teachers or students who would like to have more information about 
any particular mutant.
