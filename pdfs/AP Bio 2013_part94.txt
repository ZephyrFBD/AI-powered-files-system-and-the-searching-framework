 the second 
group, and 430 nm for the third group). The three light sources are of equal intensity, and all 
organisms are illuminated for equal lengths of time. Predict the relative rate of photosynthesis in 
each of the three groups. Justify your predictions. (5 points maximum)

650 nm  
(1st Group) 
Intermediate rate 
An intermediate level of absorption occurs at 650 nm 
(compared to 430 nm and 550 nm); therefore, an 
intermediate amount of energy is available to drive 
photosynthesis. 
550 nm 
(2nd Group) 
Lowest rate 
The lowest level of absorption occurs at 550 nm; therefore, 
the least amount of energy is available to drive 
photosynthesis.  
430 nm 
(3rd Group) 
Highest rate 
The highest level of absorption occurs at 430 nm; therefore, 
the greatest amount of energy is available to drive 
photosynthesis.
