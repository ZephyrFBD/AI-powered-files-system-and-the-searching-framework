cated. Interphase is followed by the mitotic phase. During the mitotic phase, the duplicated
chromosomes are segregated and distributed into daughter nuclei. The cytoplasm is usually divided as well, resulting
in two daughter cells.
Interphase
During interphase, the cell undergoes normal growth processes while also preparing for cell division. In order for a cell
to move from interphase into the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. The three stages of
interphase are called G1, S, and G2.
G1 Phase (First Gap)
The first stage of interphase is called the G1 phase (first gap) because, from a microscopic aspect, little change is visible.
However, during the G1 stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. The cell is accumulating the building blocks
of chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins as well as accumulating sufficient energy reserves to complete the task
of replicating each chromosome in the nucleus.
S Phase (Synthesis of DNA)
