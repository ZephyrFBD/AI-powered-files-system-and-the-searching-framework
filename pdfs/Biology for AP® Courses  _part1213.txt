hey have different outcomes. The main difference is in the type of
cell produced: mitosis produces identical cells, allowing growth or repair of tissues; meiosis generates reproductive cells, or
gametes. Gametes, often called sex cells, unite with other sex cells to produce new, unique organisms.
Genetic variation occurs during meiosis I, in which homologous chromosomes pair and exchange non-sister chromatid
segments (crossover). Here the homologous chromosomes separate into different nuclei, causing a reduction in “ploidy.”
During meiosis II—which is more similar to a mitotic division—the chromatids separate and segregate into four haploid sex
cells. However, because of crossover, the resultant daughter cells do not contain identical genomes. As in mitosis, external
factors and internal signals regulate the meiotic cell cycle. As we will explore in more detail in a later chapter, errors in
meiosis can cause genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome.
