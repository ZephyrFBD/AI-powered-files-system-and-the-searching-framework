 drink our tea while Alphie chews the last bit of bread covered with 
 
 sugar. He makes us laugh the way he smears the sugar all over his face 
 
 and grins at us with his fat sticky cheeks. But we can’t laugh too much 
 
 or Mam will jump out of the bed and order Malachy and me off to 
 
 school where we’ll be killed for being late.We don’t laugh long, there is

 no more bread and we’re hungry, the four of us.We can get no more

 at us all the time because Dad is from the North and he never sends 
 
 money home from England where he is working in a munitions factory. 
 
 Grandma says we could starve to death for all he cares.That would teach 
 
 Mam a lesson for marrying a man from the North with sallow skin, an 
 
 odd manner and a look of the Presbyterian about him. 
 
 Still, I’ll have to try Kathleen O’Connell once more. I’ll tell her my
