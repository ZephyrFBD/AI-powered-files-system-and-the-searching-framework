ng equation:
 
In this equation, r is the reproductive rate (or growth rate ), and N is the population size at the beginning of the
interval for which the births and deaths are counted. The numerator of the equation is the net increase in individuals.
If, for example, a population of size N = 1,000 had 60 births
and 10 deaths over a one-year period, then r would equal
 
, or 0.05 per year.
 
If both sides of the equation are multiplied by N, the equation can be expressed as follows:
 
The Greek letter delta (A) means “change in.” Thus,
 
 means the change in the number of individuals in a given time interval. The expression can also be written in
calculus terms, using
 
(Don’t let the calculus expression intimidate you; for our purposes, the two expressions are essentially the
same.)
 
Here the reproductive rate, rmax, is maximum and so represents the biotic
potential. It is called the intrinsic rate of growth. Note that when deaths exceed births, r will be negative, and the
population
