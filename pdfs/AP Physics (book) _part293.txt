Heading upstream. A boat’s speed in still water is
. If the boat is to travel north directly across a river whose westward current has 
speed
at what upstream angle must the boat head? (See Fig.3–29.)
APPROACH If the boat heads straight across the river, the current will drag 
the boat downstream (westward). To overcome the river’s current, the boat
must have an upstream (eastward) component of velocity as well as a cross-stream
(northward) component. Figure 3–29 has been drawn with 
the velocity of
the Boat relative to the Shore, pointing directly across the river because this is
where the boat is supposed to go. (Note that  
)
SOLUTION Vector 
points upstream at angle as shown. From the diagram,
Thus  
so the boat must head upstream at a 40.4° angle.
