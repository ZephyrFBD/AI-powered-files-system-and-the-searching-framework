example, platelets are cell fragments that circulate in the blood and contribute to the clotting mechanism. When
platelets encounter damaged tissue, they release platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which binds to the plasma
membrane of fibroblasts (a connective tissue) and stimulates its cell division. The new fibroblasts contribute to the
healing of damaged tissue. More than 50 different growth factors are known.
2. Density-dependent inhibition. Many cells stop dividing when the surrounding cell density reaches a certain
maximum.
3. Anchorage dependence. Most cells only divide when they are attached to an external surface, such as the flat
surface of a neighboring cell (or the side of a culture dish).
Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and division. Transformed cells, cells that have become
cancerous, proliferate without regard to cell cycle checkpoints, density-dependent inhibition, anchorage dependence,
and other regulatory mechanisms. Thus, cancer is a disease o
