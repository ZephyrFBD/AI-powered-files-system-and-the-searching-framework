ng duct to water. As a result, urine
becomes more concentrated as water diffuses out of the collecting duct as the filtrate descends into the renal pelvis.
ADH is secreted by the posterior pituitary of the hypothalamus in response to elevated osmolarity (solute
concentration) in the blood.
2. Aldosterone increases both the reabsorption of water and the
reabsorption of Na+. It does this by increasing the active transport of
 
Na+ in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. As a result,
 
more Na+ is reabsorbed out of this tubule and duct. Since the Na+
 
increases the salt concentration outside the tubule, water passively follows.
 
Nitrogen forms a major waste product in animals. When amino acids and
 
nucleic acids are broken down, they release toxic ammonia (NH3). To rid
 
the body of this toxin, several mechanisms have evolved, each appropriate to the habitat or survival of the animal.
 
1. Aquatic animals excrete NH3 (or NH4+) directly into the surrounding
 
water.
