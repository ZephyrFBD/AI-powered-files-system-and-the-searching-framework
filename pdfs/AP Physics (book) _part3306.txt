pied energy band (the valence band) is completely
full, and there is a large energy gap (5 to 10 eV) to the next highest
band, the conduction band. At room temperature, molecular
kinetic energy (thermal energy) available due to collisions is only
about 0.04 eV, so almost no electrons can jump from the valence
to the conduction band in an insulator. In a semiconductor, the
gap between valence and conduction bands is much smaller,
on the order of 1 eV, so a few electrons can make the transition
from the essentially full valence band to the nearly empty
conduction band, allowing a small amount of conductivity.
In a doped semiconductor, a small percentage of impurity
atoms with five or three valence electrons replace a few of the
normal silicon atoms with their four valence electrons. A five-
electron impurity produces an n-type semiconductor with
negative electrons as carriers of current. A three-electron
impurity produces a p-type semiconductor in which positive
holes carry the current.
