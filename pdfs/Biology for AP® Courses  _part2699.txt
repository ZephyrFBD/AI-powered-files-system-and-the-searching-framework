ow that as light passes through a plant stem, it is diffracted and generates
phototropin activation across the stem. Most activation occurs on the lit side, causing the plant hormone indole acetic acid
(IAA) to accumulate on the shaded side. Stem cells elongate under influence of IAA.
Cryptochromes are another class of blue-light absorbing photoreceptors that also contain a flavin-based chromophore.
Cryptochromes set the plants 24-hour activity cycle, also know as its circadian rhythem, using blue light cues. There is some
evidence that cryptochromes work together with phototropins to mediate the phototropic response.

If green light was used rather than white light to irradiate a sunflower seedling, what would happen?
a.
Green light is absorbed by the plant. The seedling would not bend, but it would grow tall and spindly as if
grown in the dark.
