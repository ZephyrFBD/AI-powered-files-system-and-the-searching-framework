ds to one antinode
(or loop). And as can be seen in Fig. 11–41b, the whole length corresponds to
one-half wavelength. Thus
where 
stands for the wavelength of the
fundamental frequency. The other natural frequencies are called overtones; for a
vibrating string they are whole-number (integral) multiples of the fundamental,
and then are also called harmonics, with the fundamental being referred to as the
first harmonic.† The next mode of vibration after the fundamental has two loops
and is called the second harmonic (or first overtone), Fig. 11–41b. The length of
the string 
at the second harmonic corresponds to one complete wavelength:
For the third and fourth harmonics,

tively, and so on. In general, we can write
The integer n labels the number of the harmonic:
for the fundamental,
for the second harmonic, and so on. We solve for 
and find

To find the frequency f of each vibration we use Eq. 11–12,
and see that
