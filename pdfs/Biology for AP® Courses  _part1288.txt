l reported the results of his crosses involving seven different characteristics, each with two
contrasting traits. A trait is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic. The characteristics
included plant height, seed texture, seed color, flower color, pea pod size, pea pod color, and flower position. For the
characteristic of flower color, for example, the two contrasting traits were white versus violet. To fully examine each
characteristic, Mendel generated large numbers of F1 and F2 plants, reporting results from 19,959 F2 plants alone. His
findings were consistent.
What results did Mendel find in his crosses for flower color? First, Mendel confirmed that he had plants that bred true for
white or violet flower color. Regardless of how many generations Mendel examined, all self-crossed offspring of parents
with white flowers had white flowers, and all self-crossed offspring of parents with violet flowers had violet flowers. In
addition, Mendel con
