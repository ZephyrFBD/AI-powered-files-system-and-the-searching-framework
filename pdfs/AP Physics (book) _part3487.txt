 amount of X-ray or 
radiation that deposits
of energy per kilogram of air. The roentgen was largely super-
seded by another unit of absorbed dose applicable to any type of radiation, the
rad: 1 rad is that amount of radiation which deposits energy per unit mass of
in any absorbing material. (This is quite close to the roentgen
for X- and rays.) The proper SI unit for absorbed dose is the gray (Gy):
(31;9)
The absorbed dose depends not only on the energy per particle and on the strength
of a given source or of a radiation beam (number of particles per second), but
also on the type of material that is absorbing the radiation. Bone, for example,
absorbs more of X-ray or 
radiation normally used than does flesh, so the same
beam passing through a human body deposits a greater dose (in rads or grays) in
bone than in flesh.
The gray and the rad are physical units of doseâ€”the energy deposited per
unit mass of material. They are, however, not the most meaningful units for
measuring the biolog
