ounted along the same
axis. A power supply controls the flow of current in the first
coil, and thus the magnetic field it produces. The second coil
is connected only to an ammeter. The ammeter will indicate
that a current is flowing in the second coil
(a) whenever a current flows in the first coil.
(b) only when a steady current flows in the first coil.
(c) only when the current in the first coil changes.
(d) only if the second coil is connected to the power supply
by rewiring it to be in series with the first coil.
9. When a generator is used to produce electric current, the
resulting electric energy originates from which source?
(a) The generator’s magnetic field.
(b) Whatever rotates the generator’s axle.
(c) The resistance of the generator’s coil.
(d) Back emf.
(e) Empty space.
10. Which of the following will not increase a generator’s volt-
age output?
(a) Rotating the generator faster.
(b) Increasing the area of the coil.
(c) Rotating the magnetic field so that it is more closely
