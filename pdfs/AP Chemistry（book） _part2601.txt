neutral by identifying the ions in solution and by assessing 
how each ion will affect the pH.
Solve
(a) This solution contains barium ions and acetate ions. The 
cation is an ion of a heavy alkaline earth metal and will 
therefore not affect the pH. The anion, CH3COO-, is the con-
jugate base of the weak acid CH3COOH and will hydrolyze to 
produce OH - ions, thereby making the solution basic.
(b) In this solution, NH4
+ is the conjugate acid of a weak base 
1NH32 and is therefore acidic. Cl- is the conjugate base of a 
strong acid (HCl) and therefore has no inï¬‚uence on the pH 
Predict whether the salt Na2HPO4 forms an acidic solution or a basic solution when dissolved in water.

Predicting Whether the Solution of an Amphiprotic Anion Is Acidic or Basic
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to predict whether a solution of Na2HPO4 is 
acidic or basic. This substance is an ionic compound composed of 
Na+ and HPO4
2- ions.
Plan We need to evaluate each ion, predicting wheth
