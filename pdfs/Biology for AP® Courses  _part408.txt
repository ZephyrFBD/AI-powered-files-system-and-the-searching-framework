Section Summary
A cell is the smallest unit of life. Most cells are so tiny that they cannot be seen with the naked eye. Therefore, scientists
use microscopes to study cells. Electron microscopes provide higher magnification, higher resolution, and more detail than
light microscopes. The unified cell theory states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, the cell is the basic
unit of life, and new cells arise from existing cells.
4.2 | Prokaryotic Cells
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are the major structures of prokaryotic cells?
•
What limits the size of a cell?
Connection for AP® Courses
According to the cell theory, all living organisms, from bacteria to humans, are composed of cells, the smallest units of
living matter. Often too small to be seen without a microscope, cells come in all sizes and shapes, and their small size allows
for a large surface area-to-v
