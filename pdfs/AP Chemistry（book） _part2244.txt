Equation 14.23 provides a convenient way to calculate a rate constant k1 at some tem-
perature T
1 when we know the activation energy and the rate constant k2 at some other 
temperature T
2.
The table at right shows the rate constants for the rearrangement of methyl 
isonitrile at various temperatures (these are the data points in Figure 14.13):
(a) From these data, calculate the activation energy for the reaction.  
(b) What is the value of the rate constant at 430.0 K?
Sample Exercise 14.11
 Determining the Activation Energy
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given rate constants, k, measured at several tem-
peratures and asked to determine the activation energy, Ea, and 
the rate constant, k, at a particular temperature.
Plan We can obtain Ea from the slope of a graph of ln k versus 1>T
