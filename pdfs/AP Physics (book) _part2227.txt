 a long coil of wire with many loops or turns, Fig. 20–32. Each
loop produces a magnetic field as was shown in Fig. 20–9, and the total field
inside the solenoid will be the sum of the fields due to each current loop as shown
in Fig. 20–32a for a few loops. If the solenoid has many loops and they are close
together, the field inside will be nearly uniform and parallel to the solenoid axis
except at the ends, as shown in Fig. 20–32b. Outside the solenoid, the field lines
spread out in space, so the magnetic field is much weaker than inside. For apply-
ing Ampère’s law, we choose the path abcd shown in Fig. 20–33 far from either
end. We consider this path as made up of four straight segments, the sides of the
rectangle: ab, bc, cd, da. Then Ampère’s law, Eq. 20–9, becomes
The first term in the sum on the left will be (nearly) zero because the 
field outside the solenoid is negligible compared to the field inside. Furthermore,
is perpendicular to the segments bc and da, so these terms are
