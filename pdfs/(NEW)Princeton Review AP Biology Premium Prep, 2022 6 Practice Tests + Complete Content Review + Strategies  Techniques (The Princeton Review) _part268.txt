erphase (inter- means between)
because the cell has not yet started to divide. Although biologists sometimes refer to interphase as the “resting
stage,” the cell is definitely not inactive. During this phase, the cell carries out its regular activities. All the proteins
and enzymes it needs to grow are produced during interphase.
The Three Stages of Interphase
Interphase can be divided into three stages: G1, S, G2.
Sometimes certain cells can enter a stage called G0 during which it is in a non-
dividing state.
The most important phase is the S phase. That’s when the cell replicates its genetic material. The first thing a cell
has to do before undergoing mitosis is to duplicate all of its chromosomes, which contain the organism’s DNA
“blueprint.” During interphase, every single chromosome in the nucleus is duplicated.
You’ll notice that the original chromosome and its duplicate are still linked, like conjoined twins. These identical
strands of DNA are now called sister chromatids. The c
