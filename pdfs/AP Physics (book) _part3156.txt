phenomena as well. (See also note at end of this Section.)
Let us now look at the structure of some of the simpler atoms when they are
in the ground state. After hydrogen, the next simplest atom is helium with two
electrons. Both electrons can have
because one can have spin up 
and the other spin down 
thus satisfying the exclusion principle.
Since 
then and 
must be zero (Table 28–1, page 813). Thus the two
electrons have the quantum numbers indicated at the top of Table 28–2.
Lithium has three electrons, two of which can have 
But the third
cannot have 
without violating the exclusion principle. Hence the third
electron must have 
It happens that the 
level has a lower
energy than 
So the electrons in the ground state have the quantum
numbers indicated in Table 28–2. The quantum numbers of the third electron
could also be, say,
But the atom in this case would
be in an excited state, because it would have greater energy. It would not be long
before it jumped to the ground state with t
