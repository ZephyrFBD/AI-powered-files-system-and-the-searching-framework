Kb for NH3. We suggest 
you try this approach to convince yourself that you can use the  
Henderson–Hasselbalch equation for buffers for which you are given 
Kb for the conjugate base rather than Ka for the conjugate acid.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Calculate the number of grams of ammonium chloride that 
must be added to 2.00 L of a 0.500 M ammonia solution to 
obtain a buffer of pH = 9.20. Assume the volume of the 
solution does not change as the solid is added. Kb for ammo-
nia is 1.80 * 10-5.
(a) 60.7 g (b) 30.4 g (c) 1.52 g (d) 0.568 g  
(e) 1.59 * 10-5 g
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Calculate the concentration of sodium benzoate that must 
be present in a 0.20 M solution of benzoic acid 1C6H5COOH2 
to produce a pH of 4.00. Refer to Appendix D.
Give It Some Thought
The Ka values for nitrous acid 1HNO22 and hypochlorous (HClO) acid are 4.5 * 10-4 
and 3.0 * 10-8, respectively. Which one would be more suitable for use in a 
solution buffered at pH = 7.0? What other substances would be needed
