t on a nucleotide.
One of the four nitrogenous bases is present in each nucleotide.
— Adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine (in DNA)
— Adenine, uracil, cytosine, and guanine (in RNA)
ii. Nucleic acids have ends, defined by the 3’ and 5’ carbons of the nucleotide’s sugar. The direction
in which other nucleotides are added to the chain during DNA synthesis and the direction in which
transcription occurs are both determined by the placement of these two nucleotide ends.
