4.2 Aqueous solutions of three different substances, AX, AY, and 
AZ, are represented by the three accompanying diagrams. 
Identify each substance as a strong electrolyte, a weak elec-

rules. The oxidation of an element results in an increase in its oxi-
dation number, whereas reduction is accompanied by a decrease in 
oxidation number. Oxidation is always accompanied by reduction, 
giving oxidation-reduction, or redox, reactions.
Many metals are oxidized by O2, acids, and salts. The redox re-
actions between metals and acids as well as those between metals 
and salts are called displacement reactions. The products of these dis-
placement reactions are always an element 1H2 or a metal) and a salt. 
Comparing such reactions allows
