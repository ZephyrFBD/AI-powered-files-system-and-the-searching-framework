c material between non-sister chromatids resulting in chromosomes that incorporate genes
from both parents of the organism
life-cycle type in which the multicellular diploid stage is prevalent
union of two haploid cells from two individual organisms
a multicellular haploid life-cycle stage that produces gametes
specialized cell line that produces gametes, such as eggs or sperm
life-cycle type in which the multicellular haploid stage is prevalent
(also, interphase II) brief period of rest between meiosis I and meiosis II
the sequence of events in the development of an organism and the production of cells that produce offspring
a nuclear division process that results in four haploid cells
first round of meiotic cell division; referred to as reduction division because the ploidy level is reduced from
diploid to haploid
second round of meiotic cell division following meiosis I; sister chromatids are separated into individual
chromosomes, and the result is four unique haploid cells
