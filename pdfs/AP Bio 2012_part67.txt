iption factor 
known as Cubitus interruptus (Ci). When Hedgehog is present, it binds to Ptc, which prevents the inhibition of 
Smo by Ptc. The result is that Ci remains intact and can enter the nucleus, where it binds to and activates certain 
genes. 
 
 
 
  One approach to treating patients with pancreatic cancer and other cancers in which the Hedgehog protein is 
detected is to modify the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Which of the following is the most useful approach? 
(A) Treating patients with a molecule that is structurally similar to Hedgehog and that will bind to and interact 
with Ptc in the same fashion as Hedgehog 
(B) Injecting patients with embryonic cells so that Hedgehog will bind to those cells instead of the cancer cells 
(C) Treating patients with a membrane-soluble compound that can bind to Smo and block its activity 
(D) Injecting patients with a preparation of purified membrane-soluble Ci that will enter the nuclei of the cancer 
cells and induce gene transcription
