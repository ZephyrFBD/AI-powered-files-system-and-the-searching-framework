 to recover
from damage caused by various phenomena.
d.
Because compounds produced to kill insects also
influence the behavior and growth of tropical
plants.
36. Explain how the increase in human population and
resource use causes increased extinction rates by altering
ecosystems.
a.
Human population growth leads to unsustainable
resource use, habitat destruction, and the
unsustainable fishing and hunting of wild animal
populations. All these incidences results in a
slow evolutionary rate of formation of new
species.
b.
Human population growth leads to unsustainable
resource use, habitat destruction, and the
unsustainable fishing and hunting of wild animal
populations. Climate change also occurs due to
excessive use of fossil fuels.
c.
Human population growth leads to unsustainable
resource use, habitat destruction, and
unsustainable fishing and hunting of wild animal
populations. Excessive use of fossil fuels is
leading to reduced populations of fish species.
d.
Human population growt
