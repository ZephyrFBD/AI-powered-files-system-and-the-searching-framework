photon with a wavelength 
of 549 nm, while GaAs has a band gap 
of 1.43 eV 12.29 * 10-19 J2, which cor-
responds to an infrared photon with 
a wavelength of 867 nm. 
 (Sec-
tions 6.1 and 6.2) By forming solid 
solutions of these two compounds, 
with stoichiometries of GaP1 - xAsx, 
the band gap can be adjusted to any 
intermediate value. Thus, GaP1 - xAsx 
is the solid solution of choice for red, 
orange, and yellow LEDs. Green LEDs 
are made from mixtures of GaP and 
AlP 1Eg = 2.43 eV, l = 510 nm2.
Red LEDs have been in the market 
for decades, but to make white light, 
an efficient blue LED was needed. The 
first prototype bright blue LED was 
demonstrated in a Japanese laboratory 
in 1993. In 2010, less than 20 years 
later, over $10 billion worth of blue 
LEDs were sold worldwide. The blue 
LEDs are based on combinations of 
GaN 1Eg = 3.4 eV, l = 365 nm2 and 
InN 1Eg = 2.4 eV, l = 517 nm2. Many 
colors of LEDs are now available and 
are used in everything from barcode
