ormal reaction conditions H2 and O2 react to form water, H2O 
(rather than hydrogen peroxide H2O2), regardless of the starting ra-
tio of hydrogen to oxygen.
Suppose you are given a bottle of sulfur, which is a yellow solid, 
a cylinder of O2, a transparent reaction vessel that can be evacu-
ated and sealed so that only sulfur, oxygen, and the product(s) of 
the reaction between the two are present, an analytical balance so 
that you can determine the masses of the reactants and/or products, 
and a furnace that can be used to heat the reaction vessel to 200 Â°C 
where the two elements react. (a) If you start with 0.10 mol of sulfur 
in the reaction vessel how many moles of oxygen would need to be 
added to form SO2, assuming SO2 forms  
exclusively? (b) How many 
moles of oxygen would be needed to form SO3, assuming SO3 forms 
exclusively? (c) Given the available equipment, how would you de-
termine you had added the correct number of moles of each reac-
tant to the reaction vessel? (d)
