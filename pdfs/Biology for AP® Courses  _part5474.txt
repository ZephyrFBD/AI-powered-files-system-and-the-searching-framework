Co2 levels in Earth’s atmosphere had reduced by 90 percent. Moore
said that by the time humanity began to unlock carbon dioxide from
fossil fuels we were at ‘38 seconds to midnight’ and in that sense:
‘Humans are [the Earth’s] salvation.’ Moore made the point that only
half the Co2 emiĴed by fossil fuels stays in the atmosphere and we
should remember that all pollution pouring from chimneys that we
are told is carbon dioxide is in fact nothing of the kind. It’s pollution.
Carbon dioxide is an invisible gas.
William Happer, Professor of Physics at Princeton University and
long-time government adviser on climate, has emphasised the Co2
deﬁciency for maximum growth and food production. Greenhouse
growers don’t add carbon dioxide for a bit of fun. He said that most
of the warming in the last 100 years, aĞer the earth emerged from
the super-cold period of the ‘LiĴle Ice Age’ into a natural warming
cycle, was over by 1940. Happer said that a peak year for warming in
1988 can be exp
