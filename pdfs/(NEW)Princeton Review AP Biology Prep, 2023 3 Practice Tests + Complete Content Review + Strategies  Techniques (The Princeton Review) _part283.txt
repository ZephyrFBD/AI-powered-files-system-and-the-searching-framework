(A) Sperm, neuron, liver
(B) Ovum, muscle, taste bud
(C) Liver, heart, intestine
(D) Skin, neuron, ovum
6. Which of the following mutations would be LEAST likely to have any discernible phenotype on the

Summary
Sometimes cells do not need to pass any molecules through the membrane, but instead they just pass a message.
This is signal transduction. A ligand binds to a receptor on the outside of the cell and causes changes to the
