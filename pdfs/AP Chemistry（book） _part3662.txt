state of the metal, which is +3 for the complexes in Table 23.3. The secondary valence is 
the number of atoms bonded to the metal ion, which is also called the coordination 
number. For these cobalt complexes, Werner deduced a coordination number of 6 with 
the ligands in an octahedral arrangement around the Co3+ ion.
Werner’s theory provided a beautiful explanation for the results in Table 23.3. The 
NH3 molecules are ligands bonded to the Co3+ ion (through the nitrogen atom as we will 
see later); if there are fewer than six NH3 molecules, the remai
