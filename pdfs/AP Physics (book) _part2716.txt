ht passes through the liquid crystal. The light emerges
with its plane of polarization rotated by 90°, and readily passes through the second
polarizer, Fig. 24–51a. A tiny LCD pixel in this situation will appear bright.
*
Now suppose a voltage is applied to transparent electrodes on each glass
plate of the pixel. The rod-like molecules are polar (or can acquire an internal
separation of charge due to the applied electric field). The applied voltage tends
to align the molecules end-to-end, and they no longer follow the careful twisted
pattern shown in Fig. 24–51a. Instead the applied electric field tends to align the
molecules end-to-end, left to right (perpendicular to the glass plates), Fig. 24–51b,
and then they don’t affect the light polarization significantly. The entering plane-
polarized light no longer has its plane of polarization rotated as it passes through
the liquid crystal, and no light can exit through the second (horizontal) polarizer
(Fig. 24–51b). With the voltage on,
