egin by counting each kind of atom on the two sides of the arrow. 
There are one Na, one O, and two H on the left side, and one Na, one 
O, and three H on the right. The Na and O atoms are balanced, but 
the number of H atoms is not. To increase the number of H atoms on 
the left, let’s try placing the coefficient 2 in front of H2O:
Na1s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡  NaOH1aq2 + H21g2
We now have two Na atoms, four H atoms, and two O atoms on 
each side. The equation is balanced.
Comment Notice that we moved back and forth, placing a  
coefficient in front of H2O, then NaOH, and finally Na. In balanc-
ing equations, we often find ourselves following this pattern of 
moving back and forth from one side of the arrow to the other, 
placing coefficients first in front of a formula on one side and 
then in front of a formula on the other side until the equation is 
balanced. You can always tell if you have balanced your equation 
correctly by checking that the number of atoms of each element 
is the same o
