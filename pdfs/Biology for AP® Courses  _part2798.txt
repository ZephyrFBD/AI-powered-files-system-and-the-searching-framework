show a similar disease progression and transferability of
resistance (Weller, Ann. Rev. Plant Phytopath, 26, 1988).
A. Plants, like animals, have immune defenses that may
involve cooperative interactions between organisms.
Describe a model of immune response that accounts for
these behaviors.
In plants, the first line of defense is the cell wall. Animal
cells lack this protective barrier. Adaptive immunity of
vertebrates to pathogens uses specific defenses that are
transportable within the organism, such as T-cells, and
retains information about earlier infections, such as T-cell
receptors. Unlike adaptive immunity, the innate responses
of plants are much less effective in defending against
necrotrophic (colonizing dead tissue) than against
biotrophic (infecting living tissue) pathogens. In animal
