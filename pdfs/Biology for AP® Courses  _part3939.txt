ogens are taken up by M cells in the intestinal
epithelium and excreted into a pocket formed by the inner surface of the cell. The pocket contains antigen-presenting
cells such as dendritic cells, which engulf the antigens, then present them with MHC II molecules on the cell surface.
The dendritic cells migrate to an underlying tissue called a Peyer’s patch. Antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and B cells
aggregate within the Peyer’s patch, forming organized lymphoid follicles. There, some T cells and B cells are activated.
Other antigen-loaded dendritic cells migrate through the lymphatic system where they activate B cells, T cells, and
plasma cells in the lymph nodes. The activated cells then return to MALT tissue effector sites. IgA and other antibodies
are secreted into the intestinal lumen.
MALT is a crucial component of a functional immune system because mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal passages, are the
first tissues onto which inhaled or ingested pathogens are deposited. The
