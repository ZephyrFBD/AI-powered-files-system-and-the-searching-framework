▲ Figure 7.2 An analogy for effective 
nuclear charge. We envision the nucleus as 
a light bulb, the core electrons as a frosted 
glass lampshade, and a valence electron as 
an observer. The amount of light seen by 
the observer depends on the intensity of the 
light bulb and the screening by the frosted 
glass lampshade.
Valence electron (3s)
Ten core electrons (1s22s22p6)
screen the nucleus from the
valence electron (102).
Sodium nucleus contains
11 protons (111). 
▶ Figure 7.3 Effective nuclear charge. The 
effective nuclear charge experienced by the 
3s electron in a sodium atom depends on 
the 11+ charge of the nucleus and the 10- 
charge of the core electrons.

probability that the 3s electron is close to the nucleus, the value of S in Equation 7.1 
changes from 10 to 8.5.
The notion of effective nuclear charge also explains an important effect we noted 
in Section 6.7: For a many-elec
