population.
The three types of variation that can occur in a population are stabilizing
selection, directional selection, and disruptive (diversifying) selection. If a
population is subject to stabilizing selection, extremes at both ends of a
phenotype are eliminated, resulting in less genetic variability. For
example, if the variation in color of a bird species ranges from dark gray
to white and the population is subject to stabilizing selection, the
medium-gray phenotype will be most common. If the population is under
directional selection, one extreme is preferentially selected against the
other (e.g., white birds being more easily spotted by predators leading to
the selection of dark gray), so that the average in the population moves in
one direction. Disruptive (diversifying) selection favors both extremes
while selecting against the average, which would mean dark gray and
white are selected over medium-gray in the case of the birds.
