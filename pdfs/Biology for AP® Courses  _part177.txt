cause the electrons will be equally distributed between the two
oxygen atoms.
Another example of a nonpolar covalent bond is methane (CH4), also shown in this figure. Carbon has four electrons in its
outermost shell and needs four more to fill it. It gets these four from four hydrogen atoms, each atom providing one, making
a stable outer shell of eight electrons. Carbon and hydrogen do not have the same electronegativity but are similar; thus,

nonpolar bonds form. The hydrogen atoms each need one electron for their outermost shell, which is filled when it contains
two electrons. These elements share the electrons equally among the carbons and the hydrogen atoms, creating a nonpolar
covalent molecule.
Figure 2.12 Whether a molecule is polar or nonpolar depends both on bond type and molecular shape. Both water and
carbon dioxide have polar covalent bonds, but car
