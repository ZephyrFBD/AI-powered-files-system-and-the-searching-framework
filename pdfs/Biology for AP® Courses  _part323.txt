positive nitrogen atom in the amino group and the partially negative oxygen atom in the carbonyl group of the peptide
backbone. The α-helix and β-pleated sheet structures are found in most globular and fibrous proteins and they play an
important structural role.
Tertiary Structure
The unique three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is its tertiary structure (Figure 3.31). This structure is in part
due to chemical interactions at work on the polypeptide chain. Primarily, the interactions among R groups creates the

complex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein. The nature of the R groups found in the amino acids involved
can counteract the formation of the hydrogen bonds described for standard secondary structures. For example, R groups
with like charges are repelled by each other and those with unlike charges are attracted to each other (ionic bonds). When
protein folding takes place, the hydrophobic R groups of
