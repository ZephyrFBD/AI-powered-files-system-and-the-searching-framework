 or
through the air, so choice (D) is incorrect.
22. (C) Quorum sensing in bacteria affects nearby bacteria cells and is an example of paracrine signaling. Choice
(A) is incorrect because synaptic signaling is specific to neurons that secrete neurochemicals across a synaptic
gap. Cytokine signaling occurs between cells that are in direct contact, so choice (B) is incorrect. Endocrine
signaling occurs over long distances, whereas quorum sensing occurs over short distances, so choice (D) is
incorrect.
23. (C) Steroid hormones can cross the cell membrane unassisted and bind to receptors in the cellâ€™s cytoplasm. G-
protein-linked receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors, and membrane ion channel receptors are all types of
membrane-bound receptors, which bind to hydrophilic ligands, so choices (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect.
24. (D) Cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the calcium ion are both secondary messengers. Choices (A) and (C) are
incorrect because cAMP and the calcium ion do not function as receptor
