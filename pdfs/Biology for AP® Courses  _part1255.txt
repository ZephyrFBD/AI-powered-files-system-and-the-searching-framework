cellular organism on Earth employs sexual reproduction is strong evidence for
the benefits of producing offspring with unique gene combinations, though there are other possible benefits as well.
Think About It
Compare and contrast the three main types of life cycles in multicellular organisms and give an example of
an organism that employs each.
