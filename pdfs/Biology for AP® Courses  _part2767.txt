84. Scientists on a new project to restore a damaged salt
marsh are investigating several plants that could be
introduced. Plant X is considered a possible candidate.
Before the decision is made, the following data are
examined. Assume that the contribution of gravity and
matric potential are negligible and can be ignored. Recall
that the overall water potential for a system is represented
by the equation: Ψsystem = Ψtotal = Ψs + Ψp + Ψg + Ψm
overall Ψ of the soil: -2.1MPa solute potential of the
plant’s cell contents: -0.12MPa pressure potential (Ψp) of
the plant’s cells: -2.3 MPa
Is Plant X a good candidate for introduction to the salt
marsh?
a.
Yes, because the overall water potential of the
plant is less negative than the water potential of
the soil.
b.
No, because the overall water potential of the
plant is less negative than the water potential of
the soil.
