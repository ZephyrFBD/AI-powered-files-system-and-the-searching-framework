ducts in redox reactions. Unless H+, OH-, or H2O is 
being oxidized or reduced, these species do not appear in the skeleton equation. Their 
presence, however, can be deduced as we balance the equation.
How to Balance Redox Reactions in Acidic Aqueous Solution
 
1. Divide the equation into one oxidation half-reaction and one reduction half-reaction.
 
2. Balance each half-reaction.
(a) First, balance elements other than H and O.
(b) Next, balance O atoms by adding H2O as needed.
(c) Then balance H atoms by adding H+ as needed.
(d) Finally, balance charge by adding e- as needed.
This speciﬁc sequence 1a2-1d2 is important, and it is summarized in the diagram in 
the margin. At this point, you can check whether the number of electrons in each 
half-reaction corresponds to the changes in oxidation state.
