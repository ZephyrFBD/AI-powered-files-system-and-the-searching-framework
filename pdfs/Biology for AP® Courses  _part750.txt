les, whereas in anabolic reactions this
free energy is utilized by simpler compounds to
make only proteins and nucleic acids.
30. Does physical exercise involve anabolic processes,
catabolic processes, or both? Give evidence for your
answer.
a.
Physical exercise involves both catabolic and
anabolic processes. Glucose is broken down into
simpler compounds during physical activity. The
simpler compounds are then used to provide
energy to the muscles for contraction by the
anabolic pathway.
b.
Physical exercise is just a catabolic process.
Glucose is broken down into simpler compounds
during physical activity and the simpler
compounds are then used to provide energy to
the muscles for contraction.
c.
Physical activity involves only anabolic
processes. Glucose is broken down into simpler
compounds during physical activity and the
simpler compounds are then used to provide
energy to the muscles for contraction by
anabolic pathways.
d.
Physical exercise involves both anabolic and
catabolic p
