iosis is a cell division 
resulting in the halving, or reduction, of chromosome number in each cell. A diploid 
organism has two sets of chromosomes (2n), while a haploid cell or organism has one 
set (1n). Meiosis produces gametes (ova and sperm) in animals and spores in fungi, 
plants, and protists. Three other important characteristics of meiosis are the exchange of 
genetic material (“crossing over”) between homologous chromosomes, the independent 
assortment of the chromosomes, and the separation of alleles of the same gene (Figure 
6). These characteristics, along with random fertilization, increase the genetic variability 
in the offspring. These mechanisms are essential to our understanding of genetics and 
evolution in sexually reproducing organisms. 
The hallmark of sexual reproduction is the great diversity seen in the gametes and 
in the resulting offspring produced by fertilization. Meiosis is integral to this process 
because this type of cell division produces the sex ce
