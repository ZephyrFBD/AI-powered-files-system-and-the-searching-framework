n’s molar mass. The 
solution contained 3.50 mg of protein dissolved in sufficient water to form 5.00 mL of solution. The osmotic pressure of the 
solution at 25 °C was found to be 1.54 torr. Treating the protein as a nonelectrolyte, calculate its molar mass.
use Equation 13.14 to calculate the molarity of the solution, M. 
In doing so, we must convert temperature from °C to K and the 
osmotic pressure from torr to atm. We then use the molarity 
and the volume of the solution 15.00 mL2 to determine the 
number of moles of solute. Finally, we obtain the molar mass 
by dividing the mass of the solute 13.50 mg2 by the number of 
moles of solute.

 Solving Equation 13.14 for molarity gives:

Because the volume of the solution is 5.00 mL = 5.00 * 10-3 L, 
the number of moles of protein must be:
Moles = 18.28 * 10-5 mol>L215.00 * 10-3 L2 = 4.14 * 10-7 mol
The molar mass is the number of g
