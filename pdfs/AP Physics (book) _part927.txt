4. Torque equation. Let us calculate the torque about an axis through the board
at the pivot point, P
. Then the lever arms for 
and for the weight of the
board are zero, and they will contribute zero torque about point P. Thus the
torque equation will involve only the forces 
and 
which are equal to
the weights of the children. The torque exerted by each child will be mg times
the appropriate lever arm, which here is the distance of each child from the
pivot point.
tends to rotate the board counterclockwise 
and 
clockwise 
, so the torque equation is
or
where two terms were dropped because their lever arms were zero.
5. Solve. We solve the torque equation for x and find
To balance the seesaw, child B must sit so that her CG is 3.0 m from the pivot
point. This makes sense: since she is lighter, she must
