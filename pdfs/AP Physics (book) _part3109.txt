-to-
mass ratio of the electron (Section 27–1); (b) measured
the charge on the electron and showed that it is quantized
(Section 27–1); (c) proposed the radical assumption that
the vibrational energy of molecules in a radiating object is
quantized (Sections 27–2, 27–3); (d) found that light 
(X-rays) scattered off electrons in a material will decrease
the energy of the photons (Section 27–5); (e) proposed
that the wavelength of a material particle would be related
to its momentum in the same way as for a photon 
(Section 27–8); (f) performed the first crucial experiment
illustrating electron diffraction (Section 27–8); (g) deciphered
the nuclear model of the atom by aiming 
particles at 
gold foil (Section 27–10).
2. State the principle of complementarity, and give at least two
experimental results that support this principle for electrons
and for photons. (See Section 27–7 and also Sections 27–3
and 27–8.)
3. Imagine the following Young’s double-slit experiment
using matter rather tha
