because the temperature decreases during the phase transi-
tion. (c) No, because the entropy change depends on the sign 
of the heat transferred to or from the system. (d) No, because 
the heat transferred to the system has a positive sign.  
(e) More than one of the previous answers is correct.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
The normal boiling point of ethanol, C2H5OH, is 78.3 °C, 
and its molar enthalpy of vaporization is 38.56 kJ>mol. 
What is the change in entropy in the system when 68.3 g of 
C2H5OH1g2 at 1 atm condenses to liquid at the normal boil-
ing point?
q = 150.0 g Hg2a
1 mol Hg
200.59 g Hgb a -2.29 kJ
1 mol Hgb a 1000 J
1 kJ b = -571 J
-38.9 °C = 1-38.9 + 273.152 K = 234.3 K
SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 19.2 
Calculating ∆S for a Phase Change
Before using Equation 19.2, we must first convert the given 
Celsius temperature to kelvins:
We can now calculate ∆Ssys:
∆Ssys =
qrev
T
= -571 J
234.3 K = -2.44 J>K
