y comparison, in elements of the second period, only the 2s and 2p valence orbitals are 
available for bonding. However, theoretical work on the bonding in molecules such as 
PF5 and SF6 suggests that the presence of unfilled 3d orbitals in P and S has a relatively 
minor impact on the formation of hypervalent molecules. Most chemists now believe 
that the larger size of the atoms from periods 3 through 6 is more important to explain 
hypervalency than is the presence of unfilled d orbitals.

SOLUTION
Iodine (group 7A) has seven valence electrons. Each chlorine 
atom (group 7A) also has seven. An extra electron is added to ac-
count for the 1- charge of the ion. Therefore, the total number of 
valence electrons is 7 + 14 * 72 + 1 = 36.
The I atom is the central atom in the ion. Putting eight electrons 
around each Cl atom (including a pair of electrons between I a
