o use restriction enzymes, which cut foreign DNA at
specific sites, producing DNA fragments. A specific fragment can be mixed together with a plasmid, and this
recombinant plasmid can then be taken up by E. coli.
Plasmids can give a transformed cell selective advantage. For example, if a plasmid carries genes that confer
resistance to an antibiotic like ampicillin, it can transfer these genes to the bacteria. These bacteria are then said
to be transformed. That means if ampicillin is in the culture, only transformed cells will grow. This is a clever
way scientists can find out which bacteria have taken up a plasmid.
In order to make a bacteria cell take up a plasmid, you must (1) add CaCl2, (2) heat shock the cells, and (3)
incubate them in order to allow the plasmid to cross the plasma membrane.
