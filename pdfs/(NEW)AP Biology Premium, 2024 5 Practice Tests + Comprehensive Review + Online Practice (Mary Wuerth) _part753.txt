 after the introduction of the carp. Bass decreased by about 50%, so choice
(A) is incorrect. Steelheads decreased by about 65%, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because
trout decreased by about 33%.
60. (B) The Simpson’s Diversity Index of the population in 1985 (0.7145) was greater than the Simpson’s
Diversity Index of the population in 1991 (0.6575). So the 1985 population would be more resilient and more
able to recover from an ecological disturbance. Choice (A) is incorrect because even though the population size
was the same both years, the population was much less diverse in 1991 than in 1985. Choice (C) is incorrect
because a higher Simpson’s Diversity Index makes a population more likely to recover from an ecological
disturbance. Choice (D) is incorrect because even though there was one more species present in 1991 than in
1985, there was less diversity in 1991 than in 1985.
