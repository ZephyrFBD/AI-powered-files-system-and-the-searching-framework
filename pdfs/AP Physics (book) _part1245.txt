25. (III) A 1.60-kg object oscillates at the end of a vertically
hanging light spring once every 0.45 s. (a) Write down the
equation giving its position 
as a function of
time 
Assume the object started by being compressed
16 cm from the equilibrium position (where
), and
released. (b) How long will it take to get to the equilibrium
position for the first time? (c) What will be its maximum
speed? (d) What will be the object’s maximum accelera-
tion, and where will it first be attained?
26. (III) Consider two objects, A and B, both undergoing
SHM, but with different frequencies, as described by the equa-
tions 
and
where 
is in seconds. After
find the next three 
times at which both objects simultaneously pass through
the origin.
