SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 20.3 
Balancing Redox Equations in Basic Solution
Step 2: We balance each half-reaction 
as if it took place in acidic solution:
Now we must take into account that 
the reaction occurs in basic solution, 
adding OH- to both sides of both 
half-reactions to neutralize H+:
We “neutralize” H+ and OH- by form-
ing H2O when they are on the same 
side of either half-reaction:
Next, we cancel water molecules that 
appear as both reactants and products:
CN-1aq2 + 2 OH-1aq2 ¡ CNO-1aq2 + H2O1l2 + 2 e-
3 e- + 2 H2O1l2 + MnO4
-1aq2 ¡ MnO21s2 + 4 OH-1aq2
Step 3: We multiply the cyanide half- 
reaction by 3, which gives six electrons 
on the product side, and multiply 
the permanganate half-reaction by 
2, which gives six electrons on the 
reactant side:
3 CN-1aq2 + 6 OH-1aq
