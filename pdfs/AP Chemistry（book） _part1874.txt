cal reactions, and the fact that it 
can easily be worked. However, pure gold is too soft for many applica-
tions, including jewelry. To increase its strength and hardness, as well 
as to modify its color, gold is often alloyed with other metals. In the 
jewelry trade pure gold is termed 24 karat. The karat number decreases 
as the mass percent of gold decreases. The most common alloys used 
in jewelry are 14 karat, which is 114>242 * 100 = 58% gold, and 18 
karat, which is 118>242 * 100 = 75% gold.
The color of gold varies depending on the metals it is alloyed with. 
Gold is typically alloyed with silver and/or copper. All three elements 
crystallize with a face-centered cubic structure. The fact that all three 
elements have similar radii (Au and Ag are nearly the same size; Cu is 
roughly 11% smaller) and crystallize with the same type of structure 
make it possible to form substitutional alloys with nearly any composi-
tion. The variations in color of these alloys as a function of
