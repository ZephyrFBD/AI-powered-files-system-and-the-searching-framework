regulate hormone release from pituitary gland; produce oxytocin;
produce uterine contractions and milk secretion in females
Hypothalamus
antidiuretic hormone
(ADH)
water reabsorption from kidneys; vasoconstriction to increase blood
pressure
growth hormone
(GH)
promotes growth of body tissues, protein synthesis; metabolic functions
prolactin (PRL)
promotes milk production
thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH)
stimulates thyroid hormone release
adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH)
stimulates hormone release by adrenal cortex, glucocorticoids
follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH)
stimulates gamete production (both ova and sperm); secretion of
estradiol
