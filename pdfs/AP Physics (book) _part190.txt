locity as Slope
Analysis of motion using graphs can give us additional insight into kinematics.
Let us draw a graph of x vs.
making the choice that at  
the position of an
object is  
and the object is moving at a constant velocity,
Our graph starts at  
(the origin). The graph of the
position increases linearly in time because, by Eq. 2–2,
and 
is a
constant. So the graph of x vs.
is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 2–26. The
small (shaded) triangle on the graph indicates the slope of the straight line:
We see, using the definition of average velocity (Eq. 2–2), that the slope of the
x vs.
graph is equal to the velocity. And, as can be seen from the small triangle
on the graph,
which is the given velocity.
If the object’s velocity changes in time, we might have an x vs.
graph like 
that shown in Fig. 2–27. (Note that this graph is different from showing the
“path” of an object on an x vs. y plot.) Suppose the object is at position 
at time 
and at position 
at time 
and 
represent th
