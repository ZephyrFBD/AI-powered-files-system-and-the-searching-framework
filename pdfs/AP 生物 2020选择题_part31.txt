f a cell. 
The scientist built a tube that was divided by an 
artificial membrane and filled with distilled 
water. The scientist put a known amount of a 
protein into the water on one side of the 
membrane. After some time, the scientist 
measured the concentration of the protein on 
either side of the membrane but found that there 
had been no change. 
Which of the following experimental changes 
would allow the scientist to observe transport of 
a solute across the artificial membrane? 
(A) Increase the solute concentration in the 
solution 
(B) Use a small, nonpolar solute instead of a 
protein 
(C) Increase the temperature of the solution 
(D) Add artificial aquaporins to the membrane 
30. Which of the following best illustrates the flow 
of information required for the synthesis of 
proteins encoded in the genome of a retrovirus? 
(A) 
 
 
(B) 
(C)
(D)
31. Which of the following best describes the 
process by which gas from the atmosphere is 
obtained by plants and used to build
