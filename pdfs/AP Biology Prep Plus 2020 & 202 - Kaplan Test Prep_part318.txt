The contractions of intestinal muscle decrease a»áer the
addition of epinephrine because epinephrine competes with
acetylcholine for a binding receptor in the membrane.
(A)
The activation of the transducing cascade triggers activation
of protein kinase A and inhibition of glucose synthesis.
(B)
Epinephrine initiates a signaling cascade that activates
protein kinase A, thereby indirectly decreasing muscle
contraction.
(C)
Epinephrine activates the membrane receptor, which inhibits
the activation of adenylyl cyclase, preventing production of a
second messenger.
(D)
3. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are signaling receptors that
consist of an extracellular region that binds the ligand, a
hydrophobic region that spans the membrane, and a cytoplasmic
region that acts as a tyrosine kinase enzyme.
The phosphorylation of RTK starts the signaling cascade in the
cell. To pinpoint the appearance of RTKs during evolution,
scientists analyze the genomes of several single-celled protists.
