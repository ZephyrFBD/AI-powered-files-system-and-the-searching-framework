cells. The Y-strain then
became pathogenic. Later, the work of Avery, MacLeod, and
McCarty identified this “transformation factor” as DNA. (IST-1)
(A) Methylation suppresses a gene or an entire chromosome. In fact,
it is responsible for the random inactivation of one of the X
chromosomes in every cell in a human female. If this inactivation
did not occur, females would have double the normal/necessary X
chromosome genes and the proteins that are produced from it.
Alternative splicing involves the fact that one gene can be
transcribed in more than one way, producing many different
proteins. Transduction refers to the fact that bacteria can uptake
genes from other bacteria. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme found
in retroviruses. (IST-2)
(C) A single point substitution might not cause any change in the
amino acid sequence because of wobble. For example, codons UUU
and UUA both code for the same amino acid, phenylalanine.
Deletions have more serious consequences because they cause a
