 7.73  Compare the elements bromine and chlorine with respect to 
the following properties: (a) electron configuration, (b) most 
common ionic charge, (c) first ionization energy, (d) reac-
tivity toward water, (e) electron affinity, (f) atomic radius. 
Account for the differences between the two elements.
 7.74  Little is known about the properties of astatine, At, because 
of its rarity and high radioactivity. Nevertheless, it is possible 
for us to make many predictions about its properties. (a) Do 
you expect the element to be a gas, liquid, or solid at room 
temperature? Explain. (b) Would you expect At to be a metal, 
nonmetal, or metalloid? Explain. (c) What is the chemical 
formula of the compound it forms with Na?
 7.75  Until the early 1960s, the group 8A elements were called
