emissions is not restricted to the United States, however. China, which generates about 
70% of its energy from coal, is the worldâ€™s largest generator of SO2, producing about

problem with SO2 pollution and has set targets to reduce emissions with some success. 
While China leads the world in SO2 emissions, India, where coal is a major source of 
energy, is rapidly catching up. Whereas levels of SO2 emissions in China peaked in 2007, 
India saw atmospheric SO2 levels double between 2005 and 2014. Nations will need to 
work together to address what has truly become a glo
