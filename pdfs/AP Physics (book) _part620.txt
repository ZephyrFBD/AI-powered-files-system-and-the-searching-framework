FIGURE 6–19 Example 6–9.
Speeds on two water slides. Two water
slides at a pool are shaped differently, but start at the same height h (Fig. 6–19).
Two riders start from rest at the same time on different slides. (a) Which rider, Paul
or Corinne, is traveling faster at the bottom? (b) Which rider makes it to the
bottom first? Ignore friction and assume both slides have the same path length.
RESPONSE (a) Each rider’s initial potential energy mgh gets transformed to
kinetic energy, so the speed v at the bottom is obtained from  
The
mass cancels and so the speed will be the same, regardless of the mass of the rider.
Since they descend the same vertical height, they will finish with the same speed.
(b) No
