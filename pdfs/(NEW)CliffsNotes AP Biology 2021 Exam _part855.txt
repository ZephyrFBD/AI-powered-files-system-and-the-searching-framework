Questions 36-40 refer to the following graph that shows the changes in electrical potential across the membrane of
a neuron during the transmission of a nerve impulse.
36. During which stage of the graph do voltage-gated ion
channels open
 
to allow K+ to cross the plasma membrane of the neuron?
 
37. During which stage of the action potential do voltage-gated ion
 
channels fully open to allow Na+ to cross the plasma membrane of the
 
neuron?
 
38. What is the minimum voltage that a stimulus must generate on the plasma membrane of the neuron in order to
elicit an action potential?
