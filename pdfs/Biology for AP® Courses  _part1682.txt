t be added later, once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm. Through
the process of tRNA “charging,” each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called

aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids; the
exact number of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species. These enzymes first bind and hydrolyze ATP to catalyze a
high-energy bond between an amino acid and adenosine monophosphate (AMP); a pyrophosphate molecule is expelled in
this reaction. The activated amino acid is then transferred to the tRNA, and AMP is released.
The Mechanism of Protein Synthesis
As with mRNA synthesis, protein synthesis can be divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. The
process of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we’ll explore how translation occurs in E. coli, a
representative prokaryote, and specify any
