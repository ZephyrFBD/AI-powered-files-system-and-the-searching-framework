 are the stages of an action potential, and how are action potentials propagated?
•
What are the similarities and differences between chemical and electrical synapses?
•
What is long-term potentiation and long-term depression, and how do both relate to transmission of impulses across
synapses?

The neuron is a great example of a structure-function relationship at the cellular level. Information flow along a neuron is
usually from dendrite to axon and from neuron to neuron or from neuron to a cell of a target organ. Like other eukaryotic
cells, neurons consist of a cell membrane, nucleus, and organelles, including mitochondria. Action potentials propagate
impulses along neurons. When an axon is at rest, the membrane is said to be polarized; that is, there is an electrochemical
gradient across it, with the inside of the membrane being more negatively charged than the outside. We explored the
formation of electrochemical gradients using H+ when we studied photosy
