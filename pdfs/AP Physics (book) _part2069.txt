he current in the 
resistor?
APPROACH To find the current out of the battery, we first need to determine
the equivalent resistance 
of the entire circuit, including r, which we do by
identifying and isolating simple series or parallel combinations of resistors.
Once we find I from Ohm’s law,
we get the terminal voltage using
For (c) we apply Ohm’s law to the 
resistor.
SOLUTION (a) We want to determine the equivalent resistance of the circuit.
But where do we start? We note that the 
and 
resistors are in parallel,
and so have an equivalent resistance 
given by
so 
This 
is in series with the 
resistor, as shown in the
equivalent circuit of Fig. 19–10b. The net resistance of the lower arm of the
circuit is then
as shown in Fig. 19–10c. The equivalent resistance 
of the 
and 
resistances in parallel is given by
so 
This 
is in series with the 
resistor
and the 
internal resistance of the battery (Fig. 19–10d), so the total
equivalent resistance 
of the circuit is
Hence the current drawn
