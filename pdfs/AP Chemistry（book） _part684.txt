ons is known as thermodynamics (Greek: 
thérme-, “heat”; dy’namis, “power”). This area of study began during the Industrial Rev-
olution in order to develop the relationships among heat, work, and fuels in steam en-
gines. Here we will examine the relationships between chemical reactions and energy 
changes that involve heat. This portion of thermodynamics is called thermochemistry. 
We will discuss additional aspects of thermodynamics in Chapter 19.
5.1 ∣ The Nature of Chemical Energy
As we learned in Chapter 1 (Section 1.4), energy is defined as the capacity to do work or 
transfer heat. Anyone who has sat by a fire or used a propane grill has witnessed chemical 
reactions that release heat [Figure 5.1(a)]. Some chemical reactions also absorb heat, such 
as those that occur when you cook. Chemical reactions can also do work in various ways. 
Recall the definition of work from Chapter 1:
 
w = F * d 
[5.1]
For example, the combustion reaction between gasoline and oxygen produces gases
