onsistently transduced; (A) correctly outlines the steps of this
process. (B), which describes the transfer of a gene by transformation
aȇer viral infection, can be eliminated because the question stem
states that the genes for toxins are transmitted through viral infection.
(C) is incorrect because a virus would be unable to incorporate RNA
into a host cell’s chromosome. (D) is incorrect because it does not
explain how the viral DNA would become a part of the bacterial
genome, as posed in the question stem.

Learning Objective: 6.1
This virus is best categorized as a bacteriophage, (B), which is defined
as a virus that infects and replicates within a bacterium. A retrovirus is
a specific type of RNA virus that contains an enzyme called reverse
transcriptase, which allows it to reverse transcribe its RNA into DNA
aȇer entering a cell. Since not all RNA viruses are retroviruses and
there is nothing in the question stem to suggest that this virus uses
reverse transcriptase, (A) can
