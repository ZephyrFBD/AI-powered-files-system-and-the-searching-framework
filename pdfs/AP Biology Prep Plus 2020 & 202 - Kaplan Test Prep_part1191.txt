d alpha chain. Hemoglobin consisting of
two elongated alpha globins may no longer function properly.
(c) Sickle cell anemia results from a point mutation at codon 6 in the beta
globin of hemoglobin. Based on the information provided, determine the
type of mutation that causes sickle cell anemia. (1 point)

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Sickle cell anemia has adenine substituted for thymine, which codes for valine
rather than the normal glutamic acid in the hemoglobin protein. Clues that
this scenario describes a missense mutation include 1) the involvement of a
single codon, and 2) the protein that is still produced but with a different
amino acid, which affects the protein function. Silent mutations have no effect
on the protein, and nonsense mutations would cause a stop where there
should not be one.
The two alpha globins of hemoglobin may be elongated, causing hemoglobin to no longer
function properly.
The mutation at codon 6 is a
