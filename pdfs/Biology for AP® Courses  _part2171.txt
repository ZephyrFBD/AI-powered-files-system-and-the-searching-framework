 of the large, polygynous orange males.

In this scenario, orange males will be favored by natural selection when the population is dominated by blue males, blue
males will thrive when the population is mostly yellow males, and yellow males will be selected for when orange males are
the most populous. As a result, populations of side-blotched lizards cycle in the distribution of these phenotypes—in one
generation, orange might be predominant, and then yellow males will begin to rise in frequency. Once yellow males make
up a majority of the population, blue males will be selected for. Finally, when blue males become common, orange males
will once again be favored.
Negative frequency-dependent selection serves to increase the population’s genetic variance by
