How Viruses Recognize a Host
Unlike living cells, many viruses do not have a plasma membrane or any of the structures necessary
to sustain life. Some viruses are simply composed of an inert protein shell containing DNA or RNA. To
reproduce, viruses must invade a living cell, which serves as a host, and then take over the hosts cellular
apparatus. But how does a virus recognize its host?
Viruses often bind to cell-surface receptors on the host cell. For example, the virus that causes human
influenza (flu) binds specifically to receptors on membranes of cells of the respiratory system. Chemical
differences in the cell-surface receptors among hosts mean that a virus that infects a specific species (for
example, humans) cannot infect another species (for example, chickens).
However, viruses have very small amounts of DNA or RNA compared to humans, and, as a result, viral
reproduction can occur rapidly. Viral reproduction invariably produces errors that can lead to changes in
