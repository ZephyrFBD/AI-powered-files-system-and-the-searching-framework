Scientists use the term bioenergetics to discuss the concept of energy flow (Figure 6.2) through living systems, such as
cells. Cellular processes such as the building and breaking down of complex molecules occur through stepwise chemical
reactions. Some of these chemical reactions are spontaneous and release energy, whereas others require energy to proceed.
Just as living things must continually consume food to replenish what has been used, cells must continually produce more
energy to replenish that used by the many energy-requiring chemical reactions that constantly take place. All of the chemical
reactions that take place inside cells, including those that use energy and those that release energy, are the cellâ€™s metabolism.
