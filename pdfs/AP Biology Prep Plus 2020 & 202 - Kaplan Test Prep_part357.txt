when answering AP Biology free response questions that require
you to create graphs.
Understanding of the experiment itself can be encapsulated in just a few
graphs. One or more of these graphs may be on the exam. The first graph
is about free energy and enzyme activity.
Before a reaction can take place, it must reach a point called its activation
energy by receiving enough energy from the environment, termed free
energy, in the form of heat or kinetic energy. An enzyme catalyzes a
reaction by lowering the activation energy needed (it requires less free
energy) to allow the reaction to take place. Hydrogen peroxide breaks
down into water and oxygen gas on its own, but at an incredibly slow
rate. The enzyme catalase lowers the activation energy of the reaction
and the reaction happens very quickly.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Many reactions that occur in biology can be sped up through the
addition of enzymes that lower a
