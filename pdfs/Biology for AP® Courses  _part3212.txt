ception of flavor is reduced if he or she has congested nasal passages.
Reception and Transduction
Odorants (odor molecules) enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium, the mucosa at the back of the nasal
cavity (as illustrated in Figure 27.8). The olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back
of the nasal cavity that spans an area about 5 cm2 in humans. Recall that sensory cells are neurons. An olfactory receptor,
which is a dendrite of a specialized neuron, responds when it binds certain molecules inhaled from the environment by
sending impulses directly to the olfactory bulb of the brain. Humans have about 12 million olfactory receptors, distributed
among hundreds of different receptor types that respond to different odors. Twelve million seems like a large number
of receptors, but compare that to other animals: rabbits have about 100 million, most dogs have about 1 billion, and
bloodhoundsâ€”dogs selectively bred for their sense of s
