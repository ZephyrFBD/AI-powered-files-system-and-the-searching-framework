. Papain is an 
enzyme that comes from papaya and is used in some teeth whiteners to break down 
the bacterial film on teeth. People who are lactose intolerant cannot digest milk sugar 
(lactose); however, they can take supplements containing lactase, the enzyme they are 
missing. All of these enzymes hydrolyze large, complex molecules into their simpler 
components; bromelain and papain break proteins down to amino acids, while lactase 
breaks lactose down to simpler sugars. 
Anabolic enzymes are equally vital to all living systems. One example is ATP 
synthase, the enzyme that stores cellular energy in ATP by combining ADP and 
phosphate. Another example is rubisco, an enzyme involved in the anabolic reactions of 
building sugar molecules in the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis.

To begin this investigation, you will focus on the enzyme peroxidase obtained from 
a turnip, one of numerous sources of th
