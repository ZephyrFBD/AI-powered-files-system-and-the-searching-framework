7. The deep sea vents model for the origin of life proposes that life
began at submarine hydrothermal vents rich in organic
molecules. The extreme heat found at deep sea vents provided
conditions favorable for chemosynthesis, the conversion of
carbon and nutrients into organic molecules (the building blocks
of life) in the absence of sunlight. Which of the following
statements would provide the best evidence for this model
regarding the origin of life?
Scientists discovered fossils of plants from 3.6 billion years
ago with organelles that had photosynthetic properties.
(A)
Fossils of a particular species of fish that is indigenous to only
the Atlantic ocean were found in three diï¬€erent oceans
across the globe.
(B)
Chemical analysis of fossils showed that the earliest forms of
life were thermophilic, meaning they lived in systems
composed of hot water.
(C)
Chemical analysis of fossils revealed that early yeast cells had
RNA molecules with enzymatic properties.
(D)
