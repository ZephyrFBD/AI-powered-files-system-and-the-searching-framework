ht object may be placed in order that a 
converging lens with 
will produce an image
three times the size of the object. Two students complete the
assignment at different times using identical equipment,
but when they compare notes later, they discover that
their answers for the object distance are not the same.
Explain why they do not necessarily need to repeat the lab,
and justify your response with a calculation.
3. Both a converging lens and a concave mirror can produce
virtual images that are larger than the object. Concave mir-
rors can be used as makeup mirrors, but converging lenses
cannot be. (a) Draw ray diagrams to explain why not.
(b) If a concave mirror has the same focal length as a
converging lens, and an object is placed first at a distance of
from the lens and then at a distance of 
from the
mirror, how will the magnification of the object compare
in the two cases?
4. (a) Did the person we see in Fig. 23â€“69 shoot the picture
we are looking at? We see her in three diffe
