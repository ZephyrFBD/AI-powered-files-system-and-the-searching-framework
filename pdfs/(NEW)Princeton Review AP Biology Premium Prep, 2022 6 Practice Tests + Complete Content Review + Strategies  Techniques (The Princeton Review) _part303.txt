hromosome will cross over between
them. This finding led to recombination mapping—mapping of linkage groups with each map unit being equal to 1
percent recombination. For example, if two linked genes, A and B, recombine with a frequency of 15 percent, and B
and C recombine with a frequency of 9 percent, and A and C recombine with a frequency of 24 percent, what is the
sequence and the distance between them?
The sequence and the distance of A-B-C is
If the recombination frequency between A and C had been 6 percent instead of 24 percent, the sequence and distance
of A-B-C would instead be
SEX-LINKED TRAITS
We already know that humans contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. Twenty-two of the pairs of chromosomes are
called autosomes. They code for many different traits. The other pair contains the sex chromosomes. This pair
determines the sex of an individual. A female has two X chromosomes. A male has one X and one Y chromosome—
an X from his mother and a Y from his father. Some traits, such as
