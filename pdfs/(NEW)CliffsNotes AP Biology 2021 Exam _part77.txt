hydrophobic R groups into the interior of the protein, and a disulfide bridge between two cysteine amino acids. The
summation of all of the interactions gives enzymes a globular shape.
b. The function of an enzyme is to speed up the rate of, or catalyze, a reaction. The induced-fit model describes how
enzymes work. In this model, there are specific active sites within the enzyme to which substrate molecules weakly
bond. When substrate molecules bond to the active sites, the enzyme changes shape in such a way as to reduce the
activation energy required for a bond to form between the substrate molecules. With less energy required, bonding
proceeds at a faster rate.
Many enzymes require a cofactor to catalyze a reaction. Cofactors include coenzymes (nonprotein, organic
molecules) and metal ions (like
 
Fe2+ or Mg2+).
c. There are several ways that enzymes are regulated. Allosteric enzymes are controlled by allosteric effectors,
substances that bind to the enzyme and inhibit (or activ
