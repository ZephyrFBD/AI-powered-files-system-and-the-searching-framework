 has more temporary functions. For
example, in transcription, mRNA carries the genetic information from the nucleus to the ribosome.
DNA is a double helix in which the two strands are antiparallel. One strand of the DNA is oriented with the 5′
phosphate group at the start of the strand, while the opposite strand has the 3′ hydroxyl (–OH) group at the start of
the strand. A purine on one of the strands is always paired with a pyrimidine on the opposite strand. Since purines
have a double-ringed structure and pyrimidines have a single-ringed structure, this keeps the width of the double
helix consistent.
RNA is typically single-stranded (in mRNAs and microRNAs) but can fold to form three-dimensional structures
in rRNAs in the ribosome and in tRNAs.
DNA Replication
The purpose of DNA replication is to ensure the continuity of genetic information between generations. Each of the
original two strands in the double helix serves as a template for a new strand, as shown in Figure 15.3. Since e
