d cells that can fuse during fertilization to form diploid
offspring. As with mitosis, DNA replication occurs prior to meiosis during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Meiosis is a series
of events that arrange and separate chromosomes and chromatids into daughter cells. During the interphases of meiosis,
each chromosome is duplicated. In meiosis, there are two rounds of nuclear division resulting in four nuclei and usually
four daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The first separates homologs, and the
second—like mitosis—separates chromatids into individual chromosomes. During meiosis, variation in the daughter

nuclei is introduced because of crossover in prophase I and random alignment of tetrads at metaphase I. The cells that are
produced by meiosis are genetically unique.
Meiosis and mitosis share similarities, but hav
