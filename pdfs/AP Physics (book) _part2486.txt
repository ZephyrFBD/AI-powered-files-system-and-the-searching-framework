After EM waves were experimentally detected, it became
generally accepted that light is an EM wave. The electromagnetic
spectrum includes EM waves of a wide variety of wavelengths,
from microwaves and radio waves to visible light to X-rays 
and gamma rays, all of which travel through space at a speed
The average intensity
