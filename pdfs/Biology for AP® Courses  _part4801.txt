How Much Area to Preserve?
Due to the way protected lands are allocated (they tend to contain less economically valuable resources rather than being
set aside specifically for the species or ecosystems at risk) and the way biodiversity is distributed, determining a target
percentage of land or marine habitat that should be protected to maintain biodiversity levels is challenging. The IUCN World
Parks Congress estimated that 11.5 percent of Earthâ€™s land surface was covered by preserves of various kinds in 2003. This
area is greater than previous goals; however, it only represents 9 out of 14 recognized major biomes. Research has shown
