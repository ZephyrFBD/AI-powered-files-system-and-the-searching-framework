Initiation of Transcription in Prokaryotes
Prokaryotes do not have membrane-enclosed nuclei. Therefore, the processes of transcription, translation, and mRNA
degradation can all occur simultaneously. The intracellular level of a bacterial protein can quickly be amplified by multiple
transcription and translation events occurring concurrently on the same DNA template. Prokaryotic transcription often
covers more than one gene and produces polycistronic mRNAs that specify more than one protein.
Our discussion here will exemplify transcription by describing this process in Escherichia coli, a well-studied bacterial
species. Although some differences exist between transcription in E. coli and transcription in archaea, an understanding of
E. coli transcription can be applied to virtually all bacterial species.
