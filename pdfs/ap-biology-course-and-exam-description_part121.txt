c. The transfer of electrons is accompanied by 
the formation of a proton gradient across 
the inner mitochondrial membrane or the 
internal membrane of chloroplasts, with 
the membrane(s) separating a region of 
high proton concentration from a region of 
low proton concentration. In prokaryotes, 
the passage of electrons is accompanied 
by the movement of protons across the 
plasma membrane.
d. The flow of protons back through 
membrane-bound ATP synthase by 
chemiosmosis drives the formation 
of ATP from ADP and inorganic 
phosp
