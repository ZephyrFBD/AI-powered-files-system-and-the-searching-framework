ll and set it there足
足 happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was still in my ears,
and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.
"I am thirsty for this water," said the little prince. "Give me some of it to drink..."
And I understood what he had been looking for.
I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some
special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment.
Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of
my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the
Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to
make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received.
"The men where you live," said the little prince, "raise five thousand roses in the
same garden足足 and they do not find in it what they are looking for."
"They do not find it," I replied.
