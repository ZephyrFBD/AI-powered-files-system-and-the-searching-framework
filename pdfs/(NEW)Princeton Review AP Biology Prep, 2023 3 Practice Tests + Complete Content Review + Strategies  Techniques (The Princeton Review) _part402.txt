nd traits. As with our example, these
species often originate from a common ancestor. More often than not, the “engine” of evolution is cataclysmic
environmental change, such as pollution in the case of the moths. Geographic barriers, new stresses, disease, and
dwindling resources are all factors in the process of evolution. Pre- and post-zygotic barriers also prevent organisms
of two different species from mating to produce viable offspring. Pre-zygotic barriers prevent fertilization.
Examples of this kind of barrier include temporal isolation, which occurs when two species reproduce at different
times of the year. A post-zygotic barrier is related to the inability of a hybrid organism to produce offspring. For
example, a horse and a donkey can mate to produce a mule, but mules are sterile and therefore cannot produce a
second generation.
Convergent evolution is the process by which two unrelated and dissimilar species come to have similar
(analogous) traits, often because they have b
