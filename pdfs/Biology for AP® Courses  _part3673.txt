Objective
1.17 The student is able to pose scientific questions about a group of organisms whose
relatedness is described by a phylogenetic tree or cladogram in order to (1) identify shared
characteristics, (2) make inferences about the evolutionary history of the group, and (3)
identify character data that could extend or improve the phylogenetic tree.
Essential
Knowledge
1.B.2 Phylogenetic trees and cladogram can represent traits, such as the number of heart
chambers in animals, which are derived or lost due to evolution.
Science
Practice
1.1 The student can create representations and models of natural or man-made phenomena
and systems in the domain.
Learning
Objective
