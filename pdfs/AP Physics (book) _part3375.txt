 as many,
nuclei. After another 5730 years it will
contain 
nuclei, and so on. This is shown in Fig. 30–10a. Since the rate
of decay 
is proportional to N, it, too, decreases by a factor of 2 every 
half-life (Fig. 30–10b).
The half-lives of known radioactive isotopes vary from very short (
s) 
to more than 
The half-lives of many isotopes are given 
in Appendix B. It should be clear that the half-life (which we designate 
) 
bears an inverse relationship to the decay constant. The longer the half-life of an
isotope, the more slowly it decays, and hence is smaller. Conversely, very active
isotopes (large ) have very short half-lives. The precise relationship between
half-life and decay constant is
(30;6)
We derive this in the next (optional) subsection.
