n molecules). Some physical properties of the noble-gas elements are listed in 
Table 7.8. The high radioactivity of radon (Rn, atomic number 86) has limited the study 
of its reaction chemistry and some of its properties.
The noble gases have completely filled s and p subshells. All elements of group 8A 
have large first ionization energies, and we see the expected decrease as we move down 
the column. Because the noble gases possess such stable electron configurations, they are 
exceptionally unreactive. In fact, until the early 1960s the elements were called the inert 
gases because they were thought to be incapable of forming chemical compounds. In 
1962, Neil Bartlett (1932â€“2008) at the University of British Columbia reasoned that the 
ionization energy of Xe might be low enough to allow it to form compounds. For this to 
happen, Xe would have to react with a substance with an extremely high ability to remove 
electrons from other substances, such as fluorine. Bartlett synthesized
