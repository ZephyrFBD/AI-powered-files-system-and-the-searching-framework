Pi), the G protein-coupled receptor
pathway is deactivated. The released GDP is free to reassociate with the G protein.
Glycogen breakdown in muscle and liver cells is an example of a cAMP signaling pathway. When a G protein is
activated by a signaling molecule (the hormone epinephrine), the G protein exchanges GTP for GDP on the effector
protein (adenylyl cyclase), which, in turn converts ATP to cAMP, a second messenger. The cAMP phosphorylates
(thus activating) a protein kinase (called PKA). Protein kinase activity leads to the activation of an enzyme that
removes single units of glucose from glycogen. (See Chapter 13, “Animal Form and Function,” for details
concerning the action of hormones.)
Protein Kinase Receptors
A protein kinase receptor is a transmembrane-protein enzyme. These enzymes are kinases, enzymes that add a
phosphate group to a protein.
 
Phosphorylation replaces the hydroxyl (OH−) group that occurs in an R
 
group of an amino acid with a phosphate (PO43−) group. Such
