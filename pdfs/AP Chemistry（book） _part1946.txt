ly interact with the rigid framework of aluminum, silicon, and 
oxygen atoms. Various pore and cavity sizes can be prepared by vary-
ing the chemical composition and synthesis method.
Zeolites may be synthesized with weakly interacting ions oc-
cupying the cavities. Upon exposure to ions that interact more 
strongly with the interior surfaces, there is a preferential exchange 
of weakly interacting ions for more strongly interacting ions. This 
effectively creates what we might think of as an ionic sponge. An 
example that illustrates this behavior is the use of a sodium zeolite 
to remove radioactive cesium (134Cs and 137Cs) from contaminated 
areas around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plants in Japan, 
which were damaged by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The 
cesium ions are attracted into the cavities of the zeolite where an 
ion exchange occurs (Cs+ for Na+). Another example is treatment 
of water from wells that contain relatively high concentrations of 
calcium, magnesi
