is shown
in Fig. 25–35. Light from a source is split into two equal beams by a half-silvered
mirror,
One beam passes through the object, and the second (comparison
beam) passes through an identical system without the object. The two meet again
and are superposed by the half-silvered mirror 
before entering the eyepiece
and eye. The path length (and amplitude) of the comparison beam is adjustable so
that the background can be dark; that is, full destructive interference occurs. Light
passing through the object (beam bd in Fig. 25–34) will also interfere with the com-
parison beam. But because of its different phase, the interference will not be
completely destructive. Thus it will appear brighter than the background. Where the
object varies in thickness, the phase difference between beams ac and bd in Fig.25–34
will be different, thus affecting the amount of interference. Hence variation in the
thickness of the object will appear as variations in brightness in the image.
