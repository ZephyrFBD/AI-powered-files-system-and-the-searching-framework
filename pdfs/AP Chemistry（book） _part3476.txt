 21.75  When two protons fuse in a star, the product is 2H plus a 
positron. Write the nuclear equation for this process.
 21.76  Nuclear scientists have synthesized approximately 1600 
nuclei not known in nature. More might be discovered 
with heavy-ion bombardment using high-energy particle 
accelerators. Complete and balance the following reac-
tions, which involve heavy-ion bombardments:

 21.77  In 2010, a team of scientists from Russia and the United 
States reported creation of the first atom of element 117, 
which is named tennessine, and whose symbol is Ts. The 
synthesis involved the collision of a target of 249
97Bk with 
accelerated ions of an isotope which we will denote Q. The 
product atom, which we will call Z, immediately releases 
neutrons and forms 294
