s. The high percentage of sugar decreases Î¨s,
which decreases the total water potential and causes water to move by osmosis from the adjacent xylem into the phloem
tubes, thereby increasing pressure. This increase in total water potential causes the bulk flow of phloem from source to
sink (Figure 23.37). Sucrose concentration in the sink cells is lower than in the phloem STEs because the sink sucrose has
been metabolized for growth, or converted to starch for storage or other polymers, such as cellulose, for structural integrity.
Unloading at the sink end of the phloem tube occurs by either diffusion or active transport of sucrose molecules from an
area of high concentration to one of low concentration. Water diffuses from the phloem by osmosis and is then transpired or
recycled via the xylem back into the phloem sap.
Figure 23.37 Sucrose is actively transported from source cells into companion cells and then into the sieve-tube
elements. This reduces the water potential, which causes
