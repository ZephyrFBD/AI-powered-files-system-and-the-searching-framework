 inquiry. If you want 
to modify a standard teacher-directed lab protocol, such as one included in the College 
Board’s 2001 AP Biology Lab Manual, you can eliminate the step-by-step procedure and 
instead ask students to develop their own procedure as a prelab activity. A template with 
a specific example is provided in Chapter 3 of this manual. 
The following charts provide an overview of the investigative labs and a mapping to 
the curriculum framework. These charts are designed to help you decide the order in 
which to introduce the labs. Regardless of your approach, the key is to engage students 
in the investigative process of science: discovering knowledge for themselves in a self-
reflective, organized manner.
