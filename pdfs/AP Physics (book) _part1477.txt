3. A steel plate has a hole in it with a diameter of exactly
1.0 cm when the plate is at a temperature of 20°C. A steel
ring has an inner diameter of exactly 1.0 cm at 20°C. Both
the plate and the ring are heated to 100°C. Which state-
ment is true?
(a) The hole in the plate gets smaller, and the opening in
the ring gets larger.
(b) The opening in the ring gets larger, but we need the
relative size of the plate and the hole to know what
