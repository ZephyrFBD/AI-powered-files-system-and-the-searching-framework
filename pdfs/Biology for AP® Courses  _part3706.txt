ures that oxygen-rich blood is delivered to all tissues and cells of the body where it will be used
for cellular respiration. Blood returning from the tissues is high in CO2 and low in O2 will return to the heart and be pumped
to the lungs, where gases are exchanged by diffusion at capillary beds.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the AP速
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP速 exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
