cles are then checked for uniformity by
physical and/or microscopic techniques. Once the purity is
determined, the particles may be further characterized. This would
include examining the structure, morphology, and chemical
composition of the particles. Next, their genetic makeup is
characterized by extracting the genetic material directly from the
puriﬁed particles and using genetic-sequencing techniques, such as
Sanger sequencing, that have also been around for decades. Then
one does an analysis to conﬁrm that these uniform particles are
exogenous (outside) in origin as a virus is conceptualized to be, and
not the normal breakdown products of dead and dying tissues.2 (As
of May 2020, we know that virologists have no way to determine
whether the particles they’re seeing are viruses or just normal break-
down products of dead and dying tissues.)3
