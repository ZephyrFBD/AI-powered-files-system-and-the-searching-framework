below are the mean and standard deviation from
measurements of a very large sample size.

A.
Analyze the data. Are the heights and stem
thicknesses in the transgenic plants significantly
different than in the wild type plant? Justify
your claim with evidence.
B.
Are the heights and stem thicknesses among the
transgenic plants significantly different? Justify
your claim with evidence.
C.
Plants from which these data were taken were
grown in 10 mM NaCl solutions. Pose one
