olve objects whose angular separation is
around
This corresponds to objects separated by 1 cm at a distance of about 20 m.
The typical near point of a human eye is about 25 cm. At this distance, the
eye can just resolve objects that are
apart.† Since the best light microscopes can resolve objects no smaller than about
200 nm at best (Eq. 25–9 for violet light,
), the useful magnification
is limited to about
In practice, magnifications of about 
are often used to minimize eyestrain.
Any greater magnification would simply make visible the diffraction pattern pro-
duced by the microscope objective lens.
