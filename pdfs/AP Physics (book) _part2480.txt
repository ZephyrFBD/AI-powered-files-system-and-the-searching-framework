 (Global System for Mobile
Communication), on 900-MHz and 1800-MHz bands. The U.S. now also has the
GSM option (at 850 MHz and 1.9 GHz), as does much of the rest of the Americas.
A 700-MHz band is being made available for cell phones (it used to carry TV
broadcast channels, no longer used). Radio-controlled toys (cars, sailboats,
robotic animals, etc.) can use various frequencies from 27 MHz to 75 MHz.
Automobile remote entry (keyless) may operate around 300 MHz or 400 MHz.
Cable TV channels are carried as electromagnetic waves along a coaxial cable
(Fig.22–9) rather than being broadcast and received through the “air.” The channels
are in the same part of the EM spectrum, hundreds of MHz, but some are at 
frequencies not available for TV broadcast. Digital satellite TV and radio are carried
in the microwave portion of the spectrum (12 to 14 GHz and 2.3 GHz, respectively).
Wireless from the Moon
In 1969, astronauts first landed on the Moon. It was shown live on television
(Fig. 22–20).
