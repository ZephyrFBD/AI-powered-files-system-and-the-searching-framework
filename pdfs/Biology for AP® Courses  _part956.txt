intercellular spaces until it reaches the mesophyll cells. Once in the mesophyll cells, CO2 diffuses into the stroma of
the chloroplastâ€”the site of light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. These reactions actually have several names
associated with them. Another term, the Calvin cycle, is named for the man who discovered it, and because these reactions
function as a cycle. Others call it the Calvin-Benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery.
The most outdated name is dark reactions, because light is not directly required (Figure 8.18). However, the term dark
reaction can be misleading because it implies incorrectly that the reaction only occurs at night or is independent of light,
which is why most scientists and instructors no longer use it.
