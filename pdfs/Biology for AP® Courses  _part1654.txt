of the SRY gene is a DNA binding protein. Together with a protein called SF1, the SRY protein
acts as a transcription factor that “turns on” certain genes. Which of the following statements best describes how a
change in these two proteins would affect male sexual development?
a.
A mutation that abolished activity of SF1 would increase the effect of a SRY mutation, making the person
more feminine.
b.
A mutation that abolished activity of SF1 would cancel out a mutation in SRY, so if both mutations occur
together male sex characteristics would develop normally.
c.
A mutation in the SRY protein that abolished activity would result in abnormal development of male sex
characteristics but a mutation of SF1 would not.
d.
Both a mutation in the SRY protein and a mutation in SF1 that abolished activity would result in a lack of
development of male sex characteristics.
