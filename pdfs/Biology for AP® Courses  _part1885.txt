es, other researchers observed that different traits were often inherited together, and thereby deduced that the genes
were physically linked by being located on the same chromosome. The mapping of genes relative to each other based on
linkage analysis led to the development of the first genetic maps.
Observations that certain traits were always linked and certain others were not linked came from studying the offspring of
crosses between parents with different traits. For example, in experiments performed on the garden pea, it was discovered
that the color of the flower and shape of the plantâ€™s pollen were linked traits, and therefore the genes encoding these traits
were in close proximity on the same chromosome. The exchange of DNA between homologous pairs of chromosomes is
called genetic recombination, which occurs by the crossing over of DNA between homologous strands of DNA, such as
nonsister chromatids. Linkage analysis involves studying the recombination frequency between any two
