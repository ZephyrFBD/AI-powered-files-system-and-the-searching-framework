 over and over 
again to be consistent with observations. However, no theory 
can be proven to be absolutely true. We can treat it as though it 
is, but there  
always remains a possibility that there is some re-
spect in which a theory is wrong. A famous example is Isaac New-
ton’s theory of mechanics, which yielded such precise results for 
the mechanical behavior of matter that no exceptions to it were 
found before the twentieth century. But Albert Einstein showed 
that  
Newton’s theory of the nature of space and time is incorrect.

SI Units
In 1960, an international agreement was reached specifying a particular choice of metric 
units for use in scientific measurements. These preferred units are called SI units, after the 
French Système International d’Unités. This system has seven base units from which all other 
units are derived (Table 1.3). In this chapter we will consider the base units for length, mass, 
and temperature.
