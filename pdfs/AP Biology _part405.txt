lutionary history. The fact that organisms share
many conserved (unchanged) processes is evidence that all
organisms are linked by lines of descent from a common ancestor.
For example, DNA and RNA are universal. They carry the same
genetic code across all domains.
All organisms are placed into one of three domains: Archaea,
Bacteria, and Eukarya. Organisms are grouped in a hierarchy of
increasingly exclusive categories called taxa: domain, kingdom,
phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. The taxon

classification—binomial
