otes do contain introns, so choice (D) is incorrect.
42. (D) Ribosomes are involved in translation, so an antibiotic that interferes with ribosomes would negatively
impact the process of translation. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because none of these processes (DNA
replication, posttranscriptional modification of mRNA, or transcription) involve ribosomes.
43. (B) Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns, which are removed before the mRNA exits the nucleus and enters the
cytoplasm, so eukaryotic mRNA is shorter than the DNA that codes for it. Choice (A) is incorrect because there
is no evidence in the question that the scientist made any errors. While RNA is a less stable molecule than DNA
due to the extra oxygen atom in RNAâ€™s five-carbon sugar, that is not the reason why eukaryotic mRNAs are
shorter than the genes that code for them. Thus, choice (C) is incorrect. The poly-A tail added to eukaryotic
mRNAs during posttranscriptional processing would make the mRNA longer, not shorter,
