Arterioles diverge into capillary beds. Capillary beds contain a large number (10 to 100) of capillaries that branch among
the cells and tissues of the body. Capillaries are narrow-diameter tubes that can fit red blood cells through in single file and
are the sites for the exchange of nutrients, waste, and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level. Fluid also crosses into the
interstitial space from the capillaries. The capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally
connect to major veins that take blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart. Veins are blood vessels that bring blood
back to the heart. The major veins drain blood from the sa
