46. What are endemic species? Give an example and
explain how endemic species differ from generalist
species.
a.
Endemic species are found naturally in specific
geographic areas that are usually restricted in
size. For example, the raccoon is found only in
Australia. Generalist species are found in a wide
range of geographical locations. For example,
the koala is native to most of North and Central

b.
Endemic species are those which are likely to be
extinct. For example, the koala (a marsupial) is
found only in Australia. Generalist species are
found in a wide range of geographical locations.
For example, the raccoon is native to most of
