A lens uses refraction to produce a real or virtual image.
Parallel rays of light are focused to a point, the focal point, by a
converging lens. The distance of the focal point from the lens is
the focal length f of the lens. It is the same on both sides of the lens.
After parallel rays pass through a diverging lens, they
appear to diverge from a point in front of the lens, which is its
focal point; and the corresponding focal length is considered
negative.
The power P of a lens, which is 
(Eq. 23–7), is
given in diopters, which are units of inverse meters 
For a given object, the position and size of the image formed
by a lens can be found approximately by ray tracing. Algebrai-
