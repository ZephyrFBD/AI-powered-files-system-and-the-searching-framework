be attributed only to the following:
1. Consumption of oxygen (due to respiration)
2. Changes in temperature
3. Changes in atmospheric pressure
Unless you are specifically investigating the effect of temperature or pressure on respiration, you must ensure that
these two variables remain constant when comparing the results of experimental treatments.
Part I: Determining the Rate of Respiration
Either microrespirometers or gas pressure sensors can be used to measure
 
O2 generation. Here is a brief summary for using microrespirometers:
1. To assemble a microrespirometer, use a glue gun to attach a capillary tube to the needle end of a syringe. Remove
the syringe plunger and insert cotton slightly moistened with a drop of KOH. Insert germinating seeds (or other
living organisms) and reinsert the plunger. Attach a calibrated gauge (ruler or other graduated scale) to the capillary
tube.
2. Assemble a second microrespirometer, but substitute baked seeds or glass beads for the germinating se
