hroughout the wire that begins as soon as the wire is connected to both terminals.
When the conventions of positive and negative charge were invented two
centuries ago, however, it was assumed that positive charge flowed in a wire.
For nearly all purposes, positive charge flowing in one direction is exactly 
equivalent to negative charge flowing in the opposite direction, as shown in 
Fig. 18–8. Today, we still use the historical convention of positive charge flow when
discussing the direction of a current. So when we speak of the current direction
in a circuit, we mean the direction positive charge would flow. This is sometimes
referred to as conventional current. When we want to speak of the direction of
electron flow, we will specifically state it is the electron current. In liquids and
gases, both positive and negative charges (ions) can move.
In practical life, such as rating the total charge of a car battery, you may see
the unit ampere-hour
