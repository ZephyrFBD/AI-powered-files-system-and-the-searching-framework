12). 
To illustrate how this bridge works, let’s calculate the number of copper atoms in an old 
copper penny. Such a penny has a mass of about 3 g, and for this illustration we will as-
sume it is 100% copper:
 Cu atoms = 13 g Cu2a 1 mol Cu
63.5 g Cub a6.02 * 1023 Cu atoms
1 mol Cu
b
 = 3 * 1022 Cu atoms
 
Sample Exercise 3.11
Converting Moles to Grams
Calculate the mass, in grams, of 0.433 mol of calcium nitrate.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
What is the mass, in grams, of (a) 6.33 mol of NaHCO3 and  
(b) 3.0 * 10-5 mol of sulfuric acid?
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
What is the mass, in grams, of (a) 0.50 mol of diamond (C) and 
(b) 0.155 mol of ammonium chloride?
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the number of moles and the name of a sub-
stance and asked to calculate the number of grams in the substance.
Plan To convert moles to grams, we need the molar mass, which 
we can calculate using the chemical formula and atomic weights.
Solve Because the calcium ion is Ca2 +  and the nitrate ion is NO3
-,
