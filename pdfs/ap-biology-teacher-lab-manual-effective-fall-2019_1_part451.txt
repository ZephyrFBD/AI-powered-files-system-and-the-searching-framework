1. The degrees of freedom (df) equals the number of treatment groups minus one 
multiplied by the number of phase groups minus one. In this case, there are two 
treatment groups (control, treated) and two phase groups (interphase, mitosis); 
therefore df = (2 − 1) (2 − 1) = 1. 
2. The ρ value is 0.05, and the critical value is 3.84. If the calculated chi-square value is 
greater than or equal to this critical value, then the null hypothesis is rejected. If the 
calculated chi-square value is less than this critical value, the null hypothesis is not 
rejected.
