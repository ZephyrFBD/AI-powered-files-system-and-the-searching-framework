y distortion or unwanted
(external) electrical signal that intrudes from outside, broadly called noise, can
badly corrupt an analog signal: Fig. 17–27a shows a time-varying analog signal, and
Fig. 17–27b shows nasty outside noise interfering with it. But a digital signal is
still readable unless the noise is very large, on the order of half the bit signal itself
(Figs. 17–27c and d).

FIGURE 17–26  This type of complex
signal is much more normal than the
pure sine wave of Fig. 17–25.
Sampling may not catch all the details,
especially because the waveform is
changing very fast in time.

signal is still readable (d) without 
error if the noise is not too great.
