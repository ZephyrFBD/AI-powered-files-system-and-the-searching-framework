■ Skills Development 
Students will develop the following skills: 
• Preparation of specimens for microscopic analyses 
• Data analysis and use of a statistical test 
• Calculation of crossover frequencies 
■ Potential Challenges 
Many students have memorized the stages of mitosis and meiosis without understanding 
the processes. These exercises emphasize the processes and results of cell division. You 
should have your students discuss the relationship between meiosis and evolution. 
The equipment costs, besides the microscopes, are minimal. Model chromosomes and 
karyotype pictures can be reused. Safety issues are minimized by treating and fixin
