Of two KBr solutions, one 0.50 m and the other 0.20 m, which is hypotonic with 
respect to the other?
Osmosis plays an important role in living systems. The membranes of red blood 
cells, for example, are semipermeable. Placing a red blood cell in a solution that is hyper-
tonic relative to the intracellular solution (the solution inside the cells) causes water to 
move out of the cell (Figure 13.23). This causes the cell to shrivel, a process called cren-
ation. Placing the cell in a solution that is hypotonic relative to the intracellular fluid 
causes water to move into the cell, which may cause the cell to rupture, a process called 
hemolysis. People who need body fluids or nutrients replaced but cannot be fed orally 
are given solutions by intravenous (IV) infusion, which feeds nutrients directly into the 
veins. To prevent crenation or hemolysis of red blood cells, the IV solutions must be iso-
tonic with the intracellular fluids of the blood cells.
