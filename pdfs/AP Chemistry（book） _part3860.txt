An amine with at least one H bonded to N can undergo a condensation reaction 
with a carboxylic acid to form an amide, which contains the carbonyl group 1C “O2 
attached to N (Table 24.6):

We may consider the amide functional group to be derived from a carboxylic acid with an 
NRR′, NH2, or NHR′ group replacing the OH of the acid, as in these examples:

where R and R′ are organic groups, is the key functional group in proteins, as we will see

24.5 ∣ Chirality in Organic Chemistry
A molecule possessing a nonsuperimposable mirror image is termed chiral (Greek cheir, 
“hand”). 
 (Section 23.4) Compounds containing carbon atoms with four different attached 
groups are inherently chir
