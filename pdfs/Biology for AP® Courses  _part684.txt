ion. Exergonic reactions are said to be spontaneous, because their products have
less energy than their reactants. The products of endergonic reactions have a higher energy state than the reactants, and so

these are nonspontaneous reactions. However, all reactions (including spontaneous –∆G reactions) require an initial input
of energy in order to reach the transition state, at which they’ll proceed. This initial input of energy is called the activation
energy.
6.3 | The Laws of Thermodynamics
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What is entropy?
•
What is the difference between the first and second laws of thermodynamics?
Connection for AP® Courses
In studying energy, scientists use the term system to refer to the matter and its environment involved in energy transfers,
such as an ecosystem. Even single cells are biological systems and all systems require energy to maintain order. The more
ordered a system is, the lower its entropy. E
