10 mol, calculate Kc for each system.
Sample Exercise 15.3
 Interpreting the Magnitude of an Equilibrium Constant
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to judge the relative magnitudes of three 
equilibrium constants and then to calculate them.
Plan (a) The more product present at equilibrium, relative to re-
actant, the larger the equilibrium constant. (b) The equilibrium 
constant is given by Equation 15.8.
Solve
(a) Each box contains 10 spheres. The amount of product in each 
varies as follows: (i) 6, (ii) 1, (iii) 8. Therefore, the equilibrium 
constant varies in the order (ii) 6  (i) 6  (iii), from smallest 
(most reactants) to largest (most products).
(b) In (i), we have 0.60 mol>L product and 0.40 mol>L re-
actant, giving Kc = 0.60>0.40 = 1.5. (You will get the 
same result by merely dividing the number of spheres of 
each kind: 6 spheres>4 spheres = 1.5.) In (ii), we have 
0.10 mol>L product and 0.90 mol>L reactant, giving 
Kc = 0.10>0.90 = 0.11 (or 1 sphere>9 spheres = 0.11). In 
(iii
