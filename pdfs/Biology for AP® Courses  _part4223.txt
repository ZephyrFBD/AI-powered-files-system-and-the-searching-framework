ic medium—water— has
different physical and chemical properties than air, however. Even if the water in a pond or other body of water is perfectly
clear (there are no suspended particles), water, on its own, absorbs light. As one descends into a deep body of water,
there will eventually be a depth which the sunlight cannot reach. While there are some abiotic and biotic factors in a
terrestrial ecosystem that might obscure light (like fog, dust, or insect swarms), usually these are not permanent features
of the environment. The importance of light in aquatic biomes is central to the communities of organisms found in both
freshwater and marine ecosystems. In freshwater systems, stratification due to differences in density is perhaps the most
critical abiotic factor and is related to the energy aspects of light. The thermal properties of water (rates of heating and
cooling) are significant to the function of marine systems and have major impacts on global climate and weather patterns.
