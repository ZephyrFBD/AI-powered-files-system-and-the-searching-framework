25. (D) Since males receive their sole X chromosome from their mother, all the males will have white eyes. All of
the females will receive an X chromosome with the dominant red allele from their father, so all of the females
will have red eyes. The following figure is a Punnett square that shows the genotypes of the parent flies and the
probable offspring from the cross.
26. (C) Transformation is the uptake of naked foreign DNA by a cell. Choice (A) is incorrect because transcription
describes the process of creating a complementary RNA copy of a DNA sequence. Transduction is the
introduction of foreign DNA into a cell by a virus, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because
translocation describes the exchange of genetic material between nonhomologous chromosomes.
27. (C) A person with sickle cell disease will be homozygous recessive, and a person with the sickle cell trait will
be heterozygous. Their offspring will have a 50% likelihood of having sickle cell disease, a
