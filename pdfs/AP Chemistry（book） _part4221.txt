intermolecular interactions. Figure 11.22 The temperature of the 
liquid water is increasing. Figure 11.24 Increases, because the 
molecules have more kinetic energy as the temperature increases and 
can escape more easily Figure 11.25 All liquids including ethylene 
glycol reach their normal boiling point when their vapor pressure 
is equal to atmospheric pressure, 760 torr. Figure 11.27 It must be 
lower than the temperature at the triple point.

Figure 12.5 There is not a centered square lattice, because if you 
tile squares and put lattice points on the corners and the center of 
each square it would be possible to draw a smaller square (rotated by 
45°) that only has lattice points on the corners. Hence a “centered 
square lattice” would be indistinguishable from a primitive square 
lattice with a smaller unit cell. Figure 12.12 Face-centered cubic, 
assuming similar size spheres and cell edge lengths, since there are 
more atoms per volume for this unit cell compa
