Give It Some Thought
What are the oxidation states of the H atoms in Equations 22.7–22.11?
A Closer look The Hydrogen Economy
The reaction of hydrogen with oxygen is highly exothermic:
   
2 H21g2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 H2O1g2 ∆H = -483.6 kJ 
[22.12]
Because H2 has a low molar mass and a high enthalpy of combus-
tion, it has a high energy density by mass. (That is, its combustion 
produces high energy per gram.) The only product of the reaction 
is water vapor, which means that hydrogen is environmentally 
cleaner than fossil fuels. Thus, the prospect of using hydrogen 
widely as a fuel is attractive. Furthermore, the hydrogen can be uti-
lized as a fuel in hydrogen fuel cells, enhancing the efficiency of its 
use. 
 (Section 20.7)
The term hydrogen economy is used to describe the concept of 
delivering and using hydrogen as a fuel in place of f
