rst ionization energy is the best indicator of 
whether an element behaves as a metal or a nonmetal.
Figure 7.15 shows the oxidation states of representative ions of metals and non-
metals. As noted in Section 2.7, the charge on any alkali metal ion in a compound is 
always 1+, and that on any alkaline earth metal is always 2+. For atoms belonging to 
either of these groups, the outer s electrons are easily lost, yielding a noble-gas elec-
tron configuration. For metals belonging to groups with partially occupied p orbitals 
(groups 3Aâ€“7A), cations are formed either by losing only the outer p electrons (such as 
Sn2+) or the outer s and p electrons (such as Sn4+). The charge on transition-metal ions 
does not follow an obvious pattern. One characteristic of the transition metals is their 
ability to form more than one cation. For example, compounds of Fe2+ and Fe3+ are 
both very common.
