. The signaling allows other bacteria to evaluate the
local density of bacteria, a process called quorum sensing. When bacteria respond and aggregate, they form
biofilms, dense populations of bacteria linked by their adhesive proteins. Biofilms, in the form of dental plaque, are
responsible for tooth decay, and biofilms that form on the inside of bladder walls are responsible for many urinary
tract infections.
Domain Archaea
Archaea are similar to bacteria in that both are prokaryotes. They differ from bacteria and from eukaryotes (Eukarya)
by the following features:
1. Archaeal cell walls contain various polysaccharides, but not peptidoglycans (as in bacteria), cellulose (as in
plants), or chitin (as in fungi).
2. Archaeal plasma membranes contain phospholipids that differ from the phospholipids of bacteria and eukaryotes.
Archaea are similar to eukaryotes in the following respects:
1. Some antibiotics work by disabling ribosome activity and disrupting protein synthesis. Ribosome acti
