Is ∆H f
° for O3(g) necessarily zero?
 
SECTION 5.7   
Enthalpies of Formation 
189
reaction is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products minus the 
standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants:
 
∆H°
rxn = Σn∆H f°1products2 - Σm∆Hf°1reactants2 
[5.31]
The symbol Σ (sigma) means “the sum of,” and n and m are the stoichiometric 
coefficients of the relevant chemical equation. The first term on the right in Equa-
tion 5.31 represents the formation reactions of the products, which are written in 
the “forward” direction in the chemical equation, that is, elements reacting to form 
products. This term is analogous to Equations 5.27 and 5.28. The second term on 
 
the right in Equation 5.31 represents the reverse of the formation reactions of 
 
the reactants, analogous to Equation 5.26, which is why this term is preceded by a 
minus sign.
