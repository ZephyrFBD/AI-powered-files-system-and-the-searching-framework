chromosomes form the tetrads. In metaphase I, these pairs line up at the midway point between the two poles of the cell
to form the metaphase plate. Because there is an equal chance that a microtubule fiber will encounter a maternally or
paternally inherited chromosome, the arrangement of the tetrads at the metaphase plate is random. Any maternally inherited
chromosome may face either pole. Any paternally inherited chromosome may also face either pole. The orientation of each
tetrad is independent of the orientation of the other 22 tetrads.
This event—the random (or independent) assortment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate—is the second
mechanism that introduces variation into the gametes or spores. In each cell that undergoes meiosi
