CHAPTER SUMMARY
4.1 Studying Cells
A cell is the smallest unit of life. Most cells are so tiny that they cannot be seen with the naked eye. Therefore, scientists
use microscopes to study cells. Electron microscopes provide higher magnification, higher resolution, and more detail than

light microscopes. The unified cell theory states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, the cell is the basic
unit of life, and new cells arise from existing cells.
4.2 Prokaryotic Cells
Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms of the domains Bacteria and Archaea. All prokaryotes have plasma membranes,
cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA that is not membrane-bound. Most have peptidoglycan cell walls and many have
polysaccharide capsules. Prokaryotic cells range in diameter from 0.1 to 5.0 Î¼m.
As a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-vol
