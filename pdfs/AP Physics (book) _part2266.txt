20. (III) A proton (mass 
), a deuteron 
and an alpha particle 
are accelerated
by the same potential difference V and then enter a uniform
magnetic field 
where they move in circular paths per-
pendicular to 
Determine the radius of the paths for the
deuteron and alpha particle in terms of that for the proton.
21. (III) A 3.40-g bullet moves with a speed of 
per-
pendicular to the Earth’s magnetic field of 
If the bullet possesses a net charge of 
by
what distance will it be deflected from its path due to the
Earth’s magnetic field after it has traveled 1.50 km?
*22. (III) A Hall probe, consisting of a thin rectangular slab of
current-carrying material, is calibrated by placing it in
a known magnetic field of magnitude 0.10 T. When the
field is oriented normal to the slab’s rectangular face,
a Hall emf of 12 mV is me
