are located very far upstream, or even downstream, of the genes they are regulating.
However, when researchers limited their examination to human core promoter sequences that were defined
experimentally as sequences that bind the preinitiation complex, they found that promoters evolve even
faster than protein-coding genes.
It is still unclear how promoter evolution might correspond to the evolution of humans or other higher
organisms. However, the evolution of a promoter to effectively make more or less of a given gene product
is an intriguing alternative to the evolution of the genes themselves.
