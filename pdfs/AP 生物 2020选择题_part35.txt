ring 
meiosis. 
(D) The production of seeds is not required 
because triploid plants produce gametes 
without fertilization. 
36. PCR is a technique used to copy a target DNA 
sequence. Researchers often use DNA 
polymerase from Thermus aquaticus, a bacteria 
species that lives around hydrothermal vents. 
Which of the following best explains why the 
polymerase from the species T. aquaticus is 
often used for PCR ? 
(A) T. aquaticus polymerase has an optimal 
temperature of 68°C. 
(B) T. aquaticus polymerase does not denature 
at high temperatures. 
(C) T. aquaticus polymerase can be used more 
than once without degrading. 
(D) T. aquaticus polymerase adds nucleotides 
to both the 3¢ and 5¢ ends of DNA. 
37. A researcher is studying two different species. 
Which of the following sets of observations 
would best support the claim that the two 
species have structural similarities as a result of 
convergent evolution?
