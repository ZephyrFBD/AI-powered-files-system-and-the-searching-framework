that were at one time important for ancestral organisms.
4. Comparative Embryology—comparing the embryonic development of one organism to another.
5. Molecular Biology—used in the study of evolution by looking at homology in DNA and protein
sequences and genes; this study allows for an even broader level of comparison between organisms as
different as prokaryotes, plants, and humans.
Organisms share conserved core processes, which signal their evolution from a common
ancestor and how widely distributed these processes have become among different species.
Examples: DNA and RNA are carriers of genetic information through transcription, translation,
and replication; the genetic code of many organisms is shared and is evident in many modern
living systems; and many metabolic pathways, like glycolysis, are conserved.
Structural evidence, such as cytoskeletons, membrane-bound organelles, linear chromosomes,
and endomembrane systems, suggest that all eukaryotes are related.
