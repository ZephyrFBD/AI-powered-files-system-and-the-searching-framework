13–11 Real Gases; Phase Changes
55. (I) 
exists in what phase when the pressure is 35 atm
and the temperature is 35°C (Fig. 13–23)?
56. (I) (a) At atmospheric pressure, in what phases can 
exist? (b) For what range of pressures and temperatures can
be a liquid? Refer to Fig. 13–23.
57. (I) Water is in which phase when the pressure is 0.01 atm
and the temperature is (a) 90°C, (b)
58. (II) You have a sample of water and are able to control
temperature and pressure arbitrarily. (a) Using Fig. 13–22,
describe the phase changes you would see if you started at a
temperature of 85°C, a pressure of 180 atm, and decreased
the pressure down to 0.004 atm while keeping the temper-
ature fixed. (b) Repeat part (a) with the temperature at
0.0°C. Assume that you held the system at the starting 
conditions long enough for the system to stabilize before
making further changes.
13–12 Vapor Pressure and Humidity
59. (I) What is the partial pressure of water vapor at 30°C if
the humidity is 75%?
