ressure potential, in this
case ψ = –4.0 bars + 0.5 bars = –3.5 bars, which is higher than the water potential of the surrounding solution (–
5.0 bars). Water flows from higher water potential to lower water potential, so water will flow out of the plant
cell into the surrounding solution. Choices (A) and (B) are incorrect because water will not flow into the plant
cell. Choice (C) correctly states that water will flow out of the plant cell but incorrectly states that the plant cell
has a lower water potential than that of the surrounding solution.
6. (A) The solutions are in beakers that are open to the atmosphere, so ψp is 0 and the total water potential will be
equal to the solute potential. The formula for solute potential is
All four solutions are at the same temperature, and all four solutes are covalent compounds and have ionization
constants that equal 1. R is constant for all four solutions. So the water potential will be inversely proportional
to the concentration of the solu
