cules contains 12 H atoms. 
1212 * 10232 gives 24 * 1023 = 2.4 * 1024 H atoms, which is 
close to our result. Because we were asked for the number of H 
atoms, the units of our answer are correct. We check, too, for sig-
nificant  
figures. The given data had three significant figures, as 
does our answer.
 
SECTION 3.4   
Avogadro’s Number and the Mole 
95
The mass in grams of one mole, often abbreviated as 1 mol, of a substance 
(that is, the mass in grams per mole) is called the molar mass of the substance. 
 
The molar mass in grams per mole of any substance is numerically equal to its formula 
weight in atomic mass units. For NaCl, for example, the formula weight is 58.5 amu 
and the molar mass is 58.5 g/mol. Mole relationships for several other substances 
are shown in Table 3.2,  and Figure 3.10  shows 1 mol quantities of three common 
substances.
The entries in Table 3.2  for N and N2 point out the importance of stating the chem-
ical form of a substance when using the mole con
