 pea plant with an unknown genotype. You want to figure out the genotype by crossing it
with another plant and looking at the offspring. Which of the following plants would be the most helpful in
determining the genotype of the original plant?
(A) Any green pea plant
(B) A homozygous green plant
(C) A yellow pea plant
(D) None of the above
4. Which of the following best explains the single yellow pea producing plant in the F1 generation?
(A) Crossing-over occurred in the parental pea plant to provide genetic variation.
(B) The law of independent assortment: one homologous pair separated independently of the others during
gamete production in the parental pea plant.
(C) Nondisjunction in one of the parental pea plants caused an imbalance in chromosome distribution.
(D) A DNA polymerase error occurred during DNA replication just prior to meiosis.
5. If a yellow plant from the F2 generation is crossed with a green plant from the F1 generation, what would be
the green-to-yellow phenotype r
