ly off the shores of Scotland, where they have been observed previously. A team of
scientists wanted to determine if basking sharks in other areas of northern Europe can jump to similar heights.
The following data were obtained by that team.
(a) Basking sharks filter feed on plankton, tiny ocean organisms. Describe an adaptation and explain how that
adaptation could increase a shark’s fitness.
(b) Construct a graph plotting the mean jump height and confidence intervals represented by error bars.
(c) Identify which of the locations showed statistical differences in jump height compared to the Scotland
sharks. Explain how you know this.
(d) Basking sharks are endotherms like most other sharks. Predict how the environment may differ between
the Cornwall sampling site and the Isle of Man site. Justify your prediction.

chloroplasts. The energy is used to produce carbohydrates from carb
