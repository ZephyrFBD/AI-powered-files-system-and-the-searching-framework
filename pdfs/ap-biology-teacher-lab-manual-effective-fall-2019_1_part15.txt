d to as evolution, cellular processes: energy and 
communication, genetics and information transfer, and interactions, respectively, for 
the sake of brevity. The big ideas encompass the core scientific principles, theories, and 
processes governing organisms and biological systems. For each big idea, enduring 
 
understandings incorporate the core concepts that students should retain from the 
learning experience. 
A more student-directed, inquiry-based lab experience supports the AP Biology 
course revision and curricular requirements by providing opportunities for students to 
design plans for experiments, data collection, application of mathematical routines, and 
refinement of testable explanations and predictions. Such a lab experience reinforces the 
revised curriculumâ€™s focus on quantitative skills. 
The suite of laboratory investigations within the new lab manual supports the 
recommendation by the National Science Foundation (NSF) that science teachers build 
into their curri
