pieces out into the surrounding space. Instead, the Big Bang was the start of an
expansion of space itself. The observable universe was relatively very small at the
start and has been expanding, getting ever larger, ever since. The initial tiny uni-
verse of extremely dense matter is not to be thought of as a concentrated mass in
the midst of a much larger space around it. The initial tiny but dense universe was
the entire universe. There wouldnâ€™t have been anything else. When we say that
the universe was once smaller than it is now, we mean that the average separation
between objects (such as electrons or galaxies) was less. The universe may have
been infinite in extent even then, and it may still be now (only bigger). The
observable universe (that which we have the possibility of observing because
light has had time to reach us) is, however, finite.
A major piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang is the cosmic microwave
background radiation (or CMB) whose discovery came about a
