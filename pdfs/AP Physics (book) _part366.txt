the horizontal table. The normal force is not always vertical,
however. When you push against a wall, for example, the normal force with
which the wall pushes back on you is horizontal (Fig. 4–9). For an object on a
plane inclined at an angle to the horizontal, such as a skier or car on a hill, the
normal force acts perpendicular to the plane and so is not vertical.
