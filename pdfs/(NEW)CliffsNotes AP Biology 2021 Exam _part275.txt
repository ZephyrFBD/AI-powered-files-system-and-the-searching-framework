le (N) are XNXNand XNY, respectively, and both are normal. In order for a female to be color blind, she must
have two copies of the defective allele (XnXn). A male, however,
need inherit only one copy of the defective allele ( XnY) to be color blind. (Note how the Y chromosome is written
with no allele superscript because it has none of the genes that are on the X chromosome.) As a result, color
blindness, as well as other sex-linked genetic defects, are much more common in males. Heterozygous individuals,
who possess a recessive allele for a genetic disorder, do not express the disorder, but they are said to be carriers
since they can pass the defective allele to their offspring. Thus,
heterozygous females, females who are XNXn, have normal vision but are carriers.
X-Inactivation
During embryonic development in female mammals, one of the two X chromosomes in each cell does not uncoil
into chromatin. Instead, Xinactivation occurs, and one chromosome remains coiled as a dark, compact bo
