specific heats for gases depend on how the thermodynamic process
is carried out. Two important processes are those in which either the volume or
the pressure is kept constant, and Table D–1 shows how different they can be.
The difference in specific heats for gases is nicely explained in terms of the
first law of thermodynamics and kinetic theory. For gases we usually use molar
specific heats,
and 
which are defined as the heat required to raise 1 mol of
a gas by 1 K (or 1 C°) at constant volume and at constant pressure, respectively. In
analogy to Eq. 14–2, the heat Q needed to raise the temperature of n moles of gas
by 
is
(D;1a)
(D;1b)
We can see from the definition of molar specific heat (compare Eqs.14–2 and D–1)
that
where M is the molecular mass of the gas (
in 
).† The values
for molar specific heats are included in Table D–1. These values are nearly the
same for different gases that have the same number of atoms per molecule.
Now we use kinetic theory and imagine that an ideal
