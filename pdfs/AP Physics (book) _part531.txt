type of force or combination of forces.
[*When the speed of circular motion is not constant, the
acceleration has two components, tangential as well as 
centripetal.]
Newton’s law of universal gravitation states that every 
particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force

The direction of this force is along the line joining the two 
particles, and the force is always attractive. It is this gravitational
force that keeps the Moon revolving around the Earth, and the
planets revolving around the Sun.
Satellites revolving around the Earth are acted on by
gravity, but “stay up” because of their high tangential speed.
Newton’s three laws of motion, plus his law of universal
gravitation, constituted a wide-ranging theory of the universe.
With them, motion of objects on Earth and
