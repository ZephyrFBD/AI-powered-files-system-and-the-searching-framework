The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH increases blood calcium concentrations when calcium
ion levels fall below normal. PTH (1) enhances reabsorption of Ca2+ by the kidneys, (2) stimulates osteoclast activity
and inhibits osteoblast activity, and (3) it stimulates synthesis and secretion of calcitriol by the kidneys, which enhances
Ca2+ absorption by the digestive system. PTH is produced
