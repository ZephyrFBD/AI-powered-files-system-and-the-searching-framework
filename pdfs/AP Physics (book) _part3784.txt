the curvature being
greater near massive objects. The universe as a whole may be
curved. With sufficient mass, the curvature of the universe
would be positive, and the universe is closed and finite; other-
wise, it would be open and infinite. Today we believe the
universe is flat.
Distant galaxies display a redshift in their spectral lines,
originally interpreted as a Doppler shift. The universe is

other at speeds 
proportional to the distance (d) between

which is known as Hubbleâ€™s law (
is the Hubble parameter).
This expansion of the universe suggests an explosive origin,
the Big Bang, which occurred about 13.8 billion years ago. It is
not like an ordinary explosion, but rather an expansion of
space itself.
The cosmological principle assumes that the universe, on
a large scale, is homogeneous and isotropic.
Important evidence for the Big Bang model of the universe
