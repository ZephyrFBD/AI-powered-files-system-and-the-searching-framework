grass seeds (which store energy as starch)? 
•  Do small seeds of spring flowers, weeds, or grasses respire at a different rate from 
seeds from summer, fall, or winter plants? 
•  Do seeds from monocot plants respire at different rates from dicot plants? 
•  Do available nutrients affect the rate of respiration in germinating seeds? 
•  Can the same respirometer system be used to measure the rate of respiration in small 
invertebrates such as insects or earthworms? 
Step 1 Students are asked to design an experiment to investigate one of their 
own questions about cellular respiration or one of the questions above, using 
microrespirometers or gas pressure sensors. When identifying their design, students 
should address the following: 
•  What is the essential question being addressed? 
•  What assumptions are made about the question(s) being addressed? Can those 
assumptions be verified? 
•  Will the measurements you choose to make provide the necessary data to answer the 
question un
