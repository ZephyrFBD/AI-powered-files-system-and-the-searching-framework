sses.
b.  
Cellular processes that release energy may 
be coupled with cellular processes that 
require energy. 
c. 
EXCLUSION STATEMENT 
—Students will 
need to understand the concept of energy, but the 
equation for Gibbs free energy is beyond the scope 
of the course and the AP Exam.
ENE-1.H.3
Energy-related pathways in biological systems 
are sequential to allow for a more controlled 
and efficient transfer of energy. A product of 
a reaction in a metabolic pathway is generally 
the reactant for the subsequent step in 
the pathway.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
ENE-1
The highly complex organization of living systems requires constant input of energy 
and the exchange of macromolecules.
