es can rotate around a node so this does not matter.

D
Because molecular biology demonstrates where the actual mutations occurred (rather than just what
phenotype is observed), it is the most reliable; it allows you to detect changes that are not phenotypically
observable.

D
Because the brain is destroyed, it is not associated with the movement of the leg. Choice (A) is incorrect,
as reflex actions are automatic. Choices (B) and (C) can also be eliminated; both of these statements are
true but are not supported by the experiment.
59.
C
The DNA template strand is complementary to the mRNA strand. Using the mRNA strand, work
backward to establish the sequence of the DNA strand. Donâ€™t forget that DNA strands do not contain
uracil, so eliminate (B) and (D).
60.
B
Use the amino acid chart to determine the sequence after uracil is deleted. The deletion of uracil creates a
frameshift.
