There is a stable and unchanging environment in which a species can flourish.
The primary influencing factor on changes in speciation rate is environmental conditions. Under some conditions, selection
occurs quickly or radically. Consider a species of snails that had been living with the same basic form for many thousands
of years. Layers of their fossils would appear similar for a long time. When a change in the environment takes place—such
as a drop in the water level—a small number of organisms are separated from the rest in a brief period of time, essentially
forming one large and one tiny population. The tiny population faces new environmental conditions. Because its gene pool
quickly became so small, any variation that surfaces and that aids in surviving the new conditions becomes the predominant
form.
