ach segment of the earthworm. They are similar to flame cells in that they have a tubule
with cilia. Excretion occurs through a pore called the nephridiopore. They are more evolved than the flame cells in that
they have a system for tubular reabsorption by a capillary network before excretion.
Malpighian Tubules of Insects
Malpighian tubules are found lining the gut of some species of arthropods, such as the bee illustrated in Figure 32.12. They
are usually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect. Malpighian tubules are convoluted,
which increases their surface area, and they are lined with microvilli for reabsorption and maintenance of osmotic balance.
Malpighian tubules work cooperatively with specialized glands in the wall of the rectum. Body fluids are not filtered as
