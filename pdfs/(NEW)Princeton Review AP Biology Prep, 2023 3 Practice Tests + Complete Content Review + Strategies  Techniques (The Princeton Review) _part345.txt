 transcribed RNA. The way that a transcript is spliced can vary, and alternative
splicing variants will result with different exons included.
In addition to splicing, a poly(A) tail is added to the 3′ end and a 5′ GTP cap is added to the 5′ end.
TRANSLATION
Translation is the process of turning an mRNA into a protein that occurs on ribosomes in cytoplasm and on the
rough endoplasmic reticulum. Remember, each protein is made of amino acids. The order of the mRNA nucleotides
will be read in the ribosome in groups of three. Three nucleotides is called a codon. Each codon corresponds to a
particular amino acid. The genetic code is redundant, meaning that certain amino acids are specified by more than
one codon. Nearly all living organisms use the same genetic code, which is further evidence for a common ancestor.
The mRNA attaches to the ribosome to initiate translation and “waits” for the appropriate amino acids to come to the
ribosome. That’s where tRNA comes in. A tRNA molecule has a un
