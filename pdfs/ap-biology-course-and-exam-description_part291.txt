reaction.
d. Ratios.
e. Percentages. 
Calculate a ratio.
Calculate a percent change.
5.B: Use confidence 
intervals and/or error 
bars (both determined 
using standard errors) 
to determine whether 
sample means are 
statistically different.
Draw standard error bars,  
± 1 SEM or ±2 SEM.
Draw error bars for the 95% 
confidence interval.
Determine if there is overlap 
between the bars of two or 
more sample means. 
After completing an 
investigation such as the 
Diffusion and Osmosis 
lab, collect class data. 
The students graph the 
class data and calculate 
the descriptive statistics 
and then use the standard 
error bars to determine 
Graph and Switch
if two sample means are 
statistically different.
