gle ions, such as Na+,
K+, Ca2+, and Cl–. Many ion channels function as gated channels that
open and close in response to a stimulus. Voltage gated ion channels are
important in the passage of an impulse along an axon (see page 354).
Neither simple nor facilitated diffusion requires energy.

A special case of simple diffusion is called countercurrent exchange
—the flow of adjacent fluids in opposite directions that maximizes the rate
of simple diffusion. One example of countercurrent exchange can be seen
in fish gills. Blood flows toward the head in the gills, while water flows
over the gills in the opposite direction. This process maximizes the
diffusion of respiratory gases and wastes between the water and the fish;
see Figure 3.11.

Here is some basic vocabulary to aid in your understanding of passive
transport.
