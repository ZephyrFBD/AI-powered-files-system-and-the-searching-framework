to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms. Scientists
consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one cannot go back to confirm the proposed
relationships. In other words, a “tree of life” can be constructed to illustrate when different organisms evolved and to show
the relationships among different organisms (Figure 20.2).
Unlike a taxonomic classification diagram, a phylogenetic tree can be read like a map of evolutionary history. Many
phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor. Scientists call such trees rooted, which
means there is a single ancestral lineage (typically drawn from the bottom or left) to which all organisms represented in the
diagram relate. Notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains— Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya—diverge
from a single point and branch off. The small branch that plants and animals (including humans) occupy in this diagram
