Thus, ∆H = qP, as we saw in Equation 5.9.

5.4 ∣ Enthalpies of Reaction
Because ∆H = Hfinal - Hinitial, the enthalpy change for a chemical reaction is given by
 
∆H = Hproducts - Hreactants 
[5.15]
The enthalpy change that accompanies a reaction is called either the enthalpy of reaction 
or the heat of reaction and is sometimes written ∆Hrxn, where “rxn” is a commonly used 
abbreviation for “reaction.”
When we give a numerical value for ∆Hrxn, we must specify the reaction involved. 
For example, when 2 mol H21g2 burn to form 2 mol H2O1g2 at a constant pressure, the 
system releases 483.6 kJ of heat. We can summarize this information as
 
2 H21g2 + O21g2 ¡  2 H2O1g2   
∆H = -483.6 kJ 
[5.16]
The negative sign for ∆H tells us that this reaction is exothermic. Notice that ∆H is re-
ported at the end of the balanced equation, without explicitly specifying the amounts of 
chemicals involved. In such cases the coefficients in the balanced equation repre
