t an experiment performed with a larger sample size is considered more reliable than an experiment
performed with a smaller sample size. Standard error of the mean gives a mathematical reason for why experiments
with larger sample sizes are typically more reliable. Hereâ€™s how you would calculate the standard error of the mean
for data set A and data set B:
Data Set A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; s = 1.58 and n = 5
Data Set B: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3; s = 0 and n = 5
Standard error of the mean can be used to create a type of error bar on a graph called a 95% confidence interval
(95% CI). A 95% confidence interval does NOT mean you are 95% confident in your data! What a 95% confidence
interval does mean is that if you repeated an experiment 100 times and calculated the mean of the data you collected
each time, the mean would fall within the 95% confidence interval 95 of those 100 times. In other words, you would
expect your mean to fall within the 95% confidence interval 95% of the time, but 5% of the time you
