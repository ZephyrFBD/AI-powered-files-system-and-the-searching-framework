t from the equation.
Accordingly, the shape of bathtub actually has some impact on even time, but it
can be evaluated that these impacts will not be very huge. More importantly, normally
there are regular models to describe the shape of bathtub, and little difference varies
from each side of bathtub. Consequently, the shape of bathtub will not have great
impact on this element.
(2)Suffering degree:
The shape of bathtub will affect the surface between water and air, and we name
this area as S. We can learn from the modification of cooling model that
relates to S,
while the cooling time t affects the value of
and
which appears in suffering degree.
As a result, S affects E indirectly.
In simulation, we change the value of
S
and calculate
E . We get some useful
information below.
