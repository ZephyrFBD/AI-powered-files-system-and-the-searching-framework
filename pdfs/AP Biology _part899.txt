nt, hemoglobin drops off oxygen
more easily at body cells.
Hemoglobin A is found in mammals with a higher metabolism.
Banana plants, which are triploid, are seedless and therefore sterile.
What is the most likely explanation for why banana plants are
sterile?
Because they are triploid, bananas cannot generate gametes
because homologous pairs cannot line up during meiosis.
Because they are triploid, there are no male or female banana
plants.
Because they are triploid, bananas cannot pair up homologues
during mitosis.
Because they are triploid, bananas cannot carry out crossing-
over.
Animals maintain a minimum metabolic rate for basic functions
such as breathing, heart rate, and maintaining body temperature. The
minimum metabolic rate for an animal at rest is the basal metabolic
rate (BMR). The BMR is affected by many factors, including
whether an animal is an ectotherm or endotherm; its age and sex;
and its size and body mass. Below is a graph that shows the
relationship of BMR per kil
