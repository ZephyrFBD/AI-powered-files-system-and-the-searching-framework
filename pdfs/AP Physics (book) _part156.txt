so
A common problem is to determine the velocity of an object after any elapsed
time 
when we are given the object’s constant acceleration. We can solve such
problems† by solving for 
in the last equation: first we multiply both sides by ,
Then, adding 
to both sides, we obtain
[constant acceleration]
(2;6)
If an object, such as a motorcycle (Fig. 2–13), starts from rest
and
accelerates at 
after an elapsed time
its velocity will be
Next, let us see how to calculate the position x of an object after a time when
it undergoes constant acceleration. The definition of average velocity (Eq. 2–2)
is
which we can rewrite by multiplying both sides by
(2;7)
Because the velocity increases at a uniform rate, the average velocity,
will be
midway between the initial and final velocities:
[constant acceleration]
(2;8)
(Careful: Equation 2–8 is not necessarily valid if the acceleration is not constant.)
We combine the last two Equations with Eq. 2–6 and find, starting with Eq. 2–7,
or
[constant accel
