 some
enzymes are allosteric, meaning that a change in shape alters their
efficiency. Molecules called noncompetitive inhibitors or allosteric
regulators bind to a site distinct and separate from the active site of the
enzyme. This binding of the inhibitor to the alternate site causes the
enzyme to change shape in a way that inhibits the enzyme from catalyzing
substrate into product. Other allosteric enzymes usually toggle between
two different conformations (shapes)â€”one active and the other inactive.
The binding of either an activator or an inhibitor locks or stabilizes the
allosteric enzyme in either the active or inactive form, respectively. See
Figure 5.8. One economical mechanism for regulating a lengthy metabolic
pathway is known as feedback inhibition, where the end product of the
pathway is the allosteric inhibitor for an enzyme that catalyzes an early
step in the pathway: see Figure 5.9.
