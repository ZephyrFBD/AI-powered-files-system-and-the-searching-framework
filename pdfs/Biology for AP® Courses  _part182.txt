has been known for thousands of years, dating back to ancient Egypt.
It was not until the late 1800s, however, that the aspirin molecule, known as acetylsalicylic acid, was purified
and marketed for human use.
Occasionally, drugs developed for one use are found to have unforeseen effects that allow these drugs to
be used in other, unrelated ways. For example, the drug minoxidil was originally developed to treat high
blood pressure. When tested on humans, it was noticed that individuals taking the drug would grow new
hair. Eventually the drug was marketed to men and women with baldness to restore lost hair.
The career of the pharmaceutical chemist may involve detective work, experimentation, and drug
development, all with the goal of making human beings healthier.
