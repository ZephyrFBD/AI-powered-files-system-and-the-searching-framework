n this Chapter, we will study a special case in mechanicsâ€”when the net force
and the net torque on an object, or system of objects, are both zero. In this
case both the linear acceleration and the angular acceleration of the object or
system are zero. The object is either at rest, or its center of mass is moving at con-
stant velocity. We will be concerned mainly with the first situation, in which the
object or objects are all at rest, or static (
).
The net force and the net torque can be zero, but this does not imply that no
forces at all act on the objects. In fact it is virtually impossible to find an object on
which no forces act. Just how and where these forces act can be very important,
both for buildings and other structures, and in the human body.
Sometimes, as we shall see in this Chapter, the forces may be so g
