toms in the motif with respect to the lattice points. Sec-
ond, we see that bonds can be formed between atoms in neighboring unit cells and the 
bonds between atoms need not be parallel to the lattice vectors.
Face-centered cubic lattice
Primitive cubic lattice
Lattice points only at corners
Body-centered cubic lattice
Lattice points at corners plus
one lattice point in the center
of unit cell
Lattice points at corners plus
one lattice point at the center
of each face

The interconnected hexagonal rings become
apparent when we connect atoms from
neighboring unit cells.
Tile unit cells together to create
the crystal structure.
Begin with a single hexagonal
unit cell containing a motif of
two carbon atoms.
Atoms from neighboring
unit cells can bond
