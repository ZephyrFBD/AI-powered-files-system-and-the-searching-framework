chloride ion channels located on the surface of many epithelial cells. As shown in the figure, the mutation 
prevents the normal movement of chloride ions from the cytosol of the cell to the extracellular fluid. As a 
consequence of the mutation, the mucus layer that is normally present on the surface of the cells becomes 
exceptionally dehydrated and viscous. 
  An answer to which of the following questions would provide the most information about the association 
between the CFTR mutation and the viscous mucus? 
(A) Is the mucus also secreted from the cells through the CFTR proteins? 
(B) How does the disrupted chloride movement affect the movement of sodium ions and water by the cell? 
(C) How does the mutation alter the structure of the CFTR proteins? 
(D) What is the change in nucleotide sequence that results in the CFTR mutation?
