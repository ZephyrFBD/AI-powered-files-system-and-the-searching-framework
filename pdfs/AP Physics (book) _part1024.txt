s a vector, pressure is a scalar. Pressure has magnitude only. The
SI unit of pressure is 
This unit has the official name pascal (Pa), in honor
of Blaise Pascal (see Section 10–5); that is,
However, for sim-
plicity, we will often use 
Other units sometimes used are 
and
(pounds per square inch, abbreviated “psi”). Several other units for pressure
are discussed in Sections 10–4 and 10–6, along with conversions between them
(see also the Table inside the front cover).
Calculating pressure. A 60-kg person’s two feet cover 
an area of 
(a) Determine the pressure exerted by the two feet on the
ground. (b) If the person stands on one foot, what will be the pressure under
that foot?
APPROACH Assume the person is at rest. Then the ground pushes up on her
with a force equal to her weight mg, and she exerts a force mg on the ground
where her feet (or foot) contact it. Because
then
SOLUTION (a) The pressure on the ground exerted by the two feet is
(b) If the person stands on one foot, the force
