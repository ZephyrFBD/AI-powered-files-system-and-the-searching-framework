rying amino acids that have formed peptide bonds
with the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from their corresponding tRNA. The E (exit) site releases
dissociated tRNAs so that they can be recharged with free amino acids. There is one exception to this assembly line of
tRNAs: in E. coli, fMet âˆ’tRNAf
Met is capable of entering the P site directly without first entering the A site. Similarly,
the eukaryotic Met-tRNAi, with help from other proteins of the initiation complex, binds directly to the P site. In both cases,
this creates an initiation complex with a free A site ready to accept the tRNA corresponding to the first codon after the
AUG.
During translation elongation, the mRNA template provides specificity. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, each
mRNA codon comes into register, and specific binding with the corresponding charged tRNA anticodon is ensured. If
mRNA were not present in the elongation complex, the ribosome would bind tRNAs nonspecifically.
