. A glance at the
electromagnetic spectrum shows that visible light for humans is just a small slice of the entire spectrum, which includes
radiation that we cannot see as light because it is below the frequency of visible red light and above the frequency of visible
violet light.
Certain variables are important when discussing perception of light. Wavelength (which varies inversely with frequency)
manifests itself as hue. Light at the red end of the visible spectrum has longer wavelengths (and is lower frequency), while
light at the violet end has shorter wavelengths (and is higher frequency). The wavelength of light is expressed in nanometers
(nm); one nanometer is one billionth of a meter. Humans perceive light that ranges between approximately 380 nm and 740
nm. Some other animals, though, can detect wavelengths outside of the human range. For example, bees see near-ultraviolet
light in order to locate nectar guides on flowers, and some non-avian reptiles sense infrared light (heat
