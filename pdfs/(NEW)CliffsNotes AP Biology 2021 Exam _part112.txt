ly the net movement of molecules that moves down the gradient.
14. C. Animal cells, not plant cells, have plasma membranes that contain cholesterol. Both animals and plants have
cells with mitochondria and have ribosomes attached to the ER.
15. A. Ribosomes assemble amino acids into proteins. Such activity would be associated with rough endoplasmic
reticulum.
16. A. Phospholipids are the main constituent of plasma membranes and are not found in cell walls. Chitin is found
in the cell walls of fungi; polysaccharides are found in the cell walls of plants and archaea; peptidoglycans are found
in the cell walls of bacteria.
17. B. The solute, starch, cannot pass through the dialysis tubing. The dialysis bag will gain weight because water
will diffuse into it. Note that answer choice A refers to the movement of water and answer choice B refers to the
movement of the solute and that both describe the gradient relative to the solute. Also note that the distilled water in
the beaker is hypoton
