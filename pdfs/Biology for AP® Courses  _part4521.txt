y low numbers of
sexually mature individuals. What hypothesis might a
researcher propose about mortality patterns in this
population and how would a researcher follow up to test
their hypothesis?

a.
A researcher might propose the mortality rate of
this species is very high during the
developmental period after sexual maturity is
reached. This hypothesis can be tested by
constructing a life table and calculating mortality
rates at different age intervals.
b.
A researcher might propose the mortality rate of
this species is very high during the
developmental period before sexual maturity is
reached. This hypothesis can be tested by using
the mark and recapture method and calculating
population densities.
c.
A researcher might propose the mortality rate of
this species is very high during the
developmental period before sexual maturity is
reached. This hypothesis can be tested by
constructing a life table and calculating mortality
rates at
