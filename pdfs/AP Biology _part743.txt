and four variable regions (V). The
tips of the Y have specific shapes and are the binding sites for different
antigens.
It is now accepted that the blueprints for antibodies are made early in
life, prior to any exposure to antigens. When you are exposed to an
antigen, antibodies are chosen by clonal selection from a limitless variety
as needed.
As a consequence, the variety in antibodies is unlimited and there is no
viral disease for which humans cannot produce antibodies.
Figure 17.4 is a graph that shows immunological memory:
 
Day 1: First exposure to antigen A.
Day 15: Maximum production of antibodies against A; the individual
will fight off the infection.
Day 28: There is another exposure (a second challenge) to antigen A.
Day 28 to Day 35: There is a secondary immune response that is more
rapid and more intense than the primary immune response. This is due
to immunological memory.
Day 28: First exposure to antigen B. This is another primary immune
response. The fact that there wa
