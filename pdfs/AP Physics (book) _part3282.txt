of diodes can be used to accurately regulate a voltage supply.
A diode designed for this purpose is called a zener diode. When placed across 
the output of an unregulated power supply, a zener diode can maintain the voltage
at its own breakdown voltage as long as the supply voltage is always above this
point. Zener diodes can be obtained corresponding to voltages of a few volts to
hundreds of volts.
A diode is called a nonlinear device because the current is not proportional
to the voltage. That is, a graph of current versus voltage (Fig. 29–30) is not a
straight line, as it is for a resistor (which ideally is linear).
Rectifiers
Since a pn junction diode allows current to flow only in one direction (as long 
as the voltage is not too high), it can serve as a rectifier—to change ac into dc.
A simple rectifier circuit is shown in Fig. 29–31a. The ac source applies a voltage
across the diode alternately positive and negative. Only during half of each cycle
will a current pass through the
