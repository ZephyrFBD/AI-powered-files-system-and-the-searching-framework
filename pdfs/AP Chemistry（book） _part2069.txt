Calculation of Molarity Using the Density of the Solution
Plan The molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute 
divided by the number of liters of solution (Equation 13.8). The 
number of moles of solute 1C7H82 is calculated from the number of 
grams of solute and its molar mass. The volume of the solution is ob-
tained from the mass of the solution (mass of solution =  mass of 
solute + mass of solvent = 5.0 g + 225 g = 230 g) and its density.
The density of the solution is used to con-
vert the mass of the solution to its volume:
Molarity is moles of solute per liter of 
solution:

CHAPTER 13 Properties of Solutions
13.5 ∣ Colligative Properties
Some physical properties of solutions differ in important ways from those of the pure 
solvent. For example, pure water freezes at 0 °C, but aqueous solutions freeze at lower 
temperatures. We apply this behavior when we add ethylene glycol antifreeze t
