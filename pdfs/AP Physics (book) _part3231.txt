the
decreases as the atoms approach, because the electrons concentrate between
the two nuclei (Fig. 29–2), so attraction occurs. However, at very short distances,
the electrons would be “squeezed out”—there is no room for them between 
the two nuclei. Without the electrons between them, each nucleus would feel 
a repulsive force due to the other, so the curve rises as r decreases further.
