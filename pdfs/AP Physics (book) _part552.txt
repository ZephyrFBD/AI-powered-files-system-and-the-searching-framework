e. Which satellite is faster,
and by what factor?
51. (II) What will a spring scale read for the weight of a 58.0-kg
woman in an elevator that moves (a) upward with constant
speed 
(b) downward with constant speed 
(c) with an upward acceleration 0.23 g, (d) with a downward
acceleration 0.23 g, and (e) in free fall?
52. (II) Determine the time it takes for a satellite to orbit the
Earth in a circular near-Earth orbit. A “near-Earth” orbit
is at a height above the surface of the Earth that is very
small compared to the radius of the Earth. [Hint: You may
take the acceleration due to gravity as essentially the same as
that on the surface.] Does your result depend on the mass
of the satellite?
53. (II) What is the apparent weight of a 75-kg astronaut
2500 km from the center of the Moon in a space vehicle
(a) moving at constant velocity and (b) accelerating toward
the Moon at 
State “direction” in each case.
54. (II) A Ferris wheel 22.0 m in diameter rotates once every
12.5 s (see Fig. 5–9
