reases metabolic activity, heart rate and
alertness. The activation of the endocrine system by the
nervous system has been positively selected by survival in
response to threat.
C. Describe a model for the evolution of the activation of
immune system by the nervous system in an environment
in which wounds are frequent and potentially lethal.
Include the selection process in your description.
In the famous experiment of Pavlov, a reward
(unconditioned stimulus) received synchronously with a
bell (conditioned stimulus) became associated in the mind
of the dog. After a few repetitions, the response of the dog
to the bell was to drool. The digestive system had been
activated by the nervous system through a conditioned
stimulus.
An emerging area of research is psychoneuroimmunology,
the study of the relationship between the immune system
and the nervous system. Exton and co-workers (Brain
Behavioral Research, 110, 2000) have shown that a reward
(an injection of epinephrine) received synchro
