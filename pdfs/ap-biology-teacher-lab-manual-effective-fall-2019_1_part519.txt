is crucial. Unless you are confident that students can make this transfer successfully, 
consider adding the plasmid to the transformation suspensions yourself. Look carefully 
at the loop to see if there is a film of plasmid solution across the ring, similar to seeing 
a soapy film across a ring for blowing soap bubbles. Do not add more plasmid than 
is recommended in the procedure — unless students want to do a little independent 
investigating about the relationship between the amount of plasmid and the efficiency 
of transformation of E. coli. Over-saturating the cell solution with DNA decreases the 
transformation efficiency. 
Impatient students often skip steps in the procedure or fail to read instructions 
carefully. In this investigation, they must adhere to the instructions unless they are 
conducting an independent experiment on the effect(s) of varying the transformation 
procedure. The “heat shock” procedure increases the bacterial uptake of foreign DNA, 
and the rapid temp
