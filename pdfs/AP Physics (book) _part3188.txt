Holography
FIGURE 28–24 Making a hologram. Light
reflected from various points on the object
interferes (at the film) with light from the
direct beam.

eye surgery.
Standard DVDs use a thinner track 
and shorter pit length (400 nm).
Blu-ray discs use a “blue” laser with a short wavelength (405 nm) and narrower
beam, allowing a narrower track 
that can store much more data for 
high definition. DVDs can also have two layers, one below the other. When 
the laser focuses on the second layer, the light passes through the semitransparent
surface layer. The second layer may start reading at the outer edge instead of
inside. DVDs can also have a single or double layer on both surfaces of the disc.
Lasers are a useful surgical tool. The narrow intense beam can be used to
destroy tissue in a localized area, or to break up gallstones and kidney stones.
Because of the heat produced, a laser beam can be used to “weld” broken tissue,
such as a detached retina, Fi
