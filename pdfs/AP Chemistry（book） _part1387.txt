 domain. Because the domains from nonbonding pairs exert larger 
repulsions than those from bonding pairs, nonbonding domains always occupy the 
equatorial positions in a trigonal bipyramid.
Give It Some Thought
It might seem that a square-planar geometry of four electron domains around a 
central atom would be more favorable than a tetrahedron. Can you rationalize why 
the tetrahedron is preferred, based on angles between electron domains?
The most stable electron-domain geometry for six electron domains is the octahedron. 
An octahedron is a polyhedron with six vertices and eight faces, each an equilateral trian-
gle. An atom with six electron domains around it can be visualized as being at the center 
of the octahedron with the electron domains pointing toward the six vertices, as shown 
in Table 9.3. All the bond angles are 90Â°, and all six vertices are equivalent. Therefore, if an 
atom has five bonding electron domains and one nonbonding domain, we can put the 
nonbonding domain
