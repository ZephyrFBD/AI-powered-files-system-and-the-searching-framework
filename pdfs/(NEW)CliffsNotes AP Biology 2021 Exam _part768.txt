odine and potassium iodide, or

Part III: Observing Osmosis in a Living Cell
Cells contain water and various solutes. As a result, the cell has a negative solute potential and pure water (water
potential = 0) will enter the cell because water moves from higher to lower pressure potentials. In many plant cells,
the water and solutes are stored in the central vacuole. As water enters the cell, the vacuole expands until the
pressure, called turgor pressure, exerts a force on the cell wall. In a mature cell, the cell wall cannot stretch and
expand. Thus, in a healthy cell, when the cell is fully expanded, the cell wall presses back with a pressure equal to
and opposite of the turgor pressure.
In part II of this investigation, you determined the direction of osmosis across a dialysis bag, a cell model. This part
of the investigation repeats the investigation for real cells.
First, you observe a plant cell, such as the aquati
