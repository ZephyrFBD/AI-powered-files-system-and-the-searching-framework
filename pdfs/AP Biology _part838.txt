 the gene that was inserted into the plasmid. To force a
bacterium to uptake a plasmid, the bacterium must be prepared in a special
way. It must be made competent.
Objective
Cut lambda DNA with different restriction enzymes. Transform bacteria
into an antibiotic-resistant form by inserting a plasmid.
To transform bacteria, first make them competent to uptake a plasmid.
Use heat shock, a combination of alternating hot and cold, in the presence
of calcium ions that disrupt the cell membrane. Once competent, the
bacteria should be incubated with plasmids that carry the resistance to a
particular antibiotic. A control sample should be run along with the

experimental one, treated in exactly the same way except it does not get
exposed to a plasmid. After the cells are allowed to rest, they should be
poured onto four Petri dishes that contain Luria broth. Two Petri dishes
should also contain antibiotic, and two should not. Table 19.2 shows
