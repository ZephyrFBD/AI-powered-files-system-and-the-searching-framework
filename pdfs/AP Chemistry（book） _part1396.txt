ual in magnitude. A plot of the molecule’s electron density clearly 
shows that the individual bonds are polar, but what can we say about the overall dipole 
moment of the molecule?
Bond dipoles and dipole moments are vector quantities; that is, they have both a mag-
nitude and a direction. The dipole moment of a polyatomic molecule is the vector sum 
of its bond dipoles. Both the magnitudes and the directions of the bond dipoles must 
be considered when summing vectors. The two bond dipoles in CO2, although equal 
in magnitude, are opposite in direction. Adding them is the same as adding two num-
bers that are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, such as 100 + 1-1002. The bond 
dipoles, like the numbers, “cancel” each other. Therefore, the dipole moment of CO2 is 
zero, even though the individual bonds are polar. The geometry of the molecule dictates 
that the overall dipole moment be zero, making CO2 a nonpolar molecule.
Now let’s consider H2O, a bent molecule with two polar bond
