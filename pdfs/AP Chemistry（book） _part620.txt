cular solute in a solution, chemists often carry 
out a titration, which involves combining a solution where the solute concentration is not 
known with a reagent solution of known concentration, called a standard solution. Just 
enough standard solution is added to completely react with the solute in the solution 
of unknown concentration. The point at which stoichiometrically equivalent quantities 
are brought together is known as the equivalence point.
Titrations can be conducted using neutralization, precipitation, or oxidation-reduction 
reactions. Figure 4.18 illustrates a typical neutralization titration, one between an HCl solu-
tion of unknown concentration and a standard NaOH solution. To determine the HCl con-
centration, we first add a specific volume of the HCl solution, 20.0 mL in this example, to 
a flask. Next we add a few drops of an acid–base indicator. The acid–base indicator is a 
dye that changes color on passing the equivalence point.* For example, the dye phenol-
