eans “to split.” These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear
membranes. Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins, and ribonucleases
(RNAses) that break down RNA. The DNA is then precipitated using alcohol. Human genomic DNA is usually visible as a
gelatinous, white mass. The DNA samples can be stored frozen at –80°C for several years.

Figure 17.2 This diagram shows the basic method used for extraction of DNA.
RNA analysis is performed to study gene expression patterns in cells. RNA is naturally very unstable because RNAses are
commonly present in nature and very difficult to inactivate. Similar to DNA, RNA extraction involves the use of various
buffers and enzymes to inactivate macromolecules and preserve the RNA.
Gel Electrophoresis
Because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic pH in an aqueous environment, they can be mobilized
by an elect
