limited to the surface of the metal, as is the case with the green coating 
that forms on copper roofs and statues. In other instances, the corrosion goes deeper, eventu-
ally compromising the structural integrity of the metal, as happens with the rusting of iron.
Corrosion is the conversion of a metal into a metal compound, by a reaction between 
the metal and some substance in its environment. When a metal corrodes, each metal 
atom loses one or more electrons to form a cation, which can combine with an anion to 
form an ionic compound. The green coating on the Statue of Liberty contains Cu2+ com-
bined with carbonate and hydroxide anions; rust contains Fe3+ combined with oxide 
and hydroxide anions; and silver tarnish contains Ag+ combined with sulfide anions.
When an atom, ion, or molecule becomes more positively charged (that is, when 
it loses electrons), we say that it has been oxidized. Loss of electrons by a substance is
