to a smaller f-stop number. The smaller the f-stop
number, the larger the opening and the more light passes through the lens to the
sensor or film. The smallest f-number of a lens (largest opening) is referred to as
the speed of the lens. The best lenses may have a speed of 
, or even faster.
The advantage of a fast lens is that it allows pictures to be taken under poor
lighting conditions. Good quality lenses consist of several elements to reduce the
defects present in simple thin lenses (Section 25–6). Standard f-stops are
1.0, 1.4, 2.0, 2.8, 4.0, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, and 32
(Fig. 25–5). Each of these stops corresponds to a diameter reduction by a factor of
Because the amount of light reaching the film is proportional to the 
area of the opening, and therefore proportional to the diameter squared, each
standard f-stop corresponds to a factor of 2 change in light intensity reaching 
the film.
