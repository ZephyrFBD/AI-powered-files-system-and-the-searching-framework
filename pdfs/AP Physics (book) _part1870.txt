tor changes at
the same frequency as the sound wave.
Some computer keyboards operate by capacitance. As shown in Fig. 17–17,
each key is connected to the upper plate of a capacitor. The upper plate moves
down when the key is pressed, reducing the spacing between the capacitor plates,
and increasing the capacitance (Eq. 17–8: smaller d, larger C). The change
in capacitance results in an electric signal that is detected by an electronic 
circuit.
