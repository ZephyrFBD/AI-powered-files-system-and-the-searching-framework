48. Which of the following is a valid interpretation  
of the experimental results that explains how 
individuals with type 2 diabetes differ from 
individuals without diabetes? 
(A) The relatively low levels of glucose uptake in 
individuals with type 2 diabetes indicate 
that mobilization of GLUT4 to the cell 
surface is reduced in muscle cells of those 
individuals. 
(B) The relatively low levels of glucose uptake in 
individuals with type 2 diabetes indicate 
that no functional GLUT4 protein is 
produced in the muscle cells of those 
individuals. 
(C) The absence of activated insulin receptors in 
individuals with type 2 diabetes indicates 
that no insulin is secreted by the pancreatic 
cells of those individuals. 
(D) The absence of a
