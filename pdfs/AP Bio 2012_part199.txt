 with an 
appropriate justification.
Descriptions may include:
• 
Anacharis is adapted to an environment where transpiration does not 
occur, such as underwater or in 100 percent humidity. There is no need for 
water vapor or it cannot occur via transpiration. 
• 
Water lilies are adapted to an environment where only the upper side of 
the leaf is exposed to air; thus, only one surface can exchange water vapor 
with the environment. The large number of stomata is not a disadvantage 
because the plant has easy access to water. 
• 
Black walnut is adapted to an environment where the upper surface is 
exposed to strong sunlight and higher temperatures and/or where water is 
more limited compared to a watery environment. Stomata located on lower 
epidermis of leaves are shaded from exposure to direct sunlight and higher 
temperatures, mitigating excessive water loss.
