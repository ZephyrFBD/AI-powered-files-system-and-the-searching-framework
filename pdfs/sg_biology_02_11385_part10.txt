pecial regard to temperature, a student 
who demonstrated an understanding that the activity curve was different from a temperature curve or that 
mammal physiology, unlike that of ectotherms, is typically insensitive to temperature could earn an 
elaboration point. 
 
 
2. (b) 
A maximum of 7 points 
 
Hypothesis (1 point) 
The student was required to indicate that a CHANGE in the light (intensity, duration, wavelength) causes 
a CHANGE in the cycle of activity or biorhythm. There also could be a prediction of a change of light 
having no effect on the cycle of activity. Like the description of the curve above, the hypothesis 
statement had to be clearly distinguishable from the rest of the answer and not simply implied in another 
part of the response. The student may have failed to earn this point if the experiment he/she designed 
below clearly used a different light characteristic (independent variable), and/or produces a different 
result (dependent variable) from the ones indica
