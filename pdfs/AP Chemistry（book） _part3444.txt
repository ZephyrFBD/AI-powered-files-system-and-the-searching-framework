clear reactions. 
Nuclei that spontaneously change by emitting radiation are said 
to be radioactive. Radioactive nuclei are called radionuclides, and 
the atoms containing them are called radioisotopes. Radionuclides 
spontaneously change through a process called radioactive decay. 
The three most important types of radiation given off as a result 
of radioactive decay are alpha 1A2  particles 14
2He or a2, beta 1B2 
particles 1 0
-1e or b-2, and gamma 1G2  radiation 10
0g or g2. Positrons

+1e or b+2, which are particles with the same mass as an electron 
but the opposite charge, can also be produced when a radioiso-
tope decays.
In nuclear equations, reactant and product nuclei are repre-
sented by giving their mass numbers and atomic numbers, as well 
as their chemical symbol. The totals of the mass numbers on both 
sides of the equation are equal; the totals of the atomic numbers on 
both sides are also equal. There are four common modes of radio-
active decay: alpha emission,
