16. Based on the data above, what is the most likely mechanism for ascorbate’s effect on mutagenesis?
(A) Ascorbate likely causes mutations along with nitrosamines.
(B) Ascorbate likely inhibits an enzyme that converts nitrates to nitrosamines.
(C) Ascorbate likely enhances the interaction between nitrosamines and DNA.
(D) Ascorbate activates the genes that are mutated to be expressed.
17. Examine the figure below. If each arrow represents a division in mitosis, what can be said about the
amount of genetic material in the G1 phase in cell 1 compared to the G1 phase in cell 5?
(A) Cell 1 has ¼ the amount of genetic material as cell 5.
(B) Cell 1 has ⅓ the amount of genetic material as cell 5.
(C) Cell 1 has the same amount of genetic material as cell 5.
(D) Cell 1 has twice the amount of genetic material as cell 5.
