ed, but this is an artificial setup that doesnâ€™t quite mimic the natural environment.
c. Describe the brood size(s) in which 100% of the offspring survive. Identify which brood size has the highest
percent of mortality. (2 points)
For a brood size of 3, it shows that 3 offspring survive, so 100%. For a brood size of 5, only 3 survive. 3/5 is the
least surviving percentage, so a brood size of 5 has the highest mortality percentage.
d. Over many more years the number of breeding adults was measured, and it was found that over a long time the
number of breeding adults averaged around 100. Describe how this would change information in Figure 1.
Justify your answer. (3 points)
It would not change Figure 1, which measures only the percentage of surviving offspring per brood size. If the
number of surviving offspring were counted, then the information could be put on Figure 2, but just the number of
mating adults is not enough for Figure 1 or Figure 2.
