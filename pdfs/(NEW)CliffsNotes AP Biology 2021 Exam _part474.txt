wed by invagination of the plasma membrane). Note that replication of DNA in prokaryotes occurs
during cell division, whereas in eukaryotes it occurs when the cell is not dividing (interphase).
3. C. The conversion of nitrite (NO2−) to nitrate (NO3−) is performed by
 
nitrifying bacteria.
 
4. B. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria convert nitrogen gas (N2) to ammonia (NH3).
 
5. D. Photosynthetic, purple sulfur bacteria split H2S to obtain electrons
 
and H+ for noncyclic photophosphorylation. When H2S is split, sulfur
 
(S) is produced. This is analogous to the splitting of H2O during photosynthesis by cyanobacteria, algae, and plants,
which produces O2
 
as an end product.
6. B. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria live in nodules, specialized regions of plant roots. The bacteria and the plants have a
mutualistic relationship, in which the bacteria provide the plants with fixed nitrogen in exchange for sugars.
7. A. Heterotrophic bacteria, such as decomposers, obtain their energy from the organic molecule
