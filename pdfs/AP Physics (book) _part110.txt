where g is the
acceleration due to gravity and, like all accelerations, has dimensions 
(Do not worry about these formulas—the correct one will be derived in 
Chapter 11; what we are concerned about here is a person’s recalling whether it
contains

is correct:
whereas the latter 
is not:
The constant 
has no dimensions and so can’t be checked using dimensions.
