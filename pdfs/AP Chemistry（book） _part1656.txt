10.24  An open-end manometer containing mercury is connected 
to a container of gas, as depicted in Sample Exercise 10.2. 
What is the pressure of the enclosed gas in torr in each of the 
following situations? (a) The mercury in the arm attached 
to the gas is 15.4 mm higher than in the one open to the at-
mosphere; atmospheric pressure is 0.985 atm. (b) The mer-
cury in the arm attached to the gas is 12.3 mm lower than in 
the one open to the atmosphere; atmospheric pressure is 
0.99 atm.
The Gas Laws (Section 10.3)
10.25  You have a gas at 25 Â°C confined to a cylinder with a mov-
able piston. Which of the following actions would double 
the gas pressure? (a) Lifting up on the piston to double the 
volume while keeping the temperature constant; (b) Heat-
ing the gas so that its temperature rises from
