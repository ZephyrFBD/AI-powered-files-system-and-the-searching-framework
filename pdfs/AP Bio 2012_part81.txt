The 2013 AP Biology Exam is approximately 3 hours in length. There are two 
sections, each accounting for 50 percent of the student’s AP Exam score. 
• Section I is 90 minutes long and consists of 63 multiple-choice questions 
and 6 grid-in questions. 
• Section II is 90 minutes long and consists of 2 long free-response 
questions and 6 short free-response questions. It begins with a 10-minute 
reading period for students to read the questions and plan their answers. 
The remaining 80 minutes is for responding to the questions. 
All of the questions on the exam are designed to measure the student’s 
understanding of the big ideas, enduring understandings, and essential 
knowledge, and the student’s application of this understanding through the 
science practices.
