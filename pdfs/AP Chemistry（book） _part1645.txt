THE KINETIC-MOLECULAR THEORY OF GASES (SECTION 10.7)  The 
kinetic-molecular theory of gases accounts for the properties of an ideal gas 
in terms of a set of statements about the nature of gases. Briefly, these 
statements are as follows: Molecules are in continuous chaotic motion. 
The volume of gas molecules is negligible compared to the volume of their 
container. The gas molecules neither attract nor repel each other. The av-
erage kinetic energy of the gas molecules is proportional to the absolute 
temperature and does not change if the temperature remains constant.
The individual molecules of a gas do not all have the same ki-
netic energy at a given instant. Their speeds are distributed over a 
wide range; the distribution varies with the molar mass of the gas 
and with temperature. The root-mean-square (rms) speed, urms, varies 
in proportion to the square root of the absolute temperature and in-
versely with the square root of th
