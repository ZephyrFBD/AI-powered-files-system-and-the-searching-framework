elative amounts of the 
three gases in the starting mixture and then analyze each equilibrium mixture, we could 
determine the relationship among the equilibrium concentrations.

CHAPTER 15 Chemical Equilibrium
Chemists carried out studies of this kind on other chemical systems in the nine-
teenth century before Haber’s work. In 1864, Cato Maximilian Guldberg (1836–1902) 
and Peter Waage (1833–1900) postulated their law of mass action, which expresses, for 
any reaction, the relationship between the concentrations of the reactants and products 
present at equilibrium. Suppose we have the general equilibrium equation
 
a A + b B ∆ d D + e E 
[15.7]
where A, B, D, and E are the chemical species involved and a, b, d, and e are their coeffi-
cients in the balanced chemical equation. According to the law of mass action, the equi-
librium condition is described by the expression
