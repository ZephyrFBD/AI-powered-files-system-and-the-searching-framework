it to a total volume of 0.500 L, what will 
be the concentration of the final solution?
 4.74 (a) How many milliliters of a stock solution of 6.0 M HNO3 
would you have to use to prepare 110 mL of 0.500 M HNO3? 
(b) If you dilute 10.0 mL of the stock solution to a final volume of 
0.250 L, what will be the concentration of the diluted solution?
 4.75 A medical lab is testing a new anticancer drug on cancer cells. 
The drug stock solution concentration is 1.5 * 10-9 M, and 
1.00 mL of this solution will be delivered to a dish containing 
2.0 * 105 cancer cells in 5.00 mL of aqueous fluid. What is the 
ratio of drug molecules to the number of cancer cells in the 
dish?
 4.76 Calicheamicin gamma-1, C55H74IN3O21S4, is one of the most 
potent antibiotics known: one molecule kills one bacterial 
cell. Describe how you would (carefully!) prepare 25.00 mL 
of an aqueous calicheamicin gamma-1 solution that could 
kill 1.0 * 108 bacteria, starting from a 5.00 * 10-9M stock 
solution of the antib
