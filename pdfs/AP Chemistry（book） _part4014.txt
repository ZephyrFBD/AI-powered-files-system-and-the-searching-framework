7.79 Up to Z = 82, there are three instances where atomic weights 
are reversed relative to atomic numbers: Ar and K; Co and Ni; Te 
 
and I. 7.81 (a) 5+ (b) 4.8+ (c) Shielding is greater for 3p electrons, 
owing to penetration by 3s electrons, so Zeff for 3p electrons is less 
than that for 3s electrons. (d) The ﬁrst electron lost is a 3p electron 
because it has a smaller Zeff and experiences less attraction for the 
nucleus than a 3s electron does. 7.85 (a) The As—Cl distance is 2.24 
Å. (b) The predicted As—Cl bond length is 2.21 Å 7.87 (a) Chalco-
gens, -2; halogens, -1. (b) The family with the larger value is: atomic 
radii, chalcogens; ionic radii of the most common oxidation state, 
chalcogens; ﬁrst ionization energy, halogens; second ionization 
energy, halogens 7.91 C : 1s22s22p2. I1 through I4 represent loss of 
the 2p and 2s elec
