a.
The osmolarity would decrease, allowing the
interstitial fluid to reabsorb solutes.
b.
The osmolarity would decrease, allowing the
interstitial fluid to reabsorb water.
c.
The osmolarity would increase, allowing the
interstitial fluid to reabsorb solutes.
d.
The osmolarity would increase, allowing the
interstitial fluid to reabsorb water.

excretory system, or protonephridia, consists of two
tubules connected to a highly branched tube system. The
intake end of the tubes contain cilia that propel waste
matter down the tubules and out of the body through
