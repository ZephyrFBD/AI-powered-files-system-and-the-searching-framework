This resource introduces students to the concepts of cellular respiration. By walking 
through the still images and movie included for each topic, students are in control of 
choosing the learning style that best fits their needs. 
■ Procedural Resources 
AP Biology Lab Manual, Lab 5: Cell Respiration, The College Board, 2001. 
Although this laboratory protocol is teacher directed, students can use the resource to 
glean information about the process of cellular respiration as they design experiments 
to investigate factors, including environmental variables such as temperature, that 
affect the rate of respiratio
