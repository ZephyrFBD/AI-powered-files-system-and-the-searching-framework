CHAPTER 11
Oscillations and Waves
FIGURE 11–6 Example 11–6.
A spider waits for its prey (on the left).
EXERCISE D By how much should the mass on the end of a spring be changed to halve
the frequency of its oscillations? (a) No change; (b) doubled; (c) quadrupled; (d) halved;
(e) quartered.
Spider web. A spider of mass 0.30 g waits in
its web of negligible mass (Fig. 11–6). A slight movement causes the web to
vibrate with a frequency of about 15 Hz. (a) Estimate the value of the spring
stiffness constant k for the web. (b) At what frequency would you expect the web
to vibrate if an insect of mass 0.10 g were trapped in addition to the spider?
APPROACH We can only make a rough estimate because a spider’s web is
fairly complicated and may vibrate with a mixture of frequencies. We use SHM
as an approximate model.
SOLUTION (a) The frequency of SHM is given by
