eup. The diﬀerences depend on which genes are
expressed and which are not. Gene expression is controlled primarily
by transcription factors. The diﬀerence between nerve cells and
smooth muscle cells, for example, lies in the fact that there are
diﬀerent transcription factors present in nerve cells than what is
present in smooth muscle cells. As a result, diﬀerent genes are
expressed in diﬀerent cells. (B) correctly summarizes this concept.
Since mitosis produces cells with identical nuclei, (A) is incorrect. Cell
diﬀerentiation is not a random process, so (C) is incorrect. (D) is
incorrect because cells develop as organisms grow; cells do not evolve.

The repressor may bind to the wildtype operator on the plasmid, but
the operator upstream of the structural genes is still not blocked. Thus,
the bacterial cells will continually express the lac operon. The correct
answer is (C). (A) is incorrect because the binding of the repressor to
the wildtype operator do
