from a nitrogen atom?

It may seem odd that 4s electrons are removed before 3d electrons in forming tran-
sition-metal cations. After all, in writing electron configurations, we added the 4s elec-
trons before the 3d ones. In writing electron configurations for atoms, however, we are 
going through an imaginary process in which we move through the periodic table from 
one element to another. In doing so, we are adding both an electron to an orbital and 
a proton to the nucleus to change the identity of the element. In ionization, we do not
