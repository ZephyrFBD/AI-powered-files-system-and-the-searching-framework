lants in all. Third, he
applied statistical analysis to his carefully collected data.
Until the nineteenth century, people thought that inheritance was
blended, a mixture of fluids that passed from parents to children. In
contrast, Mendelâ€™s theory of genetics is one of particulate inheritance in
which inherited characteristics are carried by discrete units that he called
elementes. These elementes eventually became known as genes.
BASICS OF PROBABILITY
Probability is the likelihood that a particular event will happen. If an event
is an absolute certainty, its probability is 1. If the event cannot happen, its
probability is 0. The probability of anything else happening is between 0
and 1. Probability cannot predict whether a particular event will actually
occur. However, if the sample is large enough, probability can predict an
average outcome.
Understanding probability is important to the study of genetics because
predicting outcomes is what Punnett squares enable us to do. What is the
