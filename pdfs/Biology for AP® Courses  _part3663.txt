finity for oxygen decreases due to its
decreasing ability to bind oxygen.
d.
As the percent saturation of hemoglobin
decreases, hemoglobinâ€™s affinity for oxygen
increases as the availability of oxygen decreases.

The graph shows an oxygen dissociation curve for
hemoglobin. Based on the graph, what would likely cause
the curve to shift to the left, as shown by the dotted plot
line?
a.
a decrease in carbon dioxide, increase in pH, or
a decrease in temperature
b.
an increase in carbon dioxide, increase in pH, or
a decrease in temperature
c.
a decrease in carbon dioxide, decrease in pH, or
a decrease in temperature
d.
a decrease in carbon dioxide, increase in pH, or
an increase in temperature
