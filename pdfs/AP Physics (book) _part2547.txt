Foot appears to be here

FIGURE 23–22 (a) Photograph, and (b) ray diagram
showing why a person’s legs look shorter standing in
water: a ray from the bather’s foot to the observer’s 
eye bends at the water’s surface, and our brain
interprets the light as traveling in a straight line,
from higher up (dashed line).
Refraction is responsible for a number of common optical illusions. For example,
a person standing in waist-deep water appears to have shortened legs (Fig. 23–22).
The rays leaving the person’s foot are bent at the surface. The observer’s brain
assumes the rays to have traveled a straight-line path (dashed red line), and so the feet
appear to be higher than they really are. Similarly, when you put a straw in water, it
appears to be bent (Fig.23–23). This also means that water is deeper than it appears.
