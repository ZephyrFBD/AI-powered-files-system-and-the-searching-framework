he year is equally important.
2. Latitude is strongly correlated with climate, but it also determines solar energy exposure. Solar energy exposure
controls the extent of photosynthesis and the biomass of the primary producers. Areas at the equator receive more
solar energy than those at the poles. Also, because seasonal variations are minimized at lower latitudes (regions
close to the equator), more constant environmental conditions are often able to support more species.
Tropical ecosystems are highly diverse, having many species but with smaller numbers of each species. In contrast,
polar ecosystems have few species but with many individuals of those species.
3. Habitat size and diversity influence how many different kinds of organisms can be supported. The larger an
ecosystem, the more likely that it contains greater kinds of soil texture, soil chemistry, and variations in the slope of
the terrain. More diverse habitats support a greater variety of species.
4. Elevation also influen
