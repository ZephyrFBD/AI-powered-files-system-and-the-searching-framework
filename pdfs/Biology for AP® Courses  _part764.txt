supports the plantâ€™s weight. Plant cells become water
deficient because their cells use the water for metabolic
processes. What happens to the metabolism of a plant that
does not have adequate water?

a.
Photosynthesis is inhibited, less glucose is
produced, and water used by the cells is not
replaced.
b.
The plant increases its breakdown of glucose to
create more water at the end of the process.
c.
The plant will stop photosynthesizing for long
periods of time until it has enough water to do
so.
d.
The cell will bring in more CO2 , to compensate
for the lack of water, allowing glucose synthesis
to continue.
55. Enzymes facilitate chemical reactions that result in
changes to a substrate. How does the induced fit model of
enzymes and substrates explain their function?
a.
Both enzyme and substrate undergo dynamic
changes, inducing the transitions state of the
substrate.
b.
The
