ator and then enclosed by a cylindrical
conductor (shield) carrying the return current. Why is a
“shield” necessary?
10. What is the advantage of placing the two insulated electric
wires carrying ac close together or even twisted about each
other?
11. Explain why, exactly, the lights may dim briefly when a
refrigerator motor starts up. When an electric heater is
turned on, the lights may stay dimmed as long as the heater
is on. Explain the difference.
12. Use Figs. 21–14 and 21–17 plus the right-hand rules to show
why the counter torque in a generator opposes the motion.
13. Will an eddy current brake (Fig. 21–20) work on a copper
or aluminum wheel, or must the wheel be ferromagnetic?
Explain.
6. Suppose you are looking along a line through the centers of
two circular (but separate) wire loops, one behind the other.
A battery is suddenly connected to the front loop, establish-
ing a clockwise current. (a) Will a current be induced in the
second loop? (b) If so, when does this current s
