25. The large alpha male elephant seal is constantly
fending off the advances of medium sized males. Small
males are then able to sneak copulation with females and
successfully pass on their genes. What is this an example
of? Explain.

a.
This is an example of sexual selection. The
females are selecting the small males over the
large male.
b.
This is an example of genetic drift. Because
there are so many medium-sized males to
compete with the large alpha male, the small
males are able to mate and cause the gene pool
to shift towards smaller individuals.
c.
This is an example of positive frequency-
dependent selection, which is selection that
favors phenotypes that are either common or
rare. The sneaky males (rare)
