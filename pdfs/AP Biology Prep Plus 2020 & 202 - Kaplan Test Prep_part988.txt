d) Explain how pepsin aids in the digestion of proteins in the
stomach. (1 point)
Explanation (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The stomach is very acidic, which is the optimum pH of pepsin. Pepsin
lowers the activation energy required to breakdown proteins, thus
speeding up the reaction. Enzymes do not get used up in a reaction, so
they can catalyze millions of reactions per second.
The optimum pH of chymotrypsin is about 7.5
Pepsin speeds up the reaction of protein digestion.
