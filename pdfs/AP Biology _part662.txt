of muscles focuses on skeletal muscles; see Figure 15.8.

individual cylindrical muscle cells. Each cell is exceptionally large and
multinucleate. Skeletal muscle consists of modified structures that enable
the cell to contract.
STUDY TIP
Thin filaments = actin
Thick filaments = myosin
The sarcolemma is modified plasma membrane that surrounds
each muscle fiber and can propagate an action potential.
The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is modified endoplasmic
reticulum that contains sacs of Ca++ necessary for normal muscle
contraction.
The T system is a system of tubules that runs perpendicular to the
SR and that connects the SR to the extracellular fluid.
The sarcomere is the functional unit of t
