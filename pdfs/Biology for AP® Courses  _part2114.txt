 mammals tend to get cancer more frequently
than larger mammals, scientists discovered that larger mammals have had fewer ERVs invade their genome. Because
retroviral integration is associated with cancer, results from this research suggest the possibility that larger mammals are
able to control EVR replication until they reach post-reproductive age.

In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What is population genetics and how is population genetics a synthesis of Mendelian inheritance and Darwinian
evolution?
•
What is the Hardy–Weinberg principle, and how can it be applied to micro
