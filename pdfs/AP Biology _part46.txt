A fatty acid is a hydrocarbon chain with a carboxyl group at one end.
Fatty acids exist in two varieties, saturated and unsaturated, as shown in
Figure 2.8.
Figure 2.8 Fatty Acids
In general, saturated fats come from animals, are solid at room
temperature, and when ingested in large quantities, are linked to heart
disease. An example of a saturated fat is butter. Saturated fatty acids
contain only single bonds between carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids,
in general, are extracted from plants, are liquid at room temperature, and
are considered to be healthy dietary fats. Unsaturated fatty acids have at
least one double bond formed by the removal of hydrogen atoms in the
carbon skeleton. As a result, they ho
