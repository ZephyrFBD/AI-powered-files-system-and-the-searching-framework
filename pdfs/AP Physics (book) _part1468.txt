Fahrenheit degrees. Kelvins are
related to °C by
When two objects at different temperatures are placed in
contact, they eventually reach the same temperature and are
then said to be in thermal equilibrium.
The change in length,
of a solid, when its temperature
changes by an amount 
is directly proportional to the 
temperature change and to its original length 
That is,
(13–1a)
where 
is the coefficient of linear expansion.
The change in volume of most solids, liquids, and gases is
proportional to the temperature change and to the original
volume
(13–2)
The coefficient of volume expansion,
is approximately equal
to 
for uniform solids.
Water is unusual because, unlike most materials whose
volume increases with temperature, its volume in the range from
0°C to 4°C actually decreases as the temperature increases.
The ideal gas law, or equation of state for an ideal gas,
relates the pressure P, volume V, and temperature T (in kelvins)
of n moles of gas by the equation
(13–3)
where
