n:
201 + 0 = A
Thus, the product nucleus must have a mass number of 201. 
Similarly, balancing the atomic numbers gives
80 - 1 = Z
Thus, the atomic number of the product nucleus must be 79, 
which identiﬁes it as gold (Au):

(b) In this case, we must determine what type of particle is emit-
ted in the course of the radioactive decay:
231
90Th ¡ 231
91Pa + A
ZX
From 231 = 231 + A and 90 = 91 + Z, we deduce A = 0 and 
Z = -1. According to Table 21.2, the particle with these char-
acteristics is the beta particle (electron). We therefore write
231

91Pa +

▶Practice Exercise 1
The radioactive decay of thorium-232 occurs in multiple 
steps, called a radioactive decay chain. The second product 
produced in this chain is actinium-228. Which of the fol-
lowing processes could lead to this product starting with 
thorium-232?
(a) Alpha decay followed by beta emission
(b) Beta emission followed by electron capture
(c) Positr
