 The barman is doing a crossword puzzle and he says to Peter,What’s 
 
 the opposite of advance? 
 
 Retreat, says Peter. 
 
 That’s it, says the barman. Everything has an opposite. 
 
 Mother o’ God, says Peter. 
 
 What’s up with you, Peter? says the barman. 
 
 What was that you said before,Tommy? 
 
 Everything has an opposite. 
 
 Mother o’ God. 
 
 Are you all right, Peter? Is the pint all right? 
 
 The pint is grand, Tommy, and I’m the champion of all pint 
 
 drinkers, amn’t I? 
 
 Begod an’ you are, Peter. No denyin’ that to you. 
 
 That means I could be the champion in the opposite department. 
 
 What are you talking about, Peter? 
 
 I could be the champion of no pints at all. 
 
 Ah, now, Peter, I think you’re going a bit far. Is the wife all right at
