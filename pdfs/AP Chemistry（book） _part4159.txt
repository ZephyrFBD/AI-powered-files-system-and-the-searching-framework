n pure acetic acid leads us to conclude that 
it will be a strongly hydrogen-bonded substance. That the melting 
and boiling points of pure acetic acid are both higher than those 
of water, a substance we know to be strongly hydrogen-bonded, 
supports this conclusion. 24.55 (a) CH3CH2CH2CH1OH2CH3

(b) In protein formation, amino acids undergo a condensation reac-
tion between the amino group of one molecule and the carboxylic 
acid group of another to form the amide linkage. (c) The bond that 
links amino acids in proteins is called the peptide bond. It is shown in 
bold in the Ô¨Ågure below.

page 5 (a) 100 (b) atoms page 10 Water is composed of two 
types of atoms: hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is composed 
only of hydrogen atoms, and oxygen is composed only of oxygen 
atoms. Therefore, hydrogen and oxygen are
