Answers to Selected Practice Exercises
Sample Exercise 23.5
Practice Exercise 2: No, because the complex is flat. This complex ion 
does, however, have geometric isomers (for example, the Cl and Br 
ligands could be cis or trans).
Sample Exercise 23.6
Practice Exercise 2: Green, because it absorbs the green’s complimen-
tary color, red. 
Sample Exercise 23.7
Practice Exercise 2: 3Co1NH325
 
 Cl42 + is purple which means it must 
absorb light near the boundary between the yellow and green regions 
of the spectrum. 3Co1NH32643+ is orange which means it absorbs blue 
light. Because yellow-green photons have a lower energy (longer 
wavelength) than blue photons, ∆ is smaller for 3Co1NH325Cl
