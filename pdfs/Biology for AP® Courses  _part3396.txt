CHAPTER SUMMARY
28.1 Types of Hormones
There are three basic types of hormones: lipid-derived, amino acid-derived, and peptide. Lipid-derived hormones are
structurally similar to cholesterol and include steroid hormones such as estradiol and testosterone. Amino acid-derived
hormones are relatively small molecules and include the adrenal hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. Peptide
hormones are polypeptide chains or proteins and include the pituitary hormones, antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin), and
oxytocin.
28.2 How Hormones Work
Hormones cause cellular changes by binding to receptors on target cells. The number of receptors on a target cell can
increase or decrease in response to hormone activity. Hormones can affect cells directly through intracellular hormone
receptors or indirec
