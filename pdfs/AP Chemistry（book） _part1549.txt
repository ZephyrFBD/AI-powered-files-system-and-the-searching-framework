r, solid ice, or water vapor.
Even though different gaseous substances may have very different chemical prop-
erties, they behave quite similarly as far as their physical properties are concerned. For 
example, the N2 and O2 that account for approximately 99% of our atmosphere have 
very different chemical properties—O2 supports human life but N2 does not, to name 
just one difference—but these two components of air behave physically as one gaseous 
material because their physical properties are essentially identical.
The physical properties of gases differ significantly from those of solids and liquids. 
For example, a gas expands spontaneously to fill its container. Consequently, the volume 
of a gas equals the volume of its container. Gases also are highly compressible: When 
pressure is applied to a gas, its volume readily decreases. Solids and liquids, on the other 
hand, do not expand to fill their containers and are not readily compressible.
Two or more gases form a homogeneous
