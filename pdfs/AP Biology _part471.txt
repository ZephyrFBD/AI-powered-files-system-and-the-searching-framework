Primitive Earth provided inorganic precursors from which organic
molecules could have been synthesized. There was no free oxygen
present when Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago.
There have been five major extinctions.
PRACTICE QUESTIONS
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited disease in
Caucasian populations. One out of 2,500 newborn infants has the
disease, with a calculated carrier frequency of 1 in 25. The disease is
caused by an autosomal recessive allele. Until recently, cystic
fibrosis was nearly always lethal at a young age. The frequency of
the CF gene has caused people to speculate for many years as to
why it persists at such high levels in the gene pool. When you have a
gene that codes for a fatal disorder, you expect the numbers in the
population to decrease. However, this has not happened with CF. In
terms of evolution, which of the following is the best explanation for
why the CF gene has persisted at such high frequency?
The g
