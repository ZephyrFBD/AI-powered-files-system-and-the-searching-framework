oxyl group (COOH).
Generally, all peptides will have an end with an amino group, called the N-terminus or amino terminus, in addition
to an end with a carboxyl group, called C-terminus or carboxyl terminus. Based on the specific way that two amino
acids bond, two different dipeptides can result. For example, both dipeptides above have the same amino acids.
However, one has glycine at the N-terminus and alanine at the C-terminus, whereas the other has alanine at the N-
terminus and glycine at the C-terminus.
Higher Protein Structure
The polypeptide has to go through several changes before it can officially be called a protein. Proteins can have four
levels of structure. The linear sequence of the amino acids is called the primary structure of a protein. Now the
polypeptide begins to twist, forming either a coil (known as an alpha helix) or zigzagging pattern (known as beta-
pleated sheets). These are examples of proteinsâ€™ secondary structures.
A polypeptide folds and twists because the
