ntrate better on the test. If you
have ever taken yoga classes, you probably know some other good relaxation techniques. Use them when you
can (obviously, anything that requires leaving your seat and, say, assuming a handstand position won’t be
allowed by any but the most free-spirited proctors).
Eliminate as many surprises as you can. Make sure you know where the test will be given, when it starts,
what type of questions are going to be asked, and how long the test will take. You don’t want to be worrying
about any of these things on test day or, even worse, after the test has already begun.
The best way to avoid stress is to study both the test material and the test itself. Congratulations! By reading this
book, you are taking a major step toward a stressfree AP Biology Exam.
