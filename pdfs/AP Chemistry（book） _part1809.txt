 much heat is required to convert 42.0 g of 
ethanol at 35 °C to the vapor phase at 78 °C? (b) How much 
heat is required to convert the same amount of ethanol at 
-155 °C to the vapor phase at 78 °C?
 11.46  The ﬂuorocarbon compound C2Cl3F3 has a normal boil-
ing point of 47.6 °C. The speciﬁc heats of C2Cl3F31l2 and 
C2Cl3F31g2 are 0.91 and 0.67 J>g@K, respectively. The heat of 
vaporization for the compound is 27.49 kJ>mol. Calculate 
the heat required to convert 35.0 g of C2Cl3F3 from a liquid 
at 10.00 °C to a gas at 105.00 °C.
 11.47  Indicate whether each statement is true or false: (a) The crit-
ical pressure of a substance is the pressure at which it turns 
into a solid at room temperature. (b) The critical tempera-
ture of a substance is the highest temperature at which the 
liquid phase can form. (c) Generally speaking, the higher 
the critical temperature of a substance, the lower its criti-
cal pressure. (d) In general, the more intermolecular forces 
there are in a substan
