hould verify the results of their experiment by conducting several trials and 
changing the position of the substances at the ends of the chamber.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
■ Designing and Conducting Your Investigation 
Now that you have discovered the preferences for individual substances, design an 
experiment using the choice chamber to compare the preferences of fruit flies to all test 
substances or the chemotactic responses of your flies. Create a table that includes the 
results comparing all of the substances you tested. 
The following are questions that you could investigate; however, as you worked 
through the beginning of this lab, you should have developed your own question and an 
investigation to answer that question: 
• Are all substances equally attractive or repellant to the fruit flies? 
• Which substances do fruit flies prefer the most? 
• Which substances do fruit flies prefer the least? 
• Do preferred substances have any characteristic in com
