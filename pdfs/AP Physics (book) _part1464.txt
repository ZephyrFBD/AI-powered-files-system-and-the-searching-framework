FIGURE 13–28 Diffusion occurs
from a region of high concentration
to one of lower concentration (only
one type of molecule is shown).
Diffusion of ammonia in air. To get an idea
of the time required for diffusion, estimate how long it might take for ammonia
to be detected 10 cm from a bottle after it is opened, assuming only 
diffusion is occurring.
APPROACH This will be an order-of-magnitude calculation. The rate of diffu-
sion J can be set equal to the number of molecules N diffusing across area A in
a time :
Then the time 
where J is given by Eq. 13–10.
We will have to make some assumptions and rough approximations about 
concentrations to use Eq. 13–10.
SOLUTION Using Eq. 13–10, we find
The average conc
