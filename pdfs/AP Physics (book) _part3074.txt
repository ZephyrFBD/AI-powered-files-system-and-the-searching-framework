wave does not close (and hence
interferes destructively with itself),
it rapidly dies out.

Now we have a first explanation for the quantized orbits and energy states in the
Bohr model: they are due to the wave nature of the electron, and only resonant
“standing” waves can persist.† This implies that the wave–particle duality is at 
the root of atomic structure.
In viewing the circular electron waves of Fig. 27–31, the electron is not to be
thought of as following the oscillating wave pattern. In the Bohr model of hydrogen,
the electron moves in a
