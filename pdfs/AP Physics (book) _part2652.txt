 greater for
the shorter wavelengths, violet light is bent the most and red the least, as shown in
Fig. 24–15. This spreading of white light into the full spectrum is called dispersion.
Rainbows are a spectacular example of dispersion—by drops of water. You can
see rainbows when you look at falling water droplets with the Sun behind you.
Figure 24–16 shows how red and violet rays are bent by spherical water droplets
and are reflected off the back surface of the droplet. Red is bent the least and so
reaches the observer’s eyes from droplets higher in the sky, as shown in Fig. 24–16a.
Thus the top of the rainbow is red.

Diamonds achieve their brilliance (Fig. 24–17) from a combination of disper-
sion and total internal reflection. Because diamonds have a very high index of
refraction of about 2.4, the critical angle for total internal reflection is only 25°.
