 vs. Time (Minutes)
The conditions of the experiment can be varied to investigate the effects of different independent variables on the
time required for the leaf disks to float. The time required for 50% of the leaf disks to float (ET50) under each
condition can be compared to learn how different conditions affect the rate of photosynthesis.
Lab 6: Cellular Respiration
The energy stored in the chemical bonds of glucose during the process of photosynthesis is released by the process
of cellular respiration. The overall equation for cellular respiration is the following:
The rate of cellular respiration can be measured by the rate of consumption of the reactants (glucose and oxygen)
or the rate of production of the products (carbon dioxide and water).
A respirometer is a sealed chamber with an attached measuring pipette that is used to measure the change in
volume due to the respiration of the organism. A small respiring organism (germinating seeds, fruit flies, and
crickets are commonl
