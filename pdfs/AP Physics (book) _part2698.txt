s can be made with an interferometer. The
motion of mirror 
by only 
produces a clear difference between brightness
and darkness. For 
this means a precision of 100 nm, or 
If
mirror 
is tilted very slightly, the bright or dark spots are seen instead as a
series of bright and dark lines or “fringes” that move as 
moves. By counting
the number of fringes (or fractions thereof) that pass a reference line, extremely
precise length measurements can be made.
