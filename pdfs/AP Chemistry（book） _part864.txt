at would be the final temperature of the system if all 
the heat lost by the copper block were absorbed by the water 
in the calorimeter?
 5.107 (a) When a 0.235-g sample of benzoic acid is combusted 
in a bomb calorimeter (Figure 5.19), the temperature rises 
1.642 °C. When a 0.265-g sample of caffeine, C8H10N4O2, 
Describe the difference in the state of the system at the end 
of the process in the two cases. What can you say about the 
relative values of ∆E?

 (a) For each of these substances, calculate the molar en-
thalpy of combustion to CO21g2 and H2O1l2. (b) Calculate 
the fuel value, in kJ>g, for each of these compounds. (c) For 
each hydrocarbon, determine the percentage of hydrogen 
by mass. (d) By comparing you
