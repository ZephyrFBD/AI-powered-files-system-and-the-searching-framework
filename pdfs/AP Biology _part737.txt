es are released into the blood or tissue and are disposed of
by circulating antibodies. Because Tc cells have CD8 accessory proteins
on their surface, they are also referred to as CD8 cells. See Figure 17.1.
B Lymphocytesâ€”B Cells
B cells mature in bone marrow, from which they get their name. A typical
B lymphocyte or B cell has about 100,000 identical antigen receptors on
its surface that it uses to recognize pathogens. Each person produces more
than a million different B cells, each with a different antigen receptor.
Each antigen receptor is a Y-shaped molecule consisting of 4 polypeptide
chains: two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. Each
chain has constant and variable regions. Antibodies secreted by B cells are
soluble forms of these antigen receptors. Figure 17.2 shows a typical B
lymphocyte.
B cells provide adaptive immunity through the humoral immune
response, meaning they produce antibodies (immunoglobulins). When
they become activated, B cells secrete about
