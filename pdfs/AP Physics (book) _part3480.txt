influx of energy heats and ionizes the pellet into a plasma, compressing 
it and heating it to temperatures at which fusion can occur 
The 
confinement time is on the order of 
to 
during which time the ions do
not move appreciably because of their own inertia, and fusion can take place.

1–4 Passage of Radiation Through
Matter; Biological Damage
When we speak of radiation, we include 
and X-rays, as well as protons,
neutrons, and other particles such as pions (see Chapter 32). Because charged
particles can ionize the atoms or molecules of any material they pass through, they
are referred to as ionizing radiation. And because radiation produces ionization,
it can cause considerable damage to materials, particularly to biological tissue.
