ons, their sizes, and their arrangement in the solid. We saw in Section 5.1 that the 
 
electrostatic potential energy of two interacting charged particles is given by
 
Eel = kQ 1Q 2
d
 
[8.4]
In this equation Q 1 and Q 2 are the charges on the particles in Coulombs, with 
their signs; d is the distance between their centers in meters; and k is a constant, 
8.99 * 109 J@m>C2. Equation 8.4 indicates that the attractive interaction between 
two oppositely charged ions increases as the magnitudes of their charges increase 
and as the distance between their centers decreases. Thus, for a given arrangement 
of ions, the lattice energy increases as the charges on the ions increase and as their radii 
decrease. The variation in the magnitude of lattice energies depends more on ionic 
charge than on ionic radius because ionic radii vary over only a limited range compared 
to charges.
Give It Some Thought
If you were to perform the reaction KCl1s2 ยก K+1g2+ Cl-1g2, would energy be 
released?
