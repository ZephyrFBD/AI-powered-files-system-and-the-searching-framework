STUDY TIP
The neuron allows for the detection, generation, transmission, and integration of signal
information.
 
Resting Potential
All living cells exhibit a membrane potential, a difference in electrical
charge between the cytoplasm (negatively charged) and extracellular fluid
(positively charged). Physiologists measure this difference in membrane
potential using microelectrodes connected to a voltmeter. This potential
should be between –50 mV and –100 mV. The negative sign indicates that
the inside of the cell is negative relative to the outside of the cell. A neuron
in its unstimulated or polarized state (resting potential) has a membrane
potential of about –70 mV. The sodium-potassium pump maintains the
membrane potential (the polarization) by actively pumping ions that leak
across the membrane. Potassium ions leak passively down the gradient
across the
