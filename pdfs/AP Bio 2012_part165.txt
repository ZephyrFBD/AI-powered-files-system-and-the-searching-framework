trogen, an essential plant 
nutrient, would not decrease the algal growth.

(D)
This option is incorrect because adding nitrogen, an essential plant nutrient, 
would not increase then decrease the algal growth.

Question 62
Essential Knowledge
2.A.2: Organisms capture and store free energy for use in 
biological processes. 
Science Practice
3.1: The student can pose scientific questions.
Learning Objective 
2.4: The student is able to use representations to pose 
scientific questions about what mechanisms and 
structural features allow organisms to capture, store, and 
use free energy.
(A)
This option is correct because both diagrams indicate that hydrogen ions are 
flowing back down their gradient through a channel in the transmembrane 
protein (ATP synthase) to phosphorylate ADP
, forming ATP
.
(B)
This option is incorrect because neither diagram shows the changes of energy to 
drive the e
