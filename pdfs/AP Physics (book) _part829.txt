The sum 
represents the sum of the masses of each particle in the
object multiplied by the square of the distance of that particle from the axis 
of rotation. If we assign each particle a number 
then 
This sum is called the moment of inertia (or rotational
inertia) I of the object:
(8;13)
Combining Eqs. 8–12 and 8–13, we can write
(8;14)
This is the rotational equivalent of Newton’s second law. It is valid for the rota-
tion of a rigid object about a fixed axis. [It is also valid when the object is rotating
while translating with acceleration, as long as I and 
are calculated about the
center of mass of the object, and the rotation axis through the CM doesn’t change
direction. A ball rolling down a ramp is an example.]
We see that the moment of inertia, I, which is a measure of the rotational
inertia of an object, plays the same role for rotational motion that mass does for
translational motion. As can be seen from Eq. 8–13, the rotational inertia of a
rigid object depends not only on
