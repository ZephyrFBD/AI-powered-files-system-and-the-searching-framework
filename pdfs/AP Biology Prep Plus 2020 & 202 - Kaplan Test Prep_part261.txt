rest of the
plant, so one could place the stem of a rose in the soil and it would grow
adventitious roots and become a whole plant. By default, this produces a
series of plants that are all genetically identical and reduces variation in
the population, but it is advantageous when sexual reproduction is not
suitable for a given environmental situation.
AP EXPERT NOTE
All plants exhibit a definite alternation of generations in which
the plant life cycle alternates between haploid and diploid stages.
Most terrestrial plants live their lives as diploid sporophytes and produce
haploid tissue in the form of ovules and pollen (gametophytes),
sometimes within the same flower. Pollen is delivered to the female
gametophyte either by an animal, such as a bird, or by the wind, and
fertilization takes place. The flower functions as the entire reproductive
organ, completely dependent on the sporophyte plant. This is a
departure from aquatic plants, in which spores travel independently
from the plant
