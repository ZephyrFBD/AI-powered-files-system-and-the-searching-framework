 The waves spread out in all directions after passing through
the slits (Fig. 24–6), but they are shown in Figs. 24–7a, b, and c only for three dif-
ferent angles 
In Fig. 24–7a, the waves reaching the center of the screen are shown
Waves from the two slits travel the same distance, so they are in phase:
a crest of one wave arrives at the same time as a crest of the other wave.
Hence the amplitudes of the two waves add to form a larger amplitude as shown
in Fig. 24–8a. This is constructive interference, and there is a bright line at the
center of the screen. Constructive interference also occurs when the paths of the
two rays differ by one wavelength (or any whole number of wavelengths), as shown
in Fig.24–7b; also here there will be a bright line on the screen. But if one ray travels
an extra distance of one-half wavelength (or 
and so on), the two waves
are exactly out of phase (Section 11–11) when they reach the screen: the crests of
one wave arrive at the same time as the troughs o
