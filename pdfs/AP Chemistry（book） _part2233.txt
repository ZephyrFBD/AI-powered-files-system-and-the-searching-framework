CHAPTER 14 Chemical Kinetics
between H2 and I2 resulted in the formation of HI, the reaction would be over in much 
less than a second. Instead, at room temperature the reaction proceeds very slowly 
because only about one in every 1013 collisions produces a reaction. What keeps the reac-
tion from occurring more rapidly?
The Orientation Factor
In most reactions, collisions between molecules result in a chemical reaction only if the 
molecules are oriented in a certain way when they collide. The relative orientations of 
the molecules during collision determine whether the atoms are suitably positioned to 
form new bonds. For example, consider the reaction
 
Cl + NOCl ¡ NO + Cl2 
which takes place if the collision brings Cl atoms together to form C
