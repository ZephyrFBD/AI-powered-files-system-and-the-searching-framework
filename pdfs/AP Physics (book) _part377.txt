slational motion, all the forces on a
given object can be drawn as acting at the center of the object, thus treating the
object as a point particle. However, for problems involving rotation or statics, the
place where each force acts is also important, as we shall see in Chapters 8 and 9.
In the Examples in this Section, we assume that all surfaces are very smooth so
that friction can be ignored. (Friction, and Examples using it, are discussed in
Section 4–8.)
Pulling the mystery box. Suppose a friend asks to examine
the 10.0-kg box you were given (Example 4–6, Fig. 4–15), hoping to guess what
is inside; and you respond, “Sure, pull the box over to you.” She then pulls 
the box by the attached cord, as shown in Fig. 4–21a, along the smooth surface 
of the table. The magnitude of the force exerted by the person is  
and it is exerted at a 30.0° angle as shown. Calculate (a) the acceleration of the
box, and (b) the magnitude of the upward force 
exerted by the table on the 
box. Assume t
