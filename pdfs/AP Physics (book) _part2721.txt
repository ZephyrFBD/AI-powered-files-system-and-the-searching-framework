pass through a maximum length of atmosphere. Much of the blue has been taken
out by scattering. The light that reaches us at this low angle where the Sun is near
the horizon, and reflects off clouds and haze, is thus lacking in blue. That is why
sunsets appear reddish.
The dependence of scattering on 
is valid only if the scattering objects
are much smaller than the wavelength of the light. This is valid for oxygen and
nitrogen molecules whose diameters are about 0.2 nm. Clouds, however, contain
water droplets or crystals that are much larger than 
They scatter all frequencies
of light nearly uniformly. Hence clouds appear white (or gray, if shadowed).

scattered by molecules of the air. An
observer at right angles sees plane-
polarized light, since the component
of oscillation along the line of sight
emits no light along that line.
