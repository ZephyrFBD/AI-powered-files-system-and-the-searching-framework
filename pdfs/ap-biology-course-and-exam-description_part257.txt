Communication, Group 
Collaboration, and the 
Laboratory Record
Lab work is an excellent means through which students 
can develop and practice communication skills. 
Success in subsequent work in the field of biology 
depends heavily on an ability to communicate about 
observations, ideas, and conclusions. Working in a truly 
collaborative manner to plan and execute experiments 
will help students learn oral communication skills and 
practice teamwork. Students must be encouraged to 
take individual responsibility for the success or failure of 
the collaboration.
After students are given a question for investigation, 
they may report their findings to their teacher and/
or their peers for feedback. Students should be 
encouraged to critique and challenge one another’s 
claims based on the evidence collected during 
the investigation. 
Lab Safety
A successful AP Biology lab program will instill in each 
student a lifelong “safety sense” that will ensure their 
safe
