C. Based on these data, predict, with justification, changes
over time in the aminopeptidase enzyme for these
populations.
D. The B form of this aminopeptidase is slightly more
efficient at extracting nutritional leucine from a protein
than the A and C forms but slightly less efficient at
extracting valine and serine. Describe an investigation of
the two habitats that could suggest a causal relationship
between changes in allele frequency and characteristics of
the environment.
E. Single-nucleotide mutations are neutral when they
encode changes in proteins that result in no significant
differential selection. If differences in environmental
factors between sites 1 and 2 are not observed, predict
what other factors could result in departures from Hardy-
