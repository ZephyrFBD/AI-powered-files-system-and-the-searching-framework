9. Differences in human blood types show how genetic
differences have evolved over time, affecting red blood
cell structure. What is the basis for blood type
classifications?
a.
It is based on antigens made of carbohydrates,
specifically glycoside and N-acetylglucosamine,
found on the surface of red blood cells.
b.
It is based on antigens made of proteins,
specifically glycolipids and glycoproteins, found
on the surface of red blood cells.
c.
It is based on antigens made of proteins,
specifically peripheral and integral proteins,
found on the surface of the red blood cell.
d.
It is based on antigens made of lipids,
specifically glyceroph
