ion. The interference pattern in the film emulsion can be thought of as an array
of bands or ribbons where constructive interference occurred. This array, and the
reconstruction of the image, can be compared to Bragg scattering of X-rays from
the atoms in a crystal (see Section 25–11). White light can reconstruct the image
because the Bragg condition 
selects out the appropriate single
wavelength. If the hologram is originally produced by lasers emitting the three
additive primary colors (red, green, and blue), the three-dimensional image can
be seen in full color when viewed with white light.

MisConceptual Questions

1. Compare a matter wave 
to (a) a wave on a string, (b) an
EM wave. Discuss similarities and differences.
2. Explain why Bohr’s theory of the atom is not compatible
with quantum mechanics, particularly the uncertainty
principle.
3. Explain why it is that the more massive an object is, the
easier it becomes to predict its future position.
4. In view of
