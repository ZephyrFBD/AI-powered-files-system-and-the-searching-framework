ic Study Modules explain the concept using materials from 
the text. These are available as graded assignments prior to class, 
and accessible on smartphones, tablets, and computers.
NEW! The Chemistry Primer helps students remediate their 
chemistry math skills and prepare for their first college chemistry 
course.
•   
Pre-built Assignments get students up to speed at the 
beginning of the course.
•   
Math is covered in the context of chemistry, basic chemical literacy, 
balancing chemical equations, mole theory, and stoichiometry.
•   
Scaled to students’ needs, remediation is only suggested to 
students that perform poorly on initial assessment.
•   
Remediation includes tutorials, wrong-answer specific feedback, 
video instruction, and step-wise scaffolding to build students’ 
abilities.
MasteringChemistryTM delivers engaging, dynamic learning opportunities—focusing on course 
objectives and responsive to each student’s progress—that are proven to help students absorb
