rly) all the mag-
netic flux produced by the current in the primary coil also passes through 
the secondary coil, and we assume this is true in what follows. We also 
assume that energy losses (in resistance and hysteresis) can be ignored—a good
approximation for real transformers, which are often better than 99% efficient.
When an ac voltage is applied to the primary coil, the changing magnetic
field it produces will induce an ac voltage of the same frequency in the secondary
coil. However, the voltage will be different according to the number of “turns” or
loops in each coil. From Faraday’s law, the voltage or emf induced in the
secondary coil is
where 
is the number of turns in the secondary coil, and 
is the rate at
which the magnetic flux changes.
The input primary voltage,
is related to the rate at which the flux changes
through it,
where 
is the number of turns in the primary coil. This follows because the
changing flux produces a back emf,
in the primary that balances 
the appl
