5. Model a figure skater’s body as a solid cylinder and her
arms as thin rods, making reasonable estimates for the dimen-
sions. Then calculate the ratio of the angular speeds for a
spinning skater with outstretched arms, and with arms held
tightly against her body. Check Sections 8–5 and 8–8.
6. One possibility for a low-pollution automobile is for it to
use energy stored in a heavy rotating flywheel. Suppose
such a car has a total mass of 1100 kg, uses a uniform cylin-
drical flywheel of diameter 1.50 m and mass 270 kg, and
should be able to travel 350 km without needing a flywheel
“spinup.” (a) Make reasonable assumptions (average fric-
tional retarding force on car
thirty acceleration
periods from rest to 
equal uphill and downhill, and
that energy can be put back into the flywheel as the car goes
downhill), and estimate what total energy needs
