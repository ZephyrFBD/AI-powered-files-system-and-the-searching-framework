 CO2 or CO, (c) SiH4 or GeH4.
 11.22  Which member in each pair has the stronger intermolecular 
dispersion forces? (a) Br2 or O2, (b) CH3CH2CH2CH2SH or 
CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2SH, (c) CH3CH2CH2Cl or 1CH322CHCl.
 11.23  Butane and 2-methylpropane, whose space-ﬁlling mod-
els are shown here, are both nonpolar and have the same 
molecular formula, C4H10, yet butane has the higher boil-
ing point 1-0.5 °C compared to -11.7 °C2. Explain.
 11.24  Propyl alcohol 1CH3CH2CH2OH2 and isopropyl alcohol 
31CH322CHOH4, whose space-ﬁlling models are shown, 
have boiling points of 97.2 and 82.5 °C, respectively. 
Explain why the boiling point of propyl alcohol is higher, 
even though both have the molecular formula, C3H8O.
 11.25  (a) What atoms must a molecule contain to participate 
in hydrogen bonding with other molecules of the same 
kind? (b) Which of the following molecules can form 
hydrogen bonds with other molecules of the same kind: 
CH3F, CH3NH2, CH3OH, CH3Br?
