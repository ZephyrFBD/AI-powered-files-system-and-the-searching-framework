 this result?
(A) The membrane protein requires processing in the ER and Golgi, which are missing in the bacterial cells.
(B) Bacteria do not make membrane proteins.
(C) Bacteria do not use different transcription factors than humans, so the gene was not expressed.
(D) Bacteria do not have enough tRNAs to make this protein sequence.
8. BamHI is a restriction enzyme derived from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens that recognizes short palindromic
sequences in DNA. When the enzyme recognizes these sequences, it cleaves the DNA. What purpose would
restriction enzymes have in a bacterium like Bacillus?
(A) They are enzymes that no longer have a purpose because evolution has produced better enzymes.
(B) They destroy extra DNA that results from errors in binary fission.
(C) They protect Bacillus from invading DNA due to viruses.
(D) They prevent, or restrict, DNA replication when the cell isnâ€™t ready to copy its DNA.
9. Viruses and bacteria have which of the following in common?
(A) Ribosomes
(B) Nu
