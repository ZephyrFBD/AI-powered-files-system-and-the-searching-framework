ructure and function of plant cells, tissues, and organs. It also covers important plant physiological functions such as
tissue differentiation, material transport, and the roles of plant hormones.
Unit 7: Animal Structure and Function. An introduction to the form and function of the animal body is followed
by detailed chapters on specific body systems and their physiological function. This unit touches on the biology of all
organisms while maintaining an engaging focus on human anatomy and physiology that helps students connect to the
topics.
Unit 8: Ecology. Ecological concepts are broadly covered in this unit, beginning with the small-scale relationships
of population ecology and gradually building to the large-scale processes of ecosystem ecology. Localized, real-world
issues of conservation and biodiversity are presented at numerous points along the way.
