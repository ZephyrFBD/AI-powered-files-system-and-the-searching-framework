e an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to make a DNA complement of
their RNA. The DNA complement can then be transcribed immediately to manufacture mRNA (lytic cycle), or it
can begin the lysogenic cycle by becoming incorporated into the DNA of the host. Because there is often little
specificity to where the viral DNA is inserted into the host genome, retroviruses are a special kind of transposon.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the cause of AIDS) is a retrovirus.
Because viruses produce many copies over very short intervals, their potential for rapid evolution is great. RNA
viruses, in particular, have much higher rates of replication errors because RNA replication lacks the repair
mechanisms associated with DNA replication. As a result, mutations in RNA viruses are more frequent than in DNA
viruses.
Evolution of viruses is also augmented when the genetic material of several different, but related viruses, recombine
when present together in a host cell. There is evidence that two
