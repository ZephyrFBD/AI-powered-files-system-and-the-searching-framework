the enzyme that
hydrolyzes lactose.
Enzymes catalyze reactions in both directions:
lactose ↔Lactase glucose + galactose

Enzymes often require assistance from cofactors (inorganic) or
coenzymes (vitamins).
Enzymes will not catalyze a reaction that would not occur
otherwise.
The efficiency of the enzyme is affected by temperature and pH.
Average human body temperature is 37°C, near optimal for human
enzymes. When body temperature is too high, enzymes will begin
to denature and lose both their unique conformation and their
ability to function. Gastric enzymes become active at low pH, when
mixed with stomach acid, while intestinal amylase works best in an
alkaline environment; see Figures 5.5 and 5.6.
