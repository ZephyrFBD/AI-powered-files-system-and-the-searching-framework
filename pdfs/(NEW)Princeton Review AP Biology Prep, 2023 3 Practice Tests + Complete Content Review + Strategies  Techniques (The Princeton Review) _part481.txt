ct Rule
The product rule is used for independent events and is also called the “AND rule.” The probability of independent
events occurring together is the product of their separate probabilities. This rule is used when the order of the events
matters.
Example: What is the probability of drawing a heart and a spade consecutively from a deck of cards if the first draw
was replaced before the second draw?
Solution:
P(heart) = 
 = 
P(spade) = 
 = 
P(heart and spade) = P(heart) × P(spade)
P(heart and spade) =  ×  = 
Sum Rule
The sum rule is used for studying two mutually exclusive events, and can be thought of as the “EITHER” rule. The
probability of either of two events occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities.
Example: What is the probability of drawing a diamond or a heart from a deck of cards?
Solution:
P(diamond) = 
 = 
P(heart) = 
 = 
P(diamond or heart) = P(diamond) + P(heart)
P(diamond or heart) =  +  =  = 
If the events you are studying are not mutually exclusive, suc
