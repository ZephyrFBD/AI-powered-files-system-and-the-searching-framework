3.42 The student is able to describe how organisms exchange information in response to
internal changes or environmental cues.
Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes. The idea that behaviors evolved
as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new. Animal behavior has been studied for decades, by biologists in the
science of ethology, by psychologists in the science of comparative psychology, and by scientists of many disciplines in the
study of neurobiology. Although there is overlap between these disciplines, scientists in these behavioral fields take different
approaches. Comparative psychology is an extension of work done in human and behavioral psychology. Ethology is an
extension of genetics, evolution, anatomy, physiology, and other biological disciplines. Still, one cannot study behavioral
biology without touching on both comparative psychology and ethology.
