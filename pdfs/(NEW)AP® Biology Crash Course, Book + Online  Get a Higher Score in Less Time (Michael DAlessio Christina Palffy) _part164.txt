Major Effects of Human Intervention on a Global Level
Problem
Cause
Global Consequence
Solution Attempted
Depletion of ozone
layer surrounding
the Earth
Use of CFCs
–More UV radiation
–Greater cancer risk in
humans
–Greater likelihood of
DNA damage in
organisms
Phase out use of CFCs
Acid precipitation
(pH below 5.6)
Sulfur and nitrogen oxides
released from burning fossil fuels,
especially coal
–Increase in aluminum
toxicity in plants
–Death of vulnerable
organisms
–Damage to entire
ecosystems
Reduce sulfur and nitrogen
oxides through “cap and
trade” programs
Toxins, such as
DDT, PCBs, and
mercury
Industrial and household waste
–Poisoning and death of
species in multiple
ecosystems
–Toxicity to humans
–Ban the use of the toxin
–Clear industrial waste of
toxin before release
Global climate
change
Increased greenhouse gases,
mainly from the burning of fossil
fuels
–Polar ice melts, sea
level
