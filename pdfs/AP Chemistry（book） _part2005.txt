An ideal quantum dot for use in TVs does not contain any 
cadmium due to concerns about disposal. One poten-
tial material for this purpose is InP
, which adopts the zinc 
blende (ZnS) structure (face-centered cubic). The unit cell 
edge length is 5.869 Ã…. (a) If the quantum dot is shaped like 
a cube, how many of each type of atom are there in a cu-
bic crystal with an edge length of 3.00 nm? 5.00 nm? (b) If 
one of the nanoparticles in part (a) emits blue light and the 
other emits orange light, which color is emitted by the crys-
tal with the 3.00-nm edge length? With the 5.00-nm edge 
length?

Which statement correctly describes a difference between 
graphene and graphite?
 
 (a) Graphene is a molecule but graphite is not. (b) Graphene 
is a single sheet of carbon atoms and graphite contains 
many, and larger, sheets of carbon atoms. (c) Graphene is an 
insulator but graphite is a metal. (d) Graphite is pure carbon 
but graphene is not.
