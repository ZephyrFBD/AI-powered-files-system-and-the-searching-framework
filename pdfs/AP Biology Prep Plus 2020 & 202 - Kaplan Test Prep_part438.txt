hyll
is oxidized (loses an electron), and the electron is transferred to the
electron transport chain. (C) correctly illustrates this process. (A) and
(B) are incorrect because the light reactions occur in the thylakoid
membrane, not the chloroplast membrane. (D) is incorrect because
the direction of the energy transfer arrows is reversed and because the
molecule should be a primary electron acceptor, not a donor.

Since the rate of photosynthesis as a function of carbon dioxide
concentration behaves similarly to the rate of photosynthesis as a
function of light intensity, the graph can be used to represent the
relationship between carbon dioxide concentration and the rate of
photosynthesis. According to the graph, at low light intensity, the rate
of photosynthesis increases as light intensity increases, whereas at
high light intensity, the rate of photosynthesis plateaus (an increase in
light intensity does not increase the rate of photosynthesis). Thus, l
