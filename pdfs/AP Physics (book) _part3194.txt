nd subshells (according
to ).
Electron configurations are specified using the numerical
values of n, and using letters for 
s, p, d, f, etc., for
and so on, plus a superscript for the number of
electrons in that subshell. Thus, the ground state of hydrogen 
is 
whereas that for oxygen is 
In the Periodic Table, the elements are arranged in horizontal
rows according to increasing atomic number (
number of elec-
trons in the neutral atom). The shell structure gives rise to a
periodicity in the properties of the elements, so that each vertical
column can contain elements with similar chemical properties.
X-rays, which are a form of electromagnetic radiation of
very short wavelength, are produced when high-speed electrons
strike a target. The spectrum of X-rays so produced consists of
two parts, a continuous spectrum produced when the electrons
are decelerated by atoms of the target, and peaks representing
photons emitted by atoms of the target after being excited by
collision with the hig
