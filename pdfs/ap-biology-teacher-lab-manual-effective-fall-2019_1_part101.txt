ematical Modeling: Hardy-Weinberg. Powerful 
statistical packages, spreadsheets, and many Web tools are readily available to compute 
these statistics. 
Thus, your focus should not be on teaching computation, but should instead be on 
helping students develop the skills for using statistics to inform their investigations. For 
example, students should select appropriate tests before data are collected in order to 
inform experimental design. They should consider, for example, whether the sample size 
is sufficiently large to test the hypotheses, how to minimize type I (false positive) and 
type II (false negative) errors, and whether outliers should be included. Statistics builds 
on all of the counting, measuring, graphing, data mining, analysis, and problem solving 
previously described; statistics also facilitates the development of keen judgment to deal 
with the ambiguous and unwarranted assumptions that are typical of an investigation. As 
with problem solving, it is essential th
