Think About It
If mRNA is complementary to the DNA template strand, and the DNA template strand is complementary to the DNA
non-template strand, are the base sequences of mRNA and the DNA non-template strand ever identical? Justify your
answer.

15.3 | Eukaryotic Transcription
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are the steps in eukaryotic transcription?
•
What are the structural and functional similarities and differences among the three RNA polymerases?
Connection for AP® Courses
As expected, transcription in eukaryotes is more complex than transcription in prokaryotes. First, transcription in eukaryotes
involves one of three types of RNA polymerase, depending on the gene being transcribed. Second, the initiation of
transcription involves the binding of several transcription factors to complex promoters which are usually located upstream
of the gene being copied. Transcription factors can either activate or inhibit g
