 in unregulated cell division and cancer. Cancer
means “crab,” as in the zodiac sign. The name comes from the observation that malignant tumors grow into
surrounding tissue, embedding themselves like clawed crabs. Cancer occurs when normal cells start behaving and
growing very abnormally and spread to other parts of the body.
Mutated genes that induce cancer are called oncogenes (“onco-” is a prefix denoting cancer). Normally, these genes
are required for proper growth of the cell and regulation of the cell cycle. Oncogenes, then, are genes that can
convert normal cells into cancerous cells. Often these are abnormal or mutated versions of normal genes. The
normal healthy version is called a proto-oncogene.
Tumor suppressor genes produce proteins that prevent the conversion of normal cells into cancer cells. They can
detect damage to the cell and work with CDK/cyclin complexes to stop cell growth until the damage can be repaired.
They can also trigger apoptosis if the damage is too seve
