Figure 11.5 Patterns of Evolution
Parallel Evolution
Parallel evolution describes two related species that have made similar
evolutionary adaptations after their divergence from a common ancestor.
The classic example of this includes the marsupial mammals of Australia
and the placental mammals of North America. (The only mammals in
Australia are the ones that have been introduced from abroad, like rabbits.)
There are striking similarities between some placental mammals like the

gray wolf of North America and the marsupial Tasmanian wolf of
Australia because they share a common ancestor and evolved in similar
environments.
Coevolution
Coevolution is the reciprocal evolutionary set of adaptations of two
interacting species. All predator-prey relationships are examples and the
relationship between the monarch butterfly and mil
