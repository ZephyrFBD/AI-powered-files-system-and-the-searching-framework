Figure 1. The chemical structure of several molecules used for quorum sensing in three species of bacteria 
Which of the following research questions would best guide an investigation of the link between the structure 
of the signaling molecules and the evolution of quorum sensing? 
(A) Do these molecules require the same receptors in each bacteria species to generate a response? 
(B) Did these species evolve from a common ancestor that used a similar signaling molecule? 
(C) Do these species all perform the same action when the concentration of the signaling molecules is high 
enough? 
(D) Did these species evolve from the same common ancestor that is still living today and uses the same 
receptors?
