 AgI will 
precipitate ﬁrst, at 3I-4 = 4.2 * 10-13 M. 17.75 AgCl will precipitate 
ﬁrst. 17.77 Ag+  (Group 1) and Mg2+ (Group 4) are deﬁnitely absent. Al3+ 
(Group 3) is deﬁnitely present and Na+ (Group 5) is possibly present.  
17.79 (a) Make the solution acidic with 0.2 M HCl; saturate with H2S. 
CdS will precipitate; ZnS will not. (b) Add excess base; Fe(OH3) (s) 
precipitates, but Cr3 +  forms the soluble complex Cr(OH)-
4. (c) Add 
(NH4)2HPO4; Mg2 +  precipitates as MgNH4PO4; K+ remains soluble. 
(d) Add 6 M HCl; precipitate Ag+ as AgCl(s); Mn2 +  remains soluble. 
17.81 (a) Base is required to increase 3PO4
3 -4 so that the solubility 
product of the metal phosphates of interest is exceeded and the phos-
phate salts precipitate. (b) Ksp for the cations in group 3 is much larger; 
to exceed Ksp, a higher 3S2 -4 is required. (c) They should all redissolve 
in strongly acidic solution. 17.83 pOH = pKb + log 53BH-4  >  3B46 
17.89 (a) 6.5 mL glacial acetic acid, 5.25 g CH3COONa
