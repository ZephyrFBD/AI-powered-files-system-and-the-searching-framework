Step 3 Create a table in your lab notebook that helps you organize the data collected, 
including estimates of the energy/biomass flow from plants to butterfly larvae. Develop 
your procedure keeping in mind your end goal — to measure the biomass consumed by 
the larvae, the biomass gained by the larvae, and the biomass lost by the larvae. Likely, 
you’ll need to estimate some factors using data from a large sample. Don’t forget about 
the energy in the frass (wastes).
Step 4 Transfer the larvae to another Brassica Barn to finish out their life cycle.
 Analyzing and Evaluating Results
■
Convert biomass measurements (grams) to energy units in kilocalories. Work in small 
groups to determine how best to complete the following tasks. Make sure t
