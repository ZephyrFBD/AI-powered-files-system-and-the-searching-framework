o calculate the energy of 
the photon emitted and then use the relationships E = hn and 
c = nl to convert energy to wavelength. The photon with the 
highest energy will have the shortest wavelength because photon 
energy is inversely proportional to wavelength.
Solve
(a)  
The wavelength of a photon is related to its energy through 
the relationship E = hn = hc>l. Hence, the photon with the 
smallest wavelength will have the largest energy. The energy 
levels of the electron orbits decrease as n decreases.
The electron loses the most energy on transitioning from the 
ni = 4 state to the nf = 1 state, and the photon emitted in that 
transition has the highest energy and the smallest wavelength.
(b)  
We first calculate the energy of the photon using Equation 6.6 
with ni = 4 and nf = 1:
∆E = -2.18 * 10-18 Ja 1
1
2 - 1
42b = -2.04 * 10-18 J 
Ephoton = - ∆E = 2.04 * 10-18 J
Next we rearrange Planck’s relationship to calculate the fre-
quency of the emitted photon.
n = E>h = 12.04 * 10−18
