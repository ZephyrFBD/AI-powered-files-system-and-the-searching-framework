w the plot goes above the 
line for 1:1 neutron-to-proton for heavier elements. The dark blue dots in the figure rep-
resent stable (nonradioactive) isotopes. The region of the graph covered by these dark 
blue dots is known as the belt of stability. The belt of stability ends at element 83 (bis-
muth), which means that all nuclei with 84 or more protons are radioactive. For example, all 
isotopes of uranium, Z = 92, are radioactive.
Different radionuclides decay in different ways. The type of decay that occurs 
depends largely on a nuclide’s neutron-to-proton ratio and how it compares with the
