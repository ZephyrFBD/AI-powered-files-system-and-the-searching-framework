w of the
conservation of energy that states that energy cannot be created or
destroyed, but can only change form. The classic example of this is how
kinetic energy can be converted to potential energy or (within the body)
chemical energy can be converted to kinetic energy.
The Second Law of Thermodynamics
The second law states that the entropy of a closed system tends to
increase. In other words, energy spreads out over time rather than
spontaneously consolidating. Eventually, diﬀerences in temperature,
pressure, and chemical potential tend to even out in a physical system
that is isolated from the outside world. Consider, for example, how
“normal” each of the following seems: hot coﬀee cools down, iron rusts,
and balloons deflate. The thermal energy in the hot coﬀee is spreading
out to the cooler air that surrounds it. The chemical energy in the bonds
of elemental iron and oxygen is released and dispersed as a result of the
formation of the more stable, lower-energy bonds of iron oxid
