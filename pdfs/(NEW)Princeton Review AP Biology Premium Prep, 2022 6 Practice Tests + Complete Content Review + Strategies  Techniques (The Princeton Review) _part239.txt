colysis
The first stage begins with glycolysis, the splitting (-lysis) of glucose (glyco-). Glucose is a six-carbon molecule that
is broken into two three-carbon molecules called pyruvic acid. This breakdown of glucose also results in the net
production of two molecules of ATP.
Pyruvic acid is an acid. In your cells, it usually loses a proton, so it is called
pyruvate instead.
Glucose + 2 ATP + 2NAD+ → 2 Pyruvic acid + 4 ATP + 2NADH
Although we’ve written glycolysis as if it were a single reaction, this process doesn’t occur in one step. In fact, it
requires a sequence of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Let’s look at a summary of these reactions:
Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and starts with one glucose and ends with
two pyruvates. There is a net production of 2 ATP and 2 NADH.
If you take a good look at the reactions above, you’ll see two ATPs are needed to produce four ATP. You’ve
probably heard the expression “You have to spend money to make money.” In biology, you have to invest A
