Planet Report from the World Wildlife Federation claims
global populations of animals fell by 58 percent between
1970 and 2012 and extrapolates the loss by 2020 to 67%.
E.O. Wilson's estimate of the current extinction rate is
three species per hour. Geologic periods are defined by
mass extinctions. The proposed name for the current
geological period is the Anthropocene (Waters et al.,
Science, 2016).
During the current period of mass extinction, human
activities are driving loss of habitat and climate change.
Climate change during the last 500,000 years is a direct
consequence of rising atmospheric CO2 levels, as the
graph shows. The relative abundance of O16 and O18
isotopes can be used to infer temperature because as
temperature increases the lower mass isotope is enriched
in the atmosphere (objects with a smaller mass have a
higher velocity at equal molecular kinetic energy that is
proportional to temperature).
