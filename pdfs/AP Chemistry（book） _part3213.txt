In this equation, n is a positive number without units that represents the number of moles 
of electrons transferred according to the balanced equation for the reaction, and F is the 
Faraday constant, named after Michael Faraday ( Figure 20.12):
 
F = 96,485 C>mol = 96,485 J>V@mol 
The Faraday constant is the quantity of electrical charge on 1 mol of electrons.
The units of ∆G calculated with Equation 20.11 are J>mol. As in Equation 19.19, we 
use “per mole” to mean per mole of reaction as indicated by the coefficients in the bal-
anced equation. 
 (Section 19.7)
Because both n and F are positive numbers, a positive value of E in Equation 20.11 
leads to a negative value of ∆G. Remember: A positive value of E and a negative value of ∆G 
both indicate a spontaneous reaction. When the reactants and products are all in their stan-
dard states, Equation 20.11 can be modified to relate ∆G° and E°.
 
∆G° = -nFE°

Because ∆G° is related to the equilibrium constant, K, for
