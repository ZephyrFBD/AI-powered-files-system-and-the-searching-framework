33. (III) A diver leaves the end of a 4.0-m-high diving board
and strikes the water 1.3 s later, 3.0 m beyond the end of
the board. Considering the diver as a particle, determine:
(a) her initial velocity,
(b) the maximum height reached;
and (c) the velocity 
with which she enters the water.
34. (III) Show that the time required for a projectile to reach
its highest point is equal to the time for it to return to its
original height if air resistance is neglible.
35. (III) Suppose the kick in Example 3–6 is attempted 36.0 m
from the goalposts, whose crossbar is 3.05 m above the
ground. If the football is directed perfectly between the
goalposts, will it pass over the bar and be a field goal?
Show why or why not. If not, from what horizontal distance
must this kick be made if it is to score?

at a 27.0° angle and lands 7.80 m away. (a) What was the
