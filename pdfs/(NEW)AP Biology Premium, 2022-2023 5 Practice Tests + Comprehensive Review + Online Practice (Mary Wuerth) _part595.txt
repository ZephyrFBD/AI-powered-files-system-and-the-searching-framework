 to prevent errors
in cell division. Factors that regulate cell division are discussed further in Chapter 11.
Part 4: In this part of the investigation, the process of meiosis is modeled using beads, pipe cleaners, clay, or a
variety of other tools. After modeling the process of meiosis, you should have a better understanding of:
■How haploid gametes are formed from diploid cells
■How meiosis generates genetic diversity
■The events in meiosis that demonstrate Mendel’s law of independent assortment
■The events in meiosis that demonstrate Mendel’s law of segregation
■How the distance between two genes on a chromosome affects the frequency of genetic recombination
between the two genes
Part 5: In the final part of this lab investigation, slides of Sordaria fimicola are observed. The frequency of
recombination events (between the centromere and the gene that controls spore color in Sordaria) is used to
calculate the genetic distance between the centromere and the gene for spore color. The
