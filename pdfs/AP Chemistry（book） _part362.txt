composed into its elements. (a) If 0.384 g of hydrogen is obtained 
in this experiment, how many grams of sulfur must be obtained? 
(b) What fundamental law does this experiment demonstrate?
 2.13  A chemist finds that 30.82 g of nitrogen will react with 17.60, 
35.20, 70.40, or 88.00 g of oxygen to form four different 
compounds. (a) Calculate the mass of oxygen per gram of 
 
nitrogen in each compound. (b) How do the numbers in 
 
part (a) support Dalton’s atomic theory?
 2.14  In a series of experiments, a chemist prepared three different 
compounds that contain only iodine and fluorine and deter-
mined the mass of each element in each compound:

 (a) Calculate the mass of fluorine per gram of iodine in each 
compound. (b) How do the numbers in part (a) support the 
atomic theory?
