as seen from afar. The dots represent
a hypothetical detection of an
electron at each point: dots closer
together represent more probable
presence of an electron (denser

The view presented here is the generally accepted one and is called the
Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics in honor of Niels Bohr’s home,
since it was largely developed there through discussions between Bohr and other
prominent physicists.
Because electrons are not simply particles, they cannot be thought of as
following particular paths in space and time. This suggests that a description of
matter in space and time may not be completely correct. This deep and far-reaching
conclusion has been a lively topic of discussion among philosophers. Perhaps the
most important and influential philoso
