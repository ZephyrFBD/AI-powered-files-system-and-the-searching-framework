 Enzyme Reaction Rates
AP Biology Lab 13: Enzyme
Activity Investigation
The enzyme catalysis lab is designed to allow you to explore structural
proteins and environmental conditions that aﬀect chemical activity in the
natural world. In the lab, you will measure the chemical activity of the
enzyme catalase as it breaks down hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into water
and oxygen gas. Specific experimental conditions—temperature,
substrate and enzyme concentrations, pH, and so on—will be altered to
help you understand the eﬀects of environmental conditions on a specific
chemical reaction. This experiment helps you to learn the experimental
method through manipulation of experimental treatments compared
with a control treatment.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Graphing
For labs requiring graph construction and calculations, make sure
that your graph is labeled thoroughly and accurately. Make sure
you identify appropriate axes, show units, plot points accurately,
and assign your graph a title. You should also follo
