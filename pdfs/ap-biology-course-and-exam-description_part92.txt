TOPIC 2.4
Plasma Membranes
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
ENE-2
Cells have membranes that allow them to establish and maintain internal 
environments that are different from their external environments.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-2.A
Describe the roles of each 
of the components of the 
cell membrane in maintaining 
the internal environment of 
the cell.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-2.A.1
Phospholipids have both hydrophilic and 
hydrophobic regions. The hydrophilic 
phosphate regions of the phospholipids are 
oriented toward the aqueous external or 
internal environments, while the hydrophobic 
fatty acid regions face each other within the 
interior of the membrane.
ENE-2.A.2
Embedded proteins can be hydrophilic, with 
charged and polar side groups, or hydrophobic, 
with nonpolar side groups.
ENE-2.B
Describe the Flu
