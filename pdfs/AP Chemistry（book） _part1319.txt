8.1  For each of these Lewis symbols, indicate the group in the 
periodic table in which the element X belongs: [Section 8.1]
(a) X   (b) X   (c) X
 
8.2 Illustrated are four ions — A, B, X, and Y— showing their rela-
tive ionic radii. The ions shown in red carry positive charges: a 
2+ charge for A and a 1+ charge for B. Ions shown in blue carry 
negative charges: a 1- charge for X and a 2- charge for Y. 
(a) Which combinations of these ions produce ionic com-
pounds where there is a 1:1 ratio of cations and anions? 
 
(b) Among the combinations in part (a), which leads to 
the ionic compound having the largest lattice energy?
