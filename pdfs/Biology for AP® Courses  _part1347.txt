 same F2 phenotypic ratios (3:1). Nevertheless, these laws
summarize the basics of classical genetics.
Pairs of Unit Factors, or Genes
Mendel proposed first that paired unit factors of heredity were transmitted faithfully from generation to generation by the
dissociation and reassociation of paired factors during gametogenesis and fertilization, respectively. After he crossed peas
with contrasting traits and found that the recessive trait resurfaced in the F2 generation, Mendel deduced that hereditary
factors must be inherited as discrete units. This finding contradicted the belief at that time that parental traits were blended
in the offspring.
Alleles Can Be Dominant or Recessive
Mendel’s law of dominance states that in a heterozygote, one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same
characteristic. Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype, the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively. The
recessive allele will remain “latent” but will be transmitted
