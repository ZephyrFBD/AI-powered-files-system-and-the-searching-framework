The momentum of an object is given by
(26–4)
Mass and energy are interconvertible. The equation
(26–7)
tells how much energy E is needed to create a mass 
or vice
versa. Said another way,
is the amount of energy an
object has because of its mass m. The law of conservation of
energy must include mass as a form of energy.
The kinetic energy ke of an object moving at speed v is
given by
(26–5)
where m is the mass of the object. The total energy E, if there
is no potential energy, is
(26–6)
The momentum p of an object is related to its total 
energy E (assuming no potential energy) by
