se processes operate at the molecular and 
cellular levels.
ENE-3.C.1
Positive feedback mechanisms amplify 
responses and processes in biological 
organisms. The variable initiating the response 
is moved farther away from the initial set point. 
Amplification occurs when the stimulus is further 
activated, which, in turn, initiates an additional 
response that produces system change.
