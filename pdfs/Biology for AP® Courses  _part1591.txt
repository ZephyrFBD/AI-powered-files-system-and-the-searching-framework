56. Explain how forensic scientists are able to use DNA
analysis to identify individuals.
a.
Comparison of DNA from a known source or
individual with analysis of the sequence of an
unknown sample of DNA allows scientists to
find out if both of them are similar or not.
b.
DNA from the unknown sample is sequenced
and analyzed. The result of the analysis is then
matched with any random population. The
matching individual then helps in forensics.
c.
Comparison of DNA from a known source or
individual with analysis of the sequence of bases
