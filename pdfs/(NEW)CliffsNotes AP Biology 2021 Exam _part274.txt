also
possible, but because so few genes reside on the Y chromosome Y-linkage is rarely encountered. Note the different
uses of the word “linkage”: Used alone, the word linkage refers to two or more genes that reside on the same
chromosome; sex-linkage refers to a single gene residing specifically on a sex chromosome.
You have additional considerations when working with sex-linked genes. When females (XX) inherit a sex-linked
gene, they receive two copies of the gene, one on each X chromosome. This situation is similar to that for autosomal
inheritance. In contrast, however, a male (XY) will inherit only one copy of the gene because only the X
chromosome delivers the gene. There is no similar gene delivered by the Y chromosome. As a result, the allele on
the X chromosome of a male is the allele whose trait is expressed, regardless of whether it is dominant or recessive.
Color blindness is caused by a sex-linked, recessive gene (n) in humans. Females and males who inherit the normal
alle
