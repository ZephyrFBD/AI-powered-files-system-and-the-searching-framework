vidual) basis. Thus, B (birth rate) = bN (the per capita birth
rate “b” multiplied by the number of individuals “N”) and D (death rate) =dN (the per capita death rate “d” multiplied by
the number of individuals “N”). Additionally, ecologists are interested in the population at a particular point in time, an
infinitely small time interval. For this reason, the terminology of differential calculus is used to obtain the “instantaneous”
growth rate, replacing the change in number and time with an instant-specific measurement of number and time.
dN
dT  = bN − dN = (b -  d)N
Notice that the “d” associated with the first term refers to the derivative (as the term is used in calculus) and is different
from the death rate, also called “d.” The difference between birth and death rates is further simplified by substituting the
term “r” (intrinsic rate of increase) for the relationship between birth and death rates:
dN
dT  = rN
The value “r” can be positive, meaning the population is increasing in
