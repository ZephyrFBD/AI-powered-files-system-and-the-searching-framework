ost reactions has the general form
 
Rate = k3reactant 14m3reactant 24n c  
Thus, the task of determining the rate law becomes one of determining the reaction 
orders, m and n. In most reactions, the reaction orders are 0, 1, or 2. As noted earlier in 
this section, we can use the response of the reaction rate to a change in initial concentra-
tion to determine the reaction order.
In working with rate laws, it is important to realize that the rate of a reaction depends 
on concentration but the rate constant does not. As we will see later in this chapter, the 
rate constants (and hence the reaction rate) are affected by temperature and by the pres-
ence of a catalyst.
The initial rate of a reaction A + B ยก C was measured for three different starting concentrations of A and B, and the results 
are as follows:
