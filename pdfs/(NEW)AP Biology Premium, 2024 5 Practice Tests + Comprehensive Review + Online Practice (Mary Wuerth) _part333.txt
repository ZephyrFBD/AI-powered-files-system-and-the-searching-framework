 shown in the following table.
Phenotype
Mean Life Span in Days (± 2SEM*)
White-eyed flies
42.8 (± 5.8)
Red-eyed flies
29.1 (± 4.9)
*Standard Error of the Mean
Evaluate the data to determine whether or not there is likely a statistically significant difference in the life
spans of white-eyed and red-eyed flies based on this experiment.
(d) A nondisjunction event in meiosis leads to the production of a heterozygous red-eyed male fly with two X
chromosomes and one Y chromosome. Predict the possible offspring from a mating between this male and
a white-eyed female, and justify your answer.
Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (B) Genes that are close together on the same chromosome are linked and are more likely to be inherited
together (since they are close together on the same piece of DNA) than unlinked genes. Choice (A) is incorrect
because linked genes are more, not less, likely to be inherited together. Choices (C) and (D) are incorrect
because unlinked genes may be either on sepa
