ycled through what are
referred to as biogeochemical cycles. The six most common elements associated with organic molecules—carbon, nitrogen,
hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—take a variety of chemical forms and may exist for long periods in Earth’s
atmosphere, on land, in water, or beneath our planet’s surface. Geologic processes, including weathering and erosion, play
a role in this recycling of materials from the environment to living organisms. For the purpose of AP®, you do not need to
know the details of every biogeochemical cycle, though some details of those cycles are covered in this section.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 and Big Idea 4
of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP® exam questions. A learn
