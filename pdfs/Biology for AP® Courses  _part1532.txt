rection of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the leading strand 5' to 3'. A
protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides. The sliding clamp is
a ring-shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place. Topoisomerase prevents the over-winding
of the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up; it does so by causing temporary nicks
in the DNA helix and then resealing it. As synthesis proceeds, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA. The primers are
removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA pol I, and the gaps are filled in by deoxyribonucleotides. The nicks that remain
between the newly synthesized DNA (that replaced the RNA primer) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the
enzyme DNA ligase that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkage between the 3'-OH end of one nucleotide and
the 5' phosphate end of the other fragment.
Once the chromosome has been
