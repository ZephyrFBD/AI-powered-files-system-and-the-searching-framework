54. Calculate the Q-value for the reaction
when negative pions strike stationary protons. Estimate
the minimum pion kinetic energy needed to produce this
reaction. [Hint: Assume 
and 
move off with the same
velocity.]
55. A proton and an antiproton annihilate each other at rest
and produce two pions,
and 
What is the kinetic
energy of each pion?
56. For the reaction
where one of the ini-
tial protons is at rest, use relativistic formulas to show that
the threshold energy is 
equal to three times the
magnitude of the Q-value of the reaction, where 
is the
proton mass. [Hint: Assume all final particles have the
same velocity.]
57. At about what kinetic energy (in eV) can the rest energy
of a proton be ignored when calculating its wavelength, if
the wavelength is to be within 
of its true
