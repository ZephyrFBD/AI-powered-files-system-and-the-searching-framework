nucleus or membrane-bound organelles, and eukaryotes, which have a nucleus
and membrane-bound organelles. Features of prokaryotic cells (like bacteria, for example) can include the
following:
plasma membrane
flagella and cilia
cell wall
nucleoid region
ribosomes
circular chromosome
cytoplasm
Components of the eukaryotic cells include the following:
nucleus
nucleolus
rough endoplasmic reticulum
smooth endoplasmic reticulum
Golgi body
ribosomes
mitochondria
vacuole
lysosome
peroxisomes
centrioles (animals only)
cytoplasm
plasma membrane
cytoskeleton (microtubules, microfilaments)
central vacuole (plants only)
cell wall (plants, fungi, and some protists)
The plasma membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer. The hydrophobic nature of the inside of the
membrane is responsible for its selective permeability. Transport through the membrane is dependent on size
and polarity of the molecules and concentration gradients. There are a few different types of cellular transport:
simple diffusio
