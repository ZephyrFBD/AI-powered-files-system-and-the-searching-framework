nt b:
Thus we define the change in electric potential energy,
when a
point charge q moves from some point a to another point b, as the negative of the
work done by the electric force on the charge as it moves from point a to point b.
For example, consider the electric field between two equally but oppositely charged
parallel plates; we assume their separation is small compared to their width and
height, so the field 
will be uniform over most of the region, Fig. 17–1. Now con-
sider a tiny positive point charge q placed at the point “a” very near the positive
plate as shown. This charge q is so small that it has no effect on 
If this charge q at
point a is released, the electric force will do work on the charge and accelerate it
toward the negative plate. The work W done by the electric field E to move the
charge a distance d is (using Eq. 16–5,
)
.
The change in electric potential energy equals the negative of the work done by
the electric force:
