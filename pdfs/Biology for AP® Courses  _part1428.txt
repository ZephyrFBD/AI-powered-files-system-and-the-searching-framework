, Sturtevant suggested that genes can range from being perfectly linked
(recombination frequency = 0) to being perfectly unlinked (recombination frequency = 0.5) when genes are on different
chromosomes or genes are separated very far apart on the same chromosome. Perfectly unlinked genes correspond to the
frequencies predicted by Mendel to assort independently in a dihybrid cross. A recombination frequency of 0.5 indicates
that 50 percent of offspring are recombinants and the other 50 percent are parental types. That is, every type of allele
combination is represented with equal frequency. This representation allowed Sturtevant to additively calculate distances
between several genes on the same chromosome. However, as the genetic distances approached 0.50, his predictions became
less accurate because it was not clear whether the genes were very far apart on the same chromosome or on different
chromosomes.
In 1931, Barbara McClintock and Harriet Creighton demonstrated the crossover of h
