und semiconductors maintain the same average valence electron count as 
elemental semiconductors—four per atom. For example, in gallium arsenide, GaAs, 
each Ga atom contributes three electrons and each As atom contributes five, which 
averages out to four per atom—the same number as in silicon or germanium. Hence, 
GaAs is a semiconductor. Other examples are InP
, where indium contributes three 
valence electrons and phosphorus contributes five, and CdTe, where cadmium pro-
vides two valence electrons and tellurium contributes six. In both cases, the average 
is again four valence electrons per atom. GaAs, InP
, and CdTe all crystallize with a zinc 
blende structure.
The band gap of a compound semiconductor tends to increase as the difference in 
group numbers increases. For example, Eg = 0.67 eV in Ge, but Eg = 1.43 eV in GaAs. 
If we increase the difference in group number to four, as in ZnSe (groups 2B and 6A), 
the band gap increases to 2.70 eV. This progression is a result of the
