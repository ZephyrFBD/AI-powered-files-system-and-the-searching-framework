 helix, not adding new nucleotides.
10. (C) Plasmids are small, circular pieces of DNA outside of the nucleus that can be found in prokaryotes and
eukaryotes. Okazaki fragments are the short segments of DNA created by discontinuous replication on the
lagging strand of DNA, so choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because RNA primers are used to
give DNA polymerase a place to start adding nucleotides to on the growing DNA strand. Linear chromosomes
are found in eukaryotes, not prokaryotes, and they are in the nucleus (they are not extranuclear). Thus, choice
(D) is also incorrect.
Short Free-Response
11. (a) A virus that uses reverse transcriptase would have RNA as its genetic material, so its genome would contain
the nucleotides adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil. (Thymine is not found in RNA.)
(b) Eukaryotic cells contain DNA as their genetic material and do not need to use reverse transcriptase to make
a DNA copy of their genetic material. Therefore, eukaryotic cells d
