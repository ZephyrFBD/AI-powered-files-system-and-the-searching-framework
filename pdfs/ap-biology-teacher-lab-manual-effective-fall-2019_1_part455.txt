cancer. After your students are given time to share their knowledge, ask them to think 
about ways the cancer cells might be different from normal, healthy cells. 
Inform your students that, in cancer cells, division is fundamentally different from 
that in normal cells, but do not inform the students as to why. Ask each group to form a 
hypothesis as to how the chromosomes of a normal cell might appear in comparison to a 
cancer cell. 
Give each group pictures of chromosomes from normal and HeLa cells. The students 
should count the number of chromosomes found in each type of cell and discuss their 
appearance. Did the results match their hypothesis? If not, ask your students what type 
of information they might need to know in order to understand their results. If their 
results matched their hypothesis, ask them to identify what type of information they 
could find that would validate their conclusions. 
Explain to your students that in normal cells mitosis is blocked if there is DN
