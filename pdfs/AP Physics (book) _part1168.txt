sea level to the top of a high moun-
tain and started at the same angle of 5°, it would oscillate at the top of the mountain 
(a) slightly slower; (b) slightly faster; (c) at exactly the same frequency; (d) not at all—it
would stop; (e) none of these.
The displacement s of the pendulum along the arc is given by
where
is the angle (in radians) that the cord makes with the vertical and is the length
of the cord (Fig. 11–12). If the restoring force is proportional to s or to 
the
motion will be simple harmonic. The restoring force is the net force on the bob,
which equals the component of the weight (mg) tangent to the arc:
where g is the acceleration due to gravity. The minus sign here, as in Eq. 11–1,
means the force is in the direction opposite to the angular displacement 
Since
F is proportional to the sine of 
and not to 
itself, the motion is not SHM.
However, if is small, then 
is very nearly equal to when the angle is speci-
fied in radians. This can be seen by noting in Fig. 11–1
