▶Practice Exercise 2
Write a balanced equation for (a) solid mercury(II) sulfide  
decomposing into its component elements when heated and  
(b) aluminum metal combining with oxygen in the air.
SOLUTION
(a) With the exception of mercury, all metals are solids at 
room temperature. Fluorine occurs as a diatomic molecule. 
Thus, the reactants are Li(s) and F21g2. The product will be 
composed of a metal and a nonmetal, so we expect it to be 
an ionic solid. Lithium ions have a 1+ charge, Li+, whereas 
fluoride ions have a 1- charge, F-. Thus, the chemical  
formula for the product is LiF. The balanced chemical 
equation is
2 Li1s2 + F21g2 ¡ 2 LiF1s2
(b) The chemical formula for barium carbonate is BaCO3. As  
mentioned, many metal carbonates decompose to metal  
oxides and carbon dioxide when heated. In Equation 3.7,  
for example, CaCO3 decomposes to form CaO and CO2.  
Thus
