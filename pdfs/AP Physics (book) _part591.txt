particle or simple rigid object.
SOLUTION The net work needed is equal to the increase in kinetic energy:
= 2.5 * 105 J.

from rest to 
be more than, less than, or equal to the work already calculated to
accelerate it from

Work to stop a car. A car traveling 
can brake to a stop in a distance d of 20 m (Fig. 6–10a). If the car is going 
twice as fast,
what is its stopping distance (Fig. 6–10b)? Assume the
maximum braking force is approximately independent of speed.
RESPONSE Again we model the car as if it were a particle. Because the net stop-
ping force F is approximately constant, the work needed to stop the car,
is
proportional to the distance trave
