surface is above a certain
threshold value, the photomultiplier will only function for
incident ultraviolet wavelengths and be unresponsive to
visible light. Determine this threshold value (eV).
74. If a 100-W lightbulb emits 3.0% of the input energy as
visible light (average wavelength 550 nm) uniformly in all
directions, estimate how many photons per second of
visible light will strike the pupil (4.0 mm diameter) of the
eye of an observer, (a) 1.0 m away, (b) 1.0 km away.
75. An electron and a positron collide head on, annihilate, and
create two 0.85-MeV photons traveling in opposite direc-
tions. What were the initial kinetic energies of electron
and positron?
76. By what potential difference must (a) a proton 
and (b) an electron 
be accelerated from rest to have a wavelength
