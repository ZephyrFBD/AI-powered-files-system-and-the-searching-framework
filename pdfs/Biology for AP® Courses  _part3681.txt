age to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood
to the lungs and body. The mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the
systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. For this reason, amphibians are often
described as having double circulation.
Most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and
systemic circuits, as shown in Figure 31.4c. The ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in
less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals
to exhibit a four-chambered heart. Crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from
the lungs toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for
prey or stays underwater waiting for
