process. It
begins with the acrosome reaction, when the head of the sperm, the
acrosome, releases hydrolytic enzymes that penetrate the jelly coat of the
egg. Specific molecules from the sperm bind with receptor molecules on
the vitelline membrane before the sperm come in contact with the ovumâ€™s
plasma membrane. This specific recognition ensures that the egg will be
fertilized by only sperm from the same species. Once a sperm binds to
receptors on the egg, the membrane is dramatically depolarized and no
other sperm can penetrate the egg membrane. This change in the
membrane is known as the fast block to polyspermy. This fast block lasts
only a minute, just long enough to allow the slow block to polyspermy. The

slow block converts the vitelline membrane into an impenetrable
fertilization envelope.
Although the fusion of the sperm and egg triggers this activation, an
unfertilized egg can be activated artificially by electrical stimulation or b
