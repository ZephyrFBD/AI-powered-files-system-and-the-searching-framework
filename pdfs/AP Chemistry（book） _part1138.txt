–1980) as he

manic-depressive illness. He administered the acid to manic laboratory 
animals in the form of its most soluble salt, lithium urate, and found that 
many of the manic symptoms seemed to disappear. Later studies showed 
that uric acid has no role in the therapeutic effects observed; rather, the 
Li+ ions were responsible. Because lithium overdose can cause severe side 
effects in humans, including kidney failure and death, lithium salts were 
not approved as antipsychotic drugs for humans until 1970. Today Li+ 
is usually administered orally in the form of Li2CO3, which is the active 
ingredient in prescription drugs such as Eskalith®. Lithium drugs are ef-
fective for about 70% of bipolar patients who take it.
In this age of sophisticated drug design and biotechnology, the 
simple lithium ion is still the most effective treatment of this destruc-
tive psychiatric disorder. Remarkably, despite intensive re
