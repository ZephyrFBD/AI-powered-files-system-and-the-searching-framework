ooperative. In the
diagram above, the dependence of the bound
fraction on available insulin is similar to the
curve for k = 1 with negative cooperativity.
Describe the features of this curve in the graph
above that demonstrate negative cooperativity.
C.
When viewed from above the cell-surface, the
representation shows receptors with one and two
bound insulin molecules. Explain the negative
cooperation for this receptor based on the free
energy of conformational changes in the
receptor-peptide chains.
D.
E.
Explain the advantages in terms of selection of
two-site binding with negative cooperation
relative to one-site binding.
F.
Three binding curves with negative
cooperativity and different values of k are shown
on the graph. Describe conditions in which there
is an advantage in having a low value of k with
negative cooperativity.

signaling pathways to direct physiological responses to
environmental changes. Stomata are pores, typic
