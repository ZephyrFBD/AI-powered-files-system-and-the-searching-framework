ter 
when buffered at pH (a) 7.0, (b) 9.5, (c) 11.8.
 17.62  Calculate the molar solubility of Ni1OH22 when buffered at 
pH (a) 8.0, (b) 10.0, (c) 12.0.
 17.63  Which of the following salts will be substantially more 
soluble in acidic solution than in pure water: (a) ZnCO3,  
(b) ZnS, (c) BiI3, (d) AgCN, (e) Ba31PO422?
 17.64  For each of the following slightly soluble salts, write the 
net ionic equation, if any, for reaction with a strong acid: 
 
(a) MnS, (b) PbF2, (c) AuCl3, (d) Hg2C2O4, (e) CuBr.
 17.65  From the value of Kf  listed in Table 17.1, calculate the con-
centration of Ni2 +1aq2 and Ni1NH326
2+ that are present at 
equilibrium after dissolving 1.25 g NiCl2 in 100.0 mL of 
0.20 M NH31aq2.
 17.66  From the value of Kf  listed in Table 17.1, calculate the con-
centration of NH3 required to just dissolve 0.020 mol of 
NiC2O4 1Ksp = 4 * 10-102 in 1.00 L of solution? (Hint: You 
can neglect the hydrolysis of C2O4 
2 -  because the solution 
will be quite basic.)
