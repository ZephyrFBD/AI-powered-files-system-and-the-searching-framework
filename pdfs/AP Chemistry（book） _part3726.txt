gands should increase. 
When there is more than one electron in the d orbitals, interactions between the 
electrons make the absorption spectra more complicated than the spectrum shown 
for 3Ti(H2O)643+ in Figure 23.26, which complicates the task of relating changes in 
∆ with color. With d8 ions like Ni2+ three peaks are observed in the absorption spec-
tra. Fortunately, for Ni2+ complexes we can simplify the analysis because only one 
of these three peaks falls in the visible region of the spectrum.* Because the energy 
separation ∆ is increasing, the wavelength of the absorption peak should shift to a 
shorter wavelength. 
 (Section 6.3) In the case of 3Ni(H2O)642+ the absorption peak 
in the visible part of the spectrum reaches a maximum near 720 nm, in the red region 
of the spectrum. So the complex ion takes the complementary color—green. For 
3Ni(NH3)642+ the absorption peak reaches its maximum at 570 nm near the boundary 
between orange and yellow. The resulting color of the co
