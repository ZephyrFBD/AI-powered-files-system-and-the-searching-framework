ace enclosed by a chloroplastâ€™s inner
membrane is a set of interconnected and stacked fluid-filled membrane sacs called thylakoids (Figure 4.17). Each stack of
thylakoids is called a granum (plural = grana). The fluid enclosed by the inner membrane that surrounds the grana is called
the stroma.

Figure 4.17 The chloroplast has an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and membrane structures called thylakoids
that are stacked into grana. The space inside the thylakoid membranes is called the thylakoid space. The light
harvesting reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes, and the synthesis of sugar takes place in the fluid inside
the inner membrane, which is called the stroma. Chloroplasts also have their own genome, which is contained on a
single circular chromosome.
The chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which captures the light energy that drives the r
