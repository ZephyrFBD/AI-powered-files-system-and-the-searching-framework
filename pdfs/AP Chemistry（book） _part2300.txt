ely. Termolecular elemen-
tary reactions are very rare. Unimolecular, bimolecular, and termo-
lecular reactions follow rate laws that are first order overall, second 
order overall, and third order overall, respectively.
Many reactions occur by a multistep mechanism, involving two 
or more elementary reactions, or steps. An intermediate is produced 
in one elementary step and is consumed in a later elementary step, 
therefore it does not appear in the overall equation for the reaction. 
When a mechanism has several elementary steps, the overall rate is 
limited by the slowest elementary step, called the rate-determining 
step. A fast elementary step that follows the rate-determining step will 
have no effect on the rate law of the reaction. A fast step that precedes 
the rate-determining step often creates an equilibrium that involves 
an intermediate. For a mechanism to be valid, the rate law predicted 
by the mechanism must be the same as that observed experimentally.
