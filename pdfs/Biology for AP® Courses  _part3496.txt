Condyloid Joints
Condyloid joints consist of an oval-shaped end of one bone fitting into a similarly oval-shaped hollow of another bone
(Figure 29.30). This is also sometimes called an ellipsoidal joint. This type of joint allows angular movement along two

Saddle Joints
Saddle joints are so named because the ends of each bone resemble a saddle, with concave and convex portions that fit
together. Saddle joints allow angular movements similar to condyloid joints but
