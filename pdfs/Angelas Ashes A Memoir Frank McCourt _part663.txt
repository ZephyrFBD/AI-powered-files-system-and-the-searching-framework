wiping his mouth and 
 
 hands with the blanket. He looks at me,That face is all swole.Did you 
 
 fall on that face? 
 
 I tell him I did because there’s no use telling him anything else.He 
 
 wouldn’t understand. He says,You can stay in me mother’s bed tonight. 
 
 You can’t walk the streets with that face and them two red eyes in your 
 
 head. 
 
 He says there’s no food in the house, not a scrap of bread, and when 
 
 he falls asleep I take the greasy newspaper from the floor. I lick the front 
 
 page, which is all advertisements for films and dances in the city. I lick 
 
 the headlines. I lick the great attacks of Patton and Montgomery in 
 
 France and Germany. I lick the war in the Pacific. I lick the obituaries 
 
 and the sad memorial poems, the sports pages, the market prices of eggs 
 
 butter and bacon. I suck the paper till there isn’t a smidgen of grease. 
 
 I wonder what I’ll do tomorrow.
