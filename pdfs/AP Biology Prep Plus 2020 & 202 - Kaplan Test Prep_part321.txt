 of a South American tree. Poisoning by
tubocurarine can be reversed by the administration of a
cholinesterase inhibitor, which results in an increased
concentration of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleȇ. The inhibition
of muscle contraction by tubocurarine is most likely explained by
which of the following statements?

Signal transduction can occur in a variety of diﬀerent ways, depending on
which type of cell-surface receptor a hormone initially binds to. A typical
signal transduction pathway is shown below:
Tubocurarine prevents the release of acetylcholine from the
nerve ending, causing paralysis of the muscle.
(A)
Tubocurarine binds to the same site on the ion-gated channel
as acetylcholine in a competitive inhibition reaction and
causes paralysis of the muscle.
(B)
Tubocurarine blocks the influx of Na+ ions, which triggers the
release of calcium ions and contraction of the muscle.
(C)
Tubocurarine interferes with the contraction mechanism and
causes paralysis of the
