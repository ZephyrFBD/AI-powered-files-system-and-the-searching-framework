 double-stranded
DNA is cleaved, the cut ends are modified, and a new connection is made between the non-sister chromatids. As prophase
I progresses, the synaptonemal complex begins to break down and the chromosomes begin to condense. When the
synaptonemal complex is gone, the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each other at the centromere and at
chiasmata. The chiasmata remain until anaphase I. The number of chiasmata varies according to the species and the length
of the chromosome. There must be at least one chiasma per chromosome for proper separation of homologous chromosomes
during meiosis I, but there may be as many as 25. Following crossover, the synaptonemal complex breaks down and
the cohesin connection between homologous pairs is also removed. At the end of prophase I, the pairs are held together
only at the chiasmata (Figure 11.3) and are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous
chromosomes are now visible.
The crossover events are
