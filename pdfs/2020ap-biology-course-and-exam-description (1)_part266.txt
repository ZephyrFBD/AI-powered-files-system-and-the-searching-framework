Error Analysis
Students analyze an 
existing solution to 
determine whether

Allows students to 
troubleshoot errors and 
focus on solutions that may 
arise when they perform 
the same procedures 
themselves.

work to determine where there 
were errors in their calculations. 
For example, this can be done 
as part of the diffusion and 
osmosis lab, or when teaching 
chi-square or the Hardy-
Weinberg principle.
