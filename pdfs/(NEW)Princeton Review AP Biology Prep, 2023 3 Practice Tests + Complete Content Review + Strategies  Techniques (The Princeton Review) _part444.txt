invariably results in major changes at all the other levels.
Disrupting the Balance
Ecosystems are never exactly stable, existing in a precarious balance. Many things can disrupt the balance. If the
biomass at any level changes, this will affect the surrounding levels and spread throughout the ecosystem.
Geological changes, weather changes, new species, diseases, lack of resources, new resources, and many other
things can disrupt the balance.
Invasive species are particularly dangerous since they can severely disrupt the
balance of the ecosystem. This is often because they have no natural predator
or competition and soon expand and take resources from other species.
A diverse community is more likely to withstand extreme events. Simpson’s Diversity Index is a measure of the
diversity of a community.
Simpson’s Diversity Index
Diversity Index = 1 − Σ
n = the total number of organisms of a particular species
N = the total number of organisms of all species
