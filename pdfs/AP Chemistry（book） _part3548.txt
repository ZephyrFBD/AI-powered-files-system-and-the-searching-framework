tivity, large quantities of N2 are used as an inert gaseous 
blanket to exclude O2 in food processing, manufacture of chemicals, metal fabrication, 
and production of electronic devices. Liquid N2 is employed as a coolant to freeze foods 
rapidly.
The largest use of N2 is in the manufacture of nitrogen-containing fertilizers. These 
fertilizers provide a source of fixed nitrogen—nitrogen that has been incorporated into 
compounds. We have previously discussed nitrogen fixation in the “Chemistry and 
Life” box in Section 14.7 and in the “Chemistry Put to Work” box in Section 15.2. Our 
starting point in fixing nitrogen is the manufacture of ammonia via the Haber process. 
 (Section 15.2) The ammonia can then be converted into a variety of useful, simple 
nitrogen-containing species (Figure 22.21).
Hydrogen Compounds of Nitrogen
Ammonia is one of the most important compounds of nitrogen. It is a colorless, toxic gas 
that has a characteristic irritating odor. As noted in previous discuss
