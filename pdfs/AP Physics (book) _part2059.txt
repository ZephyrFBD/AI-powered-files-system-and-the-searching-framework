ust satisfy Ohm’s law too:
We now combine the equations above:
When we divide out the V from each term, we have
[parallel] (19;4)
For example, suppose you connect two 
loudspeakers in parallel to a single
set of output terminals of an amplifier. The equivalent resistance of the two 
“resistors” in parallel is
and so
Thus the net (or equivalent) resistance is less than each single
resistance. This may at first seem surprising. But remember that when you connect
resistors in parallel, you are giving the current additional paths to follow. Hence
the net resistance will be less.†
Equations 19–3 and 19–4 make good sense. Recalling Eq. 18–3 for resistivity,
we see that placing resistors in series effectively increases the length
and therefore the resistance; putting resistors in parallel effectively increases the
area through which current flows, thus reducing the overall resistance.
Note that whenever a group of resistors is replaced by the equivalent resistance,
current and voltage and pow
