 one atom per
mainly hydrogen atoms, and the temperature is about
2.7 K. Calculate the rms speed of these hydrogen atoms,
and the pressure (in atmospheres).
85. (a) Estimate the rms speed of an amino acid, whose molecular
mass is 89 u, in a living cell at 37°C. (b) What would be the
rms speed of a protein of molecular mass 85,000 u at 37°C?
86. The escape speed from the Earth is
so that
a gas molecule traveling away from Earth near the outer
boundary of the Earth’s atmosphere would, at this speed,
be able to escape from the Earth’s gravitational field and be
lost to the atmosphere. At what temperature is the rms
speed of (a) oxygen molecules, and (b) helium atoms 
equal to 
(c) Can you explain why our
atmosphere contains oxygen but not helium?
87. Consider a container of oxygen gas at a temperature of 23°C
that is 1.00 m tall. Compare the gravitational potential energy
of a molecule at the top of the container (assuming the
potential energy is zero at the bottom) with the average
