 peroxide formed from these reactions without letting it
into the cytoplasm where it can cause damage. Vesicles and vacuoles store substances, and in plant cells, the central vacuole
stores pigments, salts, minerals, nutrients, proteins, and degradation enzymes and helps maintain rigidity. In contrast, animal
cells have centrosomes and lysosomes but lack cell walls.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in
Big Idea 1, Big Idea 2, and Big Idea 4 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives listed in
the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory
experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam questions. A Learning Objective merges required content with one or
more of the seven Science Practices.
