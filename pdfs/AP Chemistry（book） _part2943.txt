e proposed change in pH, we can calculate the change in proton 
concentration needed and then figure out how much CaO is needed.
Solve
(a) The carbonate ion, which is the anion of a weak acid, is basic 
 (Sections 16.2 and 16.7) and so reacts with H+1aq2. If 
the concentration of H+1aq2 is low, the major product is the 
bicarbonate ion, HCO3
-. If the concentration of H+1aq2 is 
high, H2CO3 forms and decomposes to CO2 and H2O.  
 (Section 4.3)
(b) The initial and ﬁnal concentrations of H+1aq2 in the lake are 
obtained from their pH values:
3H+4initial = 10-5.0 = 1 * 10-5 M
[H+]final = 10-6.5 = 3 * 10-7 M
Using the lake volume, we can calculate the number of moles 
of H+1aq2 at both pH values:
 11 * 10-5 mol>L214.0 * 109 L2 = 4 * 104 mol
 13 * 10-7 mol>L214.0 * 109 L2 = 1 * 103 mol
Hence, the change in the amount of H+1aq2 is 
4 * 104 mol - 1 * 103 mol ≈4 * 104 mol.
Let’s assume that all the acid in the lake is completely 
ionized, so that only the free H+1aq2 contributing to the pH
