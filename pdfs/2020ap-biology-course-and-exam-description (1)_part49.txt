and function. 
Preparing for the AP Exam 
The AP Biology Exam requires students to 
make predictions and justify their reasoning in 
real-world scenarios. Students are expected 
to interpret and evaluate experimental results,  
analyze biological concepts and scientific 
investigations, and perform data analysis 
and statistical testing. 
A foundational concept for students to 
understand is that biological systems 
depend on relationships that, when 
compromised, can have far-reaching 
consequences within the system. These 
consequences can sometimes be 
deleterious for cells, organisms, and even 
ecosystems. This understanding will help 
students make and justify predictio
