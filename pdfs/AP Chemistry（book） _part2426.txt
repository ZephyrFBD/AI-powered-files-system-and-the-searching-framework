ilibrium concentra-
tions, we find negative concentrations of 
H2 and I2. Because a negative concentra-
tion is not chemically meaningful, we re-
ject this solution. We then use x = 0.935 
to find the equilibrium concentrations:
 
3H24 = 1.000 - x = 0.065 M
 
3I24 = 2.000 - x = 1.065 M
 
3HI4 = 2x = 1.87 M
Comment Whenever you use a quadratic equation to solve an 
equilibrium problem, one of the solutions to the equation will 
give you a value that leads to negative concentrations and thus is 
not chemically meaningful. Reject this solution to the quadratic 
equation.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
For the equilibrium Br21g2 + Cl21g2 ∆ 2 BrCl1g2, the equi-
librium constant Kp is 7.0 at 400 K. If a cylinder is charged 
with BrCl(g) at an initial pressure of 1.00 atm and the system is 
allowed to come to equilibrium what is the final (equilibrium) 
pressure of BrCl? (a) 0.57 atm (b) 0.22 atm (c) 0.45 atm 
 (d) 0.15 atm (e) 0.31 atm
