Interpretation of this Exercise
Starch is too large a molecule to escape through the pores of the dialysis bag. As a result, the content
of the dialysis bag turns from colorless to blue/black because the IKI from the beaker diffuses through
the pores and reacts with the starch (a positive test for starch). The beaker fluid stays yellowish
because no starch has diffused from the dialysis bag. Glucose is present in the beaker because it is a
smaller molecule than starch and diffuses through the dialysis bagâ€™s pore. Residual glucose is still in
the bag; thus, you continue to have a positive result for the bag.
