ibrium by using energy to manipulate
concentrations of reactants and products. To keep the reactions
running forward, cells use energy to import reactant molecules
(keeping them at high concentration) and/or use energy to export
product molecules (keeping them at low concentration). In the figure,
the reactions are linked by shared intermediates. Thus, increasing the
concentration of molecule A or decreasing the concentration of
molecule D in the cell will drive the pathway forward. The correct
answer is (A). (B) is incorrect because an increase in concentration of
molecule B in the cell would result from the cell consuming ATP to
increase the concentration of molecule A in the cell. (C) is incorrect
because an increase in the concentration of molecule C results from
consuming ATP. (D) is incorrect because, to drive the reactions
forward, the cell would use energy to decrease the concentration of
molecule D in the cell (increasing the concentration out of the cell).
