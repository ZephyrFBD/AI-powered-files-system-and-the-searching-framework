s, from the leaves to the rest of the plant.
Plant stems, whether above or below ground, are characterized by the presence of nodes and internodes (Figure 23.4).
Nodes are points of attachment for leaves, aerial roots, and flowers. The stem region between two nodes is called an
internode. The stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole. An axillary bud is usually found in
the axil—the area between the base of a leaf and the stem—where it can give rise to a branch or a flower. The apex (tip) of
the shoot contains the apical meristem within the apical bud.
Figure 23.4 Leaves are attached to the plant stem at areas called nodes. An internode is the stem region between two
nodes. The petiole is the stalk connecting the leaf to the stem. The leaves just above the nodes arose from axillary
buds.
Stem Anatomy
The stem and other plant organs arise from the ground tissue, and are primarily made up of simple tissues formed from three
types of cells: parenchyma, collen
