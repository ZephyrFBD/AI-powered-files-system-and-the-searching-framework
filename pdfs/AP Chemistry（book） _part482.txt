riment? Donâ€™t worry too much 
about the exact apparatus you need for the Design an Experiment ex-
ercises. The goal is to imagine what you would need to do, or what 
kind of data you would need to collect, in order to answer the ques-
tion. If your instructor allows it, you can collaborate with others in 
your class to develop ideas. Scientists discuss their ideas with other 
scientists all the time. We find that discussing ideas, and refining 
them, makes us better scientists and helps us collectively answer im-
portant questions.
The design and interpretation of scientific experiments is at the 
heart of the scientific method. Think of the Design an Experiment 
exercises as puzzles that can be solved in various ways, and enjoy 
your explorations!

The theoretical yield, which is the calculated quantity of 
adipic acid formed, can be calculated using the sequence of 
conversions shown in Figure 3.16.
