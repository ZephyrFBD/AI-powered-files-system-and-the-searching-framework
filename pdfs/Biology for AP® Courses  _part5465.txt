 felt at one with the natural world. Then a ‘Green’
organisation, the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust, took
over part of the land and proceeded to cut down a large number of
trees, including mature ones, to install a horrible big, bright steel
‘this-is-ours-stay-out’ fence that destroyed the whole atmosphere of
this beautiful place. No one with a feel for nature would do that. Day
aĞer day I walked to the sound of chainsaws and a magniﬁcent
mature weeping willow tree that I so admired was cut down at the
base of the trunk. When I challenged a Woke young girl in a green
shirt (of course) about this vandalism she replied: ‘It’s a weeping
willow – it will grow back.’ This is what people are paying for when
they donate to the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust and
many other ‘green’ organisations today. It is not the environmental
movement that I knew and instead has become a support-system –
as with Extinction Rebellion – for a very dark agenda.
