 words, each glucose results in a net gain of two ATP. Therefore, two glucose molecules
would result in a net gain of four ATP.

B
In fermentation, pyruvic acid is converted into either ethanol or lactic acid. During this process, NADH is
recycled into NAD+.
6.
B
Glycolysis results in the production of ATP (energy), so it is considered an exergonic process.
7.
B
Thermophilic bacteria live in hot environments. Also, a DNA polymerase replicates DNA. Therefore, in
the PCR technique, the stage in which DNA is elongated by a DNA polymerase is part three of the cycle,
at 72°C. Therefore, bacteria growing in hydrothermal vents between 70–75°C is the answer. The
conditions described in (A) and (D) do not reflect the data, which focuses on temperature. Choice (C)
describes hot springs, but the temperature does not reflect the enzyme activity most likely for Taq
polymerase.

D
The free energy does not change between catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions; therefore, (A) is incorrect.
Choice (B)
