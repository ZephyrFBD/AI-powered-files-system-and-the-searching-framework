side if the elevator is at rest or moving at constant velocity (Fig. 33–13a).
If instead the elevator is accelerating upward, as in Fig. 33–13b, the light beam
still travels straight across in a reference frame at rest. In the upwardly accelerating
elevator, however, the beam is observed to curve downward. Why? Because
during the time the light travels from one side of the elevator to the other, the
elevator is moving upward at a vertical speed that is increasing relative to the
light. Next we note that according to the equivalence principle, an upwardly accel-
erating reference frame is equivalent to a downward gravitational field. Hence,
we can picture the curved light path in Fig. 33–13b as being due to the effect of a
gravitational field. Thus, from the principle of equivalence, we expect gravity to
exert a force on a beam of light and to bend it out of a straight-line path!
That light is affected by gravity is an important prediction of Einstein’s
general theory of relativity. And
