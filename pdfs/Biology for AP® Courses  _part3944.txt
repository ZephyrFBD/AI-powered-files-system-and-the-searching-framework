roduces some cytokines that allows memory B cells to recognize the pathogen and produce
antibodies to fight against the pathogen.
If the pathogen is never encountered again during the individual’s lifetime, B and T memory cells will circulate for a few
years or even several decades and will gradually die off, having never functioned as effector cells. However, if the host is
re-exposed to the same pathogen type, circulating memory cells will immediately differentiate into plasma cells and CTLs
without input from APCs or TH cells. One reason the adaptive immune response is delayed is because it takes time for naïve

B and T cells with the appropriate antigen specificities to be identified and activated. Upon reinfection, this step is skipped,
and the result is a more rapid production of immune defenses. Memory B cells that differentiate into plasma cells output tens
