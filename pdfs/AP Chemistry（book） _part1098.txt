the first 54 elements, the trends we observe in first ionization ener-
gies as we move from one element to another in the periodic table. The important trends 
are as follows:
1. I1 generally increases as we move left to right across a period. The alkali metals show 
the lowest ionization energy in each period, and the noble gases show the highest. 
There are slight irregularities in this trend that we will discuss shortly.
2. I1 generally decreases as we move down any column in the periodic table. For example, the 
ionization energies of the noble gases follow the order He 7 Ne 7 Ar 7 Kr 7 Xe.
3. The s- and p-block elements show a larger range of I1 values than do the transition-metal 
elements. Generally, the ionization energies of the transition metals increase slowly 
from left to right in a period. The f-block metals (not shown in Figure 7.10) also show 
only a small variation in the values of I1.
In general, smaller atoms have higher ionization energies. The same factors that
