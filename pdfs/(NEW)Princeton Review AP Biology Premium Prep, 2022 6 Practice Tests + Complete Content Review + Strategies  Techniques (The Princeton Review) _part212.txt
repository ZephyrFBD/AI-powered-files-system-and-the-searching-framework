6. A lipid-soluble hormone, estrogen, is secreted from the ovaries. This molecule travels through the body via the
bloodstream. A researcher was interested in reducing estrogenâ€™s effect in order to determine the response of
decreased estrogen on the organism. Which of the following is a valid strategy for reducing effects of estrogen
on the whole research organism?
(A) Treat with a competitive inhibitor drug that blocks all receptors at the plasma membrane
(B) Treat with lipid-soluble testosterone
(C) Treat with a lipid-soluble noncompetitive inhibitor that specifically reduces estrogen binding to the
intracellular receptor
(D) Remove ovaries of the organism
7. Which type of cell would be the most useful for studying the rough endoplasmic reticulum?
(A) Neurons firing action potentials
(B) Insulin-making cells in the pancreas
(C) Bacterial cells in a colony
(D) White blood cells
8. Paramecium is a single-celled protist that lives in freshwater habitats.
