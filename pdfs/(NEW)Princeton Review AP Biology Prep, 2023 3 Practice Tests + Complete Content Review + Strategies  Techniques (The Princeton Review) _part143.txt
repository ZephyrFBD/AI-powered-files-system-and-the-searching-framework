nts, 96% of the mass of all living things is made up of just four of them: oxygen
(O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). These four elements are used to build biological molecules, such
as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. They are also used to form storage compounds and cells in all
organisms. Other elements such as calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulfur (S), sodium (Na), chlorine
(Cl), and magnesium (Mg) are also present, but in smaller quantities. These elements make up most of the remaining
four percent of a living thingâ€™s weight. Some elements are known as trace elements because they are required by an
organism only in very small quantities. Trace elements include iron (Fe), iodine (I), and copper (Cu).
Where Are They Found?
Carbon and hydrogen and oxygen are found in all the macromolecules
(essentially, very big molecules). Nitrogen is found in proteins and nucleic
acids. Phosphorus is found in nucleic acids and some lipids.
