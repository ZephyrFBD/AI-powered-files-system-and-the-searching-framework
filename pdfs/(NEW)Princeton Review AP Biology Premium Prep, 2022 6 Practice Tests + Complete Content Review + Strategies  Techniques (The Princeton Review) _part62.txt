 found on Earth due to the lack of strong bonds holding it together,
which also ties into the melting and boiling points decreasing instead of increasing. The polarity of water
allows it to hydrogen bond and form a less dense solid, so (D) describes what would happen if the polarity
changed.

The wind speed, tree height, and altitude do not tie directly into the function of the jaw and the size of the
opening. Only the size of seeds that the mice eat would directly relate to the mouth size.

It says in the passage that the mice are the same species. This means they should be able to mate with
each other. As we do not know anything about the genetics and inheritance of jaw angle, it is not possible
to predict how the jaw angle would be affected.

Since the jaw angle on island B is now large, the smaller jaw angle must have disappeared. The small jaw
angle is likely selected against, and only mice with large jaws survive on Island B. The survival on the
other islands is no
