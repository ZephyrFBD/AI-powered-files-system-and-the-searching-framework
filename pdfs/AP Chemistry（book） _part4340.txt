re A measure of the force exerted on a unit area. In 
chemistry, pressure is often expressed in units of atmospheres 
(atm) or torr: 760 torr =  1 atm; in SI units pressure is expressed in 
pascals (Pa). (Section 10.2)
pressure–volume (PV) work Work performed by expansion of a 
gas against a resisting pressure. (Section 5.3)
primary cell A voltaic cell that cannot be recharged. 
(Section 20.7)
primary structure The sequence of amino acids along a protein 
chain. (Section 24.7)
primitive lattice A crystal lattice in which the lattice points are 
located only at the corners of each unit cell. (Section 12.2)
principal quantum number The integer, n, associated with orbits 
and energy levels in the Bohr atom. (Section 6.3)
probability density 1C22 A value that represents the probability 
that an electron will be found at a given point in space. Also 
called electron density. (Section 6.5)
product A substance produced in a chemical reaction; it appears 
to the right of the arrow in a chemica
