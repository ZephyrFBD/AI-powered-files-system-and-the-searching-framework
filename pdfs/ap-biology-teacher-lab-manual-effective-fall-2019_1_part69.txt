Begin by exploring the lab you want to modify. Think about the following question as 
you read the lab: What characteristics make this lab “cookbook” rather than inquiry? Once 
you have a list of characteristics, write down three to five that you’d like to modify. It’s 
a good idea to incorporate the NRC inquiry model into this step. Ask yourself, At what

and their subprocesses (see Appendix D). MAPSI is a particularly u
