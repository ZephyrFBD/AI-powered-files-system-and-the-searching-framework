Figure 2.18 The ball-and-stick model. Figure 2.19 The elements 
are in the following groups: Ag+ is 1B, Zn2+ is 2B, and Sc3+ is 3B. Only 
Sc3+ has the same number of electrons as a noble gas, Ar (element 
18). Figure 2.20 No it is not, ionic solids like NaCl do not contain 
discrete molecules. Figure 2.23 Removing one O atom from the 
perbromate ion gives the bromate ion, BrO3

Figure 3.4 There are two CH4 and four O2 molecules on the reac-
tant side, which contain 2 C atoms, 8 H atoms and 8 O atoms. The 
number of each type of atom remains the same on the product side 
as it must. Figure 3.8 The flame gives off heat and therefore the 
reaction must release heat. Figure 3.9  Avogadroâ€™s number

H2 is doubled then O2 becomes the limiting reactant. In that case 
17 mol O22 *  
12 mol H2O>1 mol O22 =  14 mol H2O would be pro-
duced.
