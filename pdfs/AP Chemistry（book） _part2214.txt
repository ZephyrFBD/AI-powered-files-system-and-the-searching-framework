der kinetics, as well as information about concentrations 
and times, and asked to calculate how much reactant (insecti-
cide) remains after 1 yr. We must also determine the time interval 
needed to reach a particular insecticide concentration.
Plan In part (a) we are given the rate constant, a period of time, 
and the initial concentration of the reactant, so we can use Equa-
tion 14.13 to determine the concentration of the reactant after  
1 year has passed.  In part (b) we are given the initial and final con-
centrations and the rate constant.  In this case we can use Equa-
tion 14.13 to calculate the time that must pass to reach the desired 
concentration.
Solve
(a) Substituting the known quantities into Equation 14.13, we have:
ln3insecticide4t = 1 yr = -11.45 yr-1211.00 yr2 + ln15.0 * 10-72
We use the ln function on a calculator to evaluate the second 
term on the right [that is, ln15.0 * 10-724, giving:
ln3insecticide4t = 1 yr = -1.45 + 1-14.512 = -15.96
To obtain 3insecticide4t
