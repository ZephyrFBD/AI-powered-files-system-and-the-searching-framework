o consideration. The 
blue line in the figure shows that infective rate will increase at first and reach 
the maximum value and then decline. Just like Improved ModelⅠ, the 
maximum of I(t) decrease a lot compared to the Basic Model. However, the 
reason is that drugs can directly deduct the number of infected people，while 
vaccines can firstly deduct the number of susceptible people remarkably, then, 
deduct the number of infected people. In comparisons among the three models, 
we have a conclusion that human intervention has huge impact on EVD. 
3.3.5 Strength and Weakness 
 Strength: Improved Model Ⅱ considers both two factors, including the 
drugs which have influence on the patient and the vaccines which have 
influence on the susceptible people. The assumption that the relationships 
between λ and t, μ and t are index is reasonable. At the same time, 
the model reflects clearly how the drugs and the vaccine work, which 
provides the world medical association with data when makin
