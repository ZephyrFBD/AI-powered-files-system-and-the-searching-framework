s are specialized leaf cells that control the opening and closing of stomata. They open to allow gas
exchange, but close when excessive transpiration from high temperatures or low humidity threatens the survival of
the leaf or plant.
Sunken stomata are stomata that occur in depressions below the surrounding surface of the leaf. Such stomata
reduce the rate of transpiration caused by air movement (wind) over the surface of the leaf.
Trichomes are plant hairs that can serve various functions. They can interfere with air movement or increase solar
reflection, both of which can reduce transpiration. Their presence may also reduce browsing by predators (insects
and mammals) or discourage egg laying by insects. Some glandular trichomes secrete toxic substances, making the
leaf surfaces additionally inhospitable.
4. Flowers are the reproductive organs of the plant. Gametes (eggs and pollen) are produced here. Pollination occurs
when wind or insects (or larger animals like bats) transfer polle
