Way. In (a), the thin line is the trail
of an artificial Earth satellite in this
long time exposure. The dark
diagonal area is due to dust
absorption of visible light, blocking
the view. In (b) the view is toward
the center of the Galaxy (taken in

Our Galaxy has a diameter of almost 100,000 light-years and a thickness of
roughly 2000 ly. It has a central bulge and spiral arms (Fig. 33–2). Our Sun, which
is a star like many others, is located about halfway from the galactic center to the
edge
