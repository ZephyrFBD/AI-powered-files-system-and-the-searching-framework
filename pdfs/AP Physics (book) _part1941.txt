1. Make a list of rules for and properties of equipotential sur-
faces or lines. You should be able to find eight distinct rules
in the text.
2. Figure 17–8 shows contour lines (elevations). Just for fun,
assume they are equipotential lines on a flat 2-dimensional
surface with the values shown being in volts. Estimate the
magnitude and direction of the “electric field” (a) between
Iceberg Lake and Cecile Lake and (b) at the Minaret Mine.
Assume that up is 
right is 
and that Cecile Lake is
about 1.0 km wide in the middle.
3. In lightning storms, the potential difference between the
Earth and the bottom of thunderclouds may be 35,000,000 V.
The bottoms of the thunderclouds are typically 1500 m above
the Earth, and can have an area of 
Modeling the
Earth–cloud system as a huge capacitor, calculate (a) the
capacitance of the Earth–cloud system, (b) the charge stored
in the “capacitor,”and (c) the energy stored in the “capacitor.”
4. The potential energy stored in a capac
