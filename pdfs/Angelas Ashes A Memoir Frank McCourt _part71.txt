he keeps offering to the bird, who just squawks and spits 
 
 blood at him.You’d wonder why Cuchulain puts up with a bird like 
 
 that. If the twins ever spat blood at me when I offered them a banana I 
 
 think I’d hit them on the head with it. 
 
 In the morning my father is at the kitchen table and I tell him 
 
  
  
 my dream. He says there were no bananas in Ireland in the old times 
 
 and even if there were Cuchulain would never offer one to that 
 
 bird because that was the one that came over from England for the 
 
 summer and perched on his shoulder when he was dying and propped 
 
 up against a stone and when the men of Erin which is Ireland wanted 
 
 to kill him they were afraid till they saw the bird drinking Cuchulain’s 
 
 blood and then they knew it was safe to attack him, the dirty 
 
 bloody cowards. So you have to be wary of birds, Francis, birds and 
 
 Englishmen.
