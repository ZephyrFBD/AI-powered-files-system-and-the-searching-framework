In other words, the factor should be 
greatly improved if its positive devotion to the sustainability is the biggest, which can 
be measured by our model. 
We select Haiti as our target country. We use our model to determine the 
sustainability of Haiti and draw the conclusion that Haiti is totally unsustainable. We 
carry out a feasible 20 year plan and are pleased to see that Haiti is developing 
towards the less unsustainable period or even less sustainable period by implementing 
our measures, which is predicted by our model. For the sake of rapid occurrence of 
natural hazards, we appeal Haiti to greatly improve their public health and education. 
After all, a stable society is the base of economy development and ecology restoration, 
especially to those LDC countries like Haiti. In one word, our model determines 
whether a country is sustainable and which measure is the most effective, helping to 
ultimate the goal to create a more sustainable world.
