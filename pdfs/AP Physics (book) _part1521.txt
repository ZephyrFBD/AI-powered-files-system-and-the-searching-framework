thermal equilibrium
is reached, meaning the entire system is at the same temperature. For an isolated
system, no energy is transferred into or out of it. So we can apply conservation of energy
to such an isolated system. A simple intuitive way to set up a conservation of energy
equation is to write that the heat lost by one part of the system is equal to the heat
gained by the other part:
[isolated system]
or
[isolated system]
 
energy out of one part = energy into another part.
 
heat lost = heat gained

The cup cools the tea. If 
of tea at 95°C is poured
into a 150-g glass cup initially at 25°C (Fig. 14–3), what will be the common final
temperature T of the tea and cup when equilibrium is reached, assuming no heat
