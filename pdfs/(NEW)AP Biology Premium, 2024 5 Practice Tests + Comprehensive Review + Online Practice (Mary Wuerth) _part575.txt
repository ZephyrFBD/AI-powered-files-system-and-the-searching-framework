(about 40 days). Also, since Fast Plants do not self-pollinate, the experimenter can control which plants
pollinate each other to produce offspring, which allows for artificial selection. In this experiment, the expression of a
quantifiable trait in a parental generation and in the F1 generation is compared after artificial selection.
Any quantifiable trait can be used in this experiment. One of the most common traits used is the number of
trichomes on plant leaves. Trichomes are short, hairlike appendages on the margins, or edges, of the leaves.
Trichomes deter predation of the plant by herbivores. The number of trichomes per leaf can vary greatly in a
population of Fast Plants, as shown in Figure 24.1.
Figure 24.1 Number of Trichomes per Leaf
Imagine that a class decides to artificially select for plants with the most trichomes. Fast Plants are grown from
stock seeds (parental generation), which reflect normal variation in the population. At day 11 of the plantsâ€™ life
cycle, the stud
