ctionless horizontal surface are 
in contact with each other as shown in Fig. 4–54. A force 
is applied to block A (mass 
). (a) Draw a free-body dia-
gram for each block. Determine (b) the acceleration of the
system (in terms of 
and 
), (c) the net force on
each block, and (d) the force of contact that each block
exerts on its neighbor. (e) If
and
give numerical answers to (b), (c), and (d).
Explain how your answers make sense intuitively.

the masses are released
and before one hits the
ground. Ignore the mass
