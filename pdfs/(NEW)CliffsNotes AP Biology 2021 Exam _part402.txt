 occurs as favorable traits accumulate in the population. The best adapted individuals survive and
leave offspring who inherit the traits of their parents. In turn, the best adapted of these offspring leave the most
offspring. Over time, traits best adapted for survival and reproduction, and the alleles that generate them, accumulate
in the population.
Natural selection may affect populations in a variety of ways. These are illustrated in Figure 10-1 and discussed
below. Note that in all cases, natural selection acts on individual phenotypes already present in the population.
Alleles may be expressed with other alleles in new combinations (as a result of genetic recombination) to create
novel phenotypes, or new phenotypes may appear in the population as a result of mutations. It is important to note
that natural selection does not cause mutations or create new phenotypes. It only “selects” phenotypes—already
present in the population—that maximize fitness.
