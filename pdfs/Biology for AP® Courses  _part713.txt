Figure 6.15 Enzymes lower the activation energy of the reaction but do not change the free energy of the reaction.
Enzyme Active Site and Substrate Specificity
The chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are the enzyme’s substrates. There may be one or more substrates,
depending on the particular chemical reaction. In some reactions, a single-reactant substrate is broken down into multiple
products. In others, two substrates may come together to create one larger molecule. Two reactants might also enter a
reaction, both become modified, and leave the reaction as two products. The location within the enzyme where the substrate
binds is called the enzyme’s active site. The active site is where the “action” happens, so to speak. Since enzymes are
proteins, there is a unique combination of amino acid residues (also called side chains, or R groups) within the active site.
Each residue is characterized by different proper
