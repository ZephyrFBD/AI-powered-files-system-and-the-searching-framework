ilosophical Magazine, 84, 2004) shows that selection
has conserved a bounding value in the product of these
parameters; the square root of all of the ratios of toughness
and elasticity lie above the dashed line. Patterns like this
lead to new science but, in applications to biomimetics,
they can also lead to improved technologies.

Biopolymers like collagen have higher toughness and
higher elasticity. Biominerals like enamel have lower
toughness but provide rigidity. Some organisms support
soft tissue by combining biopolymers and biomaterials.
Some rely more on biopolymers. Note that this is a
logarithm scale not a linear scale. So that the difference in
toughness of keratin and bone is roughly 100 and the
difference in rigidity of these to materials is nearly that
large.
A. Use this graph to pose questions about the fitness of
various biological solutions to the problem of capturing,
storing, and using free energy. (Remember that engineers
define “toughness” as the ability
