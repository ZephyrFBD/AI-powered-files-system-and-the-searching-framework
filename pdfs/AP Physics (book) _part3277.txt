29–9 Semiconductor Diodes, LEDs, OLEDs
Semiconductor diodes and transistors are essential components of modern elec-
tronic devices. The miniaturization achieved today allows many millions of diodes,
transistors, resistors, etc., to be fabricated (adding doping atoms) on a single chip
less than a millimeter on a side.
At the interface between an n-type and a p-type semiconductor, a pn junction
diode is formed. Separately, the two semiconductors are electrically neutral. But near
the junction, a few electrons diffuse from the n-type into the p-type semiconductor,
where they fill a few of the holes. The n-type is left with a positive charge, and 
the p-type acquires a net negative charge. Thus an “intrinsic” potential difference is
established, with the n side positive relative to the p side, and this pre
