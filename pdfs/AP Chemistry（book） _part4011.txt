6.65 (a) The hydrogen atom 1s and 2s orbitals have the same over-
all spherical shape, but the 2s orbital has a larger radial extension 
and one more node than the 1s orbital. (b) A single 2p orbital is 
directional in that its electron density is concentrated along one of 
the three Cartesian axes of the atom. The dx2 - y2 orbital has electron 
density along both the x- and y-axes, while the px orbital has density 
only along the x-axis. (c) The average distance of an electron from the 
nucleus in a 3s orbital is greater than for an electron in a 2s orbital. 
(d) 1s 6 2p 6 3d 6 4f 6 6s 6.67 (a) For the He+ ion, the 2s and 2p 
orbitals have the same energy. (b) Yes. In a helium atom, the 2s orbital 
is lower in energy than the 2p orbital. 6.69 (a) No. Both conﬁgura-
tions follow the Pauli exclusion principle. (b) No. Both conﬁgura-
tions follow Hund’s rule. (c) No. In the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, 
we cannot say which conﬁguration has the lower energy.
