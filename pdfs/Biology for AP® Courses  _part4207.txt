n) with some monthly variation. While
sunlight and temperature remain fairly consistent, annual rainfall is highly variable. Tropical wet forests have wet months in
which there can be more than 30 cm (11â€“12 in) of precipitation, as well as dry months in which there are fewer than 10 cm
(3.5 in) of rainfall. However, the driest month of a tropical wet forest still exceeds the annual rainfall of some other biomes,
such as deserts.
Tropical wet forests have high net primary productivity because the annual temperatures and precipitation values in
these areas are ideal for plant growth. Therefore, the extensive biomass present in the tropical wet forest leads to plant
communities with very high species diversities (Figure 35.13). Tropical wet forests have more species of trees than any
other biome; on average between 100 and 300 species of trees are present in a single hectare (2.5 acres) of South America.
One way to visualize this is to compare the distinctive horizontal layers within the
