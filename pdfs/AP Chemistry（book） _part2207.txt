he reaction, (b) the rate constant, (c) the rate of the reaction when 
3A4 = 0.050M and 3B4 = 0.100 M.
Solve
(a) If we compare experiments 1 and 2, we see that [A] is held 
constant and [B] is doubled. Thus, this pair of experiments 
shows how [B] affects the rate, allowing us to deduce the order 
of the rate law with respect to B.
Analyze We are given a table of data that relates concentrations of 
reactants with initial rates of reaction and asked to determine  
(a) the rate law, (b) the rate constant, and (c) the rate of reaction 
for a set of concentrations not listed in the table.

Sample Exercise 14.6
 Determining a Rate Law from Initial Rate Data
Plan (a) We assume that the rate law has the following form: 
Rate = k3A4m3B4n. We will use the given data to deduce the reac-
tion orders m and n by determini
