gnals from
multiple synapses are integrated at the axon
hillock, which then passes the signal into the
axon, where the signal is transferred to another
cell.
d.
A signal is released from the axon terminal,
passes through the axon, and synapse with
dendrites. Dendrites receive the signal as it
passes through the soma. Multiple signals from a
single synapse are integrated at the axon hillock,
which then passes the signal into the axon,
where the signal is transferred to another cell.
20. Transmission of signals between two neurons requires
proper communication between neurons. Dendrites are a
component of many neurons that facilitate signal
reception. Which of the following is true of dendrites?
a.
All neurons have several dendrites for signal
reception.
b.
Dendritic spines decrease possible synaptic
connections.
c.
Dendrites carry the signal to the soma.
d.
Chemical release at dendrites allows signal
communication to other cells.
