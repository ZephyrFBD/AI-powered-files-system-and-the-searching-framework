Structure
Amino acids are joined by peptide bonds, as shown in Figure 4.6. The resulting polypeptide chains have
directionality, with an amino (NH2) terminus and a carboxyl (COOH) terminus. The order of the amino acids in the
polypeptide chain determines the primary structure of the protein.

A change in the primary structure of a protein may have severe effects on the function of the protein, as seen in
sickle cell disease. Just one amino acid is changed out of over 140 amino acids in sickle cell hemoglobin.
Secondary Structure
Once the primary structure is formed, hydrogen bonds may form between adjacent amino acids in the polypeptide
chain. This drives the formation of the secondary structure of the protein. These secondary structures include alpha
helixes and beta-pleated sheets.
Tertiary Structure
Tertiary structure is the three-dimensional folded shape of the protein, often determined by the
hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions between R-groups in the polyp
