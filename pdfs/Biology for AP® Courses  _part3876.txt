Patients with kidney illnesses use dialysis machines to
remove harmful urea from their blood. The blood is
separated from a solution, called the dialysate, that is
designed to remove wastes by diffusion through a
semipermeable membrane. How does the concentration of
solutes likely differ between the upper component of the
dialyzer and the lower compartment, containing the fresh
dialysate, for the dialysis to successfully remove wastes
from the blood?
a.
In the upper component, the dialysate has a
higher solute concentration than the blood,
which allows the urea to diffuse to the lower
dialysate down its concentration gradient.
b.
In the upper component, the dialysate has a
lower solute concentration than the blood,
