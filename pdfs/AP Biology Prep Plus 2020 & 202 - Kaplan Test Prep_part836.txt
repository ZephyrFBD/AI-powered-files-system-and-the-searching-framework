ough cellular respiration, making it important for
organisms to be able to carry out metabolism.
(A)
Ammonia can be broken down to release heat, making it
important in thermoregulation within the lake.
(B)
Ammonia plays a role in the nitrogen cycle, making nitrogen
available for organisms, such as plants and animals.
(C)
Ammonia is a major source of energy for producers and a
component of the nitrogen cycle, so its presence is suﬀicient
to promote the growth of photoautotrophs.

2. A study investigated how various disturbances aﬀect coral reef
recovery. Data from the study is shown in the graphs below. The
asterisks represent disturbances that may aﬀect the amount of
coral.
Which of the following is most justified based on this data?
