electric charges. What factors affect the magnitude of this force? To find an
answer, the French physicist Charles Coulomb (1736–1806) investigated electric
forces in the 1780s using a torsion balance (Fig. 16–13) much like that used by
Cavendish for his studies of the gravitational force (Chapter 5).
Precise instruments for the measurement of electric charge were not available
in Coulomb’s time. Nonetheless, Coulomb was able to prepare small spheres with
different magnitudes of charge in which the ratio of the charges was known.†
Although he had some difficulty with induced charges, Coulomb was able to
argue that the electric force one tiny charged object exerts on a second tiny charged
object is directly proportional to the charge on each of them. That is, if the charge
on either one of the objects is doubled, the force is doubled; and if the charge 
on both of the objects is doubled, the force increases to four times the original
value. This was the case when the distance between th
