mol.
Check A molar mass below 250 seems reasonable based on the 
earlier examples we have encountered, and grams per mole is the 
appropriate unit for the molar mass.
Solve Using 1 mol C6H12O6 = 180.0 g C6H12O6 to write the appro-
priate conversion factor, we have
Moles C6H12O6 = 15.380 g C6H12O62a
1 mol C6H12O6
180.0 g C6H12O6
b
= 0.02989 mol C6H12O6
Our body converts most of the food we eat into glucose. After diges-
tion, glucose is delivered to cells via the blood. Cells need glucose to 
live, and the hormone insulin must be present in order for glucose 
to enter the cells. Normally, the body adjusts the concentration of 
insulin automatically, in concert with the glucose concentration 
after eating, so that normal blood glucose levels are 70â€“120 mg/dL. 
However, in a diabetic person, either little or no insulin is produced 
(Type 1 diabetes) or insulin is produced but the cells cannot take it up 
properly (Type 2 diabetes). In either case the blood glucose levels are 
higher than
