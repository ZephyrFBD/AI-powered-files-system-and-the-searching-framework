organisms that have been long-separated by a river which
prevents interbreeding. The two populations differ in
coloration, as shown in the diagram. Recent human

activity has caused the river to dry, however, resulting in
the two populations shown in the lower diagram. What is
the most likely explanation for this change?
a.
an increase in gene flow between the two
populations
b.
a decrease in gene flow between the two
populations
c.
an increase in non-random mating between the
two populations
d.
a decrease in non-random mating between the
two populations
40. Antibiotics are medicines that are designed to kill
disease-causing organisms, or pathogens. However, some
pathogens evolve antibiotic resistance, where they gain
traits that allow them to survive in the presence of
antibiotics. The ability of bacteria to adapt to antibiotics so
