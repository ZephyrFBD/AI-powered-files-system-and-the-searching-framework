nts are attached. The myosin filaments,
with their protruding heads, are located between the actin, unattached to the Z-line.

Muscle contraction is described by the sliding-filament model, as follows:
1. ATP binds to a myosin head and forms ADP + P i. When ATP binds to a myosin head, it is converted to ADP
and Pi, which remain attached
to the myosin head. The energy from the hydrolysis of ATP puts the myosin head into its high energy state, a
condition that prepares it for binding to actin.
2. Ca2+ exposes the binding sites on the actin filaments. Ca2+ binds to
 
the troponin molecule, causing tropomyosin to expose positions on the actin filament for the attachment of myosin
heads.
3. Cross bridges between myosin heads and actin filaments form. When attachment sites on the actin are
exposed, the myosin heads bind to actin to form cross bridges.
4. ADP and P i are released, and sliding motion of actin results. The attachment of cross bridges between myosin
and actin causes t
