Because hydrogen is a major constituent of aqueous body ﬂuids 
and fatty tissue, the hydrogen nucleus is the most convenient one 
for study by MRI. In MRI a person’s body is placed in a strong mag-
netic ﬁeld. By irradiating the body with pulses of radiofrequency 
radiation and using sophisticated detection techniques, medical 
technicians can image tissue at speciﬁc depths in the body, giving 
pictures with spectacular detail (Figure 6.28). The ability to sam-
ple at different depths allows the technicians to construct a three- 
dimensional picture of the body.
MRI has had such a profound inﬂuence on the modern prac-
tice of medicine that Paul Lauterbur, a chemist, and Peter Mansﬁeld, 
a physicist, were awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or 
Medicine for their discoveries concerning MRI. The major drawback 
of this technique is expense: The current cost of a new standard MRI 
instrument for clinical applications is typically $1.5 millio
