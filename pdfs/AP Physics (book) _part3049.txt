Rydberg constant, has the value 
Later it was found that
this Balmer series of lines extended into the UV region, ending at 
as shown in Fig. 27–24. Balmer’s formula, Eq. 27–9, also worked for these lines
with higher integer values of n. The lines near 365 nm become too close together
to distinguish, but the limit of the series at 365 nm corresponds to 
(so
in Eq. 27–9).
Later experiments on hydrogen showed that there were similar series of lines
in the UV and IR regions, and each series had a pattern just like the Balmer
series, but at different wavelengths, Fig. 27–25. Each of these series was found to
