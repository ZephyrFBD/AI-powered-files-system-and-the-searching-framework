t is found here and there in
membranes. It generally increases membrane fluidity, except at very high temperatures when it helps to hold things
together instead. Cholesterol is also important for making certain types of hormones and for making vitamin D. Here
are some examples:
Nucleic Acids
The fourth class of organic compounds is the nucleic acids. Like proteins, nucleic acids contain carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, and nitrogen, but nucleic acids also contain phosphorus. Nucleic acids are molecules that are made up of
simple units called nucleotides. For the AP Biology Exam, you’ll need to know about two kinds of nucleic acids:
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA).
Need-to-Know Nucleic Acids
For the AP Biology Exam, you’ll be expected to know about two types of
nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, which are shown here.
DNA is important because it contains the hereditary “blueprints” of all life. RNA is important because it’s essential
for protein synthesis. We’ll discuss DNA and
