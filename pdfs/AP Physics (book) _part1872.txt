e to flow) less readily than air,
so higher voltages can be applied without charge passing across the gap. Further-
more, a dielectric allows the plates to be placed closer together without touching,
thus allowing an increased capacitance because d is smaller in Eq. 17–8. Thirdly,
it is found experimentally that if the dielectric fills the space between the two con-
ductors, it increases the capacitance by a factor K, known as the dielectric constant.
Thus, for a parallel-plate capacitor,
(17;9)
This can be written
where
is called the permittivity of the material.
The values of the dielectric constant for various materials are given in Table 17–3.
Also shown in Table 17–3 is the dielectric strength, the maximum electric field
before breakdown (charge flow) occurs.
