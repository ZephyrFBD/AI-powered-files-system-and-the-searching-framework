chromosome and the genes on this chromosome are always expressed. Therefore, males will always have
Lowe disease if their X chromosome carries the Lowe disease gene. The location of the mutated gene, as
well as the locations of many other mutations that cause genetic diseases, has now been identified. Through
prenatal testing, a woman can find out if the fetus she is carrying may be afflicted with one of several genetic
diseases.
Geneticists analyze the results of prenatal genetic tests and may counsel pregnant women on available
options. They may also conduct genetic research that leads to new drugs or foods, or perform DNA analyses
that are used in forensic investigations.

Lysosomes
In addition to their role as the digestive component and organelle-recycling facility of animal cells, lysosomes are
considered to be parts of the endomembrane system. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to destroy pathogens
(disease-causing organisms) that might en
