pted and the
structure of the enzyme can be altered. For most enzymes, the optimal pH is at or near a pH of 7.
Other enzymes operate at a low pH. For instance, pepsin, the digestive enzyme found in the stomach, is most
effective at an extremely acidic pH of 2. The enzymes in the lysosome also function best in an acidic pH.
Relative Concentration of Substrates and Products
The relative concentration of substrates and products can also affect the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. For
example, an increase in substrate concentration will initially speed up the reaction. However, once all of the enzyme
in solution is bound by substrate, the reaction can no longer speed up. This concentration of substrate where all of
the enzyme in a reaction is bound by substrate is called the saturation point. Additional substrate past this point
will no longer increase the speed of the reaction.
Enzyme Regulation
We know that enzymes control the rates of chemical reactions. But what regulates the acti
