r attraction between like substances. Water cohesion results from the polarity of water molecules,
which causes hydrogen bonding to occur between adjacent water molecules. As a result, the water molecules within
a series of xylem cells behave as a single, polymer-like molecule.
Tension, or negative water pressure, develops as water transpires from the leaf. As water molecules leave the
surface of leaf cells, new molecules are pulled in to replace them because they are both attached (by cohesion) to the
adjacent transpiring water molecules and attracted (by adhesion) to the walls of the cells. As the movement of water
molecules is transmitted down the plant, water moves by bulk flow through the xylem by the pulling action
generated by transpiration. Since transpiration is caused by the heating action of the sun, the sun, then, is the driving
force for the ascent of water and dissolved minerals through plants.
When water availability is limited, inadequate supplies of water to cells may
