 me. Plainly the only way to learn about such 
remarkable kinds of action is to see the results, to experiment, to work in the laboratory.*

Separation of Mixtures
We can separate a mixture into its components by taking advantage of differences in 
their properties. For example, a heterogeneous mixture of iron filings and gold filings 
could be sorted by color into iron and gold. A less tedious approach would be to use a 
magnet to attract the iron filings, leaving the gold ones behind. We can also take advan-
tage of an important chemical difference between these two metals: Many acids dissolve 
iron but not gold. Thus, if we put our mixture into an appropriate acid, the acid would 
dissolve the iron and the solid gold would be left behind. The two
