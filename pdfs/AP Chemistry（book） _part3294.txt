ten salt (the “electrolyte”) using a 
cell similar to the one shown here. (a) What is the most 
common oxidation number for Mg when it is part of a salt? 
(b) Chlorine gas is evolved as voltage is applied in the cell. 
Knowing this, identify the electrolyte. (c) Recall that in an 
electrolytic cell the anode is given the + sign and the cath-
ode is given the – sign, which is the opposite of what we see 
in batteries. What half-reaction occurs at the anode in this 
electrolytic cell? (d) What half-reaction occurs at the cath-
ode? [Section 20.9]
