cessary for genome replication. The characteristics of each group in the Baltimore classification are
summarized in Table 21.3 with examples of each group.
Baltimore Classification
Group
Characteristics
Mode of mRNA Production
Example
I
Double-stranded
DNA
mRNA is transcribed directly from the DNA template
Herpes simplex
(herpesvirus)
II
Single-stranded
DNA
DNA is converted to double-stranded form before RNA is
transcribed
Canine
parvovirus
(parvovirus)
III
Double-stranded
RNA
mRNA is transcribed from the RNA genome
Childhood
gastroenteritis
(rotavirus)
IV
Single stranded
RNA (+)
Genome functions as mRNA
Common cold
(pircornavirus)
V
Single stranded
RNA (-)
mRNA is transcribed from the RNA genome
Rabies
(rhabdovirus)
VI
Single stranded
RNA viruses with
reverse
transcriptase
Reverse transcriptase makes DNA from the RNA
genome; DNA is then incorporated in the host genome;
mRNA is transcribed from the incorporated DNA
Human
immunodeficiency
virus (HIV)
VII
Double stranded
DNA viruses with
