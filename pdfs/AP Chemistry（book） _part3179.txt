es as the cell operates. At the same time, the Cu electrode gains 
mass, and the Cu2+1aq2 solution becomes less concentrated as Cu2+1aq2 is reduced to Cu(s).
For a voltaic cell to work, the solutions in the two half-cells must remain electrically neu-
tral. As Zn is oxidized in the anode half-cell, Zn2+1aq2 ions enter the solution, upsetting the 
initial Zn2+>SO4
2- charge balance. To keep the solution electrically neutral, there must be some 
means for Zn2+1aq2 cations to migrate out of the anode half-cell and for anions to migrate in. 
Similarly, the reduction of Cu2+1aq2 at the cathode removes these cations from the solution, 
leaving an excess of SO4
2- anions in that half-cell. To maintain electrical neutrality, some of 
these anions must migrate out of the cathode half-cell, and positive ions must migrate in. In 
fact, no measurable electron flow occurs between electrodes unless a means is provided for ions 
to migrate through the solution from one half-cell to the other, thereby
