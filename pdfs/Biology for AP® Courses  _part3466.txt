ore ossified vertebral column became common in terrestrial tetrapods because it reduces strain while
providing the strength needed to support the body’s weight. In later tetrapods, the vertebrae began allowing
for vertical motion rather than lateral flexion. Another change in the axial skeleton was the loss of a direct
attachment between the pectoral girdle and the head. This reduced the jarring to the head caused by the
impact of the limbs on the ground. The vertebrae of the neck also evolved to allow movement of the head
independently of the body.
The appendicular skeleton of land animals is also different from aquatic animals. The shoulders attach to the
pectoral girdle through muscles and connective tissue, thus reducing the jarring of the skull. Because of a
lateral undulating vertebral column, in early tetrapods, the limbs were splayed out to the side and movement
occurred by performing “push-ups.” The vertebrae of these animals had to move side-to-side in a similar
manner to fis
