ic) tRNAs and rRNAs also undergo processing before they can function as components in the protein
synthesis machinery.
mRNA Processing
The eukaryotic pre-mRNA undergoes extensive processing before it is ready to be translated. The additional steps involved
in eukaryotic mRNA maturation create a molecule with a much longer half-life than a prokaryotic mRNA. Eukaryotic
mRNAs last for several hours, whereas the typical E. coli mRNA lasts no more than five seconds.
Pre-mRNAs are first coated in RNA-stabilizing proteins; these protect the pre-mRNA from degradation while it is processed
and exported out of the nucleus. The three most important steps of pre-mRNA processing are the addition of stabilizing
and signaling factors at the 5' and 3' ends of the molecule, and the removal of intervening sequences that do not specify the
appropriate amino acids. In rare cases, the mRNA transcript can be “edited” after it is transcribed.
