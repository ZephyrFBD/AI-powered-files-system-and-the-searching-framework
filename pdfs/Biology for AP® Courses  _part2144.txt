Genetic Drift
The theory of natural selection stems from the observation that some individuals in a population are more likely to survive
longer and have more offspring than others; thus, they will pass on more of their genes to the next generation. A big,
powerful male gorilla, for example, is much more likely than a smaller, weaker one to become the population’s silverback,
the pack’s leader who mates far more than the other males of the group. The pack leader will father more offspring, who
share half of his genes, and are likely to also grow bigger and stronger like their father. Over time, the genes for bigger size
will increase in frequency in the population, and the population will, as a result, grow larger on average. That is, this would
occur if this particular
