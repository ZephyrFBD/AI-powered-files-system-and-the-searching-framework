econdary messenger, such as cyclic AMP, to initiate a
response from the nucleus.
Regardless of the type of chemical signal, the first thing that
happens in a receiving cell is transduction, where the chemical
message may be converted into a cascading signal transduction
pathway.

The illustration below shows a glass tube that contains two different
solutions of sugar separated by a selectively permeable membrane
(marked with an arrow), which allows for the diffusion of glucose
only.
Which of the following choices correctly describes what will occur
and gives supporting evidence for that occurrence?
Glucose will diffuse from side B to side A because molecules
flow down a gradient.
Water will flow from side A to side B because the water
potential (Î¨) is greater on side A.
There will be no net movement of molecules because the
concentration of glucose is greater on side A, while the
concentration of sucrose is
