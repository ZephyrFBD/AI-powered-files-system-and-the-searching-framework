by  
(Eq. 2–11c) after falling a
height h. It then has kinetic energy  
and if it strikes a
stake, it can do work on the stake equal to mgh (Section 6–3).
Thus, to raise an object of mass m to a height h requires an amount of work
equal to mgh (Eq. 6–5a). And once at height h, the object has the ability to do an
amount of work equal to mgh. We can say that the work done in lifting the object
has been stored as gravitational potential energy.
We therefore define the gravitational potential energy of an object, due to
Earth’s gravity, as the product of the object’s weight mg and its height y above
some reference level (such as the ground):
(6;6)
The higher an object is above the ground, the more gravitational potential energy
it has. We combine Eq. 6–5a with Eq. 6–6:
(6;7a)
That is, the change in potential energy when an object moves from a height 
to a
height 
is equal to the work done by a net external force to move the object
from position 1 to position 2 without acceleration.
