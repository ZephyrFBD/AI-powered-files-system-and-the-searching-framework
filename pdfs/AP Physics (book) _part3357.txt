, so that its mass is significantly less than
that of four separate nucleons. That helps the final state in 
decay to have less
total mass, thus allowing certain nuclides to decay which could not decay to,
say, 2 protons plus 2 neutrons. For example,
could not decay to 
because the masses of the daughter 
plus four separate nucleons is
.061721 u, which is greater
than the mass of the 
parent (232.037156 u). Such a decay would violate the
conservation of energy. Indeed, we have never seen 
Similarly, it is almost always true that the emission of a single nucleon is energet-
ically not possible; see Example 30–5.
Smoke Detectors—An Application
One widespread application of nuclear physics is present in nearly every home in
the form of an ordinary smoke detector. One type of smoke detector contains
about 0.2 mg of the radioactive americium isotope,
in the form of 
The radiation continually ionizes the nitrogen and oxygen molecules in
the air space between two oppositely charged plates. Th
