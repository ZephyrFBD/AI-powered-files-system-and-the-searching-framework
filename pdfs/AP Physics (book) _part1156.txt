nd also on the mass m that is oscillating. But—strange as it may
seem—the period does not depend on the amplitude. You can find this out for
yourself by using a watch and timing 10 or 20 cycles of an oscillating spring for a
small amplitude and then for a large amplitude.
The period T is given by (see derivation on next page):
(11;6a)
We see that the larger the mass, the longer the period; and the stiffer the spring
(larger k), the shorter the period. This makes sense since a larger mass means
more inertia and therefore slower response (smaller acceleration). And larger k
means greater force and therefore quicker response (larger acceleration). Notice
that Eq. 11–6a is not a direct proportion: the period varies as the square root
of m/k. For example, the mass must be quadrupled to double the period.
Equation 11–6a is fully in accord with experiment and is valid not only for a
spring, but for all kinds of simple harmonic motion—that is, for motion subject
to a restoring force proportion
