trophs are organisms that produce their own food
via photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, while heterotrophs, which are
unable to do so, must rely on other organisms for nutrition.
Lithotrophs obtain reducing elements from inorganic compounds,
while organotrophs obtain reducing elements from organic
compounds. Chemotrophs obtain energy from external chemical
compounds, while phototrophs obtain energy from light. When used
to describe an organism these terms are typically combined, such as
the “chemolithotrophic organisms” referenced in the stimulus.
Diﬀerent metabolic strategies yield diﬀerent levels of nutrients and
energy, thereby leading to variation in unrelated organisms’ abilities
 to grow, reproduce, and maintain homeostasis. (D) highlights one of
these metabolic diﬀerences and thus provides a reasonable
explanation for why growth, reproduction, and homeostasis
requirements may be met in diﬀerent ways. (A) is incorrect, despite
being a true statement, because the presence of intron
