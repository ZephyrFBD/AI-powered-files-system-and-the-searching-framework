heart. This type has
the advantage over battery-powered pacemakers in that surgery is not needed to
replace a battery when it wears out.
Self-Inductance
The concept of inductance applies also to an isolated single coil. When a changing
current passes through a coil or solenoid, a changing magnetic flux is produced
inside the coil, and this in turn induces an emf. This induced emf opposes the
change in flux (Lenzâ€™s law); it is much like the back emf generated in a motor.
(For example, if the current through the coil is increasing, the increasing mag-
netic flux induces an emf that opposes the original current and tends to retard 
its increase.) The induced emf 
is proportional to the rate of change in current
(and is in the direction opposed to the change, hence the minus sign):

The constant of proportionality L is called the self-inductance, or simply the
inductance of the coil. It, too, is measured in henrys. The magnitude of L depends
on the size and shape of the coil and on t
