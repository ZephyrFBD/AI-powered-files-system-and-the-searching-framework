c found in the rabbit
evolutionary history. The amniotic egg was
possessed by both the rabbit and lizard, but not
frogs, at some point in their evolutionary history.
c.
Hair is a characteristic only found in the rabbit
evolutionary history. The amniotic egg was
possessed by all three species at some point in
their evolutionary history.
d.
Hair was possessed by all three species at some
point in their evolutionary history. The amniotic
egg was possessed by both the lizard and frog,
but not the rabbit at some point in their
evolutionary history.

The tree above shows the phylogenetic relationships
between four species. A scientist wishes to perform a
genetic analysis on all four species in which she
determines the number of genetic similarities between all
four species. What would she likely find regarding the
genetic similarities between species A, B, D and E?
a.
Species D and E would share more genetic
similarities with each other than with species A
and B, and vice versa.
b.
