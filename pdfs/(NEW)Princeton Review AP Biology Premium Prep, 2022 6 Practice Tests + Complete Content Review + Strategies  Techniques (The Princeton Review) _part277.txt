laments).
A cell membrane forms around each cell, and the cell splits into two distinct daughter cells. The division of the
cytoplasm yields two daughter cells.
Here’s one thing to remember: cytokinesis occurs differently in plant cells. The cell doesn’t form a cleavage furrow.
Instead, a partition called a cell plate forms down the middle region.
Stage 5: Interphase
Once daughter cells are produced, they reenter the initial phase—interphase—and the whole process starts over. The
cell goes back to its original state. Once again, the chromosomes decondense and become invisible, and the genetic
material is called chromatin again.
But How Will I Remember All That?
For mitosis, you may already have your own mnemonic. If not, here’s a table with a mnemonic we created for you.
IPMAT
Interphase
I is for Interlude
Prophase
P is for Prepare
Metaphase
M is for Middle
Anaphase
A is for Apart
Telophase
T is for Two
Purpose of Mitosis
Mitosis achieves two things:
the production of daughter cells th
