39. (III) A scuba tank, when fully submerged, displaces 15.7 L
of seawater. The tank itself has a mass of 14.0 kg and,
when “full,”contains 3.00 kg of air. Assuming only its weight
and the buoyant force act on the tank, determine the net
force (magnitude and direction) on the fully submerged tank
at the beginning of a dive (when it is full of air) and at the end
of a dive (when it no longer contains any air).

floats on water.
What minimum mass of lead, hung from the wood by a
string, will cause the block to sink?
