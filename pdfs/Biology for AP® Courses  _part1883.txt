and their interactions within a species and with other species. Genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of
genes on each chromosome. The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate
streets. A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big
picture (similar to a map of interstate highways) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). A genetic marker is a
gene or sequence on a chromosome that co-segregates (shows genetic linkage) with a specific trait. Early geneticists called
this linkage analysis. Physical maps present the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes (similar to a detailed
road map). A physical map is a representation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers.
Both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome. Having a complete
