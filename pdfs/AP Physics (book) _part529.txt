mic nuclei); and 
(4) the weak nuclear force (involved in radioactivity). In this Chapter, we dis-
cussed the gravitational force in detail. The nature of the electromagnetic force
will be discussed in Chapters 16 to 22. The strong and weak nuclear forces, which
are discussed in Chapters 30 to 32, operate at the level of the atomic nucleus 
and are much less obvious in our daily lives.
Physicists have been working on theories that would unify these four forcesâ€”
that is, to consider some or all of these forces as different manifestations of the
same basic force. So far, the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces have been
theoretically united to form electroweak theory, in which the electromagnetic and
weak forces are seen as two aspects of a single electroweak force. Attempts to further
unify the forces, such as in grand unified theories (GUT), are hot research topics today.
But where do everyday forces fit? Ordinary forces, other than gravity, such as
pushes, pulls, and other contact
