lypeptide. Proteins serve many functions in cells. They act as enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions,
provide structural support, regulate the passage of substances across the cell membrane, protect against disease, and
coordinate cell signaling pathways. Protein structure is organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.
The primary structure is the unique sequence of amino acids. A change in just one amino acid can change protein structure
and function. For example, sickle cell anemia results from just one amino acid substitution in a hemoglobin molecule
consisting of 574 amino acids. The secondary structure consists of the local folding of the polypeptide by hydrogen
bond formation; leading to the α helix and β pleated sheet conformations. In the tertiary structure, various interactions,
e.g., hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, disulfide linkages, and hydrophobic interactions between R groups, contribute to the
folding of the polypeptide into different three-di
