xes, we make a quantification analysis to find a specific index to assess. Finally,
we use ‘even time’, ‘suffering degree’ and ‘wasting water’ to evaluate whether a
strategy is good or efficient to have a sensible and enjoyable hot bath.
Next, we use three hierarchical models to solve the problem. The first model is
called the ‘even loop model’, including the process of cooling and looping, which
extremely simplifies and clarifies the problem to describe the change of the
temperature. We regard the floating water as a river to model the movement of the
liquid and take the heat conduction and the time as well as the space into
consideration. The second model is called the ‘suffering degree model’. Based on the
theory of Weber-Fechner law, we successfully use temperature difference and
integration for curved surface to show whether people suffers from cold water. The
last model is the comprehensive evaluation model. Three key factors are weighted to
form a final index to evaluate whether
