the entire 360° of the circle which 
remain fixed as the source moves.

showing a cross section of a brain.
Photo (a) is of low resolution;
photo (b), of higher resolution, shows
a brain tumor, and uses false color to

To suggest how mathematical reconstruction is done, we consider a very simple
case using the iterative technique (“to iterate” is from the Latin “to repeat”).
Suppose our sample slice is divided into the simple 
pixels as shown in
Fig. 25–45. The number inside each pixel represents the amount of absorption by
the material in that area (say, in tenths of a
