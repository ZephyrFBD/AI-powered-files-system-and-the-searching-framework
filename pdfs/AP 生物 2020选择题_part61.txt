L amanitin solution 
(a) Describe the three structural components of an RNA nucleotide monomer. Explain the role of RNA 
polymerase during transcription. 
(b) Identify the dependent variable in the experiments. Identify a control group missing from the second 
experiment. Justify the need for this control group in the second experiment. 
(c) Describe the effect of amanitin on the maximum elongation rate for the wild-type and modified RNA 
polymerases. Determine the ratio of the average maximum elongation rate for the modified RNA polymerase 
compared to the wild strain RNA polymerase in Figure 1. 
(d) State the null hypothesis for the experiment in Figure 1. Provide reasoning to justify the claim that the 
change in the amino acid sequence in the modified RNA polymerase affected the shape of the active site on the 
enzyme.
