In the photo of Fig. 19–15, the above procedure is not being followed. Note
the safety error: with ground terminals connected, if the red clamp 
touches a metal part
, even if dropped by the person, a short circuit
with damaging high electric current can occur (hundreds of amps).

19–5 Circuits Containing Capacitors
in Series and in Parallel
Just as resistors can be placed in series or in parallel in a circuit, so can capacitors
(Chapter 17). We first consider a parallel connection as shown in Fig. 19–17. If
a battery supplies a potential difference V to points a and b, this same potential
difference 
exists across e
