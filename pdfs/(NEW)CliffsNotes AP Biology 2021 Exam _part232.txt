a cyclin-Cdk complex that advances the
cell cycle
through the G2 checkpoint. Each checkpoint has its own
 
combination of a specific Cdk and a specific cyclin that advances the cell cycle through the checkpoint.
Concentrations of different cyclins vary (“cycle”) during the cell cycle with a regular pattern. As the cell cycle
approaches each checkpoint, a specific cyclin combines with a specific Cdk. The conformation change that results
unblocks an active site on the Cdk, readying it for activation. If checkpoint conditions are met, the Cdk is activated,
often by phosphorylation, and the activated cyclin-Cdk complex initiates activity that advances the cell cycle
through the checkpoint. Once through the cycle phase, the cyclins are destroyed, and new cyclins, specific for the
next checkpoint, begin to accumulate.
Various external factors also influence the cell cycle:
1. Growth factors. The plasma membranes of cells have receptors for growth factors that stimulate a cell to divide.
