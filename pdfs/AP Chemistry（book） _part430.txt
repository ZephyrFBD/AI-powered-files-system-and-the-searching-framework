CHAPTER 3 Chemical Reactions and Reaction Stoichiometry
Molar Mass
A dozen is the same number, 12, whether we have a dozen eggs or a dozen elephants. 
Clearly, however, a dozen eggs does not have the same mass as a dozen elephants. Similarly, 
a mole is always the same number 16.02 * 10232, but 1-mol samples of different substances 
have different masses. Compare, for example, 1 mol of 12C and 1 mol of 24Mg. A single 12C 
atom has a mass of 12 amu, whereas a single 24Mg atom is twice as massive, 24 amu (to 
two significant figures). Because a mole of anything always contains the same number of 
particles, a mole of 24Mg must be twice as massive as a mole of 12C. Because a mole of 12C 
has a mass of 12 g (by definition), a mole of 24Mg must have a mass of 24 g. This example 
illustrates a general rule relating the mass of an atom to the mass of Avogadroâ€™s number 
 
(1 mol) of these atoms: The atomic weight of an element in atomic mass unit
