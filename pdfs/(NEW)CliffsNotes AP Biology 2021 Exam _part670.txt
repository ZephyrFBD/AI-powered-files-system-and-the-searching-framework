 able to coexist by occupying their
realized niches, that part of their existence where niche overlap is absent, that is, where they do not compete for the
same resources.
Under experimental conditions, one species of barnacle can live on rocks that are exposed to the full range of tides.
The full range, from the lowest to the highest tide levels, is its fundamental niche. In the natural environment,
however, a second species of barnacle outcompetes the first species, but only at the lower tide levels, where
desiccation is minimal. The first species, then, survives only in its realized niche, the higher tide levels.
4. Character displacement (niche shift). As a result of resource partitioning, certain characteristics may enable
individuals to obtain resources in their partitions more successfully. Selection for these characteristics reduces
competition with individuals in other partitions and leads to a divergence of features, or character displacement.
