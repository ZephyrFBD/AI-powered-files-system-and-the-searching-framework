Chelating agents are often used to prevent one or more of the customary reactions 
of a metal ion without removing the ion from solution. For example, a metal ion that 
interferes with a chemical analysis can often be complexed and its interference thereby 
removed. In a sense, the chelating agent hides the metal ion. For this reason, scientists 
sometimes refer to these ligands as sequestering agents.
Phosphate ligands, such as sodium tripolyphosphate, Na53OPO2OPO2OPO34, are 
used to sequester Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions in hard water so that these ions cannot interfere 
with the action of soap or detergents.
Chelating agents are used in many prepared foods, such as salad dressings and frozen 
desserts, to complex trace metal ions that catalyze decomposition reactions. Chelating 
agents are used in medicine to remove toxic heavy metal ions that have been ingested, 
such as Hg2+, Pb2+, and Cd2+. One method of treating lead poisoning, for example, is to 
administer Na2Ca(EDTA). T
