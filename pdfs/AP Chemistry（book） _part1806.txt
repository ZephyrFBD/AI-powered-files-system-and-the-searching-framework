more than 10 times larger than propa-
nol? (c)Â How do you explain the fact that water has the 
highest surface tension but the lowest viscosity?
 11.38  (a) Would you expect the viscosity of n-pentane, 
CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3, to be larger or smaller than the vis-
cosity of n-hexane, CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? (b) Would 
you expect the viscosity of neopentane, 1CH324C, to be 
smaller or larger than the viscosity of n-pentane? (See Fig-
ure 11.6 to see the shapes of these molecules.)
Phase Changes (Section 11.4)
 11.39  Name the phase transition in each of the following sit-
uations and indicate whether it is exothermic or endo-
thermic: (a) When ice is heated, it turns to water. (b) Wet 
clothes dry on a warm summer day. (c) Frost appears on a 
window on a cold winter day. (d) Droplets of water appear 
on a cold glass of lemonade.
 11.40  Name the phase transition in each of the following situa-
tions and indicate whether it is exothermic or endother-
mic: (a) Bromine vapor turns to bromine liquid a
