ach one of which is energetically equivalent to three
molecules of ATP), or a total of 54 ATP molecule equivalents required for the synthesis of one molecule of glucose. This
process is a fundamental and efficient way for cells to generate the molecular energy that they require.
Figure 6.3 Plants, like this oak tree, use energy from sunlight to make sugar and other organic molecules. Both plants
and animals, like this squirrel, use cellular respiration to derive energy from the organic molecules originally produced
by plants.
Metabolic Pathways
The processes of making and breaking down sugar molecules illustrate two types of metabolic pathways. A metabolic
pathway is a series of interconnected biochemical reactions that convert a substrate molecule or molecules, step-by-step,
through a series of metabolic intermediates, eventually yielding a final product or products. In the case of sugar metabolism,
the first metabolic pathway synthesized sugar from smaller molecules, and the other pa
