n the two sides of the arrow, and that you’ve  
chosen 
the smallest set of coefficients that balances the equation.
2 Na1s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡  2 NaOH1aq2 + H21g2
Balancing H in this way brings O into  
balance, but now Na is 
unbalanced, with one Na on the left and two on the right. To 
 
rebalance Na, we put the coefficient 2 in front of the reactant:
Na1s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡  2 NaOH1aq2 + H21g2
Although beginning this way does not balance H, it does increase 
the number of reactant H atoms, which we need to do. (Also, add-
ing the coefficient 2 on H2O unbalances O, but we will take care of 
that after we balance H.) Now that we have 2 H2O on the left, we 
 
balance H by putting the coefficient 2 in front of NaOH:
__ CH41g2 + __ Br21l2 ¡ __ CBr41s2 + __ HBr1g2
Once this equation is balanced, what is the value of the  
coefficient in front of bromine Br2?
(a) 1 (b) 2 (c) 3 (d) 4 (e) 6
