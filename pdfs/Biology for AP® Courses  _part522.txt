sed to
examine the ways in which a social system regulates itself.
Be prepared to share these in small group discussions with
your classmates about the similarities between these
regulatory strategies and the analogous roles of
plasmodesmata and gap junctions in cell communication.
66. Plasmodesmata in vascular plants and gap junctions in
animals are examples of specialized features of cells.
Mechanisms by which transport occurs between cells
evolved independently within several eukaryotic clades.
Explain, in terms of cellular cooperation, the selective
advantages provided by such structures.
67. Mammalian red blood cells have no nuclei, must
originate in other tissue systems, are relatively long-lived,
are small with shapes that actively respond to their
environment, and are metabolic anaerobes. Other
vertebrates have red blood cells that are usually nucleated
and are often relatively large, aerobic, self-replicating, and
short-lived.
