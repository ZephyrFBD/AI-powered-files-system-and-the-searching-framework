against a black sky. But they
do exert a gravitational force on nearby objects, and also on light rays (or photons)
that pass nearby (just like in Fig. 33–15). The black hole believed to be at the
center of our Galaxy (
) was discovered by examining the
motion of matter in its vicinity. Another technique is to examine stars which
appear to move as if they were one member of a binary system (two stars rotating
about their common center of mass), but without a visible companion. If the
unseen star is a black hole, it might be expected to pull off gaseous material from
its visible companion (as in Fig. 33–10). As this matter approached the black
hole, it would be highly accelerated and should emit X-rays of a characteristic
type before plunging inside the event horizon. Such X-rays, plus a sufficiently
high mass estimate from the rotational motion, can provide evidence for a black
hole. One of the many candidates for a black hole is in the binary-star system
Cygnus X-1. It is widely belie
