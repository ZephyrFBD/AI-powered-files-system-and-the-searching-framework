Figure 12.5 A test cross can be performed to determine whether an organism expressing a dominant trait is a
homozygote or a heterozygote.
In pea plants, round peas (R) are dominant to wrinkled peas (r).You do a test cross between a pea plant with wrinkled
peas (genotype rr) and a plant of unknown genotype that has round peas. You end up with three plants, all which have
round peas. From this data, can you tell if the round pea parent plant is homozygous dominant or heterozygous? If
the round pea parent plant is heterozygous, what is the probability that a random sample of 3 progeny peas will all be
round?
a.
The data set is too small to predict the genotype of the round pea plant. Assuming that the unknown parent
is heterozygous, the probability of having only round pea plants from a random sample of 3 progeny will be

The genotype of the unknown round pea
