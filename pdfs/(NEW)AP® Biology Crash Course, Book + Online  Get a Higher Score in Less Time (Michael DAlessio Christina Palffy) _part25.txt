ehydration
synthesis
Contain a central carbon atom covalently bonded to four atoms or functional groups:
— One of the four is always a hydrogen atom
— A carboxyl functional group (acidic) –COOH and an amine functional group (basic) –NH2
— Fourth component is a variable R group, which is different for each amino acid
iii. Proteins have four levels of physical structure:
Primary structure—refers to the specific linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide.
Secondary structure—the initial folding patterns of certain lengths of the polypeptide chain,
such as alpha helices and beta pleated sheets.
Tertiary structure—refers to the overall shape in which a polypeptide eventually folds.
Quaternary structure—arises from the association of two or more folded polypeptides to
form a multi-subunit protein.
4. Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA)—made from monomers called nucleotides.
i.
A nucleotide has three parts:
A 5-carbon sugar—either deoxyribose (in DNA) or ribose (in RNA).
A phosphate group—presen
