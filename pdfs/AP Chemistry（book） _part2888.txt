Nitrogen Oxides and Photochemical Smog
Nitrogen oxides are primary components of smog, a phenomenon with which 
city dwellers are all too familiar. The term smog refers to the pollution condition 
that occurs in certain urban environments when weather conditions produce 
a relatively stagnant air mass. The smog made famous by Los Angeles, but now 
common in many other urban areas as well, is more accurately described as pho-
tochemical smog because photochemical processes play a major role in its for-
mation (Figure 18.11).
The majority of nitrogen oxide emissions (about 50%) comes from cars, buses, 
and other forms of transportation. Nitric oxide, NO, forms in small quantities in the cyl-
inders of internal combustion engines in the reaction
