LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-1.I
Explain the inheritance of 
genes and traits as described 
by Mendel’s laws.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.I.2
Fertilization involves the fusion of two haploid 
gametes, restoring the diploid number of 
chromosomes and increasing genetic variation 
in populations by creating new combinations of 
alleles in the zygote—
a.	Rules of probability can be applied to 
analyze passage of single-gene traits from 
parent to offspring.
b.	The pattern of inheritance (monohybrid, 
dihybrid, sex-linked, and genetically linked 
genes) can often be predicted from data, 
including pedigree, that give the parent 
genotype/phenotype and the offspring 
genotypes/phenotypes.
RELEVANT EQUATION
Laws of Probability—
If A and B are mutually exclusive, then:
P ( A or B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B )
If A and B are independent, then:
P ( A and B ) = P ( A ) × P ( B )
