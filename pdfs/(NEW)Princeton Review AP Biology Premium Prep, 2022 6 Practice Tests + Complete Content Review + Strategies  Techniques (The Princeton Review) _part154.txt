structures of specific nucleotides, amino acids, proteins, lipids, or
carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates
Organic compounds that contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are called carbohydrates. They usually contain
these three elements in a ratio of approximately 1:2:1, respectively. We can represent the proportion of elements
within carbohydrate molecules by the formula CnH2nOn, which can be simplified as (CH2O)n.
Most carbohydrates are categorized as either monosaccharides, disaccharides, or polysaccharides. The term
saccharides is a fancy word for “sugar.” The prefixes mono-, di-, and poly- refer to the number of sugars in the
molecule. Mono- means “one,” di- means “two,” and poly- means “many.” A monosaccharide is therefore a
carbohydrate made up of a single saccharide.
Monosaccharides: The Simplest Sugars
Monosaccharides, the simplest sugars, serve as an energy source for cells. The two most common sugars are (1)
glucose and (2) fructose. Galactose, ribose, and deoxyri
