The Laws of Thermodynamics
9. Which of the following possibilities could increase the effi-
ciency of a heat engine or an internal combustion engine?
(a) Increase the temperature of the hot part of the system
and reduce the temperature of the exhaust.
(b) Increase the temperatures of both the hot part and the
exhaust part of the system by the same amount.
(c) Decrease the temperatures of both the hot part and
the exhaust part of the system by the same amount.
(d) Decrease the temperature of the hot part and increase
the temperature of the exhaust part by the same
amount.
(e) None of the above; only redesigning the engine or
