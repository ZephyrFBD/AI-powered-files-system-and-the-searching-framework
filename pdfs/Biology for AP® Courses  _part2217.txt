43. Bioluminescence is an example of convergent
evolution; 30 distinct lineages have acquired this
characteristic, and all involve some form of a class of
molecules called luciferins. Sexual selection pressures are
strong for light-emitting organisms. Ellis and Oakley
(Curr Biol, 2016) examined the number of species that
lack luminosity in groups of closest evolutionary relation
(sister linear) with those species that are luminous.
Similarly, scientists made the same comparison between
groups that use luminosity for concealment (counter-
illumination) and their sister lineages. The graphs
summarize their results, comparing the natural logarithm
of the number of species in each lineage.

Based on the data shown in the graphs, describe a model
that can account for the increased speciation of
bioluminescent lineages, including the mechanism of
speciation.
