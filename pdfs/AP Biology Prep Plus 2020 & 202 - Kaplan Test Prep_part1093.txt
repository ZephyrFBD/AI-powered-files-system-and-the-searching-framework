A researcher has discovered two new proteins in the bacterium Escherichia coli (E.
coli): protein X and protein Y. Protein X, whose structural gene is located in the X
operon, is found to bind to its own promoter. Protein Y, whose structural gene is
located in the Y operon, has an unknown function. To determine the function of
10% of that energy, and only a tenth of the energy primary consumers
received is available for secondary consumers like collared lizards and
grasshopper mice. The red-tailed hawk and elf owl, which are tertiary
consumers, receive 0.1% of the energy that was produced by the original
primary producers.
Which of the following most completely accounts for the loss of energy at
higher trophic levels?
Energy gets trapped in unusable forms like bone, is consumed by
autotrophs,
