 If the inheritance of two traits fully obeys Mendelian
laws of inheritance, where may you assume that the genes
are located?
a.
on any autosomal chromosome or chromosomes
b.
on Y chromosomes
c.
on the same chromosome
d.
on separate chromosomes
13. How many different offspring genotypes are expected
in a trihybrid cross between parents heterozygous for all
three traits? How many phenotypes are expected if the
traits behave in a dominant and recessive pattern?
a.
64 genotypes; 16 phenotypes
b.
16 genotypes; 64 phenotypes
c.
8 genotypes; 27 phenotypes
d.
27 genotypes; 8 phenotypes
14. Four-oâ€™ clock flowers may be red, pink or white. In the
crossing of a true-breeding red and true-breeding white
plants, all the offspring are pink. Use a Punnett square to
determine the correct genotype of the offspring if the red
parent has genotype RR and the white parent has genotype
rr.
a.
RR and Rr
b.
Rr and rr
c.
Rr only
d.
RR only
