000 genes in the tissue samples.
They found that for each participant the exercised leg had reduced inflammation and improved metabolism compared
with the non-exercised leg. These differences were accompanied by changes in genes associated with metabolism and
inflammation. However, the actual nucleotide sequences of the genes weren’t changed. Instead, some genes were
methylated, which simply means methyl groups were attached to certain nucleotides along the sequence. This, essentially,
turned the genes “off” or otherwise changed how they were expressed. DNA methylation is an example of epigenetics,
which is a process that alters genes without affecting the nucleotide sequence of the genes. The full research article can be
