 transition from pure 
covalent bonding in elemental semiconductors to polar covalent bonding in compound 
semiconductors. As the difference in electronegativity of the elements increases, the 
bonding becomes more polar and the band gap increases.

Electrical engineers manipulate both the orbital overlap and the bond polarity to 
control the band gaps of compound semiconductors for use in a wide range of electrical 
and optical devices. The band gaps of several elemental and compound semiconductors 
are given in Table 12.4.
