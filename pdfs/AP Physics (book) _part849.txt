If there had been little or no static friction between the rolling objects and the
plane in these Examples, the round objects would have slid rather than rolled, or a
combination of both. Static friction must be present to make a round object roll.
We did not need to take friction into account in the energy equation for the rolling
objects because it is static friction and does no work—the point of contact of a
sphere at each instant does not slide, but moves perpendicular to the plane (first
down and then up as shown in Fig. 8–25) as it rolls. Thus, no work is done by the
static friction force because the force and the motion (displacement) are perpen-
dicular. The reason the rolling objects in Examples 8–12 and 8–13 move down the
slope more slowly than if they were sliding is not because friction slows them
down. Rather, it is because some of the gravitional potential energy is converted
to rotational kinetic energy, leaving less for
