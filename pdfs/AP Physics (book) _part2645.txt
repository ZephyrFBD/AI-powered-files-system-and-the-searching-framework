The distance between the first two fringes (say) can be
found using right triangles as shown in Fig. 24–10.
SOLUTION Given
and
the first-order fringe 
occurs at an angle given by
This is a very small angle, so we can take
with in radians. The first-
order fringe will occur a distance 
above the center of the screen (see
Fig. 24–10), given by
so
The second-order fringe 
will occur at
above the center, and so on. Thus the lower-order fringes are 6.00 mm apart.
NOTE The spacing between fringes is essentially uniform until the approxima-
tion
is no longer valid.
