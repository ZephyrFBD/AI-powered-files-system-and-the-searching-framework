An object attached to a coil spring can exhibit oscillatory motion. Many kinds of oscillatory 
motion are sinusoidal in time, or nearly so, and are referred to as simple harmonic motion. Real
systems generally have at least some friction, causing the motion to be damped. The automobile 
spring shown here has a 
shock absorber (yellow) that 
purposefully dampens the 
oscillation to make for a 
smooth ride. When an 
external sinusoidal force is 
exerted on a system able to 
oscillate, resonance occurs if 
the driving force is at or near 
the natural frequency of 
oscillation.
Vibrations can give rise to 
waves—such as water waves 
or waves traveling along a 
cord—which travel outward 
from their source.
