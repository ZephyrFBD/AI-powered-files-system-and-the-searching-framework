t is the
traveling wavelength of the sound in air at 20°C?
*95. The intensity at the threshold of hearing for the human ear
at a frequency of about 1000 Hz is
for which 
the sound level, is 0 dB. The threshold of pain
at the same frequency is about 120 dB, or
corresponding to an increase of intensity by a factor of 
By what factor does the displacement amplitude, A, vary?

blood-flow speeds. Suppose the device emits sound at
3.5 MHz, and the speed of sound in human tissue is about

1. At a painfully loud concert, a 120-dB sound wave travels
away from a loudspeaker at 
How much sound wave
energy is contained in each 
volume of air in the
region near this loudspeaker? (See Sections 12–2 and 11–9.)
