fference in the
concentrations of ions, though, results in stresses that the
cell must expend energy to relieve. Based on this
constraint on the total number of ions, connect this refined
model based on ratios of ion concentration rather than
absolute ionic concentrations to the modern concept of
shared ancestry.
Frequently, a follow-up question regarding scientific data
on the AP Biology Exam will ask you to pose questions
that are raised by the data. Credit will be awarded for
scientific questions. These questions usually look for a
cause-and-effect relationship, and are testable.
C. Examine relative concentrations of potassium and
magnesium ions in terrestrial and marine organisms. Pose
a question that could be investigated to connect
concentrations of these ions to adaptations to a change in
the environment.
Macallum noted the high potassium to sodium ratio
relative to seawater, and made this claim about what the
ratio implied about the oceans of early Earth:
â€œAt once it is suggest
