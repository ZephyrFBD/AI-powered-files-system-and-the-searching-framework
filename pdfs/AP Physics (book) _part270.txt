vertical (y) motions
separately. If you are given the initial velocity, you
may want to resolve it into its x and y components.
6. List the known and unknown quantities, choosing
and  
or
where  
and using the 
or 
sign, depending on whether
you choose y positive up or down. Remember that
never changes throughout the trajectory, and that
at the highest point of any trajectory that
returns downward. The velocity just before landing is
generally not zero.
7. Think for a minute before jumping into the equations.
A little planning goes a long way. Apply the relevant
equations (Table 3–2), combining equations if neces-
sary. You may need to combine components of a
vector to get magnitude and direction (Eqs.3–4).

Projectile Motion
Our approach to solving Problems in Section 2–6 also
applies here. Solving Problems involving projectile
motion can require creativity, and cannot be done just
by following some rules. Cert
