whose composition is AlSi3O10. (b) Using Figure 22.32, 
propose a reasonable description of the structure of this

high-temperature reduction of GeO2 with carbon. The Ge is 
converted to GeCl4 by treatment with Cl2 and then puriﬁed 
by distillation; GeCl4 is then hydrolyzed in water to GeO2 
and reduced to the elemental form with H2. The element 
is then zone reﬁned. Write a balanced chemical equation 
for each of the chemical transformations in the course of 
forming ultrapure Ge from GeO2.

in SiO2, a mineral class called feldspars result. The feldspars
