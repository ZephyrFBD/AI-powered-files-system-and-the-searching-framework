istillation is a way of purifying liquids and is the procedure by 
which petrochemical plants achieve the separation of crude petro-
leum into gasoline, diesel fuel, lubricating oil, and other products 
 
(Figure 13.19). Distillation is also used routinely on a small scale in 
the laboratory.

Recall from Section 11.5 that the normal boiling point of a liquid is the temperature 
at which its vapor pressure equals 1 atm. Because the solution has a lower vapor pres-
sure than the pure solvent, a higher temperature is required for the solution to achieve a 
vapor pressure of 1 atm. As a result, the boiling point of the solution is higher than that of the 
pure solvent. This effect is seen in Figure 13.20.
The increase in the boiling point of a solution, relative t
