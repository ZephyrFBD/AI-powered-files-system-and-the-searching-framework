en consumption (i.e., cellular respiration) for these seeds and 
explain your reasons. 
4. Imagine that you are asked to measure the rate of respiration for a 25 g reptile and 
a 25 g mammal at 10°C. Predict how the results would compare, and justify your 
prediction. 
5. Imagine that you are asked to repeat the reptile/mammal comparison of oxygen 
consumption, but at a temperature of 22°C. Predict how these results would differ 
from the measurements made at 10°C, and explain your prediction in terms of the 
metabolism of the animals. 
6. What difficulties would there be if you used a living green plant in this investigation 
instead of germinating seeds?

■ Procedures 
The rate of cellular respiration can be measured by several methods, and two reliable 
methods are detailed below. Your teacher will tell you which method you will use to 
measure the rate of respiration in germinating plant seeds at room temperature.
