lifting a 1080-kg frame at a construction site, Fig. 4–68.
(a) What is the lift force
exerted by the air on 
the helicopter rotors?
(b) What is the tension
in the cable (ignore its
mass) which connects the

80. An elevator in a tall building is allowed to reach a maxi-
mum speed of 
going down. What must the tension
be in the cable to stop this elevator over a distance of 
2.6 m if the elevator has a mass of 1450 kg including
occupants?
81. A fisherman in a boat is using a “10-lb test” fishing line.
This means that the line can exert a force of 45 N without

(a) How heavy a fish can the
fisherman land if he pulls the fish up vertically at constant
speed? (b) If he accelerates the fish upward at 
what maximum weight fish can he la
