X is a transcription factor. 
(D) Protein X is a hormone. 
11. The hormone prolactin has varying effects in 
many different animal species. All vertebrates 
produce prolactin, which is involved in signal 
transduction pathways. In mammals, prolactin 
stimulates the production of milk in mammary 
glands. In fish, prolactin plays an important role 
in osmoregulation. In birds, prolactin is 
involved in lipid metabolism. 
Which of the following best explains the 
presence of prolactin in various vertebrate 
species? 
(A) Though all vertebrates produce prolactin, 
its varied uses indicate it arose as a result 
of convergent evolution and not as a result 
of common ancestry. 
(B) Prolactin is a homologous hormone 
because it has a common origin but 
different functions in various species. 
(C) Prolactin will bind only to intracellular 
receptors in animal species with 
phospholipid bilayers, so its effects are 
varied in different species. 
(D) Because of different receptors activating 
dif
