h means that the displacement as
a function of time follows a sine curve.

A simple pendulum of length 
approximates SHM if its
amplitude is small and friction can be ignored. For small ampli-
tudes, its period is given by
(11;11a)
where g is the acceleration of gravity.
When friction is present (for all real springs and pendulums),
the motion is said to be damped. The maximum displacement
decreases in time, and the mechanical energy is eventually all
transformed to thermal energy.
If a varying force of frequency f is applied to a system capable
of oscillating, the amplitude of oscillation can be very large if the
frequency of the applied force is near the natural (or resonant)
frequency of the oscillator. This is called resonance.
Vibrating objects act as sources of waves that travel 
outward from the source. Waves on water and on
