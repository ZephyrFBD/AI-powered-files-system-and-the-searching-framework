is, all the forces or components that act radially, toward
or away from the center of the circular path. The sum
of these forces (or components) provides the centrip-
etal acceleration,
3. Choose a convenient coordinate system, preferably
with one axis along the acceleration direction.
4. Apply Newton’s second law to the radial component:

1. Draw a free-body diagram, showing all the forces
acting on each object under consideration. Be sure
you can identify the source of each force (tension 
in a cord, Earth’s gravity, friction, normal force, and
so on). Don’t put in something that doesn’t belong
(like a centrifugal force).
2. Determinewhich of the forces, or which of their compo-
nents, act to provide the centripetal acceleration—that
If the wheels and tires of the car are rolling normally without slipping or 
sliding, the bottom of the tire is at rest against the road at each instan
