their
bodies were favored via natural selection
because they survived the cold better than flies
that did not have these traits.
b.
In cold conditions, flies have less need for
reproduction than in warm conditions and so
energy normally used for reproduction is
diverted to other survival functions.
c.
Flies respond to weather conditions to shift their
energy resources to either storage in their bodies
in the cold or to reproduction when conditions
become warm again.
d.
All fruit flies have the same genetic makeup, but
express different patterns of genes under
different conditions, which results in expression
of certain genes for cold conditions and others
for warm conditions.

Female parasitoid wasps lay their eggs inside the bodies of
caterpillars. The caterpillars die when the eggs hatch, and
the young wasps feed on the body of the caterpillar. Egg-
laying females of two species of parasitoid wasps were
studied in special grow
