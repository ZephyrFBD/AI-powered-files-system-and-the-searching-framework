the atom as well as their distribution around the nucleus and their energies. 
We will see that the quantum description of the electronic structure of atoms 
helps us to understand the arrangement of the elements in the periodic table— 
why, for example, helium and neon are both unreactive gases, whereas so-
dium and potassium are both soft, reactive metals.
6.1 ∣ The Wave Nature of Light
Much of our present understanding of the electronic structure of atoms has come from 
analysis of the light either emitted or absorbed by substances. To understand electronic 
structure, therefore, we must first learn more about light. The light we see with our eyes, 
visible light, is one type of electromagnetic radiation. Because electromagnetic radia-
tion carries energy through space, it is also known as radiant energy.
There are many types of electromagnetic radiation in addition to visible light. These 
different types—radio waves, infrared radiation (heat), X rays—may seem very different
