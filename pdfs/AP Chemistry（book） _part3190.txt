It is not possible to measure the standard reduction potential of a half-reaction directly. 
If we assign a standard reduction potential to a certain reference half-reaction, however, we 
can then determine the standard reduction potentials of other half-reactions relative to 
that reference value. The reference half-reaction is the reduction of H+1aq2 to H21g2 under 
standard conditions, which is assigned a standard reduction potential of exactly 0 V:
 
2 H+1aq, 1 M2 + 2 e- ¡ H21g, 1 atm2 E°
red = 0 V

An electrode designed to produce this half-reaction is called a standard hydrogen 
electrode (SHE). A SHE consists of a platinum wire connected to a piece of platinum 
foil covered with finely divided platinum that serves as an inert surface for the reaction 
(Figure 20.8). Th
