gi are to plants. Sound unbelievable? As the information
about DNA sequences grows, scientists will become closer to mapping the evolutionary history of all life on Earth.

Activity
Using a data set provided by your teacher or other sources, construct a phylogenetic tree or cladogram to
reflect the evolutionary history among a group of organisms based on shared characteristics. Then share
the phylogenetic tree or cladogram with peers for review and revision.
Lab Investigation
APÂ® Biology Investigative Labs: Inquiry-Based Approach, Investigation 3: Comparing DNA Sequences to
Understand Evolutionary Relationships with BLAST. Students will learn to use a common tool, BLAST, to
compare several genes from different organisms and then use this information to construct a cladogram
to determine evolutionary relatedness among species. Then students will use BLAST to track a gene(s)
of choice through several species. Bioinformatics has many app
