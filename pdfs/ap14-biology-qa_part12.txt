 them to identify the appropriate type of data to support those predictions.  
Question 4 
What was the intent of this question? 
Question 4 asks students to analyze data from an investigation of natural selection in a population of 
guppies and connect changes in the phenotype with different selective pressures. The question presented 
a graph of the data, and asked students to describe the change in genetic variation in the population over 
the first 6 months of the experiment. Students were asked to use appropriate evidence from the graph to 
support their description. Students were asked to propose a type of mating behavior that could have 
resulted in the change in phenotype experienced by the guppy population in the absence of predators. 
Students were asked to propose an evolutionary mechanism that explains the change in phenotype 
experienced by the guppy population in the presence of predators.
