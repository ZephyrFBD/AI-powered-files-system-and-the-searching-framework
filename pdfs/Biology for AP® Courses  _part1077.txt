stimulated by external signals called growth factors. Uncontrolled
cell growth leads to cancer, and mutations in the genes encoding protein components of signaling pathways are often
found in tumor cells. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is important for removing damaged or unnecessary cells. The
use of cellular signaling to organize the dismantling of a cell ensures that harmful molecules from the cytoplasm are not
released into the spaces between cells, as they are in uncontrolled death, necrosis. Apoptosis also ensures the efficient
recycling of the components of the dead cell. Termination of the cellular signaling cascade is very important so that the
response to a signal is appropriate in both timing and intensity. Degradation of signaling molecules and dephosphorylation
of phosphorylated intermediates of the pathway by phosphatases are two ways to terminate signals within the cell.
