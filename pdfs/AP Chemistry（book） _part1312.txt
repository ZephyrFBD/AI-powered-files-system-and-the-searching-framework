ce electrons 
of an atom can be represented by electron-dot symbols, called 
 
Lewis symbols. The tendencies of atoms to gain, lose, or share 
their valence electrons often follow the octet rule, which says that 
 
the atoms in molecules or ions (usually) have eight valence 
electrons.
IONIC BONDING (SECTION 8.2) Ionic bonding results from the 
transfer of electrons from one atom to another, leading to the forma-
tion of a three-dimensional lattice of charged particles. The stabili-
ties of ionic substances result from the strong electrostatic attractions 
between an ion and the surrounding ions of opposite charge. The 
magnitude of these interactions is measured by the lattice energy, 
which is the energy needed to separate an ionic lattice into gaseous 
ions. Lattice energy increases with increasing charge on the ions and 
with decreasing distance between the ions. The Born–Haber cycle is a 
useful thermochemical cycle in which we use Hess’s law to calculate 
the lattice energy as th
