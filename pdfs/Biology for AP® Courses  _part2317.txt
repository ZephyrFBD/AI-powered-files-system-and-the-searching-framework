that the time scale for this graph is
much longer than that of the previous graph.

B. Analyze this graph by:
•
identifying times of mass extinctions
•
posing a question regarding any difference between
the graph of extinctions of marine life and the graph
of family-level diversity
•
explaining the slope of the graph of family diversity
following a mass extinction event
50.

Lactate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in glycolysis,
from several species are compared using a Southern blot
technique in the figure on the left: (A) yeast; (B) snail; (C)
mouse; (D) rat; and (E) human (after K. Webster, Journal
of Experimental Biology 2003).
A. Justify the claim that these data provide evidence that
supports glycolysis as a conserved core property.

There are three forms of lactate dehydrogenase whose
roles vary within an organism: LDH-A, -
