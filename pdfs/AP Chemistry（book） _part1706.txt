and iodine are all diatomic  
molecules as a result of covalent bonding. However, due to differences in the strength of the  
intermolecular forces, they exist in three different states at room temperature and standard  
pressure: Cl2 is a gas, Br2 is a liquid, and I2 is a solid.

then to virtually lock them in place, forming a solid. Increasing the pressure on a gas can 
also drive transformations from gas to liquid to solid because the increased pressure brings 
the molecules closer together, thus making intermolecular forces more effective. For exam-
ple, propane 1C3H82 is a gas at room temperature and 1 atm pressure, whereas liquefied pro-
pane (LP) is a liquid at room temperature because it is stored under much higher pressure.
11.2 ∣ Intermolecular Forces
The strengths of intermolecular forces vary over a wide range but are generally much 
weaker than intramolecular forces—ionic, metallic, or covalent bonds (Figure 11.3). Less
