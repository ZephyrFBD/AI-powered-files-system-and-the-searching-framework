ain, particularly if it was bending down to drink. These checks and balances include valves
and feedback mechanisms that reduce the rate of cardiac output. Long-necked dinosaurs such as the
sauropods had to pump blood even higher, up to ten meters above the heart. This would have required
a blood pressure of more than 600 mm Hg, which could only have been achieved by an enormous heart.
Evidence for such an enormous heart does not exist and mechanisms to reduce the blood pressure required
include the slowing of metabolism as these animals grew larger. It is likely that they did not routinely feed
on tree tops but grazed on the ground.
Living in cold water, whales need to maintain the temperature in their blood. This is achieved by the
veins and arteries being close together so that heat exchange can occur. This mechanism is called a
countercurrent heat exchanger. The blood vessels and the whole body are also protected by thick layers
of blubber to prevent heat loss. In land animals that
