 source of food for humans and animals. The starch that is consumed by humans is
broken down by enzymes, such as salivary amylases, into smaller molecules, such as maltose and glucose. The cells can
then absorb the glucose.
Starch is made up of glucose monomers that are joined by α 1-4 or α 1-6 glycosidic bonds. The numbers 1-4 and 1-6
refer to the carbon number of the two residues that have joined to form the bond. As illustrated in Figure 3.10, amylose
is starch formed by unbranched chains of glucose monomers (only α 1-4 linkages), whereas amylopectin is a branched
polysaccharide (α 1-6 linkages at the branch points).

Figure 3.10 Amylose and amylopectin are two different forms of starch. Amylose is composed of unbranched chains
of glucose monomers connected by α 1,4 glycosidic linkages. Amylopectin is composed of branched chains of glucose
monomers connected by α 1
