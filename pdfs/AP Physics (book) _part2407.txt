direction of the induced current, (b) the magnitude
of the average induced emf, and (c) the average induced
current if the coil resistance is 
?
11. (II) What is the direction of the induced current in the circu-
lar loop due to the current shown in each part of Fig. 21–61?
Explain why.

12. (II) A 600-turn solenoid, 25 cm long, has a diameter of
2.5 cm. A 14-turn coil is wound tightly around the center of
the solenoid. If the current in the solenoid increases uni-
formly from 0 to 5.0 A in 0.60 s, what will be the induced emf
in the short coil during this time?
13. (II) When a car drives through the Earth’s magnetic field,
an emf is induced in its vertical 55-cm-long radio antenna.
If the Earth’s field 
points north with a dip
angle of 38°, what is the maximum emf induced in the
antenna and which direction(s) will the car be moving to
produce this maximum value? The car’s speed is 
on
a horizontal road.
