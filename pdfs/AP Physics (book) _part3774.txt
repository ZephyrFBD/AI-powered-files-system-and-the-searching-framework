nearer galaxies are moving away from us relatively faster than those very distant
ones, meaning the expansion of the universe in more recent epochs has sped up.

This acceleration in the expansion of the universe (in place of the expected
deceleration due to gravitational attraction between masses) seems to have begun
roughly 7 billion years ago (7 Gyr, which would be about halfway back to what
we call the Big Bang).
What could be causing the universe to accelerate in its expansion, against the
attractive force o
