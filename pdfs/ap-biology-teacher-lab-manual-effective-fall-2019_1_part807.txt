is sufficient to compare 
relative amounts of oxygen produced. Alternatively, the color change can be recorded as 
a change in absorbency using a variety of available meters, such as a spectrophotometer 
or a probe system. (Information about the use of spectrophotometers and/or probe 
systems is found in the Additional Information section of this investigation.)

Materials 
• Turnip peroxidase 
•  0.1% hydrogen peroxide 
• Guaiacol
• Distilled (deionized) water 
• 2 test tubes (approximately 16 x 150 
mm) and appropriate test tube rack  
•  Timer

This investigation is designed to be performed without a spectrophotometer, but your 
teacher may ask you to use a spectrophotometer or probe system. If so, additional 
equipment may be required.
