ould a neutral K atom or a K+ ion have a more negative 
value of electron affinity?
 7.52  What is the relationship between the ionization energy of an

the neutral atom, F?
 
7.53  Consider the first ionization energy of neon and the electron 
affinity of fluorine. (a) Write equations, including electron 
configurations, for each process. (b) These two quantities have 
opposite signs. Which will be positive, and which will be nega-
tive? (c) Would you expect the magnitudes of these two quanti-
ties to be equal? If not, which one would you expect to be larger?

Which of the following statements are true? (i) The energy 
change for this process is the electron affinity of the Ca+ 
ion. (ii) The energy change for this process is the negative of
