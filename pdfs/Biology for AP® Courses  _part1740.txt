when and how its genes are expressed. For this to occur, there must be a mechanism to control when a gene is expressed to
make RNA and protein, how much of the protein is made, and when it is time to stop making that protein because it is no
longer needed.
Although genetic differences between species and between individuals within a species are often responsible for phenotypic
differences, another mechanism that can create phenotypic differences is differences in gene expression. For example,
although every cell in an organism contains the same genes, the bone cells in the organism appears different from the
fat cells due to differences in which genes are expressed by which cell. Similarly, although mice and humans share
approximately 97.5% of their genes, they are very different organisms because different genes are turned on at different
times during development and in different cells. Even organisms that share 100%
