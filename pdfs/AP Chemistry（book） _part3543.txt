Na2SO3 or NaHSO3 are used as food additives to prevent bacterial 
spoilage. However, they are known to increase asthma symptoms in approximately 5% of 
asthmatics. Thus, all food products with sulfites must now carry a warning label disclos-
ing their presence (Figure 22.17).
Although combustion of sulfur in air produces mainly SO2, small amounts of SO3 
are also formed. The reaction produces chiefly SO2 because the activation-energy bar-
rier for oxidation to SO3 is very high unless the reaction is catalyzed. Interestingly, the 
SO3 by-product is used industrially to make H2SO4, which is the ultimate product of the 
reaction between SO3 and water. In the manufacture of sulfuric acid, SO2 is obtained by 
burning sulfur and then is oxidized to SO3, using a catalyst such as V2O5 or platinum. 
The SO3 is dissolved in H2SO4 because it does not dissolve quickly in water, and then the 
H2S2O7 formed in this reaction, called pyrosulfuric acid, is added to water to form H2SO4:
