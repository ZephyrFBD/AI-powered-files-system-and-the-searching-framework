mp is used to maintain the inside tempera-
ture of a house at

is 
Assume that when it is operating, the heat pump does
work at a rate of 1500 W. Also assume that the house loses
heat via conduction through its walls and other surfaces at
a rate given by 
(a) For what outside
temperature would the heat pump have to operate all the time
in order to maintain the house at an inside temperature of
22°C? (b) If the outside temperature is 8°C, what percentage
of the time does the heat pump have to operate in order to
maintain the house at an inside temperature of 22°C?
