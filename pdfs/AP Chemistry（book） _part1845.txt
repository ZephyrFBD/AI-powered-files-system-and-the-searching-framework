terials
the rhombic lattice is commonly referred to as a centered rectangular lattice. The lattices 
in Figure 12.4 represent five basic shapes: squares, rectangles, hexagons, rhombuses (dia-
monds), and arbitrary parallelograms. Other polygons, such as pentagons, cannot cover 
space without leaving gaps, as Figure 12.5 shows.
To understand real crystals, we must consider three dimensions. A three-dimensional 
lattice is defined by three lattice vectors a, b, and c (Figure 12.6). These lattice vectors define a 
unit cell that is a parallelepiped (a six-sided figure whose faces are all parallelograms) and is 
described by the lengths a, b, c of the cell edges and the angles a, b, g between these edges. 
There are seven possible shapes for a three-dimensional unit cell, as shown in Figure 12.6.
