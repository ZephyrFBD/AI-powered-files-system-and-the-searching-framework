Objective
2.7 The student will be able to explain how cell sizes and shapes affect the overall rate of
nutrient intake and the rate of waste elimination.
Cells fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Only the predominantly single-celled organisms
of the domains Bacteria and Archaea are classified as prokaryotes (pro- = “before”; -kary- = “nucleus”). Cells of animals,
plants, fungi, and protists are all eukaryotes (eu- = “true”) and have a nucleus.
Components of Prokaryotic Cells
All cells share four common components: 1) a plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the cell’s interior from its
surrounding environment; 2) cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like cytosol within the cell in which other cellular components
are found; 3) DNA, the genetic material of the cell; and 4) ribosomes, which synthesize proteins. However, prokaryotes
differ from eukaryotic cells in several ways.
A prokaryote is a simp
