ers, including those based
on non-coding DNA, are now used to compare the genomes of individuals in a population. Although individuals of a given
species are genetically similar, they are not identical; every individual has a unique set of traits. These minor differences in
the genome between individuals in a population are useful for the purposes of genetic mapping. In general, a good genetic
marker is a region on the chromosome that shows variability or polymorphism (multiple forms) in the population.
Some genetic markers used in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), variable
number of tandem repeats (VNTRs), microsatellite polymorphisms, and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
RFLPs (sometimes pronounced “rif-lips”) are detected when the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease
that recognizes specific sequences in the DNA to generate a series of DNA fragments, which are then analyzed by gel
electrophoresis. The DNA
