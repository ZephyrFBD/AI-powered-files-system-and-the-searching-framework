aterial regularly to deepen their understanding 
of the key concepts addressed by the textbook and 
to apply the science practices. While an increasing 
number of textbooks include primary source material, 
it is still important to introduce students to a wide 
variety of materials in order to provide opportunities 
to analyze data from diverse sources. These sources 
should include data tables, charts, graphs, and 
diagrams. You may also use the ancillary materials and 
website resources that accompany recently published 
textbooks to find quality materials to supplement 
classroom instruction.
Textbooks
Any textbook used in the course should be written 
at the college level and encourage a conceptual 
understanding of biology. Ideally, the textbook will 
include multiple examples and approaches to enable 
students to make connections across different domains 
within biology and between biology and other social 
and natural sciences.
