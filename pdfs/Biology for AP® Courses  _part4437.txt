es (Figure 36.33). These species help to further break down the mineral rich lava into soil where other, less hardy
species will grow and eventually replace the pioneer species. In addition, as these early species grow and die, they add to
an ever-growing layer of decomposing organic material and contribute to soil formation. Over time the area will reach an
equilibrium state, with a set of organisms quite different from the pioneer species.

Secondary Succession
A classic example of secondary succession occurs in oak and hickory forests cleared by wildfire (Figure 36.34). Wildfires
will burn most vegetation and kill those animals unable to flee the area. Their nutrients, however, are returned to the ground
in the form of a
