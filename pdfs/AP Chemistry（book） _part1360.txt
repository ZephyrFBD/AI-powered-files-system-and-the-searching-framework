alue, 1.0 mol C6H6(g) or 3.0 
mol C2H2(g)? Are your calculations consistent with benzene being 
especially stable? (b) Repeat part (a), with the appropriate mole-
cules, for toluene (C6H5CH3), a derivative of benzene that has a 
 
—CH3 group in place of one H. (c) Another reaction you can use to 
compare molecules is hydrogenation, the reaction of a carbon–carbon 
double bond with H2 to make a C—C single bond and two C—H sin-
gle bonds. The experimental heat of hydrogenation of benzene to 
make cyclohexane (C6H12, a six-membered ring with 6 C—C single 
bonds and 12 C—H bonds) is 208 kJ/mol. The experimental heat of 
hydrogenation of cyclohexene (C6H10, a six-membered ring with 
one C “ C double bond, 5 C—C single bonds, and 10 C—H bonds) 
to make cyclohexane is 120 kJ/mol. Show how these data can pro-
vide you with an estimate of the resonance stabilization energy of 
benzene. (d) Are the bond lengths or angles in benzene, compared 
to other hydrocarbons, sufficient to decide if benzen
