▲ Figure 17.20 Amphoterism. Some metal oxides and hydroxides, such as Al1OH23, are 
amphoteric, which means they dissolve in both strongly acidic and strongly basic solutions.
*Notice that the term amphoteric is applied to the behavior of insoluble oxides and hydroxides 
that dissolve in acidic or basic solutions. The similar term amphiprotic (Section 16.2) relates more 
generally to any molecule or ion that can either gain or lose a proton.

Access to clean drinking water is something most people in the 
industrialized world take for granted. Unfortunately, there are rare 
instances in which tap water is not safe to drink, as illustrated by the
