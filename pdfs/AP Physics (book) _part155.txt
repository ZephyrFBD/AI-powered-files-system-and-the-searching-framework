equal.
We use the definitions of average velocity and acceleration to derive a set of
valuable equations that relate x,
a, and
when a is constant, allowing us to
determine any one of these variables if we know the others. We can then solve
many interesting Problems.
Notation in physics varies from book to book; and different instructors use
different notation. We are now going to change our notation, to simplify it a bit
for our discussion here of motion at constant acceleration. First we choose the
initial time in any discussion to be zero, and we call it 
That is,
(This is effectively starting a stopwatch at 
) We can then let 
be the
elapsed time. The initial position 
and the initial velocity 
of an object
will now be represented by 
and 
since they represent x and 
at
At
time 
the position and velocity will be called x and 
(rather than 
and 
).
The average velocity during the time interval
will be (Eq. 2–2)
since we chose
The acceleration, assumed constant in time, is
(Eq. 2–4),
