 to the velocity of
the particle and thus can only change the direction but not the magnitude of its
velocity. Also the magnetic force cannot do work on the particle (force and dis-
placement are perpendicular, Eq. 6–1) and so cannot change the kinetic energy
of the particle, Eq. 6–4.

A helical path. What is the path of a charged
particle in a uniform magnetic field if its velocity is not perpendicular to the
magnetic field?
RESPONSE The velocity vector can be broken down into components parallel
and perpendicular to the field. The velocity component parallel to the field lines
experiences no force
so this component remains constant. The velocity
component perpendicular to the field results in circular motion about the field
lines. Putting these two motions together produces a helical (spiral) motion
around the field lines as shown in Fig. 20–19.
