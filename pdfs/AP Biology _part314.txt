sity between the bacteria grown
in heavy nitrogen and those grown in light nitrogen. This demonstrated
that the new bacteria contained DNA consisting of one heavy strand and
one light strand. See Figure 9.1 of semiconservative replication.

STRUCTURE OF NUCLEIC ACIDS
Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)
The DNA molecule is a double helix, shaped like a twisted ladder,
consisting of two strands running in opposite directions (antiparallel); see
Figure 9.2. One strand runs 5′ to 3′ (right side up), the other 3′ to 5′
(upside down). DNA is a polymer consisting of repeating units of
nucleotides. In DNA, these consist of a 5-carbon sugar (deoxyribose), a
phosphate, and a nitrogen base. The carbon atoms in deoxyribose are
numbered 1 to 5. There are four nitrogenous bases in DNA: adenine (A),
thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). Of the four nitrogenous
bases, adenine and guanine are purines, and thymine and cyto
