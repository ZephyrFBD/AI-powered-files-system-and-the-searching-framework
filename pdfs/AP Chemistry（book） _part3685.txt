The en ligand binds slightly more strongly to the Cu2+ ion than two 
NH3 ligands, so the enthalpy change here (-54 kJ) is slightly more 
negative than for 3Cu(H2O)2(NH3)242+(-46 kJ). There is a big differ-
ence in the entropy change, however: ∆S° is -8.4 J>K for the NH3 re-
action but +23 J>K for the en reaction. We can explain the positive 
∆S° value using concepts discussed in Section 19.3. Because a single 
en ligand occupies two coordination sites, two molecules of H2O are 
released when one en ligand bonds. Thus, there are three product 
molecules in the reaction but only two reactant molecules. The great-
er number of product molecules leads to the positive entropy change 
for the equilibrium.
The slightly more negative value of ∆H° for the en reaction 
(-54 kJ versus -46 kJ) coupled with the positive entropy change 
leads to a much more negative value of ∆G° (–61 kJ for en, -43 kJ for
