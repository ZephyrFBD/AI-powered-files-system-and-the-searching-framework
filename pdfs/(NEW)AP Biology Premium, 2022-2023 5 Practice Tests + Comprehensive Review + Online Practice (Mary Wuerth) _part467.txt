founded population A, leading to less genetic diversity in population A than existed in the original population.
Similarly, the founding members of population C only possessed the allele represented by black circles, again
leading to less genetic diversity in population C than existed in the original population; this is also a very different
allele frequency than that seen in population A.
An example of the founder effect can be seen in the Amish population in Pennsylvania. The founding members
of this population came from Europe in the mid-1700s. The approximately 200 founding members of this population
had a higher frequency of the allele that causes a rare form of dwarfism, Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome. This has led
to the frequency of this allele being relatively high in this population.
Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
Some populations have stable allele frequencies and are not evolving. Populations in an unchanging environment
may not experience the select
