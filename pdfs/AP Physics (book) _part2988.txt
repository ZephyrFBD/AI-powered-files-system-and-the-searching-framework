he second aspect of the revolution that shook the world of physics in the
early part of the twentieth century was the quantum theory (the other was
Einstein’s theory of relativity). Unlike the special theory of relativity, the
revolution of quantum theory required almost three decades to unfold, and many
scientists contributed to its development. It began in 1900 with Planck’s quantum
hypothesis, and culminated in the mid-1920s with the theory of quantum
mechanics of Schrödinger and Heisenberg which has been so effective in explain-
ing the structure of matter. The discovery of the electron in the 1890s, with which
we begin this Chapter, might be said to mark the beginning of modern physics,
and is a sort of precursor to the quantum theory.
