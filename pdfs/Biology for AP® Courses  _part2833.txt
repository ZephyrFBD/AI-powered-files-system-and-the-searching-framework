med elements of the tissue is filled with the matrix. The material in the connective tissue gives it a loose
consistency similar to a cotton ball that has been pulled apart. Loose connective tissue is found around every blood vessel
and helps to keep the vessel in place. The tissue is also found around and between most body organs. In summary, areolar
tissue is tough, yet flexible, and comprises membranes.
Figure 24.12 Loose connective tissue is composed of loosely woven collagen and elastic fibers. The fibers and other
components of the connective tissue matrix are secreted by fibroblasts.
Fibrous Connective Tissue
Fibrous connective tissues contain large amounts of collagen fibers and few cells or matrix material. The fibers can be
arranged irregularly or regularly with the strands lined up in parallel. Irregularly arranged fibrous connective tissues are
found in areas of the body where stress occurs from all directions, such as the dermis of the skin. Regular fibrous connective
