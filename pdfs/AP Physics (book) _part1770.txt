(16;6)
The fringing of the field near the edges can often be ignored, particularly if the
separation of the plates is small compared to their height and width.â€  We summarize
the properties of field lines as follows:
1. Electric field lines indicate the direction of the electric field; the field points
in the direction tangent to the field line at any point.
2. The lines are drawn so that the magnitude of the electric field, E, is propor-
tional to the number of lines crossing unit area perpendicular to the lines.
The closer together the lines, the stronger the field.
3. Electric field lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges;
and the number starting or ending is proportional to the magnitude of the
charge.
Also note that field lines never cross. Why not? Because it would not make sense
for the electric field to have two directions at the same point.
