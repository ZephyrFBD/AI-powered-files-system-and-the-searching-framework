he transcription elongation phase begins with the release of the σ subunit from the polymerase. The dissociation of σ allows
the core enzyme to proceed along the DNA template, synthesizing mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction at a rate of approximately
40 nucleotides per second. As elongation proceeds, the DNA is continuously unwound ahead of the core enzyme and
rewound behind it (Figure 15.8). The base pairing between DNA and RNA is not stable enough to maintain the stability of
the mRNA synthesis components. Instead, the RNA polymerase acts as a stable linker between the DNA template and the
nascent RNA strands to ensure that elongation is not interrupted prematurely.
Figure 15.8 During elongation, the prokaryotic RNA polymerase tracks along the DNA template, synthesizes mRNA in
the 5' to 3' direction, and unwinds and rewinds the DNA as it is read.
Prokaryotic Termination Signals
Once a gene is transcribed, the prokaryotic polymerase needs to be instructed to dissociate from the DNA templa
