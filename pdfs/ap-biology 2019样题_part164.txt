 and RNA. This unit 
highlights how an individual’s genotype is physically expressed through that individual’s 
phenotype. Understanding protein synthesis (transcription and translation) is vital to 
answering essential questions about gene expression. Regulation of gene expression 
and cell specialization are instrumental in ensuring survival within an individual and across 
populations. Unit 7 moves on to cover natural selection.
