g the cell, water will leave the cell, moving 
from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential. The water loss 
causes the cell to lose turgor. A continued loss of water will cause the cell membrane to 
shrink away from the cell wall, and the cell plasmolyzes. 
Have students read the information about water potential and answer the following 
questions. You likely will have to guide students with insufficient mathematical skills 
through the calculations. 
•  Calculate the solute potential of a 0.1 M NaCl solution at 25°C. If the concentration 
of NaCl inside the plant cell is 0.15 M, which way will the water diffuse if the cell is 
placed into the 0.1 M NaCl solutions? 
•  What must the turgor pressure equal if there is no net diffusion between the solution 
and the cell?
