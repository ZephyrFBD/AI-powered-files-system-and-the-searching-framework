s. Because of
the way the glucose subunits are joined, every glucose monomer is flipped relative to the next one resulting in a linear,
fibrous structure.
As shown in Figure 3.11, every other glucose monomer in cellulose is flipped over, and the monomers are packed tightly
as extended long chains. This gives cellulose its rigidity and high tensile strength—which is so important to plant cells.
While the β 1-4 linkage cannot be broken down by human digestive enzymes, herbivores such as cows, koalas, and buffalos
are able, with the help of the specialized flora in their stomach, to digest plant material that is rich in cellulose and use
it as a food source. In these animals, certain species of bacteria and protists reside in the rumen (part of the digestive
system of herbivores) and secrete the enzyme cellulase. The appendix of grazing animals also contains bacteria that digest
cellulose, giving it an important role in the digestive systems of ruminants. Cellulases can break down cellulo
