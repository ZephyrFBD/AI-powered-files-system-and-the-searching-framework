the target cell. Granzymes are released along with the
perforin in the immunological synapse. A granzyme is a protease that digests cellular proteins and induces the target cell to
undergo programmed cell death, or apoptosis. Phagocytic cells then digest the cell debris left behind. NK cells are constantly
patrolling the body and are an effective mechanism for controlling potential infections and preventing cancer progression.
Complement
An array of approximately 20 types of soluble proteins, called a complement system, functions to destroy extracellular
pathogens. Cells of the liver and macrophages synthesize complement proteins continuously; these proteins are abundant
in the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms. The complement system is so
named because it is complementary to the antibody response of the adaptive immune system. Complement proteins bind
to the surfaces of microorganisms and are particularly attracted to pathogens that are
