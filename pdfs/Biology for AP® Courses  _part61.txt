follow the laws of chemistry and physics. For example, when studying biology, you must remember living organisms obey
the laws of thermodynamics while using free energy and matter from the environment to carry out life processes that are
explored in later chapters, such as metabolism and reproduction.
Two types of logical reasoning are used in science: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning
uses particular results to produce general scientific principles. Deductive reasoning uses logical thinking to predict results
