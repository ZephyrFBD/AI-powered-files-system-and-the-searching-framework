rk together to capture and
identify invading pathogens. Certain immune cells, known as
antigen presenting cells, engulf pathogens and present small
components of their unique proteins, known as antigens, on their
cell surfaces. These antigens are then recognized when helper T
cells and killer T cells contact them directly, triggering the start of
the adaptive immune response. Which of the following cell
junction functions is most similar to the method of
communication used by immune cells?

Saccharomyces cerevisiae, more commonly known as yeast, exist in two
diﬀerent genders that are oȇen referred to as mating types. Unlike
mammals, which are typically divided into either male or female, yeast
are categorized as being either a cells or α (alpha) cells.
Interestingly, if a sample of a cells is placed into a test tube, the cells are
able to divide indefinitely, provided there is an adequate supply of
nutrients and space available. However, if an a cell detects the presence
