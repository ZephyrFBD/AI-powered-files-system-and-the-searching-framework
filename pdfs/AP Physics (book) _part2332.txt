nerator, the situation is the reverse of that for a motor. As we saw, the
mechanical turning of the armature induces an emf in the loops, which is the
output. If the generator rotates but is not connected to an external circuit,
the emf exists at the terminals but there is no current. In this case, it takes little effort
to turn the armature. But if the generator is connected to a device that draws cur-
rent, then a current flows in the coils of the armature. Because this current-carrying
coil is in an external magnetic field, there will be a torque exerted on it (as in
a motor), and this torque opposes the motion (use right-hand-rule-2, page 568,
for the force on a wire in Fig. 21–14 or 21–17). This is called a counter torque.
The greater the electrical load—that is, the more current that is drawn—the
greater will be the counter torque. Hence the external applied torque will have to
be greater to keep the generator turning. This makes sense from the conservation
of energy principle. M
