Measurements
Measurements are continuous, meaning there is an infinite number of potential measurements over a given range.
Size, height, temperature, weight, and response rate are all measurements. There are two types of measurement data:
parametric and nonparametric.
Normal or Parametric Data
Normal, or parametric, data is measurement data that fits a normal curve, or distribution, usually when a large
sample size is used. For example, if you took a large sample of 17-year-olds in America and graphed the frequency
of heights, the results will be normally distributed.
Several descriptive statistics can be used to summarize normal data.
The sample size (n) refers to the number of members of the population that are included in the study. Sample size is
an important consideration when you’re trying to determine how well the data in the study represents a population.
Large sample sizes are always better, but for technical reasons, experiments can’t be in
