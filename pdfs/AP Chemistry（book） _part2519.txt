onjugate acid of a substance is 
the parent substance plus one proton.
Solve
(a) If we remove a proton from HClO4, we obtain ClO4
-, which 
is its conjugate base. The other conjugate bases are HS -, PH3, 
and CO3
2 -.
(b) If we add a proton to CN -, we get HCN, its conjugate acid. The 
other conjugate acids are HSO4
-, H3O+, and H2CO3. Notice 
that the hydrogen carbonate ion 1HCO3
-2 is amphiprotic. It 
can act as either an acid or a base.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Consider the following equilibrium reaction:
HSO4
-1aq2 + OH -1aq2 ∆ SO4
2 -1aq2 + H2O1l2
Which substances are acting as acids in the reaction?
(a) HSO4
- and OH -  
(b) HSO4
- and H2O 
(c) OH - and SO4
2 -
 
(d) SO4
2 - and H2O
 
(e) None of the substances are acting as acids in this reaction.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Write the formula for the conjugate acid of each of the fol-
lowing: HSO3
-, F -, PO4
3 -, CO.
