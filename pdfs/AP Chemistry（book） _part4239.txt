The peak would stay 
in the same position in terms of wavelength, but its absorbance 
would decrease. Figure 23.28 dx2 - y2 and dz2. Figure 23.29 Con-
vert the wavelength of light, 495 nm, into energy in joules using the 
relationship E = hc>l. Figure 23.30 The absorption peak would 
shift to shorter wavelengths absorbing green light and the color 
of the complex ion would become red. An even larger shift would 
move the absorption peak into the blue region of the spectrum and 
the color would become orange. Figure 23.34 Only the dx2 - y2 
orbital points directly at the ligands.
