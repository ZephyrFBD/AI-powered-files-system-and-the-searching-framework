ions of the respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems during exercise. 
(b) Design a controlled experiment to determine the relationship between intensity of exercise and  
heart rate. 
(c) On the axes provided below, indicate results you expect for both the control and the experimental  
groups for the controlled experiment you described in part B. Remember to label the axes. 
 
 
 
 3. The physical form of cells and organisms is often influenced by special structural polymers. Choose one 
polymer from each of the following three pairs of polymers:   
 
Pair 1: tubulin . . myosin 
 
Pair 2: cellulose . . chitin 
 
Pair 3: messenger RNA . . transfer RNA 
 
  For each of the three polymers you have chosen, describe its 
(a) structure, and 
(b) role in a cell or organism. 
 
 4. A triploblastic animal is one in which three germ layers form during embryonic development. Triploblastic 
animals include acoelomate, pseudocoelomate, and coelomate (eucoelomate) organisms. 
(a) Identify the
