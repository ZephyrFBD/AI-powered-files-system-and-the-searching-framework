described:
1. Roots anchor a plant to its substrate, store food, absorb water and minerals, and transport these materials to other
areas of the plant. The water absorbing capacity of roots is increased in two ways:
Root hairs are extensions of epidermal cells into the substrate that greatly increase the absorbing surface area.
Mycorrhizae (singular, mycorrhiza) are fungi that have a mutualistic relationship with plants. Their fungal
filaments absorb water and nutrients, effectively increasing the absorbing surface area. In exchange, plant roots
supply the fungi with sugars. Most plants have associated mycorrhizae.
2. Stems support the above ground parts of a plant and serve to transport water, minerals, and sugars between those
parts and the roots. Many plants have thorns or spines that protect stems from herbivory.
3. Leaves are sites for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs in the palisades mesophyll, tightly packed cells
containing chloroplasts. The cells are usually arranged
