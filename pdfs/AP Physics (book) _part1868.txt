Not long ago, a capacitance greater than a few mF was unusual. Today capacitors
are available that are 1 or 2 F, yet they are just a few cm on a side. Such capacitors are
used as power backups, for example, in computer memory and electronics where
the time and date can be maintained through tiny charge flow. [Capacitors are
superior to rechargable batteries for this purpose be
