The first cells grew in a relatively cold environment, requiring
enzymes that could function at low temperatures.

Early life appeared multiple times, meaning that living
organisms have evolved from several diﬀerent original
ancestors.

3. In order to study possible eﬀects of changing ocean conditions,
researchers caught Atlantic cod larvae and grew them in tanks.
The researchers wanted to examine how well the cod could
survive with carbon dioxide levels greater than those found
naturally (i.e., high levels of “ambient CO2”). Increased CO2 levels
lead to the phenomenon of ocean acidification because carbon
dioxide acts as an acid when dissolved in water. The figure below
shows the survival curves for varying food conditions and carbon
dioxide levels.
