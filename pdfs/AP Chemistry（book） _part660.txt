 4.77 Pure acetic acid, known as glacial acetic acid, is a liquid with a 
density of 1.049 g>mL at 25 째C. Calculate the molarity of a solu-
tion of acetic acid made by dissolving 20.00 mL of glacial acetic 
acid at 25 째C in enough water to make 250.0 mL of solution.
 4.78 Glycerol, C3H8O3, is a substance used extensively in the 
manufacture of cosmetic s, foodstuffs, antifreeze, and plas-
tics. Glycerol is a water-soluble liquid with a density of 
1.2656 g>mL at 15 째C. Calculate the molarity of a solution of 
glycerol made by dissolving 50.000 mL glycerol at 15 째C in 
enough water to make 250.00 mL of solution.
Solution Stoichiometry and Chemical Analysis 
(Section 4.6)
 4.79 You want to analyze a silver nitrate solution. (a) You could 
add HCl(aq) to the solution to precipitate out AgCl(s). What 
volume of a 0.150 M HCl(aq) solution is needed to precipitate 
the silver ions from 15.0 mL of a 0.200 M AgNO3 solution? 
(b) You could add solid KCl to the solution to precipitate out
