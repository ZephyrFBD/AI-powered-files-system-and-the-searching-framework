ime Spent in Cell Cycle Stages
Problem: How long does a cell spend in interphase compared to each stage of mitosis?
Background: A prepared microscope slide of blastula cross-sections will show cells arrested in various stages of the
cell cycle. It is not visually possible to separate the stages of interphase from each other, but the mitotic stages are
readily identifiable. If 100 cells are examined, the number of cells in each identifiable cell cycle stage will give an
estimate of the time it takes for the cell to complete that stage.
Problem Statement: Given the events included in all of interphase and those that take place in each stage of mitosis,
estimate the length of each stage based on a 24-hour cell cycle. Before proceeding, state your hypothesis.
Test your hypothesis: Test your hypothesis by doing the following:
1.
Place a fixed and stained microscope slide of whitefish blastula cross-sections under the scanning objective of a
light microscope.
2.
Locate and focus on one of th
