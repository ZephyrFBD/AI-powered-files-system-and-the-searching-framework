The lactic acid molecule, CH3CH1OH2COOH, gives sour 
milk its unpleasant, sour taste. (a) Draw the Lewis structure 
for the molecule, assuming that carbon always forms four 
bonds in its stable compounds. (b) How many p and how 
many s bonds are in the molecule? (c) Which CO bond is 
shortest in the molecule? (d) What is the hybridization of 
atomic orbitals around the carbon atom associated with 
that short bond? (e) What are the approximate bond an-
gles around each carbon atom in the molecule?

An AB5 molecule adopts the geometry shown here. (a) What 
is the name of this geometry? (b) Do you think there are 
any nonbonding electron pairs on atom A? (c) Suppose the 
B atoms are halogen atoms. Of which group in the periodic 
table is atom A a membe
