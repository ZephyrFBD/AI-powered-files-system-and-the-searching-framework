4. (B) Scent is a chemical signal. Choices (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect because audible, tactile, and visual
signals depend on sound, touch, and sight, respectively.
5. (C) Adjusting metabolism in response to changing environmental conditions is a physiological response to a
stimulus. Choices (A), (B), and (D) are examples of behaviors or behavioral responses.
6. (B) Smaller organisms do have a greater surface area to volume ratio than larger organisms and lose more heat
to their environment per gram of body weight, so smaller organisms need a higher metabolism to help mitigate
the heat loss. Not all small organisms have a shorter life span than larger organisms, so choice (A) is incorrect.
Choice (C) is incorrect because not all small organisms are ectothermic. Also, ectothermic animals cannot
internally control their metabolic rate; ectotherms are dependent upon environmental temperatures to influence
their metabolic rate. Smaller organisms do not necessarily consume less f
