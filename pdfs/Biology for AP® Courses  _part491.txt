organelle in an animal cell that functions as the cellâ€™s digestive component; it breaks down proteins,
polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, and even worn-out organelles
narrowest element of the cytoskeleton system; it provides rigidity and shape to the cell and enables cellular
movements
an instrument that magnifies an object
widest element of the cytoskeleton system; it helps the cell resist compression, provides a track along which
vesicles move through the cell, pulls replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell, and is the structural
element of centrioles, flagella, and cilia
(singular = mitochondrion) cellular organelles responsible for carrying out cellular respiration, resulting in
the production of ATP, t
