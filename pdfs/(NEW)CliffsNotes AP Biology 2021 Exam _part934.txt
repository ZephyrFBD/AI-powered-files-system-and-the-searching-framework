5. Sometime before the sixteenth century, a form of deafness, inherited as a recessive allele, appeared in a town in
southern England. In the middle 1600s, several families from the town migrated to North America and settled on
Martha’s Vineyard, an island off the coast of Massachusetts. During the years from 1700 to 1900, deafness among
the 3,000 descendants of the original families was unusually high (as high as 1 in 25) compared with other
populations in the United States (1 in 5,700). During this same period, the population on Martha’s Vineyard
subsisted without interaction with the mainland. Marriages occurred between individuals of the families that lived
on the island. During the early 1900s, however, some families moved away from the island, while many new
families arrived on the island. By 1950, few individuals with deafness remained.
