(a).
D: (e).
E: The rowboat is shaped to have a lot of empty, air-filled
space, so its “average”density is much lower than that of
water (unless the boat becomes full of water, in which case it
sinks). Steel ships float for the same reason.
F: Increases.
G: (b).

2. (a) Show that the buoyant force 
on a partially submerged
object such as a ship acts at the center of gravity of the fluid
before it is displaced, Fig. 10–61. This point is called the
center of buoyancy. (b) To ensure that a ship is in stable
equilibrium, would it be better if its center of buoyancy was
above, below, or at the same point as its center of gravity?
Explain. (See Section 10–7 and Chapter 9.)

4. (a) When submerged in water, two objects with different
volumes have the same apparent weight. When taken out of
water, compare their weights in air. (b) Which object
