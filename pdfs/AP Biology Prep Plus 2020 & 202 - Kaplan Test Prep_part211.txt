Transposition
Transposition involves the movement of DNA segments within a genome
or between the chromosome and plasmid of a bacterium. Transposable
elements (transposons), sometimes known as jumping genes, can
change their position from one place to another by cutting and inserting
themselves in new spots. In bacteria, transposable elements may carry
antibiotic resistance or virulence. Aȇer transposition, bacteria may then
spread the advantageous new genes to the population via some kind of
horizontal transfer.

Transformation Investigation
This is a diﬀicult investigation to conceptualize. It is also diﬀicult to
perform because it requires a considerable amount of specialized
materials, expensive equipment, and aseptic conditions. Some
companies have even prepared soȇware that replaces the lab with a
virtual experiment.
