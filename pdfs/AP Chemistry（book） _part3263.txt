es of a metal that is more easily oxidized than 
iron, such as magnesium 1E°
red = -2.37 V2, are buried near the 
pipe or storage tank and connected to it by wire (Figure 20.27). 
In moist soil, where corrosion can occur, the sacrificial metal 
serves as the anode, and the pipe or tank experiences cathodic 
protection.
Zinc coating is 
oxidized (anode).
Iron is not oxidized 
(cathode).
