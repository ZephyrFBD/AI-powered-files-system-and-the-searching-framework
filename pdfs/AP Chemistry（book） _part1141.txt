ier alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr, and Ba) are even more reactive toward 
nonmetals than is magnesium.
The heavier alkaline earth ions give off characteristic colors when heated in a hot 
flame. Strontium salts produce the brilliant red color in fireworks, and barium salts pro-
duce the green color.
Like their neighbors sodium and potassium, magnesium and calcium are relatively abun-
dant on Earth and in seawater and are essential for living organisms as cations in ionic com-
pounds. Calcium is particularly important for growth and maintenance of bones and teeth.
Give It Some Thought
Calcium carbonate, CaCO3, is often used as a dietary calcium supplement for bone 
health. Although CaCO31s2 is insoluble in water (Table 4.1), it can be taken orally to 
allow for the delivery of Ca2+1aq2 ions to the musculoskeletal system. Why is this 
the case? [Hint: Recall the reactions of metal carbonates discussed in Section 4.3.]
