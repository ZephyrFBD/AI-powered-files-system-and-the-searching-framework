8. Which of the following statements is not true?
a.
Water is polar.
b.
Water can stabilize the temperature of nearby air.
c.
Water is essential for life.
d.

9. Why do hydrogen and oxygen form polar covalent
bonds within water molecules?
a.
Hydrogen is more electronegative than oxygen,
generating a partial negative charge near the
hydrogen atom.
b.
Hydrogen is more electronegative than oxygen,
generating a partial positive charge near the
hydrogen atom.
c.
Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen,
generating a partial negative charge near the
oxygen atoms.
d.
Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen,
generating a partial positive charge near the
oxygen atoms.
