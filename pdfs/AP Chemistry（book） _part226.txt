wing processes, does the potential en-
ergy of the object(s) increase or decrease? (a) The distance 
between two oppositely charged particles is increased. 
 
(b) Water is pumped from ground level to the reservoir of a 
water tower 30 m above the ground. (c) The bond in a chlorine 
molecule, Cl2, is broken to form two chlorine atoms.
 1.29  What is the kinetic energy and velocity of the aluminum 
sphere in Problem 1.4 at the moment it hits the ground? (As-
sume that energy is conserved during the fall and that 100% 
of the sphere’s initial potential energy is converted to kinetic 
energy by the time impact occurs.)
 1.30  What is the kinetic energy and velocity of the silver sphere 
in Problem 1.4 at the moment it hits the ground? (Assume 
that energy is conserved during the fall and that 100% of the 
sphere’s initial potential energy is converted to kinetic en-
ergy by the time impact occurs.)
