, we can say
that a net force causes acceleration.
What precisely is the relationship between acceleration and force? Everyday
experience can suggest an answer. Consider the force required to push a cart
when friction is small enough to ignore. (If there is friction, consider the net
force, which is the force you exert minus the force of friction.) If you push the 
cart horizontally with a gentle but constant force for a certain period of time,
you will make the cart accelerate from rest up to some speed, say 
If you
push with twice the force, the cart will reach 
in half the time. The accel-
eration will be twice as great. If you triple the force, the acceleration is tripled,
and so on. Thus, the acceleration of an object is directly proportionalâ€  to the net
applied force. But the acceleration depends on the mass of the object as well.
If you push an empty grocery cart with the same force as you push one that 
is filled with groceries, you will find that the full cart accelerates more
