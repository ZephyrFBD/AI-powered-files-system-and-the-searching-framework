 metals and nonmetals.
Go Figure 
Name two ways in which the metals shown here differ in general 
appearance from the nonmetals.
Give It Some Thought

Molecules and Molecular 
Compounds
Even though the atom is the smallest representative sample of an element, only the 
 
noble-gas elements are normally found in nature as isolated atoms. Most matter is com-
posed of molecules or ions. We examine molecules here and ions in Section 2.7.
Molecules and Chemical Formulas
Several elements are found in nature in molecular form—two or more of the same type 
of atom bound together. For example, most of the oxygen in air consists of molecules 
that contain two oxygen atoms. As we saw in Section 1.2, we represent this molecula
