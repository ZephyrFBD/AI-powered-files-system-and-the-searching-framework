equilibrium is not evolving and
allele frequencies will stay the same from generation to generation. The five
The Hardy-Weinberg equation for a population in equilibrium is p + q = 1; changes in the allele
frequencies between generations indicate evolution
conditions required to maintain the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are no mutation,
random mating, no gene flow, large population, and no natural selection. Thus,
changes in allele frequency between generations would indicate evolution of the
population.
(b) Identify the null and alternative hypotheses for the evolution of the

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The null hypothesis is that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; the
alternative hypothesis is that the population is not in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium. A statistically significant deviation from the equilibrium allele
frequencies (p-value < 0.5) indicates evolution. Thus, the null hypothesis is
