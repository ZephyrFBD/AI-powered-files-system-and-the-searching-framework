tively fixed positions
in any direction. But only longitudinal waves can propagate through a fluid,
because any transverse motion would not experience any restoring force since 
a fluid is readily deformable. This fact was used by geophysicists to infer that a
portion of the Earth’s core must be liquid: after an earthquake, longitudinal waves
are detected diametrically across the Earth, but not transverse waves.
Besides these two types of waves that can pass through the body of the Earth
(or other substance), there can also be surface waves that travel along the bound-
ary between two materials. A wave on water is actually a surface wave that moves
on the boundary between water and air. The motion of each particle of water at
the surface is circular or elliptical (Fig. 11–29), so it is a combination of horizontal
and vertical motions. Below the surface, there is also horizontal plus vertical
motion, as shown. At the bottom, the motion is only horizontal. (When a wave
approaches shore,
