d-X is called a
carrier. Although she does not exhibit the trait, she can still pass it on to her children.
Both red/green color blindness and hemophilia are X-linked recessive traits.
Other X-linked traits are dominant, meaning only one copy of the mutant allele
is required for expression of the trait in females.
You can also use the Punnett square to figure out the results of sex-linked traits. Here’s a classic example: a male
who has normal color vision and a woman who is a carrier for color blindness have children. How many of the
children will be color blind?
To figure out the answer, let’s set up a Punnett square.
Notice that we placed a bar above any color blind-X to indicate the presence of a color blindness allele. And now for
the results. The couple could have a son who is color-blind, a son who sees color normally, a daughter who is a
carrier, or a daughter who sees color normally.
You will not need to know other X-linked conditions (like Rett Syndrome or
hemophilia) on test
