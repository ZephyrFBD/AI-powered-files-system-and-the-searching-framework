Summary
Genetics is the study of heredity. The foundation of genetics is that traits are produced by genes, which are
found on chromosomes.
Diploid organisms carry two copies of every gene, one on each of two homologous chromosomes, one that
came from their mother and one that came from their father.
When two alleles are the same, the organism is homozygous for that trait. When the two alleles are different, the
organism is heterozygous for the trait.
Genes are described as the genotype of the organism. The physical expression of the traits, or what you see in
the organism, is the phenotype.
Homozygous individuals have only one allele that will determine the phenotype. However, heterozygous
individuals have two different alleles that could contribute to the phenotype. The allele tha
