w osmolarity)—has lower concentration of
solutes (dissolved substances) than a hypertonic solution (low water potential, high
osmolarity).
If two solutions have equal concentrations of solutes, they are called isotonic and there is no
net movement of water across the plasma membrane. This is called dynamic equilibrium.
In osmosis, the solute molecule is not able to cross the selectively permeable plasma
membrane.
2. Active transport requires the cell to use ATP.
i.
Involves movement against the concentration gradient, which is why active transport requires the
use of ATP.
ii. Specific membrane proteins are used in active transport.
iii. Na+-K+ pump is an example of a protein that uses active transport to move ions through the cell’s
membrane.
3. Exocytosis and endocytosis move large molecules and food particles across the plasma membrane
with the expenditure of ATP; in other words, they utilize active transport.
i.
Exocytosis—fusion of vesicles and molecules with the plasma membrane; s
