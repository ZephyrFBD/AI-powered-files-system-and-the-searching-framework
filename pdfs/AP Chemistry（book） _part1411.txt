atoms. We envision this process as resulting from the mixing of the 2s and all three 2p 
atomic orbitals of carbon to create four equivalent sp3 (pronounced “s-p-three”) hybrid 
orbitals. Each sp3 hybrid orbital has a large lobe that points toward one vertex of a tet-
rahedron (Figure 9.17). These hybrid orbitals can be used to form two-electron bonds by 
overlap with the atomic orbitals of another atom, such as H. Using valence-bond the-
ory, we can describe the bonding in
