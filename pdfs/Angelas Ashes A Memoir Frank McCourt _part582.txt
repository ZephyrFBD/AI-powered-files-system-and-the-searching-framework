see myself in the glass of a shop window all 
 
 black from the coal, and I feel like a man, a man with a shilling in his 
 
 pocket, a man who had a lemonade in a pub with two coal men and a 
 
 lime man. I’m not a child anymore and I could easily leave Leamy’s 
 
 School forever. I could work with Mr. Hannon every day and when his 
 
 legs got too bad I could take over the float and deliver coal to the rich 
 
 people the rest of my life and my mother wouldn’t have to be a beggar 
 
 at the Redemptorist priests’ house. 
 
 People on the streets and lanes give me curious looks.Boys and girls 
 
 laugh and call out, Here’s the chimney sweep.How much do you want 
 
 for cleaning our chimney? Did you fall into a coal hole? Were you 
 
 burned by the darkness? 
 
 They’re ignorant.They don’t know I spent the day delivering hundredweights 
 
 of coal and turf.They don’t know I’m a man. 
 
 Mam is sleeping up in Italy with Alphie and there’s a coat over the 
 
 window to keep the room dark.
