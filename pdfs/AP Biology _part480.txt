ductive isolation is the cause of this evolution because
the males and females of the two populations can no longer
identify each otherâ€™s mating calls.
Adaptive radiation is the cause of this evolution because the
two populations of finches feed in different niches.
Geographic isolation is the cause of this evolution because
something has physically separated the two populations.
Temporal isolation is the cause of this evolution because the
birds in one region begin nesting at a different time than the
birds in the other region.
A population of moths has inhabited a region of central
Massachusetts for hundreds of years. The moths exist in a wide
variety of colors that match the color of tree trunks on which they
settle to hide from predators. A large limestone mining quarry
recently opened in that same region. The limestone dust from the
operation reduces sunlight and pollutes the air with white dust.
The graphs below illustrate four possible changes to the moth
population as a result
