(b) Using Newton’s second law for 
photons (Example 27–4) whose
momentum changes from 
to 0, we obtain
NOTE This is a tiny force, but we can see that a very strong light source could
exert a measurable force, and near the Sun or a star the force due to photons in
electromagnetic radiation could be considerable. See Section 22–6.
Photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, pigments such as 
chlorophyll in plants capture the energy of sunlight to change 
to useful
carbohydrate. About nine photons are needed to transform one molecule of 
to carbohydrate and 
Assuming light of wavelength
(chlorophyll
absorbs most strongly in the range 650 nm to 700 nm), how efficient is the
photosynthetic process? The reverse chemical reaction releases an energy of
of 
so 4.9 eV is needed to transform CO2 to carbohydrate.
APPROACH The efficiency is the minimum energy required (4.9 eV) divided
by the actual energy absorbed, nine times the energy (hf) of one photon.
SOLUTION The energy of nine photons, each of energ
