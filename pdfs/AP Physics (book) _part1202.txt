which we call an “echo.”
A wave pulse traveling along a cord is reflected as shown in Fig. 11–33 (time
increases going downward in both a and b). The reflected pulse returns inverted
as in Fig. 11–33a if the end of the cord is fixed; it returns right side up if the end is
free as in Fig. 11–33b. When the end is fixed to a support, as in Fig. 11–33a, the
pulse reaching that fixed end exerts a force (upward) on the support. The support
exerts an equal but opposite force downward on the cord (Newton’s third law).
This downward force on the cord is what “generates” the inverted reflected pulse.

FIGURE 11–35 Rays, signifying the direction of wave
motion, are always perpendicular to the wave fronts
(wave crests). (a) Circular or spherical waves near the
source. (b) Far from the source, the wave fronts are
nearly straight or flat, and are called plane waves.
