osely, have lower melting temperatures,
and are usually liquid at room temperature (oils).

A saturated fatty acid has a single covalent bond between each pair of carbon atoms, and each carbon has two
hydrogens bonded to it (three hydrogens bonded to the last carbon). You can remember this by thinking that each
carbon is “saturated” with hydrogen.
A monounsaturated fatty acid has one double covalent bond, and each of the two carbons in this bond has only
one hydrogen atom bonded to it.
 A polyunsaturated fatty acid is like a monounsaturated fatty acid except that there are two or more double
covalent bonds. 2. A phospholipid looks just like a triglyceride except that one of the
 
fatty acid chains is replaced by a phosphate group (−PO32−) (fatty acid chains is replaced by a phosphate group
(−PO32−) (

the phosphate group. The two fatty acid “tails” of the phosp
