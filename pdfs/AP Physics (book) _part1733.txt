e two charges remained the
same. If the distance between them was allowed to increase, he found that 
the force decreased with the square of the distance between them. That is, if the
distance was doubled, the force fell to one-fourth of its original value. Thus,
Coulomb concluded, the magnitude of the force F that one small charged object
exerts on a second one is proportional to the product of the magnitude of the
charge on one,
times the magnitude of the charge on the other,
and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance r between them (Fig. 16–14).
As an equation, we can write Coulomb’s law as
[magnitudes] (16;1)
where k is a proportionality constant.‡
