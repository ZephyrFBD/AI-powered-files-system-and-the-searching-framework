he heat capacity of the calorimeter is measured to be 7.794 kJ>°C. Calculate the heat of 
reaction for the combustion of a mole of CH6N2.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given a temperature change and the total heat 
capacity of the calorimeter. We are also given the amount of reac-
tant combusted. Our goal is to calculate the enthalpy change per 
mole for combustion of the reactant.
Plan We will first calculate the heat evolved for the combustion 
of the 4.00-g sample. We will then convert this heat to a molar 
quantity.
Solve
For combustion of the 4.00-g sample of methylhydrazine, the 
temperature change of the calorimeter is:
∆T = 139.50 °C - 25.00 °C2 = 14.50 °C
