3.6. Spindle fibers help separate chromosomes during mitosis and
meiosis and consist of microtubules organized into 9 triplets with
no microtubules in the center. Flagella, when present in
prokaryotes, are not made of microtubules.
Microfilaments are assembled from actin filaments and help
support the shape of the cell. They enable
Animal cells to form a cleavage furrow during cell division
Ameba to move by sending out pseudopods
Skeletal muscles to contract as they slide along myosin
filaments

Centrioles, Centrosomes, and the Microtubule Organizing
Centers
Centrioles, centrosomes, or microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs)
are nonmembranous structures that lie outside the nuclear membranes.
They organize spindle fibers, and give rise to the spindle apparatus
required for cell division (see Figure 3.7). Two centriol
