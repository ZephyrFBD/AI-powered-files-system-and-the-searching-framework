lining. Many peptic ulcers are caused by infection by the bacte-

The problem of excess stomach acid can be addressed by (1) re-
moving the excess acid or (2) decreasing the production of acid. Sub-
stances that remove excess acid are called antacids, whereas those 
that decrease acid production are called acid inhibitors. Figure 4.10 
shows several common over-the-counter antacids, which usually con-
tain hydroxide, carbonate, or bicarbonate ions (Table 4.4). Antiulcer 
drugs, such as Tagamet® and Zantac®, are acid inhibitors. They act on 
acid-producing cells in the lining of the stomach. Formulations that 
control acid in this way are now
