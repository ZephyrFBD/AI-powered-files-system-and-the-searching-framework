Removal of 
intracellular 
domain 
Decreased 
sensitivity/insensitive 
Unable to initiate intracellular signal/cascade 
Substitution 
in ligand-
binding site 
No change (in sensitivity) 
Ligand can still bind to receptor 
Conformation/shape of ligand-binding domain 
does not change 
Ligand can still bind to 
receptor 
A similar amino acid leads to no/limited change 
to the structure of the protein

mechanism would result in the evolution of the two forms into different species. (2 points)
