ns are considered more difficult than other question
types. Here’s where POE comes in handy!
From this very basic review, we know immediately that (A) and (B) are not our answers. Both of these are accurate
statements, so we eliminate them. That leaves us with (C) and (D). If you have no idea what (D) means, focus on
(C). In sexual reproduction, each parent contributes one gamete, or half the genetic complement of the offspring.
This definitely helps vary the genetic makeup of the offspring. Choice (C) is a true statement, so it can be
eliminated. The correct answer is (D).
Don’t sweat it if you don’t recall the biology. We’ll be reviewing it in detail soon enough. For now, remember that
the best way to answer these types of questions is to spot all the right statements and cross them off. You’ll wind up
with the wrong statement, which happens to be the correct answer.
Remember Your Resources!
