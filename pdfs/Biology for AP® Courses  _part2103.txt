The solidification of the molten surface of Earth at the end
of the Hadean eon (4 to 4.6 billion years ago) and the
condensation of liquid oceans provided a medium from
which life emerged. The most ancient fossils are colonial,
photosynthetic cyanobacteria called stromatolites. As
climate change melted the perennial snow covering
Greenland, new geologic evidence of the time of that
origin was obtained (Nutman et al., Nature 2016) with the
discovery of the most ancient stromatolites. These fossils
record communities of photosynthetic bacteria embedded
in Isua sediments 3.7 billion years ago. World
