45. A new species of obligate anaerobe, a bacterium, has
been found that lives in hot, acidic conditions. While other
pathways may also be present, which metabolic pathway is
the most likely to be present in this species?
a.
aerobic respiration
b.
the citric acid cycle
c.
oxidative phosphorylation
d.
glycolysis
46. What evidence provides the strongest support that
glycolysis is an older and more conserved pathway than
the citric acid cycle?

a.
Glycolysis is the primitive pathway as it is found
in all three domains. It also occurs in anaerobic
conditions and in the cytosol.
b.
This pathway occurs in the cytosol, is found in
all animals and plants, and does not require
oxygen.
c.
Glycolysis takes place in anaerobic conditions,
can metabolize cholesterol and fatty acids, and
occurs even in methanogens.
d.
This pathway only occurs in the mitochondria. It
is highly flexible because it is found in almost
all organisms.
