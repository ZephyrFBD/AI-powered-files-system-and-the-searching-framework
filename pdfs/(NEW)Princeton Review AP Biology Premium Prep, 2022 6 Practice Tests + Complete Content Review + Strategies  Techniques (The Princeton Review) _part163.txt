ng either a coil (known as an alpha helix) or zigzagging pattern (known as beta-
pleated sheets). These are examples of proteinsâ€™ secondary structures.
A polypeptide folds and twists because the different R-groups of the amino acids are interacting with each other.
Remember, each R-group is unique and has a particular size, shape, charge, and so on, that allows it to react to
things around it. Depending on which amino acids are in a protein and the order that they are in, the protein can
twist and fold in very different ways. This is why proteins can form so many different shapes.
The secondary structure is formed by amino acids that interact with other amino acids close by in the primary
structure. However, after the secondary structure reshapes the polypeptide, amino acids that were far away in the
primary structure arrangement can now also interact with each other. This is called the tertiary structure. Because
most proteins are found in an aqueous environment, hydrophilic amino aci
