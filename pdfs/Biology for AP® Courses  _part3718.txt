The autonomous beating of cardiac muscle cells is regulated by the heartâ€™s internal pacemaker that uses electrical signals
to time the beating of the heart. The electrical signals and mechanical actions, illustrated in Figure 31.14, are intimately
intertwined. The internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is located near the wall of the right atrium.
Electrical charges spontaneously pulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in unison. The pulse reaches
a second node, called the atrioventricular (AV) node, between the right atrium and right ventricle where it pauses for
approximately 0.1 second before spreading to the walls of the ventricles. From the AV node, the electrical impulse enters
the bundle of His, then to the left and right bundle branches extending through the interventricular septum. Finally, the
Purkinje fibers conduct the impulse from the apex of the h
