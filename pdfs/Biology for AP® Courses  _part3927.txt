Consider the innumerable possible antigens that an individual will be exposed to during a lifetime. The mammalian adaptive
immune system is adept in responding appropriately to each antigen. Mammals have an enormous diversity of T cell
populations, resulting from the diversity of TCRs. Each TCR consists of two polypeptide chains that span the T cell
membrane, as illustrated in Figure 33.12; the chains are linked by a disulfide bridge. Each polypeptide chain is comprised of
a constant domain and a variable domain: a domain, in this sense, is a specific region of a protein that may be re
