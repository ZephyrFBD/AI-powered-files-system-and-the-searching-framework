Meiosis generates the genetic diversity that is the raw material for natural
selection and evolution.
STUDY TIP
In meiosis I, homologous pairs separate.
Meiosis is a form of cell division that produces gametes (ova and
sperm). These gametes have the haploid or monoploid chromosome
number (n), half the genetic material of the parent cell. During meiosis, the
nucleus divides twice. Genetic material is randomly separated and
recombined so that each gamete differs genetically from every other
gamete. Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of two haploid gametes
and restores the diploid chromosome number to its offspring. The two cell
divisions in meiosis are called meiosis I and meiosis II.
Meiosis I, also called the reduction division, is the process by which
homologous chromosomes separate. Each chromosome first pairs up
precisely with its homologue into a synaptonemal complex by a process
called synapsis and forms a structure known as a tetrad or bivalent. Th
