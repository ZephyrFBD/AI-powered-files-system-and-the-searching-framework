s Equilibria
Dissolution and precipitation occur both within us and around us. Tooth enamel dis-
solves in acidic solutions, for example, causing tooth decay, and the precipitation of cer-
tain salts in our kidneys produces kidney stones. The waters of Earth contain salts dissolved 
as water passes over and through the ground. Coral reefs are principally made of CaCO3, 
as we saw in the beginning of this chapter. Precipitation of CaCO3 from groundwater is 
responsible for the formation of stalactites and stalagmites within limestone caves.
In our earlier discussion of precipitation reactions, we considered general rules for pre-
dicting the solubility of common salts in water. 
 (Section 4.2) These rules give us a qual-
itative sense of whether a compound has a low or high solubility in water. By considering 
solubility equilibria, however, we can make quantitative predictions about solubility.
