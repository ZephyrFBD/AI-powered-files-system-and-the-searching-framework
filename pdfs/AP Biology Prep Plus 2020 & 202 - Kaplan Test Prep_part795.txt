Venus flytraps have adapted to detecting small animal movements,
with the innate behavior of snapping shut when an animal is detected,
so prey might be consumed. The plant will thus only respond when the
researcher simulates animal movements by rapidly stimulating the
plant in several locations. (C) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because
snapping shut must be a rapid response in order to capture prey
eﬀectively; the accumulation of compounds would take too much
time, giving prey an opportunity to escape. (B) is incorrect because
increasing the pressure had no eﬀect. (D) is incorrect because the
Venus flytrap is exhibiting an innate behavior; lacking a proper
nervous system, it is too simple of an organism to learn and become
sensitized to specific responses.

beneficial to the vines. Using a fungicide will harm the damaging mold
but also the helpful mycorrhizae. The fe
