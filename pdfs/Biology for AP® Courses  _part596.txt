ough the membrane
(Figure 5.19). Many amino acids, as well as glucose, enter a cell this way. This secondary process is also used to store
high-energy hydrogen ions in the mitochondria of plant and animal cells for the production of ATP. The potential energy
that accumulates in the stored hydrogen ions is translated into kinetic energy as the ions surge through the channel protein
ATP synthase, and that energy is used to convert ADP into ATP.

their concentration gradients, a process called co-transport or secondary active transport. (credit: modification of

Injection of a potassium solution into a personâ€™s blood is lethal. Potassium is used in capital punishment and euthanasia.
Why do you think a potassium solution injection is lethal?
