ort plant with white flowers is the product of the probability of
producing a short plant 
 times the probability of producing a plant with white flowers 
. The result is 
.
This same problem-solving process can be used for other types of crosses as well. Try this example. Imagine that
there’s a cross between a pea plant that is PpTt and a pea plant that is Pptt.
First, find the probabilities of each possible outcome for the plant height trait, as shown in Figure 13.3.
Figure 13.3 Results of a Tt × tt Cross
The probability of producing a tall offspring (Tt) is . The probability of producing a short offspring (tt) is also .
Now, find the probabilities of each possible outcome for the flower color trait, as shown in Figure 13.4.
Figure 13.4 Results of a Pp × Pp Cross
The probability of producing an offspring with purple flowers (PP or Pp) is . The probability of producing an
offspring with white flowers (pp) is .
Now, using the laws of probability, solve for the following outcomes:
