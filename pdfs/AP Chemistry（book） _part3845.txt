-ol. The simple 
alcohols are named by changing the last letter in the name of the corresponding alkane 
to -ol—for example, ethane becomes ethanol. Where necessary, the location of the OH 
group is designated by a numeric prefix that indicates the number of the carbon atom 
bearing the OH group. Figure 24.12 shows several commercial products that consist 
entirely or in large part of an alcohol.
The O ¬H bond is polar, so alcohols are more soluble in polar solvents than are 
hydrocarbons. The ¬OH functional group can also participate in hydrogen bond-
ing. As a result, the boiling points of alcohols are higher than those of their parent 
alkanes.
