ately. A cell does not need the maximum amount of ATP that it can make
all the time: At times, the cell needs to shunt some of the intermediates to pathways for amino acid, protein, glycogen, lipid,
and nucleic acid production. In short, the cell needs to control its metabolism.
Regulatory Mechanisms
A variety of mechanisms is used to control cellular respiration. Some type of control exists at each stage of glucose
metabolism. Access of glucose to the cell can be regulated using the GLUT proteins that transport glucose (Figure 7.19).
Different forms of the GLUT protein control passage of glucose into the cells of specific tissues.
Figure 7.19 GLUT4 is a glucose transporter that is stored in vesicles. A cascade of events that occurs upon insulin
binding to a receptor in the plasma membrane causes GLUT4-containing vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane
so that glucose may be transported into the cell.
Some reactions are controlled by having two different enzymesâ€”one each for the two
