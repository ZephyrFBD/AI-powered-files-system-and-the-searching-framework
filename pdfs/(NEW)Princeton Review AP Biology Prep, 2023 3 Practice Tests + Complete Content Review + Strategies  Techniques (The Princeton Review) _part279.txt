ells are produced, they reenter the initial phase—interphase—and the whole process starts over. The
cell goes back to its original state. Once again, the chromosomes decondense and become invisible, and the genetic
material is called chromatin again.
But How Will I Remember All That?
For mitosis, you may already have your own mnemonic. If not, here’s a table with a mnemonic we created for you.

Interphase
I is for Interlude
Prophase
P is for Prepare
Metaphase
M is for Middle
Anaphase
A is for Apart
Telophase
T is for Two
Purpose of Mitosis
Mitosis achieves two things:
the production of daughter cells that are identical copies of the parent cell
maintaining the proper number of chromosomes from generation to generation
The impetus to divide occurs because an organism needs to grow, a tissue needs repair, or asexual reproduction must
take place. For our purposes, we can say that mitosis occurs in just about every cell except sex cells. When you think
of mitosis, remember: “Like bege
