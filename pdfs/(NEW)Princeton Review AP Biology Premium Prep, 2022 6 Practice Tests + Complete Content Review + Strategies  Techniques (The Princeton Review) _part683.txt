kinase,
which catalyzes a key phosphorylation step in glycolysis.
(B) The anterior pituitary gland in the brain releases adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then
causes the adrenal cortex to release glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids then prevent the pituitary from
releasing more ACTH.
(C) Luteinizing hormone triggers ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum, which is a hormone-
producing structure formed during ovulation. The corpus luteum secretes progesterone, which inhibits
LH. The drop in LH causes the degradation of the corpus luteum.
(D) When a tissue is injured, it releases chemicals that activate platelets. Activated platelets themselves then
release chemicals that activate more platelets. These activated platelets then release chemicals to activate
more platelets.
