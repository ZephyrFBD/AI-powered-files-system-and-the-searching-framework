ard AgNO3 in aqueous solution.
Plan (a) Because of their charge, the Cl- ions can be either in the 
coordination sphere, where they are bonded directly to the metal, 
or outside the coordination sphere, where they are bonded ioni-
cally to the complex. The electrically neutral NH3 ligands must be 
in the coordination sphere, and we will assume that four ligands 
are bonded to the Pd(II) ion. (b) Any chlorides in the coordination 
sphere do not precipitate as AgCl.

(a) By analogy to the ammonia complexes of cobalt(III) shown in 
Figure 23.7, we predict that the three NH3 are ligands attached 
to the Pd(II) ion. The fourth ligand around Pd(II) is one chlo-
ride ion. The second chloride ion is not a ligand; it serves only 
as a counterion (a noncoordinating ion that balances charge) 
in the compound. We conclude that the formula showing the 
structure best is 3Pd(NH3)3Cl4Cl.
(b) Because only the non-ligand Cl- can react, we expect to 
produce 1 mol of AgCl(s) per mole of complex. Th
