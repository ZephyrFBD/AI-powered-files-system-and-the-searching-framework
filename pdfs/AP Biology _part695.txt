environment. They have such a low metabolic rate that the amount of heat
they can generate is too small to have any effect on body temperature. The

must maintain adequate body temperature through behavioral means, like
those previously described. Ectotherms include fish, amphibians, and
reptiles. The term ectotherm is closest in meaning to the common term
cold-blooded, which has no real scientific meaning.
Endotherms
