among the offspring, and more diverse populations withstand
selective pressures more because there are more chances of having an individual with a phenotype that can survive the
selective pressure.
Question 6
a. Identify the positive control in the data table.
The positive control is the one that expects full transcription, so the 3rd sample with the factor present and the
unpackaged DNA is the positive control. The others are all relative to that full amount of transcription.
b. Calculate the percentage decrease in transcription with packaged DNA and no transcription factor.
The decrease would be 93%.
c. Determine which independent variable plays more of a role in regulating transcription.
The packaging status of DNA plays a larger role in regulating transcription. The samples with packaged DNA were
always worse, even if the factor was present.
d. Explain how an epigenetic change can lead to a phenotype different from what is expected from the genotype.
An epigenetic change can essent
