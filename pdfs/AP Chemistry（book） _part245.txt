 1.84  Automobile batteries contain sulfuric acid, which is com-
monly referred to as “battery acid.” Calculate the number of 
grams of sulfuric acid in 1.00 gal of battery acid if the solution 
has a density of 1.28 g/mL and is 38.1% sulfuric acid by mass.
 1.85  A 40-lb container of peat moss measures 14 * 20 * 30 in. A 
40-lb container of topsoil has a volume of 1.9 gal. (a) Calcu-
late the average densities of peat moss and topsoil in units of 
g>cm3. Would it be correct to say that peat moss is “lighter” 
than topsoil? (b) How many bags of peat moss are needed to 
cover an area measuring 15.0 ft * 20.0 ft to a depth of 3.0 in.?
 1.86  A package of aluminum foil contains 50 ft2 of foil, which 
weighs approximately 8.0 oz. Aluminum has a density of 
2.70 g>cm3. What is the approximate thickness of the foil in 
millimeters?
 1.87  The total rate at which power is used by humans world-
wide is approximately 15 TW (terawatts). The solar flux av-
