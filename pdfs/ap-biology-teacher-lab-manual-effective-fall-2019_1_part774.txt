ps, one of numerous sources of this enzyme. (The 
peroxidases are a large family of catalytic enzymes that include “cousins” cytochrome 
c peroxidase and catalase.) Using peroxidase, students will develop essential skills to 
explore their own questions about enzymes, including the following: 
What is the effect of using a variety of temperature ranges on the overall rate of 
reaction? 
How will different pH buffers in the reaction affect the rate of reaction? 
Which has a greater effect on the rate of reaction—changing the concentration of 
enzyme or changing the concentration of substrate?  
What other abiotic or biotic changes could affect an enzyme’s activity?  
After developing specific skills to determine enzymatic activity of peroxidase, students 
will have an opportunity to explore the properties of this enzyme on their own. The 
investigation provides an opportunity for students to apply and review concepts they 
have studied previously, including the levels of protein structu
