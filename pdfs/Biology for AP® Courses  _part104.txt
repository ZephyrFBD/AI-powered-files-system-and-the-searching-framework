tes the three-dimensional structure of the
DNA molecule shown in this figure.
The word helix means spiral. What does this tell you about the structure of DNA, which is a double helix
macromolecule?
a.
The nucleotides of the two strands bond together with spiral bonds.
b.
A double-stranded DNA molecule has two spiral stands bound together.
c.
DNA is a double helix because it has two spiral strands held together like a spiral staircase.
d.
Nucleotides are spiral-shaped molecules that bond together to form DNA.

Some cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes; these are called organelles. Organelles are
small structures that exist within cells. Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts, which carry out
indispensable functions: mitochondria produce energy to power the cell, while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize
the energy in sunlight to make sugars. All living things are made of cells; the cell itself is
