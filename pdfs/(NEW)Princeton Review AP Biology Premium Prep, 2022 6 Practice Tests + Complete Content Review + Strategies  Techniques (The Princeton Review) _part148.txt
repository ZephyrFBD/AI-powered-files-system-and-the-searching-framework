n you heat an iron kettle, it gets hot pretty quickly. Why? Because it
has a low specific heat. It doesn’t take much heat to increase the temperature of the kettle. Water, on the other hand,
has a high heat capacity. You have to add a lot of heat to get an increase in temperature. The boiling point of water
is pretty darn high. Liquid water is essential for cellular structures, and it is important that it doesn’t boil away if
someone goes out on a warm day. Water’s ability to resist temperature changes is one of the things that helps keep
the temperature in our oceans fairly stable. It’s also why organisms that are mainly made up of water, like us, are
able to keep a constant body temperature.
Expansion on Freezing
One of the most important properties of water is yet another result of hydrogen bonding. When four water molecules
are bound in a solid lattice of ice, the hydrogen bonds actually cause solid water to expand on freezing. In most
materials, when the molecules lose kinetic ene
