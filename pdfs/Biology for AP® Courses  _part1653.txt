on factors, but the general theme is the same. Eukaryotic transcription is a tightly regulated process that requires a
variety of proteins to interact with each other and with the DNA strand. Although the process of transcription in eukaryotes
involves a greater metabolic investment than in prokaryotes, it ensures that the cell transcribes precisely the pre-mRNAs
that it needs for protein synthesis.

During human embryonic development, a transcription factor encoded by the SRY gene starts a chain of
events, causing the embryo to develop male sex characteristics. This gene is on the Y chromosome in
humans and many other mammals. A deletion or mutation of the SRY gene can cause the human embryo to
not develop into a male even though the individual has an XY genotype, a condition called Swyer syndrome.
Figure 15.12 The SYR gene of the Y chromosome produces proteins that lead to the expression of primary sex
characteristics, as shown.
