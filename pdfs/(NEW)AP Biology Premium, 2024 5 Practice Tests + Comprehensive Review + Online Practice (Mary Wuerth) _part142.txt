er pressure potential (in the straw). An example of positive
pressure potential would be Super Soaker water toys. In those toys, you create positive pressure inside the water toy
by pumping air into the toy. When you pull the trigger on the water toy, water flows out of the higher pressure
potential environment in the toy and into the lower pressure potential environment outside of the toy.
Most biological systems are open to the atmosphere and are in pressure equilibrium with their environment. So in
most cases, the Ïˆp is 0 and the water potential will depend solely on the solute potential. In this case, the water
potential becomes simply:
The solute potential depends on the concentration of the solute, how many particles the solute forms when in
solution, and the temperature of the solution. The solute potential is calculated with this formula:
The ionization constant is i, which is a function of how many particles or ions a solute will form in solution. For
covalent compounds, which
