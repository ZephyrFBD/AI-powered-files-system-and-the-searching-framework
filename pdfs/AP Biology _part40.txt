he lake. This cycling of the nutrients in the
lake is known as the spring overturn and is an important part of
the life cycle of a lake.
pH
pH is a measure of the acidity and alkalinity of a solution. Anything with a
pH of less than 7 is an acid, and anything with a pH value greater than 7 is
alkaline or basic. A pH of 7 is neutral. The value of the pH is the negative
log of the hydrogen ion concentration in moles per liter. See Table 2.1,
which shows pH values compared with molarity.

hydrogen ions in solution, while a substance of pH 4 has a H+
concentration of 1.0 × 10–4 or 0.0001 mole per liter of hydrogen ions in
solution. Therefore,
