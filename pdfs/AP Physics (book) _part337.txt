me amount of matter as on Earth, and will have
just as much inertia—in the absence of friction, it will be just as hard to start it
moving on the Moon as on Earth, or to stop it once it is moving. (More on weight

4–4 Newton’s Second Law of Motion
Newton’s first law states that if no net force is acting on an object at rest, the
object remains at rest; or if the object is moving, it continues moving with constant
speed in a straight line. But what happens if a net force is exerted on an object?
Newton perceived that the object’s velocity will change (Fig. 4–5). A net force
exerted on an object may make its velocity increase. Or, if the net force is in a
direction opposite to the motion, that force will reduce the object’s velocity. If the
net force acts sideways on a moving object, the direction of the object’s velocity
changes. That change in the direction of the velocity is also an acceleration. So a
sideways net force on an object also causes acceleration. In general
