The 8
4Be nucleus is highly unstable (half-life of 7 * 10-17 s) and so falls 
apart almost immediately. In a tiny fraction of cases, however, a third

This stage of nuclear fusion is called helium burning. Notice that car-
bon, element 6, is formed without prior formation of elements 3, 4, 
and 5, explaining in part their unusually low abundance. Nitrogen is 
relatively abundant because it can be produced from carbon through 
a series of rea
