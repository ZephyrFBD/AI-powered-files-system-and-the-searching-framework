 question:
•
What are different ways in which translational and post-translational control of gene expression take place?
Connection for AP® Courses
Changing the status of the RNA or the protein itself can affect the amount of protein produced, the function of the protein,
or how long the protein resides in the cell. Modifications such as phosphorylation and environmental stimuli can affect the
stability and function of the protein.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A Learning Objective merges required content with one or more of the seven Science Practices.
Big Idea 4
Biological systems interact, and these systems and their interactions possess complex
properties.
