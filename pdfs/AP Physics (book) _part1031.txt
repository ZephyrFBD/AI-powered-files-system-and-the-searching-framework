s slightly according to the weather.
At sea level, the pressure of the atmosphere on average is 
(or 
). This value lets us define a commonly used unit of pressure, the
atmosphere (abbreviated atm):
Another unit of pressure sometimes used (in meteorology and on weather maps)
is the bar, which is defined as
Thus standard atmospheric pressure is slightly more than 1 bar.
The pressure due to the weight of the atmosphere is exerted on all objects
immersed in this great sea of air, including our bodies. How does a human body
withstand the enormous pressure on its surface? The answer is that living cells
maintain an internal pressure that closely equals the external pressure, just as 
the pressure inside a balloon closely matches the outside pressure of the atmos-
phere. An automobile tire, because of its rigidity, can maintain internal pressures
much greater than the external pressure.
