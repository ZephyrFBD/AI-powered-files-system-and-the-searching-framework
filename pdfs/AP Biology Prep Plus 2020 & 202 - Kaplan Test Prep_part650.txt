inheritance because the disorder shows up in every generation.
(C)
He is correct. The pedigree supports mitochondrial inheritance.
Some males are carriers, which explains why some of the males
do not display the trait.

6. A flower grower attempting to develop new varieties of a
particular species took pure-breeding white flowers and crossed
them with pure-breeding red flowers. The F1 oﬀspring were all
pink. The flower grower hypothesized that this was the result of
incomplete dominance. In incomplete dominance, two alleles are
expressed. The phenotype that results is intermediate between
the two. In this case, she hypothesized that R is a red allele and
that W is a white allele, so a heterozygote would be pink. Which of
the following would refute the hypothesis that the inheritance of
flower color in this case was incomplete dominance?
Self-crossing the F1 flowers and obtaining oﬀspring that
diﬀered significantly from a 1:2:1 ratio of red:pink:white

Backcrossing the F1 flowers
