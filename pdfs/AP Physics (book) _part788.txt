table, are connected by a stretched spring and then released
(Fig. 7–48). (a) Is there a net external force on the system
before release? (b) Determine the ratio of their speeds,
(c) What is the ratio of their kinetic energies? (d) Describe
the motion of the CM of this system. Ignore mass of spring.

85. A massless spring with spring constant k is placed between
a block of mass m and a block of mass 3m. Initially the
blocks are at rest on a frictionless surface and they are held
together so that the spring between them is compressed by
an amount D from its equilibrium length. The blocks are
then released and the spring pushes them off in opposite
directions. Find the speeds of the two blocks when they
detach from the spring.
*86. A novice pool player is faced with the corner pocket shot
shown in Fig. 7–49. Relative dimensions are also shown.
Should the player worry that this might be a “scratch shot,”
in which the cue ball will
also fall into a pocket?
