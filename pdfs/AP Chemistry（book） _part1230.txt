uch as that shown in Figure 8.4. A measure of 
how much stabilization results from arranging oppositely charged ions in an ionic solid 
is given by the lattice energy, which is the energy required to completely separate one mole 
of a solid ionic compound into its gaseous ions.
To envision this process for NaCl, imagine that the structure in Figure 8.4 expands 
from within, so that the distances between the ions increase until the ions are very far 
apart. This process requires 788 kJ>mol, which is the value of the lattice energy:
 
NaCl1s2 ¡ Na+1g2 + Cl-1g2  ∆Hlattice = +788 kJ>mol 
[8.3]
Notice that this process is highly endothermic. The reverse process—the com-
ing together of Na+1g2 and Cl-1g2 to form NaCl(s)—is therefore highly exothermic 
1∆H = -788 kJ>mol2.
Table 8.1 lists the lattice energies for a number of ionic compounds. The large pos-
itive values indicate that the ions are strongly attracted to one another in ionic solids.
