CHAPTER 24 The Chemistry of Life: Organic and Biological Chemistry
Lipids are compounds derived from glycerol and fatty acids 
and include fats and phospholipids. Fatty acids can be saturated, un-
saturated, cis, or trans depending on their chemical formulas and 
structures.
NUCLEIC ACIDS (SECTION 24.10) Nucleic acids are biopolymers 
that carry the genetic information necessary for cell reproduction; 
they also control cell development through control of protein syn-
thesis. The building blocks of these biopolymers are nucleotides. 
There are two types of nucleic acids, ribonucleic acid (RNA) and de-
oxyribonucleic acid (DNA). These substances consist of a polymeric 
backbone of alternating phosphate and ribose or deoxyribose sugar 
groups with organic bases attached to the sugar molecules. The DNA 
polymer is a double-stranded helix (double helix) held together by 
hydrogen bonding between matching organic bases situated
