 would analyze the 
data to see whether the hypothesis were correct. (d) Could your 
experiments be extended to test the hypothesis for other parts of 
the periodic table, such as the lanthanide or actinide elements?
the single beam splits into two beams? (b) What do you think 
would happen if the strength of the magnet were increased? 
(c) What do you think would happen if the beam of hydro-
gen atoms were replaced with a beam of helium atoms? Why? 
 
(d) The relevant experiment was ﬁrst performed by Otto 
Stern and Walter Gerlach in 1921. They used a beam of Ag 
atoms in the experiment. By considering the electron con-
ﬁguration of a silver atom, explain why the single beam splits 
into two beams.
