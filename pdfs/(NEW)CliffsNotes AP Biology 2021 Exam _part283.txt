normalities as long as the inversion does not introduce any
duplications or deletions.
Translocations occur when a segment of a chromosome is moved to another chromosome. For example, Down
syndrome ordinarily occurs when an individual inherits an extra chromosome 21 (as a result of nondisjunction).
However, Down syndrome can also occur after a translocation of a chromosome segment from chromosome 21 to
chromosome 14. An individual inheriting a chromosome with a 14/21 translocation has a normal number of
chromosomes but inherits three copies of a segment from chromosome 21 (two chromosomes 21 and a chromosome
14 with a segment of chromosome 21). The result has the same phenotypic effect as trisomy 21.
Environmental Influences on Phenotypic Expression
If you have ever compared “identical” twins, you know that, though very similar, they are not identical. Although
their DNA may be identical, the expression of their genes is influenced by environmental factors. Before identical
twins are b
