 13.91  The “free-base” form of cocaine (C17H21NO4) and its pro-
tonated hydrochloride form (C17H22ClNO4) are shown 
below; the free-base form can be converted to the hydro-
chloride form with one equivalent of HCl. For clarity, not 
all the carbon and hydrogen atoms are shown; each vertex 
represents a carbon atom with the appropriate number of 
hydrogen atoms so that each carbon makes four bonds to 
other atoms.
(a)  One of these forms of cocaine is relatively water-soluble: 
which form, the free base or the hydrochloride?
(b) One of these forms of cocaine is relatively insoluble in 
water: which form, the free base or the hydrochloride?
(c) The free-base form of cocaine has a solubility of 1.00 g in 
6.70 mL ethanol (CH3CH2OH). Calculate the molarity 
of a saturated solution of the free-base form of cocaine in 
ethanol.
(d) The hydrochloride form of cocaine has a solubility of 
1.00 g in 0.400 mL water. Calculate the molarity of a sat-
urated solution of the hydrochlo
