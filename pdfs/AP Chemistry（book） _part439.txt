they are in a normal person. A person who has not eaten 
for 8 hours or more is diagnosed as diabetic if his or her glucose level 
is 126 mg/dL or higher.
Glucose meters work by the introduction of blood from a 
person, usually by a prick of the finger, onto a small strip of pa-
per that contains chemicals that react with glucose. Insertion of 
the strip into a small battery-operated reader gives the glucose 
concentration (Figure 3.11). The mechanism of the readout var-
ies from one monitor to another—it may be a measurement of a 
small electrical current or a measurement of light produced in a 
chemical  
reaction. Depending on the reading on any given day, 
a diabetic person may need to receive an injection of insulin or 
simply limit his or her  
intake of sugar-rich foods for a while.
