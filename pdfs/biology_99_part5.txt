. Scientists recently have proposed a reorganization of the phylogenetic system of classification to include the 
domain, a new taxonomic category higher (more inclusive) than the Kingdom category, as shown in the fol- 
lowing diagram. 
 
Universal Ancestor 
 
 
 
 
Domain Bacteria 
Domain Archaea 
Domain Eukarya 
 
(Eubacteria) 
(Archaebacteria) 
(Eukaryotes) 
 
• Describe how this classification scheme presents different conclusions about the relationships among living 
organisms than those presented by the previous five-kingdom system of classification. 
• Describe three kinds of evidence that were used to develop the taxonomic scheme above, and explain how 
this evidence was used. The evidence may be structural, physiological, molecular, and/or genetic. 
• Describe four of the characteristics of the universal ancestor. 
 
 
 
4. Scientists seeking to determine which molecule is responsible for the transmission of characteristics from 
one generation to the next knew that the molecu
