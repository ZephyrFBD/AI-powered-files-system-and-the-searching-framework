thout insecticide is 13.40 and the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for crop A in the
presence of insecticide is 12.90. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that there is a significant difference
between those two groups for crop A.
(d) Many insects consume plant material and are therefore primary consumers. The use of insecticides would
decrease the number of primary consumers and could thereby increase the crop yield.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) Carbon dioxide is a reactant that is consumed during photosynthesis, so measuring the rate of carbon
dioxide consumption could be a good way to compare the rate of photosynthesis between these two
organisms.
(b)
(c) There is likely a statistically significant difference at a temperature of 40째C because the 95% confidence
intervals for the C3 and C4 plants do not overlap at that temperature, but they do overlap at 20째C and 30째C.
(d) The plant would likely consume less carbon dioxide and would perform less photosynthesis in a 39째C
