 zeros are significant. For 
example, a mass of 10,300 g can be written to show three, four, or five significant figures 
depending on how the measurement is obtained:
1.03 * 104 g
(three significant figures)
1.030 * 104 g
(four significant figures)
1.0300 * 104 g
(five significant figures)
In these numbers, all the zeros to the right of the decimal point are significant (rules 1 
and 3). (The exponential term 104 does not add to the number of significant figures.)
 
Sample Exercise 1.7
Determining the Number of Significant Figures in a Measurement
How many significant figures are in each of the following numbers (assume that each number is a measured quantity)?  
(a) 4.003, (b) 6.023 * 1023, (c) 5000.
SOLUTION
(a) Four; the zeros are significant figures. (b) Four; the exponential 
term does not add to the number of significant figures. (c) One; 
we assume that the zeros are not significant when there is no  
decimal point shown. If the number has more significant figures, 
a decimal p
