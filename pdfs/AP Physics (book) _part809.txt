The unit for frequency, revolutions per second (rev s), is given the special name
the hertz (Hz). That is,
Note that “revolution” is not really a unit, so we can also write 
The time required for one complete revolution is called the period T, and it
is related to the frequency by

period of each revolution is 1

EXERCISE A In Example 8–4 we found that the carousel, after 8.0 s, rotates at an 
angular velocity 
and continues to do so after 
because the
acceleration ceased. What are the frequency and period of t
