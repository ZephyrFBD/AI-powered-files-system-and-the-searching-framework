he F508del mutation would not be effective. It would just produce more of the misfolded protein, so
choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because repression of the number of ribosomes would result in
less production of all proteins in the cell. The F508del mutation does not code for a premature stop codon, so
choice (C) is incorrect.
50. (A) Since there would be fewer copies of the CFTR protein, a drug that causes the CFTR channel to stay open
and function longer might help alleviate the symptoms of the disease. Choice (B) is incorrect because
suppression of the expression of the CFTR gene would make the symptoms worse, not better. Similarly,
decreasing the number of chloride ions exiting the cell would also make the symptoms worse, so choice (C) is
incorrect. Stimulating the Na+/K+ pump would not help with the migration of chloride ions, so choice (D) is
incorrect.
51. (A) Since cystic fibrosis is a recessive disorder, an individual would have to inherit a copy of the cysti
