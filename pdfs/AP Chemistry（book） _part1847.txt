ng a and b vectors that 
form a two-dimensional square lattice. Then add a third vector, c, that is of different 
length and perpendicular to the first two. Which of the seven three-dimensional 
lattices results?
If we place a lattice point at each corner of a unit cell, we get a primitive lat-
tice. All seven lattices in Figure 12.6 are primitive lattices. It is also possible to gen-
erate what are called centered lattices by placing additional lattice points in specific 
locations in the unit cell. This is illustrated for a cubic lattice in Figure 12.7. A body- 
centered cubic lattice has one lattice point at the center of the unit cell in addition 
to the lattice points at the eight corners. A face-centered cubic lattice has one lat-
tice point at the center of each of the six faces of the unit cell in addition to the lattice 
points at the eight corners. Centered lattices exist for other types of unit cells as well. 
For the crystals discussed in this chapter we need consider only
