whether a population has a large or small biotic potential, certain
characteristics about growth are common to all organisms.
Exponential Growth
The simplest model for population growth is one with unrestrained or
exponential growth. This population has no predation, parasitism, or

competition. It has no immigration or emigration and is in an environment
with unlimited resources. This is characteristic of a population that has
been recently introduced into an area, such as a sample of bacteria newly
inoculated onto a petri dish. Although exponential growth is usually short-
lived, the human population has been in the exponential growth phase for
over 300 years.
SYI-1
A population can produce a density of individuals that exceeds the systemâ€™s resources.
Carrying Capacity
Ultimately, there is a limit to the number of individuals that can occupy
one area at a particular time. That limit is called the carrying capacity
(K). Each particu
