 If the secondary oocyte is fertilized, the cell continues through the meiosis II, producing a second polar body and a
fertilized egg containing all 46 chromosomes of a human being, half of them coming from the sperm.
Egg production begins before birth, is arrested during meiosis until puberty, and then individual cells continue through at
each menstrual cycle. One egg is produced from each meiotic process, with the extra chromosomes and chromatids going
into polar bodies that degenerate and are reabsorbed by the body.
Think About It
Compare spermatogenesis and oogenesis as to the timing of the processes and the number and type of cells finally
produced.
