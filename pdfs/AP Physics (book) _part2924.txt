ime dilation
allows such a trip, but the enormous practical problems of achieving such speeds
may not be possible to overcome, certainly not in the near future.
When we talk in this Chapter and in the Problems about spaceships moving
at speeds close to c, it is for understanding and for fun, but not realistic, although
for tiny elementary particles such high speeds are realistic.
In this example, 100 years would pass on Earth, whereas only 4.5 years would
pass for the astronaut on the trip. Is it just the clocks that would slow down for the
astronaut? No.
All processes, including aging and other life processes, run more slowly for 
the astronaut as measured by an Earth observer. But to the astronaut, time
would pass in a normal way.
The astronaut would experience 4.5 years of normal sleeping, eating, reading,
and so on. And people on Earth would experience 100 years of ordinary activity.
Twin Paradox
Not long after Einstein proposed the special theory of relativity, an apparent
