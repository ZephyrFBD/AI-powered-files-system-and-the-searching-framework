As shown in the graph, the amount of substrate has reached a saturation point, and adding additional substrate
will not increase the rate further. The reaction rate will remain at the same high level.

The islands are separated by ocean. Allopatric speciation occurs when populations are isolated from each
other. The finch populations are far away from each other and are likely to mate only with those on the same
island. Choice (A) implies that the finches are able to cross between islands, and (B) refers to a natural
disaster. Neither is mentioned in the information provided. Choice (C) describes the finches developing similar
features, but they developed different types of beaks. Only (D) references the isolated populations associated
with allopatric speciatio
