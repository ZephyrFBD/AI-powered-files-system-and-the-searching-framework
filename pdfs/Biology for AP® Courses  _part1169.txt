-optimal conditions under which the parent cell reproduced, it is likely that the daughter

cell cycle.
Treating cancer can be described as a fight against natural biologic processes. Explain what this means in terms of
tumor formation.
a.
Cancer forms when natural defenses are inhibited and cells divide uncontrollably.
b.
Mutated cells undergo apoptosis, causing cells to divide uncontrollably.
c.
Cancer treatment would require inhibiting apoptosis which is a natural defense.
d.
In cancerous cells, apoptosis occurs.
