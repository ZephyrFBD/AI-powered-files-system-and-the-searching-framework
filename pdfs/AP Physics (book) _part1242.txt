15. (II) A 0.25-kg mass at the end of a spring oscillates 2.2
times per second with an amplitude of 0.15 m. Determine 
(a) the speed when it passes the equilibrium point, (b) the
speed when it is 0.10 m from equilibrium, (c) the total
energy of the system, and (d) the equation describing 
the motion of the mass, assuming that at

maximum.
16. (II) It takes a force of 91.0 N to compress the spring of a
toy popgun 0.175 m to “load” a 0.160-kg ball. With what
speed will the ball leave the gun if fired horizontally?
17. (II) If one oscillation has 3.0 times the energy of a second
one of equal frequency and mass, what is the ratio of their
amplitudes?
18. (II) A mass of 240 g oscillates on a horizontal frictionless
surface at a frequency of 2.5 Hz and with amplitude of
4.5 cm. (a) What is the effective spring constant for this
motion? (b) How much energy is involved in this motion?
