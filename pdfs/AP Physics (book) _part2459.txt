imself on another, and ordered the assistant to
lift the cover from a lamp the instant he saw a flash from Galileo’s lamp. Galileo
measured the time between the flash of his lamp and when he received the light
from his assistant’s lamp. The time was so short that Galileo concluded it merely
represented human reaction time, and that the speed of light must be extremely
high.
The first successful determination that the speed of light is finite was made
by the Danish astronomer Ole Roemer (1644–1710). Roemer had noted that the
carefully measured orbital period of Io, a moon of Jupiter with an average period
of 42.5 h, varied slightly, depending on the relative position of Earth and Jupiter.
He attributed this variation in the apparent period to the change in distance
between the Earth and Jupiter during one of Io’s periods, and the time it took
light to travel the extra distance. Roemer concluded that the speed of light—
though great—is finite.
Since then a number of techniques have been
