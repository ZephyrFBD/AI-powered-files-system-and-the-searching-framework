81. Astronomers estimate that a 2.0-km-diameter asteroid collides
with the Earth once every million years. The collision could
pose a threat to life on Earth. (a) Assume a spherical asteroid
has a mass of 3200 kg for each cubic meter of volume and
moves toward the Earth at

(b) For comparison, a nuclear bomb could release about
How many such bombs would have to explode
simultaneously to release the destructive energy of the
asteroid collision with the Earth?
