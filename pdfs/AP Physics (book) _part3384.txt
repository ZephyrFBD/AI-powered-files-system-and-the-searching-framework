ecay of the parent acts as a bottleneck to the decay of the daughter. Compared
to the 1600-yr half-life of 
for example, its daughter 
decays almost
immediately, but it cannot decay until it is made. (This is like an automobile
assembly line: if worker A takes 20 minutes to do a task and then worker B
takes only 1 minute to do the next task, worker B still does only one car every
20 minutes.)

1 Radioactive Dating
Radioactive decay has many interesting applications. One is the technique of
radioactive dating by which the age of ancient materials can be determined.
The age of any object made from once-living matter, such as wood, can be
determined using the natural radioactivity of 
All living plants absorb carbon
dioxide 
from the air and use it to synthesize organic molecules. The vast
majority of these carbon atoms are 
but a small fraction, about

The ratio of

remained roughly constant over many thousands of years, in spite
