ntical, but it is
still helpful to list each gamete individually on the square.
Now we can fill in the four boxes by matching the letters. What are the results for the F1 generation?
Each offspring received one allele from each parent. They all received one T and one t. They’re all Tt! So, even
though the parents were homozygous, offspring are heterozygous: they possess one copy of each allele.
The Law of Segregation
Next, Mendel took the offspring and self-pollinated them. Let’s use a Punnett square to spell out the results. This
time we’re mating the offspring of the first generation—F1; we are crossing those heterozygotes. Take a look at the
results:
Check out the lower right box. One of the offspring could be a short pea plant!
Although all of the F1 plants were tall, they were heterozygotes that could make gametes containing the short t
allele. In other words, their T and t alleles were segregated (separated) during gamete formation. This is an example
of the Law of Segregation. I
