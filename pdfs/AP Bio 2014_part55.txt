stickleback population summarized in Figure 1 ? 
(A) Analysis of somatic cells using chromosomal 
staining and light microscopy indicates that 
stickleback fish have a diploid number 
of 42. 
(B) Stickleback males from natural freshwater 
populations are typically more aggressive 
when competing for mates than are 
stickleback males from laboratory-bred 
populations. 
(C) Fish exhibiting the low-plated phenotype 
were selected against in the Lake 
Washington stickleback population  
over the last 50 years. 
(D) Migration of individuals from other 
freshwater environments to Lake 
Washington led to gene flow between 
populations that were once geographically 
isolated. 
 
17. A completely-plated stickleback from a marine 
population was mated to a low-plated stickleback 
from a freshwater population. The resulting F1 
hybrids all displayed a completely plated 
phenotype. When the F1 hybrids were allowed to 
interbreed, the resulting F2 generation included 
completely plat
