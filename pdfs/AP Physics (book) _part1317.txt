he
intensity is what is heard as beats.â€  In this case the beats are 0.10 s apart. That is,
the beat frequency is ten per second, or 10 Hz. This result, that the beat frequency
equals the difference in frequency of the two waves, is valid in general.
The phenomenon of beats can occur with any kind of wave and is a very 
sensitive method for comparing frequencies. For example, to tune a piano, a piano
tuner listens for beats produced between his standard tuning fork and the frequency
of a particular string on the piano, and knows it is in tune when the beats disappear.
The members of an orchestra tune up by listening for beats between their instru-
ments and the frequency of a standard tone (usually A above middle C at 440 Hz)
produced by a piano or an oboe. Humans hear the individual beats if they are only
a few per second. For higher beat frequencies, they run together and up to about
20 Hz or so you hear an intensity modulation (a wavering between loud and soft);
above 20 Hz you hear
