Check We can check how reasonable our result is by doing a 
ballpark estimate of the mass of H2O. Because the molar mass of 
glucose is 180 g>mol, 1 g of glucose equals 1>180 mol. Because 
1 mol of glucose yields 6 mol H2O, we would have 6>180 =
1>30 mol H2O. The molar mass of water is 18 g>mol, so we have 
1>30 * 18 = 6>10 = 0.6 g of H2O, which agrees with the full 
calculation. The units, grams H2O, are correct. The initial data 
had three significant figures, so three significant figures for the 
answer is correct.
