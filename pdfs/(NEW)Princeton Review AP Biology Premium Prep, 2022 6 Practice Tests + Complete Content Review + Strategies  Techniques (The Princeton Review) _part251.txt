2. Binding of Inhibitor Y as shown below inhibits a key catalytic enzyme by inducing a structural conformation
change. Which of the following accurately describes the role of Inhibitor Y?
(A) Inhibitor Y competes with substrates for binding in the active site and functions as a competitive inhibitor.
(B) Inhibitor Y binds allosterically and functions as a competitive inhibitor.
