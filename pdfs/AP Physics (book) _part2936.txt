6–6) so that the train momentarily disappears
from view inside the tunnel. Observers on the train measure the train’s length
to be 500 m and the tunnel’s length to be only 80 m (Exercise C, using Eq. 26–3a).
Clearly a 500-m-long train cannot fit inside an 80-m-long tunnel. How is this
apparent inconsistency explained?
RESPONSE Events simultaneous in one reference frame may not be simultane-
ous in another. Let the engine emerging from one end of the tunnel be “event A,”
and the last car disappearing into the other end of the tunnel “event B.” To
observers in the Earth frame, events A and B are simultaneous. To observers on
the train, however, the events are not simultaneous. In the train’s frame, event A
occurs before event B. As the engine emerges from the tunnel, observers on the
train observe the last car as still
from the entrance to
the tunnel.

Let us imagine a person is on a train moving at a very high speed, say 0.65c,
