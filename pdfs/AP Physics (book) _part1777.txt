DNA Structure and Replication
The study of the structure and functioning of a living cell at the molecular level 
is known as molecular biology. It is an important area for application of physics.
The interior of every biological cell is mainly water. We can imagine a cell as a thick
soup of molecules continually in motion (kinetic theory, Chapter 13), colliding with
one another with various amounts of kinetic energy. These molecules interact
with one another because of the electrostatic force between molecules.
Indeed, cellular processes are now considered to be the result of random
(“thermal”) molecular motion plus the ordering effect of the electrostatic force. As
an example, we look at DNA structure and replication. The picture we pre
