Cellular respiration must be regulated in order to provide balanced amounts of energy in the form of ATP. The cell also must
generate a number of intermediate compounds that are used in the anabolism and catabolism of macromolecules. Without
controls, metabolic reactions would quickly come to a stand-still as the forward and backward reactions reached a state of
