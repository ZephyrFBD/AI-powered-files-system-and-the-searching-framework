 random pieces of DNA from one organism to another.
The ability of GTAs to act with high frequency has been demonstrated in controlled studies using marine bacteria. Gene
transfer events in marine prokaryotes, either by GTAs or by viruses, have been estimated to be as high as 1013 per year in
the Mediterranean Sea alone. GTAs and viruses are thought to be efficient HGT vehicles with a major impact on prokaryotic
evolution.
As a consequence of this modern DNA analysis, the idea that eukaryotes evolved directly from Archaea has fallen out of
favor. While eukaryotes share many features that are absent in bacteria, such as the TATA box (found in the promoter region
of many genes), the discovery that some eukaryotic genes were more homologous with bacterial DNA than Archaea DNA
made this idea less tenable. Furthermore, the fusion of genomes from Archaea and Bacteria by endosymbiosis has been
proposed as the ultimate event in eukaryotic evolution.
