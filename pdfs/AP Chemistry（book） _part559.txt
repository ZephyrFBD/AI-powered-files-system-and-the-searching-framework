CHAPTER 4 Reactions in Aqueous Solution
4.3 ∣  
Acids, Bases, and Neutralization 
Reactions
Many acids and bases are industrial and household substances (Figure 4.5), and some are 
important components of biological fluids. Hydrochloric acid, for example, is an import-
ant industrial chemical and the main constituent of gastric juice in your stomach. Acids 
and bases are also common electrolytes.
Acids
As noted in Section 2.8, acids are substances that ionize in aqueous solution to form 
hydrogen ions H +1aq2. Because a hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron, 
H+ is simply a proton. Thus, acids are often called proton donors. Molecular models of four 
common acids are shown in Figure 4.6.

bases. Vinegar and lemon juice are common 
household acids. Ammonia and baking 
soda (sodium bicarbonate) are common 
household bases.
