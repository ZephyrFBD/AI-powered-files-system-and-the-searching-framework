Characteristics of a 
STRONG Response
A strong student will be able to identify a microbe as 
photosynthetic if it had evidence of photosynthetic pigments 
or a photosynthetic membrane within the cell. The student

the student may state that the lack of photosynthetic 
structures or evidence of oxygen would suggest this microbe 
was not photosynthetic.
Characteristics of a 
GOOD Response 
A good student would be able to cite one piece of eviden
