ie. I said that was one sick child. 
 
 Malachy is clutching himself.Have to pee.Have to pee. 
 
 So, pee awready.You boys pee and we see you mother. 
 
 After we pee Mrs.Leibowitz comes to see Mam.Oh,Mrs.McCourt. 
 
 Oy vey, darlink. Look at this. Look at these twins. Naked. Mrs. 
 
 McCourt, what is mazzer, eh? The baby she is sick? So talk to me. Poor 
 
 woman. Here turn around, missus.Talk to me.Oy, this is one mess.Talk 
 
 to me,Mrs.McCourt. 
 
 She helps my mother sit up against the wall. Mam seems smaller. 
 
 Mrs. Leibowitz says she’ll bring some soup and tells me get some 
 
 water to wash my mother’s face. I dip a towel in cold water and pat her 
 
 forehead. She presses my hand against her cheeks. Oh, Jesus, Frankie. 
 
 Oh, Jesus. She won’t let my hand go and I’m frightened because I’ve 
 
 never seen her like this before. She’s saying Frankie only because it’s 
 
 my hand she’s holding and it’s Margaret she’s thinking about, not me. 
 
 Your lovely little sister is dead,
