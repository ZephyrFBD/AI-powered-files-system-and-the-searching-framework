30–3 to 30–7 Radioactive Decay
22. (I) The 
nucleus has an excited state 0.48 MeV above the
ground state. What wavelength gamma photon is emitted
when the nucleus decays from the excited state to the ground
state?
23. (II) Show that the decay
is not possible
because energy would not be conserved.
24. (II) Calculate the energy released when tritium,
decays
by 
emission.
25. (II) What is the maximum kinetic energy of an electron
emitted in the 
decay of a free neutron?
26. (II) Give the result of a calculation that shows whether or
not the following decays are po
