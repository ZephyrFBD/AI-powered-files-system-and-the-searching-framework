Some prokaryotes, however, cannot grow in a laboratory setting. In fact, over 99 percent of bacteria and archaea are
unculturable. For the most part, this is due to a lack of knowledge as to what to feed these organisms and how to grow them;
they have special requirements for growth that remain unknown to scientists, such as needing specific micronutrients, pH,
temperature, pressure, co-factors, or co-metabolites. Some bacteria cannot be cultured because they are obligate intracellular
parasites and cannot be grown outside a host cell.
In other cases, culturable organisms become unculturable under stressful conditions, even though the same organism could
be cultured previously. Those organisms that cannot be cultured but are not dead are in a viable-but-non-culturable
(VBNC) state. The VBNC state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental stressors by entering
