methane?
 12.82  The molecular formula of n-decane is CH31CH228CH3. De-
cane is not considered a polymer, whereas polyethylene is. 
What is the distinction?
 12.83  State whether each of these numbers is a reasonable value 
for a polymerâ€™s molecular weight: 100 amu, 10,000 amu, 
100,000 amu, 1,000,000 amu?
 12.84  Indicate whether the following statement is true or false: 
For an addition polymerization, there are no by-products of 
the reaction (assuming 100% yield).
 12.85  An ester is a compound formed by a condensation reaction 
between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol that eliminates a 
water molecule. Read the discussion of esters in Section 24.4 
and then give an example of a reaction forming an ester. 
How might this kind of reaction be extended to form a poly-
mer (a polyester)?
 12.86  Write a balanced chemical equation for the formation of a 
polymer via a condensation reaction from the monomers 
succinic acid 1HOOCCH2CH2COOH2 and ethylenediamine 
1H2NCH2CH2NH22.
