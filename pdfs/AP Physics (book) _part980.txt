Summary
APPROACH We can find the vertical component 
exerted upward by each
buttress because each supports 
of the dome’s weight. We find 
knowing
that the buttress needs to be under compression so
acts at a 38°
angle.
SOLUTION The vertical load on each buttress is 
of the total weight. Thus
The force must act at a 38° angle at the base of the dome in order to be purely
compressive. Thus
NOTE For each buttress to exert this 420,000-N horizontal force, a prestressed-
concrete tension ring surrounds the base of the buttresses beneath the ground
(see Problem 58 and Fig. 9–77).
