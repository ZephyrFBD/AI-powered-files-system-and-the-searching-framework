4. Laser light can be focused (at best) to a spot with a radius r
equal to its wavelength 
Suppose a 1.0-W beam of green
laser light 
forms such a spot and illuminates
a cylindrical object of radius r and length r (Fig. 22–23).
Estimate (a) the radiation pressure and force on the object,
and (b) its acceleration, if its density equals that of water
and it absorbs all the radiation. [This order-of-magnitude
calculation convinced researchers of the feasibility of “optical
tweezers,” page 636.]
