etters” in the mRNA and protein “alphabets,” scientists theorized that combinations of
nucleotides corresponded to single amino acids. Nucleotide doublets would not be sufficient to specify every amino acid
because there are only 16 possible two-nucleotide combinations (42). In contrast, there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets
(43), which is far more than the number of amino acids. Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide
triplets and that the genetic code was degenerate. In other words, a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one
nucleotide triplet. This was later confirmed experimentally; Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner used the chemical mutagen
proflavin to insert one, two, or three nucleotides into the gene of a virus. When one or two nucleotides were inserted, protein
synthesis was completely abolished. When three nucleotides were inserted, the protein was synthesized and functional. This
