(b) O3 is isoelectronic with NO2
-; both have 18 valence electrons.  
(c) Since each N ¬O bond has partial double-bond character, the 
N ¬O bond length in NO2
- should be shorter than an N ¬ O single 
bond but longer than an N “O double bond. 8.55 The more elec-
tron pairs shared by two atoms, the shorter the bond. Thus, the C ¬ O 
bond lengths vary in the order CO 6 CO2 6 CO3
2 -. 8.57 (a) False 
(b) false 8.59 (a) AsF5 is an exception to the octet rule. (b) BCl3 is an 
exception to the octet rule. 8.61 Assume that the dominant structure 
is the one that minimizes formal charge. Following this guideline, 
only ClO- obeys the octet rule. ClO, ClO2
-, ClO3
-, and ClO4
- do not 
obey the octet rule.
