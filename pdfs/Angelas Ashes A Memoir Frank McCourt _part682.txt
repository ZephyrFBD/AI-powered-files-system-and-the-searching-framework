about love and the body and one of his 
 
 words sends me to the dictionary.Turgid. He says, The male organ of 
 
 copulation becomes turgid and is inserted into the receptive female 
 
 orifice. 
 
 Turgid.The dictionary says swollen and that’s what I am, standing 
 
 there looking at the dictionary because I know now what Mikey Molloy 
 
 was talking about all along, that we’re no different from the dogs that 
 
 get stuck in each other in the streets and it’s shocking to think of all the 
 
 mothers and fathers doing the likes of this. 
 
 My father lied to me for years about the Angel on the Seventh Step. 
 
 Miss O’Riordan wants to know what word I’m looking for. She 
 
 always looks worried when I’m at the dictionary so I tell her I’m looking 
 
  
  
 for canonize or beatific or any class of a religious word. 
 
 And what’s this? she says.This is not the Lives of the Saints. 
 
 She picks up Lin Yütang and starts reading the page where I left the 
 
 book face down on the table.
