ons are negative; the negative values merely indicate 
how these reductions compare to the reference reaction, the 
reduction of H+1aq2.

CHAPTER 20 Electrochemistry
Strengths of Oxidizing and Reducing agents
Table 20.1 lists half-reactions in the order of decreasing tendency to undergo reduction. 
For example, F2 is located at the top of the table, having the most positive value for E °
red. 
Thus, F2 is the most easily reduced species in Table 20.1 and therefore the strongest oxi-
dizing agent listed.
Among the most frequently used oxidizing agents are the halogens, O2, and oxyan-
ions such as MnO4
-, Cr2O7
2-, and NO3
-, whose central atoms have high positive oxida-
tion states. As seen in Table 20.1, all these species have large positive values of E°
red and 
therefore easily undergo reduction.
The lower the tendency for a half-reaction to occur in one direction, the greater the 
tendency for it to occur in the opposite direction. Thus, the half-reaction with the most
