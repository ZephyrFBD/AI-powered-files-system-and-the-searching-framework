 in water. The solubility of a slightly sol-
uble ionic compound is decreased by the presence of a second 
solute that furnishes a common ion (the common-ion effect). The 
solubility of compounds containing basic anions increases as the 
solution is made more acidic (as pH decreases). Salts with anions 
of negligible basicity (the anions of strong acids) are unaffected by 
pH changes.
The solubility of metal salts is also affected by the presence of 
certain Lewis bases that react with metal ions to form stable complex 
ions. Complex-ion formation in aqueous solution involves the dis-
placement by Lewis bases (such as NH3 and CN-) of water molecules 
attached to the metal ion. The extent to which such complex forma-
tion occurs is expressed quantitatively by the formation constant for 
the complex ion. Amphoteric oxides and hydroxides are those that are 
only slightly soluble in water but dissolve on addition of either acid 
or base.
