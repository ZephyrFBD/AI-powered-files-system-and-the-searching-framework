ch causes water to hold less dissolved oxygen.
These together contribute to a decrease in the level of dissolved oxygen in the bay.
(b) In spring, rain and melting snow cause large volumes of water to flow into the bay.
Based on an analysis of the data, identify the seasonal trends of algal blooms, of
dissolved nitrogen, and of dissolved phosphorus. (3 points maximum)
Explanation (1 point each, 3 points maximum)
Bacteria that decompose dead algal blooms consume dissolved oxygen.
Warmer water holds less dissolved oxygen; oxygen escapes to the atmosphere.
Explanation (1 point each, 3 points maximum)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
According to the data, in the spring (March and April), dissolved nitrogen and dissolved
phosphorus both increased in the bay. This suggests the rain and melting snow that flowed
into the bay contained nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural fields and industrial
facilities. An increase in nutrients (dissolved nitrogen and phosphor
