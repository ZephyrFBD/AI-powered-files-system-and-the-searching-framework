were defined independently. The ampere, the unit of current, is now defined in
terms of the magnetic field it produces using the defined value of 
In particular, we use the force between two parallel current-carrying wires,
Eq. 20–7, to define the ampere precisely. If
exactly, and the two
wires are exactly 1 m apart, then
Thus, one ampere is defined as that current flowing in each of two long parallel wires,
1 m apart, which results in a force of exactly
per meter of length of each wire.
This is the precise definition of the ampere, and because it is readily repro-
ducible, is called an operational definition. The coulomb is defined in terms of
the ampere as being exactly one ampere-second: 1 C = 1 As.

A long coil of wire consisting of many loops (or turns) of wire is called a solenoid.
