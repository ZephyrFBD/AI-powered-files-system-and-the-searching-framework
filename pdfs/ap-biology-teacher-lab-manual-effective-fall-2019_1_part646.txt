Estimating Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of Fast Plants 
Step 1 Students should create a diagram to model energy capture and flow through a plant 
(see Figure 4). This will help their lab team design the data collection procedure that 
helps measure energy capture and flow in a plant.

Steps 2–3 As a team, students will design their investigation to sample the biomass of 
an adequate number of plants early in the life cycle and then again later in the life cycle. 
Remind students that biomass is only the mass of the plant materials, not of the water 
in the plant. Make sure that the students’ procedures account for this. On Day 7 (about 
one-fifth of the way through a life cycle), students should remove approximately 10 
plants from the soil, maki
