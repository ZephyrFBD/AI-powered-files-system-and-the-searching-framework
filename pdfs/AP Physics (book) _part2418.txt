*65. (II) An ac voltage source is connected in series with a
capacitor and a
resistor. Using a digital ac
voltmeter, the amplitude of the voltage source is measured
to be 4.0 V rms, while the voltages across the resistor and
across the capacitor are found to be 3.0 V rms and 2.7 V rms,
respectively. Determine the frequency of the ac voltage
source. Why is the voltage measured across the voltage source
not equal to the sum of the voltages measured across the
resistor and across the capacitor?
