so shared a common ancestor.
Embryology, or the study of development of an organism: if you look at the early stages in vertebrate
development, all embryos look alike! For example, all vertebrates—including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds,
and even mammals such as humans—show fishlike features called gill slits.
Morphological homologies, or the study of the anatomy of various animals: scientists have discovered that
some animals have similar structures that serve different functions. For example, a human’s arm, a dog’s leg, a
bird’s wing, and a whale’s fin are all the same appendages, though they have evolved to serve different
purposes. These structures, called homologous structures, also point to a common ancestor.
In contrast, sometimes animals have features with the same function but that are structurally different. A bat’s
wing and an insect’s wing, for example, are both used to fly. They therefore have the same function, but they
have evolved totally independently of one anothe
