 of energy. He 
proposed that all spontaneous chemical and physical changes are exothermic. It takes 
only a few moments, however, to find exceptions to this generalization. For example, the 
melting of ice at room temperature is spontaneous and endothermic. Similarly, many 
spontaneous dissolution processes, such as the dissolving of NH4NO3, are endothermic, 
as we discovered in Section 13.1. We conclude that although the majority of spontaneous 
reactions are exothermic, there are spontaneous endothermic ones as well. Clearly, some 
other factor must be at work in determining the natural direction of processes.
To understand why certain processes are spontaneous, we need to consider more 
closely the ways in which the state of a system can change. Recall from Section 5.2 
that quantities such as temperature, internal energy, and enthalpy are state functions, 
properties that define a state and do not depend on how we reach that state. The heat 
transferred between the system and its
