der/ 
float, and dunk the tubes into the water bath, set at 42°C, for exactly 50 seconds. Make 
sure to push the tubes all the way down in the holder so that the bottom of the tubes 
with the suspension makes contact with the warm water. 
Step 12 When the 50 seconds have passed, place both tubes back on ice. For best 
transformation results, the change from 0°C to 42°C and then back to 0°C must be rapid. 
Incubate the tubes on ice for an additional two minutes. 
Step 13 Remove the holder containing the tubes from the ice and place on the lab counter. 
Using a 100–1,000 μL micropipette with sterile tip, transfer 250 μL of LB nutrient broth 
to the “+ plasmid” tube. Close the tube and gently tap with your finger to mix. Repeat 
with a new sterile micropipette for the “- plasmid” tube. 
Step 14 Incubate each tube for 10 minutes at room temperature. 
Step 15 Use a 10–1,000 μL micropipette with sterile tip to transfer 100 μL of the 
transformation (“+ plasmid”) and control (“- plasmid”) sus
