eedback response causes the anterior pituitary to stop production of LH and FSH. As a result, the follicle
stops producing estrogen and progesterone, and the endometrium is sloughed off.
If the egg becomes fertilized and implants into the endometrium, cells from the developing embryo secrete human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which induces the corpus luteum to continue production of progesterone, which, in
turn, maintains the endometrium.
Both questions 1 and 2 require a discussion of the reproductive processes, but their focuses are different. In
answering the first question, you need to state the similarities and differences (compare and contrast) between males
and females. Details of hormone regulation alone would not address the question. In answering the second question,
however, the details of hormone regulation (and feedback loops) are exactly what you need to discuss (but only for
females). Note that in the answer to the first question, the two parts (compare and contrast) are
