the rest of the world?
a.
It has been suggested that all humans most likely descended from Africa. This is supported by the research
that genetic variance in Africa was also found in the rest of the world.
b.
The theory that humans descended from Africa was supported by the research that most of the human
genomes tested outside of Africa had close ties to the genomes of people in Africa but a genetic variance in
Africa was not found in the rest of the world.
c.
Humans have most likely descended from Africa. This research is supported by the fact that all the human
genomes tested outside of Africa had close ties to the genomes of people in Africa. Also, there is a genetic
variance in Africa that was not found in the rest of the world.
d.
The transition to modern humans occurred within Africa which was sudden. Thus, human genomes tested
outside of Africa had close ties to the genomes of people in Africa.
