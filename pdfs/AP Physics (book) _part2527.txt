from the mirror such that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.

Finding the image position
for a curved mirror
Many rays could be drawn leaving any point on an object, but determining the image
position is faster if we deal with three particular rays. These are the rays labeled 
1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 23–15 and we draw them leaving object point 
as follows:
Ray 1 leaving 
is drawn parallel to the axis; therefore after reflection it must
pass along a line through F, Fig. 23–15a (just as parallel rays did in Fig. 23–14).
Ray 2 leaves 
and is made to pass through F (Fig. 23–15b); therefore it must
reflect so it is parallel to the axis. (In reverse, a parallel ray passes through F.)
Ray 3 is drawn along a radius of the spherical surface (Fig. 23–15c) and is
perpendicular to the mirror, so it is reflected back on itself and passes
through C, the center of curvature.
All three r
