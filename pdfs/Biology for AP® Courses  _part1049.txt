sis. The glucose is then available for use by the muscle
cell in response to a sudden surge of adrenaline—the “fight or flight” reflex.
Cell Growth
Cell signaling pathways also play a major role in cell division. Cells do not normally divide unless they are stimulated
by signals from other cells. The ligands that promote cell growth are called growth factors. Most growth factors bind to
cell-surface receptors that are linked to tyrosine kinases. These cell-surface receptors are called receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs). Activation of RTKs initiates a signaling pathway that includes a G-protein called RAS, which activates the MAP
kinase pathway described earlier. The enzyme MAP kinase then stimulates the expression of proteins that interact with other
cellular components to initiate cell division.
