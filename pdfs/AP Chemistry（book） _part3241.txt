H2 = 1.00. One electrode is immersed in 
pure H2O and the other in 6.0 M hydrochloric acid. What is 
the emf generated by the cell, and what is the identity of the 
electrode that is immersed in hydrochloric acid? 
(a) -0.23 V, cathode 
(b) 0.46 V, anode 
(c) 0.023 V, anode 
(d) 0.23 V, cathode 
(e) 0.23 V, anode
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
A concentration cell is constructed with two Zn1s2-Zn2+1aq2 
half-cells. In one half-cell 3Zn2+4 = 1.35 M, and in the other 
3Zn2+4 = 3.75 * 10-4 M. (a) Which half-cell is the anode? 
(b) What is the emf of the cell?

batteries are connected in series, as in most 
flashlights, the total voltage is the sum of 
the individual voltages.

CHAPTER 20 Electrochemistry
As we consider some common batteries, notice how the principles we have discussed 
so far help us understand these important sources of portable electrical energy.
