 each molecule in the mixture.
Four olfactory sensors, each innervated by a nerve that
transmits information to the brain as an action potential,
are shown in the diagram at the right. Three of the sensors
each respond to one of the three odor molecules in the
geometric representation of the odorant mixture.
A. In the diagram the odorant-receptor pairing is imagined
geometrically; a round peg fits in a round hold and a
square peg does not. The receptors are located in the
epidermal cell surface, shown in the drawing as a light
gray line. Create a geometric representation by drawing
receptors on the surfaces of the sensors that are activated
by one of the molecules in the mixture. Draw a geometric
representation of a fourth receptor surface that is not
activated by a molecule in the odorant mixture.

In the receptor cell labeled A, two signaling molecules
S1M and S2M are shown as are two types of gated ion
channels; one that transports Ca+2 in response to S1M
