 is kinetic friction, when one object
slides over another. There is also static friction, which refers to a force parallel to
the two surfaces that can arise even when they are not sliding. Suppose an object
such as a desk is resting on a horizontal floor. If no horizontal force is exerted on
the desk, there also is no friction force. But now suppose you try to push the 
desk, and it doesn’t move. You are exerting a horizontal force, but the desk isn’t
moving, so there must be another force on the desk keeping it from moving (the
net force is zero on an object at rest). This is the force of static friction exerted
by the floor on the desk. If you push with a greater force without moving the desk,
the force of static friction also has increased. If you push hard enough, the desk will
eventually start to move, and kinetic friction takes over. At this point, you have
exceeded the maximum force of static friction, which is given by  
where 
is the coefficient of static friction (Table 4–2)
