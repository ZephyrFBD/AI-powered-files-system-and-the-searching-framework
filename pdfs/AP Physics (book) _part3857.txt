 molar specific heat at constant volume would be
close to measured values (Table D–1). More complex mole-
cules have even more degrees of freedom and thus greater molar specific heats.
However, measurements showed that for diatomic gases at very low temper-
atures,
has a value of only
as if it had only three degrees of freedom. And
at very high temperatures,
was about 
as if there were seven degrees of
freedom. The explanation is that at low temperatures, nearly all molecules have
only translational kinetic energy; that is, no energy goes into rotational energy and
only three degrees of freedom are “active.” At very high temperatures, all five
degrees of freedom are active plus two additional ones. We interpret the two new
degrees of freedom as being associated with the two atoms vibrating, as if they were
connected by a spring (Fig. D–2). One degree of freedom comes from the kinetic
energy of the vibrational motion, and the second comes from the potential energy
of vibrational motion
