CHAPTER 22 Chemistry of the Nonmetals
Calcium hydride 1CaH22 is used to inflate life rafts, weather balloons, and the like 
where a simple, compact means of generating H2 is desired (Figure 22.5).
Metallic hydrides are formed when hydrogen reacts with transition metals. These 
compounds are so named because they retain their metallic properties. In many metal-
lic hydrides, the ratio of metal atoms t
