to move the crate at a steady speed across the floor? What
horizontal force is required if 
is zero?
37. (I) A force of 35.0 N is required to start a 6.0-kg box moving
across a horizontal concrete floor. (a) What is the coefficient
of static friction between the box and the floor? (b) If the
35.0-N force continues, the box accelerates at 
What is the coefficient of kinetic friction?
38. (I) Suppose you are standing on a train accelerating at
0.20 g. What minimum coefficient of static friction must
exist between your feet and the floor if you are not to slide?
39. (II) The coefficient of static friction between hard rubber
and normal street pavement is about 0.90. On how steep 
a hill (maximum angle) can you leave a car parked?
40. (II) A flatbed truck is carrying a heavy crate. The coeffi-
cient of static friction between the crate and the bed of 
the truck is 0.75. What is the maximum rate at which the
driver can decelerate and still avoid having the crate slide
against the cab of
