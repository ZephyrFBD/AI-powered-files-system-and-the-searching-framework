At room temperature, these two degrees of freedom
are apparently not active (Fig. D–3). Why fewer degrees of freedom are “active”
at lower temperatures was eventually explained by Einstein using quantum theory.

can vibrate, as if the two atoms were
connected by a spring. They aren’t,
but rather they exert forces on each
other that are electrical in nature—of
a form that resembles a spring force.
