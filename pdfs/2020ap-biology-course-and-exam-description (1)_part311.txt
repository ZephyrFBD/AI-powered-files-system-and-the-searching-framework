nkton biomass in two sides of 
a small lake that is divided by an impermeable 
curtain
In the early 1970s, researchers hypothesized that carbon was the limiting nutrient 
in many aquatic ecosystems. To test this hypothesis, the researchers divided a small 
lake in two roughly equal halves with an impermeable curtain that was fastened and 
sealed to the bedrock of the lake. Beginning in 1971 the researchers treated one side 
of the lake with sucrose and the other side with both sucrose and phosphate. From 
1971 to 1983 the researchers monitored the phytoplankton biomass in both parts of 
the lake. The results are shown in Figure 1.
4.	 Which of the following claims is best supported by the data?
(A)	Carbon was a limiting factor for phytoplankton in the lake.
(B)	 Phosphate was a limiting factor for phytoplankton in the lake.
(C)	 Both carbon and phosphate were limiting factors for phytoplankton in the lake.
(D)	Neither carbon nor phosphate was a limiting factor for phytoplankton in 
the
