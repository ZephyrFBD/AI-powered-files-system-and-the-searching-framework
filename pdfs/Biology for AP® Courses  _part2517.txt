nean from a Lebanon power plant (2006), and more recently, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico (2010). To clean up these spills, bioremediation is promoted by the addition of inorganic nutrients that help bacteria
to grow. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria feed on hydrocarbons in the oil droplet, breaking down the hydrocarbons. Some
species, such as Alcanivorax borkumensis, produce surfactants that solubilize the oil, whereas other bacteria degrade the
oil into carbon dioxide. In the case of oil spills in the ocean, ongoing, natural bioremediation tends to occur, inasmuch as
there are oil-consuming bacteria in the ocean prior to the spill. In addition to naturally occurring oil-degrading bacteria,
humans select and engineer bacteria that possess the same capability with increased efficacy and spectrum of hydrocarbon
compounds that can be processed. Under ideal conditions, it has been reported that up to 80 percent of the nonvolatile
components in oil can be degraded with
