(a) On the axes provided, create an appropriately labeled graph to illustrate the sample means of the  
three populations to within 95% confidence (i.e., sample mean plus or minus 2 S E M). 
(b) Based on the sample means and standard errors of the means, identify the two populations that are most 
likely to have statistically significant differences in the mean stem trichome densities. Justify your response. 
(c) Describe the independent and dependent variables and a control treatment for an experiment to test the 
hypothesis that higher trichome density in plants is selected for in the presence of herbivores. Identify an 
appropriate duration of the experiment to ensure that natural selection is measured, and predict the 
experimental results that would support the hypothesis.
