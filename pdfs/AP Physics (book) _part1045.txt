SECTION 10–7
Buoyancy and Archimedes’ Principle
269
We can derive Archimedes’ principle in general by the following simple but
elegant argument. The irregularly shaped object D shown in Fig. 10–11a is acted
on by the force of gravity (its weight,
downward) and the buoyant force,
upward. We wish to determine 
To do so, we next consider a body (
in 
Fig. 10–11b), this time made of the fluid itself, with the same shape and size as the
original object, and located at the same depth. You might think of this body of
fluid as being separated from the rest of the fluid by an imaginary membrane.
The buoyant force 
on this body of fluid will be exactly the same
