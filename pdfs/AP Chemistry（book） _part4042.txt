2p to p*2p (d) 7.0 * 102 kJ/mol (e) The bond order of 
the N—N bond in the ﬁrst excited state is smaller and the bond is 
weaker than in the ground state. The silicon analogs would have the 
same hybridization as the C compounds. Silicon, which is in the row 
below C, has a larger bonding atomic radius and atomic orbitals than 
C. The close approach of Si atoms required to form strong, stable p 
bonds in Si2H4 and Si2H2 is not possible and these Si analogs do not 
readily form. 9.108 The white solid has the larger HOMO-LUMO gap 
because it absorbs higher energy light than the green solid absorbs.
