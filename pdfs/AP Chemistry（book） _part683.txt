icity from coal, the heating of homes 
by natural gas, and the use of batteries to power electronic devices are 
all examples of how chemical reactions are used to produce energy. But 
that’s only the beginning. Chemical reactions provide the energy that 
sustains living systems. Plants use solar energy to carry out photosyn-
thesis, allowing them to grow. In the process, they store a portion of the 
Sun’s energy in the chemical bonds of the molecules that are produced 
during photosynthesis. When animals eat and digest plants, they derive 
the energy needed to move, maintain body temperature, and carry out 
all other bodily functions from that same chemical energy.
In this chapter we begin to explore energy and its changes. We are 
motivated not only by the impact of energy on so many aspects of our 
daily lives but also because if we are to properly understand chemistry, we 
must understand the energy changes that accompany chemical reactions.
The study of energy and its transformati
