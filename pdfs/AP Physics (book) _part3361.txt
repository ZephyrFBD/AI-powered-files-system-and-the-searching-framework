 total of seven electrons), is just the mass of a neutral nitrogen atom.
SOLUTION The total mass in the final state is
and this is equal to
which from Appendix B is a mass of 14.003074 u. So the mass difference is
which is equivalent to an energy

or 156 keV.
NOTE The neutrino doesn’t contribute to either the mass or charge balance
because it has

According to Example 30–8, we would expect the emitted electron to have a
kinetic energy of 156 keV. (The daughter nucleus, because its mass is very much
larger than that of the electron, recoils with very low velocity and hence gets very
little of the kinetic energy—see Example 30–7.) Indeed, very careful measure-
ments indicate that a few emitted 
particles do have kinetic energy close to this
calculated value. But the vast majority of emitted electrons have somewhat less
energy. In fact, the energy of the emitted electron can be anywhere from zero up
to the maximum value as calculated above. This range of electron kinetic energy
