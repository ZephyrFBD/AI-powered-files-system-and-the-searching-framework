anism is viable, such as the emergence of an appendage
from the eye of the Drosophila, are very rare. The overall
body plan is controlled in Drosophila by a cluster of genes
called the Hox genes. In the fruit fly there is a single
cluster and the arrangement of genes in the genome is a
map of the anterior to posterior body plan. In all vertebrate
multiple Hox clusters control the development of the body
plan and they too show the sequential anterior to posterior
arrangement in the genome.
D. During development the transcription factors expressed
by the Hox genes initiate and terminate the expression of
specialized cells and tissues. Describe the evidence for
shared ancestry in this conserved strategy for
communication between cells through regulation of
transcription factors.
E. Describe one other example of conserved core shared
by all domains or within one domain.
