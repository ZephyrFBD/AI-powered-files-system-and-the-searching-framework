If the four nucleons suddenly came together to form a 
nucleus, the mass

energy). The mass (or energy) difference in the case of

This difference is referred to as 
the total binding energy of the nucleus. The total binding energy represents the
amount of energy that must be put into a nucleus in order to break it apart into 
its constituents. If the mass of, say, a 
nucleus were exactly equal to the mass
of two neutrons plus two protons, the nucleus could fall apart without any input
of energy. To be stable, the mass of a nucleus must be less than that of its con-
stituent nucleons, so that energy input is needed to break it apart.
Binding energy is not something a nucleus has—it is energy
