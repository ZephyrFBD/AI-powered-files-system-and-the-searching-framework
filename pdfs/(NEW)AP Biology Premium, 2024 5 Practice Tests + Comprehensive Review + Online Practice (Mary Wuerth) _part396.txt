referred to as “jumping genes”
Practice Questions
Multiple-Choice
1. A repressible operon in bacteria codes for the genes required to produce the amino acid serine. Serine functions
as a corepressor for the operon. If serine is present in the bacteria’s environment, which of the following is most
likely?
(A) increased digestion of serine
(B) increase in the levels of serine
(C) increased production of the repressor protein
(D) increased binding of the repressor protein to the operator
2. The arabinose operon is an inducible operon that codes for the genes required to digest the sugar arabinose.
Arabinose functions as an inducer molecule for the operon. If arabinose is present in the bacteria’s environment,
which of the following is most likely?
(A) increased digestion of arabinose
(B) increase in th
