 Choice A is predicated on
sudden and extreme change. Nothing in the graph tells you about
how quickly the change happened. Choice B is not correct because it
describes stabilizing selection, whereas the graph shows directional
selection. Choice D describes a graph where one population divides
into two. (EVO-1 & SP 1)
(D) Evolutionary success is measured by reproductive success. The
organism that produces the most offspring is considered the most
successful. Choice A is not correct because the best-adapted
organism survives; that is not always the largest, fastest, or smartest
organism. Choice B is not correct because the wording implies that
the snail needed to be a certain color and so it became that color.
Organisms do not evolve because they “need” to. If they are not
adapted, they migrate or die. Choice C is not correct because
acquired traits are not inherited. (EVO-1)
(B) Monkeys have tails and are only very distantly related to apes.
The other choices are all apes and are close
