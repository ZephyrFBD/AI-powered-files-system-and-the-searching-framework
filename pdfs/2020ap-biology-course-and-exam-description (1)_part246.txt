t the beginning of each 
investigation in the AP Biology Investigative Labs: An 
Inquiry-Based Approach lab manual. Most lab manuals 
provide a list of materials and equipment needed for 
each lab investigation. Before purchasing materials, 
consult your lab manual and calculate how much of a 
substance or material may be needed for the number of 
students you have. 
Students will need access to basic lab equipment 
and glassware (e.g., beakers, graduated cylinders, and 
balances). Access to some specialized equipment, 
such as spectrophotometers, gel electrophoresis 
equipment and pH meters, may be needed to complete 
some of the investigations in the lab manual. None of 
the investigations in the lab manual require the use 
of probes or computer sensors for data collection, 
though they can be used if available. It is recommended 
that instructors have a computer and projector to 
show computer-based animations and simulations for 
pre-lab activities or post-lab discussions. However,
