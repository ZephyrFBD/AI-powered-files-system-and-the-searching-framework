ue to the presence of malaria, the heterozygous
genotype (Ss) would be the most advantageous because individuals with that genotype would not have
sickle cell disease but would also be resistant to malaria.
12. (a) The probability of producing a hamster offspring with yellow fur would be .
(b) As shown in the following Punnett square, both parents must be heterozygous, so the possible genotypes are
YY, Yy, or yy. However, since YY is always fatal as per the information stated in the question, there are only
two possible outcomes for live offspring: Yy or yy. So  would be heterozygous for yellow fur, and  would
have white fur.
(c) The frequency of the yellow allele would probably decrease over time.
(d) Hamsters with white fur color would be better able to blend in with the white sand environment and more
likely to hide from potential predators than hamsters with yellow fur. Thus, the frequency of the yellow
allele would likely decrease over time.
