Voltaic Cells (Section 20.3)
 20.27  Indicate whether each statement is true or false: (a) The 
cathode is the electrode at which oxidation takes place. 
 
(b) A galvanic cell is another name for a voltaic cell. 
 
(c) Electrons flow spontaneously from anode to cathode in 
a voltaic cell.
 20.28  Indicate whether each statement is true or false: (a) The 
anode is the electrode at which oxidation takes place. 
(b) A voltaic cell always has a positive emf. (c) A salt bridge 
or permeable barrier is necessary to allow a voltaic cell to 
operate.
 20.29  A voltaic cell similar to that shown in Figure 20.5 is con-
structed. One electrode half-cell consists of a silver strip 
placed in a solution of AgNO3, and the other has an iron 
strip placed in a solution of FeCl2. The overall cell reac-
tion is
Fe1s2 + 2 Ag+1aq2 ยก Fe2+1aq2 + 2 Ag1s2
