The car just begins to budge with the rope at
an angle , which she estimates to be 5°. With what force 
is the rope pulling on the car? Neglect the mass of the rope.
(b) What is the “mechanical advantage” of this technique
[Section 4–7]? (c) At what angle 
would this technique
become counterproductive? [Hint: Consider the forces on
a small segment of rope where 
acts, Fig. 4–78b.]

2. (a) Show that the minimum stopping distance for an automo-
bile traveling on a level road at speed v is equal to 
where 
is the coefficient of static friction between the tires
and the road, and g is the acceleration of gravity. (b) What
is this distance for a 1200-kg car traveling 
if
(c) What would it be if the car were on the
Moon (the acceleration of gravity on the Moon is about 
g 6) but all else stayed the same?
3. In the equation for static friction in Section 4–8, what is
the significance of the
sign? When should you use the
equals sign in the static friction equation?
