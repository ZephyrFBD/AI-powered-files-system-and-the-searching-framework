88. A space vehicle returning from the Moon enters the Earth’s
atmosphere at a speed of about 
Molecules
(assume nitrogen) striking the nose of the vehicle with this
speed correspond to what temperature? (Because of this
high temperature, the nose of a space vehicle must be made
of special materials; indeed, part of it does vaporize, and
this is seen as a bright blaze upon reentry.)
89. A sauna has 
of air volume, and the temperature is
85°C. The air is perfectly dry. How much water (in kg)
should be evaporated if we want to increase the relative
humidity from 0% to 10%? (See Table 13–3.)
90. A 0.50-kg trash-can lid is suspended against gravity by tennis
balls thrown vertically upward at it. How many tennis balls
per second must rebound from the lid elastically, assuming
they have a mass of 0.060 kg and are thrown at
