e blown in such a way
that only one of the overtones is resonating. The most 
popular alpenhorn is about 3.4 m long, and it is called the
(or 
) horn. What is the fundamental frequency 
of this horn, and which overtone is close to 
? (See 
Table 12–3.) Model as a tube open at both ends.

the presence of standing waves, which can cause acoustic
“dead spots” at the locations of the pressure nodes. Con-
sider a living room 4.7 m long, 3.6 m wide, and 2.8 m high.
Calculate the fundamental frequencies for the standing
waves in this room.
94. A dramatic demonstration, called “singing rods,” involves
a long, slender aluminum rod held in the hand near the
rod’s midpoint. The rod is stroked with the other hand.
With a little practice, the rod can be made to “sing,” or
emit a clear, loud, ringing sound. For an 80-cm-long rod,
(a) what is the fundamental frequency of the sound?
(b) What is its wavelength in the rod, and (c) wha
