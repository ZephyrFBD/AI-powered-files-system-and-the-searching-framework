CHAPTER 1 Introduction: Matter, Energy, and Measurement
 
Einstein’s theory of relativity represented a fundamental shift in 
how we think of space and time. He predicted where the excep-
tions to predictions based on Newton’s theory might be found. 
Although only small departures from Newton’s theory were pre-
dicted, they were observed. Einstein’s theory of relativity became 
accepted as the correct model. However, for most uses, Newton’s 
laws of motion are quite accurate enough.
The overall process we have just considered, illustrated in 
 
Figure 1.18, is often referred to as the scien
