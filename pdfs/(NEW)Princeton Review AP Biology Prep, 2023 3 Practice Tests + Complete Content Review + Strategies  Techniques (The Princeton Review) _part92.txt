This might seem like an awful lot of information, but for each topic, there are just a few key facts you’ll need to
know. Your biology textbooks may go into far greater detail about some of these topics than we do. That’s because
they’re trying to teach you “correct science,” whereas we’re aiming to improve your scores. Our science is perfectly

as you’ll soon see, our treatment of these topics is far easier to handle.
The AP Biology Exam not only tests your content knowledge, but it also tests how you apply that knowledge during
scientific inquiry. Simply put, the te
