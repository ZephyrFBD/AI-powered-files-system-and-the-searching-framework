lectric heater. An electric heater draws a steady 15.0 A
on a 120-V line. How much power does it require and how much does it cost per
month (30 days) if it operates 3.0 h per day and the electric company charges
9.2 cents per kWh?
APPROACH We use Eq. 18–5,
to find the power. We multiply the
power (in kW) by the time (h) used in a month and by the cost per energy unit,
$0.092 per kWh, to get the cost per month.
SOLUTION The power is
The time (in hours) the heater is used per month is 
which at 
would cost
just for
this heater.
NOTE Household current is actually alternating (ac), but our solution is still
valid assuming the given values for V and I are the proper averages (rms) as we
discuss in Section 18–7.
(1.80 kW)(90 h)($0.092kWh) = $15,
9.2¢kWh
= 90 h,
(3.0 hd)(30 d)
= 1800 W = 1.80 kW.
P = IV = (15.0 A)(120 V)
P = IV,
