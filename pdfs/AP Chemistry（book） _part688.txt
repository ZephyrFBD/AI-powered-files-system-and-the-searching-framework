 them toward each other. In 
this case Eel is negative, and the potential energy increases (becomes less negative) as 
the particles move apart.
To understand the relationship between electrostatic potential energy and the 
energy stored in chemical bonds, it is instructive to consider an ionic compound like 
NaCl. The Na+ cations and Cl- anions are held together by the electrostatic attraction 
between the oppositely charged ions. In chemistry we refer to this force as ionic bond-
ing. Weâ€™ll go into the details of ionic bonding in Chapter 8, but for now it is sufficient to 
understand that the ionic bonds that hold sodium and chloride ions together are based 
on the electrostatic attraction between cations and anions. To separate the ions, we must 
overcome, or break, the ionic bonds between Na+ and Cl-, increasing the potential energy, 
as illustrated in Figure 5.3. The energy to do this must come from some other source. The 
reverse process where ions separated by a large distance a
