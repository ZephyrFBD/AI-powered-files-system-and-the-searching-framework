controls the color of the pigments in the eye and has two alleles: a
dominant allele (P), which results in pink eyes, and a recessive allele
(p), which results in yellow eye color. A sex-linked gene controls
the expression of the colored pigments and also has two alleles: a
dominant allele (C), which allows for the expression of the colored
pigments, and a recessive allele (c), which does not allow for the
expression of the colored pigments. Individuals without a C allele
have white eyes regardless of the alleles of other eye-color genes.
