Ecology is the study of the interactions among living organisms and with their environment. This includes relationships
between organisms of the same species and also between different species. One core goal of ecology is to understand the

research also applies aspects of chemistry and physics, and it frequently uses mathematical models.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A learning objective merges requ
