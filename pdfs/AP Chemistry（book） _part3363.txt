to the shell structure for 
electrons in atoms. Just as certain numbers of electrons correspond to stable filled-shell 
electron configurations, so too do certain numbers (known as magic numbers) of nucle-
ons represent filled shells in nuclei.
There are several examples of the stability of nuclei with magic numbers of nucle-
ons. For example, the radioactive series in Figure 21.2 ends with the stable 206
82Pb nucleus, 
which has a magic number of protons (82). Another example is the observation that tin, 
which has a magic number of protons (50), has ten stable isotopes, more than any other 
element.
Evidence also suggests that pairs of protons and pairs of neutrons have a special sta-
bility, analogous to the pairs of electrons in molecules. This evidence accounts for the
