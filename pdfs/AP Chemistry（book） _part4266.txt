of absorption of pollutant oxides, notably SO3, produced by 
human activities. (Section 18.2)
actinide element Element in which the 5f orbitals are only 
partially occupied. (Section 6.8)
activated complex (transition state) The particular arrangement 
of atoms found at the top of the potential-energy barrier as a 
reaction proceeds from reactants to products. (Section 14.5)
activation energy (Ea) The minimum energy needed for 
reaction; the height of the energy barrier to formation of 
products. (Section 14.5)
active site Specific site on a heterogeneous catalyst or an 
enzyme where catalysis occurs. (Section 14.7)

expressed as the number of disintegrations per unit time.
