vert the vials so that the culture vial is on the top and the 
empty vial is on the bottom, and tap the flies into the empty container by tapping it on 
a solid surface several times. Be sure to hold the vials tightly to keep them together. You 
must then separate the vials and cap each separately. Do not try to isolate every fly from 
the original culture. It is difficult to separate flies, and you may lose a fly or two in the 
process. 
Step 3 After your lab group has the flies in a vial without food, observe the position of the 
flies in your upright vial. 
Step 4 Invert the vial, and observe the position of the flies after 15 seconds and after 30 
seconds.
