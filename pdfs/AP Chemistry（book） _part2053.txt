es in water decreases with increasing tem-
perature (Figure 13.16). If a glass of cold tap water is warmed, you can see bubbles on the 
inside of the glass because some of the dissolved air comes out of solution.
Similarly, as carbonated beverages are allowed to warm, the solubility of CO2 
decreases, and CO21g2 escapes from the solution.
