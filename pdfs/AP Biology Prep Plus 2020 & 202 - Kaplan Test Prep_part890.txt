ion in the trpR gene might have on gene
regulation. (1 point)
Prediction (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
A mutation in the trpR gene could lead to a nonfunctional repressor protein, so
the trp operon would always be expressed and tryptophan would build up in the
cell.
(d) Explain the feedback mechanism used by the trp operon. (1 point)
Explanation (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
In negative feedback, the output of the system inhibits the system; whereas in
positive feedback, the output of the system amplifies the system. Since when
A mutation in the trpR gene could lead to a nonfunctional repressor protein (trp operon always
on), or 
A mutation in the trpR gene could lead to an always active repressor protein (trp operon always
oﬀ), or 
A mutation may have no eﬀect
The trp operon is a repressible operon that uses negative feedback.
tryptophan is present, the operon is not transcribed, the trp operon is a
repres
