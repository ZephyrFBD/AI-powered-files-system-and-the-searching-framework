 eukaryotic cells.
IST-1.O.2
In prokaryotic organisms, translation of the mRNA 
molecule occurs while it is being transcribed.
IST-1.O.3
Translation involves energy and many 
sequential steps, including initiation, elongation, 
and termination.
X   
EXCLUSION STATEMENT—The details and 
names of the enzymes and factors involved in each 
of these steps are beyond the scope of the course 
and the AP Exam.
IST-1.O.4
The salient features of translation include—
a. Translation is initiated when the rRNA in the 
ribosome interacts with the mRNA at the start 
codon.
b.	The sequence of nucleotides on the mRNA is 
read in triplets called codons.
