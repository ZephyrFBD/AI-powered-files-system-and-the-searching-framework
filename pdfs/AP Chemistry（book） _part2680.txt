H3COO- (the common 
ion) is the initial concentration that is due to CH3COONa 
(0.30 M) plus the change in concentration (x) that is due to the 
ionization of CH3COOH.
Ka = 1.8 * 10-5 =
3H+43CH3COO-4
3CH3COOH4
The dissociation constant for CH3COOH at 25 Â°C is from Table 
16.2, or Appendix D; addition of CH3COONa does not change 
the value of this constant. Substituting the equilibrium-constant 
concentrations from our table into the equilibrium expression 
gives:
Ka = 1.8 * 10-5 =
x10.30 + x2
0.30 - x
Because Ka is small, we assume that x is small compared to the 
original concentrations of CH3COOH and CH3COO- (0.30 M 
each). Thus, we can ignore the very small x relative to 0.30 M, 
giving:
 Ka = 1.8 * 10-5 =
x10.302
0.30
The resulting value of x is indeed small relative to 0.30, justify-
ing the approximation made in simplifying the problem.
 x = 1.8 * 10-5 M = 3H+4
Finally, we calculate the pH from the equilibrium concentra-
tion of H+1aq2:
pH = -log11.8 * 10-52 = 4.74
