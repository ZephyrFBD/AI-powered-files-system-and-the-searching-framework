 the prick, the dick, the langer. So your 
 
 father shoves his excitement into your mother and there’s a spurt and 
 
 these little germs go up into your mother where there’s an egg and that 
 
 grows into you. 
 
 I’m not an egg. 
 
 You are an egg. Everyone was an egg once. 
 
 Why am I doomed? ’Tisn’t my fault I’m a bastard. 
 
 All bastards are doomed.They’re like babies that weren’t baptized. 
 
 They’re sent to Limbo for eternity and there’s no way out and it’s not 
 
 their fault. It makes you wonder about God up there on His throne 
 
 with no mercy for the little unbaptized babies. That’s why I don’t go 
 
 near the chapel anymore. Anyway, you’re doomed. Your father and 
 
 mother had the excitement and they weren’t married so you’re not in 
 
 a state of grace. 
 
 What am I going to do?

 Nothing.You’re doomed. 
 
 Can’t I light a candle or something. 
 
 You could try the Blessed Virgin. She’s in charge of the doom. 
 
 But I don’t have a penny for the candle.
