cell. Recall that this is a similar destruction mechanism to that used by NK cells. In this process, the CTL does not become
infected and is not harmed by the secretion of perforin and granzymes. In fact, the functions of NK cells and CTLs are
complementary and maximize the removal of infected cells, as illustrated in Figure 33.14. If the NK cell cannot identify
the “missing self” pattern of down-regulated MHC I molecules, then the CTL can identify it by the complex of MHC I
with foreign antigens, which signals “altered self.” Similarly, if the CTL cannot detect antigen-embedded MHC I because
the receptors are depleted from the cell surface, NK cells will destroy the cell instead. CTLs also emit cytokines, such as
interferons, that alter surface protein expression in other infected cells, such that the infected cells can be easily identified
and destroyed. Moreover, these interferons can also prevent virally infected cells from releasing virus particles.
