 ‘C22-Import’, 
‘C23-Export’, ‘C24-Poverty rate’, ‘C31-Geography’, ‘C32-Resource and Energy’, 
and ‘ C33-Environment’. Finally, we set the alternatives layer as ‘D11-Policy 
Evaluation’ and ‘D12-National Assessment’. 
 
 
 
For the first criteria layer, we compare every two elements by relative scale and 
gain the importance of BI  to A . We define matrix 
(s )

S =

for the relative importance, we usually set the parameter

inconsistent pairwise comparison matrix S , we use the unit eigenvector

i
u  stands for the weight it has on the 
target layer A . In addition, we need to test the consistency of matrix S . If it fails, we 
need to revise the matrix S. For the secondary criteria layer, we use the same method 
and gain the inconsistent pairwise comparison matrixs
