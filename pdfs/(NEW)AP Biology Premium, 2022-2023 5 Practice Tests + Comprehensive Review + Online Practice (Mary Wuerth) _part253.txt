Overview
The cell cycle is important in the growth, repair, and reproduction of cells in living organisms. Controlling the rate
of the cell cycle ensures that these processes occur in a timely manner while also preventing the development of
uncontrolled cell growth or tumors. This chapter will review the phases of the cell cycle and the factors that control
the rate of the cell cycle.
Phases of the Cell Cycle
Figure 11.1 shows the phases of the cell cycle: interphase (G1, S, and G2), mitosis (also known as the M phase),
and cytokinesis. Nondividing cells will leave the cell cycle and enter a stage called G0.

Interphase
Interphase is the longest phase of the cell cycle. During interphase, the cell grows so that it has enough material to
divide between
