Human Reproductive Anatomy
The reproductive tissues of male and female humans develop similarly in utero until a low level of the hormone testosterone
is released from male gonads. Testosterone causes the undeveloped tissues to differentiate into male sexual organs. When
testosterone is absent, the tissue
