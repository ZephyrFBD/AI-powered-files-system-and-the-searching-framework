Photovoltaic solar cells convert the light from the Sun into usable elec-
tricity, and the development of more efficient solar cells is one way to 
address Earth’s future energy needs.
How does solar energy conversion work? Fundamentally, we 
need to be able to use photons from the Sun, especially from the 
visible portion of the spectrum, to excite electrons in molecules 
and materials to different energy levels. The brilliant colors around 
you—those of your clothes, the photographs in this book, the 
foods you eat—are due to the selective absorption of visible light 
by chemicals. It is helpful to think of this process in the context of 
molecular orbital theory: Light excites an electron from a filled mo-
lecular orbital to an empty one at higher energy. Because MOs have 
definite energies, only light of the proper wavelengths can excite 
electrons.
In discussing light absorption by molecules, we can focus on 
the two MOs shown in Figure 9.47. The highest occupied molecu-
