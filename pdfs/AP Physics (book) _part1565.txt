stance changes phase. The heat of fusion is the
heat required to melt 1 kg of a solid into the liquid phase; it is
also equal to the heat given off when the substance changes from
liquid to solid. The heat of vaporization is the energy required
to change 1 kg of a substance from the liquid to the vapor phase;
it is also the energy given off when the substance changes from
vapor to liquid.
Heat is transferred from one place (or object) to another
in three different ways: conduction, convection, and radiation.
In conduction, energy is transferred through a substance by
means of collisions between hotter (faster) molecules or electrons
with their slower moving neighbors.
Convection is the transfer of energy by the mass movement
of molecules even over considerable distances.
Radiation, which does not require the presence of matter,
is energy transfer by electromagnetic waves, such as from the
Sun. All objects radiate energy in an amount that is propor-
tional to the fourth power of their K
