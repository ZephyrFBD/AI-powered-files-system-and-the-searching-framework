lakes
primarily by boats and water birds. It reached midwestern states
between the 1950s and 1980s. In nutrient-rich lakes, it can form
thick, underwater strands of tangled stems and vast mats of
vegetation at the water’s surface. In shallow areas, the plant can
interfere with water recreation such as boating, fishing, and
swimming. The plant’s floating canopy can also crowd out
important native water plants. A key factor in the plant’s success is
its ability to reproduce through stem fragmentation and runners. A
single segment of stem and leaves can take root and form a new
colony. Fragments clinging to boats and trailers can spread the plant
from lake to lake. The mechanical clearing of aquatic plants for
beaches, docks, and landings creates thousands of new stem
fragments and new plants.
