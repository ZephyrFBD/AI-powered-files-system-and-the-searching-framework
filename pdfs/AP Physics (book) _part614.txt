 the principle of conservation of mechanical energy for conservative forces.
In the next Section we shall see the great usefulness of the conservation of
mechanical energy principle in a variety of situations, and how it is often easier to
use than the kinematic equations or Newton’s laws. After that we will discuss
how other forms of energy can be included in the general conservation of energy
law, such as energy associated with friction.

Roller-coaster car speed using energy conservation.
Assuming the height of the hill in Fig. 6–18 is 40 m, and the roller-coaster car
starts from rest at the top, calculate (a) the speed of the roller-coaster car at 
the bottom of the hill, and (b) at what height it will have half this speed. Take
at the bottom of the hill.
APPROACH We use conservation of mechanical energy. We choose point 1 to
be where the car starts from rest  
at the top of the hill  
In
part (a), point 2 is the bottom of the hill, which we choose as our refere
