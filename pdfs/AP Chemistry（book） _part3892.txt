ries the information stored by DNA out of 
the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm, where the information is used in pro-
tein synthesis.
The monomers of nucleic acids, called nucleotides, are formed from 
a five-carbon sugar, a nitrogen-containing organic base, and a phosphate 
group. An example is shown in Figure 24.25.

▲ Figure 24.24 Structure of a phospholipid and a cell membrane. Living cells are encased in  
membranes typically made of phospholipid bilayers. The bilayer structure is stabilized by the  
favorable interactions of the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipids, which point away from both  
the water inside the cell and the water outside the cell, while the charged head groups face the  
two water environm
