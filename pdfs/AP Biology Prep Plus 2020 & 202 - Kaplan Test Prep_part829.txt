stone species because they
contribute to the survival of several plant species through pollination.
Plants provide shelter for insects, which are food for other species.
Plants not only provide habitats for a variety of species, they also provide
food. Plants, or producers, convert energy from the environment into
organic compounds, which begins the energy flow through organisms
living in ecosystems. Energy is required for a stable ecosystem and,
without producers, ecosystems would have no basis of energy flow.
Abiotic factors including climate (temperature, humidity, day length,
rainfall) and physical conditions (pH, water, ions) aï¬€ect the amount of
environmental stress on an ecosystem and, in turn, the stability of the
ecosystem. Abiotic factors that increase environmental stress decrease
ecosystem stability, whereas abiotic factors that decrease environmental
stress increase ecosystem stability.
