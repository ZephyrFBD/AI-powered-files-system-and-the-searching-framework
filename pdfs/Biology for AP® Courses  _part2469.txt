nce suggest that bacteria (members of the domain Bacteria) diverged from common
ancestral species between 2.5 and 3.2 billion years ago, whereas archaea diverged earlier: between 3.1
and 4.1 billion years ago. Eukarya later diverged off the Archaean line. Stromatolites are some of the oldest
fossilized organisms on Earth at around 3.5 million years ago. There is evidence that these prokaryotes
were also some of the first photosynthesizes on Earth. In fact, bacterial prokaryotes were likely responsible
for the first accumulation of oxygen in our atmosphere through photosynthesis. The group Terrabacteria
possessed many adaptations for living on land, such as resistance to drying. Some of these adaptations
were also related to photosynthesis, such as compounds that protect cells from excess light. These early
prokaryotic pathways related to photosynthesis were the foundation for photosynthesis in eukaryotic cells.
This is evidenced by the similarity in structure and function between some
