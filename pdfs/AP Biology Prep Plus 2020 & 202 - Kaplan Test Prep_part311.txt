o little to no insulin is produced. As a result, the eﬀect is
deleterious as sugar accumulates to toxic levels in the blood. In type II
diabetes, cells are unable to respond to insulin, resulting in insulin
resistance as well as toxic sugar levels in the blood. Some drugs such as
antihistamines are prophylactic. Used to prevent and treat allergies,
antihistamines inhibit the action of histamine (a compound released in
allergic reactions) by suppressing the expression of histamine receptors
in nasal mucosa.
Cell-to-Cell Communication
CELL COMMUNICATION OVER DISTANCE
Although some signaling molecules may act far away from the cell that
secreted them, many bind only to receptors on cells in the immediate
vicinity. Paracrine signaling refers to the process of signaling only nearby
cells, with signaling molecules quickly pulled out of the extracellular
matrix. Synaptic signaling occurs between a nerve cell and either
another nerve cell, a gland cell, or a muscle cell. Synaptic signaling its
