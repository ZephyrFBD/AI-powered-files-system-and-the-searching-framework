atedness is shown on a phylogenetic tree by how far back you have to go to reach the common ancestor of
the two species (shown by a branch node). Since the recent species are on the right, traveling to the left goes
back in time. Because you have to go to the oldest common ancestor to connect B. musculus and B. brydei,
they are the least closely related. Even though they are near each other on the tree, clades can rotate around a
node so this does not matter.
57. D
Because molecular biology demonstrates where the actual mutations occurred (rather than just what phenotype
is observed), it is the most reliable; it allows you to detect changes that are not phenotypically observable.
58. D
Because the brain is destroyed, it is not associated with the movement of the leg. Choice (A) is incorrect, as
reflex actions are automatic. Choices (B) and (C) can also be eliminated; both of these statements are true but
are not supported by the experiment.
59. C
The DNA template strand is complementar
