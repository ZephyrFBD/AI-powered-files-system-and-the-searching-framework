hyll b, they 
evolved before green algae and flowering plants did.
(B) Because green algae and flowering plants contain chloroplasts, they evolved 
more recently than brown algae, red algae, and cyanobacteria did.
(C) Because increasingly complex forms of chlorophyll are found in red algae, 
brown algae, green algae, and flowering plants, respectively, this reflects the 
order of their appearance.
(D) Because all of the organisms contain chlorophyll a, the organisms share a 
common ancestor.
10. A student used a microscope to observe a wet-mount slide of red onion 
epidermal cells that were suspended in a 1% NaCl solution. The student 
then added a 15% NaCL  solution to the slide and observed the changes that 
occurred. The student’s observations are represented in Figure 1.
