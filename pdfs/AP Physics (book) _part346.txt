, a hammer pushes on a nail, a magnet attracts a
paper clip. In each of these examples, a force is exerted on one object, and that
force is exerted by another object. For example, the force exerted on the nail is
exerted by the hammer.
But Newton realized that things are not so one-sided. True, the hammer exerts
a force on the nail (Fig. 4–7). But the nail evidently exerts a force back on the
hammer as well, for the hammer’s speed is rapidly reduced to zero upon contact.
Only a strong force could cause such a rapid deceleration of the hammer. Thus,
said Newton, the two objects must be treated on an equal basis. The hammer
exerts a force on the nail, and the nail exerts a force back on the hammer. This 
is the essence of Newton’s third law of motion:
Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object
exerts an equal force in the opposite direction on the first.
This law is sometimes paraphrased as “to every action there is an equal and oppo-
site reaction.” This is
