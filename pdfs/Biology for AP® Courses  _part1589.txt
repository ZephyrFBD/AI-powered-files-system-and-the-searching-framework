on of
defective proteins. The DNA mutation, if not
corrected, is permanent. Production of defective
protein ceases when the DNA strand
deteriorates.
d.
Only mRNA will result in the production of
defective proteins. The mRNA mutation will
only affect proteins made from that mRNA
strand. Production of defective protein ceases
when the mRNA strand deteriorates.
52. Discuss the effects of point mutations on a DNA
strand.

a.
Mutations can cause a single change in an amino
acid. A nonsense mutation can stop the
replication or reading of that strand. Insertion or
deletion mutations can cause a frame shift. This
can result in non-functional proteins.
b.
Mutations can cause a single change in amino
acid. A missense mutation can stop the
replication or reading of that strand. Insertion or
deletion mutations can cause a frame shift. This
can result in non-functional proteins.
c.
Mutations can cause a single change in amino
acid. A nonsense mutation can
