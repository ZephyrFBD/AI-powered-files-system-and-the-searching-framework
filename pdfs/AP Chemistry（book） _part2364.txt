nciple Use Le 
Chatelier’s principle to make qualitative 
predictions of how a system at equilibrium 
will respond to changes in concentration, 
volume, pressure, and temperature.
WHAT’s AHEAd
◀ A LEAKY BOAT. A state of dynamic equilibrium, where the water level 
reaches a constant level, is eventually attained by bailing water from a 
small boat that has sprung a leak.
A complex system of pumps is used to remove the rainwater, protecting residents and 
properties from flooding. In 2005 when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, the 
storm surge and failures in the levee system upset this equilibrium with disastrous conse-
quences for the city.
Over the past few chapters we’ve encountered several examples of dynamic equilib-
rium involving physical changes of matter, including vapor pressure 
 (Section 11.5), 
 
the formation of saturated solutions 
 (Section 13.2), and Henry’s law 
 (Sec-
tion 13.3).  Consider vapor pressure as an illustrative example. In a closed container, 
the pres
