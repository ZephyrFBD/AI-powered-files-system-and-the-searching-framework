absorption spectrum of a red plant; Graph B
plots an absorption spectrum of a green plant.
The chlorophyll from Graph A cannot carry out the light-
dependent reactions, but the chlorophyll from Graph B can.
The data from Graph A characterize several photosynthetic
pigments that reflect almost no light; the data from Graph B
characterize chlorophyll a, which reflects only green light.
Graph A shows an absorption spectrum for an unusual type of
chlorophyll a.

Cystic fibrosis is the most common inherited disease in the U.S. among
people of European descent. Four percent are carriers of the recessive
cystic fibrosis allele. The most common mutation in individuals with
cystic fibrosis is a mutation in the CFTR protein that functions in the
transport of chloride ions between certain cells and extracellular fluid.
These chloride transport channels are defective or absent in the plasma
membranes of people with the disorder. The result is an abnormally high
concentration o
