2.9 Semi-Log Model 
2.9.1 Semi-Log Model 
In a semi-logarithmic graph, one axis has a logarithmic scale and other axis has a linear 
scale. 
 
When the relationship is modelled by an equation of the form y= abx, where n is unknown. 
 
Take the logarithms of both sides of the equation; 
 
Simplify the right-hand side using the law of logarithms to give log y = log a + x log b; 
 
The gradient is log b, and we can plot the graph of log y to x. 
 
Example 1 
You are told that x and y are related by the formula y= kbx, the measured values of x and y 
are given. 
 
Estimate the values of k and b and hence suggest an equation to model the relationship 
between x and y.
