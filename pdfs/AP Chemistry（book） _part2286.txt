ss may occur, for example, by the 
withdrawal or donation of electron density from a particular bond or group of atoms in 
the enzymeâ€™s active site. In addition, the substrate may become distorted in the process 
of fitting into the active site and made more reactive. Once the reaction occurs, the prod-
ucts depart from the active site, allowing another substrate molecule to enter.
The activity of an enzyme is destroyed if some molecule other than the substrate 
specific to that enzyme binds to the active site and blocks entry of the substrate. Such 
substances are called enzyme inhibitors. Nerve poisons and certain toxic metal ions, such 
as lead and mercury, are believed to act in this way to inhibit enzyme activity. Some 
other poisons act by attaching elsewhere on the enzyme, thereby distorting the active 
site so that the substrate no longer fits.
Enzymes are enormously more efficient than nonbiochemical catalysts. The num-
