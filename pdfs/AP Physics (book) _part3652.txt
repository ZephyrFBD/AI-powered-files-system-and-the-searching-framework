ergies of the stored protons from
150 GeV to 1.0 TeV. The acceleration was done once per turn.
Estimate the energy given to the protons on each turn.
(You can assume that the speed of the protons is essentially
c the whole time.)
10. (II) A cyclotron with a radius of 1.0 m is to accelerate
deuterons 
to an energy of 12 MeV. (a) What is the
required magnetic field? (b) What frequency is needed for
the voltage between the dees? (c) If the potential difference
between the dees averages 22 kV, how many revolutions
will the particles make before exiting? (d) How much time
does it take for one deuteron to go from start to exit?
(e) Estimate how far it travels during this time.
11. (III) Show that the energy of a particle (charge e) in a
synchrotron, in the relativistic limit 
is given by
where B is the magnetic field and r is the
radius of the orbit (SI units).
