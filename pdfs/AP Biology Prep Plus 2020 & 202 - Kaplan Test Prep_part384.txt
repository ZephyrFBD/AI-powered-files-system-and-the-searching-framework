because, although noncompetitive inhibition
reduces Vmax, it does not change Km. (C) is incorrect because, though
noncompetitive inhibition has a lower Vmax than competitive
inhibition, competitive inhibition has a higher Km. (D) is incorrect
because, in competitive inhibition, a large amount of substrate is
needed to outcompete the inhibitor and saturate the enzyme.
