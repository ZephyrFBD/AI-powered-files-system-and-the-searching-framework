 
removed). However, the lower temperature also means that 
the reaction rate decreases, so the NO formed at 2400 K is es-
sentially “trapped” in that form as the gas cools.
The gases exhausting from the cylinder are still quite 
hot, perhaps 1200 K. At this temperature, as shown in Fig-
ure 15.17, the equilibrium constant for formation of NO is 
about 5 * 10-4, much smaller than the value at 2400 K. How-
ever, the rate of conversion of NO to N2 and O2 is too slow to 
permit much loss of NO before the gases are cooled further.
As discussed in the “Chemistry Put to Work” box in Sec-
tion 14.7, one of the goals of automotive catalytic convert-
ers is to achieve rapid conversion of NO to N2 and O2 at the
