All cells carry out cellular respiration in mitochondria.
The surface-to-volume ratio of all cells is the same.
Refer to the codon table below for this question.
Here is a small stretch of mRNA that would be translated at the
ribosome:
… A U G  C U G  A A A  U C A G G G …
Suppose a spontaneous mutation altered the boldface A and changed
it to a U. What effect, if any, would this have on the protein formed?
Because of redundancy in the code, there would be no change
in the protein formed.
The amino acid sequence formed from this stretch of DNA
would be Met–Leu–Lys–Ser–Gly.

The polypeptide would not form because translation would stop
at UAA.
Translation would continue and a polypeptide would form
because AUG codes for start as well as for methionine.
