o strongly 
affected by cross-linking, in which short chains of atoms connect the 
long polymer chains. Rubber is cross-linked by short chains of sulfur 
atoms in a process called vulcanization.
NANOMATERIALS (SECTION 12.9) When one or more dimensions 
of a material become sufficiently small, generally smaller than 100 
nm, the properties of the material change. Materials with dimensions 
on this length scale are called nanomaterials. Quantum dots are semi-
conductor particles with diameters of 1–10 nm. In this size range the 
material’s band gap energy becomes size-dependent. Metal nanopar-
ticles have different chemical and physical properties in the 1–100-
nm size range. Nanoparticles of gold, for example, are more reactive 
than bulk gold and no longer have a golden color. Nanoscience has 
produced a number of previously unknown forms of sp2@hybridized 
carbon. Fullerenes, like C60, are large molecules containing only 
carbon atoms. Carbon nanotubes are sheets of graphite rolled up
