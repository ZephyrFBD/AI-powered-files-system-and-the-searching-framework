this field would feel a force in the opposite direction and would thus move
counterclockwise.

Electron’s path in a uniform magnetic field. An electron
travels at
in a plane perpendicular to a uniform 0.010-T magnetic
field. Describe its path quantitatively. Ignore gravity (
very small in 
comparison).
APPROACH The electron moves at speed 
in a curved path and so must have
a centripetal acceleration
(Eq. 5–1). We find the radius of curvature
using Newton’s second law. The force is given by Eq. 20–3 with 
SOLUTION We insert F and a into Newton’s second law:
We solve for r and find
Since 
is perpendicular to 
the magnitude of 
doesn’t change. From this
equation we see that if
then
and the curve must
be a circle as we claimed above. To get r we put in the numbers:
NOTE See Fig. 20–18. If the magnetic field B is larger, is the radius larger or
smaller?
