mination of a local lake that is not only a water source for humans but also home
to fish, insects, and birds that are also affected by the contamination.
3. Adverse natural events—such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods can change the environment
greatly and destroy habitat and organisms changing the homeostatic balance. An example is a
hurricane that floods an island and destroys the land-dwelling insects in that area. Not only is living
space for terrestrial animals gone, but food sources can be gone as well.
4. Limitation of water—All organisms need water. Those that have evolved in dry areas have
mechanisms that help them to survive despite the limitation. If water becomes limited suddenly,
organisms do not have mechanisms allowing them to maintain homeostasis in its absence.
