liquid. As this phase change occurs, the heat 
released is dissipated through cooling coils in the back of the refrigerator. Just as for a 
given substance the heat of condensation is equal in magnitude to the heat of vapor-
ization and has the opposite sign, so too the heat of deposition for a given substance is 
exothermic to the same degree that the heat of sublimation is endothermic; the heat 
of freezing is exothermic to the same degree that the heat of fusion is endothermic (see 
Figure 11.20).
Give It Some Thought
What is the name of the phase change that occurs when ice left at room 
temperature changes to liquid water? Is this change exothermic or endothermic?
Go Figure
Why does water have a higher heat of vaporization than 
diethyl ether?
