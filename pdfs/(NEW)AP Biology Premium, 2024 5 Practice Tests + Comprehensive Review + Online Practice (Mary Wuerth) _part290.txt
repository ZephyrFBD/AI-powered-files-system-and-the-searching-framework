hereas meiosis produces gametes. Choice (A) is incorrect because
mitosis produces two cells whereas meiosis produces four cells. Mitosis produces genetically identical cells,
whereas meiosis produces genetically different cells, so choice (B) is incorrect. Haploid gametes are produced
by meiosis, whereas diploid cells are produced by mitosis. So choice (D) is incorrect.
8. (C) Pairs of homologous chromosomes separate during anaphase I and ultimately end up in different cells at the
end of telophase I. If a pair of homologous chromosomes did not separate in anaphase I, one of the two cells at
the end of telophase I would have both members of the pair of homologous chromosomes and the other cell
would have neither member of the pair of homologous chromosomes. The resulting gametes would have an
incorrect number of chromosomes (either one too many or one too few), which results in an aneuploidy.
Choices (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because chromosomes do not separate in those stages, s
