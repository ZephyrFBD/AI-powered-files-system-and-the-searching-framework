saline solution on the slide next to the cover slip. Next, I would
place a piece of paper towel on the opposite side of the cover
slip to draw the salt water across the elodea. Then, I would
observe changes to the elodea cells. Since water diffuses from a
higher concentration of water to a lower concentration of water,

it will diffuse out of the cell, toward the saline, leaving the cell
shrunken. When the cell shrinks, the plasma membrane will
collapse and become visible, surrounding the cluster of
chloroplasts.
Refer to the following figure:
The cell collapsed as water flowed out of the plant cell toward
the hypertonic solution. The cell membrane became visible,
surrounding the cell “innards.” The cell membrane had not
previously been visible in the healthy cell because it was
pushed up against the cell wall, and it could not be seen as a
separate entity.
Whereas a diploid cell has two homologues for each
chromosome, a
