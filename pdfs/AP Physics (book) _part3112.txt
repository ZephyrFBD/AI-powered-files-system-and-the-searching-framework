CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
The uncertainty principle states that
(a) no measurement can be perfect because it is technologically impossible to
make perfect measuring instruments.
(b) it is impossible to measure exactly where a particle is, unless it is at rest.
(c) it is impossible to simultaneously know both the position and the momen-
tum of a particle with complete certainty.
(d) a particle cannot actually have a completely certain value of momentum.
B
ohr’s model of the atom gave us a first (though rough) picture of what an
atom is like. It proposed
