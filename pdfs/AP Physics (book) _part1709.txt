f the heat of combustion of coal is 
at what rate must coal be burned if the plant is to put out
950 MW of power? Assume the efficiency of the engines is
65% of the ideal (Carnot) efficiency. (b) Water is used to
cool the power plant. If the water temperature is allowed to
increase by no more than 4.5 C°, estimate how much water
must pass through the plant per hour.
75. Suppose a heat pump has a stationary bicycle attachment
that allows you to provide the work instead of using an
electrical wall outlet. If your heat pump has a coefficient
of performance of 2.0 and you can cycle at a racing pace
(Table 15–2) for a half hour, how much heat can you
provide?

76. An ideal air conditioner keeps the temperature inside a room
at 21°C when the outside temperature is 32°C. If 4.8 kW 
of power enters a room through the windows in the form of
direct radiation from the Sun, how much electrical power
would be saved if the windows were shaded so only 500 W
enters?
