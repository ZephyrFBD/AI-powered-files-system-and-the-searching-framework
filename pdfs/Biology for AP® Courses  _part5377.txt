that more than 1.5 billion disposable masks will end up in
the world’s oceans every year polluting the water with tons of plastic
and endangering marine wildlife. Studies project that humans are
using 129 billion face masks each month worldwide – about three
million a minute. Most are disposable and made from plastic, non-
biodegradable microﬁbers that break down into smaller plastic
particles that become widespread in ecosystems. They are liĴering
cities, clogging sewage channels and turning up in bodies of water. I
have wriĴen in other books about the immense amounts of
microplastics from endless sources now being absorbed into the
body. Rolf Halden, director of the Arizona State University (ASU)
Biodesign Center for Environmental Health Engineering, was the
senior researcher in a 2020 study that analysed 47 human tissue
samples and found microplastics in all of them. ‘We have detected
these chemicals of plastics in every single organ that we have
investigated’, he said. I wrote in T
