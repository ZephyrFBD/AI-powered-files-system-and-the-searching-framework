hich detect the concentration of
electrolytes in the extracellular fluid. The concentration of electrolytes in the blood rises when there is water loss caused
by excessive perspiration, inadequate water intake, or low blood volume due to blood loss. An increase in blood electrolyte
levels results in a neuronal signal being sent from the osmoreceptors in hypothalamic nuclei. The pituitary gland has two
components: anterior and posterior. The anterior pituitary is composed of glandular cells that secrete protein hormones.
The posterior pituitary is an extension of the hypothalamus. It is composed largely of neurons that are continuous with the
hypothalamus.
The hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is transported to and
released from the posterior pituitary gland. The principal action of ADH is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the
kidneys. As ADH (which is also known as vasopressin) causes direct water reabsorption from the kidn
