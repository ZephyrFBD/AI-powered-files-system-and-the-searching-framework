2) is carried downward by the heavier, but colorless, 
CO2 (Figure 10.10).
When we have equal molar masses of two gases at the same pressure but different 
temperatures, the hotter gas is less dense than the cooler one, so the hotter gas rises. The 
difference between the densities of hot and cold air is responsible for the lift of hot-air 
balloons. It is also responsible for many phenomena in weather, such as the formation of 
large thunderheads during thunderstorms.

downward because it is denser than air.
Give It Some Thought
Is water vapor more or less dense than N2 under the same conditions  
of temperature and pressure?
Equation 10.10 can be rearranged to solve for the molar mass of a gas:
 
ℳ= dRT
P  
[10.11]
Thus, we can use the experimentally measured density of a gas to determine the molar 
mass of the gas molecules, as shown in Sample Exercise 10.8.
A large evacuated flask initially has a mass of 134.567 g. When the flask is filled wi
