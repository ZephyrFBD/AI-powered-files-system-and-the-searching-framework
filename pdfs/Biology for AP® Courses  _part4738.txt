xtinction. The Permian extinction dramatically altered Earth’s biodiversity makeup and the
course of evolution.
The causes of the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event are not clear and hypotheses of climate change, asteroid impact, and
volcanic eruptions have been argued. The extinction event occurred just before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea,
although recent scholarship suggests that the extinctions may have occurred more gradually throughout the Triassic.
The causes of the end-Cretaceous extinction event are the ones that are best understood. It was during this extinction event
about 65 million years ago that the dinosaurs, the dominant vertebrate group for millions of years, disappeared from the
planet (with the exception of a theropod clade that gave rise to birds). Indeed, every land animal that weighed more then
25 kg became extinct. The cause of this extinction is now understood to be the result of a cataclysmic impact of a large
meteorite, or asteroid, off the coast o
