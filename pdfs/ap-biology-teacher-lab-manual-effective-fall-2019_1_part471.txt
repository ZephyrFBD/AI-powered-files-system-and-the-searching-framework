 phases. The cyclins 
determine which processes in cell division are turned on or off and in what order by 
CDK. As each cyclin is turned on or off, CDK causes the cell to move through the stages 
in the cell cycle.

Cyclins and CDKs do not allow the cell to progress through its cycle automatically. 
There are three checkpoints a cell must pass through: the G1 checkpoint, G2 checkpoint, 
and the M-spindle checkpoint (Figure 4). At each of the checkpoints, the cell checks 
that it has completed all of the tasks needed and is ready to proceed to the next step in 
its cycle. Cells pass the G1 checkpoint when they are stimulated by appropriate external 
growth factors; for example, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates cells 
near a wound to divide so that they can repair the injury. The G2 checkpoint checks 
for
