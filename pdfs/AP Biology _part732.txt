types of phagocytes, called neutrophils and macrophages, migrate
to an infected site in response to local chemical attractants. This
response is called chemotaxis. Neutrophils engulf microbes and
die within a few days. Macrophages (“giant eaters”) extend
pseudopods and engulf huge numbers of microbes over a long
period of time. They digest the microbes with a combination of
lysozymes and two toxic forms of oxygen: superoxide anion and
nitric oxide.
A complement is a group of proteins that leads to the lysis
(bursting) of invading cells.
Interferons block against cell-to-cell viral infections.
Natural killer (NK) cells destroy virus-infected body cells (as well
as cancerous cells). They attack the cell membrane, causing it to
lyse (burst open) and die.
