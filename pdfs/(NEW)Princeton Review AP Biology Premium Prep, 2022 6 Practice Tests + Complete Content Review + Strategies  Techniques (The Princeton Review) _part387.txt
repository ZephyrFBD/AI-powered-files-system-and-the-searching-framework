e hard to think of it in this way, but genetic variation is the very foundation of evolution, as we’ll soon see.
Now that we’ve reintroduced genes, we can refine our definition of evolution. More specifically:
Evolution is the change in the gene pool of a population over time.
The Peppered Moths
Let’s look at an example. During the 1850s in England, there was a large population of peppered moths. In most
areas, exactly half of them were dark and carried alleles for dark coloring. The other half were light and carried
alleles for light coloring. This 1:1 ratio of phenotypes was observed until air pollution, due primarily to the burning
of coal, changed the environment. What happened?
Imagine two different cities: City 1 (in the south) and City 2 (in the north). Prior to the Industrial Revolution, both of
these cities had unpolluted environments. In both of these environments, dark moths and light moths lived
comfortably side by side. For simplicity’s sake, let’s say our proportions were
