At the conclusion of this lab, you should know the following:
1. The rate of a reaction is determined by measuring the accumulation of one of the products or by measuring the
disappearance of the substrate (reactant).
2. The rate of a reaction is the slope of the linear (straight) part of the graph that describes the accumulation of
product (or decrease in substrate) as time progresses.
3. Reaction rate may be affected by temperature, pH, substrate concentration, and enzyme concentration.
Part I: Determine a Baseline for Peroxidase Activity
The goal for this part of the investigation is to establish a baseline for
 
measuring the amount of H2O2that is broken down. Once a baseline is
 
established, it can serve as a comparison to subsequent reactions that you
investigate in parts II and III. You can measure the progress of the H2O2 reaction by measuring the disappearance
of H2O2or the accumulation of H2O or O2. If a reducing agent (like g
