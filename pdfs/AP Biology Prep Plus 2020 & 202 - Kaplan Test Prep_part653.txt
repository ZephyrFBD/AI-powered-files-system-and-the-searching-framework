Based on the data in the table, must cancer cells stop producing
XIST in order for an individual to have two active X chromosomes?
Yes, because all of the cell lines that are XIST negative also
have two active X chromosomes.
(A)
No, because the MCF7 cancer line is XIST positive but still has
two active X chromosomes.
(B)
No, because the HMEC line is positive for XIST expression, but
still has two active X chromosomes.
(C)
Yes, because the T47D cancer line is XIST positive but has lost
Xi.
