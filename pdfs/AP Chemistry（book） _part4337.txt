physical changes Changes in physical appearance (such 
as a phase change) that occur with no change in chemical 
composition. (Section 1.3)
physical properties Properties that can be measured without 
changing the composition of a substance, for example, color 
and freezing point. (Section 1.3)
pi 1P2 bond A covalent bond in which electron density is 
concentrated above and below the internuclear axis; produced 
by the sideways overlap of p orbitals. (Section 9.6)
pi 1P2 molecular orbital A molecular orbital that concentrates 
the electron density on opposite sides of an imaginary line that 
passes through the nuclei. (Section 9.8)
Planck constant (h) The constant that relates the energy 
and frequency of a photon, E = hn. Its value is 6.626 * 10-34 J@s. 
(Section 6.2)
plastic A polymeric solid that can be formed into particular 
shapes by application of heat and pressure. (Section 12.8)
polar covalent bond A covalent bond in which the electrons are 
not shared equally. (Section 8.4
