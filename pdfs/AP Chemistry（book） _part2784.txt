nwanted organic matter is 
oxidized by hypochlorite ions, which are added to kill bacteria. Run-
off containing chloride salts used to treat icy roads in the winter may 
have also contributed.
In the face of mounting evidence that the lead in Flintâ€™s drink-

back to water piped in from Detroit. Over a period of many months, 
the circulation of properly treated water should restore the passivat-

be in excess of $120 million and possibly much more, a large sum 
compared to the estimated $50,000 per year that it would have cost 
to treat the water with phosphates. More importantly, the damage 
done to people who drank the contaminated water, especially chil-

Although the use of lead in plumbing has been banned in the 
United States since 1986, it is estimated that millions of miles of bur-
