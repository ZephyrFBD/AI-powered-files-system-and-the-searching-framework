Ecosystem
Ecosystems are self-contained regions that include both living and nonliving factors. For example, a lake, its
surrounding forest, the atmosphere above it, and all the organisms that live in or feed off the lake would be
considered an ecosystem. Living factors are called biotic factors and nonliving factors are called abiotic factors.
Abiotic factors include water, humidity, temperature, soil/atmosphere composition, light, and radiation. As you
probably know, there is an exchange of materials between the components of an ecosystem.
On the next page, take a look at the flow of carbon through a typical ecosystem.
You’ll notice how carbon is recycled throughout the ecosystem—this is called the carbon cycle. In other words,
carbon flows through ecosystems. There are also cycles for nitrogen and water. The interactions between the biotic
and the abiotic factors are crucial for balance of the ecosystem.
