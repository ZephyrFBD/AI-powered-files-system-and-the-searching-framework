field B?
APPROACH Three straight sections of the wire loop are in the magnetic field:
a horizontal section and two vertical sections. We apply Eq. 20–1 to each sec-
tion and use the right-hand rule.
SOLUTION Using right-hand-rule-2 (page 564), we see that the magnetic force
on the left vertical section of wire points to the left, and the force on the vertical
section on the right points to the right. These two forces are equal and in
opposite directions and so add up to zero. Hence, the net magnetic force on the
loop is that on the horizontal section ab, whose length is
The 
angle between 
and the wire is
so
Thus Eq. 20–1 gives
NOTE This technique can be a precise means of determining magnetic field strength.
