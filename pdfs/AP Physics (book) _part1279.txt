 input level. By what factor
does the intensity change for a 3 dB change in output level?
APPROACH Let us call the average intensity 
and the average sound level 
Then the maximum intensity,
corresponds to a level
We
then use the relation between intensity and sound level, Eq. 12–1.
SOLUTION Equation 12–1 gives
because
as discussed in Appendix A–8. This last equa-
tion gives
or
So 
corresponds to a doubling or halving of the intensity.
NOTE From this last equation, we see also that

EXERCISE A If an increase of 3 dB means “twice as intense,” what does an increase of
6 dB mean?
It is worth noting that a sound-level difference of 3 dB (which corresponds to
a doubled intensity, as we just saw)
