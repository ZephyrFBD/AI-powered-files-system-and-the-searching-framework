13. The sequences for two short fragments of DNA are shown above. Which of the following is one way in which 
these two segments would differ? 
(A) Segment 1 would not code for mRNA because both strands have T, a base not found in RNA. 
(B) Segment 1 would be more soluble in water than segment 2 because it has more phosphate groups.
