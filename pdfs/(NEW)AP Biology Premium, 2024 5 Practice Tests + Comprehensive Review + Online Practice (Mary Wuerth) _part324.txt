loroplasts have their own DNA separate from nuclear DNA. Genes
on mitochondrial or chloroplast DNA do not follow the inheritance patterns seen in genes located on nuclear DNA.
During gamete formation, the eggs produced in animals and the ovules produced in plants are much, much larger
than the sperm (in animals) or pollen (in plants) that are produced. Since the eggs and ovules are larger, they
contribute far more mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) than the sperm or pollen do. In plants, the
ovules also contribute more chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) than the pollen do. For this reason, traits on nonnuclear
DNA in the mitochondria or chloroplast demonstrate maternal inheritance. Figure 14.3 shows a pedigree that
illustrates an example of maternal inheritance. Note that the trait can be passed from mother to either her sons or her
daughters. Males with the trait do not pass it on to their offspring.
