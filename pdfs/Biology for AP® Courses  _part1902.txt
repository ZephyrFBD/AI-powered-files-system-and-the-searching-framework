Cytochrome c oxidase is a highly conserved protein found in bacteria and in the mitochondria of eukaryotes. Based on
your knowledge of evolutionary relationships, which of the following statements would you expect to be true of the
cytochrome c oxidase protein sequence?
a.
The bacterial protein will be more similar to the human protein than the yeast protein.
b.
The yeast protein will be more similar to the human protein than the bacterial protein.
c.
The bacterial protein will be more similar to the yeast protein than the human protein.
d.
The bacterial and yeast protein will share a similar sequence, but the human protein will be unrelated.
Use of Whole-Genome Sequences of Model Organisms
The first genome to be completely sequenced was of a bacterial virus, the bacteriophage fx174 (5368 base pairs); this was
accomplished by Fred Sanger using shotgun sequencing. Several other organelle and viral genomes were later sequenced.
The first organism whose genome w
