or fourteen and our long stockings always 
 
 have holes to be darned. If she has no wool for the darning and the 
 
 stockings are dark we can blacken our ankles with shoe polish for the 
 
 respectability that’s in it. It’s a terrible thing to walk the world with skin 
 
 showing through the holes of our stockings.When we wear them week 
 
 after week the holes grow so big we have to pull the stocking forward 
 
 271 
 
 under the toes so that the hole in the back is hidden in the shoe. On 
 
 rainy days the stockings are soggy and we have to hang them before the 
 
 fire at night and hope they’ll dry by morning.Then they’re hard with 
 
 dirt cake and we’re afraid to pull them on our feet for fear they’ll fall on 
 
 the floor in bits before our eyes.We might be lucky enough to get our 
 
 stockings on but then we have to block the holes in our shoes and I 
 
 fight with my brother,Malachy, over any scrap of cardboard or paper in 
 
 the house. Michael is only six and he has to wait
