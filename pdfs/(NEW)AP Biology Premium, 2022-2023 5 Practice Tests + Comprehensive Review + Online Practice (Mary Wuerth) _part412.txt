 a DNA sample with restriction enzymes, which cut DNA at specific base pair sequences.
Due to the redundancy of the genetic code, even organisms with the same protein sequences will have slightly
different DNA sequences. Treatment of DNA with restriction enzymes will cut these different DNA sequences at
different locations and result in different fragment sizes.
The backbone of the DNA double helix consists of five-carbon deoxyribose sugars and phosphate groups. The
phosphate groups have a slight negative charge. DNA samples are loaded into wells at the top of the gel, and an
electric current is applied to the gel. A positive cathode is attached to the bottom of the gel and the negative anode to
the top of the gel. DNA molecules have an overall negative charge (due to their abundance of the phosphate groups),
causing them to migrate toward the bottom (positive end) of the gel.
The gel itself is usually made of agarose and contains microscopic pores through which the DNA fragments
migra
