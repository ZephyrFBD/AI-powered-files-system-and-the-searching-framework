lls, these four
nucleotides spell out thousands of recipes. Each recipe is called a gene. The human genome has around 20,000
genes.
The recipes of the genes are spread out among the millions of nucleotides of DNA, and all of the DNA for a species
is called its genome. Each separate chunk of DNA in a genome is called a chromosome.
Humans have 23 different chromosomes and they have two copies of each, so
each human cell has 46 linear chromosome segments in the nucleus.
Prokaryotes have one circular chromosome, and eukaryotes have linear chromosomes. In eukaryotes, the DNA is
further structured, likely since linear chromosomes are more likely to get tangled. To keep it organized, the DNA is
wrapped around proteins called histones, and then the histones are bunched together in groups called a nucleosome.
Not all DNA is wound up equally, because it must be unwound in order to be read. How tightly DNA is packaged
depends on the section of DNA and also what is going on in the cell at that tim
