As mentioned above, the central nervous system (CNS) is made up of the brain, a part of which is shown in Figure
26.19 and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called meninges (from the Greek word for
membrane). The outermost layer is the dura mater (Latin for “hard mother”). As the Latin suggests, the primary function
for this thick layer is to protect the brain and spinal cord. The dura mater also contains vein-like structures that carry blood
from the brain back to the heart. The middle layer is the web-like arachnoid mater. The last layer is the pia mater (Latin
for “soft mother”), which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap. The space between the
arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is produced by a tissue called choroid plexus in
fluid-filled compartments in the CNS called ventricles. The brain floats in CSF, which acts as a cushion an
