(a) Molar mass: Compounds (i) and (ii) have similar rodlike struc-
tures. The longer chain in (ii) leads to greater molar mass, stron-
ger London dispersion forces, and higher heat of vaporization.  
(b) Molecular shape: Compounds (iii) and (v) have the same 
chemical formula and molar mass but different molecular shapes. 
The more rodlike shape of (v) leads to more contact between mol-
ecules, stronger dispersion forces, and higher heat of vaporiza-
tion. (c) Molecular polarity: Compound (iv) has a smaller molar 
mass than (ii) but a larger heat of vaporization, which must be 
due to the presence of dipoleâ€“dipole forces. (d) Hydrogen bonding 
interactions: Molecules (v) and (vi) have similar structures. Even 
though (v) has larger molar mass and dispersion forces, hydro-
gen bonding causes (vi) to have
