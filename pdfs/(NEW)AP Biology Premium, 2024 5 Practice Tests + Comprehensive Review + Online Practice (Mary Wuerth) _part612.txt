 under white light, the second beaker is placed under green light, and the
third beaker is placed under red light. All light sources have equal light intensity and are kept at the same
temperature. The number of floating leaf disks at the end of each minute is recorded for 10 minutes and
graphed. The estimated time for 50% of the leaf disks to float (ET50) is calculated. Which color of light is
expected to produce the highest ET50 value?
(A) white light, because it contains all colors of the spectrum of visible light and chlorophyll will absorb all the
wavelengths of light in the visible light spectrum
(B) green light, because chlorophyll absorbs the most energy from wavelengths of green light
(C) red light, because chlorophyll reflects red light and does not absorb energy from wavelengths of red light
(D) green light, because chlorophyll reflects green light and does not absorb energy from wavelengths of green
light
