feed on.

Being infected with malaria causes individuals to develop
mutations that result in sickle cell disease if both copies of
the hemoglobin gene are mutated.

10. Ribozymes are RNA molecules that have enzyme-like
characteristics. They have been found to be involved in catalyzing
chemical reactions such as the synthesis of short complementary
strands of RNA. There has even been evidence of ribozymes that
are capable of self-replication, given ample amounts of nucleotide
building blocks in their environment. The existence of these
ribozymes best supports which of the following models for the
origin of life?
The deep sea vents model, because the submarine
hydrothermal vents rich in organic molecules provided the
building blocks for ribozymes to self-replicate
(A)
Oparin-Haldane’s primordial “soup” model, because the
nucleotide building blocks necessary for RNA replication
were formed as a result of Earth’s reducing at
