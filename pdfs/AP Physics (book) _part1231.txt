uency of its source? Why or why not?
12. Explain the difference between the speed of a transverse
wave traveling along a cord and the speed of a tiny piece 
of the cord.
13. What kind of waves do you think will travel along a hori-
zontal metal rod if you strike its end (a) vertically from
above and (b) horizontally parallel to its length?
14. Since the density of air decreases with an increase in tem-
perature, but the bulk modulus B is nearly independent of
temperature, how would you expect the speed of sound
waves in air to vary with temperature?
15. If a rope has a free end, a pulse sent down the rope
behaves differently on reflection than if the rope has that
end fixed in position. What is this difference, and why does
it occur?
16. How did geophysicists determine that part of the Earth’s
interior is liquid?
