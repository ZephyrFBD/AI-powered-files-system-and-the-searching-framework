composed of two elements: hydrogen and oxygen.
Figure 1.5(d) shows a mixture of substances. Mixtures 
are combinations of two or more substances in which

Elements
Currently, 118 elements are known, though they vary widely in abundance. 
 
Hydrogen constitutes about 74% of the mass in the Milky Way galaxy, and he-
lium constitutes 24%. Closer to home, only five elements—oxygen, silicon, alu-
minum, iron, and  
calcium—account for over 90% of Earth’s crust (including 
oceans and atmosphere), and only three—oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen—ac-
count for over 90% of the mass of the human body (Figure 1.6).
Table 1.1 lists some common elements, along with the chemical symbols used 
to denote them. The symbol for each element consists of one or two letters, with 
the first letter capitalized. These symbols are derived mostly from the English
