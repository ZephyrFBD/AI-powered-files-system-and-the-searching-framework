ies allow the procedure for "family balancing", based on the
desire of some parents to have at least one child of each sex. Still others, including the United States, have
taken a scattershot approach to regulating these practices, essentially leaving it to the individual practicing
physician to decide which practices are acceptable and which are not.
Even murkier are rare instances of disabled parents, such as those with deafness or dwarfism, who select
embryos via PGD to ensure that they share their disability. These parents usually cite many positive aspects
of their disabilities and associated culture as reasons for their choice, which they see as their moral right. To
others, to purposely cause a disability in a child violates the basic medical principle of Primum non nocere,
"first, do no harm." This procedure, although not illegal in most countries, demonstrates the complexity of
ethical issues associated with choosing genetic traits in offspring.
