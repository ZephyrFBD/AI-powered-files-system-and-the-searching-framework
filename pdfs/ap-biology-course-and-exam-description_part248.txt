oach, 
, a manual that 
meets the curriculum requirement for inquiry-based 
laboratory experiences for students.
Both the teacher and the student manuals are free 
and available on the College Board website. Though 
this lab manual isn’t required, it includes laboratory 
investigations that teachers can choose from to satisfy 
the guided inquiry lab component for the course. Some 
textbook publishers may provide a lab manual as an 
ancillary to the textbook, and most science classroom 
supply companies also offer lab manuals. 
Lab Notebooks and Student 
Workbooks 
Many publishers and science classroom material 
distributors offer affordable lab notebooks and student 
workbooks with associated practice problems and 
solutions. Students can use any type of notebook, even an 
online document, to fulfill the lab notebook requirement.
