ekeeping 
Safety goggles or glasses, aprons, and gloves must be worn because KOH (or the 
alternative, NaOH in Drano) is caustic. Keep the KOH solution in cotton, using a 
limited amount of KOH, inside the barrel of the syringe, and you’ll minimize accidental 
exposure to KOH. When charging the microrespirometers, point the capillary into a sink 
in case there is excess KOH that might be expelled from the capillary under pressure. 
Students must be careful when using the hot glue gun to seal microrespirometers. 
Students should be supervised at all times while working in the laboratory. 
■ ALIGNMENT TO THE AP BIOLOGY CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK 
This investigation can be conducted during the study of concepts pertaining to cellular 
processes (big idea 2) — specifically, the capture, use, and storage of free energy — or 
interactions (big idea 4). In addition, some questions students are likely to connect to 
evolution (big idea 1) if students explore cellular respiration — a conserved core p
