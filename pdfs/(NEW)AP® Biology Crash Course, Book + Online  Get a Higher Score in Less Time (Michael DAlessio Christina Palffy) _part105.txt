on size differential of DNA fragments. An electric field is passed through
DNA molecules and the molecules travel toward the positive end (cathode) due to negative charge of
phosphate on DNA.
3. Larger molecules travel slower; smaller molecules travel faster.
4. Marker DNA of a standard size is used to approximate the size of unknown molecules. Marker is
measured in kilobase pairs.
5. Visualization of DNA is done by staining the gel with ethidium bromide, which increases the visual
difference between DNA and the gel.
Electrophoresis can be used for DNA and protein identification, isolation of different types of DNA or
protein, calculating the size of fragments (DNA and protein), crime scene investigation, and genetic
testing.
C. Polymerase Chain Reaction
1. A method to take a small amount of DNA and amplify (increase) the amount.
2. Based on progressive heating and cooling of DNA strands with the addition of primers and DNA
polymerase.
D. DNA Fingerprinting
1. A technique used by foren
