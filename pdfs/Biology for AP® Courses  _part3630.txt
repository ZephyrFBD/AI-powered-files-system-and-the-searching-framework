rning items around the home can leak carbon monoxide gas. Because it is tasteless and odorless,
people might not be aware of the leak, putting them at great risk for carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon
monoxide detectors, such as the one pictured here, have saved countless lives by alerting people to a
dangerous build-up of carbon monoxide.
