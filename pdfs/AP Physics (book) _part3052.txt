a
crucial stepping stone to our present understanding. And some aspects of the
Bohr model are still useful today, so we examine it in detail in the next Section.
27–12 The Bohr Model
Bohr had studied in Rutherford’s laboratory for several months in 1912 and was
convinced that Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom had validity. But in
order to make it work, he felt that the newly developing quantum theory would
somehow have to be incorporated in it. The work of Planck and Einstein had
shown that in heated solids, the energy of oscillating electric charges must change
discontinuously—from one discrete energy state to another, with the emission of
a quantum of light. Perhaps, Bohr argued, the electrons in an atom also cannot
lose energy continuously, but must do so in quantum “jumps.” In working out his
model during the next year, Bohr postulated that electrons move about the nucleus
in circular orbits, but that only certain orbits are allowed. He further postulated
that an electron in
