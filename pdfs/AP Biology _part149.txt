ses. One important cyclin-kinase
complex is MPF, maturation promoting factor, which triggers the
cellâ€™s passage from G2 to M (metaphase).
Mitosis produces identical daughter cells. It allows organisms to
grow, replace cells, and reproduce asexually. Understand what
happens in each stage of mitosis.
Meiotic cell division produces gametes, each with the haploid
chromosome number. During meiosis I, homologous chromatids
exchange genetic material via crossing-over before they separate.
Crossing-over increases genetic diversity, which is necessary for
evolution.
Fertilization is the random fusion of gametes that further increases
genetic diversity, as well as restores the original diploid
chromosome number in the zygote (fertilized egg).
Pay attention to the differences between metaphase in mitosis and
metaphase in meiosis.
