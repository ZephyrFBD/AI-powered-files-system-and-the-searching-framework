42. How could a proteomic map of the human genome
help find a cure for cancer?
a.
A genetic map could help in identifying genes
that could counteract the cause of cancer.
b.
Metabolomics can be used to study the genes
producing metabolites during cancer.
c.
Proteomics detects biomarkers whose expression
is affected by the disease process.
d.
The mapping helps in analyzing the inheritance
of cancer-causing genes.
43. What contributions have been made through the use of
microbial genomics?
a.
Microbial genomics has provided various tools
to study the psychological behaviors of
organisms.
b.
Microbial genomics has been useful in
producing antibiotics, enzymes, improved
vaccines, disease treatments and advanced
cleanup techniques.
c.
Microbial genomics has contributed resistance in
other bacteria by horizontal and lateral gene
transfer mechanisms.
d.
