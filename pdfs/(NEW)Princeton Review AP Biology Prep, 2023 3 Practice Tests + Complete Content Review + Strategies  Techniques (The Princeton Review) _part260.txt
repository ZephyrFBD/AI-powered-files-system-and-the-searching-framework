on to locate a suitable mate, adapt metabolism rates in response to changes
in nutrient availability, or make their numbers known to other members of their species (a phenomenon known as
quorum sensing).
Taxis is the movement of an organism in response to a stimulus and can be positive (toward the stimulus) or
negative (away from the stimulus). Taxes are innate behavioral responses, or instincts. Chemotaxis is movement in
response to chemicals. For example, bacteria can control flagella rotation to direct their motion, thus avoiding
repellents (such as poisons), or helping them find favorable locations with high concentrations of attractants (such as
food). In our bodies, neutrophils use chemotaxis to respond to an infection and are the first responders to
inflammation.
Signal Transduction & Changes In Pathways
The cells of multicelled organisms must communicate with one another to coordinate the activities of the organism
as a whole. Cells communicate through cell-to-cell contact or t
