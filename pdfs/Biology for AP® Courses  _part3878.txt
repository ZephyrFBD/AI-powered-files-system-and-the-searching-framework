tic pressures experienced by
a fish. Based on the direction of water and solute
movements shown in the diagram, is this fish likely a
saltwater or freshwater fish? How do you know?
a.
freshwater, because the fish is osmoregulating in
response to a hypertonic solution
b.
freshwater, because the fish is osmoregulating in
response to a hypotonic solution
c.
saltwater, because the fish is osmoregulating in
response to a hypertonic solution
d.
saltwater, because the fish is osmoregulating in
response to a hypotonic solution

The diagram models the osmotic pressures experienced by
a fish. Why would this fish most likely drink little water
but excrete dilute urine? Explain your answer in terms of
the osmolarity of the water it lives in.
a.
The high osmolarity of the water would cause
accumulation of too many salts in the body of
the fish.
b.
The water it lives in has very low osmolarity,
which causes water to constantly diffuse into the
fishâ€™s body.
c.
The water it lives in has very high o
