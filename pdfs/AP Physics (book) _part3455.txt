is more stable than

absorbing a fast neutron and producing a fission is too low to produce a self-sustaining chain reaction.

FIGURE 31–7 If the amount of
uranium exceeds the critical mass, as
in (a), a sustained chain reaction is
possible. If the mass is less than
critical, as in (b), too many neutrons
escape before additional fissions
occur, and the chain reaction is not
sustained.
FIGURE 31–8 A nuclear reactor.
The heat generated by the fission process 
in the fuel rods is carried off by hot water 
or liquid sodium and is used to boil 
water to steam in the heat exchanger.
The steam drives a turbine to generate
electricity and is then cooled in the 
condenser (to red
