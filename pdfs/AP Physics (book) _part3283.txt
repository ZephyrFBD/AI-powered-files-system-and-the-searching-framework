 diode; only then is there a current through the
resistor R. Hence, a graph of the voltage 
across R as a function of time looks
like the output voltage shown in Fig. 29–31b. This half-wave rectification is not
exactly dc, but it is unidirectional. More useful is a full-wave rectifier circuit, which
uses two diodes (or sometimes four) as shown in Fig. 29–32a (top of next page).
At any given instant, either one diode or the other will conduct current to the right.

Therefore, the output across the load resistor R will be as shown in Fig. 29–32b.
Actually this is the voltage if the capacitor C were not in the circuit. The capacitor
tends to store charge and, if the time constant RC is sufficiently long, helps to
smooth out the current as show
