fusion. Anytime that a substance is moving by diffusion, it is called passive transport because there
is no outside energy required to power the movement. It’s like riding a bicycle downhill. The molecules are just
“going with the flow.”
Passive transport does not require the input of metabolic energy. It is
important because it helps the cell import resources and export wastes.
Osmosis
When the water is diffusing, the process is called osmosis. Water always wants to move from an area where it is
most concentrated to an area where it is least concentrated. Water is not usually pure water; since it is so great at
dissolving things, it usually exists as a solution. A solution is made when a liquid solvent dissolves solute particles.
So, if we rethink water moving down its concentration gradient, this is the same as saying that it wants to go from
where there is less solute (i.e., watery solution) to where there is more solute (i.e., concentrated solution). It’s as if
the water is moving
