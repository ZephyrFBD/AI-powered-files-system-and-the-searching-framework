Metals on the Nanoscale
Metals also have unusual properties on the 1–100-nm-length scale. Fun-
damentally, this is because the mean free path 
 (Section 10.8) of an 
electron in a metal at room temperature is typically about 1–100 nm. 
So when the particle size of a metal is 100 nm or less, one might expect 
unusual effects because the “sea of electrons” encounters a “shore” (the 
surface of the particle).

2 powders with 
different particle sizes. The arrow indicates 
decreasing particle size and a corresponding 
increase in the band gap energy, resulting in 
different colors.

CHAPTER 12 Solids and Modern Materials
Macroporous materials have pores that are visible to the 
naked eye. Examples include the everyday synthetic sponge 
 
[Figure 12.46(a)] and the honeycomb-like cordierite core of an 
automobile catalytic converter [Figure 12.46(b)], with pore sizes 
in the mm size range and the tens of μm size range, respectively.
