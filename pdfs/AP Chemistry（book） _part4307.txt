 enthalpy change, ∆H, for melting a solid. 
(Section 11.4)
heat of sublimation The enthalpy change, ∆H, for vaporization 
of a solid. (Section 11.4)
heat of vaporization The enthalpy change, ∆H, for vaporization 
of a liquid. (Section 11.4)
Henderson–Hasselbalch equation The relationship among the 
pH, pKa, and the concentrations of acid and conjugate base in an 
aqueous solution: pH = pKa + log 
3base4
3acid4. (Section 17.2)
Henry’s law A law stating that the concentration of a gas in 
a solution, Sg, is proportional to the pressure of gas over the 
solution: Sg = kP
g. (Section 13.3)
Hess’s law If a reaction is carried out in a series of steps, ∆H for 
the overall reaction equals the sum of the enthalpy changes for 
the individual steps. (Section 5.6)
heterogeneous alloy An alloy in which the components are not 
distributed uniformly; instead, two or more distinct phases with 
characteristic compositions are present. (Section 12.3)
heterogeneous catalyst A catalyst that is in a diffe
