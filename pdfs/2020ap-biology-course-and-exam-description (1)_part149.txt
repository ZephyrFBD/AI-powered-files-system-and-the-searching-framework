while understanding 
that the chi-square is not always the most 
appropriate statistical test to analyze the 
results of an experiment.
Preparing for the AP Exam 
In this unit students need to analyze and 
construct models of chromosomal exchange, 
using them to predict the results of a given 
scenario, such as a mistake in crossing over 
or the haploid results of meiosis. 
Students also need to calculate genotypic 
and/or phenotypic ratios. Be sure students 
understand the difference in these two types 
of ratios, as confusion between them is a 
common student error on the exam. 
Additionally, students should expect to 
calculate a chi-square value and explain the 
meaning in context of a given scenario. On 
the exam, students commonly fail to identify 
the null hypothesis rather than an alternate 
hypothesis; thus, they will need multiple and 
varied opportunities to practice this skill. 
Building their skills in experimental design 
throughout the course will help address 
this misc
