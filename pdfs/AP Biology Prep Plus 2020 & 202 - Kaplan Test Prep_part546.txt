ions depends upon where they occur in the code.
Mutations of introns oȇen have no eﬀect on an individual because they
are not translated into proteins. Likewise, base-pair substitutions in third
position base pairs for a codon oȇen do not aﬀect the amino acid it codes
for (remember, the code is degenerate, or redundant); therefore, the
protein is unchanged. Most mutations in structural proteins are
deleterious, meaning that they negatively aﬀect the nature of the protein
and usually produce a nonviable cell. Some mutations in structural
proteins are viable and, if the mutation is in a gamete, are potentially
passed on to oﬀspring.
Types of Mutations
Point mutations occur when a single nucleotide base is substituted by
another. If the substitution occurs in a noncoding region, or if the
substitution is transcribed into a codon that codes for the same amino
acid as the previous codon, there will be no change in the resulting amino
acid sequence of the protein. This type of point mutation
