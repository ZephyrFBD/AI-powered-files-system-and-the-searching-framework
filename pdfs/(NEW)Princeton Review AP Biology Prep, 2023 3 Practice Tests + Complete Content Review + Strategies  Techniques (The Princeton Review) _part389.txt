uct phylogenetic trees. Shared traits indicate common ancestry.
Phylogenetic trees are hypotheses and are constantly being revised as new evidence emerges. Species B, C, D, and E
all have the shared character of 8 legs. Wings are a shared character for species D and E, but they could also be
considered a derived character since they separate species D and E from the rest of the species that do not have
wings. Populations of organisms are still evolving today. Genomes and the fossil record continue to change,
prokaryotes develop resistance to antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides, or chemotherapy drugs, and pathogens evolve
and cause emergent diseases.
GENETIC VARIABILITY
As you know, no two individuals are identical. The differences in each person are known as genetic variability. All
this means is that no two individuals in a population have identical sets of alleles (except, of course, identical twins).
In fact, survival of a species is dependent on this genetic variation; it allows a
