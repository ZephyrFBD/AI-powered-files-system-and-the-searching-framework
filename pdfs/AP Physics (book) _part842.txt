on, then its linear velocity is 
The total kinetic energy of the whole
object will be the sum of the kinetic energies of all its particles:
We have factored out the and the 
since they are the same for every particle 
of a rigid object. Since
the moment of inertia, we see that the kinetic
energy of a rigid rotating object is
(8;15)
The units are joules, as with all other forms of energy.
An object that rotates while its center of mass (CM) undergoes translational
motion will have both translational and rotational kinetic energy. Equation 8â€“15
gives the rotational kinetic energy if the rotation axis is fixed. If the object is
moving, such as a wheel rolling down a hill, this equation is still valid as long as
the rotation axis is fixed in direction. Then the total kinetic energy is
(8;16)
where 
is the linear velocity of the center of mass,
is the moment of inertia
about an axis through the center of mass,
is the angular velocity about this axis,
and M is the total mass of the object.
