urs when the sulfur atom in the amino acid cysteine bonds to the sulfur
atom in another cysteine (forming cystine, a kind of “double” amino acid). This disulfide bridge helps maintain the
folds of the amino acid chain (Figure 2-10).

4. The quaternary structure describes a protein that is assembled from two or more separate peptide chains. The
globular protein hemoglobin, for example, consists of four peptide chains that are held together by hydrogen
bonding and interactions among R groups.
Nucleic Acids
The genetic information of a cell is stored in molecules of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The DNA, in turn, passes
its genetic instructions to ribonucleic acid (RNA) for directing various metabolic activities of the cell.
DNA is a polymer of nucleotides. A DNA nucleotide consists of three parts —a nitrogen base, a five-carbon sugar
called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. There are four DNA nucleotides, each with one of the four nitrogen
bases, as follows (see Figure 2-11):
