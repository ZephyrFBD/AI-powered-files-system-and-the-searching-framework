overnight in a large volume of water may destain too much. 
■ Timing and Length of Lab 
Day Before the Lab 
It is recommended that you prepare the TAE buffer and 0.8% agarose the day before 
the lab. This will take approximately 15 minutes. You will also need to spend about 30 
minutes setting up student work stations and gathering electrophoresis equipment, 
preparing DNA “evidence” samples, test tube racks, etc. If you prefer to cast agarose gels 
for students, it will take approximately 20 minutes to pour gels into casting trays. The 
TAE buffer is stable and can be prepared ahead of time and stored. 
Lab Day 1 
Students will spend approximately 45 minutes reading the scenario and background 
material, working through several prelab activities, and familiarizing themselves with 
the procedure for gel electrophoresis. However, Getting Started can be assigned for 
homework. You can also have students view any of several online vi
