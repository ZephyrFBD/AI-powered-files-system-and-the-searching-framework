d be debated and mulled over, but what you could
not suggest was that ‘SARS-Cov-2’ didn’t exist. That would be
ridiculous. ‘Everybody knows’ the ‘virus’ exists. Well, I didn’t for
one along with American proper doctors like Andrew Kaufman and
Tom Cowan and long-time American proper journalist Jon
Rappaport. We dared to pursue the obvious and simple question:
‘Where’s the evidence?’ The overwhelming majority in medicine,
journalism and the general public did not think to ask that. AĞer all,
everyone knew there was a new ‘virus’. Everyone was saying so and I
heard it on the BBC. Some would eventually argue that the ‘deadly
virus’ was nothing like as deadly as claimed, but few would venture
into the realms of its very existence. Had they done so they would
have found that the evidence for that claim had gone AWOL as with
HIV causes AIDS. In fact, not even that. For something to go AWOL

can be ﬁled under nothing, nowh
