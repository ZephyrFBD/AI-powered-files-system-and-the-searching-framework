wever, they can contain different versions (or
alleles) of those genes, and thus have different genetic sequences.
When an organism has two identical alleles for a given trait, the organism is homozygous. If an organism has
two different alleles for a given trait, the organism is heterozygous.
When discussing the physical appearance of an organism, we refer to its phenotype. The phenotype tells us
what the organism looks like. When talking about the genetic makeup of an organism, we refer to its genotype.
The genotype tells us which alleles the organism possesses.
An allele can be dominant or recessive. This is determined by which allele “wins out” over the other in a
heterozygote. The convention is to assign one of two letters for the two different alleles. The dominant allele
receives a capital letter and the recessive allele receives a lowercase of the same letter. For instance, we might
give the dominant allele for height in pea plants a T for tall. This means that the recessive al
