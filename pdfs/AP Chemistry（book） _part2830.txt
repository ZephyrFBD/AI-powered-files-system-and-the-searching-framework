 with di-
lute HCl; no precipitate forms. The pH is adjusted to about 
1, and H2S is bubbled through. Again, no precipitate forms. 
The pH of the solution is then adjusted to about 8. Again, 
H2S is bubbled through. This time a precipitate forms. The 
filtrate from this solution is treated with 1NH422HPO4. No 
precipitate forms. Which of these metal cations are either 
possibly present or definitely absent: Al3 +, Na +, Ag +, Mg2 +?
 17.78  An unknown solid is entirely soluble in water. On ad-
dition of dilute HCl, a precipitate forms. After the pre-
cipitate is filtered off, the pH is adjusted to about 1 and 
H2S is bubbled in; a precipitate again forms. After fil-
tering off this precipitate, the pH is adjusted to 8 and 
H2S is again added; no precipitate forms. No precipitate 
forms upon addition of 1NH422HPO4. The remaining 
solution shows a yellow color in a flame test (see Figure 
7.22). Based on these observations, which of the fol-
lowing compounds might be present, which are d
