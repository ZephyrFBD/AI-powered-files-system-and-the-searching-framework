tin; genes in these regions of the genome are not able to be expressed.
The uncoiling of DNA in a region—which is partly controlled by histone proteins associated
with DNA—produces less tightly packed euchromatin, allowing regulatory proteins to access
genes in that region.
ii. To allow for transcription after a region of DNA has been unpackaged, regulatory proteins, such
as transcription factors, bind to the regulatory elements of the gene, thereby allowing access to the
promoter by RNA polymerase.
Some transcription factors bind directly to the promoter to assist the binding of RNA
polymerase.
Other transcription factors bind to DNA regions surrounding the gene, called enhancers, to
further assist RNA polymerase binding.
Once RNA polymerase binds to the promoter, transcription can occur.
By controlling the synthesis and activity of transcription factors, a cell determines which
gene will be expressed and when.
iii. After transcription, opportunities for control of gene expression can
