61. In a rapidly changing environment, which prokaryotic
population would you hypothesize likely to be more
successful: one that included individuals capable of
conjugation or one that did not?
a.
A population including individuals capable of
conjugation would be more successful because
all of its members would form recombinant cells
having new gene combinations advantageous in
a new environment.
b.
A population including individuals capable of
conjugation would be more successful as some
members could form recombinant cells having
new gene combinations advantageous in a new
environment.
c.
A population including individuals not capable
of conjugation would be more successful as the
members undergoing conjugation would form
new recombinant cells having gene
combinations lethal in the new environment.
d.
A population including individuals not capable
of conjugation would be more successful
because conjugation will result in an increase
