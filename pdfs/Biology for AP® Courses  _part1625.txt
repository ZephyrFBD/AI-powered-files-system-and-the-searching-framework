In addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain, three of the 64 codons terminate
protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery. These triplets are called nonsense codons, or
stop codons. Another codon, AUG, also has a special function. In addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also
serves as the start codon to initiate translation. The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5'
end of the mRNA.
The genetic code is universal. With a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis.
Conservation of codons means that a purified mRNA encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip
cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. That there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on
Earth shares a common origin, especially considering that there are about 1084 possible
