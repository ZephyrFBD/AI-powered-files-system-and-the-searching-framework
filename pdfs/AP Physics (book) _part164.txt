on of a car. How long does it take a car to cross 
a 30.0-m-wide intersection after the light turns green, if the car accelerates from
rest at a constant 
APPROACH We follow the Problem Solving Strategy on the previous page,
step by step.
SOLUTION
1. Reread the problem. Be sure you understand what it asks for (here, a time
interval: “how long does it take”).
2. The object under study is the car. We need to choose the time interval
during which we look at the car’s motion: we choose
the initial time,
to be the moment the car starts to accelerate from rest
the time 
is the instant the car has traveled the full 30.0-m width of the intersection.
3. Draw a diagram: the situation is shown in Fig. 2–15, where the car is shown
moving along the positive x axis. We choose
at the front bumper of
the car before it starts to move.
4. The “knowns” and the “wanted” information are shown in the Table in the
margin. Note that “starting from rest” means
at
that is,
The wanted time is how long it takes t
