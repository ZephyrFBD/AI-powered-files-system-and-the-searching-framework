 not heritable, it doesn’t matter how much it may increase fitness because it cannot be passed on to the
next generation and cannot accumulate in the population. Such “acquired” characteristics do not contribute to
evolution. Even mutations that occur in somatic tissues do not count. In order for a trait to contribute to evolution, it
must be encoded in alleles that will be incorporated into gametes.
c. If there are unlimited resources and unlimited availability of mates, differences among individuals won’t have any
effect on their ability to produce offspring. But, eventually, as the population continues to grow, resources will
become limited. Then, individuals must compete for those resources. Individuals with the traits that increase their
ability to obtain resources will produce more offspring, passing their genes to the next generation. Without
competition, there is no natural selection and no evolution.
