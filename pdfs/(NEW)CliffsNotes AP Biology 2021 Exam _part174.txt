is necessary for Pathway B, the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle “fixes” CO2
and produces G3P, the
 
precursor to glucose.
 
15. A. Although the Calvin cycle is light-independent, it requires ATP and NADPH from photophosphorylation,
which occurs only in light.
 
16. A. CO2 uptake is a measure of Calvin cycle activity. The Calvin cycle
 
generates glucose, the end product of photosynthesis. Many factors, including those provided in the other answer
choices, influence
 
photosynthetic rate. However, CO2 uptake alone only indicates the
 
amount of photosynthetic activity, not why that photosynthetic activity is occurring at some measured rate.
17. C. According to this graph, CO2 uptake is greater when there is more CO2 in the growth chamber (the 200 ppm
curve), and when O2 is minimum (the left side of the graph). Lower concentrations of O2
minimize photorespiration.
