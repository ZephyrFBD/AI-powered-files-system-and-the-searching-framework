 ease of oxidation or reduction. Silver ion, for example, is readily reduced in 
water,
 
Ag+(aq) + e- ¡ Ag(s)  E° = +0.799 V 
 
[23.2]
but the 3Ag(CN)24- ion is not so easily reduced because complexation by CN- ions stabi-
lizes silver in the +1 oxidation state:
 
3Ag(CN)24-(aq) + e- ¡ Ag(s) + 2 CN-(aq) E° = -0.31 V

Palladium(II) tends to form complexes with coordination number 4. A compound has the composition PdCl2 # 3 NH3. (a) Write the 
formula for this compound that best shows the coordination structure. (b) When an aqueous solution of the compound is treated 
with excess AgNO3(aq), how many moles of AgCl(s) are formed per mole of PdCl2 # 3 NH3?
Sample Exercise 23.1 
Identifying the Coordination Sphere of a Complex
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the coordination number of Pd(II) and a 
chemical formula indicating that the complex contains NH3 and 
Cl-. We are asked to determine (a) which ligands are attached to 
Pd(II) in the compound and (b) how the compound behaves to-
