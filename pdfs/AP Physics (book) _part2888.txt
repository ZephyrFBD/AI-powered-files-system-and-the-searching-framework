ects moving relative to us
at high speed, close to the speed
of light c, are shortened in
length. We don’t notice it as
Mr Tompkins did, because
is incredibly
fast. We will study length
contraction, time dilation,
simultaneity non-agreement, and
how energy and mass are

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
A rocket is headed away from Earth at a speed of 0.80c. The rocket fires a small
payload at a speed of 0.70c (relative to the rocket) aimed away from Earth. How
fast is the payload moving relative to Earth?
(a) 1.50c;
(b) a little less than 1.50c;
(c) a little over c;
(d) a little under c;
(e) 0.75c.

hysics at the end of the nineteenth century looked back on a period of
great progress. The theories developed over the preceding three centuries
had been very successful in explaining a wide range of natural phenomena.
Newtonian mechanics beautifully explained the motion of objects on
