ion will favor signals and responses that increase survival and the chances of successful reproduction.
Over time, this selection can lead to changes in the population and evolution.
Cooperative behaviors can lead to increased fitness of individuals and populations. One example of this are
murmurations in starlings. Murmurations occur when starlings fly in formations of hundreds, or sometimes even
thousands, of birds. When flying in these large cooperative groups, starlings are more protected from predators,
increasing their likelihood of survival. It is also thought that these large groups help the starlings keep warm.
Meerkats exhibit a wide range of cooperative behaviors. They huddle together for warmth and gather in groups to
groom each other, picking parasites out of each otherâ€™s fur. While some meerkats in the group are foraging for food,
other meerkats will serve as lookouts and will send a loud signal when any predators approach. Meerkats have even
been known to fight together
