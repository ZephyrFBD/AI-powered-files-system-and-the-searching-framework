dispenses a fine spray of 
gasoline into the automobile cylinder, as shown in the 
bottom drawing here. When an injector gets clogged, as 
shown in the top drawing, the spray is not as fine or even 
and the performance of the car declines. How is this ob-
servation related to chemical kinetics? [Section 14.1]
 
14.2 Consider the following graph of the concentration of a 
substance X over time. Is each of the following statements 
true or false? (a) X is a product of the reaction. (b) The 
rate of the reaction remains the same as time progresses. 
(c) The average rate between points 1 and 2 is greater than 
the average rate between points 1 and 3. (d) As time pro-
gresses, the curve will eventually turn downward toward 
the x-axis. [Section 14.2]

14.3 You study the rate of a reaction, measuring both the con-
centration of the reactant and the concentration of the 
product as a function of time, and obtain the following 
results:
