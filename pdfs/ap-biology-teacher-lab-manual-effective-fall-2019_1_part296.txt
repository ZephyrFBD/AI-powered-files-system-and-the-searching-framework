You can help students think about cell shape in relation to its function by providing 
examples. Epithelial cells in the small intestine have many microvilli that serve to 
increase the surface area. These cells take up nutrients from food and move the nutrients 
into the capillaries. An erythrocyte’s concave shape increases the rate of oxygen diffusion 
out of the cell and into the tissues. The elongated projection of the root hair — and the 
large number of them — greatly increases the surface area through which water and 
minerals pass into the root of a plant. 
Students should understand that temperature influences molecular kinetic energy 
directly. They have made observations but may not have made the connections. Ask 
them to remember what happened to the sugar they added when they prepared an iced 
coffee drink versus hot coffee. 
A more difficult concept for students to grasp is that molecular weight is inversely 
related to the rate of diffusion. Have students t
