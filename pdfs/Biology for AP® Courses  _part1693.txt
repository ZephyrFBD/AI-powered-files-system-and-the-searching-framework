NA from degradation and assist
translation
enzyme that “charges” tRNA molecules by catalyzing a bond between the tRNA and a
corresponding amino acid
three-nucleotide sequence in a tRNA molecule that corresponds to an mRNA codon
(GGCCAATCT) essential eukaryotic promoter sequence involved in binding transcription factors
states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs, which in turn specify the sequence of proteins
three consecutive nucleotides in mRNA that specify the insertion of an amino acid or the release of a polypeptide
chain during translation
in terms of RNA and protein, three “units” of RNA (nucleotides) specify one “unit” of protein (amino acid) in a
consecutive fashion
DNA sequence that is used by many species to perform the same or similar functions
prokaryotic RNA polymerase consisting of α, α, β, and β' but missing σ; this complex performs elongation
(of the genetic code) describes that a given amino acid can be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet;
the code is dege
