9%. (B) is correct. Note: grass is a
producer, the mouse is the secondary consumer, and the fungi are
decomposers.
11. D
Learning Objective: 12.3
Approximately 10% of the energy at one trophic level is transferred to
the next, and 200 J is 10% of 2,000 J, making (D) correct. (A)
underestimates the amount of photosynthetic plankton. There would
need to be 200,000 J of energy in photosynthetic plankton to support
2,000 J of energy in small fish. (B) underestimates the amount of
energy in tuna fish. (C) underestimates the amount of energy in animal
plankton. There would have to be 20,000 J of energy in animal
plankton to support 2,000 J of energy in small fish.
12. A
Learning Objective: 12.3
Feeding at the lowest possible trophic level maximizes the amount of
energy available to people. At each higher trophic level, energy is lost
due to the organisms’ requirements to maintain cells, grow, and
reproduce. Thus, (A) is correct. For example, if there were 200,000 J of
energy in photosyntheti
