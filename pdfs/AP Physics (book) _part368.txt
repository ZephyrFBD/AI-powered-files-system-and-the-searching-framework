ich it will be in this case.
What really happens here is that the box accelerates upward (
) because
the net force is not zero. The net force (setting the normal force  
) is
upward. See Fig. 4–16. We apply Newton’s second law and see that the box
moves upward with an acceleration
= 0.20 ms2 .

Apparent weight loss. A 65-kg woman descends in an
elevator that briefly accelerates at 0.20g downward. She stands on a scale that
reads in kg. (a) During this acceleration, what is her weight and what does 
the scale read? (b) What does the sc
