Determine the correct answer for each question and enter it in the grid on page 3 of the answer sheet.  
Use the following guidelines for entering your answers. 
•
Start your answer in any column, space permitting. Unused columns should be left blank.
•
Write your answer in the boxes at the top of the grid and fill in the corresponding circles. Mark only one
circle in any column. You will receive credit only if the circles are filled in completely.
•
Provide your answer in the format specified by the question. The requested answer may be an integer, a
decimal, or a fraction, and it may have a negative value.
•
To enter a fraction, use one of the division slashes to separate the numerator from the denominator, as shown
in the example below. Fractions only need to be reduced enough to fit in the grid.
•
Do not enter a mixed number, as this will be scored as a fraction. For example, 2 1/2 (two and one-half) will
be scored as 21/2 (twenty-one halves).
