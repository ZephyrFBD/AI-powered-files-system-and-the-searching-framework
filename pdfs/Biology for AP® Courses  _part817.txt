ive effect of ADP.
Steps 3 and 4. Steps three and four are both oxidation and decarboxylation steps, which release electrons that reduce NAD+
to NADH and release carboxyl groups that form CO2 molecules. Î±-Ketoglutarate is the product of step three, and a succinyl
group is the product of step four. CoA binds the succinyl group to form succinyl CoA. The enzyme that catalyzes step four

is regulated by feedback inhibition of ATP, succinyl CoA, and NADH.
Step 5. In step five, a phosphate group is substituted for coenzyme A, and a high-energy bond is formed. This energy is
used in substrate-level phosphorylation (during the conversion of the succinyl group to succinate) to form either guanine
triphosphate (GTP) or ATP. There are two forms of the enzyme, called isoenzymes, for this step, depending upon the type of
animal tissue in which they are found. One form is found in tiss
