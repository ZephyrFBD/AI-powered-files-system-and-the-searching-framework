fungi would have the poky phenotype?
(d) Justify your prediction.
4. A diverse flock of finches that can eat many sizes of seeds lives on a small island in Polynesia, which recently
experienced a drought. Trees producing robust, medium-sized seeds died out in large numbers but more
resilient trees that produced both small and large-sized seeds are thriving. The finches can shelter in the trees
or in burrows underground. The island is home to several tree species that do not produce edible seeds and
small rodents that also eat the seeds.
(a) Finches are incapable of digging burrows yet approximately 25% of the finches found on the island live in
underground dwellings. Describe the source of the finch dwellings.
(b) Describe the relationship between the finches and rodents on the island.
(c) Protein HITB8 is found to be present in high levels in medium-sized beak finches and less so in other finch
types. Predict what will happen to the frequency of this protein product in the finch popul
