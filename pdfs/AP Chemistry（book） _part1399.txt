r, the bond dipoles do not directly oppose each other and 
therefore do not cancel. Hence, the H2O molecule has an overall nonzero dipole moment 
(measured dipole moment, m = 1.85 D) and is therefore a polar molecule. The oxygen 
atom carries a partial negative charge, and the hydrogen atoms each have a partial posi-
tive charge, as shown in Figure 9.10(b).
Figure 9.11 shows some examples of polar and nonpolar molecules, all with polar 
bonds. The molecules in which the central atom is symmetrically surrounded by 
identical atoms (BF3 and CCl4) are nonpolar. For ABn molecules in which all the B atoms 
are the same, certain symmetrical shapes—linear 1AB22, trigonal planar 1AB32, tetrahe-
dral and square planar 1AB42, trigonal bipyramidal 1AB52, and octahedral 1AB62—must 
lead to nonpolar molecules even though the individual bonds might be polar.
