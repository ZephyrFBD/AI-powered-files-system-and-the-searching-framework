 there are  
polyatomic ions, such 
as NH +
4  (ammonium ion) and SO 2-
4  (sulfate ion), which consist of atoms joined as in 
a molecule, but carrying a net positive or negative charge. Polyatomic ions will be dis-
cussed in Section 2.8.
It is important to realize that the chemical properties of ions are very different from 
the chemical properties of the atoms from which the ions are derived. The addition or 
removal of one or more electrons produces a charged species with behavior very different 
from that of its associated atom or group of atoms. For example, sodium metal reacts vio-
lently with water, but an ionic compound containing sodium ions, such as NaCl, does not.
Predicting Ionic Charges
As noted in Table 2.3, the elements of group 8A are called the noble-gas elements. The 
noble gases are chemically nonreactive elements that form very few compounds. Many 
atoms gain or lose electrons to end up with the same number of electrons as the noble
