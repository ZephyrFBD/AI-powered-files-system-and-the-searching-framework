 in a college biology lab can magnify cells up to approximately 400 times
and have a resolution of about 200 nanometers. (b) Electron microscopes provide a much higher magnification,
100,000x, and a have a resolution of 50 picometers. (credit a: modification of work by "GcG"/Wikimedia Commons;

Electron Microscopes
In contrast to light microscopes, electron microscopes (Figure 4.2b) use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light.
Not only does this allow for higher magnification and, thus, more detail (Figure 4.3), it also provides higher resolving
power. The method used to prepare the specimen for viewing with an electron microscope kills the specimen. Electrons
have short wavelengths (shorter than photons) that move best in a vacuum, so living cells cannot be viewed with an electron
microscope.
In a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cellâ€™s surface, creating details of cell
surface character
