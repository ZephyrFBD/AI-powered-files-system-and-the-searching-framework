54. Why is the relationship between sustainable agriculture
and nitrogen fixers called a mutualism?
a.
Due to agrobacterium which are nitrogen fixers,
plants benefit from an endless supply of
nitrogen; soils benefit from being naturally
fertilized and bacteria benefit from using
photosynthates from plants.
b.
Due to rhizobia, which are nitrogen fixers, plants
benefit from an endless supply of nitrogen; soils
benefit from being naturally fertiliz
