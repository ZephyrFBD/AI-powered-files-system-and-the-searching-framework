strand. 
2. Assume you cut this fragment with the restriction enzyme EcoRI. The restriction 
site for EcoRI is 5’-GAATTC-3’
, and the enzyme makes a staggered (“sticky end”) cut 
between G and A on both strands of the DNA molecule. Based on this information, 
draw an illustration showing how the DNA fragment is cut by EcoRI and the 
resulting products.

S116  Investigation 9
Two pieces of DNA that are cut with the same restriction enzyme, creating either sticky 
ends or blunt ends, can be “pasted” together using DNA ligase by reconnecting bonds, 
even if the segments originated from different organisms. An example of combining 
two “sticky end” sequences from different sources is shown in Figure 1. The ability of 
enzymes to “cut and paste” DNA fragments from different sources to make recombinant 
DNA molecules is the basis of biotechnology.
