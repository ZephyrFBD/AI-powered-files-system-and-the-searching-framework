28. Describe the electron transfer pathway from
photosystem II to photosystem I in the light-dependent
reactions.
a.
After splitting water in PS-II, high energy
electrons are delivered through the chloroplast
electron transport chain to PS-I.
b.
After splitting water in PS-I, high energy
electrons are delivered through the chloroplast
electron transport chain to PS-II.
c.
After the photosynthesis reaction, the released
products like glucose help in the transfer of
electrons from PS-II to PS-I.
d.
After the completion of the light dependent
reactions, the electrons are transferred from PS-
II to PS-I.
29. What will happen to a plant leaf that loses CO2 too
quickly?
a.
no effect on the
