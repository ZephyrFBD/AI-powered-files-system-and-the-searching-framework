 radius of 15 cm, and a mass of 48 kg? (b) How
much torque is required to slow her to a stop in 4.0 s,
assuming she does not move her arms?
67. (II) A person of mass 75 kg stands at the center of a rotating
merry-go-round platform of radius 3.0 m and moment of
inertia 
The platform rotates without friction
with angular velocity 
The person walks radially
to the edge of the platform. (a) Calculate the angular
velocity when the person reaches the edge. (b) Calculate
the rotational kinetic energy of the system of platform plus
person before and after the person’s walk.
68. (II) A potter’s wheel is rotating around a vertical axis
through its center at a frequency of 
The wheel
can be considered a uniform disk of mass 5.0 kg and diam-
eter 0.40 m. The potter then throws a 2.6-kg chunk of clay,
approximately shaped as a flat disk of radius 7.0 cm, onto
the center of the rotating wheel. What is the frequency
of the wheel after the clay sticks to it? Ignore friction.
69. (II) A 4.2-m-diameter
