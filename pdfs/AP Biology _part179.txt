PRACTICE QUESTIONS
Which of the following choices best describes the reaction below?
A + B → AB + energy
The reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme.
The reaction is catabolic.
The potential energy of the reactants is greater than the
potential energy of the products.
The reaction takes place in a warm environment.
When glucose is broken down in a cell, only about 38% of the
energy released is captured by the cell for later use. What happens to
the rest of the energy?
It is lost as heat.
It is used to break down other substances besides glucose.
It is stored within the cell to build necessary molecules.
It is used to increase the activity of enzymes.
You are performing an enzyme-controlled reaction: A + B + enzyme
→ AB. You monitor the formation of AB and see that it increases.
As instructed, you then add a small amount of substance X to the
reaction. To your surprise, the amount of AB being formed
decrea
