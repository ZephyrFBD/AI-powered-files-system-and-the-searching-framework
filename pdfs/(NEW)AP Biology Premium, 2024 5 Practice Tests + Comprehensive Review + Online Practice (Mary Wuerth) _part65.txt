 with ladybugs because its 95% confidence interval is the largest.
(b) The 95% confidence interval for the section that received no treatment does not overlap with the 95%
confidence intervals for the ladybug section or the chemical pesticide section. Thus, the section that received
no treatment is least like the others and is most likely to have a statistically significant difference in aphid
density from the ladybug- and chemical pesticideâ€“treated sections.
(c) If 50 measurements were taken in each section, the 95% confidence intervals would be smaller.
(d) To calculate 95% confidence intervals, add or subtract two times the standard error of the mean from the
mean of the data set. The standard error of the mean is inversely proportional to the sample size (if the
sample size increases, the standard error of the mean decreases). So if the sample size, n, increased to 50 for
all three sections, the standard errors of the mean for each section would likely decrease, and the 95%
