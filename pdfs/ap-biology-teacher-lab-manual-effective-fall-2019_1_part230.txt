rns in a population, 
you need to make some important assumptions â€” all the gametes go into one infinite 
pool, and all have an equal chance of taking part in fertilization or formation of a zygote. 
For now, all zygotes live to be juveniles, all juveniles live to be adults, and no individuals 
enter or leave the population; there is also no mutation. Make sure to record these 
assumptions in your notebook; later, you will need to explore how your model responds 
as you change or modify these assumptions.

Step 4 Quantitatively describe the biological system. 
Spreadsheets are valuable tools that allow us to ask What if? questions. They can 
repeatedly make a calculation based on the results of another calculation. They can also 
model the randomness of everyday events. Our goal is to model how allele frequencies 
change through one life cycle of this imaginary population in the spreadsheet. Use 
the diagram in Figure
