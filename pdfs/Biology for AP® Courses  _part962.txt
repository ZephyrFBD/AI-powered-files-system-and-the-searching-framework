Photosynthetic organisms began to use light reactions as well as dark reactions.
The Energy Cycle
Whether the organism is a bacterium, plant, or animal, all living things access energy by breaking down carbohydrate
molecules. But if plants make carbohydrate molecules, why would they need to break them down, especially when it has
been shown that the gas organisms release as a “waste product” (CO2) acts as a substrate for the formation of more food in
photosynthesis? Remember, living things need energy to perform life functions. In addition, an organism can either make
its own food or eat another organism—either way, the food still needs to be broken down. Finally, in the process of breaking
down food, called cellular respiration, heterotrophs release needed energy and produce “waste” in the form of CO2 gas.
In nature, there is no such thing as waste. Every single atom of matter and energy is conserved, recycling over and
