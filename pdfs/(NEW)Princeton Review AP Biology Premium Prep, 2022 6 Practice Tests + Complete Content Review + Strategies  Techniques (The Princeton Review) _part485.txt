r each row of the table, and summed.
The calculated χ2 value is 6.24. Next, this value needs to be compared to a critical value (CV). This is obtained from
a table like this one.
This chart is included on the AP Biology Equations and Formulas sheet. In order to use this table, you must know
the degrees of freedom (DF), which represent the number of independent variables in the data. In most cases, this is
the number of possibilities being compared minus one. In this example, DF = 4 – 1, because we are comparing four
different family types.
You also need a reference p-value. This is the probability of observing a deviation from the expected results due to
chance. For most biological tests, a p-value of 0.05 is used.
Since we are using DF = 3 and p = 0.05, the critical value is 7.82 (according to the chart above). Next, the critical
value is compared to the χ2 value; if χ2 < CV, you accept Ho. If χ2 > CV, you reject Ho. We calculated an χ2 value of
6.24, which is smaller than 7.82. Since
