refore, (B) is correct. Although the fixed T allele results in an
entire third generation of long-tailed cheetahs, that does not make it a
superior phenotype. Long tails may be better suited in that particular
environment, but natural selection could just as easily act on short-tailed
cheetahs in a diﬀerent environment, so (A) is incorrect. Natural selection
selected for a single allele in the population over three generations; since
(C) mentions two alleles, it cannot be correct. While it is not known what
the allele frequencies were in the original cheetah population, it is clear
that at least two alleles, T and t, for tail length existed before the mass
extinction. Since the allele for short tails exists in the original cheetah
population and is lost by the third generation, then (D) must be incorrect.

In DNA, guanine pairs with cytosine and adenine pairs with thymine. If
27% of the bases are guanine, then another 27% of the bases are cytosine.
Therefore, 100% – 27% – 27% = 46
