absent. In natural settings, intermittent wildfires regularly remove trees and shrubs,
helping to maintain the open areas that wild lupine requires. Mathematical models can be used to understand how wildfire
suppression by humans has led to the decline of this important plant for the Karner blue butterfly.
Community Ecology
A biological community consists of the different species within an area, typically a three-dimensional space, and the
interactions within and among these species. Community ecologists are interested in the processes driving these interactions
and their consequences. Questions about conspecific interactions often focus on competition among members of the same
species for a limited resource. Ecologists also study interactions among various species; members of different species are
called heterospecifics. Examples of heterospecific interactions include predation, parasitism, herbivory, competition, and
pollination. These interactions can have regulating effects on popu
