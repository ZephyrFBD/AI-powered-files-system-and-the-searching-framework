Methanogens are strictly anaerobic. Estimates of global
fluxes of methane from major sources (Kirschke, Nature
Geoscience, 2013, in units of 1012 g C/year) are shown in
the figure below. Agricultural sources are predominately
the microbiomes of ruminants (cows, goats, etc.) and rice
cultivated in shallow ponds where anoxic compost and
crop residues promote methanogen growth on roots. Other
major human activities that contribute to atmospheric
methane levels are landfills and natural gas drilling.

The fate of this methane is also shown. Most reacts with
OH in the lower atmosphere to make formic acid, which
then decomposes into carbon dioxide and water.
Methanotrophs consume the remaining methane.
Methane is a component of the carbon cycle, but it is much
less significant than carbon dioxide, whose major fluxes
are shown in units of 1015 g C/year (NASA, 2015). Oceanic
uptake and loss of CO2 are primarily abiotic. Prokaryotic
