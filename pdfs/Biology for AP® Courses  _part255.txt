conditions. Using this fact, justify the selection of these
data shown in the graphs in the construction of a model of
ocean photosynthetic productivity.
Iron and molybdenum are two of 30 elements that are
required by the chemical processes supporting life on
Earth. Concentrations of these two and 15 others are
shown in the graph at the right. Of these elements, the
three most abundant in cells are also found in seawater in
approximately the same concentrations. By increasing the
mass of phytoplankton in the ocean, we may be able to
compensate for the increasing concentration of carbon
produced by the combustion of gas, oil, and coal.
B. Select, with justification, the element or elements that,
if added in large amounts to the ocean, could boost the
growth of phytoplankton.
C. Before implementing a large-scale geo-engineering
effort to avert the effects of climate change due to carbon
pollution, we must test the legitimacy of this solution.
Describe a plan for collecting data that co
