destroyed by a blowout, a disaster that destroys the ecosystem once again.
One example of primary succession that was studied in detail occurred
at the southern edge of Lake Michigan. As the lakeshore gradually receded
northward after the last ice age (10,000 years ago), it left a series of new
beaches and sand dunes exposed. Today, someone who begins at the
waterâ€™s edge and walks south for several miles will pass through a series
of communities that were formed in the last 10,000 years. These
communities represent the various stages beginning with bare, sandy beach
and ending with a climax community of old, well-established forests. In
some cases, the climax community is a beech-sugar maple forest; in other
areas the forest is a mix of hickory and oak.
The process known as secondary succession occurs when an existing
community has been cleared by some disturbance that leaves the soil
intact. This is what happened in 1988 in Yellowstone National Park when
