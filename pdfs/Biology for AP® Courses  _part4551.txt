These graphs summarize data collected in an area of Brazil
between 2005 and 2006. Researchers captured mosquitos
and counted the number of parous females. Parous females
are females that produced viable offspring. Based on the
information given, how would mosquito populations
change in Brazil if the climate shifted to very hot (above
30Â°C) and very dry (below 60% humidity) conditions for
an extended period of time? Explain your reasoning.
a.
The mosquito populations would decrease at
temperatures
