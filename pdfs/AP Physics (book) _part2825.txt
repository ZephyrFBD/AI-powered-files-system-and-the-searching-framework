radians.
SOLUTION In Eq. 25–7, we set
for the opening of the eye:
Yes, you could just resolve a car (roughly 2 m wide by 3 or 4 m long) and so
could count the number of cars in the lot.
EXERCISE E Someone claims a spy satellite camera can see 3-cm-high newspaper head-
lines from an altitude of 100 km. If diffraction were the only limitation 
use Eq. 25–7 to determine what diameter lens the camera would have.
25–8 Resolution of Telescopes and
Microscopes; the 
Limit
You might think that a microscope or telescope could be designed to produce 
any desired magnification, depending on the choice of focal lengths and quality
of the lenses. But this is not possible, because of diffraction. An increase in
magnification above a certain point merely results in magnification of the diffrac-
tion patterns. This can be highly misleading since we might think we are seeing
details of an object when we are really seeing details of the diffraction pattern.
