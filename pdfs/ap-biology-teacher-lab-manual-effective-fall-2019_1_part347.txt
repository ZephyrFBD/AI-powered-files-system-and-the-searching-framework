This investigation reinforces the following skills: 
•  Preparing solutions 
•  Preparing a serial dilution 
•  Measuring light intensity 
•  Developing and applying indices to represent the relationship between two  
quantitative values (e.g., an ET50 Index)  
•  Using reciprocals to modify graphical presentations 
•  Utilizing medians as a measure of central tendencies 
•  Constructing data tables and graphs 
•  Communicating results and conclusions 
■ Skills Development 
Students will develop the following skills: 
•  Applying the floating disk assay procedure to study photosynthesis or dissolved 
oxygen or carbon dioxide sensors with computer interface 
•  Measuring/calculating rates of photosynthesis 
■ Potential Challenges 
Students often come to biology with the misconception that plants undergo 
photosynthesis (only) and animals undergo cellular respiration. Students often forget 
that most plant cells also possess mito
