7. Strengths and weaknesses
7.1 Strengths

We consider the loss of heat comparatively accurately. Many kinds of the loss of
heat are under our consideration including the radiation of heat conduction
between water and air, the heat flux made by heat conduction between water and
air, the radiation of the water ’ s long-wave return and the evaporation of the
water.

With the help of Weber-Fechner law, we consider the feeling instead of the heat
stimulation so that we can ensure which strategy is better.

We use the comprehensive evaluation model to reduce the influence by the
assumed proportion.
7.2 Weaknesses

We discussed the situation that the overflow drain and the faucet are on the
opposite side carefully. When the overflow drain is near the faucet, we only
estimate
the loss of the heat roughly not accurately. This might affect out
strategy.

The proportion is considered by us,not supported by some study, so it i
