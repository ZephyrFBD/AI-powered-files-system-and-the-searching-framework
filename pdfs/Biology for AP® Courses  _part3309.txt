nical practice, endocrinologists may also be involved in primary research and development
activities. For example, ongoing islet transplant research is investigating how healthy pancreas islet cells
may be transplanted into diabetic patients. Successful islet transplants may allow patients to stop taking
insulin injections.

Connection for AP® Courses
Much of the information in this section is an application of the material we explored in the Cell Communication chapter
about cell communication and signaling pathways. Hormones are chemical signals (ligands) that mediate changes in target
cells by binding to specific receptors. Even though hormones released by endocrine glands can travel long distances through
the blood and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess the necessary r
