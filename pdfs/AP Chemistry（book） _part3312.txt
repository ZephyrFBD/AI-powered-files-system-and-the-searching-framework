action Zn1s2 +  2 H+1aq2
ยก Zn2+1aq2 + H21g2, for each of the following changes? 
(a) The pressure of the H2 gas is increased in the cathode 
half-cell. (b) Zinc nitrate is added to the anode half-cell. 
 
(c) Sodium hydroxide is added to the cathode half-cell, 
decreasing 3H+4. (d) The surface area of the anode is doubled.
 20.64  A voltaic cell utilizes the following reaction:
Al1s2 + 3 Ag+1aq2 ยก Al3+1aq2 + 3 Ag1s2
What is the effect on the cell emf of each of the following 
changes? (a) Water is added to the anode half-cell, dilut-
ing the solution. (b) The size of the aluminum electrode is 
increased. (c) A solution of AgNO3 is added to the cathode 
half-cell, increasing the quantity of Ag+ but not changing 
its concentration. (d) HCl is added to the AgNO3 solution, 
precipitating some of the Ag+ as AgCl.
 20.65  A voltaic cell is constructed that uses the following reaction 
and operates at 298 K:
Zn1s2 + Ni2+1aq2 ยก Zn2+1aq2 + Ni1s2
(a) What is the emf of this cell under standard c
