response. The loss
of an acquired behavior is called extinction.
6. Spatial learning is another form of associative learning. It occurs when an animal associates attributes of a
location (landmarks) with the reward it gains by being able to identify and return to that location.
Nikolaas Tinbergen observed that wasps were able to associate nearby markers (pine cones) with the location of
their nests. When Tinbergen removed the markers, the wasps were unable to locate their nests.
7. Habituation is a learned behavior that allows the animal to disregard meaningless stimuli.
Sea anemones pull food into their mouths by withdrawing their tentacles. If the tentacles are stimulated with
nonfood items (a stick, for example), the tentacles will ignore the stimulus after several futile attempts to capture the
“food.”
8. Observational learning occurs when animals copy the behavior of another animal without having experienced
any prior positive reinforcement with the behavior.
