2. Set up student and common workstations.  
See the list of materials to be supplied at each workstation.  
Some leftover materials can be combined and stored for future use. For example, extra 
salt solutions (CaCl2 in the case of this lab), solutions of DNA, and buffers can be stored 
in a refrigerator freezer. Where possible, standardize materials for use in multiple labs. 
This allows you to keep fewer items but larger quantities, giving some leeway for making 
extra as needed. However, if the plasmid goes through multiple freeze-thaw cycles in 
a frost-free freezer, the DNA in the plasmid can degrade. It is recommended that you 
check the shelf life of materials with the commercial vendor.

Another tip is to keep a running list of studentsâ€™ experiments. After a couple of lab 
cycles, you should know what students are likely to want to use for their independent 
investigations, so you can have the materials on hand in advanc
