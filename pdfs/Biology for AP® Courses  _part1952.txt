pping - stained sections of
chromosomes are analyzed using microscope,
the distance between genetic markers can be
found; Radiation hybrid mapping - breaks DNA
using radiation and is affected by recombination
frequency; Sequence mapping - DNA
sequencing technology used to create physical
maps.

markers can be found; Radiation hybrid mapping
- breaks DNA using radiation and is unaffected
by recombination frequency; Sequence mapping
- DNA sequencing technology used to create
physical maps.
