nd procedures to do this are generally beyond the 
reach of most introductory laboratories.
In Getting Started, students conduct prelab research on the process of photosynthesis 
and review concepts they may have studied previously â€” particularly concepts about the 
properties of light.
In the first part of the lab, students learn how to measure the rate of photosynthesis 
indirectly by using the floating leaf disk procedure to measure oxygen production. 
Alternatively, they could explore how to measure the rate of photosynthesis using 
various probes interfaced to computers. 
In the floating leaf disk procedure, a vacuum is used to remove trapped air and 
infiltrate the interior of plant (leaf) disk samples with a solution containing bicarbonate 
ions that serve as a carbon source for photosynthesis. The infiltrated leaves sink in the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bicarbonate solution. When placed in sufficient light, the photosynthetic processes then 
produce oxyge
