large change in the voltage drop across the output

Hence a transistor can amplify a small signal into a larger one.
Typically a small ac signal (call it 
) is to be amplified, and when added to
the base bias current (and voltage) causes the current and voltage at the collector
to vary at the same rate but magnified. Thus, what is important for amplification
is the change in collector current for a given input change in base current. We label
these ac signal currents (
in 
and 
) as 
and 
The current gain is
defined as the ratio
may be on the order of 10 to 100. Similarly, the voltage gain is
Transistors are the basic elements in modern electronic amplifiers of all sorts.
A pnp transistor operates like an npn, except that holes move instead of elec-
trons. The collector voltage is negative, and so is the base voltage in normal operation.
Another kind of transistor, very important, is the MOSFET (metal-oxide
semiconductor field-effect transistor) common in digital circuits as a
