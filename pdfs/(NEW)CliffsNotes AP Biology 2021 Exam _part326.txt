ors). DNA controls the cell in this manner because it
contains codes for polypeptides. Many polypeptides are enzymes that regulate chemical reactions, and these
chemical reactions influence the resulting characteristics of the cell.
The process that describes how enzymes and other proteins are made from DNA is called protein synthesis. The
three steps in protein synthesis are transcription, RNA processing, and translation. In transcription, RNA
molecules are created by using one strand of the DNA molecule as a template. After transcription, RNA processing
modifies the RNA molecule with deletions and additions. In translation, the processed RNA molecules are used to
assemble amino acids into a polypeptide.
There are three kinds of RNA molecules necessary for protein synthesis that are produced during transcription, as
follows:
1. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a single strand of RNA that provides the template used for sequencing amino acids
into a polypeptide. A triplet group of three adjacent
