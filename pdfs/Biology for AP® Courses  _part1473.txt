20. Studies like the one described in question AP12.1 were
carried out by Morgan and Sturtevant beginning in 1911.
The discovery of linkage was made by Bateson and
Punnett in 1900. They crossed a true-breeding purple (P)
plant with long seeds (L) with a true-breeding red (r) plant
with round seeds (l). They then performed a self-cross
between the F1 generations. They obtained the F2 data
shown below.

A. Use the symbols P, p, L, and l to construct a
representation of the F2 genotypes and complete the
second column in the table.
B. Complete the fourth column of the table above by
recording the values of the predicted numbers of plants
with each genotype.
C. Apply a c2 test at the 95% confidence level to evaluate
the claim that these data confirm linkage. The definition
