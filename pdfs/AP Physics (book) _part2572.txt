ng sign conventions:
1. The focal length is positive for converging lenses and negative for diverging lenses.
2. The object distance is positive if the object is on the side of the lens from which
the light is coming (this is always the case for real objects; but when lenses
are used in combination, it might not be so: see Example 23–16); otherwise,
it is negative.
3. The image distance is positive if the image is on the opposite side of the lens from
where the light is coming; if it is on the same side,
is negative. Equivalently,
the image distance is positive for a real image (Fig. 23–40) and negative for
a virtual image (Fig. 23–41).
4. The height of the image,
is positive if the image is upright, and negative if the
image is inverted relative to the object. (
is always taken as upright and positive.)
The magnification, m, of a lens is defined as the ratio of the image height to
object height,
From Figs. 23–40 and 23–41 and the conventions just
stated (for which we will need a minus
