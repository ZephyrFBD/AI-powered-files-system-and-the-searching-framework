 6.106  The stratospheric ozone 1O32 layer helps to protect us 
from harmful ultraviolet radiation. It does so by absorbing 
ultraviolet light and falling apart into an O2 molecule and an 
oxygen atom, a process known as photodissociation.

 Use the data in Appendix C to calculate the enthalpy change 
for this reaction. What is the maximum wavelength a pho-
ton can have if it is to possess sufficient energy to cause this 
dissociation? In what portion of the spectrum does this 
wavelength occur?
 6.107  The discovery of hafnium, element number 72, provided 
a controversial episode in chemistry. G. Urbain, a French 
chemist, claimed in 1911 to have isolated an element 
number 72 from a sample of rare earth (elements 58–71) 
compounds. However, Niels Bohr believed that hafnium 
was more likely to be found along with zirconium than 
with the rare earths. D. Coster and G. von Hevesy, working 
in Bohr’s laboratory in Copenhagen, showed
