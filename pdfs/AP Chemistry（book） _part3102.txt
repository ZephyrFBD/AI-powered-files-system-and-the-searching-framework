, the 
sign of ∆G relates to the spontaneity of the process. When ∆G is 
negative, the process is spontaneous. When ∆G is positive, the 
process is nonspontaneous, but the reverse process is spontaneous. 
At equilibrium the process is reversible and ∆G is zero. The free 
energy is also a measure of the maximum useful work that can 
be performed by a system in a spontaneous process. The standard 
free-energy change, ∆G°, for any process can be calculated from 
tabulations of standard free energies of formation, ∆G°
f, which are de-
fined in a fashion analogous to standard enthalpies of formation, 
∆H°
f. The value of ∆G°
f  for a pure element in its standard state is de-
fined to be zero.
FREE ENERGY, TEMPERATURE, AND THE EQUILIBRIUM CON-
STANT (SECTIONS 19.6 AND 19.7) The values of ∆H and ∆S for 
a chemical process generally do not vary much with temperature. 
Therefore, the dependence of ∆G with temperature is governed 
mainly by the value of T in the expression ∆G = ∆H - T∆S. The
