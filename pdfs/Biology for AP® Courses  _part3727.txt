ood Flows Through the Body
Blood is pushed through the body by the action of the pumping heart. With each rhythmic pump, blood is pushed under
high pressure and velocity away from the heart, initially along the main artery, the aorta. In the aorta, the blood travels at
30 cm/sec. As blood moves into the arteries, arterioles, and ultimately to the capillary beds, the rate of movement slows
dramatically to about 0.026 cm/sec, one-thousand times slower than the rate of movement in the aorta. While the diameter of
each individual arteriole and capillary is far narrower than the diameter of the aorta, and according to the law of continuity,
fluid should travel faster through a narrower diameter tube, the rate is actually slower due to the overall diameter of all the
combined capillaries being far greater than the diameter of the individual aorta.
The slow rate of travel through the capillary beds, which reach almost every cell in the body, assists with gas and nutrient
exchange and also pro
