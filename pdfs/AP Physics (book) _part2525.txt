mation (Fig.23–13) and the more
blurred the image. This “defect” of spherical mirrors is called spherical aberration;
we will discuss it more with regard to lenses in Chapter 25. A parabolic reflector,
on the other hand, will reflect the rays to a perfect focus. However, because para-
bolic shapes are much harder to make and thus much more expensive, spherical
mirrors are used for most purposes. (Many astronomical telescopes use parabolic
reflectors, as do TV satellite dish antennas which concentrate radio waves to
nearly a point, Fig. 22–19.) We consider here only spherical mirrors and we will
assume that they are small compared to their radius of curvature so that the
image is sharp and Eq. 23–1 holds.
