y to donate a proton, we 
find that the more easily a substance gives up a proton, the less easily its conjugate base 
accepts a proton. Similarly, the more easily a base accepts a proton, the less easily its con-
jugate acid gives up a proton. In other words, the stronger an acid, the weaker its conjugate 
base, and the stronger a base, the weaker its conjugate acid. Thus, if we know how readily 
an acid donates protons, we also know something about how readily its conjugate base 
accepts protons.
The inverse relationship between the strengths of acids and their conjugate bases is 
illustrated in Figure 16.4. Here we have grouped acids and bases into three broad catego-
ries based on their behavior in water:
1. A strong acid completely transfers its protons to water, leaving essentially no undis-
sociated molecules in solution. 
 (Section 4.3) Its conjugate base has a negligible 
tendency to accept protons in aqueous solution. (The conjugate base of a strong acid 
shows negligible bas
