d make the cell thicker, to
reduce the loss of nutrients
c.
adaptations that make diffusion or nutrient
passage across their cell membrane more
efficient due to the large size of the cell
d.
adaptations that allow the cell to take in larger
food objects using the components of its cell
membrane
33. In the past, the Earth has experienced environmental
changes, which have changed the amount of available
oxygen and carbon dioxide in the water and air. For
example, there is evidence of less oxygen available in the
air during the time of the dinosaurs, a result of high
volcanic activity creating a large amount of carbon
dioxide. How might red blood cells in the dinosaurs have
evolved, in terms of size and shape, to adapt to the lower-
oxygen atmosphere?
a.
evolve smaller size and flatter shape.
b.
evolve larger size and a pointy shape.
c.
evolve smaller size and a thicker shape.
d.
evolve larger size and a shorter shape.
