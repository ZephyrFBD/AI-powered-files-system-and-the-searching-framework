r measures the
amount of light that is transmitted through a sample. The spectrophotometer in this experiment was set to measure
light at a wavelength of 605 nm.
The following data were collected for the healthy chloroplasts exposed to light.

1. D. After 15 minutes, water will move from the beaker (higher water potential) into the bag (lower water
potential), and the mass of the bag will increase. After 15 minutes, the solution inside the bag turns blue because the
IKI that diffuses into the bag mixes with the starch. When the bag is first placed in the beaker, the water potential in
