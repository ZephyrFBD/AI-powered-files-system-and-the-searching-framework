Questions 45â€“49 refer to the following passage.
A nettle has been discovered, native to a nation, that produces tiny flowers that come in two
colors: white and pink. The petals of the flowers come in two varieties: ruffled or slotted. After
years of studying them, it has been widely acknowledged that both traits follow classic Mendelian
inheritance patterns of dominance. The table below shows floral phenotypes in a small garden in
an isolated greenhouse, where the dominant phenotypes are the most plentiful and researchers
assume the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
