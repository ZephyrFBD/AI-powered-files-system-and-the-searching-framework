 value? What
are the corresponding wavelength and speed of the proton?
58. Use the quark model to describe the reaction
59. Identify the missing particle in the following reactions.
(a)
(b)
60. What fraction of the speed of light c is the speed of a 
7.0-TeV proton?
61. Using the information in Section 32–1, show that the Large
Hadron Collider’s two colliding proton beams can resolve
details that are less than 1/10,000 the size of a nucleus.
62. Searches are underway for a process called neutrinoless
double beta decay, in which a nucleus decays by emitting
two electrons. (a) If the parent nucleus is 
what would
the daughter nucleus be? (b) What conservation laws
would be violated during this decay? (c) How could 
decay to the same daughter nucleus without violating any
conservation laws?
63. Estimate the lifetime of the Higgs boson from the width of
the “bump” in Fig. 32–19, using the uncertainty principle.
[Note: This is not a realistic estimate because the underlying
processes are ve
