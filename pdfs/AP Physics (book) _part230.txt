ld the bolts be tied
so that the clinks occur at equal intervals? (Assume the
string is vertical with the bottom bolt touching the tin plate
when the string is released.)
3. A police car at rest is passed by a speeder traveling at a
constant 
. The police officer takes off in hot pursuit
and catches up to the speeder in 850 m, maintaining a
constant acceleration. (a) Qualitatively plot the position
vs. time graph for both cars from the police car’s start to
the catch-up point. Calculate (b) how long it took the
police officer to overtake the speeder, (c) the required
police car acceleration, and (d) the speed of the police car
at the overtaking point.
140 kmh
g = 9.8 ms2
4. Figure 2–51 is a position versus time graph for the motion of
an object along the x axis. Consider the time interval from
A to B. (a) Is the object moving in the positive or negative
x direction? (b) Is the object speeding up or slowing down?
(c) Is the acceleration of the object positive or negative? Now
consider
