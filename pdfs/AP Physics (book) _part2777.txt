 of pixels on a digital sensor.
Fine-grained films and tiny pixels are “slower,” meaning they require longer expo-
sures for a given light level. All pixels are rarely used because digital cameras have
averaging (or “compression”) programs, such as JPEG, which reduce memory size
by averaging over pixels where little contrast is detected. But some detail is inevi-
tably lost. For example, a small blue lake may seem uniform, and coding 600 pixels
as identical takes less memory than specifying all 600. Any slight variation of the
water surface is lost. Full “RAW” data uses more memory. Film records everything
(down to its grain size), as does RAW if your camera offers it. The processor also
averages over pixels in low light conditions, resulting in a less sharp photo.
The quality of the lens strongly affects the image quality, and we discuss lens
resolution and diffraction effects in Sections 25–6 and 25–7. The sharpness, or
resolution, of a lens is often given as so many lines per millim
