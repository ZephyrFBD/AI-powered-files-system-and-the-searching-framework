 but the 
entropy change can be large as molecules increase their degrees of 
freedom and motion. Figure 19.13 Based on the three molecules 
shown, the addition of each C increases S° by 40–45 J/mol@K. Based 
on this observation, we would predict that S°1C4H102 would 310–315 
J/mol@K. Appendix C conﬁrms that this is a good prediction: 
S°1C4H102 = 310.0 J>mol@K. Figure 19.14 Spontaneous Figure 
19.15 If we plot progress of the reaction versus free energy, equilib-
rium is at a minimum point in free energy, as shown in the ﬁgure. 
In that sense, the reaction runs “downhill” until it reaches that 
minimum point.

Figure 20.1  Exothermic. Figure 20.2 The permanganate ion,  
MnO4 
-, is reduced, as the half-reactions in the text show. The 
oxalate ion, C2O4
2-, acts as the reducing agent. Figure 20.3 The 
blue color is due to Cu2+1aq2. As this ion is reduced, forming Cu(s), 
its concentration decreases and the blue color fades. Figure
