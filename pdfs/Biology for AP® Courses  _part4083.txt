e. (b) Acrosomal reactions
help the sperm degrade the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allow the sperm to transfer its nucleus. (credit:

To ensure that no more than one sperm fertilizes the egg, once the acrosomal reactions take place at one location of the egg
membrane, the egg releases proteins in other locations to prevent other sperm from fusing with the egg. If this mechanism
fails, multiple sperm can fuse with the egg, resulting in polyspermy. The resulting embryo is not genetically viable and dies
within a few days.
Cleavage and Blastula Stage
The development of multi-cellular organisms begins from a single-celled zygote, which undergoes rapid cell division to
form the blastula. The rapid, multiple rounds of cell division are termed cleavage. Cleavage is illustrated in (Figure 34.21a).
After the cleavage has produced over 100 cells, the embryo is called a blastula. The blastula is usu
