d.
Angiotensin I is formed from angiotensin, which
is then converted to angiotensin II by ACE.
Aldosterone and ADH are then stimulated to be
released from angiotensin II.

33 | THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
Figure 33.1 In this compound light micrograph purple-stained neutrophil (upper left) and eosinophil (lower right)
are white blood cells that float among red blood cells in this blood smear. Neutrophils provide an early, rapid, and
nonspecific defense against invading pathogens. Eosinophils play a variety of roles in the immune response. Red
blood cells are about 7–8 µm in diameter, and a neutrophil is about 10–12µm. (credit: modification of work by Dr. David
