elength and Frequency
Two electromagnetic waves are represented in the margin. (a) Which 
wave has the higher frequency? (b) If one wave represents visible 
light and the other represents infrared radiation, which wave is 
which?
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Which type of visible light has a longer wavelelength, red 
or blue light?
SOLUTION
(a) Wave 1 has a longer wavelength (greater distance between 
peaks). The longer the wavelength, the lower the frequency 
1n = c>l2. Thus, Wave 1 has the lower  
frequency, and Wave 2 
has the higher frequency.
(b) The electromagnetic spectrum (Figure 6.4) indicates that 
infrared radiation has a longer wavelength than visible light. 
Thus, Wave 1 is infrared radiation.
