ource. In addition to the high temperatures necessary to initiate the reaction, there is 
the problem of confining the reaction. No known structural material is able to withstand 
the enormous temperatures necessary for fusion. Much research has centered on the use 
of an apparatus called a tokamak, which uses strong magnetic fields to contain and to 
heat the reaction. Temperatures of over 100,000,000 K have been achieved in a tokamak. 
Unfortunately, scientists have not yet been able to generate more power than is con-
sumed over a sustained period of time.
*Historically, a nuclear weapon that relies solely on a fission process to release energy is called 
an atomic bomb, whereas one that also releases energy via a fusion reaction is called a hydrogen 
bomb.

The lightest elements—hydrogen and helium along with very small 
amounts of lithium and beryllium—were formed as the universe 
expanded in the moments following the Big Bang. All the hea
