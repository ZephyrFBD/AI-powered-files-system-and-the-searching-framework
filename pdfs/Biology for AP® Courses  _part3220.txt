 for tastants are located across the
outer portion and front of the tongue, outside of the middle area where the filiform papillae are most prominent.

In humans, there are five primary tastes, and each taste has only one corresponding type of receptor. Thus, like olfaction,
each receptor is specific to its stimulus (tastant). Transduction of the five tastes happens through different mechanisms
that reflect the molecular composition of the tastant. A salty tastant (containing NaCl) provides the sodium ions (Na+) that
enter the taste neurons and excite them directly. Sour tastants are acids and belong to the thermoreceptor protein family.
Binding of an acid or other sour-tasting molecule triggers a change in the ion channel and these increase hy
