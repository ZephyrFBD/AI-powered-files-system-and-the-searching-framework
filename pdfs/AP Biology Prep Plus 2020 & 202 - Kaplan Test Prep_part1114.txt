w into plants
that will produce seeds without the mutation.
(A)
Harvesting the immature seeds from the original plant will allow the
aﬀected plant to invest all its energy in growing larger fruit.
(B)
Harvesting the immature seeds allows breeders to then grow plants
that will possess the seedless trait and produce a higher number of
seedless oﬀspring.
(C)
Harvesting the immature seeds and growing them into plants
enable breeders to cross breed them into a new species of grape.

48. To gain a better understanding of nodule regulation on the roots of
legumes infected with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, researchers grew Lotus
japonicus seedlings for 2 weeks in nitrogen-poor soil. Roots were
examined, and the number of nodules infected with bacteria was
counted. Shoot samples were found to have cytokinins (plant growth
substances) concentrated in the leaves. Nitrogen was then added to the
soil and maintained for a 2-week period. Researchers did not observe
new nodule formation. Cytokinins we
