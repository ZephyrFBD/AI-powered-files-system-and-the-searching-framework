he Lewis structures from parts (a) and (b)? Would you ex-
pect the molecule to be planar for both Lewis structures? 
(f) The six B¬N bonds in the borazine molecule are all 
identical in length at 1.44 Å. Typical values for the bond 
lengths of B¬ N single and double bonds are 1.51 Å and 
1.31 A
° , respectively. Does the value of the B¬N bond 
length seem to favor one Lewis structure over the other? 
(g) How many electrons are in the p system of borazine?
 9.104 
The highest occupied molecular orbital of a molecule is 
abbreviated as the HOMO. The lowest unoccupied molec-
ular orbital in a molecule is called the LUMO. Experimen-
tally, one can measure the difference in energy between 
the HOMO and LUMO by taking the electronic absorp-
tion (UV-visible) spectrum of the molecule. Peaks in the 
electronic absorption spectrum can be labeled as p
2p9p
2p*, 
s
2s9s
2s*, and so on, corresponding to electrons being pro-
moted from one orbital to another. The HOMO-LUMO tran-
sition corresponds
