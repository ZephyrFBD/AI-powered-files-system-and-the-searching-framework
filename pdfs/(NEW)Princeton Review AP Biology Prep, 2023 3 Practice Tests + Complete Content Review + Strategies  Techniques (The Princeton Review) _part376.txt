e reads DNA base pairs of a strand as a template and lays down complementary nucleotides
to generate a new complementary partner strand.
Replication proceeds continuously on the leading strand.
The lagging strand forms Okazaki fragments, which must be joined later by DNA ligase.
Transcription involves building RNA from DNA.
RNA polymerase reads one of the DNA strands (the antisense/non-coding/template strand) and adds RNA
nucleotides to generate a single strand of mRNA that will be identical to the other strand of DNA (the
coding/sense strand) except it will have uracil instead of thymine.
mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, and RNAi are all types of RNA that can be created.
mRNA gets processed in eukaryotic cells: introns are removed (spliced out), and a 5′ GTP cap and a 3′
poly(A) tail are added.
Translation occurs in the cytoplasm as mRNA carries the message to the ribosome.
mRNA passes through three sites on the ribosome, the A-site, the P-site, and the E-site.
The mRNA is read in triplets of three
