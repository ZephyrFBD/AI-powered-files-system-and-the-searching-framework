ge, such as with most animals including humans; haploid-
dominant, in which the multicellular haploid stage is the most obvious life stage, such as with all fungi and some algae;
and alternation of generations, in which the two stages are apparent to different degrees depending on the group, as with
plants and some algae.
Diploid-Dominant Life Cycle
Nearly all animals employ a diploid-dominant life-cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism
are the gametes. Early in the development of the embryo, specialized diploid cells, called germ cells, are produced within
the gonads, such as the testes and ovaries. Germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the cell line and meiosis to
produce gametes. Once the haploid gametes are formed, they lose the ability to divide again. There is no multicellular
haploid life stage. Fertilization occurs with the fusion of two gametes, usually from different individuals, restoring the
diploid state (Figure 11.8).
