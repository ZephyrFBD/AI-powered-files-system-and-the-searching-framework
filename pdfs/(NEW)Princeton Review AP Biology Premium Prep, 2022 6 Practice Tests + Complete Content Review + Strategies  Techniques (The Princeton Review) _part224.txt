 have the same unit. Q10 has no unit; it is the factor by which the rate of a reaction
increases due to a temperature increase. The more temperature-dependent a reaction is, the higher Q10 will be.
Reactions with Q10 = 1 are temperature independent.
pH
Enzymes also function best at a particular pH. At an incorrect pH, the hydrogen bonds can be disrupted and the
structure of the enzyme can be altered. For most enzymes, the optimal pH is at or near a pH of 7.
Other enzymes operate at a low pH. For instance, pepsin, the digestive enzyme found in the stomach, is most
effective at an extremely acidic pH of 2. The enzymes in the lysosome also function best in an acidic pH.
Relative Concentration of Substrates
The relative concentration of substrates can also affect the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. For example, an
increase in this concentration will initially speed up the reaction. However, once all of the enzyme in solution is
bound by substrate, the reaction can no longer speed up.
