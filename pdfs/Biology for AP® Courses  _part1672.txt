ng to each structural RNA. Some
of the bases of pre-rRNAs are methylated; that is, a –CH3 moiety (methyl functional group) is added for stability. Pre-
tRNA molecules also undergo methylation. As with pre-mRNAs, subunit excision occurs in eukaryotic pre-RNAs destined
to become tRNAs or rRNAs.
Mature rRNAs make up approximately 50 percent of each ribosome. Some of a ribosome’s RNA molecules are purely
structural, whereas others have catalytic or binding activities. Mature tRNAs take on a three-dimensional structure through
intramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end
(Figure 15.15). The anticodon is a three-nucleotide sequence in a tRNA that interacts with an mRNA codon through
complementary base pairing.
