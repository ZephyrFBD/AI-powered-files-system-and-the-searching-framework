lar neuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites. Multipolar neurons can be found in the central
nervous system (brain and spinal cord). An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum, which has
many branching dendrites but only one axon. Pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells.
A pseudounipolar cell has a single process that extends from the soma, like a unipolar cell, but this process later branches
into two distinct structures, like a bipolar cell. Most sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and have an axon that branches
into two extensions: one connected to dendrites that receive sensory information and another that transmits this information
to the spinal cord.

Figure 26.5 Neurons are broadly divided into four main types based on the number and placement of axons: (1)
unipolar, (2) bipolar, (3) multipol
