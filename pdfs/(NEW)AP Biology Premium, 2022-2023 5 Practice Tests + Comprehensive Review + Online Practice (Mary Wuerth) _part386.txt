inducer molecule is present. The repressor protein in an inducible operon binds to the operator sequence, blocking
transcription of the operon by RNA polymerase. However, when an inducer molecule is present, the inducer binds
to the repressor protein, changing its shape so that it can no longer bind to the operator sequence. This allows RNA
polymerase to begin transcribing the operon.
The classic example of an inducible operon is the lac operon, as shown in Figure 17.2. The function of the lac
operon is to produce the proteins required to digest the sugar lactose. If no lactose is present, the lac repressor
protein will bind to the operator, blocking transcription of the operon by RNA polymerase. Lactose serves as the
inducer molecule for the lac operon. When lactose is present, it binds to the lac repressor protein, changing its shape
so that it no longer can bind to the operator sequence. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the genes for the
proteins that digest lactose. Af
