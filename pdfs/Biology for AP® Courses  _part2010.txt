r although they are not members of the same species. For example, even though
bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) are both birds and eagles, each belongs
to a separate species group (Figure 18.11). If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize the egg of a bald eagle with
the sperm of an African fish eagle and a chick did hatch, that offspring, called a hybrid (a cross between two species), would
probably be infertileâ€”unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity. Different species may have different genes

that are active in development; therefore, it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of
directions. Thus, even though hybridization may take place, the two species still remain separate.
Figure 18.11 The (a) African fish eagle is similar in appearance to the (b) bald eagle, but the two birds are members of
different species. (credit
