d Variables): The things that are the same between all your groups. Hint: everything
should be constant except the independent variable.
Control Groups: Any group that is needed simply so you can compare your interesting experimental groups to
it. These are often the “no treatment” group.
Statistical Significance: The trustworthiness of the results and the certainty you have in your conclusions. This
can always be increased by including more individuals in the groups or including more trials.
Most biological experiments do one of three things:
1. look at how something changes over time
2. compare groups of some sort
3. test for an association
How you present and summarize data depends on what kind of experiment you perform.
Time-Course Experiments
Time-course experiments look at how something changes over time. A line graph is usually used to present this
type of data. Several lines can be plotted on the same graph, but these must be clearly labeled. Also, each dot on a
line graph coul
