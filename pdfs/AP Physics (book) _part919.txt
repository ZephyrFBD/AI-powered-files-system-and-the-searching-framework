determine the strength of cord or wire that must be
used. In this case, the cord must be able to support a mass of more than 230 kg.
NOTE We didn’t insert the value of g, the acceleration due to gravity, until the
end. In this way we found the magnitude of the force in terms of g times the
number of kilograms (which may be a more familiar quantity than newtons).
EXERCISE A In Example 9–2,
has to be greater than the chandelier’s weight, mg.
Why?
The Second Condition for Equilibrium
Although Eqs. 9–1 are a necessary condition for an object to be in equilibrium,
they are not always a sufficient condition. Figure 9–5 shows an object on which
the net force is zero. Although the two forces labeled 
add up to give zero net
force on the object, they do give rise to a net torque that will rotate the object.
