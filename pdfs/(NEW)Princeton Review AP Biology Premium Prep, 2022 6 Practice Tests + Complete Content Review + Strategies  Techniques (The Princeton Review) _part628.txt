y have been observed to produce as many as thirteen eggs per clutch. Data show that a clutch size larger
than nine or ten actually produces fewer surviving offspring. See Figure 1; the vertical axis gives the percent
occurrence of each brood size, and the numbers labelling the dots indicate the number of known survivors per
nest.

Additional evidence for the group-selection theory is that there appears to be a relationship between
reproductive success of individuals and the density of the population. When density is low, mortality is
likewise low and reproductive rate high. At high numbers resources are more scarce, and it is more difficult to
stay alive and to reproduce, so mortality is high and reproductivity low. Figure 2 shows the number of
surviving offspring per mating pair plotted against the number of breeding adults present (the graph covers
several years).
