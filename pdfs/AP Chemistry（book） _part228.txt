ed out because of its potential to cause cancer, 
has a mass of 40.55 g and a volume of 25.0 mL at 25 °C. What 
is its density at this temperature? Will tetrachloroethylene float 
on water? (Materials that are less dense than water will float.) 
 
(b) Carbon dioxide 1CO22 is a gas at room temperature and 
pressure. However, carbon dioxide can be put under pressure to 
become a “supercritical fluid” that is a much safer dry-cleaning 
agent than tetrachloroethylene. At a certain pressure, the den-
sity of supercritical CO2 is 0.469 g>cm3. What is the mass of a 
25.0-mL sample of supercritical CO2 at this pressure?

76.31 g at 25 °C. What is its density in g>cm3 at this tempera-
ture? (b) The density of titanium metal is 4.51g>cm3 at 25 °C. 
What mass of titanium displaces 125.0 mL of water at 25 °C?
