minum must be under water to make this system balance?
How would your answer change for a lead cube of the
same size? Explain. (See Sections 10–7 and 9–1.)
Oscillations and Waves
CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTIONS—Guess now!
1. A simple pendulum consists of a mass m (the “bob”) hanging
on the end of a thin string of length and negligible mass. The bob
is pulled sideways so the string makes a 5.0° angle to the vertical;
when released, it oscillates back and forth at a frequency f. If
the pendulum is started at a 10.0° angle instead, its frequency
would be
(a) twice as great.
(b) half as great.
(c) the same, or very close to it.
