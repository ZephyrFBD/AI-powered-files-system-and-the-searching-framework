Students can be divided into three groups. Each group will complete one of the three 
sections of the Signal Transduction POGIL. The teacher can debrief with each group 
to clarify misconceptions. Students will then rotate between groups so that they 
share their understandings of the model they studied and learn from one another. The 
teacher can follow up with a debrief to clarify any outstanding misconceptions.

Students can read a case study about cell signaling and then answer any questions that 
may accompany the case study. Alternately, teachers can provide appropriate questions 
and/or assignments to ensure that students understand the concepts addressed in the 
case study. Students can then do a fishbowl to discuss their learnings from the case 
study and applications to real life.
