You are investigating how the crustacean Daphnia responds to changes in temperature. You expose Daphnia to
temperatures of 5°C, 10°C, 15°C, 20°C, 25°C, and 30°C. You count the number of heartbeats/sec in each case.
Temperature is the independent variable (you are manipulating it), and number of heartbeats/sec is the dependent
variable (you observe how it changes in response to different temperatures).
You design an experiment to investigate the effect of exercise on pulse rate and blood pressure. The physiological
conditions (independent variable, or variable you manipulate) include sitting, exercising, and recovering at various
intervals following exercise. You make two kinds of measurements (two dependent variables) to evaluate the effect
of the physiological conditions—pulse rate and blood pressure.
2. Describe the experimental treatment. The experimental treatment (or treatments) is the various values that you
assign to the independent variable. The experimental treatments
