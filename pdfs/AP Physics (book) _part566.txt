4. Earth is not quite an inertial frame. We often make 
measurements in a reference frame fixed on the Earth,
assuming Earth is an inertial reference frame [Section 4–2].
But the Earth rotates, so this assumption is not quite valid.
Show that this assumption is off by 3 parts in 1000 by calcu-
lating the acceleration of an object at Earth’s equator due to
Earth’s daily rotation, and compare to  
the
acceleration due to gravity.
5. A certain white dwarf star was once an average star like
our Sun. But now it is in the last stage of its evolution and
is the size of our Moon but has the mass of our Sun.
(a) Estimate the acceleration due to gravity on the surface
of this star. (b) How much would a 65-kg person weigh on
this star? Give as a percentage of the person’s weight on
Earth. (c) What would be the speed of a baseball dropped
from a height of 1.0 m when it hit the surface?
