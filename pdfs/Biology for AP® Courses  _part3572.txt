es in the tracheal system are made of a polymeric material called chitin.
Insect bodies have openings, called spiracles, along the thorax and abdomen. These openings connect to the tubular network,
allowing oxygen to pass into the body (Figure 30.6) and regulating the diffusion of CO2 and water vapor. Air enters and
leaves the tracheal system through the spiracles. Some insects can ventilate the tracheal system with body movements.

Figure 30.6 Insects perform respiration via a tracheal system.
Mammalian Systems
In mammals, pulmonary ventilation occurs via inhalation (breathing). During inhalation, air enters the body through the
nasal cavity located just inside the nose (Figure 30.7). As air passes through the nasal cavity, the air is warmed to body
temperature and humidified. The respiratory tract is coated with mucus to seal the tissues from direct contact with air
