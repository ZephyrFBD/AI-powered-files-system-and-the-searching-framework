 resemble living prokaryotic cells.
c.
The fossil superficially resembles living microbial mats that exist today.
d.
Scientists found fossilized prokaryotic cells in the rock that are able to grow and divide.
Most prokaryotes have a peptidoglycan cell wall and many have a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 4.5). The cell wall acts
as an extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to
attach to surfaces in its environment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion.
Pili are used to exchange genetic material during a type of reproduction called conjugation. Fimbriae are used by bacteria
to attach to a host cell.

The most effective action anyone can take to prevent the spread of contagious illnesses is to wash his or
her hands. Why? Because microbes (organisms so tiny that they can only be seen with microscopes) are
ubiquitous. They li
