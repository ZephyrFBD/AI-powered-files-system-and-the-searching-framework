ing equilibrium 
constants: We tabulate initial concentrations or partial pressures, changes in those con-
centrations or pressures, and final equilibrium concentrations or partial pressures. Usu-
ally, we end up using the equilibrium-constant expression to derive an equation that 
must be solved for an unknown quantity, as demonstrated in Sample Exercise 15.10.
At 448 °C, the equilibrium constant Kc for the reaction
H21g2 + I21g2 ∆ 2 HI1g2
is 50.5. Predict in which direction the reaction proceeds to reach equilibrium if we start with 2.0 * 10-2 mol of HI, 
1.0 * 10-2 mol of H2, and 3.0 * 10-2 mol of I2 in a 2.00-L container.

 Predicting the Direction of Approach to Equilibrium
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given a volume and initial molar amounts of the 
species in a reaction and asked to determine in which direction 
the reaction must proceed to achieve equilibrium.
Plan We can determine the starting concentration of each species 
in the reaction mixture. We can then s
