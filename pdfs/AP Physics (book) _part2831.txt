perties (Chapter 27) and that their wavelengths can be
very small. The wave nature of electrons is utilized in the electron microscope
(Section 27–9), which can magnify 100 to 1000 times more than a visible-light
microscope because of the much shorter wavelengths. X-rays, too, have very short
wavelengths and are often used to study objects in great detail (Section 25–11).
25–9 Resolution of the Human Eye
and Useful Magnification
The resolution of the human eye is limited by several factors, all of roughly the
same order of magnitude. The resolution is best at the fovea, where the cone
spacing is smallest, about 
The diameter of the pupil varies
from about 0.1 cm to about 0.8 cm. So for 
(where the eye’s sensi-
tivity is greatest), the diffraction limit is about 
to
The eye is about 2 cm long, giving a resolving power (Eq. 25–8) of
at best, to about 
at worst (pupil
small). Spherical and chromatic aberration also limit the resolution to about 
The net result is that the eye can just res
