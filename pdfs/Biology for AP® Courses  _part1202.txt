44. Many biological processes are synchronized with the
24-hour rotational period of Earth. Circadian (24-hour)
periodicity is common across phyla. One of these
processes is the cell cycle. The currently accepted
explanation is that the low-oxygen atmosphere of early
Earth had no ozone layer to filter out the solar ultraviolet
radiation that damages DNA. Completing the S phase of
the cell cycle at night provided a selective advantage. The
internal clock controlling the cell cycle and the circadian
clock became synchronized. Research has demonstrated
that changes in one clock, either the circadian clock or the
cell cycle clock, disrupt timing in the other. The question
was, which clock controls the other?
