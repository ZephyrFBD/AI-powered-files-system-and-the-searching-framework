s 
of complexes were more fully understood, it became possible to name them in a more 
systematic manner. Let’s use two substances to illustrate how coordination compounds 
are named:
[Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2
Pentaamminechlorocobalt(III)
Cation
Cobalt in
+3 oxidation
state
Cl−
ligand
5 NH3
ligands
Chloride
Anion
Na2[MoOCl4]
Sodium
Cation
Molybdenum
in +4 oxidation
state
4 Cl−
ligands
Oxide, O2−

Tetrachlorooxomolybdate(IV)
Anion
How to Name Coordination Compounds
 
1. In naming complexes that are salts, the name of the cation is given 
before the name of the anion. Thus, in 3Co(NH3)5Cl4Cl2 we name the 
3Co(NH3)5Cl42+ cation and then the Cl-.
 
2. In naming complex ions or molecules, the ligands are named before 
the metal. Ligands are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their 
charges. Prefixes that give the number of ligands are not considered 
part of the ligand name in determining alphabetical order. Thus, the 
3Co(NH3)5Cl42+ ion is pentaamminechlorocobalt(III). (Be careful to
