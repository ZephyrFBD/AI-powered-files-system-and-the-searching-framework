 by using DPIP as a substitute for
NADP+. Oxidized DPIP (the lower energy state of DPIP) is blue, and reduced DPIP (the higher energy state of
DPIP) is clear. Various wavelengths of light are used to illuminate samples that contain chloroplasts, DPIP, and an
appropriate buffer. The results of the experiment are shown here.
8. Which of the following is a reasonable interpretation of
the results?
A. All wavelengths of light are equally absorbed and utilized during photosynthesis.
B. Blue (at 450 nm) is the most efficient wavelength for photosynthesis.
C. There are at least two wavelengths of light utilized during photosynthesis.
D. A blue solution indicates maximum photosynthetic activity.
Questions 9-10 refer to an experiment designed to measure the respiratory rate of crickets. Three respirometers are
prepared as follows.
Table 17-3
All respirometers (consisting of a syringe connected to a capillary tube) are immersed in the same water bath. One
end of the pipette is connected to the j
