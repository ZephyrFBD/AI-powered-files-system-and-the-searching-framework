25. A new mutation that arose in one copy of gene X 
in a somatic cell resulted in the formation of a 
tumor. Which of the following pieces of evidence 
best describes how the new mutation directly 
caused the tumor? 
(A) Protein X normally stimulates cell division, 
and the mutation created an overactive 
version of protein X. 
(B) Protein X normally activates a growth 
hormone receptor, and the mutation 
decreased the stability of protein X. 
(C) Protein X normally prevents passage through 
the cell cycle, and the mutation created an 
overactive version of protein X. 
(D) Protein X normally regulates gene 
expression, and the mutation created an 
underactive version of protein X that 
blocked the cell cycle.
