 to correlate species loss with habitat loss by measuring
forest-area loss and understanding species-area relationships. The species-area relationship is the rate at which new species
are seen when the area surveyed is increased. Studies have shown that the number of species present increases as the size of
the island increases. This phenomenon has also been shown to hold true in other habitats as well. Turning this relationship
around, if the habitat area is reduced, the number of species living there will also decline. Estimates of extinction rates based
on habitat loss and species-area relationships have suggested that with about 90 percent habitat loss an expected 50 percent
of species would become extinct. Species-area estimates have led to species extinction rate calculations of about 1000 E/
MSY and higher. In general, actual observations do not show this amount of loss and suggestions have been made that there
is a delay in extinction. Recent work has also called into question
