force acts, and by what object that force is exerted.
Only forces acting on a given object can be included
in  
for that object.
3. Newton’s second law involves vectors, and it is usu-
ally important to resolve vectors into components.
Choose x and y axes in a way that simplifies the
calculation. For example, it often saves work if you
choose one coordinate axis to be in the direction of
the acceleration (if known).
4. For each object, apply Newton’s second law to the 
x and y components separately. That is, the x compo-
nent of the net force on that object is related to 
the x component of that object’s acceleration:
and similarly for the y direction.
5. Solve the equation or equations for the unknown(s).
Put in numerical values only at the end, and keep
track of units.
