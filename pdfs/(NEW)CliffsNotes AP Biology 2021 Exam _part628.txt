9. Insight occurs when an animal, exposed to a new situation and without any prior relevant experience, performs a
behavior that generates a desirable outcome.
A chimpanzee will stack boxes so it can climb them, providing it with access to bananas previously beyond reach.

only after the bird has physically matured.
In general, inher
