the loss of water from a leaf. The theory of
transpiration-pull–cohesion tension explains how water and nutrients
get “pulled” upward in the xylem tissue of a plant, from the roots,
without the plant’s cells having to expend any energy. According to
this theory, as one molecule of water evaporates from the stomate of
a leaf, another molecule of water is pulled into the plant through the
roots.
Explain how transpiration is dependent on the
structure/properties of water, referencing TWO of water’s
properties in your response. You may use illustrations in your
explanation, but they must be labeled, and they do not
substitute for a written explanation. (2 points)
Identify an experimental procedure that would involve the use
of green plants and demonstrate differences in the rates of
transpiration in TWO different environmental conditions.
Describe how you would collect quantitative data. (4 points)
Analyze your data. Explain how you would decide (based on
your data) whether the environment
