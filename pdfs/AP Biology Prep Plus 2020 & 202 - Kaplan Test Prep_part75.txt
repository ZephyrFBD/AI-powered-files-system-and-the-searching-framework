 glycogen. Glycogen is hydrophilic and takes up
more space. Thus, determining whether the unknown molecules are
hydrophobic or hydrophilic and ascertaining their energy density
would be suﬀicient to distinguish between the two types of
compounds. (B) is correct. (A) is incorrect because both types of
compounds contain oxygen. (C) is incorrect because both types of
compounds can be found in skeletal muscle. Even though knowing the
molar mass of an unknown substance can help to identify it, (D) is
incorrect because determining the mass of the material would be
insuﬀicient without also knowing the number of moles present.

Reduction is the gain of electrons whereas oxidation is the loss of
electrons. (You can also think of oxidation as an increase in the
number of bonds to oxygen and reduction as a decrease in the number
of bonds to oxygen.) During photosynthesis, electrons are given oﬀ
from water and accepted by derivatives of carbon dioxide. This results
in t
