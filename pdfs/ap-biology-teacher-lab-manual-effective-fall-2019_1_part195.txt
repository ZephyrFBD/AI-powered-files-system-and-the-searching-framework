e selected population of plants. Record the data in your lab notebook. 
Once you have finished, isolate these selected plants from the rest of the population. 
Move the bottles of selected plants to another light system so that the plants can finish 
out their life cycle in isolation. This population will serve as the parents for a new 
generation. 
Step 8 On about day 14–16, when several flowers are present on each of the selected

another plant. Collect and distribute pollen from every flower on every plant in the 
selected population. Reserve this bee stick for only the selected population. Avoid 
contaminating with the pollen from the remaining Fast Plants. Pollinate flowers in the 
selected population for the next three days with the same bee stick. Be sure to record
