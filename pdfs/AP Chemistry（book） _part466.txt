 LiOH b a 1 mol CO2
2 mol LiOH b a
44.01 g CO2
1 mol CO2
b
= 0.919 g CO2
Check Notice that 23.95 g LiOH>mol ≈24 g LiOH>mol,
 24 g LiOH>mol * 2 mol LiOH = 48 g LiOH, and 144 g CO2>mol2>
148 g LiOH2 is slightly less than 1. Thus, the magnitude of our answer, 
0.919 g CO2, is reasonable based on the amount of starting LiOH. The 
number of significant figures and units are also appropriate.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Propane, C3H8 (Figure 3.8), is a common fuel used for cooking 
and home heating. What mass of O2 is consumed in the com-
bustion of 1.00 g of propane?  
(a) 5.00 g (b) 0.726 g (c) 2.18 g (d) 3.63 g
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Methanol, CH3OH, reacts with oxygen from air in a com-
bustion reaction to form water and carbon dioxide. What 
mass of water is produced in the combustion of 23.6 g of 
methanol?
