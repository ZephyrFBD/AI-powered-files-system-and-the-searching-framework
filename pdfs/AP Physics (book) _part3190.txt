areas. The precise straightness of a laser beam is also useful
to surveyors for lining up equipment accurately, especially in inaccessible places.
28–12 Holography
One of the most interesting applications of laser light is the production of three-
dimensional images called holograms (see Fig. 28–23). In an ordinary photograph,
the film simply records the intensity of light reaching it at each point. When the
photograph or transparency is viewed, light reflecting from it or passing through
it gives us a two-dimensional picture. In holography, the images are formed by
interference, without lenses. A laser hologram is typically made on a photographic
emulsion (film). A broadened laser beam is split into two parts by a half-silvered
mirror, Fig. 28–24. One part goes directly to the film; the rest passes to the object
to be photographed, from which it is reflected to the film. Light from every point
on the object reaches each point on the film, and the interference of the two
beams allows t
