28. (II) Calculate the true mass (in vacuum) of a piece of alu-
minum whose apparent mass is 4.0000 kg when weighed 
in air.
29. (II) Because gasoline is less dense than water, drums con-
taining gasoline will float in water. Suppose a 210-L steel
drum is completely full of gasoline. What total volume of
steel can be used in making the drum if the gasoline-filled
drum is to float in fresh water?
30. (II) A scuba diver and her gear displace a volume of 69.6 L
and have a total mass of 72.8 kg. (a) What is the buoyant
force on the diver in seawater? (b) Will the diver sink or float?
31. (II) The specific gravity of ice is 0.917, whereas that of 
seawater is 1.025. What percent of an iceberg is above the
surface of the water?
32. (II) Archimedes’ principle can be used to determine
the specific gravity
