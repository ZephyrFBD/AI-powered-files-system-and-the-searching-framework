 acidâ€“strong base titration (Figure 17.7) in three noteworthy ways:
 1. The solution of the weak acid has a higher initial pH than a solution of a strong acid 
of the same concentration.
 2. The pH change in the rapid-rise portion of the curve near the equivalence point is 
smaller for the weak acid than for the strong acid.
 3. The pH at the equivalence point is above 7.00 for the weak acid titration.
Give It Some Thought
Describe the reasons why statement 3 above is true.
The weaker the acid, the more pronounced these differences become. To illustrate 
this consider the family of titration curves shown in Figure 17.11. Notice that as the 
acid becomes weaker (that is, as Ka becomes smaller), the initial pH increases and the 
pH change near the equivalence point becomes less marked. Furthermore, the pH at 
the equivalence point steadily increases as Ka decreases, because the strength of the 
conjugate base of the weak acid increases. It is virtually impossible to determine the 
equiva
