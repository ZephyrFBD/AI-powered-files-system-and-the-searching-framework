child were exposed to this substance over the long term! Beginning in
2012 and continuing to today, manufacturers no longer use BPA in baby
bottles and children’s drinking cups.
TEMPERATURE REGULATION
Most life exists within a fairly narrow range, from 0°C (the temperature at
which water freezes) to about 50°C. Temperatures on land fluctuate
enormously. Therefore, temperature regulation, like water conservation,
became a problem for animals when they moved to the land. To stay alive,
animals must generate their own body heat, seek out a more suitable
climate, and/or change behavior. Here are some examples of behavioral
changes that alter body temperature:
A snake can warm itself in the sun or cool off by hiding under a
rock.
Animals on a cold winter prairie huddle together to decrease heat
loss.
Bees swarming in a hive raise the temperature inside the hive.
Dogs pant and sw
