he transmission
lines have a total resistance of 
Calculate the power loss if the power is
transmitted at (a) 240 V and (b) 24,000 V.
APPROACH We cannot use 
because if R is the resistance of the
transmission lines, we donâ€™t know the voltage drop along them. The given voltages
are applied across the lines plus the load (the town). But we can determine the
current I in the lines 
and then find the power loss from
for
both cases (a) and (b).
SOLUTION (a) If 120 kW is sent at 240 V, the total current will be
The power loss in the lines,
is then
Thus, over 80% of all the power would be wasted as heat in the power lines!
(b) If 120 kW is sent at 24,000 V, the total current will be
The power loss in the lines is then
which is less than
of 1%: a far better efficiency.
NOTE We see that the higher voltage results in less current, and thus less
power is wasted as heat in the transmission lines. It is for this reason that power
is usually transmitted at very high voltages, as high as 700 kV.
