etermine the protein's shape, size, and function. Each amino acid
is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond, known as a peptide bond, which is formed by a dehydration reaction.
The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the incoming amino acid combine, releasing a molecule of
water. The resulting bond is the peptide bond (Figure 3.26).
Figure 3.26 Peptide bond formation is a dehydration synthesis reaction. The carboxyl group of one amino acid is linked
to the amino group of the incoming amino acid. In the process, a molecule of water is released.
The products formed by such linkages are called peptides. As more amino acids join to this growing chain, the resulting
chain is known as a polypeptide. Each polypeptide has a free amino group at one end. This end is called the N terminal,
or the amino terminal, and the other end has a free carboxyl group, also known as the C or carboxyl terminal. While the
terms polypeptide and protein are sometimes used interchang
