bjects through an irre-
versible chemical process and cannot readily be reshaped. An elasto-
mer is a material that exhibits elastic behavior; that is, it returns to its 
original shape following stretching or bending.
In an addition polymerization reaction, the molecules form new 
linkages by opening existing p bonds. Polyethylene forms, for exam-
ple, when the carbonâ€“carbon double bonds of ethylene open up. In 
a condensation polymerization reaction, the monomers are joined by 
eliminating a small molecule between them. The various kinds of ny-
lon are formed, for example, by removing a water molecule between 
an amine and a carboxylic acid. A polymer formed from two different 
monomers is called a copolymer.

Polymers are largely amorphous, but some materials possess a 
degree of crystallinity. For a given chemical composition, the crystal-
linity depends on the molecular weight and the degree of branching 
along the main polymer chain. Polymer properties are als
