 3. β-hemoglobin is a highly conserved protein among vertebrates. The identity of amino acid 104–one of the 
variable amino acids in the polypeptide–in four vertebrate species is shown in the table above.  
A student constructed the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 1 by comparing the amino acid sequences of  
β-hemoglobin in the four species. The student placed “Lys” at an incorrect position on the phylogenetic tree  
in an attempt to s
