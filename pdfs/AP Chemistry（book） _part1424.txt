an 
in compounds with C ¬C single bonds (1.54 Å), consistent with the presence of a 
stronger C “C double bond. Second, all six atoms in C2H4 lie in the same plane. The 
p orbitals on each C atom that make up the p bond can achieve a good overlap only 
when the two CH2 fragments lie in the same plane. Because p bonds require that por-
tions of a molecule be planar, they can introduce rigidity into molecules.
Triple bonds can also be explained using hybrid orbitals. Acetylene 1C2H22, for exam-
ple, is a linear molecule containing a triple bond: H¬C ‚C ¬H. The linear geometry 
suggests that each carbon atom uses sp hybrid orbitals to form s bonds with the other car-
bon and one hydrogen. Each carbon atom thus has two unhybridized 2p orbitals at right 
angles to each other and to the axis of the sp hybrid set (Figure 9.23). Thus, there are two p 
orbitals remaining on an sp-hybridized carbon atom. These p orbitals overlap to form a pair 
of p bonds. The triple bond in acetylene therefore
