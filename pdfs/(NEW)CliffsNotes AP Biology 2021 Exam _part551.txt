 remains in the capillaries and returns to the heart through venules, which merge to form larger veins.
The heart then pumps the deoxygenated blood to the respiratory organ (gills or lungs), where arteries again branch
into a capillary bed for gas exchange. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through veins. From here, the
oxygenated blood is pumped, once again, throughout the body.
In the human heart, blood moves through the following structures, in the following order (Figure 13-2):
 
Figure 13-2
1. Right atrium. Deoxygenated blood enters this chamber on the right side of the heart through two veins, the upper
superior vena cava and the lower inferior vena cava. (Right and left refer to the right and left sides of the body.)
2. Right ventricle. Blood moves through the right atrioventricular valve (or AV valve, also called the tricuspid
valve) and enters the right ventricle. The ventricles, with walls thicker and more muscular than those of the atria,
contract and pump the b
