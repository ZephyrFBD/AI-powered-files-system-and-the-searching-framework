FIGURE 24–51 (a) “Twisted” form
of liquid crystal. Light polarization
plane is rotated 90°, and so is
transmitted by the horizontal
polarizer. Only one line of molecules
is shown. (b) Molecules disoriented
by electric field. The plane of
polarization is not changed, so light
does not pass through the horizontal
polarizer. (The transparent electrodes
are not shown.)

FIGURE 24–49 Example of an
image made up of many small
squares or pixels (picture elements).
FIGURE 24–50 Liquid crystal molecules
tend to align in one dimension
(parallel to each other) but have
random positions (left-right, up-down).
†Some displays use an opposite system: the polarizers are parallel to each other (the scratches remain
at 90° to maintain the twist). Then voltage off results in black
