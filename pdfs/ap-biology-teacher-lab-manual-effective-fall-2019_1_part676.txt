 these graphs in your lab 
notebook and prepare more finished copies for your mini-poster presentation when you 
complete this lab. If you use bar graphs for illustrating the means, standard error bars 
should be included to display the range of the data. In your notebook (and mini-poster 
presentation), describe the data and their presentation. Follow that with conclusions 
that you can support with your data about energy capture and flow in this artificial lab 
community. 
â–  Designing and Conducting Your Investigation 
In the previous procedures, you began to develop your skills by applying methods to the 
problem of energy capture and flow in an ecosystem. You were encouraged to note and 
record questions about this system as you worked through the investigation. Now it is 
time to select one of those questions, propose your hypothesis, design your investigation, 
and carry it out. Be sure to connect your work to your overall understanding of energy 
and ecosystems.
