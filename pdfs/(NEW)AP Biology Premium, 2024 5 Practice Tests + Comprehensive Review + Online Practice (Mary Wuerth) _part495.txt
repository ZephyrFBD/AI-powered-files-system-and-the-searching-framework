ic
tree do not possess. Lampreys are the least closely related member of this phylogenetic tree and represent the
outgroup in this example.
Phylogenetic trees and cladograms can also show speciation events (the evolution of new species) and extinction
events (the death of all members of a species), as shown in Figure 21.2.
Figure 21.2 Phylogenetic Tree Showing Speciation and Extinction Events
In Figure 21.2, points 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent speciation events that led to one ancestral lineage giving rise to
two or more daughter lineages. Species B and D represent extinct species that did not survive to the present time,
while A, C, E, and F represent extant species that have members that survived to the present time.
Organisms are linked by lines of descent, with a proposed common ancestor for all forms of life on Earth (LUCA
â€”last universal common ancestor) estimated to have existed about 3.5 billion years ago. There are two major
theories about how life on Earth originated:
