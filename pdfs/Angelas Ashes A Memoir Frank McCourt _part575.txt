 
 they go on.Here he is pushing the bicycle and puffing away on the pipe 
 
 in his mouth. He tells me climb up on the bar of his bike and off we go 
 
 to my first job as a man. His head is over mine on the bike and the smell 
 
 of the pipe is lovely.There’s a coal smell on his clothes and that makes 
 
 me sneeze. 
 
 Men are walking or cycling toward the coal yards and Rank’s Flour 
 
 Mills and the Limerick Steamship Company on the Dock Road. Mr. 
 
 Hannon takes his pipe from his mouth and tells me this is the best 
 
 morning of all, Saturday, half day.We’ll start at eight and be finished by 
 
 the time the Angelus rings at twelve. 
 
 First we get the horse ready, give him a bit of a rub, fill the wooden 
 
  
  
 tub with oats and the bucket with water.Mr. Hannon shows me how 
 
 to put on the harness and lets me back the horse into the shafts of the 
 
 float. He says, Jaysus, Frankie, you have the knack of it. 
 
 That makes me so happy I want to jump up and down and drive
