 2. GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) is an enzyme that catalyzes 
the sixth step in glycolysis, an important reaction that produces molecules used 
in cellular respiration. The following data table shows the percentage similarity of 
this gene and the protein it expresses in humans versus other species. For example, 
according to the table, the GAPDH gene in chimpanzees is 99.6% identical to the 
gene found in humans, while the protein is identical.

a. Why is the percentage similarity in the gene always lower than the percentage 
similarity in the protein for each of the species? (Hint: Recall how a ge
