ations like dams, to create energy or store water; levees, to prevent flooding; or dredging or rerouting, to create land
that is more suitable for human development. Many fish species in the United States, especially rare species or species with
restricted distributions, have seen declines caused by river damming and habitat loss. Research has confirmed that species
of amphibians that must carry out parts of their life cycles in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats have a greater chance of
suffering population declines and extinction because of the increased likelihood that one of their habitats or access between
them will be lost.
Overharvesting
Overharvesting is a serious threat to many species, but particularly to aquatic species. There are many examples of regulated
commercial fisheries monitored by fisheries scientists that have nevertheless collapsed. The western Atlantic cod fishery
is the most spectacular recent collapse. While it was a hugely productive fishery for 400 years,
