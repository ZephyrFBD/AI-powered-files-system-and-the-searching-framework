t on this thin film does 
not reflect at the top part of the film, so the top is transparent and we see the
background which is black.
Below the black area at the top, there is a thin blue line, and then a white
band. The film has thickened to perhaps 75 to 100 nm, so the shortest wavelength
(blue) light begins to partially interfere constructively. But just below, where the
thickness is slightly greater (100 nm), the path difference is reasonably close to
for much of the spectrum and we see white or silver.†
Immediately below the white band in this Figure we see a brown band, where
200 nm, and many wavelengths (not all) are close to —and those colors destruc-
tively interfere, leaving only a few colors to partially interfere constructively,
giving us murky brown.
