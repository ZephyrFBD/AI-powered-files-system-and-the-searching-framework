nates in the mutation of DNA in an
organism’s genome. For a mutation to have an impact on evolution, it
must occur in a gamete and be passed on to oﬀspring. If a mutation
occurs in a gamete that forms a zygote, the oﬀspring will inherit that
mutation and pass it on to its oﬀspring. Genetic variation can also occur
during recombination in meiosis I. Most mutations are harmful, but
trees because of its long beak, it will be more likely to survive and
provide more food for its oﬀspring. If beak length is a result of
genetics, that bird’s oﬀspring are more likely to have long beaks, and
the following generations of oﬀspring are more likely to have long
beaks, until every bird in the population has a long beak.
occasionally a mutation exists in viable oﬀspring. These oﬀspring may
then exhibit a phenotype that diﬀers from the rest of the population.

Variation that occurs in a population will have a distribution
