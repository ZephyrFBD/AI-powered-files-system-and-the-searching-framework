d from individual amino acids, respectively.
Reactants within a closed system will undergo chemical reactions in both directions until a state of equilibrium is reached.
This state of equilibrium is one of the lowest possible free energy and a state of maximal entropy. Energy must be put
into the system to push the reactants and products away from a state of equilibrium. Either reactants or products must

be added, removed, or changed. If a cell were a closed system, its chemical reactions would reach equilibrium, and it
would die because there would be insufficient free energy left to perform the work needed to maintain life. In a living
cell, chemical reactions are constantly moving towards equilibrium, but never reach it. This is because a living cell is an
open system. Materials pass in and out, the cell recycles the products of certain chemical reactions into other reactions,
