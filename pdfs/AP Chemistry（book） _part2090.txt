lower solute concentration into the one with a higher solute concentration. In this process, 
called osmosis, the net movement of solvent is always toward the solution with the lower solvent 
(higher solute) concentration, as if the solutions were driven to attain equal concentrations.
Figure 13.22 shows the osmosis that occurs between an aqueous solution and pure 
water, separated by a semipermeable membrane. The U-tube contains water on the left 
and an aqueous solution on the right. Initially, there is a net movement of water through 
the membrane from left to right, leading to unequal liquid levels in the two arms of the 
U-tube. Eventually, at equilibrium (middle panel of Figure 13.22), the pressure difference 
resulting from the unequal liquid heights becomes so large that the net flow of water 
ceases. This pressure, which stops osmosis, is the osmot
