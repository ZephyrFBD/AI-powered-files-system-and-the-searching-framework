8.23 Cichlid fish from Lake Apoyeque, Nicaragua, show evidence of sympatric speciation. Lake Apoyeque,
a crater lake, is 1800 years old, but genetic evidence indicates that the lake was populated only 100 years ago by a
single population of cichlid fish. Nevertheless, two populations with distinct morphologies and diets now exist in the
lake, and scientists believe these populations may be in an early stage of speciation.

18.3 | Reconnection and Rates of Speciation
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are the pathways of species evolution in hybrid zones?
•
What are the two major theories on rates of speciation?
Connection for AP® Courses
Speciation can both occur gradually over time in small steps or in bursts of change known as punctuated equilibrium.
With punctuated equilibrium, a species may remain unchanged for long periods o
