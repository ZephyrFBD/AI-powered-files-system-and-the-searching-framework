ould be able to manipulate the equation PV = nRT, where  
P = pressure of the gas  
V = volume of the gas  
n = number of molecules of the gas  
R = the gas constant (its value is fixed)  
T = temperature of the gas  
Students can be directed to several online resources to review the gas laws, including 
http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/labbench/lab5/intro.html, 
which offers activities to introduce key concepts pertaining to cellular respiration, and 
http://www.nclark.net/GasLaws, which provides myriad tutorials and animations to 
introduce or review the gas laws. 
This investigation reinforces the following skills. (However, if students have not 
acquired these skills previously, the procedures in this lab will help students develop 
them.) 
•  Preparing a constant temperature water bath 
•  Measuring volume and temperature using the metric system 
•  Constructing data tables and graphs 
•  Communicating results and conclusions 
■ Skills Development 
Students will devel
