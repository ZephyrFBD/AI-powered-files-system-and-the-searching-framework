According to Darwin’s theory of natural selection, individuals with
more favorable phenotypes are more likely to survive and pass those
traits on to subsequent generations. In the presence of antibiotics,
bacteria that exhibit greater antibiotic resistance (indicated by darker
shading) will be selected for, because those that lack resistance will be
killed by the antibiotics. The oﬀspring of those surviving bacteria will
inherit the resistance trait, giving the final population greater
resistance. The correct answer is (D). (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect
because in the presence of antibiotics, the bacteria with less resistance
will be killed by the antibiotics.

Water flows down a gradient of water potential from high (less
negative) to low (more negative). During transpiration, water flows
from the soil (–0.3 MPa) to the roots, then to the stem, then the leaves,
and finally evaporates into the atmo
