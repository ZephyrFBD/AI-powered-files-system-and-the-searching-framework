Question 4 
Figure 1. Membrane permeability to sodium and potassium ions 
during an action potential 
Figure 2. Membrane potential during an action potential 
A scientist studying the effect of a stimulus on a motor neuron observed that the permeability of the 
plasma membrane of the neuron changes during an action potential. The curves in Figure 1 represent 
the changes in permeability of the membrane to sodium ions (Na+) and potassium ions (K+) during the 
action potential. The graph in Figure 2 represents the changes in membrane potential during an action 
potential.
