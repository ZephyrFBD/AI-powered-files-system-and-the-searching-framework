and red light.
APPROACH We find the angles for violet and red light from the distances given
and the diagram of Fig. 24–10. Then we use Eq. 24–2a to obtain the wavelengths.
Because 3.5 mm is much less than 2.5 m, we can use the small-angle approximation.
SOLUTION We use Eq.24–2a 
with

the first-order fringe for green light
Coherence
The two slits in Figs. 24–6 and 24–7 act as if they were two sources of radiation.
They are called coherent sources because the waves leaving them have the same
wavelength and frequency, and bear the same phase relationship to each other at
all times. This happens because the waves come from a single source to the left 
of the two slits. An interference pattern is observed only when the sources are
coherent. If two tiny lightbulbs replaced the two slits, an interference pattern
would not be seen. T
