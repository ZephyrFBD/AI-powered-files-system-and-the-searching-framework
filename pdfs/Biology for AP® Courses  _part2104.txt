wide
stromatolite fossils show a decline between 1 and 1.3
billion years ago.
73. In 1952, the Miller-Urey experiment showed that an
electrical discharge in a gas-phase mixture of ammonia,
hydrogen, methane, and water produced five amino acids.
When the experiment was conducted, evidence indicated
that this mixture was representative of the Hadean (early
Earth) atmosphere. The experiment was repeated in the
presence of jets of hot steam, simulating Hadean volcanic
eruptions and producing an even larger variety of amino
acids.
A. Consider the following criticisms of the “organic soup”
model and justify the selection of data that other
experiments might provide regarding the origin of life on
Earth.
•
Biopolymers on Earth have a left-hand symmetry at
the carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid carbon, and
these experiments produced mixtures of both left-
and right-hand symmetries.
•
No peptide bonds between amino acids were
observed.
•
Early Earth’s atmospheric oxygen concentration is
