oportion of genes expressed
during development than workers as they have a relatively
simple lifestyle that does not require leaving the hive
regularly.
(B)
Workers may need to express a higher proportion of genes
related to sensory organs to allow them to respond to a
variety of stimuli while foraging.
(C)
Queens may need a wider range of metabolic functions

4. Honeybees have two female castes, workers and queens, which
are phenotypically very diï¬€erent. Researchers have discovered
that feeding bee larvae a diet rich in a protein called royalactin
increases the amount of juvenile hormone that they produce.
Higher hormone levels result in the development of queen bee
characteristics. However, they have also discovered that feeding
royalactin to fruit flies causes similar phenotypic changes. What is
the most reasonable explanation for this finding?
