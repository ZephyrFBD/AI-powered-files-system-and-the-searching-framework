vels of oxygen and carbon dioxide gas over time. One chamber was kept at a temperature of 4°
Celsius, and the other chamber was kept at a temperature of 25° Celsius for the duration of the experiment.
19. What is the independent variable in this experiment?
(A) the number of germinating mung beans
(B) the temperature of the chambers
(C) the amount of carbon dioxide produced
(D) the amount of oxygen consumed
20. This graph shows the carbon dioxide levels in both chambers during a 30-minute period.
Which of the following correctly states the results of this experiment?
(A) The mung beans at 4° Celsius increased the level of carbon dioxide in the chamber at a rate of 6.67 ppm
CO2 per minute and had a higher respiration rate than the mung beans at 25° Celsius.
(B) The mung beans at 4° Celsius increased the level of carbon dioxide in the chamber at a rate of 1.67 ppm
CO2 per minute and had a higher respiration rate than the mung beans at 25° Celsius.
(C) The mung beans at 25° Celsius increa
