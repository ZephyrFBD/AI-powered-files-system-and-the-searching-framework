of respiration is more technically challenging than many lab 
procedures because there are many places for potential error in the assembly and 
use of equipment. The advantages of the microrespirometer method as described by 
Richard E. Lee in American Biology Teacher include low cost, reliability, simplicity, and 
rapid response. However, for the sake of convenience, the procedure is outlined below. 
Hint: Read each step before doing it! You need to assemble two microrespirometers: one 
for measuring the rate of respiration in germinating seeds and the other for the control. 
Step 1 Plug in the hot glue gun and allow it to heat up. 
Step 2 Take a tuberculin syringe (without a needle) and make sure that its plunger is 
pushed all the way in. 
Step 3 Carefully insert a 40 ÂµL plastic capillary tube into the syringe where the needle 
normally would be. Insert it as far as the plunger tip but no farther. This will help prevent 
the capillary from becoming plugged with glue. 
Step 4 While h
