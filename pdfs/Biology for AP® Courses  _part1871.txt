 determined the genetic
basis of that phenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask: "What does
this gene or DNA element do?" This technique, called reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classic genetic

methodology. This method would be similar to damaging a body part to determine its function. An insect that loses a wing
cannot fly, which means that the function of the wing is flight. The classical genetic method would compare insects that
cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observe that the non-flying insects have lost wings. Similarly, mutating or deleting
genes provides researchers with clues about gene function. The methods used to disable gene function are collectively called
gene targeting. Gene targeting is the use of recombinant DNA vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene, either
