t you
collect. (Think â€œdata is for the dependent variable.) The dependent variable measures how the experiment is
responding to the independent variable that you have chosen to investigate.
If you are plotting the progress of an event, then you have chosen time as the independent variable and the data you
collect that measure changes in the event (such as weight change, distance traveled, or carbon dioxide released) are
represented by the dependent variable.
4. Connect the plotted points. Either connect the plotted points with straight lines or draw a straight line through
the plotted points estimating the line of best fit. Avoid smooth curves, as they usually imply knowledge about
intermediate points not plotted or a mathematical equation that fits the experimental results. If the question asks you
to make predictions beyond the data actually graphed, extrapolate, or extend, the plotted line with a different line
form (for example, dotted or dashed).
