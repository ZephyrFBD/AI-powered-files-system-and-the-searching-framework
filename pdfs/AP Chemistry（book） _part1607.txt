f the molecules is proportional to the absolute temperature. At any given 
temperature, the molecules of all gases have the same average kinetic energy.
The kinetic-molecular theory explains both pressure and temperature at the 
molecular level. The pressure of a gas is caused by collisions of the molecules with the 
walls of the container (Figure 10.11). The magnitude of the pressure is determined by 
how often and how forcefully the molecules strike the walls.
The absolute temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its 
molecules. If two gases are at the same temperature, their molecules have the same 
average kinetic energy (statement 5 of the kinetic-molecular theory). If the absolute 
temperature of a gas is doubled, the average kinetic energy of its molecules doubles. 
Thus, molecular motion increases with increasing temperature.
