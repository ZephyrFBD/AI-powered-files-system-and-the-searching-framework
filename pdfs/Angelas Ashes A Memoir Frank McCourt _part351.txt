he Shannon for their holidays and then they go back to the warm places, 
 
 maybe even India.He says he’ll write me a letter when he’s over there and 
 
 I can come to India and have my own girl with a red dot. 
 
 What’s that dot for, Paddy? 
 
 It shows they’re high class, the quality. 
 
 But, Paddy,would the quality in India talk to you if they knew you 
 
 were from a lane in Limerick and had no shoes? 
 
 Course they would, but the English quality wouldn’t.The English 
 
 quality wouldn’t give you the steam of their piss. 
 
 Steam of their piss? God, Paddy, did you think of that yourself ? 
 
 Naw, naw, that’s what my father says below in the bed when he’s 
 
 coughin’ up the gobs and blamin’ the English for everything. 
 
 And I think, Steam of their piss. I’ll keep that for myself. I’ll go 
 
 around Limerick saying it, Steam of their piss, Steam of their piss, and 
 
 when I go to America some day I’ll be the only one who knows it.
