f a homogeneous mixture of ethanol 1C2H5OH2 and 
paraffin, which has an average formula of C24H50. What 
mass of C2H5OH should be added to 620 kg of the paraffin 
to produce 8 torr of ethanol vapor pressure at 35 째C? The 
vapor pressure of pure ethanol at 35 째C is 100 torr.
 13.100  A solution contains 0.115 mol H2O and an unknown num-
ber of moles of sodium chloride. The vapor pressure of the 
solution at 30 째C is 25.7 torr. The vapor pressure of pure 
water at this temperature is 31.8 torr. Calculate the num-
ber of grams of sodium chloride in the solution. (Hint: Re-
member that sodium chloride is a strong electrolyte.)
 13.101 Two beakers are placed in a sealed box at 25 째C. One beaker 
contains 30.0 mL of a 0.050 M aqueous solution of a non-
volatile nonelectrolyte. The other beaker contains 30.0 mL 
of a 0.035 M aqueous solution of NaCl. The water vapor 
from the two solutions reaches equilibrium. (a) In which 
beaker does the solution level rise, and in which one does 
it fall?
