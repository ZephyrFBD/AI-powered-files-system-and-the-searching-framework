al pesticide is used to reduce the aphid populations. One week after the treatments are
applied, 10 measurements of the density of the aphid populations (in aphids per square decimeter) are taken in
each section of the garden. The means and the 95% confidence intervals for each section of the garden are
shown in the graph.
(a) Based on the graph, identify the section of the garden with the least variability in aphid density and the
section of the garden with the most variability in aphid density one week after treatment.
(b) Analyze the data shown in the graph to determine which sections of the garden are most likely to have a
statistically significant difference in aphid density.
(c) In this experiment, 10 measurements (n = 10) of the aphid density were taken in each section of the garden.
If 50 measurements (n = 50) were taken, make a prediction about the effect, if any, this would have on the
95% confidence intervals.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c) using your knowledge of
