from rest and rolls without slipping.
52. (II) A bowling ball of mass 7.25 kg and radius 10.8 cm rolls
without slipping down a lane at 
Calculate its total
kinetic energy.
53. (II) Estimate the kinetic energy of the Earth with respect
to the Sun as the sum of two terms, (a) that due to its daily
rotation about its axis, and (b) that due to its yearly revolu-
tion about the Sun. [Assume the Earth is a uniform sphere
with 
and is
from the Sun.]
54. (II) A rotating uniform cylindrical platform of mass 220 kg
and radius 5.5 m slows down from 
to rest in 16 s
when the driving motor is disconnected. Estimate the power
output of the motor (hp) required to maintain a steady
speed of 
55. (II) A merry-go-round has a mass of 1440 kg and a radius
of 7.50 m. How much net work is required to accelerate it
from rest to a rotation rate of 1.00 revolution per 7.00 s?
Assume it is a solid cylinder.
