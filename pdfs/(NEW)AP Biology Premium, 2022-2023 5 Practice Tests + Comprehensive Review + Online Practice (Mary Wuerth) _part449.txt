ps in the desert of the southwestern
United States. Some rock pocket mice have light-colored fur, while others have dark-colored fur. A population
of rock pocket mice lives in a desert with both light-colored sand dunes and dark-colored rocks. Owls and
hawks prey on the rock pocket mice they see. The initial ratio of light-colored to dark-colored mice in this
population is approximately 1:1. A sandstorm occurs in the habitat of this population of rock pocket mice, and
it covers all of the habitat in a thick layer of light-colored sand. Predict the most likely effect of this on the rock
pocket mouse population.
(A) The relative frequency of dark-colored rock pocket mice would increase.
(B) The relative frequency of light-colored rock pocket mice would increase.
(C) The numbers of both dark-colored and light-colored rock pocket mice would decrease.
(D) The numbers of both dark-colored and light-colored rock pocket mice would increase.
