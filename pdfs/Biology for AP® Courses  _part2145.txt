 selection pressure, or driving selective force, were the only one acting on the population. In other
examples, better camouflage or a stronger resistance to drought might pose a selection pressure.
Another way a population’s allele and genotype frequencies can change is genetic drift (Figure 19.4), which is simply the
effect of chance. By chance, some individuals will have more offspring than others—not due to an advantage conferred
by some genetically-encoded trait, but just because one male happened to be in the right place at the right time (when the
receptive female walked by) or because the other one happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time (when a fox was
hunting).

Figure 19.4 Genetic drift occurs when the gene frequency of a population shifts by random chance (i.e. without a
selective pressure). Over time, genetic drift can completely eliminate an allele from the population. For example,
in the first generation here, the
