r use in hydro-
gen bomb production. The lithium metal remaining after 
removal of 6Li was sold on the market. (a) What are the 
compositions of the nuclei of 6Li and 7Li? (b) The atomic 
masses of 6Li and 7Li are 6.015122 and 7.016004 amu, re-
spectively. A sample of lithium depleted in the lighter iso-
tope was found on analysis to contain 1.442% 6Li. What is 
the average atomic weight of this sample of the metal?
 2.94 The element oxygen has three naturally occurring isotopes, with 
8, 9, and 10 neutrons in the nucleus, respectively. (a) Write the 
full chemical symbols for these three isotopes. (b) Describe 
the similarities and differences between the three kinds of 
 
atoms of oxygen.
 2.95  The element lead (Pb) consists of four naturally occur-
ring isotopes with atomic masses 203.97302, 205.97444, 
206.97587, and 207.97663 amu. The relative abundances of 
these four isotopes are 1.4, 24.1, 22.1, and 52.4%, respec-
tively. From these data, calculate the atomic weight of lead.
