reasing intermo-
lecular attraction, from least to most, for this series of 
compounds. (c) Predict the critical temperature and pres-
sure for CCl4 based on the trends in this table. Look up 
the experimentally determined critical temperatures and 
pressures for CCl4, using a source such as the CRC Hand-
book of Chemistry and Physics, and suggest a reason for any 
discrepancies.
Vapor Pressure (Section 11.5)
 11.49  Which of the following affects the vapor pressure of a liq-
uid? (a) Volume of the liquid, (b) surface area, (c) intermo-
lecular attractive forces, (d) temperature, (e) density of the 
liquid.
 11.50  Acetone 1H3CCOCH32 has a boiling point of 56 °C. Based on 
the data given in Figure 11.25, would you expect acetone to 
have a higher or lower vapor pressure than ethanol at 25 °C?
 11.51  (a) Place the following substances in order of increasing 
volatility: CH4, CBr4, CH2Cl2, CH3Cl, CHBr3, and CH2Br2. 
(b) How do the boiling points vary through this series? 
 
(c) Explain
