 and has fewer (two to three) stripes on his abdomen. The posterior end of the
abdomen is rounded and heavily pigmented (as if two or three stripes have fused). A male also has a small bundle of
black hairs, or sex combs, on the uppermost joint of his front legs.
3. Virgin females. If your class conducts genetic experiments with the fruit flies as a follow up to this investigation,
you should be aware that after mating, female flies store male sperm to fertilize their eggs. To ensure that the female
does not use sperm from a mating that occurred before the investigation begins, only virgin, or unmated, females can
be used. Since a female does not mate until 10 hours after emerging from the pupa, isolating the female soon after
emergence will ensure a virgin fly.
4. Fly mutations. Your investigation of fly behavior will probably involve wild-type flies. However, you may want
to investigate behavior of flies with genetic mutations. Common mutations include eye color variations, wing
