 are exothermic they act to 
transfer heat absorbed by the surface into the atmosphere.
Give It Some Thought
Consider the phase diagram for water shown in Figure 11.28 (page 457). In what 
pressure range and in what temperature range must H2O exist in order for H2O1s2  
to sublime to H2O1g2?

Salt Water: Earth’s Oceans and Seas
The vast layer of salty water that covers so much of the planet is in actuality one large 
connected body and is generally constant in composition. For this reason, oceanogra-
phers speak of a world ocean rather than of the s
