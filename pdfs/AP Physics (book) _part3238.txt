 their electrons
are moving about: at any instant there may be a transient separation of charge,
creating a brief dipole moment and weak attraction. All these weak bonds are
referred to as van der Waals bonds, and the forces involved van der Waals forces.
The potential energy has the general shape shown in Fig. 29–8, with the attractive
van der Waals potential energy varying as 
The force decreases greatly with
increased distance.
When one of the atoms in a dipole–dipole bond is hydrogen, as in Fig. 29–11,
it is called a hydrogen bond. A hydrogen bond is generally the strongest of the
weak bonds, because the hydrogen atom is the smallest atom and can be approached
more closely. Hydrogen bonds also have a partial “covalent” character: that is,
electrons between the two dipoles may be shared to a small extent, making a
stronger, more lasting bond.
Weak bonds are very important for understanding the activities of cells,
such as the double helix shape of DNA (Fig. 29–12), and DNA replicati
