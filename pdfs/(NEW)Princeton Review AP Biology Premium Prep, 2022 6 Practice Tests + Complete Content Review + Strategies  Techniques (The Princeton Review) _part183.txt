It is believed that chloroplasts and mitochondria used to be independent
prokaryotic cells. They have since become a permanent part of eukaryotic
cells.
Eukaryotic cells are more complex than prokaryotic cells. Fungi, protists, plants, and animals are eukaryotes.
Eukaryotic cells are organized into many smaller structures called organelles. Some of these organelles are the same
structures seen in prokaryotic cells, but many are uniquely eukaryotic. A good way to remember the difference is
that prokaryotes do not have any membrane-bound organelles. Their only membrane is the plasma membrane.
Organelles
A eukaryotic cell is like a microscopic factory. It’s filled with organelles, each of which has its own special tasks.
Let’s take a tour of a eukaryotic cell and focus on the structure and function of each organelle. Here’s a picture of a
typical animal cell and its principal organelles.
Plasma Membrane
The cell has an outer envelope known as the plasma membrane. Although the plasma me
