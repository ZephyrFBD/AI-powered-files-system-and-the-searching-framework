ncorrect because they describe negative
feedback, not positive feedback. Choice B is incorrect because both
positive feedback mechanisms and negative feedback mechanisms
are universal.
(D) Diversity results from having the richest environment with the
most varied niches. Choice A is incorrect for two reasons. First, food
chains never consist of more than 4 or 5 trophic levels anywhere on
Earth. Second, the existence of a large animal population does not
mean that the population is diverse. On the contrary, it could mean
that one invasive species has outcompeted all other organisms and
taken over the area. Choice B is incorrect because high temperatures
do not necessarily cause greater rates of speciation in a region. What
does enhance diversity, however, is having many different niches in
which animals can live. Choice C is a nonsense statement. The
tropics are spread across the equator worldwide and did not spread
from one location inside Pangaea.
