 a straight highway, which we choose to be the positive x axis (Fig. 2–11).
Then the driver steps on the brakes. If the initial velocity (when the driver hits 
the brakes) is
and it takes 5.0 s to slow down to
what was the car’s average acceleration?
APPROACH We put the given initial and final velocities, and the elapsed
time, into Eq. 2–4 for 
SOLUTION In Eq. 2–4, we call the initial time
and set
The negative sign appears because the final velocity is less than the initial velocity.
In this case the direction of the acceleration is to the left (in the negative x direc-
tion)—even though the velocity is always pointing to the right. We say that the
acceleration is 
to the left, and it is shown in Fig. 2–11 as an orange arrow.

Deceleration
When an object is slowing down, we can say it is decelerating. But be careful:
deceleration does not mean that the acceleration is neces
