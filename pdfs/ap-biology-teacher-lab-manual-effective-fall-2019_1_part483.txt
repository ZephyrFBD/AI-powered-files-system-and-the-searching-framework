re mutated. There are many 
questions you should consider before beginning your investigation. 
■ Review from Part 1 
•  How is the cell cycle controlled in normal cells? 
•  What are cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases? What do these proteins do in a cell? 
■ Prelab Questions for Part 3 
•  How are normal cells and cancer cells different from each other? 
•  What are the main causes of cancer? 
•  What goes wrong during the cell cycle in cancer cells? 
•  What makes some genes responsible for an increased risk of certain cancers? 
•  Do you think that the chromosomes might be different between normal and cancer 
cells? 
The last question is the focus of this part of the lab. With your group, form a hypothesis 
as to how the chromosomes of a cancer cell might appear in comparison to a normal cell 
and how those differences are related to the behavior of the cancer cell. 
For each of the following cases, look at pictures of the chromosomes (karyotype) 
from normal human cells. Compare
