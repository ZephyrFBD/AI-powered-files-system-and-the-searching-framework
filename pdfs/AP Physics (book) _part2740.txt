24–5 Single-Slit Diffraction
21. (I) If 680-nm light falls on a slit 0.0425 mm wide, what is
the angular width of the central diffraction peak?
22. (I) Monochromatic light falls on a slit that is 
wide. If the angle between the first dark fringes on either
side of the central maximum is 28.0° (dark fringe to dark
fringe), what is the wavelength of the light used?
23. (II) When blue light of wavelength 440 nm falls on a 
single slit, the first dark bands on either side of center are
separated by 51.0°. Determine the width of the slit.
24. (II) A single slit 1.0 mm wide is illuminated by 450-nm light.
What is the width of the central maximum (in cm) in the
diffraction pattern on a screen 6.0 m away?
25. (II) How wide is the central diffraction peak on a screen 2.30 m
behind a 0.0348-mm-wide slit illuminated by 558-nm light?
26. (II) Consider microwaves which are incident perpendicular
to a metal plate which has a 1.6-cm sli
