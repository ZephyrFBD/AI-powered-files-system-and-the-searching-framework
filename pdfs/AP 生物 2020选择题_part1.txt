This exam may not be posted on school or personal websites, nor 
electronically redistributed for any reason. This exam is provided by  
College Board for AP Exam preparation. Teachers are permitted to download 
the materials and make copies to use with their students in a classroom 
setting only. To maintain the security of this exam, teachers should collect all 
materials after their administration and keep them in a secure location.  
Further distribution of these materials outside of the secure College 
Board site disadvantages teachers who rely on uncirculated questions  
for classroom testing. Any additional distribution is in violation of College 
Board’s copyright policies and may result in the termination of Practice Exam 
access for your school as well as the removal of access to other online 
services such as the AP Teacher Community and Online Score Reports.
