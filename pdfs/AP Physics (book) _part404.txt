to one end of the cord will have the same magnitude at the other end. We wish 
to find the acceleration, a, of the system, which will have the same magnitude
for both boxes assuming the cord doesn’t stretch. As box B moves down, box A
moves to the right.
APPROACH The free-body diagrams for each box are shown in Figs. 4–32b and c.
The forces on box A are the pulling force of the cord 
gravity 
the nor-
mal force exerted by the table 
and a friction force exerted by the table 
the forces on box B are gravity 
and the cord pulling up,
SOLUTION Box A does not move vertically, so Newton’s second law tells us
the normal force just balances the weight,
In the horizontal direction, there are two forces on box A (Fig. 4–32b):
the
tension in the cord (whose value we don’t know), and the force of friction
The horizontal acceleration (box A) is what we wish to find; we use Newton’s
second law in the x direction,
which becomes (taking the positive
direction to the right and setting
):
[box A]
