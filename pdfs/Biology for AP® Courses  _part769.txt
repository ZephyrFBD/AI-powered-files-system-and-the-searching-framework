2.
For each process, does entropy increase or
decrease? Explain your reasoning in terms of
changes in the amount of order within the
system.
3.
For each process, is there an input of energy?
Explain your reasoning in terms of (a) the
source of the energy input into the system and
(b) the interaction between the system and its
environment that provides that input of energy.
61. Energy transfers occur constantly in daily activities.
Think of two scenarios: cooking on a stove and driving a
car. For each scenario, describe the system and explain
how the second law of thermodynamics applies to the
system in terms of energy input and change in entropy.
62. Consider a simple process that illustrates the change in
entropy when energy is transferred.

Take a block of ice as a system with a
temperature of 0Â°C. This is water as a solid, so it
has a high structural order. This
