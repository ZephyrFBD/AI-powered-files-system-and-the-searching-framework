At the end of meiosis II, four different gametic
combinations are produced, each containing a
haploid set of chromosomes.
c.
The chromosomes randomly align during
prophase I at the equator, and separation of sister
chromatids occurs during metaphase I of meiosis
I. Similarly separation of bivalent chromosomes
occur at metaphase II of meiosis II. At the end of
meiosis II, four different gametic combinations
are produced, each containing a diploid set of
chromosomes.
d.
The chromosomes randomly align during
prophase I at the equator, and separation of
bivalent chromosomes occur during anaphase I
of meiosis I. Similarly, separation of
homologous chromosomes occurs at metaphase
II of meiosis II. At the end of meiosis II, four
different gametic combinations are produced,
each containing a diploid set of chromosomes.
