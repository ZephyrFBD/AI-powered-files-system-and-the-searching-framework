Sample Exercise 23.3 
Naming Coordination Compounds
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the chemical formulas for two coordination 
compounds and assigned the task of naming them.
Plan To name the complexes, we need to determine the ligands in 
the complexes, the names of the ligands, and the oxidation state 
of the metal ion. We then put the information together following 
the rules listed in the text.
Solve
(a) The ligands are four water molecules—tetraaqua—and two 
chloride ions—dichloro. By assigning all the oxidation 
numbers we know for this molecule, w
