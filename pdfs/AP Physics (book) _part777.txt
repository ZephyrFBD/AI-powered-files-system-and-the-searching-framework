moving with
speed  
strikes ball B, initially at rest, of
mass  
As a result of the collision, ball A 
is deflected off at an angle of 30.0Â° with a speed
(a) Taking the x axis to be the original
direction of motion of ball A, write down the equations
expressing the conservation of momentum for the compo-
nents in the x and y directions separately. (b) Solve these
equations for the speed,
and angle,
of ball B after
the collision. Do not assume the collision is elastic.
*45. (II) A radioactive nucleus at rest decays into a second
nucleus, an electron, and a neutrino. The electron and 
neutrino are emitted at right angles and have momenta of
and
respectively.
Determine the magnitude and the direction of the momen-
tum of the second (recoiling) nucleus.
*46. (III) Billiard balls A and B, of equal mass, move at right
angles and meet at t
