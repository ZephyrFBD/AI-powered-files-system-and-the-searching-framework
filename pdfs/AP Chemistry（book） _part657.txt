 4.67 (a) How many grams of ethanol, CH3CH2OH, should you dis-
solve in water to make 1.00 L of vodka (which is an aqueous 
solution that is 6.86 M ethanol)? (b) Using the density of eth-
anol (0.789 g/mL), calculate the volume of ethanol you need 
to make 1.00 L of vodka.
 4.68 One cup of fresh orange juice contains 124 mg of ascorbic 
acid (vitamin C, C6H8O6). Given that one cup = 236.6 mL, 
calculate the molarity of vitamin C in orange juice.

sium ion: 0.20 M KCl, 0.15 M K2CrO4, or 0.080 M K3PO4?  
(b) Which will contain the greater number of moles of potassium 
ion: 30.0 mL of 0.15 M K2CrO4 or 25.0 mL of 0.080 M K3PO4?
 4.70 In each of the following pairs, indicate which has the higher
