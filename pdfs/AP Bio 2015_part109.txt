 In an experiment investigating the mechanism of protein secretion, researchers tracked the movement of 
radioactively labeled polypeptides in pancreatic cells. At various times after the labeling, samples of the cells 
were observed using an electron microscope to determine the location of the radioactively labeled polypeptides. 
Figure 1 summarizes the results at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and 30 minutes. The dark dots in the figure represent 
the radioactively labeled polypeptides.

(a) Using the experimental results, describe the pathway that secretory proteins take from their synthesis  
to their release from
