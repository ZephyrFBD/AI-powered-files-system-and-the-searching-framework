a rough estimate. We can do a rough estimate of the moment of inertia by
assuming the pulley is a uniform cylinder and using Fig. 8–20c:
This is the same order of magnitude as our result, but numerically somewhat
less. This makes sense, though, because a pulley is not usually a uniform
cylinder but instead has more of its mass concentrated toward the outside
edge. Such a pulley would be expected to have a greater moment of inertia
than a solid cylinder of equal mass. A thin hoop, Fig. 8–20a, ought to have a
greater I than our pulley, and indeed it does: I = MR2 = 0.436 kgm2.
