Another, perhaps more general, way to set up the energy conservation equa-
tion for heat transfer within an isolated system is to write that the sum of all
internal heat transfers within the system adds up to zero:
[isolated system] (14;3)
Each Q represents the heat entering or leaving one part of the system. Each term
