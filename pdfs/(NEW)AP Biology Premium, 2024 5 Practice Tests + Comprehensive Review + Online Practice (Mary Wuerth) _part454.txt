 spots per male guppy in this new predator-free
environment after the guppies were allowed to reproduce for 20 generations. Justify your prediction.
Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (A) Directional selection occurs when one end, or extreme, of the range of phenotypes has a survival advantage.
In this example, birds with larger beaks were more likely to survive. Disruptive selection occurs when both
extremes of the range of phenotypes increase in frequency; since only large beaks increased in frequency and
small beaks decreased in frequency, choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (C) is incorrect because stabilizing selection
favors the middle range of the phenotype, which did not occur in this case. There is no evidence in the question
that suggests that mate preference is dependent on beak size, so choice (D) is incorrect.
2. (B) Before the drought, there were more thin-walled seeds and therefore more food available for finches with
smaller beaks. Therefore, the end of the drought woul
