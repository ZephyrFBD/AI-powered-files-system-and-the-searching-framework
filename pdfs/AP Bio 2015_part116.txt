ation for the claim that antibiotic resistance may arise in 
bacterial species.   
Justification (1 point) 
Resistance to antibiotic(s) in the population is increasing for most of the antibiotics as
shown by the overall change in percent resistance to antibiotics from 1994 to 2000. 
•
(c) Describe THREE different processes by which antibiotic resistance develops in individual 
bacterial cells. 
Description (3 points maximum) 
Random mutations lead to changes in DNA sequences
Transformation is uptake of DNA from the environment to the bacteria
Conjugation transfers DNA from one bacterium to another during mating
Transduction introduces DNA to bacteria via viruses
Horizontal gene transfer introduces new genes to the bacteria (*only if student has not
earned a point for transformation, conjugation, or transduction)
