cumulate in the tissue causing the
leaf to snap shut.
(A)
The stimulus must reach a threshold of pressure before the
leaf can respond by shutting.
(B)
The leaf shuts when a rapid stimulus in several locations
mimics the presence of an animal.
(C)
The plant becomes sensitized to her presence and responds
to her irritating behavior.
(D)
2. A vineyard represents a complex ecosystem containing not just
the plants, but also many micro-organisms associated with the
plants and soil. These microorganisms can be both beneficial and
detrimental to the vines. For example, beneficial mycorrhizae in
the soil are symbiotic fungi that grow in or on plant roots.
Conversely, molds in the air will settle on fruit and rot the grapes.
Viticulturists can treat vineyards with fungicides to destroy the
spores of damaging mold. However, the yield from plots treated
with fungicides is usually low, and viticulturists must heavily
fertilize to increase the harvest.
