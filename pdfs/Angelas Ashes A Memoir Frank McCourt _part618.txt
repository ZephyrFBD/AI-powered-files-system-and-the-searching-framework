treets with Grandma trying to keep up. 
 
 Mam sees her bed buried under plaster and slates and pulls at her 
 
 hair,What’ll we do at all, at all? and screams at me for interfering with 
 
 the beams. Grandma says, I’ll go to the landlord’s office and tell them 
 
 fix this before ye are all drowned entirely. 
 
 She’s back in no time with the rent man. He says, Great God in 
 
 heaven, where’s the other room? 
 
 Grandma says,What room? 
 
 I rented ye two rooms up here and one is gone.Where is that room? 
 
 Mam says,What room? 
 
 There were two rooms up here and now there’s one.And what happened 
 
 to the wall? There was a wall. Now there’s no wall. I distinctly 
 
 remember a wall because I distinctly remember a room. Now where is 
 
 that wall? Where is that room? 
 
 Grandma says, I don’t remember a wall and if I don’t remember a 
 
 wall how can I remember a room? 
 
 Ye don’t remember? Well, I remember.Forty years a landlord’s agent 
 
 and I never seen the likes of this. By
