80. Cyanobacteria are single-celled organisms with the
capacity to fix nitrogen, N2. Some cyanobacteria
cooperatively aggregate as filaments, and heterocysts may
form at intervals along the filament between a pair of
vegetative (actively growing) cells. Heterocysts are
specialized cells that express certain genes when nitrogen
becomes limiting. The nitrogenase complex converts the
nitrogen in N2 into NH3 (ammonia). This enzyme
functions only under anaerobic conditions that are, in part,
enforced by an O2 barrier surrounding the cytoplasm of the
heterocyst, as shown below.

A. Other modifications displayed in the diagram maintain
an anaerobic state and synthesize ammonia from N2.
Identify four modifications of vegetative cells, either by
their addition to or omission from the heterocyst. Refine
the representation by drawing a line between each of the
three numbered circles and the feature.
B. Further refine the representation by providing a b
