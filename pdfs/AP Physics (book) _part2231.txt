llel to the field and
in Eq. 20–1.
But the magnetic field does exert a force on each of the vertical sections of wire
as shown,
and 
(see also top view, Fig. 20–34b). By right-hand-rule-2
(Fig. 20–11c or Table 20–1) the direction of the force on the upward current on
the left is in the opposite direction from the equal magnitude force 
on the
downward current on the right. These forces give rise to a net torque that acts to
rotate the coil about its vertical axis.
Let us calculate the magnitude of this torque. From Eq. 20–2
the force
where a is the length of the vertical arm of the coil (Fig.20–34a).
The lever arm for each force is 
where b is the width of the coil and the “axis”
is at the midpoint. The torques around this axis produced by 
and 
act in the
same direction (Fig. 20–34b), so the total torque is the sum of the two torques:
where
is the area of the coil. If the coil consists of N loops of wire, the
current is then NI, so the torque becomes
If the coil makes an angle with th
