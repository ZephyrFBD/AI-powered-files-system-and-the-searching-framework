us, increasing the temperature causes the equilibrium to shift 
to the right, in the direction of making more products, and K increases. In an exothermic 
reaction, the opposite occurs: Heat is produced as reactants are converted to products. 
Thus, increasing the temperature in this case causes the equilibrium to shift to the left, in 
the direction of making more reactants, and K decreases.
 
Endothermic:  
Increasing T results in higher K value
 
Exothermic:  
Increasing T results in lower K value
Cooling a reaction has the opposite effect. As we lower the temperature, the equilib-
rium shifts in the direction that produces heat. Thus, cooling an endothermic reaction 
shifts the equilibrium to the left, decreasing K, as shown in Figure 15.14, and cooling an 
exothermic reaction shifts the equilibrium to the right, increasing K.
Consider the equilibrium

In which direction will the equilibrium shift when (a) N2O4 is added, (b) NO2 is removed, (c) the
