†The brilliant young physicist Ettore Majorana (1906–1938) disappeared from a ship under
mysterious circumstances in 1938 at the age of 31.
Theoretical models of supernova explosions suggest that the neutrinos are
emitted in a burst that lasts from a second or two up to perhaps 10 s. If we assume
the neutrinos are not emitted simultaneously but rather at any time over a 10-s
interval, then that 10-s difference in arrival times could be due to a 10-s differ-
ence in their emission time. In this case the data would be consistent with zero
neutrino mass, and it put an approximate upper limit of
The actual detection of these neutrinos was brilliant—it was a rare event that
allowed us to detect something other than EM radiation from beyond the solar
system, and was an exceptional confirmation of theory. In the experiments, the
most sensitive detector consisted of several thousand tons of water in an under-
ground chamber. It detected 11 events in 12 seconds, probably via the reaction
