 of sunlight but can also
introduce heat stress. Some plants adapted to hot environments remediate this problem by orienting leaves vertically
to minimize surface area exposure to the sun. In these leaves, you may find stomata abundant on both sides of the
leaf.
7. Leaf hairs. By removing moisture from the leaf, air movement increases the moisture gradient across leaf cells
and transpiration increases. Hairs on the surface of leaves slow air movement, thus reducing transpiration.
8. Stomatal structure. Some plant species have leaves with stomata located below the leaf surface in depressions.
This reduces air movement across the stomatal opening and slows transpiration.
9. Leaf color. White or light-colored leaves reflect sunlight and can reduce leaf heating.
10. Cuticle thickness. The cuticle is a waxy coating on the surface of leaves that reduces water loss. A thick cuticle
in many plants is an adaptation to hot or dry habitats. You will need to examine a cross section of the leaf to
