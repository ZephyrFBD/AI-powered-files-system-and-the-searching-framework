ing two diagrams show the trp operon when tryptophan is absent (C) and when tryptophan is present (D).
Post-transcriptional regulation occurs when the cell creates an RNA, but then decides that it should not be
translated into a protein. This is where RNAi comes into play. RNAi molecules can bind to an RNA via
complementary base pairing. This creates a double-stranded RNA (remember RNA is usually single stranded).
When a double-stranded RNA is formed, this signals to some special destruction machinery that the RNA should be
destroyed. This would prevent it from going on to be translated.
Post-translational regulation can also occur if a cell has already made a protein, but doesnâ€™t yet need to use it. This
is an especially common regulation for enzymes because when the cell needs them, it needs them ASAP. It is easier
to make them ahead of time and then just turn them on or off as needed. This can involve binding with other
proteins, phosphorylation, pH changes, cleavage, etc. Remember,
