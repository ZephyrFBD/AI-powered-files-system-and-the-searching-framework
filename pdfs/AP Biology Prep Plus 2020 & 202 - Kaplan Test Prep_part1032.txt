and morphological incidence as well as by fossil evidence. (C) is unlikely to be
supported by either team of scientists, who would recognize that phylogenetic trees can
always be altered in light of new evidence.
12. C
The question stem mentions Cnidaria, and the figure implies that these organisms
exhibit radial symmetry (they are “Radiata” as opposed to “Bilateria”). Because
“responding to the environment equally from all directions” implies radial symmetry, (C)
is correct.
13. A
The tree grows taller, but the height of the foreign object remains constant. This implies
that the tree does not grow taller by adding building blocks at the base, but rather by
extending the ends. This matches (A). (B) is not a valid conclusion based on the stated
observations because both types of growth are observed. (C) is not supported by the
observations because the tree continues to grow taller. If the tree grew via the
mechanism described in (D), then the foreign object would be expected to rise ove
