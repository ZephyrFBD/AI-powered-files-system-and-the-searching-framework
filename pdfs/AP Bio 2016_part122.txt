lants/plant parts between the treatment groups 
Description (1 point) 
Insects must be eating/hurting the developing seeds  
(d) In a second experiment, researchers used a different insecticide that affects a different group of 
insects. In this treatment, the number of seeds formed was greatly reduced compared to the control. 
Based on this observation, describe the most likely interaction between the affected insects and the 
plants in this experiment. Justify your response. (2 points) 
Description (1 point) 
• 
Justification (1 point) 
Insects must be pollinating flowers 
When pollination is prevented, seeds do not 
develop 
Specific example of a positive/beneficial impact 
to the plants during seed formation (e.g., remove 
parasite/herbivore) 
Supports how cooperative interaction between 
insect and plant promotes seed formation
