ually 15 to 19 carbon atoms in length. Glycerol and fatty acids undergo 
condensation reactions to form ester linkages as shown in Figure 24.23. Three fatty 
acid molecules join to a glycerol. Although the three fatty acids in a fat can be the 
same, as they are in Figure 24.23, it is also possible that a fat contains three different 
fatty acids.
Lipids with saturated fatty acids are called saturated fats and are commonly solids 
at room temperature (such as butter and shortening). Unsaturated fats contain one or 
more double bonds in their carbon–carbon chains. The cis and trans nomenclature we 
learned for alkenes applies: Trans fats have H atoms on the opposite sides of the C “C 
double bond, and cis fats have H atoms on the same sides of the C “C double bond. 
Unsaturated fats (such as olive oil and peanut oil) are usually liquid at room temperature
