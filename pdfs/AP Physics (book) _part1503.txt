When it is cold, warm clothes act as
insulators to reduce heat loss from
the body to the environment by
conduction and convection. Heat
radiation from a campfire can warm
you and your clothes. The fire can
also transfer energy directly by heat
convection and conduction to what
you are cooking. Heat, like work,
represents a transfer of energy. Heat
is defined as a transfer of energy due
to a difference of temperature.
Internal energy U is the sum total of
