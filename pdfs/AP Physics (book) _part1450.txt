e of the water has changed to
the vapor or gas phase.
This process of evaporation can be explained on the basis of kinetic theory.
The molecules in a liquid move past one another with a variety of speeds that
follow, approximately, the Maxwell distribution. There are strong attractive
forces between these molecules, which is what keeps them close together in the
liquid phase. A molecule near the surface of the liquid may, because of its speed,
leave the liquid momentarily. But just as a rock thrown into the air returns to the
Earth, so the attractive forces of the other molecules can pull the vagabond mole-
cule back to the liquid surfaceâ€”that is, if its velocity is not too large. A molecule
with a high enough velocity, however, will escape the liquid entirely, like a rocket
escaping the Earth, and become part of the gas phase. Only those molecules that
have kinetic energy above a particular value can escape to the gas phase. We have
already seen that kinetic theory predicts that the r
