 is exposed to
charged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes. Adhesion is observed when
water “climbs” up the tube placed in a glass of water: notice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the tube than
in the middle. This is because the water molecules are attracted to the charged glass walls of the capillary more than they are
to each other and therefore adhere to it. This type of adhesion is called capillary action, and is illustrated in Figure 2.18.
Figure 2.18 Capillary action in a glass tube is caused by the adhesive forces exerted by the internal surface of
the glass exceeding the cohesive forces between the water molecules themselves. (credit: modification of work by

Why are cohesive and adhesive forces important for life? Cohesive and adhesive forces are important for the transport of
water from the roots to the leaves in plants. These forces create a “pu
