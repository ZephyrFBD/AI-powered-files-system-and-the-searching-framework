 equally between the fluorine atoms and, thus, the 
covalent bond is nonpolar. A nonpolar covalent bond results when the electronegativities 
of the bonded atoms are equal.
In HF the fluorine atom has a greater electronegativity than the hydrogen atom, 
with the result that the electrons are shared unequally—the bond is polar. In general, a 
polar covalent bond results when the atoms differ in electronegativity. In HF the more 
electronegative fluorine atom attracts electron density away from the less electronega-
tive hydrogen atom, leaving a partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom and a partial 
negative charge on the fluorine atom. We can represent this charge distribution as
d+  d-
H¬F
The d+ and d- (read “delta plus” and “delta minus”) symbolize the partial positive and 
negative charges, respectively. In a polar bond, these numbers are less than the full 
charges of the ions.
In LiF the electronegativity difference is very large, meaning that the electron den-
sity is shifte
