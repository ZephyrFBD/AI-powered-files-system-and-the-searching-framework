5. The circuit shown in Fig. 19–95 is a primitive 4-bit digital-
to-analog converter (DAC). In this circuit, to represent
each digit 
of a binary number, a “1” has the nth switch
closed whereas zero (“0”) has the switch open. For
example, 0010 is represented by closing switch 
while all other switches are open. Show that the voltage V
across the 
resistor for the
binary numbers 0001, 0010,
0100, and 1001 (which in
decimal represent 1, 2, 4, 9)
follows the pattern that
you expect for a 4-bit DAC.

3. Cardiac defibrillators are discussed in Section 17–9.
(a) Choose a value for the resistance so that the 
capaci-
tor can be charged to 3000 V in 2.0 seconds. Assume that
this 3000 V is 95% of the full source voltage. (b) The effective
resistance of the human body is given in Section 19–7.
