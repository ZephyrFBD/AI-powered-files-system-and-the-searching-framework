9. (II) Suppose that you have a 9.0-V battery and wish to apply
a voltage of only 3.5 V. Given an unlimited supply of 
resistors, how could you connect them to make a “voltage
divider” that produces a 3.5-V output for a 9.0-V input?
10. (II) Three 
resistors can be connected together in
four different ways, making combinations of series and/or
parallel circuits. What are these four ways, and what is the
net resistance in each case?
11. (II) A battery with an emf of 12.0 V shows a terminal voltage
of 11.8 V when operating in a circuit with two lightbulbs,
each rated at 4.0 W (at 12.0 V), which are connected in
parallel. What is the battery’s internal resistance?
12. (II) Eight identical bulbs are connected in series across a
120-V line. (a) What is the voltage across each bulb? (b) If
the current is 0.45 A, what is the resistance of each bulb,
and what is the power dissipated in each?
