 in water for sur-
vival. (a) What is this concentration in mol>L? (b) What 
partial pressure of O2 above water is needed to obtain 
 
4 ppm O2 in water at 10 °C? (The Henry’s law constant for 
O2 at this temperature is 1.71 * 10-3 mol>L@atm.)
 13.94  The presence of the radioactive gas radon (Rn) in well wa-
ter presents a possible health hazard in parts of the United 
States. (a) Assuming that the solubility of radon in water 
with 1 atm pressure of the gas over the water at 30 °C is 
7.27 * 10-3 M, what is the Henry’s law constant for radon 
in water at this temperature? (b) A sample consisting of 
various gases contains 3.5 * 10-6 mole fraction of radon. 
This gas at a total pressure of 32 atm is shaken with water 
at 30 °C. Calculate the molar concentration of radon in the 
water.
 13.95  Glucose makes up about 0.10% by mass of human blood. 
Calculate this concentration in (a) ppm, (b) molality. 
 
(c) What further information would you need to determine 
the molarity of the solut
