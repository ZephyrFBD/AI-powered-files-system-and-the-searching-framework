f energy and mass are 
accounted for is often a challenge for students. 
Students (and the general public) typically lack an intuitive understanding of 
exponential processes, such as compounded interest, population growth, or radioactive 
decay. Exponential processes abound in biology. Measurement of these processes often 
involves log scales. We use a logarithmic scale for pH measurements, where a simple 
0.3-unit change represents a five-fold change in the concentration of hydrogen ions, or 
a 2-unit change represents a one-hundred-fold change in the concentration of hydrogen 
ions. Without an explicit connection to the logarithmic scale of pH measurement, 
the student often develops an understanding of pH scale that is deficient and overly 
simplistic â€” a mental model that will not hold up if the student is asked to compare the 
acidity of various soils or rain water, for example. 
Serial dilutions are another example of a lack of student understanding; somehow it 
seems counterint
