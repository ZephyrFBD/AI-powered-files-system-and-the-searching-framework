ently, we can define the change in gravitational potential energy,
in terms of the work done by gravity itself. Starting from Eq. 6–5b, we obtain
or
(6;7b)
That is, the change in gravitational potential energy as the object moves from
position 1 to position 2 is equal to the negative of the work done by gravity itself.
Gravitational potential energy depends on the vertical height of the object
above some reference level (Eq. 6–6). In some situations, you may wonder from
what point to measure the height y. The gravitational potential energy of a book
held high above a table, for example, depends on whether we measure y from
the top of the table, from the floor, or from some other reference point. What 
is physically important in any situation is the change in potential energy,
because that is what is related to the work done, Eqs. 6–7; and it is 
that 
can be measured. We can thus choose to measure y from any reference level 
that is convenient, but we must choose the reference level at
