Determine (a) the energy and (b) the
orbital angular momentum for an electron in each of the hydrogen atom states
with 
, as in Example 28–4.
APPROACH The energy of a state depends only on n, except for the very small
corrections mentioned above, which we will ignore. Energy is calculated as in the
Bohr model,
For angular momentum we use Eq. 28–3.
SOLUTION (a) Since 
for all these states, they all have the same energy,
(b) For
Eq. 28–3 gives
For

NOTE Atomic angular momenta are generally given as a multiple of 
(
or
in this case), rather than in SI units.
EXERCISE D What are the energy and angular momentum of the electron in a hydrogen
atom with
Although and 
do not significantly affect the energy levels in hydrogen,
they do affect the electron probability distribution in space. For
