arbon-to-carbon bonds affect the geometry of the molecule. The names of all three molecules start with the prefix “eth-,”
which is the prefix for two carbon hydrocarbons. The suffixes “-ane,” “-ene,” and “-yne” refer to the presence of single,
double, or triple carbon-carbon bonds, respectively. Thus, propane, propene, and propyne follow the same pattern with three
carbon molecules, butane, butene, and butyne for four carbon molecules, and so on. Double and triple bonds change the
geometry of the molecule: single bonds allow rotation along the axis of the bond, whereas double bonds lead to a planar
configuration and triple bonds to a linear one. These geometries have a significant impact on the shape a particular molecule
can assume.
Figure 2.24 When carbon forms single bonds with other atoms, the shape is tetrahedral. When two carbon atoms form
a double bond, the shape is planar, or flat. Single bonds, like those found in ethane, are able to rotate. Double bonds,
like those found in e
