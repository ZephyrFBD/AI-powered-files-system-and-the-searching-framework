ste or
powder. (2) An excretory mechanism occurs in
the flatworm, which contains two tubules with
cells called flame cells. They have cilia that
propel waste matter down the tubules and out of
the body.
b.
(1) An excretory mechanism occurs in
arthropods through a pore called the
nephridiopore. These organisms have a system
for tubular reabsorption. (2) An excretory
mechanism occurs in annelids through the
Malpighian tubules. Metabolic wastes like uric
acid freely diffuse into the tubules. Uric acid is
excreted as a thick paste or powder.
c.
(1) An excretory mechanism is endocytosis,
which occurs when vacuoles merge with the cell
membrane and excrete cellular wastes in the
environment. (2) An excretory mechanism
