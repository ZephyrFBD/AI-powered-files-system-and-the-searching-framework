econd most abundant element in living organisms. Carbon is present in all organic molecules, and its role
in the structure of macromolecules is of primary importance to living organisms. Carbon compounds contain especially
high energy, particularly those derived from fossilized organisms, mainly plants, which humans use as fuel. Since the
1800s, the number of countries using massive amounts of fossil fuels has increased. Since the beginning of the Industrial
Revolution, global demand for the Earth’s limited fossil fuel supplies has risen; therefore, the amount of carbon dioxide
in our atmosphere has increased. This increase in carbon dioxide has been associated with climate change and other
disturbances of the Earth’s ecosystems and is a major environmental concern worldwide. Thus, the “carbon footprint” is
based on how much carbon dioxide is produced and how much fossil fuel countries consume.
The carbon cycle is most easily studied as two interconnected sub-cycles: one dealing with r
