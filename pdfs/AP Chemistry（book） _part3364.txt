observation that stable nuclei with an even number of protons and/or neutrons are 
far more numerous than those with odd numbers. The preference for even numbers of 
protons is illustrated in Figure 21.3, which shows the number of stable isotopes for all 
elements up to Xe. Notice that once we move past nitrogen, the elements with an odd 
number of protons invariably have fewer stable isotopes than their neighbors with an 
even number of pro
