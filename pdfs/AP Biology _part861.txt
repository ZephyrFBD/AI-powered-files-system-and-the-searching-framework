You have two identical cultures of E. coli bacteria: culture A and
culture B. You transform culture A, heat shocking it in the presence
of a plasmid that is resistant to ampicillin. You transform culture B,
heat shocking it in the presence of a plasmid that is resistant to
tetracycline. You then prepare four agar Petri dishes, with and
without antibiotic, as shown on the following table.
Plate I
With ampicillin only
Plate II
With tetracycline only
Plate III
With no antibiotics
Plate IV
With both antibiotics
What do you predict will be the results of plating the bacteria from
culture A and culture B on all four agar Petri dishes, if both cultures
of bacteria took up the plasmids they were exposed to?
Bacteria B will grow on plates II and III only.
Bacteria A will grow on plate I only.
Bacteria B will grow on plate III only.
Bacteria A will grow on plates I, II, and III.
