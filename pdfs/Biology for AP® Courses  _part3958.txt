ble domains in precursor cells that are destined to become
B cells. The variable domains from the heavy and light chains interact to form the binding site through which an antibody
can bind a specific epitope on an antigen. The numbers of repeated constant domains in Ig classes are the same for all
antibodies corresponding to a specific class. Antibodies are structurally similar to the extracellular component of the BCRs,
and B cell maturation to plasma cells can be visualized in simple terms as the cell acquires the ability to secrete the
extracellular portion of its BCR in large quantities.
Antibody Classes
Antibodies can be divided into five classes—IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, IgE—based on their physiochemical, structural, and
immunological properties. IgGs, which make up about 80 percent of all antibodies, have heavy chains that consist of one
variable domain and three identical constant domains. IgA and IgD also have three constant domains per heavy chain,
whereas IgM and IgE each have fo
