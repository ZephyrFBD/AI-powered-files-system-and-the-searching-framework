23–10 Lensmaker’s Equation
A useful equation, called the lensmaker’s equation, relates the focal length of a lens 
to the radii of curvature 
and 
of its two surfaces and its index of refraction n:
(23;10)
If both surfaces are convex,
and 
are considered positive.† For a concave
surface, the radius must be considered negative.
Notice that Eq. 23–10 is symmetrical in 
and 
Thus, if a lens is turned
around so that light impinges on the other surface, the focal length is the same
even if the two lens surfaces are different. This confirms what we said earlier:
a lens’ focal length is the same on both sides of the lens.
