17–8 Dielectrics
47. (I) What is the capacitance of two square parallel plates
6.6 cm on a side that are separated by 1.8 mm of paraffin?
48. (I) What is the capacitance of a pair of circular plates with
a radius of 5.0 cm separated by 2.8 mm of mica?
49. (II) An uncharged capacitor is connected to a 21.0-V battery
until it is fully charged, after which it is disconnected from
the battery. A slab of paraffin is then inserted between the
plates. What will now be the voltage between the plates?
50. (II) A 3500-pF air-gap capacitor is connected to a 32-V
battery. If a piece of mica is placed between the plates,
how much charge will flow from the battery?
51. (II) The electric field between the plates of a paper-separated
capacitor is 
The plates are
1.95 mm apart, and the charge on each is
