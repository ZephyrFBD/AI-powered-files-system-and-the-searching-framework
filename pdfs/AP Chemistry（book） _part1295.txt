represented either by two structures separated by a double-headed 
arrow or by a shorthand notation in which we draw a hexagon with a circle inside:
or
The shorthand notation reminds us that benzene is a blend of two resonance struc-
tures—it emphasizes that the C “C double bonds cannot be assigned to specific edges of 
the hexagon. Chemists use both representations of benzene interchangeably.
The bonding arrangement in benzene confers special stability to the molecule. As a 
result, millions of organic compounds contain the six-membered ring characteristic of 
 
 
 
 
▲ Figure 8.15 Benzene, an “aromatic” 
organic compound. The benzene molecule 
is a regular hexagon of carbon atoms with 
a hydrogen atom bonded to each one. The 
dashed lines represent the blending of two 
equivalent resonance structures, leading 
to C¬ C bonds that are intermediate 
between single and double bonds.
What is the significance of the 
dashed bonds in this ball-and-stick 
model?
