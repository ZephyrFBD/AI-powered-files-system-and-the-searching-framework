the next generation. Over many years, long-beak finches became more and more plentiful with each
generation until long beaks were the “norm.” In another example, on the first island Darwin studied, there must once
have been short-necked tortoises. Unable to reach higher vegetation, these tortoises eventually died off, leaving only
those tortoises with longer necks. Consequently, evolution has come to be thought of as “the survival of the fittest”:
only those organisms most fit to survive will survive and reproduce.
Darwin elaborated his theory in a book entitled On the Origin of Species. In a nutshell, here’s what Darwin
observed:
Each species produces more offspring than can survive.
These offspring compete with one another for the limited resources available to them.
Organisms in every population vary.
The fittest offspring, or those with the most favorable traits, are the most likely to survive and therefore produce
a second generation.
