10.2 ∣ Pressure
The molecules of a gas move chaotically, colliding with each other and with the walls 
of their container. The impacts with the container walls exert a force—an outward push 
against the walls. The pressure, P, that a gas exerts is defined as the force, F, divided by 
the area, A, of the surface on which the force is acting:
 
P = F
A 
[10.1]
Gases exert a pressure on any surface with
