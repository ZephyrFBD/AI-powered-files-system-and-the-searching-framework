e statue, which
remains at rest, so the vector sum of these two forces must be zero (Newton’s second
law). Hence 
and 
must be of equal magnitude and in opposite directions.
But they are not the equal and opposite forces spoken of in Newton’s third law. The
action and reaction forces of Newton’s third law act on different objects, whereas the
two forces shown in Fig.4–14a act on the same object. For each of the forces shown
in Fig. 4–14a, we can ask, “What is the reaction force?” The upward force 
on the statue is exerted by the table. The reaction to this force is a force exerted by
the statue downward on the table. It is shown in Fig. 4–14b, where it is labeled 
This force,
exerted on the table by the statue, is the reaction force to 
in
accord with Newton’s third law. What about the other force on the statue, the force
of gravity 
exerted by the Earth? Can you guess what the reaction is to this
force? We will see in Chapter 5 that the reaction force is also a gravitational force,
