ion of 5.00 g of lauryl alcohol in 
0.100 kg of benzene freezes at 4.1 °C. What is the molar 
mass of lauryl alcohol from this data?
 13.81  Lysozyme is an enzyme that breaks bacterial cell walls. A 
solution containing 0.150 g of this enzyme in 210 mL of 
solution has an osmotic pressure of 0.953 torr at 25 °C. 
What is the molar mass of lysozyme?
 13.82  A dilute aqueous solution of an organic compound soluble 
in water is formed by dissolving 2.35 g of the compound 
in water to form 0.250 L of solution. The resulting solution 
has an osmotic pressure of 0.605 atm at 25 °C. Assuming 
that the organic compound is a nonelectrolyte, what is its 
molar mass?
 13.83  The osmotic pressure of a 0.010 M aqueous solution of 
CaCl2 is found to be 0.674 atm at 25 °C. Calculate the van’t 
Hoff factor, i, for the solution.
 
[13.84] Based on the data given in Table 13.4, which solution 
would give the larger freezing-point lowering, a 0.030 m 
solution of NaCl or a 0.020 m solution of K2SO4?
