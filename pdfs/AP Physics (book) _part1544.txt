s the air layer. If there is a heavy wind, the air outside
a window will constantly be replaced with cold air; the temperature gradient
across the glass will be greater and there will be a much greater rate of heat loss.
Increasing the width of the air layer, such as using two panes of glass separated
by an air gap, will reduce the heat loss more than simply increasing the glass
thickness, since the thermal conductivity of air is much less than that for glass.
Such “double-pane windows” are often called thermal windows.
The insulating properties of clothing come from the insulating properties of
air. Without clothes, our bodies in still air would heat the air in contact with the
skin and would soon become reasonably comfortable because air is a very good
insulator. But since air moves—there are breezes and drafts, and people move
about—the warm air would be replaced by cold air, thus increasing the tempera-
ture difference and the heat loss from the body. Clothes keep us warm by trappi
