ukaryotic cells, transcription occurs in the nucleus, separate from the translation that occurs in the
cytoplasm along ribosomes attached to endoplasmic reticulum. As stated above, gene expression in prokaryotes is regulated
at the level of transcription, whereas in eukaryotes, gene expression is regulated at multiple levels, including the epigenetic
(DNA), transcriptional, pre- and post-transcriptional, and translational levels.
The science of epigenetics studies heritable changes in the genome that do not affect the underlying DNA gene sequences.
The content presented in this section supports the learning objectives outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP速 Biology Curriculum
Framework. The AP速 learning objectives merge essential knowledge content with one or more of the seven science
practices. These objectives provide a transparent foundation for the AP速 Biology course, along with inquiry-based
laboratory experiences, instructional activities, and AP速 exam questions.
