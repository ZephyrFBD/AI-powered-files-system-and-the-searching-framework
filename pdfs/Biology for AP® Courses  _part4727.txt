 of Biodiversity
Biodiversity is not evenly distributed on Earth. Lake Victoria contained almost 500 species of cichlids alone, ignoring the
other fish families present in the lake. All of these species were found only in Lake Victoria; therefore, the 500 species
of cichlids were endemic. Endemic species are found in only one location. Endemics with highly restricted distributions
are particularly vulnerable to extinction. Higher taxonomic levels, such as genera and families, can also be endemic. Lake
Huron contains about 79 species of fish, all of which are found in many other lakes in North America. What accounts for the
difference in fish diversity in these two lakes? Lake Victoria is a tropical lake, while Lake Huron is a temperate lake. Lake
Huron in its present form is only about 7,000 years old, while Lake Victoria in its present form is about 15,000 years old.
Biogeographers have suggested these two factors, latitude and age, are two of several hypotheses to explain biodiversit
