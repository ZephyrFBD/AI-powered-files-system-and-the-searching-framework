er or transferred between 
systems and surroundings. The energy 
possessed by a system is called its internal 
energy. Internal energy is a state function, 
a quantity whose value depends only on the 
current state of a system, not on how the 
system came to be in that state.
 
5.3  ▶ Enthalpy Define a state function called 
enthalpy that is useful because the change 
in enthalpy measures the quantity of heat 
energy gained or lost by a system in a 
process occurring under constant pressure.
 
5.4  ▶ Enthalpies of Reaction  
Discover that the enthalpy change 
associated with a given chemical reaction 
is equal to the enthalpies of the products 
minus the enthalpies of the reactants. 
This quantity is directly proportional to 
the amount of reactant consumed in the 
reaction.
 
5.5  ▶ Calorimetry Examine calorimetry, an 
experimental technique used to measure 
heat changes in chemical processes.
 
5.6  ▶ Hess’s Law Learn that the enthalpy 
change for a given reaction can be 
calculated
