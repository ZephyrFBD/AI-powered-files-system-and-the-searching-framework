Living organisms need food to survive as it contains critical nutrients in the form of biological macromolecules. These
large molecules are composed mainly of six elements—sulfur, phosphorus, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen
(SPONCH)—in different quantities and arrangements. Complex polymers are built from combinations of smaller monomers
by dehydration synthesis, a chemical reaction in which a molecule of water is removed between two linking monomers.
(Think of a train: each boxcar, including the caboose, represents a monomer, and the entire train is a polymer.) During
digestion, polymers can be broken down by hydrolysis, or the addition of water. Both dehydration and hydrolysis reactions
in cells are catalyzed by specific enzymes. Dehydration reactions typically require an investment of energy for new bond
formation, whereas hydrolysis reactions typically release energy that can be used to power cellular processes. The four
categories of macromolecules are car
