 yeer dinner? Pig’s head! Jesus, Mary an’ Joseph, that’s goin’ beyond the 
 
 beyonds.Couldn’t your father get out and find a ham or a goose at least? 
 
 What kind of man is he at all, at all? 
 
 Mam puts the head in the pot, just covered with water, and while 
 
 the pig is boiling away Dad takes Malachy and me to Mass at the 
 
 Redemptorist church. It’s warm in the church and sweet with flowers 
 
 and incense and candles. He takes us to see the Baby Jesus in the crib. 
 
 He’s a big fat baby with fair curls like Malachy. Dad tells us that’s Jesus’ 
 
 mother there, Mary, in the blue dress, and his father, St. Joseph, the old 
 
 man with the beard. He says they’re sad because they know Jesus will 
 
 grow up and be killed so that we can all go to heaven. I ask why the 
 
 Baby Jesus has to die and Dad says you can’t ask questions like that. 
 
 Malachy says,Why? and Dad tells him be quiet. 
 
 Mam is in a terrible state at home.There isn’t enough coal to cook
