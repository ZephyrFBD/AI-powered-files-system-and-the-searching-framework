from the eukaryotic gene does not have the same amino acid sequence as the protein produced from the
gene in eukaryotic cells. Which of the following best explains this?
(A) Prokaryotes and eukaryotes do not use the same genetic code, so the bacteria cannot decode the eukaryotic
gene.
(B) Eukaryotic genes contain introns, which must be removed before translation; prokaryotes cannot remove
introns.
(C) Prokaryotes do not have a nucleus and cannot perform transcription.
(D) Prokaryotes do not have rough endoplasmic reticulum, so they cannot translate eukaryotic genes.
3. Which of the following correctly represents the mRNA sequence that would be transcribed from the DNA
sequence 3′ ACC GGT AAG TTC 5′?
(A) 3′ TGG CCA TTC AAG 5′
(B) 3′ UGG CCA UUC AAG 5′
(C) 5′ TGG CCA TTC AAG 3′
(D) 5′ UGG CCA UUC AAG 3′
4. What is the amino acid sequence that would be translated from the following gene? (Use Figure 16.4 to answer
this question.)
3′ AAT CGT TTC AAT CAA 5′
(A) Asn-Arg-Phe-Asn-Gln
(B) Leu-A
