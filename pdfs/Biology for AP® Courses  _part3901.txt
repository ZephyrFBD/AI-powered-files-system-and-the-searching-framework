Pathogen Recognition
An infection may be intracellular or extracellular, depending on the pathogen. All viruses infect cells and replicate within
those cells (intracellularly), whereas bacteria and other parasites may replicate intracellularly or extracellularly, depending
on the species. The innate immune system must respond accordingly: by identifying the extracellular pathogen and/
or by identifying host cells that have already been infected. When a pathogen enters the body, cells in the blood and
lymph detect the specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the pathogen’s surface. PAMPs are
carbohydrate, polypeptide, and nucleic acid “signatures” that are expressed by viruses, bacteria, and parasites but which
differ from molecules on host cells. The immune system has specific cells, described in Figure 33.2 and shown in Figure
33.3, with receptors that recognize these PAMPs. A macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles
and pathogens
