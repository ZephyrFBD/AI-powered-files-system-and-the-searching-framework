aid she was ‘ﬂoored with the EMF coming oﬀ’
the devices she checked. All this makes total sense and syncs with
my own work of decades when you think that Moderna refers in
documents to its mRNA ‘vaccine’ as an ‘operating system’:
Recognizing the broad potential of mRNA science, we set out to create an mRNA technology
platform that functions very much like an operating system on a computer. It is designed so
that it can plug and play interchangeably with different programs. In our case, the ‘program’
or ‘app’ is our mRNA drug – the unique mRNA sequence that codes for a protein …
… Our MRNA Medicines – ‘The ‘Software Of Life’: When we have a concept for a new
mRNA medicine and begin research, fundamental components are already in place.
Generally, the only thing that changes from one potential mRNA medicine to another is the
coding region – the actual genetic code that instructs ribosomes to make protein. Utilizing
these instruction sets gives our investigational mRNA medicines a softwar
