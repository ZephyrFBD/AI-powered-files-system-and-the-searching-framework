44. Why is it essential for organisms to maintain a constant
body temperature? Describe adaptations that help the
organisms cope with changes in environmental
temperature.

a.
The rate of metabolic processes increases at very
high or low temperatures. So, organisms have to
maintain a constant body temperature. This can
be achieved only by migration to avoid seasonal
temperature changes.
b.
Enzymes that carry out metabolic processes are
denatured at very high temperatures. So,
organisms have to maintain a constant body
temperature. This can be achieved by
hibernation, aestivation, or migration.
