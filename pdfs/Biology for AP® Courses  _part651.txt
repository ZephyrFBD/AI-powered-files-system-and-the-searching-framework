he sun. Plants use photosynthesis to capture sunlight, and
herbivores eat those plants to obtain energy. Carnivores eat the herbivores, and decomposers digest plant and animal
matter.

Metabolism of Carbohydrates
The metabolism of sugar (a simple carbohydrate) is a classic example of the many cellular processes that use and produce
energy. Living things consume sugar as a major energy source, because sugar molecules have a great deal of energy stored
within their bonds. The breakdown of glucose, a simple sugar, is described by the equation:
C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 â†’6CO2 + 6H2 O + energy
Carbohydrates that are consumed have their origins in photosynthesizing organisms like plants (Figure 6.3). During
photosynthesis, plants use the energy of sunlight to convert carbon dioxide gas (CO2) into sugar molecules, like glucose
(C6H12O6). Because this process involves synthesizing a larger, energy-storing molecule, it requires an input of energy to
proceed. The synthesis of glu
