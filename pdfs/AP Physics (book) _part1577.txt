9. (I) An automobile cooling system holds 18 L of water. How
much heat does it absorb if its temperature rises from 15°C
to 95°C?
10. (I) What is the specific heat of a metal substance if 135 kJ
of heat is needed to raise 4.1 kg of the metal from 18.0°C to
37.2°C?
11. (II) (a) How much energy is required to bring a 1.0-L pot of
water at 20°C to 100°C? (b) For how long could this amount
of energy run a 60-W lightbulb?
12. (II) Samples of copper, aluminum, and water experience the
same temperature rise when they absorb the same amount of
heat. What is the ratio of their masses? [Hint: See Table 14–1.]
13. (II) How long does it take a 750-W coffeepot to bring to a
boil 0.75 L of water initially at 11°C? Assume that the part
of the pot which is heated with the water is made of 280 g
of aluminum, and that no water boils away.
14. (II) What will be the equilibrium temperature when a 265-g
