81. In climbing up a rope, a 62-kg athlete climbs a vertical dis-
tance of 5.0 m in 9.0 s. What minimum power output was
used to accomplish this feat?
82. If a 1300-kg car can accelerate from 
to 
in
3.8 s, how long will it take to accelerate from 
to
Assume the power stays the same, and neglect
frictional losses.
83. A cyclist starts from rest and coasts down a 4.0° hill. The
mass of the cyclist plus bicycle is 85 kg. After the cyclist
has traveled 180 m, (a) what was the net work done by
gravity on the cyclist? (b) How fast is the cyclist going?
Ignore air resistance and friction.
84. A film of Jesse Owens’s famous long jump (Fig. 6–47) in
the 1936 Olympics shows that his center of mass rose 1.1 m
from launch point to the top of
the arc. What minimum speed
did he need at launch if he was
traveling at
