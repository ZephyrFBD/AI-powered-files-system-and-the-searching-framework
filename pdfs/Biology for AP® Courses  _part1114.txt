code for blood type: sequence A, sequence B, and
sequence O. Because all diploid human cells have two copies of the chromosome that determines blood type, the blood type

(the trait) is determined by which two versions of the marker gene are inherited. It is possible to have two copies of the
same gene sequence on both homologous chromosomes, with one on each (for example, AA, BB, or OO), or two different
sequences, such as AB.
Minor variations of traits, such as blood type, eye color, and handedness, contribute to the natural variation found within
a species. However, if the entire DNA sequence from any pair of human homologous chromosomes is compared, the
difference is less than one percent. The sex chromosomes, X and Y, are the single exception to the rule of homologous
chromosome uniformity: Other than a small amount of homology that is necessary to accurately produce gametes, the genes
found on the X and Y chromosomes are different.
