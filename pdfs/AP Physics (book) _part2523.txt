FIGURE 23–14 Rays parallel to the principal 
axis of a concave spherical mirror come to a 
focus at F, the focal point, as long as the mirror 
is small in width as compared to its radius of 
curvature, r, so that the rays are “paraxial”—
that is, make only small angles with the 
horizontal axis.
Now we will show, for a mirror whose reflecting surface is small compared to
its radius of curvature, that the rays very nearly meet at a common point, F, and
we will also determine the focal length f. In this approximation, we consider only
rays that make a small angle with the principal axis; such rays are called paraxial
rays, and their angles are exaggerated in Fig. 23–14 to make the labels clear. First
we consider a ray that strikes the mirror at B in Fig. 23–14. The point C is the
center of curvature of the mirror (the center of the sphere of which the
