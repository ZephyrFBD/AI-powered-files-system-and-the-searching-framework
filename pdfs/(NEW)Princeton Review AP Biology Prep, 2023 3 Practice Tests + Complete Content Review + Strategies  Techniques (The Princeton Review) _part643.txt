e the ratio of the offspring given in the question and work
backward. The ratio of black-haired to white-haired guinea pigs is 3:1. In order to get a white-haired offspring,
each parent must have been able to contribute a b allele. However, since the parents were both black in color,
they must have each been Bb.

The mean weight of the offspring in the next generation will be heavier than the mean weight of the original
population because all the lighter horses in the original population died off. The normal distribution for weight
will therefore shift to the heavier end (to the right of the graph). You can therefore eliminate (C) because the
mean weight should increase. The mean weight of the offspring could be heavier or lighter than their parents,
so you can also eliminate (A) and (B).

Apoptosis (programmed cell death) separates fingers and toes. Meiosis is the formation of gametes, plasmids
are circular genetic structures in bacteria, and operons are sets of multiple gen
