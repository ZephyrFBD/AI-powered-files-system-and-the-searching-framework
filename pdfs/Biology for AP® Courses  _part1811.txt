olecule that is attached to the 5' end of a messenger RNA to protect
the end from degradation
5' untranslated region; region just upstream of the protein-coding region in an RNA molecule that is not translated
protein that binds to prokaryotic operators to increase transcription
protein that complexes with cAMP to bind to the promoter sequences of operons
that control sugar processing when glucose is not available
transcription factor binding sites within the promoter that regulate the transcription of a gene
adjacent to it
enzyme that chops the pre-miRNA into the mature form of the miRNA
epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing; commonly found in cancer cells
segment of DNA that is upstream, downstream, perhaps thousands of nucleotides away, or on another
chromosome that influence the transcription of a specific gene
heritable changes that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence
protein that binds first to an mRNA to initiate translation
processes that control the turni
