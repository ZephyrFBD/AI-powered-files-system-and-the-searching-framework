Leaf Trace Method to Calculate Leaf Surface Area 
Leaf surface area may be calculated with the leaves still attached to the plant. 
Alternatively, students may cut off several leaves, arrange them on a piece of graph paper 
or grid (constructed so that a square of 4 blocks equals 1 cm2), and trace the edge pattern 
directly onto the graph paper. Count all the grids (squares) that are completely within 
the tracing and estimate the number of grids that lie partially within the tracing. The 
total surface area can then be calculated by dividing the total number of blocks covered 
by 4. Leaf surface area is recorded in
2
 cm2. Students are then asked to calculate leaf 
surface area in mm .
