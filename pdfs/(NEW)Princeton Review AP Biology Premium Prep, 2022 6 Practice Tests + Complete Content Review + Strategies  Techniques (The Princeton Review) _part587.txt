ygen appeared. Oxygen was absent at 3.25 billion years
and present at 3 billion years so photosynthesis must have begun between those times; eliminate (A) and
(C). Autotrophs, not heterotrophs, perform photosynthesis. Heterotrophs rely on eating other things for
their energy.

B
The similarity suggests that humans and chimpanzees are more closely related than humans and dogs.
Because these two organisms share similar amino acid sequences, humans must share more recent
common ancestors with chimpanzees than with dogs.

A
There is no way for these two parents to produce a type O child. The only genotype that will result in type
O blood is two “O” alleles, one from each parent, since the allele for O blood is recessive to the alleles for
A or B blood. The AB parent has alleles for only A and B blood, so it is impossible for these two
individuals to produce a child with type O blood.

The largest amount of energy is available to producers. Population B is most likely composed of
