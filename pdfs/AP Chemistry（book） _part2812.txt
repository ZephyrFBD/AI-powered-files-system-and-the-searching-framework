two different precipitating agents. Based on Figure 17.23, 
what two precipitating agents could be used? Using these 
agents, indicate which of the cations is A, which is B, and 
which is C. [Section 17.7]

17.9  The following graphs represent the behavior of BaCO3 un-
der different circumstances. In each case, the vertical axis 
indicates the solubility of the BaCO3 and the horizontal 
axis represents the concentration of some other reagent. 
(a) Which graph represents what happens to the solubility 
of BaCO3 as HNO3 is added? (b) Which graph represents 
what happens to the BaCO3 solubility as Na2CO3 is added? 
(c) Which represents what happ
