e resulting conductivity
allows a small steady electric current. If smoke enters, the radiation is absorbed
by the smoke particles rather than by the air molecules, thus reducing the current.
The current drop is detected by the device’s electronics and sets off the alarm.
The radiation dose that escapes from an intact americium smoke detector is much
less than the natural radioactive background, and so can be considered relatively
harmless. There is no question that smoke detectors save lives and reduce property
damage.
30–5 Beta Decay
Decay
Transmutation of elements also occurs when a nucleus decays by 
decay—that
is, with the emission of an electron or 
particle. The nucleus 
for example,
emits an electron when it decays:
where 
is the symbol for the electron. The particle known as the neutrino has
charge
and a very small mass, long thought to be zero. It was not initially
detected and was only later hypothesized to exist, as we shall discuss later in this
Section. No nucleons are lo
