seeds. They harvest pine cones from the trees and store them
through the winter. They are most successful at harvesting seeds
from wide, heavy pine cones. Some forests that are inhabited by red
squirrels are also inhabited by crossbill birds, which compete with
the squirrels for lodgepole pine seeds. In those areas where the two
animals have been competing for lodgepole pine seeds for thousands
of years, the crossbills have evolved a deeper and wider bill than the
common bill found in the rest of its species. This enables them to
compete for seeds more effectively against the red squirrels. In four
isolated forest ranges east and west of the Rocky Mountains, red
squirrels have been absent for 10,000 to 12,000 years, and red
crossbills are the main lodgepole pine seed predator.
Which of the following would best describe the crossbill in these
isolated mountain forest ranges?
The crossbills would have a deeper and wider bill.
The crossbills would have evolved a bill that would help them
