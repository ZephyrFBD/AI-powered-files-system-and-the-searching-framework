concentrations of ions involved in the 
equilibrium.
(4) Use the equilibrium-constant expression to calculate 3H+4 and 
then pH.
Solve 
First, because CH3COOH is a weak electrolyte and CH3COONa 
is a strong electrolyte, the major species in the solution are 
CH3COOH (a weak acid), Na+ (which  is neither acidic nor ba-
sic and is therefore a spectator in the acid–base chemistry), and 
CH3COO- (which is the conjugate base of CH3COOH).
Second, 3H+4 and, therefore, the pH are controlled by the disso-
ciation equilibrium of CH3COOH:
CH3COOH1aq2 ∆ H+1aq2 + CH3COO-1aq2
(We have written the equilibrium using H+1aq2 rather than 
H3O+1aq2, but both representations of the hydrated hydrogen 
ion are equally valid.)
Third, we tabulate the initial and equilibrium concentrations 
as we did in solving other equilibrium problems in Chapters 15 
and 16:
CH3COOH1aq2 ∆H+1aq2 + CH3COO-1aq2
