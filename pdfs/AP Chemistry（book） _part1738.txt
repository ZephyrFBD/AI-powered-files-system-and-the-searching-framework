The viscosity of a substance decreases with increasing temperature. This can be seen 
in the viscosity of octane:
7.06 * 10-4 kg>m@s at 0 °C 
4.33 * 10-4 kg>m@s at 40 °C
At higher temperatures, the greater average kinetic energy of the molecules overcomes 
the attractive forces between molecules.
Surface tension
The surface of water behaves almost as if it had an elastic skin, as evidenced by the abil-
ity of certain insects to “walk” on water. This behavior is due to an imbalance of inter-
molecular forces at the surface of the liquid. As shown in Figure 11.18, molecules in the 
interior are attracted equally in all directions, but those at the surface experience a net 
inward force. This net force tends to pull surface molecules toward the interior, thereby 
reducing the sur
