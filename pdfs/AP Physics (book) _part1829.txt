arging object is removed from an electroscope
(a) charged by induction and (b) charged by conduction?
(c) Is it possible to tell whether the electroscope in Fig.16–12a
has been charged by induction or by conduction? If so, which
way was it charged? (d) Draw electric field lines (Section 16–8)
for the electroscopes in Figs. 16–11a and 16–11b, omitting
the fields around the charging rod. How do the fields differ?
2. Four equal positive point charges, each of charge 
are at the corners of a square of side 9.2 cm. What charge
should be placed at the center of the square so that all
charges are at equilibrium? Is this a stable or an unstable
equilibrium (Section 9–4) in the plane?
3. Suppose electrons enter a uniform electric field midway
between two plates at an angle 
to the horizontal, as
shown in Fig. 16–70. The path is symmetrical, so they leave
at the same angle 
and just barely miss the top plate.
