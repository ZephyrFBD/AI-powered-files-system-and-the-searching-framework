 During expansion, the liquid refrigerant is released into an 
expansion chamber at low pressure, where it vaporizes. The 
vapor then undergoes compression at high pressure back 
to its liquid phase in a compression chamber. (a) What 
is the sign of q for the expansion? (b) What is the sign of 
q for the compression? (c) In a central air-conditioning 
system, one chamber is inside the home and the other is 
outside. Which chamber is where, and why? (d) Imagine 
that a sample of liquid refrigerant undergoes expansion 
followed by compression, so that it is back to its original 
state. Would you expect that to be a reversible process? 
(e) Suppose that a house and its exterior are both initially 
at 31 °C. Some time after the air conditioner is turned on, 
the house is cooled to 24 °C. Is this process spontaneous or 
nonspontaneous?
 [19.93]  Trouton’s rule states that for many liquids at their normal 
boiling points, the standard molar entropy of va
