 means that the
molecules are in a fixed position. As a result, the
entropy of the system is low.
2.
Allow the ice to melt at room temperature.
Describe changes in the motion and interactions
of water molecules before and after melting.
Explain where the energy came from whose
transfer produced melting. Predict the effect of
the energy transfer on the entropy on the system,
and justify your prediction.
3.
Heat the water until the temperature reaches
boiling point. Explain what happens to the
entropy of the system when the water is heated.
4.
Continue to heat the water at the constant
temperature of the boiling point. Describe
changes in the motion and interactions of water
molecules before and after boiling. Predict the
effect of the energy transfer on the entropy of the
system, and justify your prediction.
5.
[Extension/Connection] Molecules of water
have simple responses to heating: The molecules
move faster and interact less strongly with other
neighboring molecules. Consider the pr
