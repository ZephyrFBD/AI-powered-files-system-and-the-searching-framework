formation stored in DNA is so central
to cellular function, it makes intuitive sense that the cell would make mRNA copies of this information for protein synthesis,
while keeping the DNA itself intact and protected. The copying of DNA to RNA is relatively straightforward, with one
nucleotide being added to the mRNA strand for every nucleotide read in the DNA strand. The translation to protein is a bit
more complex because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence. However, the
translation to protein is still systematic and colinear, such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1, nucleotides 4
to 6 correspond to amino acid 2, and so on.
Figure 15.3 Instructions on DNA are transcribed onto messenger RNA. Ribosomes are able to read the genetic
information inscribed on a strand of messenger RNA and use this information to string amino acids together into a
protein.
The Genetic Code Is Degenerate and Universal
