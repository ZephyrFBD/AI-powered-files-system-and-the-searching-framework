 25°C. O21g2, 205.0 J>K; O31g2, 
237.6 J>K. (d) C (graphite) will have the higher standard enthalpy 
at 25 °C. C (diamond), 2.43 J>mol@K; C (graphite), 5.69 J  >  mol@K. 
19.49 For elements with similar structures, the heavier the atoms, 
the lower the vibrational frequencies at a given temperature. This 
means that more vibrations can be accessed at a particular tem-
perature, resulting in greater absolute entropy for the heavier ele-
ments. 19.51 (a) ∆S° = -120.5 J  >  K. ∆S° is negative because there 
are fewer moles of gas in the products. (b) ∆S° = +176.6 J  >  K. ∆S° 
is positive because there are more moles of gas in the products.  
(c) ∆S° = +152.39 J>K. ∆S° is positive because the product contains 
more total particles and more moles of gas. (d) ∆S° = +92.3 J>K. 
∆S° is positive because there are more moles of gas in the products. 
19.53 (a) Yes. ∆G = ∆H - T∆S (b) No. If ∆G is positive, the process 
is nonspontaneous. (c) No. There is no relationship between ∆G 
and rate of re
