e proteins that
metabolize lactose unless the substrate is available. This is also an
example of positive control because the expression of the genes is
induced by the presence of the substrate.
The Lac Operon in E. coli
Another important concept to appreciate from this model of gene
expression is that the promoter and operator of an operon are “unaware”
of what happens at another part of the DNA strand, unless the DNA
performs a specific activity on them. For example, if the gene to produce
human insulin were placed within a bacterium’s operon that produces
enzymes for metabolizing glucose, the insulin gene would also be
transcribed when glucose signals the transcription of the glucose
metabolizing genes. Scientists can then harvest the insulin from the
bacterium. This type of genetic manipulation has revolutionized the
discipline of molecular genetics.
CELL DIFFERENTIATION AND SPECIALIZATION
Every cell in multicellular organisms carries out very specific and diﬀerent
functions in diﬀ
