rue or false. 
 
If false, correct the statement to make it true: (a) The paths 
of neutral (uncharged) atoms are not affected by the magnet. 
(b) The height of each peak in the mass spectrum is inversely 
proportional to the mass of that isotope. (c) For a given 
 
element, the number of peaks in the spectrum is equal to the 
number of naturally occurring isotopes of that element.

abundances:

CHAPTER 2 Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
 2.40  Mass spectrometry is more often applied to molecules 
than to atoms. We will see in Chapter 3  that the molecular 
weight of a molecule is the sum of the atomic weights of the 
 
atoms in the molecule. The mass spectrum of H2 is taken 
 
under conditions that prevent decomposition into H atoms. 
The two nat
