 number of nuclei. For (b) we get from
the given half-life and use Eq. 30–3b for the rate of decay. For (c) and (d) we
use Eq. 30–5.
SOLUTION (a) The atomic mass is 13.0, so 13.0 g will contain 
(Avogadro’s number). We have only 
so the number of nuclei 
that we have initially is given by the ratio
Solving for 
we find 
(b) From Eq. 30–6,
