ht, and mineral nutrients, which provide the energy for living processes and the matter to make up organisms’ physical
structures. Other critical factors influencing community dynamics are the components of its physical and geographic
environment: a habitat’s latitude, amount of rainfall, topography (elevation), and available species. These are all important
environmental variables that determine which organisms can exist within a particular area.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 and Big Idea 4
of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP® exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
