The minus sign indicates that the force exerted by the car on the water is oppo-
site to the water’s original velocity. The car exerts a force of 30 N to the left to
stop the water, so by Newton’s third law, the water exerts a force of 30 N to the
right on the car.
NOTE Keep track of signs, although common sense helps too. The water is
moving to the right, so common sense tells us the force on the car must be to 
the right.
