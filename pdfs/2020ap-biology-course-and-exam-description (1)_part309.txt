of multiple-choice questions found on the exam.
1.	 Insulin is a protein hormone that is secreted in response to elevated blood 
glucose levels. When insulin binds to its receptors on liver cells, the activated 
receptors stimulate phosphorylation cascades that cause the translocation of 
glucose transporters to the plasma membrane.
Based on the information provided, which of the following best describes the 
role of insulin in this liver cell signal transduction pathway?
(A)	It acts as a ligand.
(B)	 It acts as a receptor.
(C)	 It acts as a secondary messenger.
(D)	It acts as a protein kinase.
2.	 Humans have a diploid number (“2n” ) of 46. Which of the following statements 
best predicts the consequence if meiosis did not occur during gametogenesis?
(A)	The gametes would get larger from one generation to the next.
(B)	 The chromosome number would double with each generation.
(C)	 The chromosome number would be halved with each generation.
(D)	The chromosome number would triple with e
