36. (II) Two straight parallel wires are separated by 7.0 cm.
There is a 2.0-A current flowing in the first wire. If the mag-
netic field strength is found to be zero between the two
wires at a distance of 2.2 cm from the first wire, what is the
magnitude and direction of the current in the second wire?
37. (II) Two long straight wires each carry a current I out of
the page toward the viewer, Fig. 20–56.
Indicate, with appropriate arrows, the direc-
tion of

plane of the page. State if the field is zero
at any of the points.
