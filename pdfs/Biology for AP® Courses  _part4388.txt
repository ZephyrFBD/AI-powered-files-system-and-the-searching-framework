nments have little chance for survival since their seeds are
low in energy content. Note that survival is not necessarily a function of energy stored in the seed itself.

Figure 36.14 (a) Elephants are considered K-selected species as they live long, mature late, and provide long-term
parental care to few offspring. Oak trees produce many offspring that do not receive parental care, but are considered
K-selected species based on longevity and late maturation. (b) Dandelions and jellyfish are both considered r-selected
species as they mature early, have short lifespans, and produce many
