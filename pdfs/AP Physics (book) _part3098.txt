49. (I) For the three hydrogen transitions indicated below, with
n being the initial state and 
being the final state, is the
transition an absorption or an emission? Which is higher, the
initial state energy or the final state energy of the atom? Finally,
which of these transitions involves the largest energy photon?
(a) 
(b)
(c)
50. (I) How much energy is needed to ionize a hydrogen atom
in the 
state?
51. (I) The second longest wavelength in the Paschen series in
hydrogen (Fig. 27–29) corresponds to what transition?
52. (I) Calculate the ionization energy of doubly ionized
lithium,
which has

53. (I) (a) Determine the wavelength of the second Balmer
line (
to 
transition) using Fig. 27–29. Deter-

and (c) the wavelength of the third Balmer line.
54. (I) Evaluate the Rydberg constant R using the Bohr model
