cording 
to the assumptions, its inverse function naturally described the opposite effect. Firstly, 
society influences the development of economy. In the early stage of social 
development, society drives little to economy, but with the progress of the society, 
economic development will improve rapidly. We select the exponential function to 
simulate. Ecological effect to the society is almost synchronous, which means if 
ecological development is well, society will develop excellent, too. Therefore, we 
select a linear function to simulate. Economic effect to the ecology is evident. 
Economy is the key to the early stage of the ecological development, while relatively 
well ecological development to some extent doesnâ€™t rely on the economy anymore 
and will enter into the steady stage. According to this, we select sine function to 
simulate.
