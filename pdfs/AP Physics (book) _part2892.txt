an inertial frame. The
Earth, though not quite an inertial frame (it rotates), is close enough that for
most purposes we can approximate it as an inertial frame. Rotating or otherwise
accelerating frames of reference are noninertial frames,‡ and won’t concern us in
this Chapter (they are dealt with in Einstein’s general theory of relativity, as we
will see in Chapter 33).
A reference frame that moves with constant velocity with respect to an
inertial frame is itself also an inertial frame, since Newton’s laws hold in it as well.
When we say that we observe or make measurements from a certain reference
frame, it means that we are at rest in that reference frame.
Both Galileo and Newton were aware of what we now call the relativity principle
applied to mechanics: that the basic laws of physics are the same in all inertial
reference frames. You may have recognized its validity in everyday life. For
example, objects move in the same way in a smoothly moving (constant-velocity)
train or air
