iCoO2 and into the graphite. During discharge, when the battery is 
producing electricity for use, the Li+ ions spontaneously migrate from the graphite 
anode through the electrolyte to the cathode, enabling electrons to flow through 
the external circuit (Figure 20.21).
hydrogen Fuel Cells
The thermal energy released by burning fuels can be converted to electrical energy. The 
thermal energy may convert water to steam, for instance, which drives a turbine that 
in turn drives an electrical generator. Typically, a maximum of only 40% of the energy 
from combustion is converted to electricity in this manner; the remainder is lost as heat. 
The direct production of electricity from fuels by a voltaic cell could, in principle, yield

When a Li-ion battery is fully discharged, the cathode has an empirical 
formula of LiCoO2. What is the oxidation number of cobalt in this state? 
Does the oxidation numb
