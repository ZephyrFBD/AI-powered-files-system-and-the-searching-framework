Some phenotypic variations significantly increase or decrease the fitness of an
organism or a population.
5. Artificial Selection
Humans breed plants and animals by seeking individuals with desired
traits as breeding stock. This is known as artificial selection. Racehorses
are bred for speed, and laying hens are bred to produce more and larger
eggs. Humans have bred cabbage, brussels sprouts, kale, kohlrabi,
cauliflower, and broccoli all from the wild mustard plant by selecting for
different traits.
PRESERVING VARIATION IN A POPULATION
Variation in a population is necessary in order for a population to evolve
as the environment changes. Although Darwin could not explain the origin
of variation, he knew that variation exists in every population. A good
example of this is the existence
