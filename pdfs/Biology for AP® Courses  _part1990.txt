the universality of DNA as the genetic material and in the near universality of
the genetic code and the machinery of DNA replication and expression. Fundamental divisions in life between the three
domains are reflected in major structural differences in otherwise conservative structures such as the components of
ribosomes and the structures of membranes. In general, the relatedness of groups of organisms is reflected in the similarity
of their DNA sequences—exactly the pattern that would be expected from descent and diversification from a common
ancestor.
DNA sequences have also shed light on some of the mechanisms of evolution. For example, it is clear that the evolution of
new functions for proteins commonly occurs after gene duplication events that allow the free modification of one copy by
mutation, selection, or drift (changes in a population’s gene pool resulting from chance), while the second copy continues
to produce a functional protein.
