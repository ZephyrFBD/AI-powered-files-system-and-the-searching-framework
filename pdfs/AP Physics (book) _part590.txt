FIGURE 6–8 A moving hammer
strikes a nail and comes to rest. The
hammer exerts a force F on the 
nail; the nail exerts a force 
on
the hammer (Newton’s third law).
The work done on the nail by the
hammer is positive
The work done on the hammer by
the nail is negative AW

How much net work is required to accelerate a 1000-kg car from 
to 
(Fig. 6–9)?
APPROACH A car is a complex system. The engine turns the wheels and tires
which push against the ground, and the ground pushes back (see Example 4–4).
We aren’t interested right now in those complications. Instead, we can get a
use
