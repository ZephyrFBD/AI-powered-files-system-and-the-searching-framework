▲ Figure 20.14 Concentration cell based on Ni2+-Ni cell reaction. (a) Concentrations of Ni2+1aq2  
in the two half-cells are unequal, and the cell generates an electrical current and a voltage. (b) The  
cell operates until 3Ni2+4 is the same in the two half-cells, at which point the cell has reached  
equilibrium and the emf goes to zero.

the cell operates under nonstandard conditions because the concentration of Ni2+1aq2 is 
not 1 M in both half-cells. In fact, the cell operates until 3Ni2+4anode
