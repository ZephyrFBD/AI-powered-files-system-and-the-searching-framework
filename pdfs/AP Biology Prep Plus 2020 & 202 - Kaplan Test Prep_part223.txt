(A)
Bacteriophage, since it infects bacteria
(B)
Provirus, since it was found in a bacterium
(C)
Viroid, since it replicates within mammals

12. A student is performing a lab, in which she attempts to transfer a
gene that confers ampicillin resistance to a culture of E. coli. She
adds 10 microliters of the 0.005 μg/μL plasmid solution to a tube
of E. coli. 150 microliters of the resulting 600 μL suspension are
then placed on agar plates and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours.
Aȇer the procedure is finished, the student identifies 35 individual
colonies that have grown on the plate. She then calculates the
transformation eﬀiciency in order to determine how eﬀective she
was in getting the plasmids carrying ampicillin resistance into the
host bacterial cells. Based on the information provided above,
calculate the transformation eﬀiciency of the experiment. Give
your answer to the nearest whole number with units of colonies
per microgram of plasmid.
