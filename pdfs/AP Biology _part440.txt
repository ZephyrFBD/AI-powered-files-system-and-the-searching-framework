d increase the
frequency of the less common ones. In predator-prey relationships,
predators develop a search image, or standard representation of prey, that
enables them to hunt a particular kind of prey effectively. If the prey
individuals differ, the most common type will be preyed upon
disproportionately while the less common individuals will be preyed upon
to a lesser extent. Since these rare individuals have the selective
advantage, they will become more common for a time, will lose their
selective advantage, and will eventually be selected against.
8. Evolutionary Neutral Traits
Evolutionary neutral traits are traits that seem to have no selective
advantage. One example is the different blood types in humans. Scientists
do not understand where they evolved from or why they have remained
(been conserved) in the human population. Perhaps they actually influence
survival and reproductive success in ways that are difficult to perceive or
measure.
