ive immune systems
respond to a laceration, such as an injury from falling on a barbed-wire
fence. (4 points)
Description (1 point each, 4 points maximum)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The innate immune system provides immediate defense against a foreign
invader. The first line of defense is the skin, which provides a protective
barrier around the body. When a laceration is made in the skin, the
protective barrier is broken. The body responds with an inflammatory
response, releasing the chemical histamine. This release increases the
permeability of blood vessels and signals blood vessels to dilate, which in
turn causes a rush of blood to the area. White blood cells called
neutrophils surround and engulf any foreign organisms via phagocytosis.
The innate immune system provides immediate/initial defense against an antigen.
The body responds with an inflammatory response and releases histamine.
White blood cells capture and engulf antigens via phagocytosis.
