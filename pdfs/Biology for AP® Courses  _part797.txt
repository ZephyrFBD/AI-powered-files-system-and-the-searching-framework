2.5 The student is able to construct explanations of the mechanisms and structural features
of cells that allow organisms to capture, store, or use free energy.
You have read that nearly all of the energy used by living cells comes to them in the bonds of the sugar, glucose. Glycolysis
is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism. Nearly all living organisms carry
out glycolysis as part of their metabolism. The process does not use oxygen and is therefore anaerobic. Glycolysis takes
place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Glucose enters heterotrophic cells in two wa
