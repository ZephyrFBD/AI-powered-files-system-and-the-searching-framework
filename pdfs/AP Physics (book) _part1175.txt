amount of damping
(i.e., critical) is desired. Well-designed damping is needed for all kinds of applica-
tions. Large buildings, especially in California, are now built (or retrofitted) with
huge dampers to reduce possible earthquake damage (Fig. 11–17).
FIGURE 11–17 These huge dampers 
placed in a building look a lot like 
huge automobile shock absorbers,
and they serve a similar purpose—to
reduce the amplitude and the 
acceleration of movement when the 
shock of an earthquake hits.

1–6 Forced Oscillations; Resonance
When an oscillating system is set into motion, it oscillates at its natural frequency
(Eqs. 11–6b and 11–11b). However, a system may have an external force applied
to it that has its own particular frequency. Then we have a forced oscillation.
For example, we might pull the mass on the spring of Fig. 11–1 back and forth
at an externally applied frequency f. The mass then oscillates at the external fre-
