 energy, as the following calculation shows. The total energy equals the
sum of the kinetic and potential energies. The potential energy of the electron is
given by
where V is the potential due to a point charge 
as
given by Eq. 17–5:
So
The total energy 
for an electron in the nth orbit of radius 
is the sum of the
kinetic and potential energies:
When we substitute v from Eq. 27–11 and 
from Eq. 27–12 into this equation,
we obtain
(27;15a)
If we evaluate the constant term in Eq. 27–15a and convert it to electron volts, as
is customary in atomic physics, we obtain
(27;15b)
The lowest energy level 
for hydrogen 
is
Since 
appears in the denominator of Eq. 27–15b, the energies of the larger
orbits in hydrogen 
are given by
For example,
We see that not only are the orbit radii quantized, but from Eqs. 27–15, so is the
energy. The quantum number n that labels the orbit radii also labels the energy
levels. The lowest energy level or energy state has energy 
and is called the
ground state. T
