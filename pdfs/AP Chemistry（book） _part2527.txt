hus, pure water consists 
almost entirely of H2O molecules and is an extremely poor conductor of electricity. Nev-
ertheless, the autoionization of water is very important, as we will soon learn.
The Ion Product of Water
The equilibrium-constant expression for the autoionization of water is
 
Kc = 3H3O+43OH -4 
[16.13]
The term 3H2O4 is excluded from the equilibrium-constant expression because we 
exclude the concentrations of pure solids and liquids.

For the following proton-transfer reaction, use Figure 16.4 to predict whether the equilibrium lies to the left 1Kc 6 12 or to the 
right 1Kc 7 12:
HSO4
-1aq2 + CO3
2 -1aq2 ∆ SO4
2 -1aq2 + HCO3

Predicting the Position of a Proton-Transfer Equilibrium
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to predict whether an equilibrium lies to the 
right, favoring products, or to the left, favoring reactants.
