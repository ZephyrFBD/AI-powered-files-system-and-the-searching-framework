Ea increases, k decreases because the fraction of molecules that possess the required energy 
is smaller. Thus, at fixed values of T and A, the rate constant decreases as Ea increases.
*Because collision frequency increases with temperature, A also has some temperature depen-
dence, but this dependence is much smaller than the exponential term. Therefore, A is consid-
ered to be approximately constant.
