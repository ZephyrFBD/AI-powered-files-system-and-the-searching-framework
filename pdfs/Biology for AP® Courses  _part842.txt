or is a molecule other than oxygen for NAD+
production,
whereas under anaerobic conditions the electron acceptor is oxygen.
d.
NAD+
is formed by a fermentation process in anaerobic conditions whereas in aerobic respiration it is
formed by the breakdown of pyruvate into lactic acid or alcohol.
Lactic Acid Fermentation
The fermentation method used by animals and certain bacteria, like those in yogurt, is lactic acid fermentation (Figure
7.15). This type of fermentation is used routinely in mammalian red blood cells and in skeletal muscle that has an
insufficient oxygen supply to allow aerobic respiration to continue (that is, in muscles used to the point of fatigue). In
muscles, lactic acid accumulation must be removed by the blood circulation and the lactate brought to the liver for further
metabolism. The chemical reactions of lactic acid fermentation are the following:
