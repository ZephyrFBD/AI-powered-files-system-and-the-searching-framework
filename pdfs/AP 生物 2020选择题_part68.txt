4. Daphnia longicephala is a freshwater crustacean that can detect chemical cues produced by the predator 
Notonecta glauca. Researchers raised Daphnia clones and observed that those exposed to Notonecta chemical 
cues during their development produced larger protective crests, as described in Figures 1 and 2. Crest height 
and width are measured as ratios to body length. The increase in the size of the crest width and height is not 
associated with a corresponding change to the Daphniaâ€™s genome. Researchers hypothesize that growing a 
crest is energetically costly, so Daphnia do not develop the large crests in the absence of Notonecta.

chemical cues
