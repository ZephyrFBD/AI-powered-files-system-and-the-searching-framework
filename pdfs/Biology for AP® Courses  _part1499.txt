Figure 14.6 The work of pioneering scientists (a) James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maclyn McCarty led to our present
day understanding of DNA. Scientist Rosalind Franklin discovered (b) the X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA, which
helped to elucidate its double helix structure. (credit a: modification of work by Marjorie McCarty, Public Library of

Watson and Crick proposed that DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-handed
helix. Base pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine; namely, A pairs with T and G pairs with C. Adenine
and thymine are complementary base pairs, and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs. The base pairs
are stabilized by hydrogen bonds; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine form three
hydrogen bonds. The two strands are anti-parallel in nature; that is, the 3' end of one strand faces the 5' end of t
