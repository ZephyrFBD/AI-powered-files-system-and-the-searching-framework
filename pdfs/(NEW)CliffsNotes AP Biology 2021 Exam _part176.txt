se include chlorophyll a and b and various
carotenoids. The purpose of a variety of pigments is to absorb light energy (photons) of different wavelengths. The
absorption spectrums of the pigments overlap so that they maximize the energy absorbed. When light energy is
absorbed, the pigment becomes energized. The energy is then bounced around among pigments until it is absorbed
by either of two special kinds of chlorophyll a, P700or
P680.
 
P700 and P680are organized into separate photosystems (pigment systems)
 
I and II. Cyclic photophosphorylation involves photosystem I. In cyclic photophosphorylation, the energy absorbed
by the pigment system is
 
captured by the P700. As a result, two electrons are excited to a higher
energy level, where they are absorbed by a primary electron acceptor. From here, the electrons are passed through an
electron transport chain from electron acceptor to electron acceptor (some of which are cytochromes). During this
transit, the energy loss of the electr
