As you continued to travel north, you would see these broad-leaved evergreen plants eventually give rise to seasonally dry
forests with scattered trees. You would also begin to notice changes in temperature and moisture. At about 30 degrees north,
these forests would give way to deserts, which are characterized by low precipitation.
Moving farther north, you would see that deserts are replaced by grasslands or prairies. Eventually, grasslands are replaced
by deciduous temperate forests. These deciduous forests give way to the boreal forests found in the subarctic, the area south
of the Arctic Circle. Finally, you would reach the Arctic tundra, which is found at the most northern latitudes. This trek north
reveals gradual changes in both climate and the types of organisms that have adapted to environmental factors associated
with ecosystems found at different latitudes. However, different ecosystems exist at the same latitude due in part to abiotic
factors such as jet streams, the Gu
