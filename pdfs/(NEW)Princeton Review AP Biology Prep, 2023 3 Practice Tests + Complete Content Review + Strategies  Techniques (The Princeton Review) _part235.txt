e most important points from the first part of photosynthesis:
P680 in photosystem II captures light and passes excited electrons down an electron transport chain to produce
ATP.
P700 in photosystem I captures light and passes excited electrons down an electron transport chain to produce
NADPH.
A molecule of water is split by sunlight, releasing electrons, hydrogen, and free O2.
The light-dependent reactions occur in the grana of chloroplasts, where the thylakoids are found. Remember:
the light-absorbing pigments and enzymes for the light-dependent reactions are found within the thylakoids.
Most plants follow this electron flow, which is called linear, or noncyclic. However, some plants (such as C4 plants
discussed below) perform cyclic electron flow instead. Cyclic photophosphorylation is similar to noncyclic, but
generates only ATP, and no NADPH. It takes place only at photosystem I: once an electron is displaced from the
photosystem, it is passed down electron acceptor molecules and
