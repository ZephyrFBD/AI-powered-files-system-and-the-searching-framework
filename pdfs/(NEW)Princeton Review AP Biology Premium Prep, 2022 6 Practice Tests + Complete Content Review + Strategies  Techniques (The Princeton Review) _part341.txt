point is called the start site.
When transcription begins, RNA polymerase travels along and builds an RNA that is complementary to the template
strand of DNA. It is just like DNA replication except when DNA has an adenine, the RNA can’t add a thymine since
RNA doesn’t have thymine. Instead, the enzyme adds a uracil.
Once RNA polymerase finishes adding on nucleotides and reaches the termination sequence, it separates from the
DNA template, completing the process of transcription. The new RNA is now a transcript or a copy of the sequence
of nucleotides based on the DNA strand. Note that the freshly synthesized RNA is complementary to the template
strand, but it is identical to the coding strand (with the substitution of uracil for thymine).
RNA Processing
In prokaryotes, the mRNA is now complete, but in eukaryotes the RNA must be processed before it can leave the
nucleus.
In eukaryotes, the freshly transcribed RNA is called an hnRNA (heterogeneous nuclear RNA) and it contains both
codi
