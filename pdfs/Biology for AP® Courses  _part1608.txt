nt of more modern,
rapid, and cheap methods of sequencing. The challenge of
the $1,000 in one-day sequencing of the human genome
was achieved in 2016 by next-generation sequencing
(NGS), a “catch-all” term describing several sequencing
methods.

A. Using the diagrams shown above for reference, explain
the effect of the addition of dideoxynucleotides on chain
growth of the DNA strand that is copied during
sequencing in terms of the structures of dideoxyribose and
deoxyribose.
B. Suppose that a single strand to be sequenced is
5’CGAGTACG3’. In the presence of each of the four
deoxynucleotides and the dideoxynucleotide ddCTP,
describe the strands that would be formed from this
template. Include in your description an annotation
indicating the 3’ and 5’ ends of the fragments resulting
from the procedure.
