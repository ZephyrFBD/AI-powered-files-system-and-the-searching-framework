Long-term Stress Response
Long-term stress response differs from short-term stress response. The body cannot sustain the bursts of energy mediated
by epinephrine and norepinephrine for long times. Instead, other hormones come into play. In a long-term stress response,
the hypothalamus triggers the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland. The adrenal cortex is stimulated by ACTH
to release steroid hormones called corticosteroids. Corticosteroids turn on transcription of certain genes in the nuclei of
target cells. They change enzyme concentrations in the cytoplasm and affect cellular metabolism. There are two main
corticosteroids: glucocorticoids such as
