changes in the environment. For example, in pre-industrial
England, white moths of one species were camouflaged and
were selected for, while dark moths were visible, more often
eaten by predators, and selected against. However, in post-
industrial England, dark moths were camouflaged and were
selected for, while light moths were more visible and eaten by
predators, making them selected against. The change in the
population was brought about by a change in the environment:
industrialization caused excessive soot pollution that cover
everything and affected which traits were selected for and
which traits were selected against.
Refer to the graph below, which demonstrates disruptive or
diversifying selection in response to a change in the
environment.
