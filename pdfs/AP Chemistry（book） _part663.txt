 If 3.45 mL of vinegar needs 42.5 mL of 0.115 M NaOH to 
reach the equivalence point in a titration, how many grams 
of acetic acid are in a 1.00-qt sample of this vinegar?
 4.85 A 4.36-g sample of an unknown alkali metal hydroxide is dis-
solved in 100.0 mL of water. An acid–base indicator is added, 
and the resulting solution is titrated with 2.50 M HCl(aq) 
solution. The indicator changes color, signaling that the 
equivalence point has been reached, after 17.0 mL of the hy-
drochloric acid solution has been added. (a) What is the mo-
lar mass of the metal hydroxide? (b) What is the identity of 
the alkali metal cation: Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, or Cs+?
 4.86 An 8.65-g sample of an unknown group 2A metal hydroxide 
is dissolved in 85.0 mL of water. An acid–base indicator is 
added and the resulting solution is titrated with 2.50 M 
HCl(aq) solution. The indicator changes color,
