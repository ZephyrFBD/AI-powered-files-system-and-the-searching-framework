Another type of evidence for evolution is the presence of structures in organisms that share the same basic form. For
example, the bones in the appendages of a human, dog, bird, and whale all share the same overall construction (Figure 18.7)
resulting from their origin in the appendages of a common ancestor. Over time, evolution led to changes in the shapes and
sizes of these bones in different species, but they have maintained the same overall layout. Scientists call these synonymous
parts homologous structures.
Figure 18.7 The similar construction of these appendages indicates that these organisms share a common ancestor.
Some structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all, and appear to be residual parts from a past common
ancestor. These unused structures without function are called vestigial structures. Examples of vestigial structures include
wings on flightless birds, leaves on some cacti, and hind leg bones in whales.
