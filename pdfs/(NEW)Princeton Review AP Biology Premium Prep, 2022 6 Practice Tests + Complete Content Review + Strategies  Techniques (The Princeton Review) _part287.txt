the traits associated with those genes are
inherited. Within a chromosome, there are many genes, and each can contribute to a different trait. For example,
in pea plants, there’s a gene on a chromosome that codes for seed coat characteristics. The position of a gene on
a chromosome is called a locus.
Diploid organisms (organisms that have two sets of chromosomes) usually have two copies of each gene, one on
each homologous chromosome. Homologous chromosomes are two copies or versions of the same chromosome
in a diploid cell or organism. Humans have 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes.
The two gene copies may be different from one another—that is, they may be alternate versions, or alleles, of
the same gene. For example, if we’re talking about the height of a pea plant, there’s an allele for tall and an
allele for short. In other words, both alleles are alternate forms of the gene for height.
Overall then, homologous chromosomes are the same size and shape, and
contain the same genes. Ho
