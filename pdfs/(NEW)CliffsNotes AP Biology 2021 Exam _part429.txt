s of thousands
to millions of years. Fossil evidence provides snapshots of the evolutionary process, revealing only major changes in
groups of organisms. That intermediate stages of evolution are not represented by fossils merely testifies to the
incompleteness of the available fossil record.
Punctuated equilibrium argues that evolutionary history consists of geologically long periods of stasis with little or
no evolution, interrupted, or “punctuated,” by geologically short periods of rapid evolution ranging over tens of
thousands of years. The fossil history, then, should consist of fossils mostly from the extended periods of stasis with
few, if any, fossils available from the short bursts of evolution. Thus, in this theory, the absence of fossils revealing
intermediate stages of evolution is considered data that confirm rapid evolutionary events.
The Origin of Life
A topic related to evolution is the study of how life began, or chemical
evolution. This kind of evolution describes the
