oth eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Eukaryotic
ribosomes (80s) are slightly larger than prokaryotic ribosomes (70s). The “s” is
a unit of measurement used to compare sizes of small things. In general,
prokaryotic ribosomes are exclusively found freely in the cytoplasm, whereas
eukaryotic ribosomes can also be found attached to the endoplasmic
reticulum. The fact that both eukaryotes and prokaryotes possess ribosomes
underlines the common ancestry of all known life.
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a continuous channel that extends into many regions of the cytoplasm and
provides mechanical support while aiding in intracellular transport. The region of the ER that is attached to the
nucleus and “studded” with ribosomes is called the rough ER (RER), which compartmentalizes the cell. Proteins
generated in the rough ER are trafficked to or across the plasma membrane, or they are used to build Golgi bodies,
lysosomes, or the ER. The region of the ER that lacks ribosom
