oyote populations and
provide more abundant resources to the guild of carrion eaters. Reducing elk populations has allowed revegetation of
riparian areas, which has increased the diversity of species in that habitat. Decreasing the coyote population has increased
the populations of species that were previously suppressed by this predator. The number of species of carrion eaters has
increased because of the predatory activities of the wolves. In this habitat, the wolf is a keystone species, meaning a species
that is instrumental in maintaining diversity in an ecosystem. Removing a keystone species from an ecological community
may cause a collapse in diversity. The results from the Yellowstone experiment suggest that restoring a keystone species can
have the effect of restoring biodiversity in the community. Ecologists have argued for the identification of keystone species
where possible and for focusing protection efforts on those species; likewise, it also makes sense to attempt to ret
