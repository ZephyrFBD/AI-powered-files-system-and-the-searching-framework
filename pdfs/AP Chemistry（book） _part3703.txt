Give It Some Thought
Can a trigonal planar complex exhibit geometric isomerism?
The Lewis structure :C ‚ O: indicates that the CO molecule has two lone pairs of electrons. When CO binds to a transition-metal 
atom, it nearly always does so by using the C lone pair. How many geometric isomers are there for tetracarbonyldichloroiron(II)?
Sample Exercise 23.4 
Determining the Number of Geometric Isomers
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the name of a complex containing only 
monodentate ligands, and we must determine the number of iso-
mers the complex can form.
Plan We can count the number of ligands to determine the
