22.7 ∣ Nitrogen
Nitrogen constitutes 78% by volume of Earth’s atmosphere, where it occurs as N2 mol-
ecules. Although nitrogen is a key element in living organisms, compounds of nitrogen 
are not abundant in Earth’s crust. The major natural deposits of nitrogen compounds are 
those of KNO3 (saltpeter) in India and NaNO3 (Chile saltp
