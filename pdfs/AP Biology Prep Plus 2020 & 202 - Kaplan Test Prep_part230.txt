Plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that carry genes that can
enhance bacterial survival. The exchange of plasmids between
bacteria in processes of horizontal gene transfer allows for the spread
of traits like antibiotic resistance. Plasmids can also be transferred
vertically when a bacterium divides and replicates not only its
chromosome but also any plasmids it contains. (C) is thus correct. (A)
is incorrect because flagella are structures used for movement, not
gene transmission. Pili are hair-like structures that allow for adhesion
to other cells. Though they can be used in the process of conjugation,
such horizontal gene transfer cannot occur without the actual genes,
oȇen contained in plasmids, which make plasmids the more important
structure for spreading antibiotic resistance. Thus, (B) is incorrect. (D)
is incorrect because chlorosomes are complexes used in
photosynthesis.
