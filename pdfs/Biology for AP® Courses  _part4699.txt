heat.
c.
Both endotherms and ectotherms use the same
energy from food.
d.

30. Compare the three types of ecosystem pyramids and
how well they describe ecosystem structure. Identify
which ones can be inverted and give a specific example of
an inverted pyramid for each.
a.
The three types of ecosystem pyramids are
pyramids of energy, number and biomass out of
which number and energy pyramids can be
inverted. Examples of inverted pyramids of
number and energy are temperate forests in
summer and phytoplankton in the English
Channel respectively.
