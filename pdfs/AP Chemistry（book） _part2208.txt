ng how changes in the concen-
tration change the rate. (b) Once we know m and n, we can use the 
rate law and one of the sets of data to determine the rate constant 
k. (c) Upon determining both the rate constant and the reaction 
orders, we can use the rate law with the given concentrations to 
calculate rate.
Inserting values of rate and concentration from the  
experiments gives:
The only way this equation can be true is if n = 0. Therefore, 
the rate law is zero order in B, which means that the rate is 
independent of [B].
Inserting values of rate and concentration from the  
experiments gives:
16.0 * 10-5 M>s
4.0 * 10-5 M>s
=
k30.200M4m30.100M4n
k30.100M4m30.100M4n
4 = (2)m
 
In experiments 1 and 3, [B] is held constant, so these data allow 
us to determine the order of the rate law with respect to [A].
 
Combining these results, we arrive at the rate law:
Rate = k3A423B40 = k3A42
 
Because the rate increases by a factor of four when [A] is dou-
bled, we can conclude that m = 2 an
