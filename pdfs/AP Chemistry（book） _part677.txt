s per million 
(ppm) of NH3 in the air in a work environment [that is, 50 
molecules of NH31g2 for every million molecules in the air]. 
Air from a manufacturing operation was drawn through a 
solution containing 1.00 * 102 mL of 0.0105 M HCl. The 
NH3 reacts with HCl according to:
NH31aq2 + HCl1aq2 ยก NH4Cl1aq2
 
 After drawing air through the acid solution for 10.0 min at a 
rate of 10.0 L>min, the acid was titrated. The remaining acid 
needed 13.1 mL of 0.0588 M NaOH to reach the equivalence 
point. (a) How many grams of NH3 were drawn into the 
acid solution? (b) How many ppm of NH3 were in the air? 
(Air has a density of 1.20 g>L and an average molar mass of 
29.0 g>mol under the conditions of the experiment.) (c) Is 
this manufacturer in compliance with regulations?
 4.106 (a) By titration, 15.0 mL of 0.1008 M sodium hydroxide is needed 
to neutralize a 0.2053-g sample of a weak acid. What is the molar 
mass of the acid if it is monoprotic? (b) An elemental analysis of 
the acid i
