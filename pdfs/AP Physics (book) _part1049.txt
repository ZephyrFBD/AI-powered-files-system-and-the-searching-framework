the density can be determined using Archimedes’
principle, as the following Example shows. The quantity 
is called the apparent
weight in water, and is what a scale reads when the object is submerged in water
(see Fig. 10–13);
equals the true weight 
minus the buoyant force.

Archimedes: Is the crown gold? When a crown of mass
14.7 kg is submerged in water, an accurate scale reads only 13.4 kg. Is the crown
made of gold?
APPROACH If the crown is gold, its density and specific gravity must be very high,
(see Section 10–2 and Table 10–1). We determine the specific gravity
using Archimedes’ principle and the two free-body diagrams shown in Fig. 10–13.
SOLUTION The apparent weight of the submerged object (the crown) is 
(what the scale reads), and is the force pulling down on the scale hook. By
Newton’s third law,
equals the force 
that the scale exerts on the crown in
Fig. 10–13b. The sum of the forces on the crown is zero, so 
equ
