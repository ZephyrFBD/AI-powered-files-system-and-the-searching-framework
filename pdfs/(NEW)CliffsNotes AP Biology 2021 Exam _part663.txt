 size will decrease. On the other hand, when births and deaths are equal, the growth rate is zero and the
population size remains constant.
Population ecologists describe two general patterns of population growth, as follows:
 
1. Exponential growth occurs whenever the reproductive rate, as described by the equation
 
is greater than zero. On a graph where population size is plotted against time, a plot of exponential growth
rises quickly, forming a J-shaped curve (Figure 16-3):

2. Logistic growth occurs when limiting factors restrict the size of the population to the carrying capacity of the
habitat. In this case, the equation for reproductive rate given above is modified as follows:
K represents the carrying capacity. In logistic growth, when the size of the population increases, its reproductive rate
decreases until, at carrying capacity (that is, when N = K), the reproductive rate is zero and the population size
stabilizes. A plot of logistic growth forms an S-shaped,
