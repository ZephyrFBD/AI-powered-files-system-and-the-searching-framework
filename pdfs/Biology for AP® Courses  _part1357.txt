ic calculations. For
instance, for a tetrahybrid cross between individuals that are heterozygotes for all four genes, and in which all four genes
are sorting independently and in a dominant and recessive pattern, what proportion of the offspring will be expected to
be homozygous recessive for all four alleles? Rather than writing out every possible genotype, we can use the probability
method. We know that for each gene, the fraction of homozygous recessive offspring will be 1/4. Therefore, multiplying this
fraction for each of the four genes, (1/4) × (1/4) × (1/4) × (1/4), we determine that 1/256 of the offspring will be quadruply
homozygous recessive.
For the same tetrahybrid cross, what is the expected proportion of offspring that have the dominant phenotype at all four
loci? We can answer this question using phenotypic proportions, but let’s do it the hard way—using genotypic proportions.
The question asks for the proportion of offspring that are 1) homozygous dominant at A or heter
