way to support the hypothesis that snakes and lizards share a
common ancestor would be to find more intermediate forms, such as
snakes with hind limbs, in the fossil record. (A) is thus correct. (B) is
incorrect because it provides an example of Lamarckian evolution, in
which the use (or disuse) of a trait causes it to develop (or atrophy);
this conception of evolution has been discredited. (C) is incorrect
because it provides less solid evidence of common ancestry than does
(A); it is not much diï¬€erent than the evidence already provided in the
question stem concerning embryonic hind limb buds in snakes. (D) is
incorrect because this morphological similarity does not necessarily
indicate a close relationship between the species; all reptiles are
covered in scales.

In the situation described in the question stem, parrotbills will
experience a selective pressure in favor of being able to recognize the
cuckoo eggs, so they can remove them from their nests and
