ialized protein channels called 
aquaporins. Most ions move through protein channels, while larger molecules, such as 
carbohydrates, are carried by transport proteins. 
The simplest form of movement is diffusion, in which solutes move from an area 
of high concentration to an area of low concentration; diffusion is directly related to 
molecular kinetic energy. Diffusion does not require energy input. The movement of 
a solute from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration requires 
energy input in the form of ATP and protein carriers called pumps. 
Water moves through membranes by diffusion; this process is called osmosis. Like 
solutes, water moves down its concentration gradient. Water moves from areas of 
high potential (high water concentration) and low solute concentration to areas of 
low potential (low water concentration) and high solute concentration. In walled cells, 
osmosis is affected not only by the solute concentration but also by the resistance to
