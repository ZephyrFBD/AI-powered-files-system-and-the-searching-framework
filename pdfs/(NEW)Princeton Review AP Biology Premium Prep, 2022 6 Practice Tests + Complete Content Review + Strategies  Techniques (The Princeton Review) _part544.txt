The first thing you need to do is sort out the alleles for each gene. Since the F1 generation had long
phenotypes, you know these must be dominant to the short phenotypes. Let’s use:
L = long leaves
l = short leaves
S = long shoots
s = stubby shoots
The parental cross must have been LLSS × llss, and all F1 plants were LlSs. The null hypothesis (H0) is
that the two genes are segregating independently. This means the expected ratio of F2 phenotypes will be
9LS:3Ls:3lS:1ls. Since 1,000 F2 plants were generated, you can expect:
P(long leaves, long shoots) = P(LS phenotype) = 
 × 1,000 = 562.5
P(long leaves, stubby shoots) = P(Ls phenotype) = 
 × 1,000 = 187.5
P(short leaves, long shoots) = P(lS phenotype) = 
 × 1,000 = 187.5
P(short leaves, stubby shoots) = P(ls phenotype) = 
 × 1,000 = 62.5
Next, generate a chart:
χ2 = 1,911.4 and degrees of freedom = # of possibilities – 1 = 4 – 1 = 3 (eliminate (C) and (D)). Using p =
0.05, you get a critical value of 7.82. Since χ2 > CV, r
