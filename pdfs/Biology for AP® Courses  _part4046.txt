34.3 | Human Reproductive Anatomy and
Gametogenesis
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are the features of the human male and female reproductive anatomies?
•
What are the events associated with the human sexual response?
•
What are the differences and similarities between spermatogenesis and oogenesis?
Connection for AP® Courses
Much of the information in this section is not within the scope for AP®. You do not need to match a list of the different

females to mate, fertilize internally, and support the growth and development of offspring. The section provides an
opportunity to review the process of meiosis that we first explored in a previous chapter.
