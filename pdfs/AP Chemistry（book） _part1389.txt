Shapes of Larger Molecules
Although the molecules and ions we have considered contain only a single central atom, the 
VSEPR model can be extended to more complex molecules. Consider the acetic acid molecule:

Comment The experimentally observed structure is shown on the 
right. We can infer that the nonbonding electron domain occu-
pies an equatorial position, as predicted. The axial and equatorial 
S ¬ F bonds are slightly bent away from the nonbonding domain, 
suggesting that the bonding domains are “pushed” by the non-
bonding domain, w
