enes that increase muscle mass are turned on. In
hair cells, genes for the protein keratin (what hair is made of) are turned
on.
To stress the importance of receptors, let’s look at an example. There is
a condition in humans called androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS).
People with this condition are born with the XY genotype but lack
testosterone receptors in all their cells. (They do, however, possess
receptors for another hormone that inhibits normal development of internal
female reproductive structures.) So although testosterone is produced in
normal amounts, individuals with AIS do not develop male reproductive
ducts, male genitals, or male secondary sexual characteristics. The result is
a genetically XY individual who appears female but who has internal
testes.
EPINEPHRINE
Epinephrine “tells” the liver to release glucose. The hormone epinephrine
acts as the first messenger when it binds to and activates G protein
membrane receptors on the surface of liver cells. The activated G
