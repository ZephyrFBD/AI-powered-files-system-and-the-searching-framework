 life on Earth. One of 
the key driving forces of evolution is natural selection, which is differential reproduction 
in a population â€” some organisms in a population may reproduce more than others 
and leave more viable offspring in the next population or generation. Differential 
reproduction results in a population with a genetic makeup that is different from that 
of the previous population. Thus, populations may change over time. This process of 
change is evolution. With natural selection, environmental factors play a key role in 
determining which organisms reproduce and how many of their offspring survive. 
In artificial selection, humans determine which organisms reproduce, allowing some 
individuals to reproduce more than others. What will happen to a population of these 
organisms over time when exposed to artificial selection?
For the first part of this investigation, you and your classmates will perform one 
round of artificial selection on a population of Wisconsin Fast P
