trophic bacteria L. ferrooxidans is isolated
and cultured from a sample of the Rio Tinto water. Researchers
determine the rates of synthesis of several organic compounds
found in the L. ferrooxidans in water from the Rio Tinto and in a
nutrient-rich water solution, as show in the graph below.
Based on the results shown, which of the following elements is
most likely deficient in the river?

10. Researchers begin to study the metabolic strategies used by the
various eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms in the river. Which
of the following could be a possible explanation for their
observation that not all of the organisms use the same strategies
to meet their energy requirements for growth, reproduction, and
homeostasis?
Prokaryotes do not possess introns within their DNA, while
most eukaryotes contain many of these noncoding sections
of DNA.
