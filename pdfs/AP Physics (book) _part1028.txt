EXERCISE A Return to Chapter-Opening Question 1, page 260, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.
Equation 10–3a is extremely useful. It is valid for fluids whose density is 
constant and does not change with depth—that is, if the fluid is incompressible.
This is usually a good approximation for liquids (although at great depths in the
ocean, the density of water is increased some by compression due to the 
great weight of water above).
If the density of a fluid does vary, a useful relation can be found by considering a
thin horizontal slab of the fluid of thickness

top of the slab, at depth 
is 
The pressure on the bottom of the slab
(pushing upward), at depth 
is
The difference in pressure is

Equation 10–3b tells us how the pressure changes over a small change in depth 
within a fluid, ev
