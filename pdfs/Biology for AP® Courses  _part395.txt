a possible copying mechanism for the genetic
material.”
Eschenmoser and Lowenthal (Chemical Society Reviews,
21, 1992) asked why the 5-carbon sugar ribose is used in
DNA when the 6-carbon sugar glucose is so common in
biological systems. To answer the question, they
synthesized polymeric chains with this alternative form of
sugar. They discovered that the strength of the interaction
between pairs of nucleobases increased in the new
material. Paired strands of hexose-based polymers were
more stable.
The AP Biology Curriculum Framework (College Board,
2012) states, “The double-stranded structure of DNA
provides a simple and elegant solution for the transmission
of heritable information to the next generation; by using
each strand as a template, existing information can be
preserved and duplicated with high fidelity within the
replication process. However, the process of replication is
imperfect….”
B. Explain why the weaker interaction observed by
Eschenmoser and Lowenthal, and the acknow
