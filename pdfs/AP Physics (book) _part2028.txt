measured at 23.5°C. The wire is placed in a new environment
of unknown temperature where the measured current is
0.3818 A. What is the unknown temperature?
25. (III) For some applications, it is important that the value
of a resistance not change with temperature. For example,
suppose you made a 
resistor from a carbon resistor
and a Nichrome wire-wound resistor connected together so
the total resistance is the sum of their separate resistances.
What value should each of these resistors have (at 0°C) so
that the combination is temperature independent?
26. (III) A 10.0-m length of wire consists of 5.0 m of copper
followed by 5.0 m of aluminum, both of diameter 1.4 mm.
A voltage difference of 95 mV is placed across the composite
wire. (a) What is the total resistance (sum) of the two wires?
(b) What is the current through the wire? (c) What are the
voltages across the aluminum part and across the copper part?
