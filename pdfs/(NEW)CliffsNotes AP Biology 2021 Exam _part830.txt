iment that allows Artemia brine shrimp to move into water with different
concentrations of salt. The results of the experiment are shown in the histogram below.
17. According to the preceding histogram, most brine shrimp are found
in a habitat in which the salt concentration is
A. 0%
B. 5%
C. 15%
D. 20%
18. Artemia brine shrimp are rarely found in bodies of water with salt concentrations below 5%. This is probably
because
A. the brine shrimp prefer low levels of salt concentration B. the brine shrimp prefer high levels of salt concentration
C. predators of the brine shrimp are common in freshwater and water
with low salinity
 
D. the brine shrimp cannot survive in freshwater
19. The net primary productivity for a temperate forest was measured at 2,000 mg carbon fixed/L/day. The
respiratory rate of the community was determined to be 1,000 mg carbon fixed/L/day. The gross primary
productivity for this community is
A. 1,000 mg carbon fixed/L/day
B. 2,000 mg carbon fixed/L/day
C. 3,000 mg
