u will explore the following questions:
•
How does the fluid mosaic model describe the structure and components of the plasma cell membrane?
•
How do the molecular components of the membrane provide fluidity?
Connection for AP® Courses
Like an art mosaic, the plasma membrane consists of several different components. Phospholipids (which we studied in
previously) form a bilayer; the hydrophobic, fatty acid tails are in contact with each other and hydrophilic portions of the
phospholipids are oriented toward the aqueous internal and external environments. Several types of proteins with different
functions stud the membrane. Integral proteins often span the membrane and can transport materials into or out of the cells;
these embedded proteins can be hydrophilic or hydrophobic, depending on their placement within the membrane. Peripheral
proteins found on the exterior and interior surfaces of membranes can serve as enzymes, structural attachments for fibers of
the cytoskeleton, and part of
