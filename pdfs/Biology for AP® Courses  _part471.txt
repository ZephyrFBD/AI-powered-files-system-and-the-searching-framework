 Actin and myosin are plentiful
in muscle cells. When your actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, your muscles contract.
Microfilaments also provide some rigidity and shape to the cell. They can depolymerize (disassemble) and reform quickly,
thus enabling a cell to change its shape and move. White blood cells (your body’s infection-fighting cells) make good use
of this ability. They can move to the site of an infection and phagocytize the pathogen.
To see an example of a white blood cell in action, click here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/chasing_bcteria) and watch
a short time-lapse video of the cell capturing two bacteria. It engulfs one and then moves on to the other.
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infects and kills white blood cells. Over time, what affect does this have
on the body’s immune system?
a.
The body’s immune system would not be affected by this.
b.
The body’s immune system would not be able to fight off pathogens like bacteria with fewer white blood
c
