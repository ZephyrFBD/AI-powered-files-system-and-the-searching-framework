etion from
extracellular fluid of the cells in kidney tubules. Because it is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland and affects
the concentrations of minerals Na+ and K+, aldosterone is referred to as a mineralocorticoid, a corticosteroid that affects
ion and water balance. Aldosterone release is stimulated by a decrease in blood sodium levels, blood volume, or blood
pressure, or an increase in blood potassium levels. It also prevents the loss of Na+ from sweat, saliva, and gastric juice. The
reabsorption of Na+ also results in the osmotic reabsorption of water, which alters blood volume and blood pressure.
Aldosterone production can be stimulated by low blood pressure, which triggers a sequence of chemical release, as
illustrated in Figure 28.7. When blood pressure drops, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated. Cells
in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which regulates the functions of the nephrons of the kidney, detect this and release renin.
