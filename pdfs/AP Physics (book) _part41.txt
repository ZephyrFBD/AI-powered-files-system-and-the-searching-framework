The ultimate aim is to give students a thorough understanding of the basic
concepts of physics in all its aspects, from mechanics to modern physics. A second
objective is to show students how useful physics is in their own everyday lives and

Also, much effort has gone into techniques and approaches for solving
problems: worked-out Examples, Problem Solving sections (Sections 2–6, 3–6,
4–7, 4–8, 6–7, 6–9, 8–6, 9–2, 13–7, 14–4, and 16–6), and Problem S
