ysaccharides, but not peptidoglycans Plants: cellulose (beta-glucose polymer)
Fungi: chitin (modified polysaccharide differing from cellulose in that one of the hydroxyl groups is replaced by a
group containing nitrogen); (a nitrogen-containing polysaccharide)
Animals: no cell wall
 
b. Mode of reproduction
 
Bacteria: asexual by binary fission (also budding)
 
Archaea: asexual by binary fission (also budding and fragmentation)
 
Plants: sexual by meiosis; asexual by various vegetative mechanisms
 
Fungi: sexual by meiosis; asexual by asexual spores (also budding and fragmentation)
 
Animals: sexual by meiosis
 
c. Multicellularity, unicellularity, or the ability to form colonies
Bacteria: unicellular, individual cells that form filaments (cyanobacteria), and multiple species forming communities
such as biofilms
Archaea: unicellular
 
Plants: multicellular (some classification systems include unicellular and colonial green algae)
 
Fungi: unicellular and multicellular
 
Animals: multic
