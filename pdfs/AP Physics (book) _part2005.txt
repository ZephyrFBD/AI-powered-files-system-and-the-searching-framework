To develop 
superconductors for use as wires (such as for wires in
“superconducting electromagnets”—Section 20–7), many applications today
utilize a bismuth-strontium-calcium-copper oxide (BSCCO). A major challenge
is how to make a useable, bendable wire out of the BSCCO, which is very brittle.
(One solution is to embed tiny filaments of the 
superconductor in a metal
alloy, which is not resistanceless but has resistance much less than a conventional
copper cable.)

A neuron, before transmitting an electrical signal, is in the so-called “resting
state.” Like nearly all living cells, neurons have a net positive charge on the outer
surface of the cell membrane and a negative charge on the inner surface.
This difference in charge, or dipole layer, means that a potential difference 
exists across the cell membrane. When a neuron is not transmitting a signal, this
resting potential, normally stated as
is typically
