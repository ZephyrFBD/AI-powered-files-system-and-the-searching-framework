Other genes in the mitochondrial genome encode 40- to 80-nucleotide guide RNAs. One or more of
these molecules interacts by complementary base pairing with some of the nucleotides in the pre-mRNA
transcript. However, the guide RNA has more A nucleotides than the pre-mRNA has U nucleotides to bind
with. In these regions, the guide RNA loops out. The 3' ends of guide RNAs have a long poly-U tail, and
these U bases are inserted in regions of the pre-mRNA transcript at which the guide RNAs are looped. This
process is entirely mediated by RNA molecules. That is, guide RNAs—rather than proteins—serve as the
catalysts in RNA editing.
RNA editing is not just a phenomenon of trypanosomes. In the mitochondria of some plants, almost all
pre-mRNAs are edited. RNA editing has also been identified in mammals such as rats, rabbits, and even
humans. What could be the evolutionary reason for this add
