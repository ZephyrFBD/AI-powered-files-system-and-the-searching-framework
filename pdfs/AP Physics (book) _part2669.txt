ig. 24–26b. Because a diffraction grating spreads
out light into its component wavelengths, the resulting pattern is called a spectrum.
Diffraction grating: line positions. Determine the angular
positions of the first- and second-order lines (maxima) for light of wavelength
400 nm and 700 nm incident on a grating containing 10,000 slits per centimeter.
APPROACH First we find the distance d between grating slits: if the grating has
N slits in 1 m, then the distance between slits is
Then we use
Eq.24–4,
to get the angles for the two wavelengths for
and 2.
SOLUTION The grating contains 
which 
means 
the 
distance 
between 
slits 
is 
In first order 
the angles are
so
and
In second order,
so
But the second order does not exist for
because
cannot exceed 1. No higher orders will appear.
Spectra overlap. White light containing wavelengths from
400 nm to 750 nm strikes a grating containing 
Show that the blue

of the third-order spectrum overlaps the red at 700 nm of the
second order.
