 Inequalities 
1.9.1 Polynomial Inequalities 
An important consequence of the Intermediate Value Theorem is that the values of a 
polynomial function P do not change sign between successive zeros. 
In other words, the values of P between successive zeros are either all positive or all 
negative. 
Graphically, this means that between successive x-intercepts, the graph of P is entirely 
above or entirely below the x-axis. 
 
This property of polynomials allows us to solve polynomial inequalities like P(x) â‰¥ 0 by 
finding the zeros of the polynomial and using test points between successive zeros to 
determine the intervals that satisfy the inequality. 
 
P(x) > 0 or P(x) < 0 for x between successive zeros of P. 
 
1. Move All Terms to One Side. Rewrite the inequality so that all nonzero terms appear 
on one side of the inequality symbol. 
2. Factor the Polynomial. Factor the polynomial into irreducible factors, and find the real 
zeros of the polynomial. 
3. Find the Intervals. List the i
