nd you’re driven to yourself,wank wank wank, that’s all 
 
 we ever do in Limerick.There are new boys. I’m senior boy and the job 
 
 is easier because I’m fast and when Mr. McCaffrey is out in the van and 
 
 my work is done I read the English, Irish, American magazines and 
 
  
  
 papers. Day and night I dream of America. 
 
 Malachy goes to England to work in a rich Catholic boys’ boarding 
 
 school and he walks around cheerful and smiling as if he’s the equal of 
 
 any boy in the school and everyone knows when you work in an English 
 
 boarding school you’re supposed to hang your head and shuffle like 
 
 a proper Irish servant.They fire him for his ways and Malachy tells them 
 
 they can kiss his royal Irish arse and they say that’s the kind of foul language 
 
 and behavior you’d expect. He gets a job in the gas works in 
 
 Coventry shoveling coal into the furnaces like Uncle Pa Keating, shoveling 
 
 coal and waiting for the day he can go to America after me.
