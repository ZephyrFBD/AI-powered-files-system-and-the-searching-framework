14â€“7 Heat Transfer: Convection
Although liquids and gases are generally not very good conductors of heat, they can
transfer heat rapidly by convection. Convection is the process whereby heat flows
by the bulk movement of molecules from one place to another. Whereas conduction
involves molecules (and/or electrons) moving only over small distances and colliding,
convection involves the movement of large numbers of molecules over large distances.
A forced-air furnace, in which air is heated and then blown by a fan into a
room, is an example of forced convection. Natural convection occurs as well, and
one familiar example is that hot air rises. For instance, the air above a radiator
(or other type of heater) expands as it is heated (Chapter 13), and hence its density
decreases. Because its density is less than that of the surrounding cooler air, it rises
