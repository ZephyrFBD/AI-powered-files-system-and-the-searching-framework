native Hypothesis
An alternative hypothesis is that organic molecules were transported to Earth
on a meteorite or due to some other celestial event.
But how do we make the leap from simple organic molecules to more complex compounds and life as we know it?
Since no one was around to witness the process, no one knows for sure how (or when) it occurred. It is likely that
the original life-forms were simply molecules of RNA. This is called the RNA-world hypothesis. RNA can take
many shapes because it is not restricted to being a double helix. It is possible that RNA molecules capable of
replicating and thus passing along themselves (their genome) were the first life-forms. Complex organic compounds
(such as proteins) must have formed via dehydration synthesis. Simple cells then used organic molecules as their
source of food. Over time, simple cells evolved into complex cells.
Letâ€™s finish by defining a few more key terms. All organisms capture and store free energy for use in biological
