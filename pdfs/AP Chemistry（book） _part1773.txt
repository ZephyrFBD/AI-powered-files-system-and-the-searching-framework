r the following questions. (a) What are the 
approximate temperature and pressure of the critical point? 
(b) What are the approximate temperature and pressure of 
the triple point? (c) Is methane a solid, liquid, or gas at 1 
atm and 0 °C? (d) If solid methane at 1 atm is heated while 
the pressure is held constant, will it melt or sublime?  
(e) If methane at 1 atm and 0 °C is compressed until a phase 
change occurs, in which state is the methane when the 
compression is complete?
Sample Exercise 11.5 
Interpreting a Phase Diagram
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to identify key features of the phase diagram 
and to use it to deduce what phase changes occur when specific 
pressure and temperature changes take place.
Plan We must identify the triple and critical points on the dia-
gram and also identify which phase exists at specific temperatures 
and pressures.
