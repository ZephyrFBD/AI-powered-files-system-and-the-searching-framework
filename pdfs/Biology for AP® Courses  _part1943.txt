he approximate distance between
markers.
c.
In restriction mapping, the DNA fragments are
cut by using the restriction enzymes and then
stained fragments are viewed on gel.
d.
Cytogenetic mapping obtains information from
microscopic analysis of stained chromosomes. It
can estimate the exact base pair distance
between markers.
35. Describe three methods of gene sequencing.
a.
Chain termination method - automated
sequencers are used to generate sequences of
short fragments; Shotgun sequencing method -
incorporation of ddNTP during DNA
replication; Next-generation sequencing - cutting
DNA into random fragments, sequencing using
chain termination, and assembling overlapping
sequences
