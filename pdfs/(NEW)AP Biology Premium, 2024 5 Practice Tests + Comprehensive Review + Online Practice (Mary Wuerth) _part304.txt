Problems that Involve a Test Cross
An organism that displays the dominant phenotype may have either the homozygous dominant genotype or the
heterozygous genotype. One way to determine which genotype the organism has is by using a test cross. A test
cross is a cross between an organism with a dominant phenotype (whose genotype is unknown) and an organism
with the recessive phenotype. If the organism with the dominant phenotype is homozygous, all of the offspring of
the test cross will show the dominant phenotype. If the organism with the dominant phenotype is heterozygous,  of
the offspring of the test cross will show the dominant phenotype and  of the offspring of the test cross will show
the recessive phenotype, as shown in Figure 13.5.
