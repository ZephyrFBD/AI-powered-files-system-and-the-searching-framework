ron will only be expressed when glucose is absent and
lactose is present. Consequently, it follows that glucose must decrease
the expression of the lac operon, even when lactose is present. (C) is
thus correct. (A) is incorrect, because lactose induces the expression of
the lac operon when glucose is not present. (B) is incorrect because
the presence of lactose is insuﬀicient; glucose must also be absent for
the cell to produce β-galactosidase. (D) states the opposite of what is
true: the absence of glucose is necessary for β-galactosidase
production.

A phylogenetic tree shows the evolution of organisms. Here, the
horizontal axis of the diagram represents time. Thus, to argue that the
diagram shown here is correct, it must be assumed that enzyme X
evolved before protein Y. If the reverse were true, as (A) suggests, the
entire tree would need to be redrawn, because the branch points
would be in the wrong order. (A) is correct. (B) is incorrect because it
reflects the tree as drawn
