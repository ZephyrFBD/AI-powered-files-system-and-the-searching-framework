redicted to travel—
the same as the measured speed of light.
Light had been shown some 60 years before Maxwell’s work to behave like
a wave (we’ll discuss this in Chapter 24). But nobody knew what kind of wave it
was. What is it that is oscillating in a light wave? Maxwell, on the basis of the
calculated speed of EM waves, argued that light must be an electromagnetic wave.
This idea soon came to be generally accepted by scientists, but not fully until
after EM waves were experimentally detected. EM waves were first generated
and detected experimentally by Heinrich Hertz (1857–1894) in 1887, eight years
after Maxwell’s death. Hertz used a spark-gap apparatus in which charge was
made to rush back and forth for a short time, generating waves whose frequency
was about 
He detected them some distance away using a loop of wire in
which an emf was induced when a changing magnetic field passed through.

These waves were later shown to travel at the speed o
