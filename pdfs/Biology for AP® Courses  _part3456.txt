Intervertebral discs composed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebral bodies from the second cervical vertebra
to the sacrum. Each disc is part of a joint that allows for some movement of the spine and acts as a cushion to absorb shocks
from movements such as walking and running. Intervertebral discs also act as ligaments to bind vertebrae together. The
inner part of discs, the nucleus pulposus, hardens as people age and becomes less elastic. This loss of elasticity diminishes
its ability to absorb shocks.
The Thoracic Cage
The thoracic cage, also known as the ribcage, is the skeleton of the chest, and consists of the ribs, sternum, thoracic
vertebrae, and costal cartilages (Figure 29.9). The thoracic cage encloses and protects the organs of the thoracic cavity,
including the heart and lungs. It also provides support for the shoulder girdles and upper limbs, and serves as the attachment
point for the diaphragm, muscles of the back, chest, neck, and shoulders. Changes i
