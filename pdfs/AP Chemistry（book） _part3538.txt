repulsive interaction of the O¬ H bonds with 
the lone pairs of electrons on each O atom 
restricts the free rotation around the O¬O 
single bond.

adding two electrons, which results in a -2 oxidation state. Except for oxygen, the group 
6A elements are also commonly found in positive oxidation states up to +6, and they 
can have expanded valence shells. Thus, we have such compounds as SF6, SeF6, and TeF6 
with the central atom in the +6 oxidation state.
Table 22.5 summarizes some properties of the group 6A elements.
Occurrence and Production of S, Se, and Te
Sulfur, selenium, and tellurium can all be mined from the earth. Large underground 
deposits are the principal source of elemental sulfur (Figure 22.15). Sulfur also occurs 
widely as su
