 what factor would the power increase if four
D-cells in series (total 6.0 V) were used with the same bulb?
(Neglect heating effects of the filament.) Why shouldn’t you
try this?

20. (II) A length of wire is cut in half and the two lengths are
wrapped together side by side to make a thicker wire. How
does the resistance of this new combination compare to the
resistance of the original wire?
21. (II) How much would you have to raise the temperature of
a copper wire (originally at 20°C) to increase its resistance
by 12%?
22. (II) Determine at what temperature aluminum will have
the same resistivity as tungsten does at 20°C.
23. (II) A 100-W lightbulb has a resistance of about 
when
cold (20°C) and 
when on (hot). Estimate the tem-
perature of the filament when hot assuming an average
temperature coefficient of resistivity 
24. (III) A length of aluminum wire is connected to a precision
10.00-V power supply, and a current of 0.4212 A is precisel
