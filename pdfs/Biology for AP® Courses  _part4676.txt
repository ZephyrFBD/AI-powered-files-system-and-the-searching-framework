Human activity has altered the oyster population and locations, greatly disrupting the ecosystem.
The restoration of the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay has been ongoing for several years with
mixed success. Not only do many people find oysters good to eat, but they also clean up the bay. Oysters
are filter feeders, and as they eat, they clean the water around them. In the 1700s, it was estimated that
it took only a few days for the oyster population to filter the entire volume of the bay. Today, with changed
water conditions, it is estimated that the present population would take nearly a year to do the same job.
Restoration efforts have been ongoing for several years by non-profit organizations, such as the
Chesapeake Bay Foundation. The restoration goal is to find a way to increase population density so the
oysters can reproduce more efficiently. Many disease-resistant varieties (developed at the Virginia Institute
