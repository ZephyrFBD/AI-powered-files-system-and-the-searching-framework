17. (II) Three children are trying to balance on a seesaw, which
includes a fulcrum rock acting as a pivot at the center, and
a very light board 3.2 m long (Fig. 9–57). Two playmates
are already on either end. Boy A has a mass of 45 kg, and
boy B a mass of 35 kg. Where should girl C, whose mass is
25 kg, place herself so as to balance the seesaw?
18. (II) A shop sign weighing 215 N hangs from the end of a uni-
form 155-N beam as shown in Fig. 9–58. Find the tension in
the supporting wire (at 35.0°), and the horizontal
and vertical forces exerted by the hinge on t
