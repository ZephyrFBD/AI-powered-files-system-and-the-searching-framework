y components and perform the vector addition.
SOLUTION The magnitudes of 
and 
are (ignoring signs of the charges
since we know the directions)
(We keep 3 significant figures until the end, and then keep 2 because only 2 are
given.) We resolve 
into its components along the x and y axes, as shown in
Fig. 16–20a:
The force 
has only a y component. So the net force 
on 
has components
The magnitude of the net force is
and it acts at an angle (see Fig. 16–20b) given by
so
NOTE Because 
and 
are not along the same line, the magnitude of 
is
not equal to the sum (or difference as in Example 16–3) of the separate magni-
tudes. That is,
is not equal to 
nor does it equal 
Instead
we had to do vector addition.
