 of Darwin’s theory, but not

The question posed asks for the chi-square value for a null hypothesis that concerns only
the feathered-tail and straight-tail alleles, so ignore the role that the long and short
alleles play. Out of 96 total oﬀspring, 30 + 10 = 40 had straight tails and 42 + 14 = 56 had
feathered tails. Using F to represent the feathered-tail allele and f to represent the
straight-tail allele, a cross between an Ff female and an ﬀ male would be expected to
produce half feathered tails (Ff) and half straight tails (ﬀ), or 48 of each. This gives a chi-
square calculation as follows:

Answers and Explanations
χ2 = 2.666
Rounding to the nearest hundredth gives a chi-square value of 2.67. Therefore, (C) is
correct.
