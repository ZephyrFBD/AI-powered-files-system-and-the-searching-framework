is lower in energy than the p
2p MOs, and the antibo-
nding s*
2p MO is higher in energy than the p*
2p MOs.
t Both the p
2p and p*
2p MOs are doubly degenerate; that is, there are two degenerate 
MOs of each type.
Before we can add electrons to Figure 9.41, we must consider one more effect. We 
have constructed the diagram assuming no interaction between the 2s orbital on one 
atom and the 2p orbitals on the other. In fact, such interactions can and do take place. 
Figure 9.42 shows the overlap of a 2s orbital on one of the atoms with a 2p orbital on the 
other. These interactions increase the energy difference between the s
2s and s
2p MOs, 
with the s
2s energy decreasing and the s
2p energy increasing (Figure 9.42). These 2sâ€“2p 
interactions can be strong enough that the energetic ordering of the MOs can be altered: 
For B2, C2, and N2, the s
2p MO is above the p
2p MOs in energy. For O2, F2, and Ne2, the s
2p 
MO is below the p
2p MOs.
Given the energy ordering of the molecular o
