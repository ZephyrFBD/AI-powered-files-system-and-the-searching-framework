A) View 1 because RBC membranes are freely permeable to water 
(B) View 2 because the RBCs use energy to allow sodium entry and to pump water out 
(C) View 2 because the rate of water movement into the RBCs equals the rate of water movement out of the 
cells 
(D) View 3 because the sodium-potassium pumps in the RBC membranes use energy to keep the sodium out but 
allow water to freely flow into the cells

24. Which of the following statements most directly 
supports the claim that different species of 
organisms use different metabolic strategies to 
meet their energy requirements for growth, 
reproduction, and homeostasis? 
(A) During cold periods pond-dwelling animals 
can increase the number of unsaturated fatty 
acids in their cell membranes while some 
plants make antifreeze proteins to prevent 
ice crystal formation in tissues. 
(B) Bacteria lack introns while many eukaryotic 
genes contain many of these intervening 
sequences. 
(C)
