ius of the orbit gets 
larger as n increases. Thus, the first allowed orbit (the one closest to the nucleus) has 
n = 1, the next allowed orbit (the one second closest to the nucleus) has n = 2, and so 
forth. The electron in the hydrogen atom can be in any allowed orbit, and Equation 6.5 
tells us the energy the electron has in each allowed orbit.
Note that the energies of the electron given by Equation 6.5 are negative 
for all values of n. The lower (more negative) the energy is, the more stable the atom 
is. The energy is lowest (most negative) for n = 1. As n gets larger, the energy becomes 
less negative and therefore increases. We can liken the situation to a ladder in which 
the rungs are numbered from the bottom. The higher one climbs (the greater the value 
of n), the higher the energy. The lowest-energy state (n = 1, analogous to the bottom 
rung) is called the ground state of the atom. When the electron is in a higher-energy 
state (n = 2 or higher), the atom is said to be
