A house thermostat is normally set to 22°C, but at night it
is turned down to 16°C for 9.0 h. Estimate how much more
heat would be needed (state as a percentage of daily usage)
if the thermostat were not turned down at night. Assume that
the outside temperature averages 0°C for the 9.0 h at night
and 8°C for the remainder of the day, and that the heat loss
from the house is proportional to the temperature difference
inside and out. To obtain an estimate from the data, you must
make other simplifying assumptions; state what these are.

1. Create graphs similar to Fig.14–5, but for lead and ethyl alco-
hol. Compare and contrast them with each other and with the
graph for water. Are there any temperature ranges for which
all three substances are liquids? All vapors? All solids?
For convenience, use the specific heats given in Table 14–1
for all states of lead and ethyl alcohol.
2. (a) Using the solar constant, estimate the rate at which
