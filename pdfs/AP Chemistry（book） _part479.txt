(a)  
If you start with 150 g of Fe2O3 as the limiting reactant, 
what is the theoretical yield of Fe?
(b) If your actual yield is 87.9 g, what is the percent yield?
One of the most important skills you can learn in school is how to 
think like a scientist. Questions such as: “What experiment might 
test this hypothesis?”, “How do I interpret these data?”, and “Do 
these data support the hypothesis?” are asked every day by chemists 
and other scientists as they go about their work.
We want you to become a good critical thinker as well as an 
 
active, logical, and curious learner. For this purpose, starting in this 
chapter, we include at the end of each chapter a special exercise 
called “Design an Experiment.” Here is an example:
Is milk a pure liquid or a mixture of chemical components in water? 
Design an experiment to distinguish between these two possibilities.
You might already know the answer—milk is indeed a mixture 
of components in water—but the goal is to think of how to
