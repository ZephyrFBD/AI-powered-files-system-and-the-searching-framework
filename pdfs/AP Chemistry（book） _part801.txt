n the reaction could then be stored and 
allowed to react later, with the heat released being put to useful work.
One of the biggest challenges facing us in the twenty-first century is 
production of abundant sources of energy, both food and fuels. At 
the end of 2015, the global population was estimated to be 7.4 bil-
lion people, and growing at a rate of about 750 million per decade. A 
growing world population puts greater demands on the global food 
supply, especially in Asia and Africa, which together make up more 
than 75% of the world population.
A growing population also increases demands on the produc-
tion of fuels for transportation, industry, electricity, heating, and 
cooling. As populous countries such as China and India have mod-
ernized, their per capita consumption of energy has increased sig-
nificantly. In China, for instance, per capita energy consumption 
roughly doubled between 1990 and 2010, and in 2010 China passed 
the United States as the worldâ€™s largest user
