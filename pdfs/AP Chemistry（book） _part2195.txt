ture 
gets more intense as I2 forms. Thus, visible light of appropriate wave-
length can be used to monitor the reaction (Figure 14.4).
Figure 14.5 shows the components of a spectrometer. The spec-
trometer measures the amount of light absorbed by the sample by 
comparing the intensity of the light emitted from the light source with 
the intensity of the light transmitted through the sample, for various 
wavelengths. As the concentration of I2 increases and its color becomes 
more intense, the amount of light absorbed by the reaction 
mixture increases, as Figure 14.4 shows, causing less light to 
reach the detector.
How can we relate the amount of light detected by the spec-
trometer to the concentration of a species? A relationship called 
Beer’s law gives us a direct route to the information we seek. Beer’s 
law connects the amount of light absorbed to the concentration 
of the absorbing substance:
            
A = ebc

In this equation, A is the measured absorbance, e is the
