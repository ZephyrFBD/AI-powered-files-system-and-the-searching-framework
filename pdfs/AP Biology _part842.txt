s allocate more of
their biomass production to reproduction and seeds than do slower-
growing perennials. The producers are consumed or decomposed, and their
stored chemical energy powers the other trophic levels of the biotic
community. Understanding energy dynamics in a biotic community will

help you understand ecological interactions.
Objective
This lab has two parts. First, you will estimate the net primary productivity
(NPP) of Wisconsin Fast Plants (the producers) growing under lights.
Then, you will calculate the flow of energy from the Wisconsin Fast Plants
to cabbage white butterfly larvae (the consumers that eat the plants).
Figure 19.22 models how energy flows through a plant.

ESTIMATING NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY (NPP)
OF FAST PLANTS
Primary productivity is a rate. It is the energy captured by photosynthetic
organisms in a given area per unit of time.
When light energy is converted to c
