 represent a substantial caloric 
intake. The difference is that the starch is hydrolyzed to glucose, which is eventually 
oxidized with the release of energy. However, enzymes in the body do not readily 
hydrolyze cellulose, so it passes through the digestive system relatively unchanged. 
Many bacteria contain enzymes, called cellulases, that hydrolyze cellulose. These bac-
teria are present in the digestive systems of grazing animals, such as cattle, that use 
cellulose for food.

24.9 âˆ£ Lipids
Lipids are a diverse class of nonpolar biological molecules used by organisms for long-
term energy storage (fats, oils) and as elements of biological structures (phospholipids, 
cell membranes, waxes).
Fats
Fats are lipids derived from glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol is an alcohol with three 
OH groups. Fatty acids are carboxylic acids (RCOOH) in which R is a hydrocarbon 
chain, us
