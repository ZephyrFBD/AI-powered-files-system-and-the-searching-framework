n formation, and it takes place in
the nucleus. Translation of RNA to protein occurs in the cytoplasm.
Gene expression is regulated
primarily at the transcriptional
level
Gene expression is regulated at many levels (epigenetic, transcriptional,
nuclear shuttling, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational)

Prokaryotic cells can only regulate gene expression by controlling the amount of transcription. As eukaryotic
cells evolved, the complexity of the control of gene expression increased. For example, with the evolution
of eukaryotic cells came compartmentalization of important cellular components and cellular processes. A
nuclear region that contains the DNA was formed. Transcription and translation were physically separated
into two different cellular compartments. It therefore became possible to control gene expression by
regulating transcriptio
