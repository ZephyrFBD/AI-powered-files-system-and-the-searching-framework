A short time later, Fig. 26–5b, light from

reach

(we assumed this). Since 
knows (or measures) the distances 
and 
as equal,
knows the two events are simultaneous in the 
reference frame.

CHAPTER 26
The Special Theory of Relativity
FIGURE 26–5 Thought experiment on simultaneity. In both
(a) and (b) we are in the reference frame of observer 
who sees the reference frame of 
moving to the right.
In (a), one lightning bolt strikes the two reference frames at
and 
and a second lightning bolt strikes at 
and 
(b) A moment later, the light (shown in blue) from the two
events reaches 
at the same time. So according to 
observer 
the two bolts of lightning struck simultaneously.
But in 
reference frame, the light from 
has already
reached 
whereas the light from 
has not yet reached 
So in 
reference frame, the event at 
must have
preceded the
