Introduction
The definition of gene has progressed from being an abstract unit of heredity in Mendel’s time to our current concept
of a tangible molecular entity capable of replication, expression, and mutation (Figure 15.1). Currently, we can perform
tests for many genetic diseases, but these tests create ethical and legal issues. For example, would you want to be tested
for a debilitating genetic disease if there was the possibility insurance companies could use that information to deny
you coverage? Fortunately, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 protects American citizens from
discrimination from both insurance companies and employers base
