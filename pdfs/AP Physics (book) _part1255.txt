67. A simple pendulum oscillates with frequency f. What is its
frequency if the entire pendulum accelerates at 0.35 g
(a) upward, and (b) downward?
68. A 0.650-kg mass oscillates according to the equation
where x is in meters and is in seconds.
Determine (a) the amplitude, (b) the frequency, (c) the
period, (d) the total energy, and (e) the kinetic energy and
potential energy when x is 15 cm.
69. An oxygen atom at a particular site within a DNA mole-
cule can be made to execute simple harmonic motion
when illuminated by infrared light. The oxygen atom is
bound with a spring-like chemical bond to a phosphorus
atom, which is rigidly attached to the DNA backbone.
The oscillation of the oxygen atom occurs with frequency
If the oxygen atom at this site is chem-
ically replaced with a sulfur atom, the spr
