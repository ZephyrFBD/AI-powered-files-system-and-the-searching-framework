 the number of microstates that give the same macrostate
corresponds to the relative probability of that macrostate occurring. The macrostate
of two heads and two tails is the most probable one in our case of tossing four coins;
out of the total of 16 possible microstates, six correspond to two heads and two tails,
so the probability of throwing two heads and two tails is 6 out of 16, or 38%. The
probability of throwing one head and three tails is 4 out of 16, or 25%. The prob-
ability of four heads is only 1 in 16, or 6%. If you threw the coins 16 times, you
might not find that two heads and two tails appear exactly 6 times, or four tails
exactly once. These are only probabilities or averages. But if you made 1600 throws,
very nearly 38% of them would be two heads and two tails. The greater the number
of tries, the closer the percentages are to the calculated probabilities.
