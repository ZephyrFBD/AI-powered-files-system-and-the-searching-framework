a or chloroplast), so choice (C) is incorrect.
6. (D) A heterozygous, red-eyed female fly would have the genotype XRXr, and a white-eyed male fly would have
the Xr Y genotype. The Punnett square for this cross is shown in the following figure.
The most likely result would be 50% of both sexes would have red eyes and 50% of both sexes would have
white eyes.
7. (A) The figure that follows shows the Punnett square for the cross between a heterozygous male and a female
with the recessive trait. So  of the offspring would be males with the dominant phenotype,  would be males
with the recessive phenotype,  would be females with the dominant phenotype, and  would be females with
the recessive phenotype.
8. (B) As shown in the figure,  of the offspring would be black female cats,  would be calico female cats, 
would be black male cats, and  would be orange male cats.
9. (D) Both females and males are affected, but only females appear to be able to pass the trait on to the next
generationâ€”these
