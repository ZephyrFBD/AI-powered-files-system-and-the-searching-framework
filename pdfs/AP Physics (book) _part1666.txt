Thus we see that as the number of coins increases, the probability of obtaining
the most orderly arrangement (all heads or all tails) becomes extremely unlikely.
The least orderly arrangement (half heads, half tails) is the most probable, and the
probability of being within, say, 5% of the most probable arrangement greatly
increases as the number of coins increases. These same ideas can be applied to the
molecules of a system. For example, the most probable state of a gas (say, the 
air in a room) is one in which the molecules take up the whole space and move
about randomly; this corresponds to the Maxwellian distribution, Fig. 15–19a
(and see Section 13–10). On the other hand, the very orderly arrangement of 
all the molecules located in one corner of the room and all moving with the same
velocity (Fig. 15–19b) is extremely unlikely.
From these examples, we can see that probability is directly related to disorder
and hence to entropy. That is, the most probable state is the one
