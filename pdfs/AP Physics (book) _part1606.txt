†If a gas expands or is compressed quickly, there is turbulence and different parts of the gas in its

If the gas is initially in a state represented by point A in Fig. 15–2, and an amount
of heat Q is added to the system, the pressure and volume will change and 
the state of the system will be represented by another point, B, on the diagram.
If the temperature is to remain constant, the gas will expand and do an amount 
of work W on the environment (it exerts a force on the piston in Fig. 15–1
and moves it through a distance). The temperature and mass are kept constant
so, from Eq. 14–1, the internal energy does not change:
Hence, by the first law of thermodynamics, Eq. 15–1,
so
the work done by the gas in an isothermal pr
