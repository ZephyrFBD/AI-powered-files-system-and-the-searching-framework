the expression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual displays an intermediate phenotype. The allele for red
flowers is incompletely dominant over the allele for white flowers. However, the results of a heterozygote self-cross can still
be predicted, just as with Mendelian dominant and recessive crosses. In this case, the genotypic ratio would be 1 CRCR:2
CRCW:1 CWCW, and the phenotypic ratio would be 1:2:1 for red:pink:white.

Codominance
A variation on incomplete dominance is codominance, in which both alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously
expressed in the heterozygote. An example of codominance is the MN blood groups of humans. The M and N alleles
are expressed in the form of an M or N antigen present on the surface of red blood cells. Homozygotes (LMLM and
LNLN) express either the M or the N allele, and heterozy
