tal lobe are involved in speech and also reading.
Two of the parietal lobe’s main functions are processing somatosensation—touch sensations like pressure, pain, heat,
cold—and processing proprioception—the sense of how parts of the body are oriented in space. The parietal lobe contains
a somatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex.
The occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain. It is primarily involved in vision—seeing, recognizing, and identifying
the visual world.
The temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting
sounds. It also contains the hippocampus (Greek for “seahorse”)—a structure that processes memory formation. The
hippocampus is illustrated in Figure 26.24. The role of the hippocampus in memory was partially determined by studying
one famous epileptic patient, HM, who had both sides of his hippocampus removed in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. His
seizures went away, but he cou
