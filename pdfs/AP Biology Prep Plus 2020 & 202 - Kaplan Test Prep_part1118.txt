51. A critic of the researchers claims that the diﬀerences in UV reflectance
indicate that these species aren’t closely related. Which of the following
would best support the claim of an earlier evolutionary divergence
between some species of anoles?
In regions of habitat that overlap between species D and A, fertile
hybrid oﬀspring have been found.
(A)
A large mountain range separates the five species of anoles from
each other.
(B)
The dewlaps of species D and E develop from the skin on the face,
whereas the dewlaps of species A, B, and C develop from the skin on
the neck.
(C)
The diﬀerent species of anoles frequently hunt each other and fight
over territory.
(D)
52. Aȇer genomic sequencing, the researchers found that species B and D
share more of the same random mutations than any of the other species.
According to the molecular clock hypothesis, what does the data most
likely suggest?
Species D must have diverged from species B
