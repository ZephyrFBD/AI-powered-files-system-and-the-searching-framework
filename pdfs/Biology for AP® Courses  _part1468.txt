 and it was discovered that the
E and W genes were not linked. Which is the correct
genotype of the F2 offspring if the genes were linked and
if the genes were not linked?
a.
Linked: 50% EeWw and 50% eeww; not
linked: 25% EeWw, 25% , Eeww 25% eeWw,
and 25% eeww
b.
Linked: 25% Eeww, 50% eeWw; not linked:
parental genotypes EeWw and eeww.
c.
Linked genotypes (EeWw and eeww) and
recombinant genotypes (Eeww and eeWw) in
the F2 generation are nearly the same
irrespective of their linkage.
d.
Linked: mostly with parental genotypes, Eeww
and eeWw; unlinked: 25% EeWw and eeww
with 75% Eeww and eeWw.

A cross was made with true-breeding AABB flies and
true-breeding aabb flies. The resulting F1 generation was
then crossed with true-breeding aabb flies. Based on the
linkage map, which of the following F2 generation
genotype ratios is most likely to be observed?
a.
Number Observed: AaBb (46), Aabb (4), aaBb
(4), Aabb (46)
b.
Number Observed: AaBb (4), Aabb (46), aaBb
(46), Aabb (4)
c.
Number Ob
