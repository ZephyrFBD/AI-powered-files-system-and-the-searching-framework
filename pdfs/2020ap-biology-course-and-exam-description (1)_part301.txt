Individual and/or set-based  
multiple-choice questions will 
assess students’ ability to develop 
and justify scientific arguments 
using evidence.
Students will need to make scientific 
claims, support claims with evidence, 
and provide reasoning to justify 
claims. Additionally, students 
will need to explain relationships 
between experimental results and 
larger biological concepts, processes, 
or theories. Finally, students will 
need to predict the causes or 
effects of a change in, or disruption 
to, one or more components in a 
biological system.
Free-response questions 1, 2, 
3, 4, and 6 include one, two, or 
occasionally three points per question 
that assess Science Practice 6.
