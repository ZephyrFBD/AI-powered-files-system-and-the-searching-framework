 chromosome; therefore, the process of cell
division is simplified. Karyokinesis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus and thus no need to direct one copy of the
multiple chromosomes into each daughter cell. This type of cell division is called binary (prokaryotic) fission.
Binary Fission
Due to the relative simplicity of the prokaryotes, the cell division process, called binary fission, is a less complicated and
much more rapid process than cell division in eukaryotes. The single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed
in a nucleus, but instead occupies a specific location, the nucleoid, within the cell (Figure 10.2). Although the DNA of the
nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size, there are no histone proteins and
thus no nucleosomes in prokaryotes. The packing proteins of bacteria are, however, related to the cohesin and condensin
proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes.
