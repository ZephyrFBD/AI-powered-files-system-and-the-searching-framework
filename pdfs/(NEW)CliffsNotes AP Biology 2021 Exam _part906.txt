is permeable to IKI and glucose, but not to starch. D. The bag is permeable to IKI, but not to starch and
glucose.
Questions 3-7 refer to the following figure, which shows a mitogen-acell division.
 
3. The figure shows two signaling molecules binding to a transmembrane receptor protein (shown at I). What do
these signaling molecules do?
A. They provide energy to the receptor molecules that will be used to activate relay proteins and cascade proteins.
B. They disable a signal transduction pathway by causing two adjacent receptor proteins to lock together.
C. They activate the receptor proteins, causing them to initiate a signal transduction pathway.
D. They activate the receptor proteins, causing them to open a gated ion channel, allowing the passage of specific
molecules across the membrane.
4. In the figure, the activated receptor proteins allow the binding of a relay protein (shown at II). In turn, the relay
protein triggers the activation of the G protein called Ras. How is the Ras
