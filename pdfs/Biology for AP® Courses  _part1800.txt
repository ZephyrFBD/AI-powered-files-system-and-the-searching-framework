tional control can be
detected in cancer. While these changes donâ€™t occur simultaneously in one cancer, changes at each of these levels can
be detected when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals. Therefore, changes in histone acetylation
(epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing), activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation, increased RNA
stability, increased translational control, and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells.
Scientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification
might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell.
Tumor Suppressor Genes, Oncogenes, and Cancer
In normal cells, some genes function to prevent excess, inappropriate cell growth. These are tumor suppressor genes, which
are active in normal cells to prevent uncontrolled cell growth. There are many tumor suppressor genes in cells. The most
studied tumor suppressor gene i
