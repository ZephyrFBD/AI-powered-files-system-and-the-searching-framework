alloys
An alloy is a material that contains more than one element and has the characteristic 
properties of a metal. The alloying of metals is of great importance because it is one of the 
primary ways of modifying the properties of pure metallic elements. Nearly all the com-
mon uses of iron, for example, involve alloy compositions (for example, stainless steel). 
Bronze is formed by alloying copper and tin, while brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. 
Pure gold is too soft
