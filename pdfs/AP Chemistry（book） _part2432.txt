+ 3 H21g2 ∆ 2 NH31g2
Adding H2 causes the system to shift so as to reduce the increased concentration of H2 
(Figure 15.11). This change can occur only if the reaction consumes H2 and simultane-
ously consumes N2 to form more NH3. Adding N2 to the equilibrium mixture likewise 
causes the reaction to shift toward forming more NH3. Removing NH3 also causes a shift 
toward producing more NH3, whereas adding NH3 to the system at equilibrium causes the 
reaction to shift in the direction that reduces the increased NH3 concentration: Some of 
the added ammonia decomposes to form N2 and H2. All of these “shifts” are entirely con-
sistent with predictions that we would make by comparing the reaction quotient Q with 
the equilibrium constant K.
In the Haber reaction, therefore, removing NH3 from an equilibrium mixture of 
N2, H2, and NH3 causes the reaction to shift right to form more NH3. If the NH3 can be 
removed continuously as it is produced, the yield can be increased dramatically. In the
