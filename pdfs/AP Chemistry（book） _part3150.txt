es. The standard free energy of each 
substance is given in Appendix C. (a) What is the equi-
librium constant for the reaction at 298 K? (b) In princi-
ple, is this reaction a feasible method of removing SO2?  
(c) If P
SO2 = P
H2S and the vapor pressure of water is 25 torr, 
calculate the equilibrium SO2 pressure in the system at 
298 K. (d) Would you expect the process to be more or 
less effective at higher temperatures?
 19.112  When most elastomeric polymers (e.g., a rubber band) 
are stretched, the molecules become more ordered, as 
illustrated here:

Suppose you stretch a rubber band. (a) Do you expect the 
entropy of the system to increase or decrease? (b) If the 
rubber band were stretched isothermally, would heat need 
to be absorbed or emitted to maintain constant tempera-
ture? (c) Try this experiment: Stretch a rubber band and 
wait a moment. Then place the stretched rubber band on 
your upper lip, and let it return suddenly to its unstretched
