cid sequence because multiple
codons produce the same amino acid. (IST-4)
(D) In this case, UAC codes for Tyr, while UAA, the mutated
version, codes for a Stop codon. The cell stops reading the mRNA
strand, and no polypeptide will be produced. (IST-4)
(A) DNA (triplet code) makes RNA (codon), which makes protein
(anticodon). If the triplet in DNA is AAA, then the codon on mRNA
is UUU, and the anticodon on tRNA is AAA. (IST-1)
(C) Only 1.0% of DNA codes for proteins. Most of the remaining
DNA, about 75% of it, are regulatory sequences that are involved
with gene regulation. (IST-2)
(D) Replication of DNA occurs during the S (synthesis) phase of
interphase. (IST-1)
(A) Prions are infectious proteins. They can turn normal proteins into
misfolded ones. (IST-1)
(A) Lactose, or allolactose (an isomer of lactose), is the inducer that
facilitates transcription by first binding to and deactivating the
repressor. With the repressor deactivated, RNA polymerase can bind
to the promoter, and transc
