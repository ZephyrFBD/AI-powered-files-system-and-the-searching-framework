process by which most of the water and solutes
(glucose, amino acids, and vitamins) that initially entered the tubule during
filtration are transported back into the peritubular capillaries and, thus,
back to the body. This process begins in the proximal convoluted tubule
and continues in the loop of Henle and collecting tubule. The main
function of the loop of Henle is to move salts from the filtrate and

accumulate them in the medulla surrounding the loop of Henle and the
collecting tubule. In this way, the loop of Henle acts as a countercurrent
exchange mechanism (see Chapter 3, “The Cell”), maintaining a steep
salt gradient surrounding the loop. This gradient ensures that water
molecules will continue to flow out of the collecting tubule of the nephron,
thus creating hypertonic urine and conserving water. The longer the loop
of Henle, the greater is the reabsorption of water.
Excretion is the removal of metabolic wastes, for example, nitr
