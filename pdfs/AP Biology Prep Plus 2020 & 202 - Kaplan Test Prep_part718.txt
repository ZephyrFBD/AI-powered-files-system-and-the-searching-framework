rchaefructus liaoningensis is a fossil species of angiosperm
(flowering plant) found in rock strata that is 125 to 130 million
years old. Molecular data suggest that the divergence of
angiosperms from earlier plants occurred 215 million years ago.
Which of the following is a reasonable scientific approach to
resolve this discrepancy?
Manipulate the molecular data to make it match the fossil
record.
(A)
Search for fossil angiosperms in rocks older than 215 million
years old.
(B)
Search for fossil angiosperms in rock strata between 130 and
215 million years old.
(C)
Search for fossil angiosperms in rock strata younger than 125
million years old.
(D)
