tom acts like a simple
harmonic oscillator with a mass equal to the mass of an
oxygen atom. It is observed that this oscillation occurs 
at a frequency

Problem 78.
79. A bug on the surface of a pond is observed to move up and
down a total vertical distance of 0.12 m, lowest to highest
point, as a wave passes. (a) What is the amplitude of the
wave? (b) If the amplitude increases to 0.16 m, by what
factor does the bug’s maximum kinetic energy change?
80. An earthquake-produced surface wave can be approximated
by a sinusoidal transverse wave. Assuming a frequency of
0.60 Hz (typical of earthquakes, which actually include a
mixture of frequencies), what amplitude is needed so that
objects begin to leave contact with the ground? [Hint: Set
the acceleration

81. Two strings on a musical instrument are tuned to play at
392 Hz (G) and 494 Hz (B). (a) What are the frequencies of
the first two overtones for each
