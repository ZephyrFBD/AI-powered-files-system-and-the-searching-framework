ude of the dipole moment increases. Ion–dipole forces are especially important 
for solutions of ionic substances in polar liquids, such as a solution of NaCl in water.

Comparing Intermolecular Forces
We can identify the intermolecular forces operative in a substance by consider-
ing its composition and structure. Dispersion forces are found in all substances. The 
strength of these attractive forces increases with increasing molecular weight and 
depends on molecular shapes. With polar molecules dipole–dipole interactions are 
also operative, but these interactions often make a smaller contribution to the total 
intermolecular attraction than do dispersion forces. For example, in liquid HCl, dis-
persion forces are estimated to account for more than 80% of the total attraction 
between molecules, while dipole–dipole attractions account for the rest. Hydrogen 
bonds, when present, make an important contribution to the total intermolecular 
interaction.
In general, the
