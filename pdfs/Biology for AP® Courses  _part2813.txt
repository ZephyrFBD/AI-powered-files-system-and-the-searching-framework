 developed further specialization of cells and tissues and efficiently control body functions. Moreover, surface area-to-
volume ratio applies to other areas of animal development, such as the relationship between muscle mass and cross-sectional
surface area in supporting skeletons, and in the relationship between muscle mass and the generation of dissipation of heat.

Zebrafish have bilateral symmetry. What does that mean?
a.
Bilaterally symmetric means that a plane cut from the front to back of the organism produces distinct left and
right sides that are mirror images of each other.
b.
Bilaterally symmetric means that a plane cut from the top to the bottom of the organism produces distinct
left and rig
