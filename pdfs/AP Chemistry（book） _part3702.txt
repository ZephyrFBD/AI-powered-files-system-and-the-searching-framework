d geometric 
isomerism. The isomer with like ligands in adjacent positions is the cis isomer, 
and the isomer with like ligands across from one another is the trans isomer.
Geometric isomers generally have different physical properties and may also 
have markedly different chemical reactivities. For example, cis@3Pt(NH3)2Cl24, 
also called cisplatin, is effective in the treatment of testicular, ovarian, and certain 
other cancers, whereas the trans isomer is ineffective. This is because cisplatin 
forms a chelate with two nitrogens of DNA, displacing the chloride ligands. The 
chloride ligands of the trans isomer are too far apart to form the N-Pt-N chelate 
with the nitrogen donors in DNA.
Geometric isomerism is also possible in octahedral complexes when two or 
more different ligands are present, as in the cis and trans tetraamminedichloroco-
balt(III) ion in Figure 23.8. Because all four corners of a tetrahedron are adjacent to 
one another, cisâ€“trans isomerism is not observed in te
