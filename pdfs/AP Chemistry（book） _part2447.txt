The Effect of Catalysts
What happens if we add a catalyst to a chemical system that is at equilibrium? As 
shown in Figure 15.16, a catalyst lowers the activation barrier between reactants and 
products. The activation energies for both the forward and reverse reactions are low-
ered. The catalyst thereby increases the rates of both forward and reverse reactions. 
Since K is the ratio of the forward and reverse rate constants for a reaction, you can 
predict, correctly, that the presence of a cataly
