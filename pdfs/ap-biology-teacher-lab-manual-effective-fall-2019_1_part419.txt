piration. How can you get a value with those units from your graph? 
3. What additional questions can you explore about cellular respiration using the same 
respirometers from this experiment? 
4. In the next part of this investigation, you will design and conduct your own 
experiments to answer questions that you raised in Procedures. Do you have any 
suggestions for improving the design of microrespirometers or procedure for 
measuring oxygen consumption/cellular respiration? 
Option 2: Using Gas Pressure Sensors with Computer  
Interface to Measure the Rate of Cellular Respiration  
Gas pressure sensors can be used to measure the rate of cellular respiration by 
measuring the amount of O2 consumed, the amount of CO2 produced, or both 
simultaneously. Your teacher will provide written instructions or perhaps ask you to 
download information from the manufacturerâ€™s website or another online resource. If 
you are unfamiliar with the use of probes with a computer interface, you will nee
