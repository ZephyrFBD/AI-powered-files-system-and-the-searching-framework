can be conducted during the study of concepts pertaining to 
interactions (big idea 4) or to cellular processes (big idea 2), specifically the capture, use, 
and storage of free energy. In addition, some of the questions are likely to connect to big 
idea 1 if students explore the evolution of observed behaviors. As always, it is important 
to make connections between big ideas and enduring understandings, regardless 
of where in the curriculum the lab is taught. The concepts align with the enduring 
understandings and learning objectives from the AP Biology Curriculum Framework, as 
indicated below. 
 
■Enduring Understandings
• ENE-3: Timing and coordination of biological mechanisms involved in growth, 
reproduction, and homeostasis depend on organisms responding to environmental 
cues.
• IST-5: Transmission of information results in changes within and between biological 
systems.
• SYI-1: Living systems are organized in a hierarchy of structural levels that interact.
