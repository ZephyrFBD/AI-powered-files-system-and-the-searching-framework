phase change The conversion of a substance from one state of 
matter to another. The phase changes we consider are melting 
and freezing 1solid ∆ liquid2, sublimation and deposition, and 
vaporization and condensation 1liquid ∆ gas2. (Section 11.4)
phase diagram A graphic representation of the equilibria 
among the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of a substance as a 
function of temperature and pressure. (Sect
