be predicted according to the model. Considering the actual situation, we set 
the linear relationship between the number N of reduced susceptible people 
every week and the total number V of the vaccine set to Sierra Leone: 
V=1.3N 
So we have the forecast of the total number of the vaccine set to Sierra 
Leone every week in the future in Table 3. 
After the vaccine set to the treatment center in Sierra Leone, the 
treatment center would estimate the different demand for drugs of 14 cities. 
Then make the distribution of drugs. Considering that the vaccine distribution 
not only has contact with the number of reduced susceptible people every 
week, but also depends on the density of population of 14 cities, we make the 
assumption that the weight of each city equals to pi*the number  of the 
patient of each ci
