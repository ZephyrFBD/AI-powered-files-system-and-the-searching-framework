the Cdk/cyclin complexes. Without a specific
concentration of fully activated cyclin/Cdk complexes, the cell cycle cannot proceed through the checkpoints.
Although the cyclins are the main regulatory molecules that determine the forward momentum of the cell cycle, there
are several other mechanisms that fine-tune the progress of the cycle with negative, rather than positive, effects. These
mechanisms essentially block the progression of the cell cycle until problematic conditions are resolved. Molecules that
prevent the full activation of Cdks are called Cdk inhibitors. Many of these inhibitor molecules directly or indirectly monitor
a particular cell cycle event. The block placed on Cdks by inhibitor molecules will not be removed until the specific event
that the inhibitor monitors is completed.
