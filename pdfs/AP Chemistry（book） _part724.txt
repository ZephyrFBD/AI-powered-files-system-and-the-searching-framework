sent the 
number of moles of reactants and products producing the associated enthalpy change. 
Balanced chemical equations that show the associated enthalpy change in this way are 
called thermochemical equations.
The exothermic nature of this reaction is also shown in the enthalpy diagram in Figure 5.14. 
Notice that the enthalpy of the reactants is greater (more positive) than the enthalpy of 
the products. Thus, ∆H = Hproducts - Hreactants is negative.
In summary, the change in internal energy is equal to the heat 
gained or lost at constant volume, and the change in enthalpy is 
equal to the heat gained or lost at constant pressure. The difference 
between ∆E and ∆H is the amount of P–V work done by the sys-
tem when the process occurs at constant pressure, -P ∆V. The vol-
ume change accompanying many reactions is close to zero, which 
makes P ∆V and, therefore, the difference between ∆E and ∆H small. 
Under most circumstances, it is generally satisfactory to use ∆H as the 
measure
