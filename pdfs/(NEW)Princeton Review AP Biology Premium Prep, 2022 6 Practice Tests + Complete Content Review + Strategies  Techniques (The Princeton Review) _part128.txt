.) The key here is to clearly and correctly show your work and
understanding, so let’s briefly discuss the important elements in setting up a graph. The favorite type of graph on the
AP Biology Exam is the coordinate graph. The coordinate graph has a horizontal axis (x-axis) and a vertical axis
(y-axis).
The x-axis usually contains the independent variable—the thing that’s being manipulated or changed. The y-axis
contains the dependent variable—the thing that’s affected when the independent variable is changed.
Now let’s look at what happens when you put some points on the graph. Every point on the graph represents both an
independent variable and a dependent variable.
Once you draw both axes and label the axes as x and y, you can plot the points on the graph. We’re just going to
look at (b), which asks us to design an experiment.
Enzymes are biological catalysts.
(b) Construct an experiment that investigates the influence of temperature, substrate concentration, or pH on
