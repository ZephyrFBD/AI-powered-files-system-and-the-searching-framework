CHAPTER 5 Thermochemistry
Constant-Pressure Calorimetry
The techniques and equipment employed in calorimetry depend on the nature of the 
process being studied. For many reactions, such as those occurring in solution, it is easy 
to control pressure so that ∆H is measured directly. Although the calorimeters used for highly 
accurate work are precision instruments, a simple “coffee-cup” calorimeter (Figure 5.18) is of-
ten used in general chemistry laboratories to illustrate the principles of calorimetry. Be-
cause the calorimeter is not sealed, the reaction occurs under the essentially constant 
pressure of the atmosphere.
Imagine adding two aqueous solutions, each containing a reactant, to a coffee-cup 
calorimeter. Once mixed, a reaction occurs. In this case, there is no physical boundary 
between the system and the surroundings. The re
