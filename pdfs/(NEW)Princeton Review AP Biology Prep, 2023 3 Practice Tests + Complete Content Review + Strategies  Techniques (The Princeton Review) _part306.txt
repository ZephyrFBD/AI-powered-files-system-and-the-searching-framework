sex chromosomes. These are called sex-linked traits. Most sex-linked traits are found on the X chromosome and are
more properly referred to as “X-linked.”
Regarding this topic, we are following what the AP currently teaches in terms
of biological sex (not gender), which is defined by sex chromosomes, with
female being XX and male being XY.
Since males have one X and one Y chromosome, what happens if a male has an X-chromosome with the color
blindness allele? Unfortunately, he’ll express the sex-linked trait, even if it is recessive. Why? Because his one and
only X chromosome is color blind-X. He doesn’t have another X to mask the effect of the color blind-X. However,
if a female has only one color blind-X chromosome, she won’t express a recessive sex-linked trait. For her to
express the trait, she has to inherit two color blind-X chromosomes. A female with one color blin
