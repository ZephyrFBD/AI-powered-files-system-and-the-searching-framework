 is
the daughter nucleus? (b) Is the daughter nucleus stable or
radioactive? If the latter, how does it decay, and what is its
half-life? (See Fig. 30–11.) (c) Is the daughter nucleus also
a noble gas, or is it chemically reactive? (d) Suppose 1.4 ng
of 
seeps into a basement. What will be its activity?
If the basement is then sealed, what will be the activity 
1 month later?

54. Consider a system of nuclear power plants that produce
2100 MW. (a) What total mass of 
fuel would be
required to operate these plants for 1 yr, assuming that
200 MeV is released per fission? (b) Typically 6% of the
nuclei that fission produce strontium–90,
