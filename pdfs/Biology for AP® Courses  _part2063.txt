 the diversification of
the finches Darwin observed in the Galapagos.
a.
The finches likely shared a common ancestor
when they came to the island, but exhibited
different traits. Each species of finch settled the
island where its particular traits would be the
most adaptive.
b.
The finches likely originated as one parent
species, but over time mutations caused them to
develop reproductive barriers and separate into
different species. To reduce competition, the
species then radiated out to inhabit different
islands.
c.
The finches likely dispersed from one parent
species, and natural selection based on different
food sources in differing habitats led to adaptive
changes, evidenced in the different beak shapes
of the different species-each suited to a different
food type.
d.
It is likely that a series of cataclysmic events
caused an original finch species to diverge into
the many finch species that inhabited the islands
when Darwin observed them. The different
species then radiated out t
