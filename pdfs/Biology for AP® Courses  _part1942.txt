33. If you had a chance to get your genome sequenced,
what are some questions you might be able to have
answered about yourself?
a.
One can determine the drugs that can rectify a
disease, symptoms of the disease and its severity.
b.
One can determine the ancestry and genetic
origin of diseases and their susceptibility to
drugs.
c.
One can predict the symptoms of a disease, the
vectors to be used in gene therapy and the causal
organism of the disease.
d.
One can determine the pedigree of a disease,
produce recombinants and detect the presence of
extracellular genes using FISH.
34. Describe an example of a genomic mapping method
a.
The radiation mapping method is an example
which uses radiation to break the DNA and is
affected by changes in recombination frequency.
b.
Cytogenetic mapping obtains information from
microscopic analysis of stained chromosomes. It
can estimate t
