ate and the adaptive immune systems
respond to a laceration, such as an injury from falling on a
barbed-wire fence.
(a)
Identify two reasons why the flu vaccination has a fairly low
success rate.
(b)
Respirator Setup
Describe how vaccination is based on immunological memory.
(c)
Explain the purpose of a booster dose (the re-exposure to an
antigen aȇer initial immunization).
(d)
2. Cellular respiration is a process that occurs in many organisms.
The rate of cellular respiration can be determined by measuring
the production of carbon dioxide and/or the consumption of
oxygen. To investigate respiration rate at two diﬀerent
temperatures, students used a respirator (see diagram above) to
measure oxygen consumption of non-germinating and
germinating corn seeds, recording the following results:
