 stretched
(shown as 
in Fig. 6–15 for clarity). The work done is then
Hence the elastic potential energy,
is proportional to the square of the amount
stretched:
[elastic spring]
(6;9)
If a spring is compressed a distance x from its natural (“equilibrium”) length, the
average force again has magnitude
and again the potential energy is
given by Eq.6–9. Thus x can be either the amount compressed or amount stretched
from the spring’s natural length.† Note that for a spring, we choose the reference
point for zero PE at the spring’s natural position.
Potential Energy as Stored Energy
In the above examples of potential energy—from a brick held at a height y, to a
stretched or compressed spring—an object has the capacity or potential to do work
even though it is not yet actually doing it. These examples show that energy can be
stored, for later use, in the form of potential energy (as in Fig. 6–13, for a spring).
Note that there is a single universal formula for the translational kinetic ener
