FIGURE 18–12 The resistance value of a given resistor is written on 
the exterior, or may be given as a color code as shown below and in 
the Table: the first two colors represent the first two digits in the value 
of the resistance, the third color represents the power of ten that it 
must be multiplied by, and the fourth is the manufactured tolerance.
For example, a resistor whose four colors are red, green, yellow, and
silver has a resistance of
plus or
minus 10%. [An alternative code is a number such as 104, which means
]
R = 1.0 * 104 .
25 * 104  = 250,000  = 250 k,
