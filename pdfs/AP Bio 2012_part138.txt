pe of  
an organism.
(A)
This option is incorrect. Environmental contamination in Lake Apopka had a 
negative effect on the enzyme in females by decreasing the activity, not increasing 
the activity, as in Lake Woodruff, which was not contaminated.
(B)
This option is correct. In Lake Woodruff, the lake that is relatively pristine, 
females had high levels of oxido-reductase enzyme activity, but in Lake 
Apopka, where environmental contamination conditions were severe, the 
enzyme activity was low, indicating that environmental factors had an 
influence on the organism.
(C)
This option is incorrect. Environmental contamination in both lakes did not seem 
to influence the enzyme for activity for males.
(D)
This option is incorrect. Environmental contamination in both lakes did not seem 
to influence the enzyme for activity for males.
