n an ionic com-
pound must equal the total negative charge of the anions.
NAMING INORGANIC COMPOUNDS (SECTION  2.8) The set of rules 
for naming chemical compounds is called chemical nomenclature. We 
studied the systematic rules used for naming three classes of inorganic 
substances: ionic compounds, acids, and binary molecular compounds. 
In naming an ionic compound, the cation is named first and then the 
anion. Cations formed from metal  
atoms have the same name as the 
metal. If the metal can form cations of differing charges, the charge is 
given using Roman numerals. Monatomic anions have names ending 
in -ide. Polyatomic anions containing oxygen and another element 
 
(oxyanions) have names ending in -ate or -ite. In naming binary molecu-
lar compounds, Greek prefixes are used to denote the number of each 
 
element in the molecular formula, and the element farthest to the left in 
the periodic table (closest to metallic elements) is generally written first.
