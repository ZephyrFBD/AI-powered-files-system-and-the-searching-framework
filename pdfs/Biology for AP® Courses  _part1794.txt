acetyl, and ubiquitin groups.
The addition or removal of these groups from proteins regulates their activity or the length of time they exist in the cell.
Sometimes these modifications can regulate where a protein is found in the cell—for example, in the nucleus, the cytoplasm,
or attached to the plasma membrane.
Chemical modifications occur in response to external stimuli such as stress, the lack of nutrients, heat, or ultraviolet light
exposure. These changes can alter epigenetic accessibility, transcription, mRNA stability, or translation—all resulting in
changes in expression of various genes. This is an efficient way for the cell to rapidly change the levels of specific proteins
in response to the environment. Because proteins are involved in every stage of gene regulation, the phosphorylation
of a protein (depending on the protein that is modified) can alter accessibility to the chromosome, can alter translation
(by altering transcription factor binding or function), can change n
