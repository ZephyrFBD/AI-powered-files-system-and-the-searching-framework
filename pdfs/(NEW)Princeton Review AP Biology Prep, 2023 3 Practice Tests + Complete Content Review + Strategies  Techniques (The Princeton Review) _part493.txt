 range) and graphs are
used to summarize data and show patterns and conclusions:
Normal (parametric) measurement data are summarized by using mean and standard deviation or standard
error.
Parametric data are summarized by using median, mode, and range.
Histograms can be used to see if a dataset has a standard deviation or not.
Count data is summarized in a bar graph or a pie graph.
Time course experiments look at how something changes over time; summarize these using a line graph.
Experiments that compare groups are summarized in a bar graph (if the dataset has a standard deviation) or a
box-and-whisker plot (if it does not).
Scatterplots summarize association experiments, and regression lines can be used to determine if the
relationship is linear.
Probability can be calculated with the sum rule or the product rule.
Hypothesis testing is used to determine if two groups are significantly different from each other. They start with
a null hypothesis, which is rejected or accepted, depend
