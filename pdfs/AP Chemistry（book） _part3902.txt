 to participate in the fascinating world of 
chemical research by enrolling in an undergraduate research pro-
gram. Given all the answers that chemists seem to have, you may 
be surprised at the large number of questions that they still find 
to ask.
Finally, we hope you have enjoyed using this textbook. We cer-
tainly enjoyed putting so many of our thoughts about chemistry on 
paper. We truly believe it to be the central science, one that benefits 
all who learn about it and from it.

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (IN-
TRODUCTION AND SECTION 24.1) This chapter introduces organic 
chemistry, which is the study of carbon compounds (typically com-
pounds containing carbon–carbon bonds), and biochemistry, which is 
the study of the chemistry of living organisms. C ¬ C single bonds 
and C ¬ H bonds tend to have low reactivity. Those bonds that have 
a high electron density (su
