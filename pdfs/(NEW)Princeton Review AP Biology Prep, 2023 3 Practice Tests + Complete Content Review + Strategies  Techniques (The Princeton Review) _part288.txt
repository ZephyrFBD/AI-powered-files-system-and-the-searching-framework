rm, genetics is the study of heredity. It explains how certain characteristics are
passed on from parents to children. Much of what we know about genetics was discovered by the monk Gregor
Mendel in the 19th century. Since then, the field of genetics has vastly expanded.
Let’s begin then with some of the fundamental points of genetics:
Traits—or expressed characteristics—are influenced by one or more of your genes. Remember, a gene is
simply a chunk of DNA that codes for a particular recipe. Different recipes affect different traits. DNA is passed
from generation to generation, and from this process the genes and the traits associated with those genes are
inherited. Within a chromosome, there are many genes, and each can contribute to a different trait. For example,
in pea plants, there’s a gene on a chromosome that codes for seed coat characteristics. The position of a gene on
a chromosome is called a locus.
Diploid organisms (organisms that have two sets of chromosomes) usually have
