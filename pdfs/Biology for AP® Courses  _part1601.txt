 thymine cannot form thymine dimers
and they are not able to repair this defect. The
non-formation of dimers distorts the structure of
DNA and they have high risk of contracting skin
cancer.
68. You are looking at two fragments of DNA. Both have
the sequence CATTCTG on one strand and GTAAGAC on
the other. One of the fragments is exposed to UV light, the
other is not. What will happen to the fragments and how
might these mutations be repaired?
a.
The fragment exposed to UV light contains
thymine dimers. Thymines lying adjacent to
each other can form thymine dimers when
exposed to UV light. They can be repaired by
nucleotide excision.
b.
The fragment exposed to UV light contains
adenine dimers. Adenines lying adjacent to each
other can form dimers when exposed to UV
light. They can be repaired by nucleotide
excision.
c.
The fragment exposed to UV light contains
thymine dimers. Thymines lying parallel to each
other can form thymine dimers when exposed to
UV light. They can be repaired by
