x axis to be east and the positive y axis to
be north, since those are the compass directions used on most maps. The origin
of the xy coordinate system is at the post office. We resolve each vector into its
x and y components. We add the x components together, and then the y compo-
nents together, giving us the x and y components of the resultant.
SOLUTION Resolve each displacement vector into its components, as shown
in Fig. 3–15b. Since 
has magnitude 22.0 km and points north, it has only a 
y component:
has both x and y components:
Notice that 
is negative because this vector component points along the
negative y axis. The resultant vector,
has components:
This specifies the resultant vector completely:
We can also specify the resultant vector by giving its magnitude and angle using
Eqs. 3–4:
A calculator with a key labeled INV TAN, or ARC
TAN, or
gives
The negative sign means
below the 
x axis, Fig. 3–15c. So, the resultant displacement is 30.0 km directed at 38.5°
