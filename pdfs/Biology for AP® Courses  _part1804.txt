he
reversible nature of these processes. Indeed, many researchers are testing how a silenced gene can be switched back on in a
cancer cell to help re-establish normal growth patterns.
Genes involved in the development of many other illnesses, ranging from allergies to inflammation to autism, are thought to
be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. As our knowledge of how genes are controlled deepens, new ways to treat diseases
like cancer will emerge.
Cancer and Transcriptional Control
Alterations in cells that give rise to cancer can affect the transcriptional control of gene expression. Mutations that activate
transcription factors, such as increased phosphorylation, can increase the binding of a transcription factor to its binding
site in a promoter. This could lead to increased transcriptional activation of that gene that results in modified cell growth.
Alternatively, a mutation in the DNA of a promoter or enhancer region can increase the binding ability of a transcription
factor. Th
