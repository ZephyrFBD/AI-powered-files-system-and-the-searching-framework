ragments.
b.
DNA polymerase I adds the RNA primers to the
already developing copy of DNA. DNA ligase
separates the ends of the new segment,
especially the Okazaki fragments.
c.
DNA polymerase I seals the ends of the new
segment, especially the Okazaki fragments.
DNA ligase removes the RNA primers from the
developing copy of DNA.
d.
DNA polymerase I removes the enzyme primase
from the developing copy of DNA. DNA ligase
seals the ends of the old segment, especially the
Okazaki fragments.
47. If the rate of replication in a particular prokaryote is
900 nucleotides per second, how long would it take to
make two copies of a 1.2 million base pair genome?
a.
22.2 minutes
b.
44.4 minutes
c.
45.4 minutes
d.
54.4 minutes
48. How do the linear chromosomes in eukaryotes ensure
that their ends are replicated completely?
a.
The ends of the linear chromosomes are
maintained by the activity of the telomerase
enzyme.
b.
The ends of the linear chromosomes are
maintained by the formation of a replication
