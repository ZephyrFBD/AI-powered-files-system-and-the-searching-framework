■ Summative Assessment 
The ideal postlab assessment would be the application of model and theory to a real-
world situation, such as that referenced in the section Where Can Students Go from 
Here? Be sure that all students/student teams treat their model spaces as experimental 
spaces. Have them propose, test, and analyze specific hypotheses and report these in a 
miniposter presentation that is designed to generate a rigorous peer review before the 
teacher evaluation. 
■ Where Can Students Go from Here? 
The ultimate laboratory learning experience would be to develop a model and then try 
out that model in the real world. An excellent extension to the modeling and theory 
work in this laboratory would be to have the students work through the following 
laboratory reported in the ABLE Proceedings: “Supertasters — Updating the Taste Test 
for the A & P Laboratory.” There are few human traits that express the intermediate 
dominance necessary for testing for the null hyp
