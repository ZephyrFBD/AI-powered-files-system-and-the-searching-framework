Technicians are looking at an MRI
image of sections through a patient’s
body. MRI is one of several
powerful types of medical imaging
based on physics used by doctors to
diagnose illnesses.
This Chapter opens with basic
and important physics topics of
nuclear reactions, nuclear fission,
and nuclear fusion, and how we
obtain nuclear energy. Then we
examine the health aspects of
radiation—dosimetry, therapy, and
imaging: MRI, PET, and SPECT.
Since then, a great many nuclear reactions have been observed. Indeed, many
of the radioa
