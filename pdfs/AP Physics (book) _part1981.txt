o a few hundred ohms.
Electric energy is transformed into thermal energy or light in such devices,
and there are many collisions between the moving electrons and the atoms of the
wire. In each collision, part of the electron’s kinetic energy is transferred to the
atom with which it collides. As a result, the kinetic energy of the wire’s atoms
increases and hence the temperature (Section 13–9) of the wire element increases.
The increased thermal energy can be transferred as heat by conduction and
convection to the air in a heater or to food in a pan, by radiation to bread in a
toaster, or radiated as light.

To find the power transformed by an electric device, recall that the energy
transformed when a charge Q moves through a potential difference V is QV
(Eq. 17–3). Then the power P, which is the rate energy is transf
