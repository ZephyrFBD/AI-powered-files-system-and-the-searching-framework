8. Cats with two X chromosomes are female, and cats with one X and one Y chromosome are male. The gene for
fur color in cats is on the X chromosome: XB is the black allele and Xo is the orange allele. Cats who are
heterozygous express the calico phenotype, with patches of black fur and patches of orange fur. A female calico
cat is mated with a black male cat. Which of the following best describes the predicted ratios of their offspring?
(A)
 of the offspring would be female calico cats, and  of the offspring would be male black cats.
(B)
 of the offspring would be female black cats,  of the offspring would be female calico cats,  of the
offspring would be male black cats, and
