hanges in response to a change in the environment. Rather, the frequency
of an allele in the population may change.
PROBLEM 3
Determine the percent of the population that is hybrid if the allelic frequency of the
recessive trait is 0.5.
In this example, you are given the value of q (not q2). You only need to
subtract from 1 to get the value of p.
If p + q = 1 and q = 0.5, then p + 0.5 = 1.
Since both p = 0.5 and q = 0.5, the percentage of the population that is
hybrid is 2pq = 0.5 × 0.5 × 2 = 50%.
SPECIATION AND REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION
The definition of a species is a population whose members have the
potential to interbreed in nature and produce viable, fertile offspring. Lions
and tigers can be induced to interbreed in captivity but would not do so
naturally. Therefore, they are considered separate species. Horses and
donkeys can interbreed in nature and produce a mule that is not fertile.
Therefore, the horse and donkey belong to different species.
A species is defined in terms of re
