Selective Permeability
Plasma membranes are asymmetric: the interior of the membrane is not identical to the exterior of the membrane. In fact,
there is a considerable difference between the array of phospholipids and proteins between the two leaflets that form a
membrane. On the interior of the membrane, some proteins serve to anchor the membrane to fibers of the cytoskeleton.
There are peripheral proteins on the exterior of the membrane that bind elements of the extracellular matrix. Carbohydrates,
attached to lipids or proteins, are also found on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane. These carbohydrate complexes
help the cell bind substances that the cell needs in the extracellular fluid. This adds considerably to the selective nature of
plasma membranes (Figure 5.7).
Figure 5.7 The exterior surface of the plasma membrane is not identical to the interior surface of the same membrane.
Recall that plas
