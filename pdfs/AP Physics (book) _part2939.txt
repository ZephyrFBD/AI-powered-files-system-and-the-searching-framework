26–7 Relativistic Momentum
So far in this Chapter, we have seen that two basic mechanical quantities, length
and time intervals, need modification because they are relative—their value
depends on the reference frame from which they are measured. We might expect
that other physical quantities might need some modification according to the
theory of relativity, such as momentum and energy.
The analysis of collisions between two particles shows that if we want to
preserve the law of conservation of momentum in relativity, we must redefine
momentum as

as before (Eq. 26–2). For speeds much
less than the speed of light, Eq. 26–4 gives the classical momentum,
Relativistic momentum has been tested many times on tiny elementary particles
(such as muons), and it has been found to behave in accord with Eq. 26–4.
