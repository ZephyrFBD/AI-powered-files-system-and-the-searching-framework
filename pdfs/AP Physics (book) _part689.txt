s more momentum than a small car moving
with the same speed. The more momentum an object has, the harder it is to stop
it, and the greater effect it will have on another object if it is brought to rest by
striking that object. A football player is more likely to be stunned if tackled by a
heavy opponent running at top speed than by a lighter or slower-moving tackler.
A heavy, fast-moving truck can do more damage than a slow-moving motorcycle.
EXERCISE A Can a small sports car ever have the same momentum as a large sport-
utility vehicle with three times the sports car’s mass? Explain.
A force is required to change the momentum of an object, whether to 
increase the momentum, to decrease it, or to change its direction. Newton origi-
nally stated his second law in terms of momentum (although he called the product
mv the “quantity of motion”). Newton’s statement of the second law of motion,
translated into modern language, is as follows:
The rate of change of momentum of an object is equa
