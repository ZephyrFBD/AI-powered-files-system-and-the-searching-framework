 the diverse demands of the
topography, the limited movement of people, and the demands created by crop rotation for different varieties that will do
well in different fields.
Potatoes are only one example of human-generated diversity. Every plant, animal, and fungus that has been cultivated by
humans has been bred from original wild ancestor species into diverse varieties arising from the demands for food value,
adaptation to growing conditions, and resistance to pests. The potato demonstrates a well-known example of the risks of low
crop diversity: the tragic Irish potato famine when the single variety grown in Ireland became susceptible to a potato blight,
wiping out the crop. The loss of the crop led to famine, death, and mass emigration. Resistance to disease is a chief benefit
to maintaining crop biodiversity, and lack of diversity in contemporary crop species carries similar risks. Seed companies,
which are the source of most crop varieties in developed countries, must continual
