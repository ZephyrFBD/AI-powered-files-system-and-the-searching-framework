ives transpiration, but also causes massive water loss from the plant. Up to
90 percent of the water taken up by roots may be lost through transpiration.
Leaves are covered by a waxy cuticle on the outer surface that prevents the loss of water. Regulation of transpiration,
therefore, is achieved primarily through the opening and closing of stomata on the leaf surface. Stomata are surrounded by
two specialized cells called guard cells, which open and close in response to environmental cues such as light intensity and
quality, leaf water status, and carbon dioxide concentrations. Stomata must open to allow air containing carbon dioxide and
oxygen to diffuse into the leaf for photosynthesis and respiration. When stomata are open, however, water vapor is lost to
the external environment, increasing the rate of transpiration. Therefore, plants must maintain a balance between efficient
photosynthesis and water loss.
Plants have evolved over time to adapt to their local environment and reduce
