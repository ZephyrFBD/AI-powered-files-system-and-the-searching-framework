 in regions that
have been physically separated for millions of years by geographic barriers. Biologists estimate that Australia, for example,
has between 600,000 and 700,000 species of plants and animals. Approximately 3/4 of living plant and mammal species are
endemic species found solely in Australia (Figure 35.6ab).

Sometimes ecologists discover unique patterns of species distribution by determining where species are not found. Hawaii,
for example, has no native land species of reptiles or amphibians, and has only one native t
