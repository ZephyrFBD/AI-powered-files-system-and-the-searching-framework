ower blood sugar.
d.
Positive feedback loop cannot proceed in
diabetic individuals, as they do not produce
enough functional insulin to increase the blood
sugar.
35. What are the roles of vasodilation and vasoconstriction
in maintaining body temperature?
a.
Vasodilation allows for radiation and
evaporative heat loss, and vasoconstriction
brings blood to the core to conserve heat by vital
organs.
b.
Vasodilation brings blood to the core to conserve
heat by vital organs, and vasoconstriction results
in radiation and evaporative heat loss.
c.
Vasodilation results in the formation of an
insulating layer between skin and internal organs
causing heat conservation and brings blood to
the core to conserve heat.
d.
Vasodilation results in radiation and evaporative
heat loss, and vasoconstriction transfers heat
from arteries to veins to warm blood returning to
the heart.
