d become extinct. In particular, species with specialized diets or
habitat requirements (like the giant panda that feeds mainly on bamboo)
are more vulnerable to environmental changes. Generalist species like
raccoons, on the other hand, are more able to survive because they feed
on a wide variety of food and live in various habitats. With respect to
population size, species with long generation times that produce few
oﬀspring (like rhinoceroses) are more subject to extinction than species
with short generation times that produce many oﬀspring (like rodents).
The ability to increase in population quickly allows species to recover
from low populations caused by disturbances and diseases.
The following are examples of species that became extinct in the wild but
are being bred in captivity and then released back into the wild. Their low
genetic diversity, however, keeps them at risk for extinction and makes
them endangered species. California condors, prior to humans hunting
and poisoning
