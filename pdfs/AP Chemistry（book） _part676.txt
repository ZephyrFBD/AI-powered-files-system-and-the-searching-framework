 4.113 The arsenic in a 1.22-g sample of a pesticide was converted to 
AsO4
3- by suitable chemical treatment. It was then titrated 
using Ag+ to form Ag3AsO4 as a precipitate. (a) What is the 
oxidation state of As in AsO4
3-? (b) Name Ag3AsO4 by anal-
ogy to the corresponding compound containing phospho-
rus in place of arsenic. (c) If it took 25.0 mL of 0.102 M Ag+ 
to reach the equivalence point in this titration, what is the 
mass percentage of arsenic in the pesticide?
 4.114 The U.S. standard for arsenate in drinking water requires that 
public water supplies must contain no greater than 10 parts 
per billion (ppb) arsenic. If this arsenic is present as arsenate, 
AsO4
3-, what mass of sodium arsenate would be present in 
a 1.00-L sample of drinking water that just meets the stan-
dard? Parts per billion is defined on a mass basis as
ppb =
g solute
g solution * 109
 4.115 Federal regulations set an upper limit of 50 part
