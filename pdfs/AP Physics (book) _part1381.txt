Today the atomic theory is universally accepted. The experimental evidence
in its favor, however, came mainly in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth
centuries, and much of it was obtained from the analysis of chemical reactions.
We will often speak of the relative masses of individual atoms and molecules—
what we call the atomic mass or molecular mass, respectively. (The terms atomic
weight and molecular weight are sometimes used.) These masses are based on
