p and transport Na+ and K+ ions. ATP performs
cellular work using this basic form of energy coupling through phosphorylation.

Figure 6.14 The sodium-potassium pump is an example of energy coupling. The energy derived from exergonic
ATP hydrolysis is used to pump sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane.
The hydrolysis of one ATP molecule releases 7.3 kcal/mol of energy (ΔG = −7.3 kcal/mol of energy ) . If it takes
2.1 kcal/mol of energy to move one Na+
across the membrane (ΔG = +2.1 kcal/mol of energy ) , what is the
maximum number of sodium ions that could be moved by the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule?

Often during cellular metabolic reactions, such as the synthesis and breakdown of nutrients, certain molecules must
be altered slightly in their conformation to become substrates for the next step in the reaction series. One example is
during the very first steps of cellular respiration, when a molecule of the sugar g
