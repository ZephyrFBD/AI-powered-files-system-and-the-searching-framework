  
is also a conser-
vative force. An object that starts at a given point and returns to that same point
under the action of a conservative force has no net work done on it because the
potential energy is the same at the start and the finish of such a round trip.
Many forces, such as friction and a push or pull exerted by a person, are 
nonconservative forces since any work they do depends on the path. For example,
if you push a crate across a floor from one point to another, the work you do
depends on whether the path taken is straight or is curved. As shown in Fig. 6–16,
if a crate is pushed slowly from point 1 to point 2 along the longer semicircular
path, you do more work against friction than if you push it along the straight path.
