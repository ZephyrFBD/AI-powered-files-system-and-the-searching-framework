LRC circuit. Suppose 
and
in Fig. 21–43, and they are connected in series to a 90.0-V ac (rms)
500-Hz source. Calculate (a) the current in the circuit, and (b) the voltmeter
readings (rms) across each element.
APPROACH To obtain the current, we determine the impedance (Eq. 21–15
plus Eqs. 21–11b and 21–12b), and then use
(Eq. 21–14). Voltage
drops across each element are found using Ohm’s law or equivalent for each
element:
and
SOLUTION (a) First, we find the reactance of the inductor and capacitor at
Then the total impedance is
From the impedance version of Ohm’s law
