SOLUTION The volume of the sphere is
From Table 10–1, the density of iron is
so Eq. 10–1 gives
m = rV = A7800 kgm3BA0.024 m3B
= 190 kg.
r = 7800 kgm3,
V =

†Section 9–5.
The specific gravity of a substance is defined as the ratio of the density 
of that substance to the density of water at 4.0°C. Because specific gravity 
(abbreviated SG) is a ratio, it is a simple number without dimensions or 
units. For example (see Table 10–1), the specific gravity of lead is 11.3
The SG of alcohol is 0.79.
The concepts of density and specific gravity are especially helpful in the study
of fluids because we are not always dealing with a fixed volume or mass.
10–3 Pressure in Fluids
Pressure and force are related, but they are not the same thing. Pressure is defined
as force per unit area, where the force F is understood to be the magnitude of 
the force acting perpendicular to the surface area A:
