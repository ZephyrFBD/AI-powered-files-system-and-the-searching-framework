luid surrounding a patient’s red blood cells is depleted in 
electrolytes, is crenation or hemolysis more likely to occur?
Crenation of red blood cell placed 
in hypertonic environment
Red blood cell in isotonic medium 
neither swells nor shrinks.
Hemolysis of red blood cell placed 
in hypotonic environment

▲ Figure 13.23 Osmosis through red blood cell walls. If water moves out of the red blood cell, it  
shrivels (crenation); if water moves into the red blood cell, it will swell and may burst (hemolysis).
The average osmotic pressure of blood is 7.7 atm at 25 °C. What molarity of glucose 1C6H12O62 will be isotonic with blood?
Sample Exercise 13.9 
Osmotic Pressure Calculations
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to calculate the concentration of glucose in 
water that would be isotonic with blood, given that the osmotic 
pressure of
