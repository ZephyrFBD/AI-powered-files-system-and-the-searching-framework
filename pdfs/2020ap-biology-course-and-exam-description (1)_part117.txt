ompetitive inhibitor molecules can bind 
reversibly or irreversibly to the active site of 
the enzyme. Noncompetitive inhibitors can 
bind allosteric sites, changing the activity of 
the enzyme.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-1.H
Describe the role of energy in 
living organisms.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-1.H.1
All living systems require constant input of 
energy.
ENE-1.H.2
Life requires a highly ordered system and does 
not violate the second law of thermodynamics—
a. 
Energy input must exceed energy 
loss to maintain order and to power 
cellular processes.
b. 
Cellular processes that release energy may 
be coupled with cellular processes that
