ates will decrease and our population could
crash.

This graph shows a predator-prey cycle for wolves and
moose. Explain why the graphs do not resemble the
idealized graphs used as models of the predator-prey cycle.
a.
This graph reflects all of the influences on both
populations in addition to the predator-prey
influences.
b.
This graph reflects all of the influences on both
populations, but not the predator-prey
influences.
c.
This graph reflects just the influence of predator-
prey interactions on both populations.
d.
This graph reflects some of the influences on
both populations other than the predator-prey
influences.
70. Suppose a population of lizards becomes divided into
two groups on two different islands after a devastating
tsunami. No predators of the lizard are present on one
island, and on the other island is a fierce predator that uses
the lizard as its primary source of food. Assuming both
populations encounter similar environments in every other
way, and both survive
