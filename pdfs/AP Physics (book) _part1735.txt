n one is directed toward the other (they attract). See Fig. 16–15.
Notice that the force one charge exerts on the second is equal but opposite to
that exerted by the second on the first, in accord with Newton’s third law.
The SI unit of charge is the coulomb (C). The precise definition of the coulomb
today is in terms of electric current and magnetic field, and will be discussed later
(Section 20–6). In SI units, the constant k in Coulomb’s law has the value
or, when we only need two significant figures,
Thus, 1 C is that amount of charge which, if placed on each of two point 
objects that are 1.0 m apart, will result in each object exerting a force of
on the other. This
would be an enormous force, equal to the weight of almost a million tons. We
rarely encounter charges as large as a coulomb.†
Charges produced by rubbing ordinary objects (such as a comb or plastic
ruler) are typically around a microcoulomb 
or less. Objects that
carry a positive charge have a deficit of electrons, whe
