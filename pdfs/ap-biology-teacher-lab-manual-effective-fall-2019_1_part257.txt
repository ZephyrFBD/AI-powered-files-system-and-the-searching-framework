■ Getting Started: Prelab Assessment 
You may assign the following questions for homework; as a think, pair/group, share 
activity, in which pairs or small groups of students brainstorm ideas and then share them 
with other groups; or as a whole-class discussion to assess students’ understanding of key 
concepts pertaining to cladograms: 
1. Use the following data to construct a cladogram of the major plant groups:

2. GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) is an enzyme that catalyzes 
the sixth step in glycolysis, an important reaction in the process of cellular 
respiration. The following data table shows the percentage similarity of this gene and 
the protein it expresses in humans versus other species. For example, according to 
the table, the GAPDH gene in chimpanzees is 99.6
