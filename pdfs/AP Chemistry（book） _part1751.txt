solid. A supercooled liquid is unstable; particles of dust enter-
ing the solution or gentle stirring is often sufficient to cause the substance to solidify 
quickly.
Critical temperature and Pressure
A gas normally liquefies at some point when pressure is applied. Suppose we have a cylin-
der fitted with a piston and the cylinder contains water vapor at 100 °C. If we increase the 
pressure on the water vapor, liquid water will form when the pressure is 760 torr. However, 
if the temperature is 110 °C, the liquid phase does not form until the pressure is 1075 torr. 
At 374 °C the liquid phase forms only at 1.655 * 105 torr 1217.7 atm2. Above this tem-
perature, no amount of pressure causes a distinct liquid phase to form. Instead, as pressure 
increases, the gas becomes steadily more compressed. The highest temperature at which 
a distinct liquid phase can form is called the critical temperature. The critical pres-
sure is the pressure required to bring about liquefaction at this criti
