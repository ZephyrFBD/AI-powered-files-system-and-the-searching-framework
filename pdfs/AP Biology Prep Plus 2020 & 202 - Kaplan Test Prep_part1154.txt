t (A).
31. D
Growling at other Group 1 members as detailed in (A) would not help in
competing against Group 2. Similarly, waiting for Group 2 lemurs to leave
before looking for plants would not give Group 1 lemurs any competitive
advantage, eliminating (B). However, if Group 1 learned to chatter when
they found plants, Group 2 lemurs would interpret the chattering as a
signal for danger and stay away, making (D) correct. (C) is incorrect
because shouting, while a sign of danger for Group 1 lemurs, would be
heard as a greeting by Group 2 lemurs and fail to drive them away.
32. A
This question is asking for an explanation as to why the population of
Group 1 decreases despite an increase in the amount of fruit available.
While (B) could be a plausible reason for a decrease in population, it refers
to only Group 2, not Group 1. (C) would not be expected to result in a
decrease in population. Introducing a third group of lemurs could create
competition, but with no information about Group 1
