 which variables have 
numeric values given. Every time you encounter a numerical 
value, jot it down. In many cases, constructing a table of the 
given information will be useful.
 2. Convert to consistent units. Make certain that quantities are 
converted to the proper units. In using the ideal-gas equation, for 
example, we usually use the value of R that has units of L-atm/
mol-K. If you are given a pressure in torr, you will need to convert 
it to atmospheres before using this value of R in your calculations.
 3. If a single equation relates the variables, solve the equation 
for the unknown. For the ideal-gas equation, these algebraic re-
arrangements will all be used at one time or another:
 
P = nRT
V , V = nRT
P , n = PV
RT
  , T = PV
nR 
 4. Use dimensional analysis. Carry the units through your cal-
culation. Using dimensional analysis enables you to check that 
you have solved an equation correctly. If the units in the equa-
tion cancel to give the units of the desired vari
