up to 100%.
• Percent yield =
actual yield
theoretical yield * 100%  
[3.14] 
This is the formula to calculate the percent yield of a 
reaction. The percent yield can never be more than 
100%.

 Based on this diagram, which equation best describes the 
 
reaction? [Section 3.1 ]
(a) A2 + B ¡ A2B
(b) A2 + 4 B ¡ 2 AB2
(c) 2 A + B4 ¡ 2 AB2
(d) A + B2 ¡ AB2
 
3.2 The following diagram shows the combination reaction 
 
between hydrogen, H2, and carbon monoxide, CO, to 
 
produce methanol, CH3OH (white spheres are H, black spheres 
are C, red spheres are O). The correct number of CO molecules 
 
involved in this reaction is not shown. [Section 3.1]
(a) Determine the number of CO molecules that should be 
shown in the left (reactants) box.
(b) Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction.
