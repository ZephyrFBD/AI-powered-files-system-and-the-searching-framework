 describe physiological or
behavioral traits, as well). The term genotype is also used to describe just those alleles under discussion (or even all
of an individualâ€™s alleles), and its phenotype is used to describe the expression of those alleles.
Gregor Mendel, a nineteenth-century monk, is credited with the discovery of the laws of segregation and
independent assortment. The following laws describe the separation of chromosomes during meiosis (Figure 8-2).
Because the distribution of alleles among gametes is random, the rules of probability can be used to describe how
the different chromosomes (and their alleles) in parents assemble in offspring.
1. The law of segregation refers to the segregation (separation) of alleles (and their chromosomes) to individual
gametes. In other words, one member of each chromosome pair migrates to an opposite pole so that each gamete
contains only one copy of each chromosome (and each allele).
2. The law of independent assortment refers to the independ
