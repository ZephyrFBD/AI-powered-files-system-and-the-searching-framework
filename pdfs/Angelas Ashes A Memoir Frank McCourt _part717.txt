er a favor and cash the money order 
 
 and get her a little Baby Powers whiskey at the pub, a loaf of bread, a 
 
 pound of lard, seven potatoes, one for each day of the week.Would I 
 
 boil a potato for her, mash it up with a lump of lard, give her a cut of 
 
 bread, bring her a drop of water to go with the whiskey? Would I go 
 
 to O’Connor the chemist for ointment for her sores and while I’m at 
 
 it bring some soap so she can give her body a good scrub and she’ll be 
 
 forever grateful and say a prayer for me and here’s a couple of shillings 
 
 for all my troubles. 
 
 Ah, no thanks, ma’am. 
 
  
  
 Take the money. Little tip.You did me great favors. 
 
 I couldn’t, ma’am, the way you are. 
 
 Take the money or I’ll tell the post office you’re not to deliver my 
 
 telegram anymore. 
 
 Oh, all right, ma’am.Thanks very much. 
 
 Good night, son. Be good to your mother. 
 
 Good night, Mrs. Daly.
