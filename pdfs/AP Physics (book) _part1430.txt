closely, and indeed the gas we now describe is referred to as
an ideal gas. The assumptions representing the basic postulates of kinetic theory
for an ideal gas are:
1. There are a large number of molecules, N, each of mass m, moving in random
directions with a variety of speeds. This assumption agrees with our observation
that a gas fills its container and, in the case of air on Earth, is kept from
escaping only by the force of gravity.
2. The molecules are, on average, far apart from one another. That is, their average
separation is much greater than the diameter of each molecule.
3. The molecules are assumed to obey the laws of classical mechanics, and are
assumed to interact with one another only when they collide.Although molecules
exert weak attractive forces on each other between collisions, the potential
energy associated with these forces is small compared to the kinetic energy.
4. Collisions with another molecule or the wall of the vessel are assumed to be
perfectly elastic,
