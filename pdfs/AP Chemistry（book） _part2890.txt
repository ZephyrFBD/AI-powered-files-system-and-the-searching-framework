ion of NO2 initiates the reactions associated with photochemical 
smog. Dissociation of NO2 requires 304 kJ>mol, which corresponds to a photon wave-
length of 393 nm. In sunlight, therefore, NO2 dissociates to NO and O:
 
NO21g2 + hn ยก NO1g2 + O1g2 
[18.13]
The atomic oxygen formed undergoes several reactions, one of which gives ozone, as de-
scribed earlier:
 
O1g2 + O21g2 + M1g2 ยก O31g2 + M*1g2 
[18.14]
Although it is essential to screen out harmful UV radiation in the upper atmosphere, 
ozone is an undesirable pollutant in the troposphere. It is extremely reactive and toxic, 
and breathing air that contains appreciable amounts of ozone can be especially danger-
ous for asthma sufferers, exercisers, and the elderly. We therefore have two ozone prob-
lems: excessive amounts in many urban environments, where it is harmful, and depletion 
in the stratosphere, where its presence is vital.
In addition to nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, an automobile engine also emits 
unburned hydroc
