chromosomes.
c.
The cell is diploid.
d.
The cell is prokaryotic.
35. Explain how DNA, which in humans measures
approximately two meters, can fit inside a human cell that
is about 10 Âµm . Discuss how the organization of the
genetic material in eukaryotes differs from prokaryotes.
a.
The DNA is found wrapped around histones to
form nucleosomes, which further compact and
ultimately form linear chromosomes. The
prokaryotic genome is found as a loop and in
eukaryotes as a double-stranded linear structure.
b.
The DNA is wrapped around the nucleosomes to
show a compact structure. The eukaryotes show
a loop structure and prokaryotes show a double-
stranded linear genome.
c.
The genetic material shows ringed
heterochromatin structure. The prokaryotes
show multiple loops, and eukaryotes show a
condensed chromatin.
d.
The genetic material is wrapped around histones.
The prokaryotes have a condensed structure in
nucleoids, but eukaryotes have double-stranded
linear structure.
