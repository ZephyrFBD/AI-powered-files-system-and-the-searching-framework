ave the same spin magnetic quantum 
number. Electrons arranged in this way are said to have parallel spins. For a carbon atom 
to achieve its lowest energy, therefore, the two 2p electrons must have the same spin. For 
this to happen, the electrons must be in different 2p orbitals, as shown in Table 6.3. Thus, 
a carbon atom in its ground state has two unpaired electrons.
Nitrogen, Oxygen, Fluorine Similarly, for nitrogen in its ground state, Hund’s rule 
requires that the three 2p electrons singly occupy each of the three 2p orbitals. This is 
the only way that all three electrons can have the same spin. For oxygen and fluorine, we 
place four and five electrons, respectively, in the 2p orbitals. To achieve this, we pair up 
electrons in the 2p orbitals, as we will see in Sample Exercise 6.7.
Hund’s rule is based in part on the fact that electrons repel one another. By occu-
pying different orbitals, the electrons remain as far as possible from one another, thus 
minimizing electron–e
