ficients in the balanced equation. We then use the quantity  
of the limiting reactant to calculate the mass of water that forms.
Solve From the balanced equation, we have the stoichiometric 
relations
2 mol H2 ] 1 mol O2 ] 2 mol H2O
Using the molar mass of each substance, we calculate the number 
of moles of each reactant:
 
Moles H2 = 1150 g H22a
1 mol H2
2.02 g H2
b = 74 mol H2  
 
Moles O2 = 11500 g O22a
1 mol O2
32.0 g O2
b = 47 mol O2
The coefficients in the balanced equation indicate that the reaction 
requires 2 mol of H2 for every 1 mol of O2. Therefore, for all the 
O2 to completely react, we would need 2 * 47 = 94 mol of H2. 
Since there are only 74 mol of H2, all of the O2 cannot react, so it is 
the excess reactant, and H2 must be the limiting reactant. (Notice 
that the limiting reactant is not necessarily the one present in the 
lowest amount.)
We use the given quantity of H2 (the limiting reactant) to calcu-
late the quantity of water formed. We could begin this calcula
