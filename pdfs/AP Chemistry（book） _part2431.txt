. When the concentrations of 
species in the reaction are altered, the equilibrium shifts until a new state of balance 
is attained. What does shift mean? It means that reactant and product concentrations 
change over time to accommodate the new situation. Shift does not mean that the equi-
librium constant itself is altered; the equilibrium constant remains the same. Le Châteli-
er’s principle states that the shift is in the direction that minimizes or reduces the effect 
of the change.
If a chemical system is already at equilibrium and the concentration of any substance 
in the mixture is increased (either reactant or product), the system reacts to consume 
some of that substance. Conversely, if the concentration of a substance is decreased, 
the system reacts to produce some of that substance.
There is no change in the equilibrium constant when we change the concentrations 
of reactants or products. As an example, consider our familiar equilibrium mixture of 
N2, H2, and NH3:
