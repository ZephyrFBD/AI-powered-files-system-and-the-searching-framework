tion due to gravity.
Pascal’s principle says that an external pressure applied to
a confined fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid.
Pressure is measured using a manometer or other type of
gauge. A barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure.
Standard atmospheric pressure (average at sea level) is
Gauge pressure is the total (absolute) pres-
sure minus atmospheric pressure.
Archimedes’ principle states that an object submerged
wholly or partially in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to
the weight of fluid it displaces (F
B = mFg = rFV

Fluid flow can be characterized either as streamline
(also called laminar), in which the layers of fluid move
smoothly and regularly along paths called streamlines, or as
turbulent, in which case the flow is not smooth and regular but
is characterized by irregularly shaped whirlpools.
Fluid flow rate is the mass or volume of fluid that passes a
given point per unit time. The equation
