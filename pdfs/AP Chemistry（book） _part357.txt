C COMPOUNDS (SECTION  2.9) Organic 
chemistry is the study of compounds that contain carbon. The sim-
plest class of organic molecules is the hydrocarbons, which contain 
only carbon and hydrogen. Hydrocarbons in which each carbon 
atom is attached to four other atoms are called alkanes. Alkanes have 
names that end in -ane, such as methane and ethane. Other organic 
compounds are formed when an H atom of a hydrocarbon is replaced 
with a functional group. An alcohol, for example, is a compound in 
which an H atom of a hydrocarbon is replaced by an OH functional 
group. Alcohols have names that end in -ol, such as methanol and 
ethanol. Compounds with the same molecular formula but different 
bonding arrangements of their constituent atoms are called isomers.
