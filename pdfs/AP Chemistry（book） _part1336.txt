 8.57 True or false: (a) The C ¬ C bonds in benzene are all the same 
length and correspond to typical single C ¬C bond lengths. 
(b) The C ¬ C bond in acetylene, HCCH, is longer than the 
average C ¬C bond length in benzene.
 [8.58] Mothballs are composed of naphthalene, C10H8, a mol-
ecule that consists of two six-membered rings of carbon 
fused along an edge, as shown in this incomplete Lewis 
structure:
 
 (a) Draw all of the resonance structures of naphthalene. 
How many are there? (b) Do you expect the C ¬ C bond 
lengths in the molecule to be similar to those of C ¬ C 
single bonds, C “C double bonds, or intermediate be-
tween C ¬C single and C “ C double bonds? (c) Not all 
of the C ¬C bond lengths in naphthalene are equivalent. 
Based on your resonance structures, how many C ¬ C 
bonds in the molecule do you expect to be shorter than 
the others?
