 two). If you were to calculate the oxidation state of carbon 
in these compounds, it would range from -4 in methane (if H’s are counted as +1) to +2 
in formic acid, which is consistent with carbon being oxidized. The ultimate oxidation 
product of any organic compound, then, is CO2, which is indeed the product of combus-
tion reactions of carbon-containing compounds (CO2 has 4 C ¬O bonds, and C has the 
oxidation state +4).
Aldehydes and ketones can be prepared by controlled oxidation of alcohols. Com-
plete oxidation results in formation of CO2 and H2O, as in the burning of methanol:
 
CH3OH1g2 + 3
2 O21g2 ¡ CO21g2 + 2 H2O1g2 
Controlled partial oxidation to form other organic substances, such as aldehydes and 
ketones, is carried out by using various oxidizing agents, such as air, hydrogen peroxide 
1H2O22, ozone 1O32, and potassium dichromate 1K2Cr2O72.
