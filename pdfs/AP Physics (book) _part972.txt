Because the stones are forced to squeeze against one another, they are mainly
under compression (see Fig. 9–29). A round arch consisting of many well-shaped
stones could span a very wide space. However, because the arch transfers 
horizontal as well as vertical forces to the supports, considerable buttressing on
the sides is needed, as we discuss shortly.
The pointed arch came into use about A.D. 1100 and became the hallmark of
the great Gothic cathedrals. It too was an important technical innovation, and was
first used to support heavy loads such as the tower and central arch of a cathedral.
Apparently the builders realized that, because of the steepness of the
