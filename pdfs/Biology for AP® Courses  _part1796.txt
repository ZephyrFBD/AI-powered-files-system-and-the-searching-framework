16.7 | Cancer and Gene Regulation
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
How can changes in gene expression cause cancer?
•
How can changes to gene expression at different levels disrupt the cell cycle?
Connection for AP® Courses
Cancer is a disease of altered gene expression that can occur at every level of control, including at the levels of DNA
methylation, histone acetylation, and activation of transcription factors. By understanding how each stage of gene regulation
works in normal cells, we can understand what goes wrong in diseased states. For example, changes in the activity of the
tumor suppressor gene p53 can result in cancer. Phosphorylation and other protein modifications have also been implicated
in cancer.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The learning objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transp
