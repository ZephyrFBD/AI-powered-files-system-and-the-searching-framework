We combine this sub model into our total model. According to the history of the 
Haiti, we search the data to determine the potential possibility and the original weight. 
For example, we use the days that people are suffering from the natural hazards in a 
year to determine the potential possibility of the natural hazard. Finally, we revise the 
data and abandon the strange data, so we gain 
0
C =[0.03 0.01 0.05],
0
w =[0.6 0.1 
0.8].Then we can use the data in our model and gain the result. 
4.3 What effect will cause if additional environmental factors occur? 
We just consider three major uncertain factors: natural hazards, development aid 
and government instability. Here we show our transformation data in natural hazards 
and regime coups.
