toward the Earth’s surface, 550 km away. When the
beam strikes Earth, its circular diameter is about 1500 m.
Find the rms electric field strength of the beam.
43. (III) A 1.60-m-long FM antenna is oriented parallel to the
electric field of an EM wave. How large must the electric
field be to produce a 1.00-mV (rms) voltage between the ends
of the antenna? What is the rate of energy transport per m2?
C = 810 pF.
1.8 mH.
22–6 Radiation Pressure
31. (II) Estimate the radiation pressure due to a bulb that emits
25 W of EM radiation at a distance of 9.5 cm from the center
of the bulb. Estimate the force exerted on your fingertip if
you place it at this point.
32. (II) What size should the solar panel on a satellite orbiting
Jupiter be if it is to collect the same amount of radiation
from the Sun as a
solar panel on a satellite orbiting
Earth? [Hint: Assume the inverse square law (Eq. 11–16b).]
33. (III) Suppose you have a car with a 100-hp engine. How large 
a solar panel would you need to r
