ound pushes forward on him—
Newton’s third law), and (2) the force 
exerted on the assistant by the sled,
pulling backward on him; see Fig. 4–13. If he pushes hard enough on the ground,
the force on him exerted by the ground,
will be larger than the sled pulling
back,
and the assistant accelerates forward (Newton’s second law). The sled,
on the other hand, accelerates forward when the force on it exerted by the assis-
tant is greater than the frictional force exerted backward on it by the ground (that
is, when 
has greater magnitude than 
in Fig. 4–12).
Using double subscripts to clarify Newton’s third law can become cumbersome,
and we won’t usually use them in this way. We will usually use a single subscript
referring to what exerts the force on the object being discussed. Nevertheless,
if there is any confusion in your mind about a given force, go ahead and use two
subscripts to identify on what object and by what object the force is exerted.
