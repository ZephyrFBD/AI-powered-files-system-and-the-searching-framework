he cell. The binding
of Na+
occurs on the inner surface of the cell
as its transportation remains unaffected by the
presence of ouabain.
c.
The binding of K+
occurs on the outer surface
of the cell and the binding of Na+
occurs on
the inner surface of the cell, as they are not
transported when ATP is absent.
d.
The binding of Na+
occurs on the outer
surface of the cell and the binding of K+
occurs on the inner surface of the cell, as they
are not transported when ATP is absent.

An experiment was set up to determine the movement of
molecules through a dialysis-tubing bag into water. A
dialysis-tubing bag containing 5% lactose and 5%
fructose was placed in a beaker of distilled water, as
illustrated. After four hours, fructose is detected in the
distilled water outside of the dialysis-tubing bag, but
lactose is not. What conclusions can be made about the
movement of molecules in this experiment?
a.
Fructose, being a monosaccharide, diffused
through the dialysis bag into the distilled
