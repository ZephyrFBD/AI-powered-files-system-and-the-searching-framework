imilar
nucleotide sequences because of convergence.
(B)
Photolyases appeared early during evolution in a common
ancestor; photolyase genes mutated and were repurposed in
descendants for circadian rhythm control and other blue
light responses.
(C)
Photolyases and cryptochromes have similar sequences; all
light receptor proteins have the same structure.
(D)
5. Throughout human history, there have been considerable eﬀorts
to use artificial selection to develop breeds of animals that are
useful in agriculture. For example, researchers have worked over
the last 50 years to develop dairy cows that produce as much milk
as possible. Which of the following best describes the
methodology behind these eﬀorts?
Researchers select for a single gene that enhances milk
production, resulting in homozygous herds of dairy cattle.
(A)
Researchers only breed cows with greater than average milk
production to increase production in future generations of
cows.
(B)
Researchers cross cows with dominant alleles
