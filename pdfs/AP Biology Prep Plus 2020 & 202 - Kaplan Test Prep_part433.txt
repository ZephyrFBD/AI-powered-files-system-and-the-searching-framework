D) is incorrect
because oxygen and NADPH are produced in noncyclic
photophosphorylation.

Lacking mitochondria, red blood cells predominantly produce energy
by anaerobic respiration. Thus, red blood cells produce ATP via
glycolysis followed by lactic acid fermentation, (D). (A) is incorrect
because aerobic cellular respiration occurs in mitochondria, which red
blood cells lack. (B) is incorrect because the products of anaerobic
fermentation are ATP and NAD+ (glycolysis produces ATP and NADH,
and fermentation regenerates NAD+). (C) is incorrect because human
red blood cells undergo lactic acid fermentation, not alcohol
fermentation.

By increasing the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane,
thermogenin uncouples the electron transport chain from oxidative
phosphorylation. Electrons are transferred to O2 to generate H2O, but
protons that have been pumped out of the mitochondrial matrix into
the intermembrane space return
