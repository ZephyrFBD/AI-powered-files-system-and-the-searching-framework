of a species that a habitat can
support. Most populations, however, don’t reach their carrying capacity because they’re exposed to limiting factors.
Same Equation, Different Look
On the AP Exam, you may see this formula expressed as dN/dt = B – D.
We’ve just translated the variables to make it easier to interpret. Make sure
that you are similarly prepared to parse any formula you’re given.
One important factor is population density. The factors that limit a population are either density-independent or
density-dependent. Density-independent factors affect the population, regardless of the density of the population.
Some examples are severe storms and extreme climates. On the other hand, density-dependent factors are those
with effects that depend on population density. Resource depletion, competition, and predation are all examples of
density-dependent factors. In fact, these effects become even more intense as the population density increases.
