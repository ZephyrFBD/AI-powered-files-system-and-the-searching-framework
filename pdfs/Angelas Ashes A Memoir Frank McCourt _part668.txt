d 
 
 Ireland is spread out before me, the Shannon shining its way to the 
 
 298 
 
 Atlantic. Dad told me this castle was built hundreds of years ago and if 
 
 you wait for the larks to stop their singing over there you can hear the 
 
 Normans below hammering and talking and getting ready for battle. 
 
 Once he brought me here in the dark so that we could hear Norman 
 
 and Irish voices down through the centuries and I heard them. I did. 
 
 Sometimes I’m up there alone on the heights of Carrigogunnell 
 
 and there are voices of Norman girls from olden times laughing and 
 
 singing in French and when I see them in my mind I’m tempted and I 
 
 climb to the very top of the castle where once there was a tower and 
 
 there in full view of Ireland I interfere with myself and spurt all over 
 
 Carrigogunnell and fields beyond. 
 
 That’s a sin I could never tell a priest. Climbing to great heights and 
 
  
  
 going at yourself before all of Ireland is surely worse than doing it
