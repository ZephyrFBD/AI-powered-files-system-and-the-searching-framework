on occurs.
d.
In new seedlings, histone methylations are
present; upon cold exposure, deacetylation
occurs.
31. A mutation within the promoter region can alter gene
transcription. Describe how this can happen.
a.
Mutated promoters decrease the rate of
transcription by altering the binding site for the
transcription factor.
b.
Mutated promoters increase the rate of
transcription by altering the binding site for the
transcription factor.
c.
Mutated promoters alter the binding site for
transcription factors to increase or decrease the
rate of transcription.
d.
Mutated promoters alter the binding site for
transcription factors and thereby cease
transcription of the adjacent gene.
32. What could happen if a cell had too much of an
activating transcription factor present?
a.
The transcription rate would increase, altering
cell function.
b.
The transcription rate would decrease, inhibiting
cell functions.
c.
The transcription rate decreases due to clogging
of the transcription factors.
d.
The
