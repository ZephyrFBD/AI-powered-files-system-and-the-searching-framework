Problem 71.
68. A basketball leaves a player’s hands at a height of 2.10 m
above the floor. The basket is 3.05 m above the floor. The
player likes to shoot the ball at a 38.0° angle. If the shot is
made from a horizontal distance of 11.00 m and must be
accurate to 
(horizontally), what is the range of
initial speeds allowed to make the basket?
69. A boat can travel 
in still water. (a) If the boat
points directly across a stream whose current is 
what is the velocity (magnitude and direction) of the boat
relative to the shore? (b) What will be the position of the
boat, relative to its point of origin, after 3.00 s?
70. A projectile is launched from ground level to the top of a
cliff which is 195 m away and 135 m high (see Fig. 3–56).
If the projectile lands on top of the cliff 6.6 s after it is
fired, find the initial velocity of the projectile (magnitude
and direction). Neglect air resistan
