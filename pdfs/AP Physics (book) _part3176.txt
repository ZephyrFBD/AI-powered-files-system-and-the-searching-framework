substances, atoms can be excited by photon absorption to energy levels called
metastable, which are states that last much longer because to jump down is a
“forbidden” transition (Section 28–6). Metastable states can last even a few
seconds or longer. In a collection of such atoms, many of the atoms will descend
to the lower state fairly soon, but many will remain in the excited state for over
an hour. Hence light will be emitted even after long periods. When you put a
luminous watch dial close to a bright lamp, many atoms are excited to metastable
states, and you can see the glow for a long time afterward.

A laser is a device that can produce a very narrow intense beam of monochromatic
coherent light. (By coherent, we mean that across any cross section of the beam, all
parts have the same phase.†) The emitted beam is a nearly perfect plane wave.
