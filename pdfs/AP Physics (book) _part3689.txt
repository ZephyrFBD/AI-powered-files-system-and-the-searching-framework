of energy decreases at the center and is no longer sufficient to prevent the huge
gravitational forces from once again causing the core to contract and heat up.
The hydrogen in the shell around the core then fuses even more fiercely because
of this rise in temperature, allowing the outer envelope of the star to expand and
to cool. The surface temperature, thus reduced, produces a spectrum of light that
peaks at longer wavelength (reddish).
This process marks a new step in the evolution of a star. The star has become
redder, it has grown in size, and it has become more luminous, which means it 
has left the main sequence. It will have moved to the right and upward on the 
107 years.

†The word “burn,” meaning fusion, is put in quotation marks because these high-temperature fusion
reactions occur via a nuclear process, and must not be confused
