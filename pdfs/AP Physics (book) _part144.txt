Distance a cyclist travels. How far can a cyclist travel in 
2.5 h along a straight road if her average velocity is 
APPROACH We want to find the distance traveled, so we solve Eq. 2–2 for 
SOLUTION In Eq. 2–2,
we multiply both sides by 
and obtain
¢x = v ¢t = (18 kmh)(2.5 h) = 45 km.
¢t
v = ¢x¢t,
¢x.
