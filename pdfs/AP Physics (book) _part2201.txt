particle moving in a plane perpendicular to a uniform
magnetic field is a circle as we shall now show. In Fig. 20–17 the magnetic field is
directed into the paper, as represented by :’s. An electron at point P is moving to
the right, and the force on it at this point is toward the bottom of the page as
shown (use the right-hand rule and reverse the direction for negative charge).
The electron is thus deflected toward the page bottom. A moment later, say,
when it reaches point Q, the force is still perpendicular to the velocity and is in
the direction shown. Because the force is always perpendicular to 
the mag-
nitude of 
does not change—the electron moves at constant speed. We saw in
Chapter 5 that if the force on a particle is always perpendicular to its velocity 
the particle moves in a circle and has a centripetal acceleration of magnitude
(Eq. 5–1). Thus a charged particle moves in a circular path with a
constant magnitude of centripetal acceleration in a uniform magnetic field (s
