 than using chloroplasts to synthesize food using light
energy, prokaryotes either  prepare food through
chemosynthesis or depend on other substances for nutrition.
(A)
Rather than hydrolyze foreign material in lysosomes,
prokaryotes use peroxisomes for detoxification.
(B)
Rather than synthesize ATP in mitochondria, specialized
molecules in the cell wall use an electron gradient to generate
ATP.
(C)
Rather than generate an mRNA transcript in the nucleus,
prokaryotic transcription of the bacterial chromosome occurs
in the cytosol.
(D)
