ied voltage 
if the resistance of the primary can be ignored (Kirchhoff’s
rules). We divide these two equations, assuming little or no flux is lost, to find
(21;6)
This transformer equation tells how the secondary (output) voltage is related to
the primary (input) voltage;
and 
in Eq. 21–6 can be the rms values 
(Section 18–7) for both, or peak values for both. Steady dc voltages don’t work
in a transformer because there would be no changing magnetic flux.
