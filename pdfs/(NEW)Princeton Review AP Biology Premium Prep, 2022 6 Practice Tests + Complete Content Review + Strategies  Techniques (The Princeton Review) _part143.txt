elements are combined in a fixed ratio, they form a chemical compound. You’ll
sometimes find that a compound has different properties from those of its elements. For instance, hydrogen and
oxygen exist in nature as gases. Yet when they combine to make water, they often pass into a liquid state. When
hydrogen atoms get together with oxygen atoms to form water, we’ve got a chemical reaction.
2H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2H2O (l)
The atoms of a compound are held together by chemical bonds, which may be ionic bonds, covalent bonds, or
hydrogen bonds.
An ionic bond is formed between two atoms when one or more electrons are transferred from one atom to the other.
In order for this to occur, first, one atom loses electrons and becomes positively charged, and the other atom gains
electrons and becomes negatively charged. The charged forms of the atoms are called ions. An ionic bond results
from the attraction between the two oppositely charged ions. For example, when Na reacts with Cl, the charged ions
