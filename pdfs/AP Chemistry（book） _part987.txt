ice Exercise 2
Which group of elements is characterized by an ns2np2 elec-
tron configuration in the outermost occupied shell?
(a) Based on its position in the periodic table, write the condensed electron configuration for bismuth, element 83. (b) How many 
unpaired electrons does a bismuth atom have?
Sample Exercise 6.9 
Electron Configurations from the Periodic Table
SOLUTION
(a)  Our first step is to write the noble-gas core. We do this by 
locating bismuth, element 83, in the periodic table. We then 
move backward to the nearest noble gas, which is Xe, element 
54. Thus, the noble-gas core is [Xe].
Next, we trace the path in order of increasing atomic numbers 
from Xe to Bi. Moving from Xe to Cs, element 55, we find ourselves 
in period 6 of the s block. Knowing the block and the period iden-
tifies the subshell in which we begin placing outer electrons, 6s. As 
we move through the s block, we add two electrons: 6s2.
