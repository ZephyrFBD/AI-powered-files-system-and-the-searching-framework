From the aesthetic or psychological point of view, too, architects must be 
aware of the forces involved in a structure—for example instability, even if only
illusory, can be discomforting to those who must live or work in the structure.
The list of ways in which physics relates to other fields is extensive. In the
Chapters that follow we will discuss many such applications as we carry out our
principal aim of explaining basic physics.
1–3 Models, Theories, and Laws
When scientists are trying to understand a particular set of phenomena, they often
make use of a model. A model, in the scientific sense, is a kind of analogy or
mental image of the phenomena in terms of something else we are already familiar
with. One example is the wave model of light. We cannot see waves of light as we
can water wav
