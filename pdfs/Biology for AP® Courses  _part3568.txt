han 1 mm in diameter. In simple
organisms, such as cnidarians and flatworms, every cell in the body is close to the external environment. Their cells
are kept moist and gases diffuse quickly via direct diffusion. Flatworms are small, literally flat worms, which ‘breathe’
through diffusion across the outer membrane (Figure 30.3). The flat shape of these organisms increases the surface area for
diffusion, ensuring that each cell within the body is close to the outer membrane surface and has access to oxygen. If the
flatworm had a cylindrical body, then the cells in the center would not be able to get oxygen.

Skin and Gills
Earthworms and amphibians use their skin (integument) as a respiratory organ. A dense network of capillaries lies just
below the skin and facilitates gas exchange between the external environment and the circulatory system. The respiratory
