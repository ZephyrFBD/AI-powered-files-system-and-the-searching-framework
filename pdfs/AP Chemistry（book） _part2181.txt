CHAPTER 14 Chemical Kinetics
We could equally well express the reaction rate in terms of the reactant, A. In this 
case, we would be describing the rate of disappearance of A, which we express as
 
Average rate of disappearance of A = - 
change in concentration of A
change in time

∆3A4
∆t  
[14.2]
Notice the minus sign in this equation, which we use to indicate that the concentra-
tion of A decreases.
By convention, rates are always expressed as positive quantities.
Because [A] decreases, ∆3A4 is a negative number. The minus sign we put in the equation 
converts the negative ∆3A4 to a positive rate of disappearance.
Because o
