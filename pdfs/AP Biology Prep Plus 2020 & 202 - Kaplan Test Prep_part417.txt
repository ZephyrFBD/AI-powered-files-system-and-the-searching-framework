 which
can be assumed to be O2, from the germinating seeds placed in water.
The eï¬€ect of increasing temperature on the rate of gas volume change (O2
utilization) is also measured during the lab. One of the problems with this
lab is that gas expands when it is heated. Sometimes the volume
increases so much it blows the dye out of the end of the respirometer
tube. You will also have the opportunity to ask your own questions and
conduct your own investigations about cellular respiration.
This experiment is an excellent example of using control specimens to
isolate experimental variables. Put quite simply, the dependent variable
being measured is the change in gas volume in the respirometer. The
hypothesis is that the change in gas volume is being caused by the
utilization of O2 by the germinating seeds. Other factors can contribute to
a change in gas volume (i.e., temperature and pressure), so these
variables need to be isolated from the variables you are interested in (i.e.,
the rate of
