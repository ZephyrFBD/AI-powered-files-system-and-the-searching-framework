Similarly,
Sometimes we need to do the reverse process: find the number N whose log
is, say, 2.670. This is called “taking the antilogarithm.” To do so, we separate our
number 2.670 into two parts, making the separation at the decimal point:
We now look at Table A–1 to see what number has its log equal to 0.670; none
does, so we must interpolate: we see that
and
So the number we want is between 4.6 and 4.7, and closer to the latter by 
Approximately we can say that
Thus
so
If the given logarithm is negative, say,
we proceed as follows:
so
Notice that we added to our given logarithm the next 
largest integer (3 in this case) so that we have an integer, plus a decimal number
between 0 and 1.0 whose antilogarithm can be looked up in the Table.

*
N = 6.6
= log 10–3 + log 6.6 = log 6.6 * 10–3,
 
log N =
–2.180 =
–3 + 0.820
–2.180,
102 = 468.
*
N = 4.68
= log A102B + log (4.68) = log A4.68 * 102B,
 
log N = 2 + 0.670
log 4.68 = 0.670.
