Lewis Carroll's book, Through the Looking-Glass.
All species co-evolve with other organisms; for example predators evolve with their prey, and parasites
evolve with their hosts. Each tiny advantage gained by favorable variation gives a species an edge over
close competitors, predators, parasites, or even prey. The only method that will allow a co-evolving species
to maintain its own share of the resources is to also continually improve its fitness. As one species gains
an advantage, this increases selection pressure on the other species; they must also develop an advantage
or they will be outcompeted. No single species progresses too far ahead because genetic variation among
the progeny of sexual reproduction provides all species with a mechanism to improve rapidly. Species that
cannot keep up become extinct. The Red Queen’s catchphrase was, “It takes all the running you can do to
stay in the same place.” This is an apt description of co-evo
