carbons.
The functional groups in a macromolecule are usually attached to the carbon backbone at one or more different places
along its chain and/or ring structure. Each of the four types of macromolecules—proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic
acids—has its own characteristic set of functional groups that contributes greatly to its differing chemical properties and its
function in living organisms.

A functional group can participate in specific chemical reactions. Some of the important functional groups in biological
molecules are shown in Figure 2.29; they include: hydroxyl, methyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, and sulfhydryl.
These groups play an important role in the formation of molecules like DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Functional
groups are usually classified as hydrophobic or hydrophilic depending on their charge or polarity characteristics. An
example of a hydrophobic group is the non-polar methyl mole
