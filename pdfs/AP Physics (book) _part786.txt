determine (a) the speeds of the two blocks after the collision,
and (b) how far back up the incline the smaller mass will go.

78. Two balls, of masses  
and  
are sus-
pended as shown in Fig. 7–46. The lighter ball is pulled away
to a 66° angle with the vertical and released. (a) What is
the velocity of the lighter ball before impact? (b) What is
the velocity of each ball after the elastic collision? (c) What
will be the maximum
height of each ball after
the elastic collision?

80. The space shuttle launches an 850-kg satellite by ejecting it
from the cargo bay. The ejection mechanism is activated
and is in contact with the satellite for 4.8 s to give it a velocity
of 
in the x direction relative to the shuttle. The mass
of the shuttle is 92,000 kg. (a) Determine the component of
velocity 
of the shuttle in the minus x direction resultin
