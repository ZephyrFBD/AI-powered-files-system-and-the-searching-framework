 9.31 Ammonia, NH3, reacts with incredibly strong bases to pro-
duce the amide ion, NH2
-. Ammonia can also react with ac-
ids to produce the ammonium ion, NH4
+. (a) Which species 
(amide ion, ammonia, or ammonium ion) has the largest 
 
H ¬ N ¬ H bond angle? (b) Which species has the smallest 
 
H ¬ N ¬ H bond angle?
 9.32  In which of the following AFn molecules or ions is there more 
than one F¬A ¬ F bond angle: SiF4, PF5, SF4, AsF3?
 9.33 (a) Explain why BrF4
- is square planar, whereas BF4
- is tetrahe-
dral. (b) How would you expect the H ¬ X¬ H bond angle to 
vary in the series H2O, H2S, H2Se? Explain. (Hint: The size of 
an electron pair domain depends in part on the electronega-
tivity of the
