CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
A hot-air balloon, open at one end (see photos above), rises when the air inside
is heated by a flame. For the following properties, is the air inside the balloon
higher, lower, or the same as for the air outside the balloon?
(i) Temperature.
(ii) Pressure.
(iii) Density.
T
his Chapter is the first of three (Chapters 13, 14, and 15) devoted to 
temperature, heat, and thermodynamics. Much of this Chapter discusses
the theory that matter is made up of atoms and that these atoms are in con-
tinuous random motion. This theory is called the kinetic theory. (“Kinetic,” you
may recall from Chapter 6, is Greek for “moving.”)
We also discuss the concept of temperature and how it is measured, as well as
the measured properties of gases which serve as a foundation for kinetic theory.
13–1 Atomic Theory of Matter
The idea that matter is made up of atoms dates back to the ancient Greeks.
