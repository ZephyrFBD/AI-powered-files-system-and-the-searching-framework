move with speed v relative to each other, as in Fig. E–1.
SOLUTION Let an object of length 
be at rest on the x axis in S. The coordi-
nates of its two end points are 
and 
so that 
At any instant
in 
the end points will be at 
and 
as given by the Lorentz transformation
equations. The length measured in 
is
An observer in 
measures
this length by measuring 
and 
at the same time (in the 
frame), so
Then, from the first of Eqs. E–3,
Since 
we have

which is Eq. 26–3a: the length contraction formula.
Time dilation. Derive the time dilation formula, Eq. 26–1,
from the Lorentz transformation equations.
APPROACH Again we compare measurements in two reference frames, S and 
that move with speed v relative to each other, Fig. E–1.
SOLUTION The time 
between two events that occur at the same place
in 
is measured to be 
Since 
then from the
last of Eqs. E–3, the time 
between the events as measured in S is
which is the time dilation formula, Eq. 26–1. Notice that we chose 
to be the
