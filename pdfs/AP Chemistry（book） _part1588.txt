ying the initial volume by a ratio of pressures 
and a ratio of temperatures. Intuitively, we expect decreasing 
pressure to cause the volume to increase, while decreasing the 
temperature should have the opposite effect. Because the change 
in pressure is more dramatic than the change in temperature, we 
expect the effect of the pressure change to predominate in deter-
mining the final volume, as it does.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
A gas occupies a volume of 0.75 L at 20 °C at 720 torr. What 
volume would the gas occupy at 41 °C and 760 torr?  
(a) 1.45 L (b) 0.85 L (c) 0.76 L (d) 0.66 L (e) 0.35 L
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
A 0.50-mol sample of oxygen gas is confined at 0 °C and  
1.0 atm in a cylinder with a movable piston. The piston 
compresses the gas so that the final volume is half the initial 
volume and the final pressure is 2.2 atm. What is the final 
temperature of the gas in degrees Celsius?
