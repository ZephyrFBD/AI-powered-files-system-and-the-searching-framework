tive site of an enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding to the
active site, so adding a competitive inhibitor would be an effective way to slow the rate of cell division in cells
containing the BCR-ABL kinase. Cofactors and coenzymes increase the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, so
choices (A) and (B) are incorrect. Transcription factors increase the rate of transcription of RNA from DNA, so
choice (D) is incorrect.
35. (D) Water moves from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water potential, and distilled water has
a higher water potential than the inside of a red blood cell (due to the solutes in the red blood cell). So water
would move into the red blood cell, and the cell would eventually burst. Choices (A) and (B) are incorrect
because red blood cells have a lower water potential than distilled water. Choice (C) is incorrect because water
moving into the red blood cells would cause them to swell and lyse, not shrivel.
36. (B) The presence of wildebeests has
