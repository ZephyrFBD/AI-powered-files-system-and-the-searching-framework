 which are differentially distributed across the membrane. Each
ion exerts an electrical influence and a concentration influence. Just as milk will eventually mix with coffee without the
need to stir, ions also distribute themselves evenly, if they are permitted to do so. In this case, they are not permitted to
return to an evenly mixed state.
The sodiumâ€“potassium ATPase uses cellular energy to move K+ ions inside the cell and Na+ ions outside. This alone
accumulates a small electrical charge, but a big concentration gradient. There is lots of K+ in the cell and lots of Na+ outside
the cell. Potassium is able to leave the cell through K+ channels that are open 90% of the time, and it does. However, Na+

channels are rarely open, so Na+ remains outside the cell. When K+ leaves the cell, obeying its concentration gradient, that
effectively leaves a negative charge b
