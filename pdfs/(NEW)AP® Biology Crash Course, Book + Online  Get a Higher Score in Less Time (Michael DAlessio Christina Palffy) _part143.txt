i.
Anaerobic prokaryotes emerged approximately 4 billion years ago and represent the first origins of
life.
ii. Earliest living organisms were unicellular, had a genetic code, and were able to evolve and
reproduce. The first organism is often known as LUCA, the last universal common ancestor.
iii. Ribosomes, a cell membrane, cytoplasm, and DNA are common to all forms of life. Prokaryotes
diverged into two types—bacteria and archaea—about 2.5 billion years ago.
iv. Oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere approximately 2.5 billion years ago as a result of
photosynthetic bacteria.
v. Eukaryotes emerged 2 billion years ago via the Endosymbiotic Theory.
vi. Until 500 million years ago, life was confined to aquatic environments. Plants eventually found a
foothold on earth (root system) via a symbiotic relationship with fungi.
vii. All living things come from a common ancestor.
C. Extinction and Adaptive Radiation
1. Extinction of a species is very common, and more than a dozen mass extinct
