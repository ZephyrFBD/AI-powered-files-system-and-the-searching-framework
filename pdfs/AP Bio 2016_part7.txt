 is the multiple-choice and grid-in portion of the exam. For the 
multiple-choice questions, the answer sheet has circles marked A–E for 
each question. For Biology, you will use only the circles marked A–D. You 
must complete the answer sheet using a No. 2 pencil only. Open your 
answer sheet to page 2. Mark all of your responses beginning on page 2 of 
your answer sheet, one response per question. No credit will be given for 
anything written in the exam booklet. Scratch paper is not allowed, but you 
may use the margins or any blank space in the exam booklet for scratch 
work. If you need to erase, do so carefully and completely. Your score on 
the multiple-choice section will be based solely on the number of questions 
answered correctly. Four-function calculators (with square root) are allowed.
For the grid-in questions, you will solve each problem, write your ﬁnal numeric 
answer in the boxes at the top of the grid, and ﬁll in the corresponding circles.
