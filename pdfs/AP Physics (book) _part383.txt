From the equation for box B above  
the tension in the cord is
Thus,
as we expect, since 
acts to accelerate only 
Alternate Solution to (a) We would have obtained the same result had we consid-
ered a single system, of mass
acted on by a net horizontal force equal
to 
(The tension forces 
would then be considered internal to the system as
a whole, and summed together would make zero contribution to the net force
on the whole system.)
NOTE It might be tempting to say that the force the person exerts,
acts not
only on box A but also on box B. It doesnâ€™t.
acts only on box A. It affects 
box B via the tension in the cord,
which acts on box B and accelerates it.
(You could look at it this way:
because 
accelerates both boxes
whereas 
only accelerates box B.)
