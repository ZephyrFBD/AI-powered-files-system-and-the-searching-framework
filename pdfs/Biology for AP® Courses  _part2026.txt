urvive and produce normal offspring.) Scientists have discovered more than half of all plant species
studied relate back to a species evolved through polyploidy. With such a high rate of polyploidy in plants, some scientists
hypothesize that this mechanism takes place more as an adaptation than as an error.
Activity
Create a visual representation such as a diagram with annotation to explain how island chains provide ideal
conditions for allopatric speciation and adaptive radiation to occur. Then design a plan for collecting data to
support the claim that speciation has occurred.
Think About It
•
Two species of fish had recently undergone sympatric speciation. The males of each species had a different
coloring through which the females could identify and choose a partner from her own species. After some time,
pollution made the lake so cloudy that it was hard for females to distinguish colors. What might take place in this
situation?

In a lake where most fish of a single species exhib
