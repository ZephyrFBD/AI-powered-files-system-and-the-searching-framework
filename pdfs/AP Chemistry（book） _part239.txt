ts the behavior of matter, while a(n) _________ provides 
 
an explanation for that behavior.
 1.67  A sample of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is synthesized in 
the laboratory. It contains 1.50 g of carbon and 2.00 g of 
oxygen. Another sample of ascorbic acid isolated from 
citrus fruits contains 6.35 g of carbon. According to the 
law of constant composition, how many grams of oxygen 
does it contain?
 1.68  Ethyl chloride is sold as a liquid (see photo) under pressure 
for use as a local skin anesthetic. Ethyl chloride boils at 12 °C 
at atmospheric pressure. When the liquid is sprayed onto 
the skin, it boils off, cooling and numbing the skin as it 
 
vaporizes. (a) What changes of state are involved in this use 
of ethyl chloride? (b) What is the boiling point of ethyl chlo-
ride in degrees Fahrenheit? (c) The bottle shown contains 
103.5 mL of ethyl chloride. The density of ethyl chloride at 
25 °C is 0.765 g>cm3. What is the mass of ethyl chloride in 
the bottle?
