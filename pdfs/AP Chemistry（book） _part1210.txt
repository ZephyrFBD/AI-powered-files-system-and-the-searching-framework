and n is the principal quantum number of the electron. Esti-
mate the Ô¨Årst ionization energy of Li. (c) Compare the result 
of your calculation with the value reported in Table 7.4 and 
explain the difference. (d) What value of the effective nuclear

One way to measure ionization energies is ultraviolet pho-
toelectron spectroscopy (PES), a technique based on the 
photoelectric effect. 
 (Section 6.2) In PES, monochro-
matic light is directed onto a sample, causing electrons to 
be emitted. The kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is 
measured. The difference between the energy of the photons 
and the kinetic energy of the electrons corresponds to the 
energy needed to remove the electrons (that is, the ioniza-
tion energy). Suppose that a PES experiment is performed 
in which m
