versus Determinism
The classical Newtonian view of the world is a deterministic one (see Section 5–8).
One of its basic ideas is that once the position and velocity of an object are
known at a particular time, its future position can be predicted if the forces on it
are known. For example, if a stone is thrown a number of times with the same
initial velocity and angle, and the forces on it remain the same, the path of the
projectile will always be the same. If the forces are known (gravity and air resis-
tance, if any), the stone’s path can be precisely predicted. This mechanistic view
implies that the future unfolding of the universe, assumed to be made up of
particulate objects, is completely determined.
This classical deterministic view of the physical world has been radically altered
by quantum mechanics. As we saw in the analysis of the double-slit experiment
(Section 28–2), electrons all treated in the same way will not all end up in the same
place. According to quantum mechanics
