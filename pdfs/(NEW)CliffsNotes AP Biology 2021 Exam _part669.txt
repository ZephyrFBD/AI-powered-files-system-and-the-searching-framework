cupy the same niche when resources are
limiting.
Gause mixed two species of Paramecium that competed for the same food. One population grew more rapidly,
apparently using resources more efficiently. Eventually, the second species was eliminated.
2. Resource partitioning. Some species coexist in spite of apparent competition for the same resources. Close
study, however, reveals that they occupy slightly different niches. By pursuing slightly different resources or
securing their resources in slightly different ways, individuals minimize competition and maximize success.
Dividing up the resources in this manner is called resource partitioning.
Five species of warblers coexist in spruce trees by feeding on insects in different regions of the tree and by using
different feeding behaviors to obtain the insects.
3. Realized niche. The niche that an organism occupies in the absence of competing species is its fundamental
niche. When competitors are present, however, one or both species may be
