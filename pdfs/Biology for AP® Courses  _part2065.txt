odels require the influence of cataclysmic
events which precipitate rapid adaptation and
speciation
d.
Both models conform to the rules of natural
selection and the influences of gene flow,
genetic drift, and mutation
41. Describe a situation where hybrid reproduction would
cause two species to continue divergence.
a.
f two closely related species continue to produce
hybrids, the hybrids will compete with both
species, causing them to find new niches which
will further their divergence
b.
If two closely related species continue to
produce hybrids, they will develop reproductive
barriers to prevent production of hybrids, to
ensure that they remain separate species.
c.
If two closely related species continue to
produce hybrids that are less fit than the parent
species, there would be reinforcement of
divergence.
d.
f two closely related species continue to produce
hybrids they will always converge into a single
species
