A cell is the smallest unit of a living thing. A living thing, whether made of one cell (like bacteria) or many cells (like a
human), is called an organism. Thus, cells are the basic building blocks of all organisms.
Several cells of one kind that interconnect with each other and perform a shared function form a tissue; several tissues
combine to form an organ (your stomach, heart, or brain), and several organs make up an organ system (such as the digestive
system, circulatory system, or nervous system). Several systems that function together form an organism (like a human
being). Here, we will examine the structure and function of cells.
There are many types of cells, all grouped into one of two broad categories: prokar
