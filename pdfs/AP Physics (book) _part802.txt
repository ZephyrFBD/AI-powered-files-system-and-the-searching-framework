h point or particle of a rotating object has, at any moment, a linear velocity v
and a linear acceleration a. We can now relate the linear quantities at each point,
v and a, to the angular quantities,
and 
for a rigid object rotating about a 
fixed axis. Consider a point P located a distance r from the axis of rotation, as in
Fig. 8–4. If the object rotates with angular velocity 
any point will have a linear
velocity whose direction is tangent to its circular path. The magnitude of that
point’s linear velocity is 
From Eq. 8–1b, a change in rotation 
angle 
(in radians) is related to the linear distance traveled by 
Hence
or (since 
) 
(8;4)
In this very useful Eq. 8–4, r is the distance of a point from the rotation axis 
and 
is given in rad/s. Thus, although 
is the same for every point in the rotating
object at any instant, the linear velocity v is greater for points farther from the 
axis (Fig. 8–5). Note that Eq. 8–4 is valid both instantaneously and on average.
