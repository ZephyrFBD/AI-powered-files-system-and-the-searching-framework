e thigh (femur), kneecap (patella), leg (tibia and fibula), ankle (tarsals), and
foot (metatarsals and phalanges) bones.
The femur, or thighbone, is the longest, heaviest, and strongest bone in the body. The femur and pelvis form the hip joint at
the proximal end. At the distal end, the femur, tibia, and patella form the knee joint. The patella, or kneecap, is a triangular
bone that lies anterior to the knee joint. The patella is embedded in the tendon of the femoral extensors (quadriceps). It
improves knee extension by reducing friction. The tibia, or shinbone, is a large bone of the leg that is located directly below
the knee. The tibia articulates with the femur at its proximal end, with the fibula and the tarsal bones at its distal end. It is
the second largest bone in the human body and is responsible for transmitting the weight of the body from the femur to the
foot. The fibula, or calf bone, parallels and articulates with the tibia. It does not articulate with the femur and does
