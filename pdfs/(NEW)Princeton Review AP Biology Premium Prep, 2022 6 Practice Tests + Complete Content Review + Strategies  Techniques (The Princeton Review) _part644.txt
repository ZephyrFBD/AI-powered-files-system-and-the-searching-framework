ght. This corresponds
to a pH of 7 rather than 4 and a watering volume of 80 mL rather than 40 mL.

D
Choices (A), (B), and (C) would all give interesting information about the experiment, but the only one
that would make the results more statistically significant is to increase the number of plants in each group.
Two plants is not enough to be sure about the results of the experiment.

D
Photoperiodism is a response of plants to the changing length of day or night. It is a way that plants
respond to a signal from the environment. Animal circadian rhythms are also a response to the
environment, (D). Viral infection, (A), increased appetite, (B), and meiotic division, (C), are not
responses to the environment.

B
The gross primary productivity is the total amount of energy stored, but the plant has energy needs of its
own that are fulfilled with cellular respiration. Choice (A) is true but not relevant to this question. Choice
(C) is not true. Heterotrophs must get energy from
