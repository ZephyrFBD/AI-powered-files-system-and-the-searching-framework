 are the worldâ€™s major sources of energy, are 
known as fossil fuels. All have formed over millions of years from the decomposition of 
plants and animals and are being depleted far more rapidly than they are being formed.
Natural gas consists of gaseous hydrocarbons, compounds of hydrogen and carbon. It 
contains primarily methane 1CH42, with small amounts of ethane 1C2H62, propane 1C3H82, 
and butane 1C4H102. We determined the fuel value of propane in Sample Exercise 5.10. 
 
 
Sample Exercise 5.14 
Estimating the Fuel Value of a Food from Its Composition
(a) A 28-g (1-oz) serving of a popular breakfast cereal served with 120 mL of skim milk provides 8 g protein, 26 g carbohydrates, 
and 2 g fat. Using the average fuel values of these substances, estimate the fuel value (caloric content) of this serving.  
(b) A person of average weight uses about 100 Cal>mi when running or jogging. How many servings of this cereal provide  
the fuel value requirements to run 3 mi?
