d has the lowest frequency of visible light. The
greater the frequency shift, the greater the velocity of recession. It is found that
the farther the galaxies are from us, the faster they move away. This observation
is the basis for the idea that the universe is expanding, and is one basis for the idea
that the universe had a beginning affectionately called the “Big Bang”(Chapter 33).
12–8 Shock Waves and the Sonic Boom
An object such as an airplane traveling faster than the speed of sound is said to
have a supersonic speed. Such a speed is often given as a Mach† number, which is
defined as the ratio of the speed of the object to the speed of sound in the sur-
rounding medium. For example, a plane traveling 
high in the atmosphere,
where the speed of sound is only 
has a speed of Mach 2.
