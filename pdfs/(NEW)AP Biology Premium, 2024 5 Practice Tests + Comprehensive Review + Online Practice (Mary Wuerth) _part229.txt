isms require the input of energy, so the cell would eventually die.
12. (a) The enzyme ATP synthase is found on the infoldings of the cell membrane in prokaryotes because the
enzyme needs a proton gradient to function.
(b) ATP synthase uses a proton gradient to drive the synthesis of ATP through chemiosmosis. To create a
proton gradient, there must be a way to separate the protons. In eukaryotes, this separation occurs on either
side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Since prokaryotes do not have mitochondria, they separate
protons across the only membrane they have, the cell membrane. So that is where ATP synthase is located
in prokaryotes.
(c) If ATP synthase was found in the cytosol of the cell, there would be no way to separate the protons and
create a proton gradient in the cytosol. So ATP synthase could not function.
(d) The mitochondria contain outer membranes and inner membranes. The electron transport chain is located on
the inner membrane, and it pumps protons into the int
