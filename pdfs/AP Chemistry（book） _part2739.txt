eal indicator because it 
changes color from pH 8.3 to 10.0, close to the pH at 
the equivalence point. Methyl red is a poor choice, 
however, because its color change, from 4.2 to 6.0, 
begins well before the equivalence point is reached.
Titration of a weak base (such as 0.100 M NH3) with a strong acid solution (such 
as 0.100 M HCl) leads to the titration curve shown in Figure 17.14. In this example, the 
equivalence point occurs at pH 5.28. Thus, methyl red is an ideal indicator, but phenol-
phthalein would be a poor choice.

with a strong base? Explain your answer.
