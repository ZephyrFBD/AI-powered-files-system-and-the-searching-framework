sis pathway exists in almost
all organisms. Glycolysis exists among Bacteria, Archaea, and
Eukarya and is catalyzed by homologous enzymes in all three
domains. Which of the following hypotheses is supported by this
finding?
Glycolysis is an ineﬀicient process to produce ATP in all
extant organisms.
(A)
Glycolysis is a primitive process that appeared in a common
ancestor of all present-day organisms.
(B)
Glycolysis is present in many diﬀerent organisms because it
has appeared several times during evolution.
(C)
Glycolysis appeared only aȇer organisms developed
mitochondria to support metabolism.
(D)
3. A small flock of finches was blown over from the mainland onto a
neighboring island. On the mainland, a small beak is the most
abundant trait, but a large proportion of birds that landed on the
island happened to have large beaks. On the island, many types of
seeds are available, giving birds of all beak sizes the same
opportunity for feeding. Many years later, ecologists survey the
