cells. Lymphocytes are the primary cells of the immune system and include B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells. B
cells destroy bacteria and inactivate their toxins. They also produce antibodies. T cells attack viruses, fungi, some bacteria,
transplanted cells, and cancer cells. T cells attack viruses by releasing toxins that kill the viruses. Natural killer cells attack
a variety of infectious microbes and certain tumor cells.
One reason that HIV poses significant management challenges is because the virus directly targets T cells by gaining entry
through a receptor. Once inside the cell, HIV then multiplies using the T cellâ€™s own genetic machinery. After the HIV virus
replicates, it is transmitted directly from the infected T cell to macrophages. The presence of HIV can remain unrecognized
for an extensive period of time before full disease symptoms develop.
