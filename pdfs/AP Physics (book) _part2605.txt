rear that are smaller than they would be if the mirror were
flat. Are the mirrors concave or convex? What is a mirror’s
radius of curvature if cars 16.0 m away appear 0.33 their
normal size?
19. (II) When walking toward a concave mirror you notice that
the image flips at a distance of 0.50 m. What is the radius 
of curvature of the mirror?
20. (II) (a) Where should an object be placed in front of a
concave mirror so that it produces an image at the same
location as the object? (b) Is the image real or virtual?
(c) Is the image inverted or upright? (d) What is the mag-
nification of the image?

21. (II) A shaving or makeup mirror is designed to magnify your
face by a factor of 1.40 when your face is placed 20.0 cm in
front of it. (a) What type of mirror is it? (b) Describe the
type of image that it makes of your face. (c) Calculate the
required radius of curvature for the mirror.
22. (II) Use two techniques, (a) a ray diagram, and (b) the mirror
equation, to show that the
