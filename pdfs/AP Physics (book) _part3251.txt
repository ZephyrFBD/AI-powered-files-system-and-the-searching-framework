 we can then calculate the moment of inertia, I, from
Eq. 29–2. The moment of inertia is related to the CO separation (bond length r).
SOLUTION (a) The photon energy,
equals the rotational
energy level difference,
From Eq. 29–2, we can write
With
(the upper state) in this case, we solve for I:
(b) The molecule rotates about its center of mass (
) as shown in Fig. 29–15.
Let 
be the mass of the C atom,
and let 
be the mass of the O,
The distance of the 
from the C atom, which is 
in Fig. 29–15, is
given by the 
formula, Eq. 7–9:
The O atom is a distance
from the
