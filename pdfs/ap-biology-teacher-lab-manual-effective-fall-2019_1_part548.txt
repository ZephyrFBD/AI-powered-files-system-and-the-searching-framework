nsformation procedure involves 
the following three main steps to introduce the plasmid DNA into the E. coli cells and to 
provide an environment for the cells to express their newly acquired genes: 
1. Adding CaCl2 
2. “Heat shocking” the cells 
3.  Incubating the cells in nutrient broth for a short time before   
plating them on agar
