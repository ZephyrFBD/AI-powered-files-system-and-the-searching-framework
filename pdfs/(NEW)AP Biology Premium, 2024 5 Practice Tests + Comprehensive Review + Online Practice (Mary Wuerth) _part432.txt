stence of fossils from organisms that no longer live on Earth also provide evidence of
evolution. Transitional fossils show intermediate states between ancestral and modern species. Fossils can be
dated by studying the age of the rock layers in which they are found or by using radioactive isotopes to date the
fossils.
Vestigial structures—Some organisms contain anatomical features that no longer seem to have a purpose in
the modern organism but may have had a function in an ancestral organism. An example of this in humans is
the tailbone, which currently serves no function in humans but may have helped our tree-dwelling ancestors
balance upon or travel between branches.
Convergent evolution—Species that live in similar environments may evolve similar adaptations even though
they may not have a recent common ancestor. Sharks (cartilaginous fish) and dolphins (mammals) do not share
a recent common ancestor, but they have evolved similar body shapes due to their similar environments.
