Which of the following elements, if doped into silicon, would yield an n-type semiconductor: Ga, As, or C?
Sample Exercise 12.4 
Identifying Types of Semiconductors
SOLUTION
Analyze An n-type semiconductor means that the dopant atoms 
must have more valence electrons than the host material. Silicon 
is the host material in this case.
Plan We must look at the periodic table and determine the num-
ber of valence electrons associated with Si, Ga, As, and C. The ele-
ments with more valence electrons than silicon are the ones that 
will produce an n-type material upon doping.
Solve Si is in column 4A, and so has four valence electrons. Ga is 
in column 3A, and so has three valence electrons. As is in column 
5A, and so has five valence electrons;
