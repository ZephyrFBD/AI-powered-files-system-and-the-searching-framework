 does 
this modification relate to Figure 9.43? (d) Would you ex-
pect the p
2p MOs of CO to have equal atomic orbital contri-
butions from the C and O atoms? If not, which atom would 
have the greater contribution?

The energy-level diagram in Figure 9.36 shows that the 
 
sideways overlap of a pair of p orbitals produces two molecular 
orbitals, one bonding and one antibonding. In ethylene there 
is a pair of electrons in the bonding π orbital between the two 
carbons. Absorption of a photon of the appropriate wave-
length can result in promotion of one of the bonding elec-
trons from the p
2p to the p*
2p molecular orbital. (a) Assuming 
this electronic transition corresponds to the HOMO-LUMO 
transition, what is the HOMO in ethylene? (b) Assuming this 
electronic transition corresponds to the HOMO-LUMO tran-
sition, what is the LUMO in ethylene? (c) Is the C ¬ C bond 
in ethylene stronger or weaker in the excited state than in the 
ground state? Why? (d) Is the C¬ C bond in
