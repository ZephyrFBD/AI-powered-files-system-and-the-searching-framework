is found from
SOLUTION (a) The spring stretches 0.150 m due to the 0.300-kg load, so
(b) The spring is now horizontal (on a table). It is stretched 0.100 m from
equilibrium and is given no initial speed, so
(c) The maximum velocity 
is attained as the mass passes through the 
equilibrium point where all the energy is kinetic. By comparing the total energy
(see Eq. 11–3) at equilibrium with that at full extension, conservation of energy
tells us that
where
Solving for 
(or using Eq. 11–5a), we have
(d) We use conservation of energy, or Eq. 11–5b derived from it, and find that
(e) By Newton’s second law,
So the maximum acceleration occurs
where the force is greatest—that is, when 
Thus
NOTE We cannot use the kinematic equations, Eqs. 2–11, because the accelera-
tion is not constant in SHM.
Energy calculations. For the simple harmonic oscillator 
of Example 11–4, determine (a) the total energy, and (b) the kinetic and poten-
tial energies at half amplitude
APPROACH We use conservation of
