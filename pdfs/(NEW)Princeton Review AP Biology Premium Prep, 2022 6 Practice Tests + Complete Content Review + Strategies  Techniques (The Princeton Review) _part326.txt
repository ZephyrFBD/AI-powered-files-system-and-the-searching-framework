DNA: THE BLUEPRINT OF LIFE
All living things possess an astonishing degree of organization. From the simplest single-celled organism to the
largest mammal, millions of reactions and events must be coordinated precisely for life to exist. This coordination is
directed by DNA, which is the hereditary blueprint of the cell.
THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF DNA
DNA is made up of repeated subunits of nucleotides. Each nucleotide has a five-carbon sugar, a phosphate, and a
nitrogenous base. Take a look at the nucleotide below.
The name of the pentagon-shaped sugar in DNA is deoxyribose. Hence, the name deoxyribonucleic acid. Notice
that the sugar is linked to two things: a phosphate and a nitrogenous base. A nucleotide can have one of four
different nitrogenous bases:
adenine—a purine (double-ringed nitrogenous base)
guanine—a purine (double-ringed nitrogenous base)
cytosine—a pyrimidine (single-ringed nitrogenous base)
thymine—a pyrimidine (single-ringed
