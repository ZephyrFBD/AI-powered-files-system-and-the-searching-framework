three possible values of ml: 1, 0, -1). There are five 4d orbitals 
(when l = 2, there are five allowed values of ml: 2, 1, 0, -1, -2). 
There are seven 4f  
orbitals (when l = 3, there are seven permitted 
values of ml: 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3).

6.6 ∣ Representations of Orbitals
So far we have emphasized orbital energies, but the wave function also provides infor-
mation about an electron’s probable location in space. Let’s examine the ways in which 
we can picture orbitals, because their shapes help us visualize how the electron density is 
distributed around the nucleus.
The s Orbitals
We have already seen one representation of the lowest-energy orbital of the hydrogen 
atom, the 1s (Figure 6.17). The first thing we notice about the electron density for the 1s 
orbital is that it is spherically symmetric—in other words, the electron density at a given
