 and adult stem cells. It is not active in adult somatic cells. For her discovery
of telomerase and its action, Elizabeth Blackburn (Figure 14.16) received the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in
2009.

Telomerase and Aging
Cells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened because most somatic cells do not make
telomerase. This essentially means that telomere shortening is associated with aging. With the advent of modern medicine,
preventative health care, and healthier lifestyles, the human life span has increased, and there is an increasing demand for
people to look younger and have a better quality of life as they grow older.
In 2010, scientists found that telomerase can reverse some age-related conditions in mice. This may have potential in
regenerative medicine.
