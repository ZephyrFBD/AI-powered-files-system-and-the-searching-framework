76. A conveyor belt is used to send burgers through a grill-
ing machine. If the grilling machine is 1.2 m long and 
the burgers require 2.8 min to cook, how fast must 
the conveyor belt travel? If the burgers are spaced 25 cm
apart, what is the rate of burger production (in burgers/min)?
77. Two students are asked to find the height of a particular
building using a barometer. Instead of using the barometer
as an altitude measuring device, they take it to the roof of the
building and drop it off, timing its fall. One student reports a
fall time of 2.0 s, and the other, 2.3 s. What % difference does
the 0.3 s make for the estimates of the building’s height?
78. Figure 2–50 shows the position vs. time graph for two bicy-
cles, A and B. (a) Identify any instant at which the two
bicycles have the same velocity. (b) Which bicycle has the
larger acceleration? (c) At which instant(s) are the bicycles
passing each other? Which bicycle is passing the other?
(d) Which bicycle has
