 species and their
commonness. Biodiversity can be estimated at a number of levels of organization of living things. These estimation
indexes, which came from information theory, are most useful as a first step in quantifying biodiversity between and within
ecosystems; they are less useful when the main concern among conservation biologists is simply the loss of biodiversity.
However, biologists recognize that measures of biodiversity, in terms of species diversity, may help focus efforts to preserve
the biologically or technologically important elements of biodiversity.
The Lake Victoria cichlids provide an example through which we can begin to understand biodiversity. The biologists
studying cichlids in the 1980s discovered hundreds of cichlid species representing a variety of specializations to particular
habitat types and specific feeding strategies: eating plankton floating in the water, scraping and then eating algae from
rocks, eating insect larvae from the bottom, and eating th
