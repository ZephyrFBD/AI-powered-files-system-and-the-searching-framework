to a sling of length
1.5 m and begins whirling the rock in a nearly horizontal
circle, accelerating it from rest to a rate of 75 rpm after
5.0 s. What is the torque required to achieve this feat, and
where does the torque come from?
81. Bicycle gears: (a) How is the angular velocity 
of the
rear wheel of a bicycle related to the angular velocity 
of the front sprocket and pedals? Let 
and 
be the
number of teeth on the front and rear sprockets, respec-
tively, Fig. 8â€“58. The teeth are spaced the same on both
sprockets and the rear sprocket is firmly attached to the
rear wheel. (b) Evaluate the ratio 
when the front
and rear sprockets have 52 and 13 teeth, respectively, and
(c) when they have 42 and 28 teeth.

mass 0.050 kg and diameter 0.075 m, joined by a (concen-
tric) thin solid cylindrical hub of mass 0.0050 kg and
diameter 0.013 m. Use conservation of energy to calculate
the linear speed of the yo-y
