 because the light phase supplies the NADPH energy for the dark phases and if the light phases
were active as measured by oxygen production, then the NADPH must have been made too so as long as there is carbon
dioxide, then the dark phases should be active.
Question 4
a. Soil moisture and temperature are important for plant survival. Explain how plants react to environmental
stimuli to maintain homeostasis.
Plants can maintain homeostasis by changing their behavior in response to environmental stimuli. Sunflowers can
turn to follow the Sun as it moves across the sky. This allows them to get the maximum amount of sunlight throughout
the day. It can also help them regulate temperature. Plants can also regulate their water by changing their behavior.
Plants have large vacuoles that they store water in. If they are not getting much rain, then they can take out the water
from their vacuoles to use it. Plants also have roots that they can grow and stretch in different directions. They also
