g down its concentration gradient.
Resting Membrane Potential
The sodium-potassium pump is important for setting up the typical charge
within the cell, and the inside is always a little bit negative. This resting
membrane potential (difference in charge between inside and outside the cell)
is important for passing signals in the body.
We’ve now seen that small substances can cross the cell membrane by:
simple diffusion
facilitated transport
active transport
Endocytosis
When the particles that want to enter a cell are just too large, the cell uses a portion of the cell membrane to engulf
the substance. The cell membrane forms a pocket, pinches in, and eventually forms either a vacuole or a vesicle.
This process is called endocytosis.
Three types of endocytosis exist: pinocytosis, phagocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis. In pinocytosis,
the cell ingests liquids (“cell-drinking”). In phagocytosis, the cell takes in solids (“cell-eating”). A special type of
endocytosis, receptor-me
