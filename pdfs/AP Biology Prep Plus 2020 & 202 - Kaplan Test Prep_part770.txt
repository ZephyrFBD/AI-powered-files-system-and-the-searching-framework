Fruit flies distribute randomly in the bottles because flies
have a poor sense of smell.
(A)
Flies gather away from the cotton tip because the smell acts
as a negative chemotactic stimulus.
(B)
Although there are more flies in the chamber with the banana
stimulus, a chi-square analysis would show that the
movement is random.

Fruit flies gather in the chamber with the banana cotton tip
because the smell acts as a positive chemotactic stimulus.

Innate versus Learned Behavior
Ethology is the study of behavior—the way organisms act. Behaviors in
organisms are triggered by internal and external stimuli, such as hunger
and danger. Natural selection favors behaviors that promote
reproduction and survival. Two types of behavior are innate and learned.
Innate behaviors are responses encoded in the genes of organisms,
meaning organisms are genetically programmed how to respond to
particular stimuli.
