change 
can happen only if 3NH34 decreases and 3N24 and 3H24 increase. Thus, the reaction pro-
ceeds toward equilibrium by forming N2 and H2 from NH3; that is, the reaction as written 
in Equation 15.6 proceeds from right to left.
This approach can be formalized by defining a quantity called the reaction quotient.
The reaction quotient, Q, is a number obtained by substituting reactant  
and product concentrations or partial pressures at any point during a reaction  
into an equilibrium-constant expression.
Therefore, for the general reaction
a A + b B âˆ† d D + e E
the reaction quotient in terms of molar concentrations is
 
Q c =
3D4d3E4e
3A4a3B4b 
[15.24]
A related quantity Q p can be written for any reaction that involves gases by using partial 
pressures instead of concentrations.
Although we use what looks like the equilibrium-constant expression to calculate 
the reaction quotient, the concentrations we use may or may not be the equilibrium 
concentrations. For example, when we subs
