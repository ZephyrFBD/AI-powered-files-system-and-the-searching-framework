ties is ultimately lost as heat.
Heat is energy that cannot be harnessed by organisms to do work and thus represents energy lost from the
ecosystem. Ultimately, all energy originally gained through NPP is lost as heat. Thus, in contrast to nutrients and
other forms of matter (discussed later in this chapter), heat cannot be recycled. Remember: Energy flows, matter
recycles.
Because ecological efficiency is so low, nearly all domestic animals used for food or work are herbivores. If a
carnivore were raised for food or work, the energy required to raise and sustain it would far exceed its value in food
or work. The meat consumed by the carnivore would yield a greater return by merely using it directly for human
food.
Species Diversity and Trophic Interactions
Certain species in a community can heavily influence the dynamics of that community:
1. The dominant species is the most abundant species or the species that contributes the greatest biomass to a
community. A species becomes dominan
