of radiation is the subject of
dosimetry. The curie (Ci) and the becquerel (Bq) are units 
that measure the source activity or rate of decay of a sample:
decays per second, whereas 
The absorbed dose, often specified in rads, measures the amount
of energy deposited per unit mass of absorbing material: 1 rad
is the amount of radiation that deposits energy at the rate of
of material. The SI unit of absorbed dose is the gray:
The effective dose is often specified
by the 
where RBE is the “relative bio-
logical effectiveness” of a given type of radiation; 1 rem of any
type of radiation does approximately the same amount of
biological damage. The average dose received per person per
year in the United States is about 360 mrem. The SI unit for
effective dose is the sievert:
[*Nuclear radiation is used in medicine for cancer therapy,
and for imaging of biological structure and processes.
Tomographic imaging of the human body, which can provide 
3-dimensional detail, includes several types: PE
