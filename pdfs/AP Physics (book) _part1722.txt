et charge, contain equal numbers of protons and electrons. Sometimes
an atom may lose one or more of its electrons, or may gain extra electrons, in which
case it will have a net positive or negative charge and is called an ion.
In solid materials the nuclei tend to remain close to fixed positions, whereas
some of the electrons may move quite freely. When an object is neutral, it contains
equal amounts of positive and negative charge. The charging of a solid object by
rubbing can be explained by the transfer of electrons from one object to the other.
When a plastic ruler becomes negatively charged by rubbing with a paper towel,
electrons are transferred from the towel to the plastic, leaving the towel with a 
positive charge equal in magnitude to the negative charge acquired by the plastic.
In liquids and gases, nuclei or ions can move as well as electrons.
Normally when objects are charged by rubbing, they hold their charge only
for a limited time and eventually return to the neutral s
