Essential Knowledge
3.C.2: Biological systems have multiple processes that 
increase genetic variation.
Science Practice
6.2: The student can construct explanations of phenomena 
based on evidence produced through scientific practices.
Learning Objective 
3.28: The student is able to construct an explanation of  
the multiple processes that increase variation within  
a population.
(A)
This option is incorrect. Plate I shows an extensive growth of bacteria, which is

(B)
This option is incorrect. Plate III shows E. coli and the ampicillin-resistant plasmid 
growing extensively whe
