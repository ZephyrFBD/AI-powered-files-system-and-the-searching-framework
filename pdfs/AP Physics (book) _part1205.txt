The angle of incidence is defined as the angle 
the incident ray makes with 
the perpendicular to the reflecting surface (or the wave front makes with the sur-
face). The angle of reflection is the corresponding angle 
for the reflected wave.

1 Interference;
Principle of Superposition
Interference refers to what happens when two waves pass through the same region
of space at the same time. Consider, for example, the two wave pulses on a cord
traveling toward each other as shown in Fig. 11–37 (time increases downward in
both a and b). In Fig. 11–37a the two pulses have the same amplitude, but one is
a crest and the other a trough; in Fig. 11–37b they are both crests. In both cases,
the waves meet and pass right by each other. However, in the region where they
overlap, the resultant displacement is the algebraic sum of their separate displace-
ments (a crest is considered positive and a trough negative). This is the principle of
superposition. In Fig. 11–37a, the two waves h
