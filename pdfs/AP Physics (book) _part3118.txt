For material particles such as electrons, quantum mechanics relates the 
wavelength to momentum according to de Broglie’s formula,
Eq. 27–8.
But what corresponds to the amplitude or displacement of a matter wave? The ampli-
tude of an electromagnetic wave is represented by the electric and magnetic fields,
E and B. In quantum mechanics, this role is played by the wave function, which 
is given the symbol 
(the Greek capital letter psi, pronounced “sigh”). Thus 
represents the wave displacement, as a function of time and position, of a new
kind of field which we might call a “matter” field or a matter wave.
To understand how to interpret the wave function 
we make an analogy
with light using the wave–particle duality.
We saw in Chapter 11 that the intensity I of any wave is proportional to the
square of the amplitude. This holds true for light waves as well, as we saw i
