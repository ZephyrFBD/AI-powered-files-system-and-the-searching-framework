Plants regulate or inhibit the formation of nodules on their roots by a
chemical pathway that involves cytokinins, which are produced in the
leaves and sent down to the roots; therefore, (A) and (B) are incorrect. In
this experiment, the cytokinins played a role in inhibiting new nodule
formation when the plants were grown in nitrogen-rich soil. The plant did
not have a need for more nodules to be formed since it was able to obtain
nitrogen from the nitrogen-rich soil. (C) is incorrect and (D) is correct.

In the first and second generations, there are two alleles for tail length, T,
and t. By the third generation, only one of the alleles for tail length, T,
remains and has become fixed, while t, the allele for short tails has been
lost. The
