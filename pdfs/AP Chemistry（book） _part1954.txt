 low- 
dimensional form of carbon to be experimentally isolated and studied. Although its 
properties had been the subject of theoretical predictions for over 60 years, it was not 
until 2004 that researchers at the University of Manchester in England isolated and 
identified individual sheets of carbon atoms with the honeycomb structure shown in 
Figure 12.51. Amazingly, the technique they used to isolate single-layer graphene was to 
successively peel away thin layers of graphite using adhesive tape. Individual layers of 
graphene were then transferred to a silicon wafer having a precisely defined overcoat of 
SiO2. When a single layer of graphene is left on the wafer, an interference-like contrast 
pattern results that can be seen with an optical microscope. If not for this simple yet 
effective way to scan for individual graphene crystals, they would probably still remain 
undiscovered. Subsequently, it has been shown that graphene can be deposited on clean 
surfaces of other types
