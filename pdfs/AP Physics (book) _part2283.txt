64. Two long straight parallel wires are 15 cm apart. Wire A
carries 2.0-A current. Wire B’s current is 4.0 A in the same
direction. (a) Determine the magnetic field magnitude due
to wire A at the position of wire B. (b) Determine the mag-
netic field due to wire B at the position of wire A. (c) Are
these two magnetic fields equal and opposite? Why or 
why not? (d) Determine the force on wire A due to wire B,
and the force on wire B due to wire A. Are these two forces
equal and opposite? Why or why not?
65. Protons with momentum 
are magnet-
ically steered clockwise in a circular path 2.2 m in diameter.
Determine the magnitude and direction of the field in the
magnets surrounding the beam pipe.
66. A small but rigid 
wire carrying a 5.0-A current
(Fig. 20–62) is placed inside a solenoid. The solenoid is
15.0 cm long and has 700 loops of wire, and
