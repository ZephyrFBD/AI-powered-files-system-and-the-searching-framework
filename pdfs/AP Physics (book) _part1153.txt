Spring calculations. A spring stretches 0.150 m when a
0.300-kg mass is gently suspended from it as in Fig. 11–3b. The spring is then set
up horizontally with the 0.300-kg mass resting on a frictionless table as in Fig. 11–5.
The mass is pulled so that the spring is stretched 0.100 m from the equilibrium
point, and released from rest. Determine: (a) the spring stiffness constant k;
(b) the amplitude of the horizontal oscillation A; (c) the magnitude of the
maximum velocity 
(d) the magnitude of the velocity v when the mass is
0.050 m from equilibrium; and (e) the magnitude of the maximum accelera-
tion
of the mass.
APPROACH Wow, a lot of questions, but we can take them one by one. When the
0.300-kg mass hangs at rest from the spring as in Fig. 11–3b, we apply Newton’s
second law for the vertical forces:
so
For
the horizontal oscillations, the amplitude is given, the velocities are found using
conservation of energy, and the acceleration
