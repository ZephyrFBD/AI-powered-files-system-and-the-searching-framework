 harder to measure?
In Procedures, you will learn how to calculate the rate of cellular respiration by using a 
respirometer system (either microrespirometers or gas pressure sensors with computer 
interface). These measure relative volume (changes in pressure) as oxygen is consumed 
by germinating plant seeds. As oxygen gas is consumed during respiration, it is normally

replaced by CO2 gas at a ratio of one molecule of CO2 for each molecule of O2. Thus, 
you would expect no change in gas volume to result from this experiment. However, in 
the following procedure the CO2 produced is removed by potassium hydroxide (KOH). 
KOH reacts with CO2 to form the solid potassium carbonate (K2CO3) through the 
following reaction: 
CO2 + 2KOH â†’ K2CO3 + H2O 
Thus, as O2 is consumed, the overall gas volume in the respirometer decreases. The 
change in volume can be used to determine the rate of cellular respiration. B
