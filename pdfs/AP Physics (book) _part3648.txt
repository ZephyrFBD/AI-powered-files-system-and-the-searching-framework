3. If gravity is the weakest force, why is it the one we notice
most?
(a) Our bodies are not sensitive to the other forces.
(b) The other forces act only within atoms and therefore
have no effect on us.
(c) Gravity may be “very weak”but always attractive, and the
Earth has enormous mass. The strong and weak nuclear
forces have very short range. The electromagnetic force
has a long range, but most matter is electrically neutral.
(d) At long distances, the gravitational force is actually
stronger than the other forces.
(e) The other forces act only on elementary particles, not
on objects our size.
4. Is it possible for a tau lepton (whose mass is almost twice
that of a proton) to decay into only hadrons?
(a) Yes, because it is so massive it could decay into a
proton and pions.
(b) Yes, it could decay into pions and nothing else.
(c) No, such a de
