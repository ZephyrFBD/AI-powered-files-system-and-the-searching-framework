in the isolated population and 
0.0026 in the general population, showing 
that the rate of genetic mutation is highest 
among individuals in the isolated 
population. 
(C) The frequency of the Ellis-van Creveld allele 
is 0.002 in the isolated population and 
0.0000066 in the general population, which 
demonstrates gametic incompatibility 
between the populations. 
(D) The frequency of the Ellis-van Creveld allele 
is 0.0447 in the isolated population and 
0.0026 in the general population, which 
suggests that genetic drift has occurred in 
the isolated population.
