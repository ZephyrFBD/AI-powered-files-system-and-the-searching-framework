signals act quickly, but it takes hours for the antiviral response to be
expressed by nearby cells. (D) is incorrect because the virus is
nonreplicating, as noted in the question stem, so cell A cannot shed
copies of the virus.

As seen in the figure, if present at a high enough dose acetylcholine
can reverse the eﬀect of atropine, suggesting that the two compounds
compete for the same site on the receptor. (A) is thus correct. (B) is
incorrect because atropine actually has an inhibitory eﬀect: a higher
dose of acetylcholine is required to achieve the same response. (C) is
incorrect because increased acetylcholine reversed the eﬀects of
atropine, indicating that it is not an irreversible inhibitor. (D) is
incorrect because there was a substantial eﬀect: the response curve
moved to the right.

As explained in the question stem, epinephrine binds to a G-protein-
coupled receptor, which initiates a signaling cascade that activates
pr
