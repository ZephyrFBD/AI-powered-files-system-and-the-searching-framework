have the same magnitude (Newton’s third law), and the minus sign
reminds us that these two forces are in opposite directions.
Note carefully that the two forces shown in Fig. 4–11 act on different
objects—to emphasize this we used slightly different colors for the vector arrows
representing these forces. These two forces would never appear together in a 
sum of forces in Newton’s second law,
Why not? Because they act on
different objects:
is the acceleration of one particular object, and 
must
include only the forces on that one object.
