malities and identifiable physical features that result from a deletion of
most of 5p (the small arm of chromosome 5) (Figure 13.10). Infants with this genotype emit a characteristic high-pitched
cry on which the disorder’s name is based.

Chromosomal Structural Rearrangements
Cytologists have characterized numerous structural rearrangements in chromosomes, but chromosome inversions and
translocations are the most common. Both are identified during meiosis by the adaptive pairing of rearranged chromosomes
with their former homologs to maintain appropriate gene alignment. If the genes carried on two homologs are not oriented
correctly, a recombination event could result in the loss of genes from one chromosome and the gain of genes on the other.
This would produce aneuploid gametes.
Chromosome Inversions
A chromosome inversion is the detachment, 180° r
