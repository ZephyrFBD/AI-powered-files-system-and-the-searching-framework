e has magnitude 23 N. What is the mass of the box?
49. (II) Two crates, of mass 65 kg and 125 kg, are in contact and
at rest on a horizontal surface (Fig. 4–57). A 650-N force 
is exerted on the 65-kg crate. If the coefficient of kinetic
friction is 0.18, calculate (a) the acceleration of the sys-
tem, and (b) the force that each crate exerts on the other.
(c) Repeat with the crates reversed.

of steep downhill highways for trucks with overheated brakes.
For a simple 11° upward ramp, what minimum length would
