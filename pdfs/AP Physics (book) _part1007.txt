65. When a mass of 25 kg is hung from the middle of a fixed
straight aluminum wire, the wire sags to make an angle of
12° with the horizontal as shown in Fig. 9–83. Determine
the radius of the wire.
66. A 65.0-kg painter is on a uni-
form 25-kg scaffold supported
from above by ropes (Fig.9–84).
There is a 4.0-kg pail of paint
to one side, as shown. Can the
painter walk safely to both
ends of the scaffold? If not,
which end(s) is dangerous, and
how close to the end can he
approach safely?

67. A 15.0-kg ball is supported from the ceiling by rope A.
Rope B pulls downward and to
the side on the ball. If the angle
of A to the vertical is 22° and if B
makes an angle of 53° to the ver-
tical (Fig. 9–85), find the tensions
in ropes A and B.
