ISE G Four charges of equal magnitude, but possibly different sign, are placed on
the corners of a square. What arrangement of charges will produce an electric field with
the greatest magnitude at the center of the square? (a) All four positive charges; (b) all
four negative charges; (c) three positive and one negative; (d) two positive and two 
negative; (e) three negative and one positive.
