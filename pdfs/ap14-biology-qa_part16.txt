netically modified, it was bad and should be viewed as a 
threat to the ecosystem. Students often confused herbicides with pesticides and stated that GM plants 
may have developed resistance to a pesticide rather than an herbicide. Errors included the assumption 
that the GM crops were sprayed with insecticide rather than produce the insecticidal proteins as a result 
of the genetic modification or that generic chemicals were applied to the crops rather than specific 
treatments. Students also asserted that the modification of a small number of genes in a plant would cause 
a disruption of many other genes in the plant. Some students indicated that all, not just some, of the 
plantâ€™s genes had been genetically modified. 
Finally, students misidentified one of the goals of the genetic modification, i.e., to kill insect pests, as one 
of the potential risks of their use. Students also incorrectly answered the question by providing non-
biological risks (e.g., economic or policy).
