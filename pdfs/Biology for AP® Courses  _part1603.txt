resulting in major changes to the protein and
leading to radically different characteristics in
the offspring. Frameshift mutations cause
multiple amino acid differences in a protein,
leading to small changes in the protein.
d.
Substitution mutations result in a different amino
acid being placed at a specific position in a
protein, causing small changes. Silent mutations
could result in new characteristics possessed by
an offspring when a stop codon is substituted for
an amino acid.
SCIENCE PRACTICE CHALLENGE QUESTIONS
70. The proof that DNA, not protein, is the carrier of
genetic information involved a number of historical
experiments, including transformation or horizontal gene
transfer (HGT), which is the uptake and expression of
extracellular DNA.
A. As described in Figure 14.3, transformation or HGT
