formation, but for each topic, there are just a few key facts you’ll need to
know. Your biology textbooks may go into far greater detail about some of these topics than we do. That’s because
they’re trying to teach you “correct science,” whereas we’re aiming to improve your scores. Our science is perfectly
sound; it’s just cut down to size. We’ve focused on crucial details and given you only what’s important. Moreover,
as you’ll soon see, our treatment of these topics is far easier to handle.
The AP Biology Exam not only tests your content knowledge, but it also tests how you apply that knowledge during
scientific inquiry. Simply put, the test’s authors are testing whether you can design and/or think critically about
experiments and the hypotheses, evidence, math, data, conclusions, and theories therein. There are six broad science
practices that are tested. The weight that each practice holds within the multiple-choice section is given.
