these questions for your benefit.
More often than not, the correct answer is a true statement, but is wrong in the context of the question. However, the
other three tend to be pretty straightforward. Cross off the three that apply, and you’re left with the one that does
not. Here’s a sample question.
All of the following are true statements about gametes EXCEPT
(A) they are haploid cells
(B) they are produced only in the reproductive structures
(C) they bring about genetic variation among offspring
(D) they develop from polar bodies
If you don’t remember anything about gametes and gametogenesis, or the production of gametes, this might be a
particularly difficult problem. We’ll see these again later on, but for now, remember that gametes are the sex cells of
sexually reproducing organisms. As such, we know that they are haploid and are produced in the sexual organs. We
also know that they come together to create offspring.
