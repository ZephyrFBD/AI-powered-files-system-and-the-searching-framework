 layer are
packed tightly, while the spongy cells are loosely packed to allow for
diffusion of gases into and out of these cells. Vascular bundles or veins are
located in the mesophyll and carry water and nutrients from the soil to the
leaves and also carry sugar, the product of photosynthesis, from the leaves
to the rest of the plant. Specialized mesophyll cells called bundle sheath
cells surround the veins and separate them from the rest of the mesophyll.

Figure 14.1 Structure of a Leaf
Stomates
Plants lose water by transpiration. About 90 percent of that water escapes
through stomates, which account for only about 1 percent of the surface of
the leaf. Guard cells are modified epithelium that contain chloroplasts that
control the opening and closing of the stomates by changing their shape.
The cell walls of guard cells are not uniformly thick. Cellulose microfibrils
are oriented in such a direction
