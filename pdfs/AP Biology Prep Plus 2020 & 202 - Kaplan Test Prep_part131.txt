NUCLEUS
The genetic material, the DNA genome, is found in the largest organelle of
a eukaryotic cell, the nucleus. The nucleus is separated from the rest of
the cell by the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that has a large
number of nuclear pores for communication of material between the
interior and exterior of the nucleus. The pores are large enough to allow
proteins to pass through but are also selective in the proteins that are
transported into the nucleus or excluded from the nucleus. Special
sequences in proteins signal a protein to be imported into the nucleus.
While the prokaryotic genome is generally found in a single circular piece
of DNA, the eukaryotic genome in each cell is split into chromosomes.
Chromosomes contain the DNA genome complexed with structural
proteins, called histones, that help package the large strands of DNA in
each chromosome within the limited space of the nucleus. Genes in the
