A–2 Exponents
When we write 
we mean that you multiply 10 by itself four times:
The superscript 4 is called an exponent, and 
10 is said to be raised to the fourth power. Any number or symbol can be
raised to a power. Special names are used when the exponent is 2 (
is “a squared”)
or 3 (
is “a cubed”). For any other power, we say 
is “a to the nth power.” If the
exponent is 1, it is usually dropped:
since no multiplication is involved.
The rules for multiplying numbers expressed as powers are as follows: first,
(A;1)
That is, the exponents are added. To see why, consider the result of the multipli-
cation of 
by 
Here the sum of the exponents is
so rule A–1 works. Notice that 
this rule works only if the base numbers (a in Eq. A–1) are the same. Thus we
cannot use the rule of summing exponents for 
these numbers would
