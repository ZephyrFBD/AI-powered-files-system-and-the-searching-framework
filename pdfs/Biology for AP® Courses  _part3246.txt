The main function of the lens is to focus light on the retina and fovea centralis. The lens is dynamic, focusing and re-

or allow it to thicken, changing the focal length of light coming through it to focus it sharply on the retina. With age comes
the loss of the flexibility of the lens, and a form of farsightedness called presbyopia results. Presbyopia occurs because the
image focuses behind the retina. Presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia ca
