the surrounding environment. The arrows at the far leȇ indicate how
much carbon is lost via respiration. Arrows pointing upward indicate how
much carbon is consumed by species at higher trophic levels, while the
curved arrows pointing down indicate how much carbon is lost to
decomposition by bacteria. Note that some of the sources of carbon loss
for bacteria and small fish are not depicted.
