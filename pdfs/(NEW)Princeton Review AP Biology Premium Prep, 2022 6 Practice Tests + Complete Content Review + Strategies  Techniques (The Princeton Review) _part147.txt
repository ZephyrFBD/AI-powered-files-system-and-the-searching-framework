icult to separate because of the water sticking to the glass
surfaces.
These two forces taken together—cohesion and adhesion—account for the ability of water to rise up the roots,
trunks, and branches of trees. Since this phenomenon occurs in thin vessels, it’s called capillary action.
Surface Tension
The cohesion of water molecules contributes to another property of water, its surface tension. Like a taut trampoline,
the surface of water has a tension to it. The water molecules are stuck together and light things like leaves and water
striders can sit atop the surface without sinking.
High Heat Capacity
Another remarkable property of water is its high heat capacity. What’s heat capacity? Your textbook will give you a
definition something like this: “heat capacity is the quantity of heat required to change the temperature of a
substance by 1 degree.” What does that mean? In plain English, heat capacity refers to the ability of a substance to
resist temperature changes. For example, whe
