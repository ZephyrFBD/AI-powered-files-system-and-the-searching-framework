 now no long-term solution to nuclear waste storage in the 
United States.
In spite of these difficulties, nuclear power is making a modest comeback as an 
energy source. Concerns about climate change caused by escalating atmospheric CO2 
levels 
 (Section 18.2) have increased support for nuclear power as a major energy 
source in the future. Increasing demand for power in rapidly developing countries, par-
ticularly China, has sparked a rise in construction of new nuclear power plants in those 
parts of the world.
21.8 ∣ Nuclear Power: Fusion
Energy is produced when light nuclei fuse into heavier ones. Reactions of this type are 
responsible for the energy produced by the Sun. Spectroscopic studies indicate that the 
mass composition of the Sun is 74% H, 25% He, and only 1% all other elements. The fol-
lowing reactions are among the numerous fusion processes believed to occur in the Sun:
