addition to the internally controlled checkpoints, there are two groups of intracellular molecules that regulate the cell
cycle. These regulatory molecules either promote progress of the cell to the next phase (positive regulation) or halt the cycle
(negative regulation). Regulator molecules may act individually, or they can influence the activity or production of other
regulatory proteins. Therefore, the failure of a single regulator may have almost no effect on the cell cycle, especially if
more than one mechanism controls the same event. Conversely, the effect of a deficient or non-functioning regulator can be
wide-ranging and possibly fatal to the cell if multiple processes are affected.
Positive Regulation of the Cell Cycle
Two groups of proteins, called cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), are responsible for the progress of the cell
through the various checkpoints. The levels of the four cyclin proteins fluctuate throughout the cell cycle in a predictable
pattern (Figure
