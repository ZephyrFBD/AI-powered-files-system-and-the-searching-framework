half that of the battery, or 4.0 V. Thus the voltmeter, because
of its internal resistance, gives a low reading. It is off by 0.5 V, or more than 10%.
NOTE Often the sensitivity of a voltmeter is specified on its face as, for example,
Then on a 5.0-V scale, the voltmeter would have a resistance given by
The meter’s resistance depends on the scale used.

Effects of Meter Resistance
It is important to know the sensitivity of a meter, for in many cases the resistance
of the meter can seriously affect your results. Consider the following Example.
