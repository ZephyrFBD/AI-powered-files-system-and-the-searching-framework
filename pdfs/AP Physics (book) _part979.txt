If the force is too great, the object will exceed its elastic limit,
which means it will no longer return to its original shape when
the distorting force is removed. If the force is even greater, the
ultimate strength of the material can be exceeded, and the
object will fracture. The force per unit area acting on an object
is the stress, and the resulting fractional change in length is the
strain.
The stress on an object is present within the object and
can be of three types: compression, tension, or shear. The ratio
of stress to strain is called the elastic modulus of the material.
Young’s modulus applies for compression and tension, and the
shear modulus for shear. Bulk modulus applies to an object
whose volume changes as a result of pressure on all sides. All
three moduli are constants for a given material when distorted
within the elastic region.
