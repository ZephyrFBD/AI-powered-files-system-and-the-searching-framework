 2. An absorption spectrum indicates the relative amount of light absorbed across a range of wavelengths. The 
graphs above represent the absorption spectra of individual pigments isolated from two different organisms.  
One of the pigments is chlorophyll a, commonly found in green plants. The other pigment is bacteriorhodopsin, 
commonly found in purple photosynthetic bacteria. The table above shows the approximate ranges of 
wavelengths of different colors in the visible light spectrum. 
(a) Identify the pigment (chlorophyll a or
