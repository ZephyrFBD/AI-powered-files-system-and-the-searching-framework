page 300 No. Cl has seven valence electrons. The first and second 
Lewis symbols are both correct—they both show seven valence 
electrons, and it doesn’t matter which of the four sides has the 
single electron. The third symbol shows only five electrons and is 
incorrect. page 303 No. This reaction corresponds to the lattice 
energy for KCl, which is a large positive number. Therefore, the 
reaction will cost energy, not release energy. page 306 Rhodium, 
Rh page 307 Weaker. In both H2 and H2
+ the two H atoms are 
principally held together by the electrostatic attractions between 
the nuclei and the electrons concentrated between them. H2
  +  has  
only one electron between the nuclei whereas H2 has two and this 
results in the H  ¬
 H bond in H2 being stronger. page 309 Triple 
bond. CO2 has two C ¬ O double bonds. Because the C ¬ O bond  
in carbon monoxide is shorter, it is likely to be a triple bond.
