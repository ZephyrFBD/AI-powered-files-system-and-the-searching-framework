ct to increase  
(Figure 1.15). Although the temperature of an object is intuitive to most people, the defi-
nition of work is less apparent. We define work, w, as the product of the force exerted on 
the object, F, and the distance, d, that it moves:
 
w = F * d 
[1.1]
where force is defined as any push or pull exerted on the object.* Familiar examples in-
clude gravity and the attraction between opposite poles of a bar magnet. It takes work to 
lift an object off of the floor, or to pull apart two magnets that have come together at the 
opposite poles.
Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy
To understand energy we need to grasp its two fundamental forms, kinetic energy and 
potential energy. Objects, whether they are automobiles, soccer balls, or molecules, can 
possess kinetic energy, the energy of motion. The magnitude of kinetic energy, Ek, 
 
of an object depends on its mass, m, and velocity, v:
 
Ek = 1
2 mv2 
[1.2]
Thus, the kinetic energy of an object increases as its velocity or
