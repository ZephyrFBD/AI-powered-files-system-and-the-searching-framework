ne has a distinct group of species
adapted to the biotic and abiotic conditions particular to that zone.
The intertidal zone, which is the zone between high and low tide, is the oceanic region that is closest to land (Figure
35.21). Generally, most people think of this portion of the ocean as a sandy beach. In some cases, the intertidal zone is
indeed a sandy beach, but it can also be rocky or muddy. The intertidal zone is an extremely variable environment because
of tides. Organisms are exposed to air and sunlight at low tide and are underwater most of the time, especially during high
tide. Therefore, living things that thrive in the intertidal zone are adapted to being dry for long periods of time. The shore
of the intertidal zone is also repeatedly struck by waves, and the organisms found there are adapted to withstand damage
from the pounding action of the waves (Figure 35.22). The exoskeletons of shoreline crustaceans (such as the shore crab,
Carcinus maenas) are tough and protect
