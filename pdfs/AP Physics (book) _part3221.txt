state, for which the spins are the same. The two
electrons cannot both be in the lowest energy state and be attached to the same
atom, for then they would have identical quantum numbers in violation of the
exclusion principle. The exclusion principle tells us that, because no two electrons
can occupy the same quantum state, if two electrons have the same quantum
numbers, they must be different in some other way—namely, by being in different
places in space (for example, attached to different atoms). Thus, for 
when
the two atoms approach each other, the electrons will stay away from each other
as shown by the probability distribution of Fig. 29–1. The electrons spend very
little time between the two nuclei, so the positively charged nuclei repel each
other and no bond is formed.
For the 
state, on the other hand, the spins are opposite and the two
electrons are consequently in different quantum states (
is different,
for
one,
for the other). Hence the two electrons can come close toge
