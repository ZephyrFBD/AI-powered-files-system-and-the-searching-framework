phase of a substance is present at any given temperature and pressure.
The phase diagram for any substance that can exist in all three phases of matter 
is shown in Figure 11.27. The diagram contains three important curves, each of which 
represents the temperature and pressure at which the various phases can coexist at equi-
librium. The only substance present in the system is the one whose phase diagram is 
under consideration. The pressure shown in the diagram is either the pressure applied

Imagine that the pressure on the solid phase in the figure is decreased at 
constant temperature. If the solid eventually sublimes, what must be true 
about the temperature?
