ive pressure in the xylem
channels—resulting in less water traveling from the roots through the
xylem—eliminating (C). Finally, the grasses would be expected to increase
their photosynthetic rates (despite the lower stomatal conductance)
because of the greater availability of CO2. The fact that plant height
increased supports this—eliminating (A). (D) is correct because, while
mineral uptake occurs through the phloem via the pull of osmotic
pressure, uptake of potassium occurs through passive rather than active
transport.
2. D
Human cells are eukaryotic with nuclear envelopes around their genetic
material that could prevent the drug from accessing the DNA even aȇer
entering the cell while bacteria are prokaryotes and only possess a
nucleoid region within their cytoplasm; thus, the drug would be able to
access bacterial DNA aȇer entering the cell (D). (A) is incorrect given the
question has stated the drug can enter both bacterial and human cells,
which makes the cell wall irrelevant to
