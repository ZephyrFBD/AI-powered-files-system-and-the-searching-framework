t identifying conjugate acid–base pairs it is not 
difficult to write equations for reactions involving Brønsted–Lowry acids and bases 
(proton-transfer reactions).
The hydrogen sulfite ion 1HSO3
-2 is amphiprotic. Write an equation for the reaction of HSO3
- with water (a) in which the ion acts 
as an acid and (b) in which the ion acts as a base. In both cases identify the conjugate acid–base pairs.
Sample Exercise 16.2 
Writing Equations for Proton-Transfer Reactions
SOLUTION
Analyze and Plan We are asked to write two equations representing 
reactions between HSO3
-  and water, one in which HSO3
-  should 
donate a proton to water, thereby acting as a Brønsted–Lowry 
acid, and one in which HSO3
-  should accept a proton from water, 
thereby acting as a base. We are also asked to identify the conju-
gate pairs in each equation.
Solve
(a)  
HSO3
-1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ SO3
2 -1aq2 + H3O+1aq2 
The conjugate pairs in this equation are HSO3
-  (acid) and SO3
2 -  
(conjugate base), and H2O (base
