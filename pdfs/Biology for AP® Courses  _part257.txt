cids contain genetic information.
While all living things, including humans, need macromolecules in their daily diet, an imbalance of any one of them can
lead to health problems. For example, eating too much fat can lead to cardiovascular problems, and too much protein can
lead to problems with the kidneys. Some people think that removing whole grains, such as wheat, from one’s diet can be
beneficial. However, scientists have found that to not be true for the majority of people. In fact, just the opposite may be
true, because whole wheat contains more dietary fiber than other types of grains. The full research review can be found here
