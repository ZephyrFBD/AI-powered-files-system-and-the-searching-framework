 forms (according to the first law of thermodynamics). (C) is
incorrect because the first law does not pertain to entropy.

Water will reach a higher point if adhesion is greater in the vessel.
Adhesion would be greater in the negatively-charged lining of the
flowering plant’s vessels, while adhesion would be minimal to a
hydrophobic surface, such as the lining of Myrothamnus. (C) is thus
correct. (A) and (B) are incorrect because the dye will reach a higher
level in the flowering plant. (D) is incorrect because the hydrophobic
lining only aﬀects adhesion and not cohesion, which describes the
attractive forces between the water molecules themselves.

Since the molecule is single-stranded, it is likely RNA. DNA is usually
double-stranded. Although certain viruses have single-stranded DNA,
the scientist has already determined that the nucleic acid does not
have viral origins. Because RNA contains ribose (a pentose), a
phosphate grou
