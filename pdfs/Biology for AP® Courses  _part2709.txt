Ethylene is widely used in agriculture. Commercial fruit growers control the timing of fruit ripening with application of
the gas. Horticulturalists inhibit leaf dropping in ornamental plants by removing ethylene from greenhouses using fans and
ventilation.
Nontraditional Hormones
Recent research has discovered a number of compounds that also influence plant development. Their roles are less
understood than the effects of the major hormones described so far.
Jasmonates play a major role in defense responses to herbivory. Their levels increase when a plant is wounded by a
predator, resulting in an increase in toxic secondary metabolites. They contribute to the production of volatile compounds
that attract natural enemies of predators. For example, chewing of tomato plants by caterpillars leads to an increase in
jasmonic acid levels, which in turn triggers the release of volatile compounds that attract predators of the pest.
