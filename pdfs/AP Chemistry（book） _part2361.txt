e in actually carrying 
out this experiment? (c) You now want to test whether a particu-
lar water-soluble substance Q is a homogeneous catalyst for the 
reaction. What experiments can you carry out to test this notion? 
 
(d) If Q does indeed catalyze the reaction, what follow-up experi-
ments might you undertake to learn more about the reaction pro-
file for the reaction?

Imagine you are at sea in a small sailboat that springs a leak. As the boat 
slowly fills with water, you look for a way to get the water out of the 
boat before it sinks. Just as things are starting to look bleak, you find a 
plastic water bottle and start bailing water out of the boat. After much 
effort, you are able to lower the water level down to a few centimeters, 
at which point your rate of bailing slows down because you can no lon-
ger completely fill the bottle by submersing it. Eventually, the rate at 
which water enters the boat through the leak becomes equal to the rate 
at whi
