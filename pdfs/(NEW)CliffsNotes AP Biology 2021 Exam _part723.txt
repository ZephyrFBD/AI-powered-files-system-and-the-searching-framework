cs. By looking like similarly colored bees and wasps, they fool predators into
thinking that they are armed and dangerous.
2. Keystone species are more likely to be found in small, simple communities. Large, complex communities have
many interacting populations, and the removal of one species can more likely be replaced with another species
whose niche may be comparable enough to maintain the stability of the community. If a species can be removed
without major negative consequences to the community, then it isnâ€™t a keystone species.
Some Typical Answers to Long Questions
Question 1
For this question, you should begin by describing intrinsic, exponential population growth. Describe how
populations experiencing rapid growth can deplete their resources and subsequently crash to extinction. Then,
discuss the different kinds of limiting factors (density-dependent and density-independent) that restrict populations
to logistic growth and that limit the size of populations to the carrying cap
