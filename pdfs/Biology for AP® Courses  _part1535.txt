Review the full process of DNA replication here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/replication_DNA) .
Explain why errors in DNA replication are rare events in cells.
a.
Errors in DNA replication are rare events in a cell due to the presence of DNA ligase enzyme which fixes
mistakes in the copying process.
b.
Polymerase I is solely responsible for proofreading and fixing mistakes in the copying process, which
explains why so few mistakes are made.
c.
Polymerase I and II are responsible for proofreading and fixing mistakes in the copying process which
explains why errors in DNA replication are rare.
d.
Errors in DNA replication are rare events in cells due to the action of DNA helicase.
Activity
Use the model of DNA you constructed in Section 14.2 to demonstrate the process of replication in
prokaryotes, showing how the activities differ on the leading and lagging strands. You need to add to your
model by including enzymes and other proteins involved in the replication process.
