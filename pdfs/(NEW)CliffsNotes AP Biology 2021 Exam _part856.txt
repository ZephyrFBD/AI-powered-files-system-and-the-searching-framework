Questions 41-43 refer to the following:
 
An experiment designed to evaluate the importance of chloroplasts and
 
light on photosynthetic activity uses DPIP as a substitute for NADP+. Oxidized DPIP (substituting for NADP+) is
blue, and reduced DPIP
(substituting for NADPH) is clear. The following graph shows the results of the experiment using healthy
chloroplasts, boiled chloroplasts, o
