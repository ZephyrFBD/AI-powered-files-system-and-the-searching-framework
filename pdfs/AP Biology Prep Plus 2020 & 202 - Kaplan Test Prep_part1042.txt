The plant in question is grown in darkness, and certain traits are observed, but then the
same plant is transported into the light and the previously observed traits are “reversed.”
Without light, the plant produces tall stems and non-expanded leaves—as if it were
simply trying to reach something. When presented with light, the same plant develops
broad, green leaves and short sturdy stems and long roots (i.e., it begins to look like a
“normal plant”). The best explanation is that the plant is exhibiting normal behavior,
which is explained if the plant normally sprouts underground. (D) is thus correct. (A) can
be eliminated because the plant is observed to expend energy (tall stems and leaves) in
darkness. (B) is wrong because the sunlight actually thickens the stems—the elongation
is more evident in the darkness. (C) may be tempting, but cannot be concluded because
there is no evidence of mechanical stress.
