r(s) you chose to investigate on the rate of cellular respiration. 
Step 3 Conduct your experiment(s) and record data and any answers to your questions in 
your laboratory notebook or as per instructed by your teacher.

Step 4 Record your data using appropriate methods, such as the example table provided 
in Procedures. Then graph the results to show the effect of the factors/variables you 
investigated on the rate of cellular respiration. Calculate the rate(s) of cellular respiration 
for each factor/variable. 
â–  Analyzing Results 
1. Your teacher may suggest that you perform statistical analysis of your data, 
comparing results of the experimental variable(s) to the controls. You should at least 
express the uncertainty of your measurements with error bars. You may want to 
review Chapter 3 for more information about statistical analysis. 
2. How was the rate of cellular respiration affected by the experimental var
