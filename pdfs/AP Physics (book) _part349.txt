starts moving backward. The force she exerts on the wall cannot make her start
moving, because that force acts on the wall. Something had to exert a force on her
to start her moving, and that force could only have been exerted by the wall.
The force with which the wall pushes on her is, by Newton’s third law, equal and
opposite to the force she exerts on the wall.
When a person throws a package out of a small boat (initially at rest), the
boat starts moving in the opposite direction. The person exerts a force on the
package. The package exerts an equal and opposite force back on the person,
and this force propels the person (and the boat) backward slightly.
Rocket propulsion also is explained using Newton’s third law (Fig. 4–10).
A common misconception is that rockets accelerate because the gases rushing
out the back of the engine push against the ground or the atmosphere. Not true.
What happens, instead, is that a rocket exerts a strong force on the gases, expel-
ling them; and the
