Gene Expression and Regulation
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.N.4
The DNA strand acting as the template strand 
is also referred to as the noncoding strand, 
minus strand, or antisense strand. Selection 
of which DNA strand serves as the template 
strand depends on the gene being transcribed.
IST-1.N.5
The enzyme RNA polymerase synthesizes 
mRNA molecules in the 5’ to 3’ direction by 
reading the template DNA strand in the 3’ to 5’ 
direction.
IST-1.N.6
In eukaryotic cells the mRNA transcript 
undergoes a series of enzyme-regulated 
modifications—
a. Addition of a poly-A tail.
b. Addition of a GTP cap.
c.	Excision of introns and splicing and retention 
of exons.
d. Excision of introns and splicing and retention 
of exons can generate different versions of 
the resul
