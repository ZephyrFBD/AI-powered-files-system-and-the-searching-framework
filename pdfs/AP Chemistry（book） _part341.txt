, but you will en-
counter many examples of them throughout the text. Here we present a brief introduc-
tion to some of the simplest organic compounds and the ways in which they are named.
Alkanes
Compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen are called hydrocarbons. In the 
simplest class of hydrocarbons, alkanes, each carbon is bonded to four other atoms. 
The three smallest alkanes are methane 1CH42, ethane 1C2H62, and propane 1C3H82. The 
structural formulas of these three alkanes are as follows:
