OSMOSIS: the term used for a specific type of diffusion of water
across a membrane
SOLVENT: the substance that does the dissolving
SOLUTE: the substance that dissolves
HYPERTONIC: having greater concentration of solute than another
solution
HYPOTONIC: having lesser concentration of solute than another
solution
ISOTONIC: two solutions containing equal concentration of solutes
OSMOTIC POTENTIAL: the tendency of water to move across a
permeable membrane into a solution
WATER POTENTIAL: Scientists look at movement of water in terms
of water potential. Water potential, symbolized by the Greek letter
psi, ψ, results from two factors: solute concentration and pressure.
The water potential for pure water is zero; the addition of solutes
lowers water potential to a value less than zero. Therefore, the
water potential inside a cell is a negative value. Water will move
across a membrane fr
