its hole is to be large enough so it will slip over the rod?
APPROACH The hole in the ring must be increased from a diameter of 6.420 cm
to
The ring must be heated since the hole
diameter will increase linearly with temperature (Example 13–4).
SOLUTION We solve for 
in Eq. 13–1a and find
So the ring must be raised at least to

EXAMPLE 13;5
Opening a tight jar lid. When the lid of
a glass jar is tight, holding the lid under hot water for a short time will often make
it easier to open (Fig. 13–12). Why?
RESPONSE The lid may be struck by the hot water more directly than the
glass and so expand sooner. But even if not, metals generally expand more than
glass for the same temperature change (
is greater—see Table 13–1).
