66. (III) Air that is at its dew point of 5°C is drawn into a
building where it is heated to 22°C. What will be the relative
humidity at this temperature? Assume constant pressure
of 1.0 atm. Take into account the expansion of the air.

67. (III) When using a mercury barometer (Section 10–6), the
vapor pressure of mercury is usually assumed to be zero.
At room temperature mercury’s vapor pressure is about
0.0015 mm-Hg. At sea level, the height h of mercury in a
barometer is about 760 mm. (a) If the vapor pressure of
mercury is neglected, is the true atmospheric pressure
greater or less than the value read from the barometer?
(b) What is the percent error? (c) What is the percent error
if you use a water barometer and ignore water’s saturated
vapor pressure at STP?
