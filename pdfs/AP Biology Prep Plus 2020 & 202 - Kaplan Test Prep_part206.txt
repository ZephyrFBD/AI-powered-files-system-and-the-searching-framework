d organelles. Bacteria exist in three basic
shapes: cocci (round), bacilli (rod), and spirilla (spiral). Some bacteria
also contain plasmids and have flagella (whiplike appendages) for
motility and/or have pili (hair-like appendages) for surface attachment.

The study of bacteria falls under a branch of microbiology known
as bacteriology. Bacteriology is a growing field with a rapidly
expanding knowledge base, but this section is limited only to
material that is highly tested on the AP Biology exam.
In response to changes in their environment, bacteria may undergo
chemotaxis and quorum sensing. Chemotaxis involves bacteria
responding to a chemical stimulus by moving in a certain direction. For
example, bacteria move toward higher concentrations of food molecules
like glucose and move away from higher concentrations of toxins like
phenol. Quorum sensing involves cell-to-cell communicati
