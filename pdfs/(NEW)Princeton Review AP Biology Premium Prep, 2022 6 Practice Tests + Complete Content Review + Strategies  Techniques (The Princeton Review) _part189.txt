ernae. A Golgi stack may contain anywhere from 3 to
20 cisternae, and these are divided into cis (close to the RER), medial (in the
middle), and trans (farthest from the RER). Each cisternae type contains
different types of enzymes, and molecules can move between cisternae via
vesicles.
Golgi Bodies
The Golgi bodies, which look like stacks of flattened sacs, also participate in the processing of proteins. Once the
ribosomes on the rough ER have completed synthesizing proteins, the Golgi bodies modify, process, and sort the
products. They’re the packaging and distribution centers for materials destined to be sent out of the cell. They
package the final products in little sacs called vesicles, which carry products to the plasma membrane. Golgi bodies
are also involved in the production of lysosomes.
Mitochondria
Another important organelle is the mitochondrion. Mitochondria are often referred to as the “powerhouses” of the
cell. They’re power stations responsible for converting energy fr
