rand is DNA polymerase. But DNA polymerase, oddly enough, can add
nucleotides only to the 3’ end of an existing strand. Therefore, to start off replication, an enzyme called RNA
primase adds a short strand of RNA nucleotides called an RNA primer. After replication, the primer is degraded by
enzymes and replaced with DNA so that the final strand contains only DNA.
Neither DNA strand is directly copied; however, by building a new partner
strand for each of them, a two-stranded molecule is created that is identical to
the original.
During DNA replication, one DNA strand is called the leading strand, and it is made continuously. That is, the
nucleotides are steadily added one after the other by DNA polymerase. The other strand—the lagging strand—is
made discontinuously. Unlike the leading strand, the lagging strand is made in pieces of nucleotides known as
Okazaki fragments. Why is the lagging strand made in small pieces?
Nucleotides are added only in the 5’ to 3’ direction since nucleotid
