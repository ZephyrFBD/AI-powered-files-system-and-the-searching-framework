environments have lower photosynthetic rates and therefore less biomass. The animal communities living there will also be
affected by the decrease in available food.

with their environments to move matter and energy. Biomes are ripe with examples of these interactions. A biome refers
to a major type of terrestrial (or aquatic) community distributed according to climate, which d
