 responsibility of 
supporting their opinions 
and responses using 
specific evidence.
Divide students into two 
groups, and ask them for 
form two concentric circles. 
The inner circle can explain 
photosynthesis to the students 
in the outer circle, and the 
outer circle can explain cellular 
respiration to students in the 
inner circle.
Graph and 
Switch
Generating a graph 
to represent data and 
then switch papers to 
review each other’s 
representations.
Allows students to 
practice creating different 
representations of 
data and both give and 
receive feedback on each 
other’s work.
Give students a data table, and 
ask them to graph the data. 
They switch papers and then 
offer one another feedback. 
This can be scaffolded by 
distributing multiple data tables 
that require different types of 
graphs. Students can exchange 
papers and provide feedback 
on whether their classmate(s) 
graphed the data appropriately.
