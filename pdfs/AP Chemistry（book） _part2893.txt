▲ Figure 18.12 Earth’s thermal balance. The amount of radiation reaching the surface of the 
planet is equal to the amount radiated back into space.
Figure 18.13 shows the fraction of infrared radiation leaving the surface that is absorbed 
by atmospheric water vapor and carbon dioxide. In absorbing this radiation, these two 
atmospheric gases help maintain a livable uniform temperature at the surface by hold-
ing in, as it were, the infrared radiation, which we feel as heat.
The influence of H2O, CO2, and certain other atmospheric gases on Earth’s tempera-
ture is called the greenhouse effect because in trapping infrared radiation these gases act 
much like the glass of a greenhouse. The gases themselves are
