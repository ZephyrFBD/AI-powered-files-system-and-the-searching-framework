be either DNA or RNA viruses. Cancers known to be associated with viral
infections include cervical cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) (Figure 21.12), liver cancer caused by hepatitis
B virus, T-cell leukemia, and several types of lymphoma.
Figure 21.12 HPV, or human papillomavirus, has a naked icosahedral capsid visible in this transmission electron
micrograph and a double-stranded DNA genome that is incorporated into the host DNA. The virus, is oncogenic and
can lead to cervical cancer. (credit: modification of work by NCI, NIH; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
