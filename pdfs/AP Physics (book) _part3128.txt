Suppose that the object can be detected by a single photon. The photon has a
momentum 
(Eq. 27–6). When the photon strikes our object, it will
give some or all of this momentum to the object, Fig. 28–5. Therefore, the final
x momentum of our object will be uncertain in the amount
since we can’t tell how much momentum will be transferred. The product of
these uncertainties is
The uncertainties could be larger than this, depending on the apparatus and the
number of photons needed for detection. A more careful mathematical calcula-
tion shows the product of the uncertainties as, at best, about

This is a mathematical statement of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, or, as it
is sometimes called, the indeterminancy principle. It tells us that we cannot measure
both the position and momentum of an object precisely at the same
