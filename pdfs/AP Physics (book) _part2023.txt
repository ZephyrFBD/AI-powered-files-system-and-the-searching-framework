Problems
9. (II) A hair dryer draws 13.5 A when plugged into a 120-V
line. (a) What is its resistance? (b) How much charge
passes through it in 15 min? (Assume direct current.)
10. (II) A 4.5-V battery is connected to a bulb whose resistance
is 
How many electrons leave the battery per minute?
11. (II) An electric device draws 5.60 A at 240 V. (a) If the
voltage drops by 15%, what will be the current, assuming
nothing else changes? (b) If the resistance of the device were
reduced by 15%, what current would be drawn at 240 V?
