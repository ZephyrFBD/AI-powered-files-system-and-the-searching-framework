shows a spaceship traveling past Earth at high speed. The point
of view of an observer on the spaceship is shown in part (a), and that of an observer
on Earth in part (b). Both observers have accurate clocks. The person on the space-
ship (Fig. 26–6a) flashes a light and measures the time it takes the light to travel
directly across the spaceship and return after reflecting from a mirror (the rays are
drawn at a slight angle for clarity). In the reference frame of the spaceship, the

Time Dilation and the Twin Paradox

FIGURE 26–6 Time dilation can be
shown by a thought experiment: the 
time it takes for light to travel across
a spaceship and back is longer for the
observer on Earth (b) than for the
observer on the spaceship (a).
