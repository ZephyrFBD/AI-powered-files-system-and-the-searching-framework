d from ice cores. The deeper the sample, the older
the sample. The percent departure from the current O18
percentage that is graphed above is a measure of
temperature relative to the present temperature. The higher
the isotope concentration, the higher the average
temperature of the ocean.

A. Refine the graph by adding the interval of time of
extinction with a label drawn from the table as shown by
“a”.
B. Analyze these data in terms of the clustering of
extinction events.
C. Based on your analysis, explain how ecosystems have
changed during the last 40,000 years, changed and
identify the factor that caused these changes.
D. Based on the correlation between Earth’s temperature
and the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, predict
what will happen to animal populations in the future.
