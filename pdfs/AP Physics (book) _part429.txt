pulley and
a weight is hung from the other
end (Fig. 4–45). Determine the
force that the table exerts on 
the box if the weight hanging 
on the other side of the pulley
weighs (a) 30.0 N, (b) 60.0 N, and
(c) 90.0 N.

Problem 20.
29. (II) At the instant a race began, a 65-kg sprinter exerted a
force of 720 N on the starting block at a 22° angle with
respect to the ground. (a) What was the horizontal acceler-
ation of the sprinter? (b) If the force was exerted for 0.32 s,
with what speed did the sprinter leave the starting block?
30. (II) A 27-kg chandelier hangs from a ceiling on a vertical
4.0-m-long wire. (a) What horizontal force would be neces-
sary to displace its position 0.15 m to one side? (b) What
will be the tension in the wire?
31. (II) An object is hanging by a string from your rearview
mirror. While you are decelerating at a constant rate from
to rest in 6.0 s, (a) what angle does the string make
with the vertical, and (b) is it toward the windshield or
away from
