e, poisonous gas with a sharp, irritating odor. Many people can detect 
as little as 0.01 ppm in air. Exposure to 0.1 to 1 ppm produces headaches, burning eyes, 
and irritation to the respiratory passages.
The O3 molecule possesses p electrons that are delocalized over the three oxygen 
atoms. 
 (Section 8.6) The molecule dissociates readily, forming reactive oxygen atoms:
 
O31g2 ¡ O21g2 + O1g2 ∆H° = 105 kJ

Ozone is a stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen. Ozone forms oxides with many 
elements under conditions where O2 will not react; indeed, it oxidizes all the common 
metals except gold and platinum.
Ozone can be prepared by passing electricity through dry O2. During thunderstorms, 
ozone is generated (and can be smelled, if you are too close) from lightning strikes:

Ozone is sometimes used to treat drinking water. Like Cl2, ozone kills bacteria and 
oxidizes organic compounds. The largest use of ozone, however, is in t
