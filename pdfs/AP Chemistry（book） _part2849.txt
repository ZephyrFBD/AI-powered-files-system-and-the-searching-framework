sible that 
the bottle was not well sealed, and some water evaporated.
Design an experiment to determine the concentration of the NaOH, 
using a very small amount from the bottle (less than 1 mL). Consider 
that you have unlimited water available, a stock solution of 2.00 M 
HCl, and any pH indicators you need. Also consider that your equip-
ment only allows you to measure volumes to the nearest mL.

 18.1 ▶  Earth’s Atmosphere Investigate 
the temperature profile, pressure profile, 
and chemical composition of Earth’s 
atmosphere. Examine photoionization and 
photodissociation, reactions that result from 
atmospheric absorption of solar radiation.
 18.2 ▶  Human Activities and Earth’s 
Atmosphere Consider the effect human 
activities have on the atmosphere, including 
how atmospheric ozone is depleted by 
reactions involving human-made gases and 
how acid rain and smog are produced.
 18.3 ▶  Earth’s Water Examine the global 
water cycle, which des
