 of the wire sensor changes by 
and the resulting
change 
in the sensor’s resistance is measured. Assuming
that as the solid wire is deformed to a length
its density
and volume remain constant (only approximately valid),
show that the strain 
of the wire sensor, and 
thus of the object to which it is attached, is approximately

Air is brought into the room at 5°C and is completely
replaced twice per hour. Heat loss through the walls amounts

If the air is to be maintained 
at 22°C, what minimum wattage must the heater have?

copper. (a) Using Table 18–1, find the ratio of the resistance
of a copper wire to that of an aluminum wire of the same
length and diameter. (b) Typ
