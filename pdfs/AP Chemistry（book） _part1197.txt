ch each of the three Cl atoms is bonded 
to the As atom? (b) What bond length is predicted for AsCl3, 
using the atomic radii in Figure 7.7?
 7.86  The following observations are made about two hypothetical 
elements A and B: The A ¬ A and B¬ B bond lengths in the 
elemental forms of A and B are 2.36 and 1.94 Å, respectively. 
A and B react to form the binary compound AB2, which has 
a linear structure (that is ∠B-A-B = 180°). Based on these 
statements, predict the separation between the two B nuclei 
in a molecule of AB2.
 7.87  Elements in group 7A in the periodic table are called the hal-
ogens; elements in group 6A are called the chalcogens. (a) 
What is the most common oxidation state of the chalcogens 
compared to the halogens? (b) For each of the following peri-
odic properties, state whether the halogens or the chalcogens 
have larger values: atomic radii, ionic radii of the most com-
mon oxidation state, ﬁrst ionization energy, second ioniza-
tion energy.
