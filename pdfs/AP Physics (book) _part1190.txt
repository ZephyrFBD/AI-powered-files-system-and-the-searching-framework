(11;13)
This formula makes sense qualitatively on the basis of Newtonian mechanics.
That is, we do expect the tension to be in the numerator and the mass per unit
length in the denominator. Why? Because when the tension is greater, we expect
the speed to be greater since each segment of cord is in tighter contact with its
neighbor. Also, the greater the mass per unit length, the more inertia the cord
has and the more slowly the wave would be expected to propagate.

A longitudinal wave can be represented graphically by plotting the density of
air molecules (or coils of a Slinky) versus position at a given instant, as shown in
Fig. 11–27. Such a graphical representation makes it easy to illustrate what is
happening. Note that the graph looks much like a transverse wave.
