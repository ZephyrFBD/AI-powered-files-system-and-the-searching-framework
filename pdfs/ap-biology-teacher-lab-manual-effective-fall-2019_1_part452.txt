Total of (o - e)2/e = chi-square (χ2) = 22.06 
Since the calculated χ2 is greater than the table value, the null hypothesis (treatment has 
no effect) is rejected.

■ Postlab Review 
These questions can be answered in a report, as a group activity, or as homework. 
•  What was the importance of collecting the class data? 
•  Was there a significant difference between the groups? 
•  Did the fungal pathogen lectin increase the number of cells in mitosis? 
•  What other ex
