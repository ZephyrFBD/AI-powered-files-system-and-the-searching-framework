on of the alternation of generations, the relative size of the sporophyte and the
gametophyte and the relationship between them vary greatly. In plants such as moss, the gametophyte organism is the
free-living plant, and the sporophyte is physically dependent on the gametophyte. In other plants, such as ferns, both the
gametophyte and sporophyte plants are free-living; however, the sporophyte is much larger. In seed plants, such as magnolia
trees and daisies, the gametophyte is composed of only a few cells and, in the case of the female gametophyte, is completely
retained within the sporophyte.
Sexual reproduction takes many forms in multicellular organisms. However, at some point in each type of life cycle, meiosis
produces haploid cells that will fuse with the haploid cell of another organism. The mechanisms of variation—crossover,
random assortment of homologous chromosomes, and random fertilization—are present in all versions of sexual
reproduction. The fact that nearly every multi
