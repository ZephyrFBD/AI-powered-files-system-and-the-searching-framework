Question 8 
 
An individual has lost the ability to activate B-cells and mount a humoral immune response. 
(a) Propose ONE direct consequence of the loss of B-cell activity on the individual’s humoral immune 
response to an initial exposure to a bacterial pathogen. 
Proposal (1 point) 
• 
Does not produce antibodies 
• 
Does not produce memory B cells 
 
(b) Propose ONE direct consequence of the loss of B-cell activity on the speed of the individual’s 
humoral immune response to a second exposure to the bacterial pathogen. 
Proposal (1 point) 
• 
Does not mount a faster response than the first response 
• 
Mounts a second response at the same speed as the first response  
• 
Mounts a second response more slowly than would a normal individual 
 
(c) Describe ONE characteristic of the individual’s immune response to the bacterial pathogen that is 
not affected by the loss of B cells.  
Description (1 point) 
• 
Cell-mediated immunity still active 
• 
Components of cell medi
