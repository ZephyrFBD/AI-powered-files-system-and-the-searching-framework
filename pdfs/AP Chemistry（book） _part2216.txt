ple of N2O5 with an initial 
pressure of 760 torr decomposes at 25 °C until its partial pres-
sure is 650 torr. How much time (in seconds) has elapsed?
(a) 5.3 * 10-6 (b) 2000 (c) 4600 (d) 34,000 (e) 190,000
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
The decomposition of dimethyl ether, 1CH322O, at 510 °C is a 
first-order process with a rate constant of 6.8 * 10-4 s-1:
1CH322O1g2 ¡ CH41g2 + H21g2 + CO1g2
If the initial pressure of 1CH322O is 135 torr, what is its pres-
sure after 1420 s?
Equation 14.13 can be used to verify whether a reaction is first order and to determine 
its rate constant. This equation has the form of the general equation for a straight line, 
y = mx + b, in which m is the slope and b is the y-intercept of the line (Appendix A.4):
