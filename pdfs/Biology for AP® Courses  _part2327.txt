ll, it was many years before it was proven that these “filterable”
infectious agents were not simply very small bacteria but were a new type of very small, disease-causing particle.
Virions, single virus particles, are very small, about 20–250 nanometers in diameter. These individual virus particles are the
infectious form of a virus outside the host cell. Unlike bacteria (which are about 100-times larger), we cannot see viruses
with a light microscope, with the exception of some large virions of the poxvirus family. It was not until the development of
the electron microscope in the late 1930s that scientists got their first good view of the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus
(TMV) (Figure 21.1) and other viruses (Figure 21.2). The surface structure of virions can be observed by both scanning
and transmission electron microscopy, whereas the internal structures of the virus can only be observed in images from a
transmission electron microscope. The use of these technologies has allo
