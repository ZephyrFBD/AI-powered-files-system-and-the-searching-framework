 in observed from expected is
due to chance, and there was no experimental error. Lucky you!
Reject the null hypothesis—If the chi-square value is greater than the
critical value, you must reject the null hypothesis, meaning the difference
between observed and expected is not due to chance, but is due to
experimental error. The error may have been due to a technical error in
carrying out the experiment or to some other factor that you failed to
consider when devising the experiment.
CHAPTER SUMMARY
Twenty-five percent of instructional time in AP Biology is supposed to be
devoted to hands-on laboratory work with an emphasis on inquiry-based
investigations. That’s a lot of time. Therefore, you can expect that lots of
questions on the AP exam will focus on inquiry-related skills outlined by
the 6 Science Practices. As you study these 13 labs, focus on the following
