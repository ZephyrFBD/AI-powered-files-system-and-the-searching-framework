ls were cultured for several generations, and the phenotypes were examined.
Results: The poky phenotype was observed in some of the cultured fungi.
(a) In mitochondrial inheritance the offspring have the genotype and phenotype of the mother. Under
Mendelian inheritance it is possible for the offspring to have a different genotype but the same phenotype as
the mother. Describe how this is possible.
(b) Explain what important control(s) the scientists should do to account for the procedure in Step 2.
(c) If the nuclear DNA was injected into the wild-type Neurospora cells instead of the mitochondria, explain
whether the resulting fungi would have the poky phenotype?
(d) Justify your prediction.
4. A diverse flock of finches that can eat many sizes of seeds lives on a small island in Polynesia, which recently
experienced a drought. Trees producing robust, medium-sized seeds died out in large numbers but more
resilient trees that produced both small and large-sized seeds are thriving. The f
