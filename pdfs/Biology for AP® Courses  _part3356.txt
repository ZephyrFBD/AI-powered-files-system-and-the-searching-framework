ergy. The hormones epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) and norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline)
are released by the adrenal medulla. How do these hormones provide a burst of energy? Epinephrine and norepinephrine
increase blood glucose levels by stimulating the liver and skeletal muscles to break down glycogen and by stimulating
glucose release by liver cells. Additionally, these hormones increase oxygen availability to cells by increasing the heart rate
and dilating the bronchioles. The hormones also prioritize body function by increasing blood supply to essential organs such
as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles, while restricting blood flow to organs not in immediate need, such as the skin,
digestive system, and kidneys. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are collectively called catecholamines.
