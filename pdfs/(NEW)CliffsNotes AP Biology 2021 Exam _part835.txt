eaction is the slope of the plotted curve at the beginning of the reaction. Since the straight
line portion of the curve from 0 to 2 seconds indicates a constant rate of reaction, the slope at any point along this
portion of the line will provide the initial rate. For the entire interval from 0 to 2 seconds, the slope, determined by
the change in product formed divided by the change in time, is
.
5. C. An enzyme that is heated to 100Â°C will be structurally damaged. As a result, the reaction, no longer under the
influence of the enzyme, is not likely to occur. If any activity persists, the reaction rate would be equivalent to the
same reaction in the absence of the enzyme (extremely slow).
6. C. Since enzyme-mediated reactions are reversible (they convert product back to substrate), increasing the
concentration of the product will slow the forward direction of the reaction and accelerate the reverse reaction.
Conversely, an increase in the substrate concentration will increase the forwa
