Color and Magnetism in 
Coordination Chemistry
Studies of the colors and magnetic properties of transition-metal complexes have played 
an important role in the development of modern models for metal–ligand bonding. 
We discussed the various types of magnetic behavior of the transition metals in Section 
23.1, and we discussed the interaction of radiant energy with matter in Section 6.3. Let’s 
briefly examine the significance of these two properties for transition-metal complexes 
before we develop a model for metal–ligand bonding.
Color
In Figure 23.4, we saw the diverse range of colors seen in salts of transition-metal ions 
and their aqueous solutions. In general, the color of a complex depends on the identity 
of the metal ion, on its oxidation state, and on the ligands bound to it. Figure 23.24, for 
instance, shows how the pale blue color characteristic of 3Cu(H2O)442+ changes to deep 
blue-violet as NH3 ligands replace the H2O ligands to form 3Cu(NH3)442+.
