Draw your hypothesis on Figure 4. 
Step 2 Locate and download gene files. Download three gene files from  
http://blogging4biology.edublogs.org/2010/08/28/college-board-lab-files/. 
Step 3 Upload the gene sequence into BLAST by doing the following: 
a. Go to the BLAST homepage: http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi 
b. Click on “Saved Strategies” from the   
menu at the top of the page.

c. Under “Upload Search Strategy,” click on “Browse” and locate one of the gene files 
you saved onto your computer. 
d. Click “View.”

e. A screen will appear with the parameters for your query already configured. 
NOTE: Do not alter any of the parameters. Scroll down the page and click on the 
“BLAST” button at the bottom.

f.  After collecting and analyzing all of the data for that particular gene (see 
instructions below), repeat this procedure for the other two gene sequences.
