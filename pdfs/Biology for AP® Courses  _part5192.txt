the bigger the lie the more will believe it. Cowan, however, wasn’t
ﬁnished and he went on to identify what he called the real
blockbuster in the paper. He quotes this section from a paper wriĴen
by virologists and published by the CDC and then explains what it
means:
Therefore, we examined the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and replicate in several
common primate and human cell lines, including human adenocarcinoma cells (A549),
human liver cells (HUH 7.0), and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T). In addition to
Vero E6 and Vero CCL81 cells. ... Each cell line was inoculated at high multiplicity of
infection and examined 24h post-infection.
No CPE was observed in any of the cell lines except in Vero cells, which grew to greater than
10 to the 7th power at 24 h post-infection. In contrast, HUH 7.0 and 293T showed only
modest viral replication, and A549 cells were incompatible with SARS CoV-2 infection.
Cowan explains that when virologists aĴempt to prove infection
they have th
