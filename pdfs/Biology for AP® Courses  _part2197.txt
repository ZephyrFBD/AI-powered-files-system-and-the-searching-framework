e founder effect is the Amish
population. The Amish population was
established from about 200 German immigrants.
Individuals of this founding population carried
gene mutations that cause inherited disorders
such as Ellis-van Creveld syndrome. This form
of dwarfism is found in a large concentration in
the Amish population today because the
immigrants that established the population had a
high concentration of the disorder in a very
small population.
b.
The founder effect is an event that kills off a
significant proportion of a population,
generating an allele frequency which is not
typical of the original population. An example of
the founder effect is the Northern elephant seal.
At one point, hunting of these seals had reduced
their numbers to less than 50 individuals. The
population has since rebounded, but still
contains less genetic variation than the related
Southern elephant seal due to the loss of some
alleles.

The founder effect is when only a few males
