hey respond quickly enough.
Ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI or GFI), described in Section 21–9, are
designed to protect people from the much lower currents (10 mA to 100 mA) that
are lethal but would not throw a 15-A circuit breaker or blow a 20-A fuse.
Another danger is leakage current, by which we mean a current along an
unintended path. Leakage currents are often “capacitively coupled.” For example,
a wire in a lamp forms a capacitor with the metal case; charges moving in one con-
ductor attract or repel charge in the other, so there is a current. Typical electrical
codes limit leakage currents to 1 mA for any device, which is usually harmless.
It could be dangerous, however, to a hospital patient with implanted electrodes,
due to the absence of the protective skin layer and because the current can 
pass directly through the heart. Although 100 mA may be needed to cause heart
fibrillation when entering through the hands and spreading out through the body
(very little of it a
