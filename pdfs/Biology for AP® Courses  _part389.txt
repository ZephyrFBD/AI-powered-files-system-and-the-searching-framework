by defining regions inside and outside the cell with
different concentrations of key molecules and net charge.
In addition to the membrane defining the cell boundary,
eukaryotic cells have internal membranes.
D. Explain how internal membranes significantly increase
the functional capacity of the cells of eukaryotes relative
to those of prokaryotes.
77. Proteins are polymers whose sub-components are
amino acids connected by peptide bonds. The carboxylic
acid carbon, O = C – OH, of one amino acid can form a
bond with the amine, NH2, of another amino acid. In the
formation of this peptide bond, the amine replaces the OH
to form O = C – NH2. The other product of this reaction is
water, H2O.

Amino acids can be synthesized in the laboratory from
simpler molecules of ammonia (NH3), water (H2O),
methane (CH4), and hydrogen (H2) if energy is provided
