, shows a graph of displacement x vs. time , as 
given by Eqs. 11–8. We can also find the velocity v as a function of time from 
Fig. 11–7a. For the position shown (red dot in Fig. 11–7a), the magnitude of v
is 
but 
points to the left, so 
Again setting
we have
(11;9)
Just after
the velocity is negative (points to the left) and remains so until
(corresponding to
radians). After 
until 
the
velocity is positive. The velocity as a function of time (Eq. 11–9) is plotted in 
Fig. 11–10b. From Eqs. 11–6b and 11–7,
For a given spring–mass system, the maximum speed 
is higher if the ampli-
tude is larger, and always occurs as the mass passes the equilibrium point.
Newton’s second law and Eqs.11–8 give us the acceleration as a function of time:
(11;10)
where the maximum acceleration is
Equation 11–10 is plotted in Fig. 11–10c. Because the acceleration of a SHO is not
constant, the equations for uniformly accelerated motion do not apply to SHM.
