ntrated the resulting solution. In 
chemistry we often need to express the concentrations of solutions quantitatively.
Molarity
Molarity (symbol M) expresses the concentration of a solution as the number of moles 
of solute in a liter of solution (soln):
 
Molarity =
moles solute
volume of solution in liters 
[4.31]
A 1.00 molar solution (written 1.00 M) contains 1.00 mol of solute in every liter of 
 
solution. Figure 4.15 shows the preparation of 0.250 L of a 1.00 M solution of CuSO4. The 
molarity of the solution is 10.250 mol CuSO42>10.250 L soln) = 1.00 M. Note that we use 
the abbreviation “soln” for “solution.”
In this chapter, you have been introduced to a great number of chem-
ical reactions. It’s not easy to get a “feel” for what happens when 
chemicals react. One goal of this textbook is to help you become 
more adept at predicting the outcomes of reactions. The key to gain-
ing this “chemical intuition” is to learn how to categorize reactions.
