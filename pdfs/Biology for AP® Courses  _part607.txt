Salmonella is one of the most common food borne illnesses. When salmonella bacteria are engulfed by a white blood
cell during phagocytosis, it secretes a protein that prevents the fusion of the encased bacteria with the lysosome of the
cell. What effect would this have?
a.
The bacteria will be destroyed and will not cause any illness.
b.
The bacteria will survive and will definitely result in illness.
c.
The bacteria will be destroyed, but will still cause illness.
d.
The bacteria will survive and possibly will cause illness.
Exocytosis
The reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis. Exocytosis is the opposite of the processes
discussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid. Waste material is enveloped
in a membrane and fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane. This fusion opens the membranous
