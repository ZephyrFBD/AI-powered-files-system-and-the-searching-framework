. Hadrons are
particles that interact via the strong nuclear force and are said to be strongly interacting
particles. They also interact via the other forces, but the strong force predominates
at short distances. The hadrons include the proton, neutron, pion, and many
other particles. They are divided into two subgroups: baryons, which are particles
that have baryon number 
(or 
in the case of their antiparticles) and, as we
shall see, are each made up of three quarks; and mesons, which have baryon
number
and are made up of a quark and an antiquark.
Only a few of the hundreds of hadrons (a veritable “zoo”) are included in
Table 32–2. Notice that the baryons 
and 
all decay to lighter-mass
baryons, and eventually to a proton or neutron. All these processes conserve
baryon number. Since there is no particle lighter than the proton with 
if baryon number is strictly conserved, the proton itself cannot decay and is
stable. (But see Section 32–11.) Note that Table 32–2 gives the mean life
