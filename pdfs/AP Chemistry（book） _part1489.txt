e multiple bonds and 
more than one resonance structure, such as C6H6, the p bonds are 
delocalized; that is, the p bonds are spread among several atoms.
MOLECULAR ORBITALS (SECTION 9.7) Molecular orbital theory is 
another model used to describe the bonding in molecules. In this 
model, the electrons exist in allowed energy states called molecular 
orbitals (MOs). An MO can extend over all the atoms of a molecule. 
Like an atomic orbital, a molecular orbital has a definite energy 
and can hold two electrons of opposite spin. We can build mo-
lecular orbitals by combining atomic orbitals on different atomic 
centers. In the simplest case, the combination of two atomic or-
bitals leads to the formation of two MOs, one at lower energy and 
one at higher energy relative to the energy of the atomic orbitals. 
 
The lower-energy MO concentrates charge density in the re-
gion between the nuclei and is called a bonding molecular or-
bital. The higher-energy MO excludes electrons from the regi
