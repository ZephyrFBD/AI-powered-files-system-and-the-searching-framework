 (eV) associated with this state?
62. (II) An excited hydrogen atom could, in principle, have a
radius of 1.00 cm. What would be the value of n for a Bohr
orbit of this size? What would its energy be?
63. (II) Is the use of nonrelativistic formulas justified in the
Bohr atom? To check, calculate the electron’s velocity, v,
in terms of c, for the ground state of hydrogen, and then
calculate
64. (III) Show that the magnitude of the electrostatic potential
energy of an electron in any Bohr orbit of a hydrogen atom
is twice the magnitude of its kinetic energy in that orbit.
65. (III) Suppose an electron was bound to a proton, as in the
hydrogen atom, but by the gravitational force rather than
by the electric force. What would be the radius, and energy,
of the first Bohr orbit?
