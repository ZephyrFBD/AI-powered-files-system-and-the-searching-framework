(b) What are the volumes in the two beakers when 
equilibrium is attained, assuming ideal behavior?
 13.102  The normal boiling point of ethanol, CH3CH2OH, is 
 
78.4 °C. When 9.15 g of a soluble nonelectrolyte is 
dissolved in 100.0 g of ethanol at that temperature, the va-
por pressure of the solution is 7.40 * 102 torr. What is the 
molar mass of the solute?
 13.103  Calculate the freezing point of a 0.100 m aqueous solution 
of K2SO4, (a) ignoring interionic attractions, and (b) tak-
ing interionic attractions into consideration by using the 
van’t Hoff factor (Table 13.4).
 13.104  Carbon disulfide 1CS22 boils at 46.30 °C and has a density 
of 1.261 g>mL. (a) When 0.250 mol of a nondissociating 
solute is dissolved in 400.0 mL of CS2, the solution boils at 
47.46 °C. What is the molal boiling-point-elevation con-
stant for CS2? (b) When 5.39 g of a nondissociating un-
known is dissolved in 50.0 mL of CS2, the solution boils at 
47.08 °C. What is the molar mass of the unknown?
