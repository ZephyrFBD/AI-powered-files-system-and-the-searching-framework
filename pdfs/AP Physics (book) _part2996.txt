The mass of the droplet was determined by measuring its terminal velocity in the
absence of the electric field. Often the droplet was charged negatively, but some-
times it was positive, suggesting that the droplet had acquired or lost electrons (by
friction, leaving the atomizer). Millikan’s painstaking observations and analysis pre-
sented convincing evidence that any charge was an integral multiple of a smallest
charge, e, that was ascribed to the electron, and that the value of e was
This value of e, combined with the measurement of 
gives the mass of the
electron to be 
This mass is
less than a thousandth the mass of the smallest atom, and thus confirmed the idea
that the electron is only a part of an atom. The accepted value today for the mass
of the electron is 
The experimental result that any charge is an integral multiple of e means that
electric charge is quantized (exists only in discrete amounts).
