se II, meiosis is concluded as cytokinesis separates the nuclei
into four haploid cells, each containing half the number of chromosomes of the original parent cell.
b. Meiosis is a reduction division that occurs in sexual reproduction. It halves the number of chromosomes so that
daughter cells are haploid. In humans, the daughter cells are the gametes, sperm and eggs, formed in the testes and
ovaries. Gametes fuse to form a diploid zygote, which then grows into a multicellular organism by mitotic divisions.
In other organisms, meiosis may produce haploid spores, which divide by mitosis to grow into multicellular haploid
organisms.
c. There are three points during meiosis and sexual reproduction where genetic material is rearranged to create
genetic variation. First, crossing over during metaphase I results in an exchange of genetic material between
nonsister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. Chromosomes, previously of either paternal or maternal origin,
now contain genetic material
