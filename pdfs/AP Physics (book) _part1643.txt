ors and air conditioners do work to accomplish the opposite: to make heat flow
from cold to hot. We might say they “pump” heat from cold areas to hotter areas,
against the natural tendency of heat to flow from hot to cold, just as water can 
be pumped uphill, against the natural tendency to flow downhill. The term 
heat pump is usually reserved for a device that can heat a house in winter by using
an electric motor that does work W to take heat 
from the outside at low tem-
perature and delivers heat 
to the warmer inside of the house; see Fig. 15–18.

Heat pump. A heat pump has a coefficient of performance
of 3.0 and is rated to do work at 1500 watts. (a) How much heat can it add to a
room per second? (b) If the heat pump were turned around to act as an air condi-
tioner in the summer, what would you expect its coefficient of per
