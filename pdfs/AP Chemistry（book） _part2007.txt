Imagine the primitive cubic lattice. Now imagine pushing 
on top of it, straight down. Next, stretch another face by 
pulling it to the right. All angles remain 90°. What kind of 
primitive lattice have you made?
atom in the unit cell. Do your answers correspond 
to the ratios expected from the empirical formulas: 
Ni3Al, Nb3Sn, and SmCo5?

Cinnabar (HgS) was utilized as a pigment known as ver-
million. It has a band gap of 2.20 eV near room tempera-
ture for the bulk solid. What wavelength of light (in nm) 
would a photon of this energy correspond to?

The electrical conductivity of aluminum is approximately 
109 times greater than that of its neighbor in the periodic 
table, silicon. Aluminum has a face-centered cubic struc-
ture, and silicon ha
