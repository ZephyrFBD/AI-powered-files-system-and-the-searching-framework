fic transcription factors attach to enhancers,
DNA binding sites that can be thousands of nucleotides upstream or downstream to the gene. There may be one or
more enhancers that are unique to a particular gene, and each of those enhancers may be specific to a different
timing of transcription or to a specific cell type. Because an enhancer may be quite a distance away from the gene it
influences, the DNA segment containing the enhancer (and bearing its specific transcription factor) folds such that it
can join the general transcription factors and RNA polymerase on the promoter.
Coactivators and mediators are additional proteins that contribute to the binding of transcription complex
components.
5. RNA processing, as discussed earlier in this chapter, can produce different mRNAs by slicing the primary RNA
transcript in different ways. This allows a single gene to encode proteins that are specific to the cell type or to its
developmental stage.
6. RNA interference (RNAi) refers to gene
