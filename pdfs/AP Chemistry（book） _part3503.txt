 ¬Cl bond enthalpy is only 242 kJ>mol. Because H2 has a strong 
bond, most reactions involving H2 are slow at room temperature. However, the molecule 
is readily activated by heat, irradiation, or catalysis. The activation generally produces 
hydrogen atoms, which are very reactive. Once H2 is activated, it reacts rapidly and exo-
thermically with a wide variety of substances.
Give It Some Thought
If H2 is activated to produce H+, what must the other product be?

CHAPTER 22 Chemistry of the Nonmetals
Hydrogen forms strong covalent bonds with many other elements, including oxy-
gen; the O ¬H bond enthalpy is 463 kJ>mol. The formation of the strong O ¬H bond 
makes hydrogen an effective reducing agent for many metal oxides. When H2 is passed 
over heated CuO, for example, copper is produced:
 
CuO1s2 + H21g2 ¡ Cu1s2 + H2O1g2 
[22.6]
When H2 is ignited in air, a vigorous reaction occurs, forming H2O. Air containing as 
little as 4% H2 by volume is potentially explosive. Combustion of
