is an example
of quorum sensing.
The marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri lives symbiotically inside a
variety of Hawaiian squid. The squid provide shelter and a stable source of
nutrients for the bacteria, which live in an enclosed light-emitting organ
within the squid’s body. The bacteria, in return, provide light
(bioluminescence) that benefits the squid. Through the process of quorum
sensing, the bacteria monitor the size of their population and produce light
when their population is large enough to be seen and effective. When the
V. fischeri population lights up the squid, the squid becomes camouflaged
and can feed without being attacked by predators.
How do the bacteria “know” when their population is large enough?
They release signaling molecules into their environment. As the bacteria
population increases, so does the concentration of signaling molecules
until there are enough molecules to bind to receptors inside or on the
surface of all the bacteria and trigger a cascade of chemi
