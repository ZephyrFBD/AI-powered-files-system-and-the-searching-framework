e carrying the appropriate amino acid base pairs with the codon
on the mRNA.
As new tRNA molecules match up to new codons, the ribosome holds them in place, allowing peptide bonds to
form between the amino acids.
The newly formed polypeptide grows until a stop codon is reached.
The polypeptide or protein folds up and is released into the cell.
At the Same Time!
In prokaryotes, transcription and translation can be occurring at the same time.
This is because prokaryotes lack a nucleus and their transcription and
translation are both occurring in the same place, the cytoplasm.
Gene Regulation
What controls gene transcription, and how does an organism express only certain genes? Regulation of gene
expression can occur at different times. The largest point is before transcription, or pre-transcriptional regulation.
It can also occur post-transcriptionally or post-translationally.
The start of transcription requires DNA to be unwound and RNA polymerase to bind at the promoter. The process is
