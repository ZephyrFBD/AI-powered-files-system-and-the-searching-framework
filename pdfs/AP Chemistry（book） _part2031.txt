interac-
tions with the ions, and these interactions do not compensate for the energies required 
to separate the ions from one another.
By similar reasoning, a polar liquid solute, such as water, does not dissolve in a non-
polar liquid solvent, such as octane 1C8H182. The water molecules experience strong 
hydrogen-bonding interactions with one another 
 (Section 11.2)—attractive forces 
that must be overcome if the water molecules are to be dispersed throughout the octane 
solvent. The energy required to separate the H2O molecules from one another is not 
recovered in the form of attractive interactions between the H2O and C8H18 molecules.
