 connection between the second law of thermodynamics and
the biosynthesis of macromolecules in a living cell?
Releasing water molecules in the biosynthesis of
macromolecules increases entropy.
(A)
The entropy of the surroundings increases as the cell
synthesizes macromolecules.
(B)
The entropy in the cell increases as it synthesizes
macromolecules.
(C)
The second law of thermodynamics does not apply to
biological systems.
(D)
3. The Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary coincides with a mass
extinction that led to the disappearance of more than three-
fourths of all plant and animal species living on Earth. One
popular hypothesis proposes that a large meteorite collided with
the Earth, sending large clouds of debris into the atmosphere that
blocked sunlight. How would such a catastrophic event most
likely have changed the levels of energy in the biosphere?
The clouds blocking the Sun caused a long period of cold
temperatures, which stopped energy flow.
