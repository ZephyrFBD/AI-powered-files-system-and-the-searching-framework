Populations of a plant that appears similar, with slight
differences, have been found in the same mountains at
altitudes below 2,300 meters.
Explain how the two types of data you suggested provide a
direct answer to the question of whether speciation has

taken place.
a.
If the plants become more similar when grown
in the same environment, or if the high-altitude
plants respond to low altitude in the same way
that low-altitude plants have, and low-altitude
plants respond to high altitude the same way that
high-altitude plants have, then the two groups
have the same underlying genetic structure and
belong to one species.
b.
If the seeds from the plants can be cross
fertilized and developed into fertile offspring,
the two populations are not yet reproductively
isolated and remain one species. If hybrid forms
are found, the two populations are not
reproductively isolated and hybrids are both
viable and successful.
c.
If the genetic co
