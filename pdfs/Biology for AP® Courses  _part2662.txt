kept at a pressure of 30–34 psi. An example of the effect of turgor
pressure is the wilting of leaves and their restoration after the plant has been watered (Figure 23.33). Water is lost from the

leaves via transpiration (approaching Ψp = 0 MPa at the wilting point) and restored by uptake via the roots.
A plant can manipulate Ψp via its ability to manipulate Ψs and by the process of osmosis. If a plant cell increases the
cytoplasmic solute concentration, Ψs will decline, Ψtotal will decline, the ΔΨ between the cell and the surrounding tissue
will decline, water will move into the cell by osmosis, and Ψp will increase. Ψp is also under indirect plant control via the
opening and closing of stomata. Stomatal openings allow water to evaporate from the leaf, reducing Ψp and Ψtotal of the leaf
and increasing ΔΨ between the water in the leaf and the petiole, thereby allowing water to flow from the petiole into the
leaf.
