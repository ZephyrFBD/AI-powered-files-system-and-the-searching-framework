Channel ecosystem the primary producers account for a biomass of 4 g/m2 (grams per meter
squared), while the primary consumers exhibit a biomass of 21 g/m2.
The productivity of the primary producers is especially important in any ecosystem because these organisms bring energy
to other living organisms by photoautotrophy or chemoautotrophy. The rate at which photosynthetic primary producers
incorporate energy from the sun is called gross primary productivity. An example of gross primary productivity is shown
in the compartment diagram of energy flow within the Silver Springs aquatic ecosystem as shown (Figure 37.8). In this
ecosystem, the total energy accumulated by the primary producers (gross primary productivity) was shown to be 20,810
kcal/m2/yr.
Because all organisms need to use some of this energy for their own functions (like respiration and resulting metabolic heat
loss) scientists often refer to the net primary productivity of an ecosystem. Net primary productivity is the energ
