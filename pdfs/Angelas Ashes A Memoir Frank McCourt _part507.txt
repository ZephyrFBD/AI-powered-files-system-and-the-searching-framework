ter than saying them to small ones in 
 
 memory of that sweet Patricia Madigan dead of the dipteria. 
 
 Good-bye, Francis. If I had the right fist I’d write to you but I’ll get 
 
 the wife to write when she comes over. I might even learn to read and 
 
 write myself so that the child that comes won’t have a fool for a father. 
 
 I want to cry but you can’t cry in the eye ward with brown stuff in 
 
 your eyes and nurses saying,What’s this what’s this be a man, and nuns 
 
 going on, Offer it up, think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, 
 
 the crown of thorns, the lance in the side, the hands and feet torn to bits 
 
 with nails. 
 
 I’m a month in the hospital and the doctor says I can go home even 
 
 if there’s still a bit of infection but if I keep the eyes clean with soap and 
 
 clean towels and build up my health with nourishing food plenty of 
 
 beef and eggs I’ll have a pair of sparkling eyes in no time ha ha.
