The dihybrid cross produces the famous phenotypic ratio of 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. If
you consider a large number of oﬀspring, there will be on average 9 out of
every 16 that express the dominant phenotypes for both genes, 3 out of
every 16 that express the dominant phenotype of one gene, 3 out of every
16 that express the dominant phenotype of the other gene, and only 1
out of every 16 that expresses the recessive phenotypes for both genes.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Notice patterns in the ratios that occur with specific types of
crosses. For example, crossing a heterozygous dominant (Rr) with
a homozygous recessive (rr) always gives a 1 : 1 ratio of dominant
to recessive phenotypes (half dominant phenotype; half recessive
phenotype). This can speed up the process of figuring out
phenotypic ratios and probabilities.
These are the basics of inheritance. However, genes do not operate in
isolation from one another;
