tion of the induced current in ab is from a toward b. And in the lower section,
it is from c to d; so the flow is continuous in the loop. The magnitude of the emf
generated in ab is given by Eq. 21–3, except that we must take the component 
of the velocity perpendicular to B:
where is the length of ab. From Fig. 21–17 we see that 
where is
the angle the loop’s face makes with the vertical. The emf induced in cd has the same
magnitude and is in the same direction. Therefore their emfs add, and the total emf is
where we have multiplied by N, the number of loops in the coil.
If the coil is rotating with constant angular velocity 
then the angle
