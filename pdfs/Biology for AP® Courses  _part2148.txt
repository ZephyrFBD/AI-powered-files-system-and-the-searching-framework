duals can cause genetic drift. For example, if several white rabbits migrate into a
population of mostly brown rabbits, the allele for white fur will increase within the population.
b.
Introduction of new alleles through mutation can cause genetic drift. For example, if there are two alleles for
fur color in a rabbit population, and a mutation in one of them produces a third allele, the gene pool changes
to incorporate the new allele.
c.
Chance events such as a natural disasters can cause genetic drift. For example, if the only white rabbits in a
population get killed by a storm, the allele for white fur will diminish or disappear in the population.
d.
Differential survival and reproduction can cause genetic drift. For example, if all the white rabbits in a
population get eaten by wolves because their white fur stands out and is more visible, the proportion of the
allele for white fur in the population will decrease.
Genetic drift can also be magnified by natural events, such as a natu
