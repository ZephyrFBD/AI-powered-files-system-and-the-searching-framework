ses only a single copy of a gene, which it
expresses (e.g., human males are hemizygous for X-linked traits)
heterotroph
An organism that must get its inorganic and organic raw materials from the
environment; a consumer
heterozygous
Describes an individual that possesses two contrasting alleles for a given
trait (e.g., Tt)
homeostasis
The dynamic process by which an organism maintains a stable internal

homozygous
Describes an individual that has the same gene for the same trait on each
homologous chromosome (e.g., TT or tt)
homozygous dominant

expressed in a heterozygous as well as a homozygous genotype
homozygous recessive
Having two recessive alleles of the same gene; recessive
