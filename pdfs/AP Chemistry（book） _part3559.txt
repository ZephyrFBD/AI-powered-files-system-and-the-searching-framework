unds in which phosphorus has a -3 oxidation state are much stron-
ger reducing agents than are the corresponding nitrogen compounds.
Some properties of the group 5A elements are listed in Table 22.7. The variation in 
properties among group 5A elements is more striking than that seen in groups 6A and 
7A. Nitrogen at the one extreme exists as a gaseous diatomic molecule, clearly nonmetal-
lic. At the other extreme, bismuth is a reddish white, metallic-looking substance that has 
most of the characteristics of a metal.
The values listed for X¬X single-bond enthalpies are not reliable because it is diffi-
cult to obtain such data from thermochemical experiments. However, there is no doubt 
about the general trend: a low value for the N¬N single bond, an increase at phosphorus, 
and then a gradual decline to arsenic and antimony. From observations of the elements
