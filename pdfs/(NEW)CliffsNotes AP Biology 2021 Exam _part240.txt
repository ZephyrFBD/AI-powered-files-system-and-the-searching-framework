the eight chromosomes would consist of four homologous pairs.
9. C. A gamete would possess four chromosomes, half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Also, these
four chromosomes would consist of one member of each pair of homologous chromosomes. Figure B also has four
chromosomes, but it does not present one homologue of each homologous pair.
10. B. Homologous chromosomes pair (synapsis) during prophase I and form chiasmata. Exchanges of genetic
material occur within chiasmata.
11. A. There are generally no events during normal mitosis that would produce genetic differences between the two
daughter cells. The daughter cells are clones, genetically identical. In contrast, the independent assortment of
homologues during anaphase I, the random union of egg and sperm during fertilization, and crossing over during
prophase I all contribute to genetic variation.
12. C. At the end of meiosis I, each daughter cell would have two chromosomes, each comprised of two chromatids.
