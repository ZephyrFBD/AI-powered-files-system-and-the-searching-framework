 require energy or release energy.
The study of how cells accomplish biological processes is called bioenergetics.
Chemical reactions are catalyzed by enzymes.
Enzymes lower the activation energy of chemical reactions by stabilizing the transition state.
Enzymes do not change the energy difference between reactants and products, but by lowering the activation
energy, they facilitate chemical reactions to occur.
Enzymes are proteins that are highly specific for their substrate (or reactant, which binds at the active site).
Enzymes have an optimal, narrow range of temperature and pH in which they have the highest rate of reaction.
Outside this range, they may undergo denaturation and, therefore, no longer be active.
Enzyme activity may also be regulated or altered by allosteric/noncompetitive inhibitors, competitive inhibitors,
and activators.
Enzymes may require coenzymes or cofactors to help catalyze reactions.
ATP is the universal energy molecule in cells. It is created via cellular r
