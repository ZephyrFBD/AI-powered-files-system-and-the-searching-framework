Give It Some Thought
In the crystal structure of potassium oxide, the oxide ions are coordinated by eight 
potassium ions. What is the coordination number of potassium?
Rubidium iodide crystallizes with the same structure as sodium chloride. (a) How many iodide ions are there per unit cell?  
(b) How many rubidium ions are there per unit cell? (c) Use the ionic radii and molar masses of Rb+ 11.66 Å, 85.47 g>mol2 and 
I-12.06 Å, 126.90 g >mol2 to estimate the density of rubidium iodide in g>cm3.
