ergy is
used to do work by the cell, usually by the released phosphate binding to another molecule, activating it. For example, in
the mechanical work of muscle contraction, ATP supplies the energy to move the contractile muscle proteins. Recall the
active transport work of the sodium-potassium pump in cell membranes. ATP alters the structure of the integral protein that
functions as the pump, changing its affinity for sodium and potassium. In this way, the cell performs work, pumping ions
against their electrochemical gradients.
ATP Structure and Function
At the heart of ATP is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which is composed of an adenine molecule bonded
to a ribose molecule and to a single phosphate group (Figure 7.3). The addition of a second phosphate group to this core
molecule results in the formation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP); the addition of a third phosphate group forms adenosine
triphosphate (ATP).
Figure 7.3 ATP (adenosine triphosphate) has three phosphat
