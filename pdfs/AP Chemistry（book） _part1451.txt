r would the molecule fall apart?
antibonding MO.* Because He2 has two bonding electrons and two antibonding electrons, 
it has a bond order of 0. A bond order of 0 means that no bond exists. Molecular orbital the-
ory correctly predicts that hydrogen forms diatomic molecules but helium does not.

Molecular Orbitals for Li2 and Be2
Lithium has the electron configuration 1s22s1. When lithium metal is heated above its 
boiling point 11342 °C2, Li2 molecules are found in the vapor phase. The Lewis structure 
for Li2 indicates a Li ¬Li single bond. We will now use MOs to describe the bonding in Li2.
Figure 9.35 shows that the Li 1s and 2s atomic orbitals have substantially different 
energy levels. From this, we can assume that the 1s orbital on one Li atom interacts only 
with the 1s orbital on the other atom (rule 2). Likewise, the 2s orbitals interact only with 
each other. Notice that combining four atomic orbitals produces four MOs
