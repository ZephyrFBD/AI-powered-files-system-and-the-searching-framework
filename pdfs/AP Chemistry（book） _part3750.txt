to the equilibrium-constant expres-
sion, and solving for x, we obtain 4 * 10-9 M. From this, we 
see that the oxalate has complexed all but a tiny fraction of 
the Co2+ in solution.
x = 4 * 10-9 M
Chapter Summary and Key Terms
THE TRANSITION METALS (SECTION 23.1) Metallic elements are 
obtained from minerals, which are solid inorganic compounds found 
in nature. Metallurgy is the science and technology of extracting met-
als from the earth and processing them for further use. Transition 
metals are characterized by incomplete filling of the d orbitals. The 
presence of d electrons in transition elements leads to multiple oxi-
dation states. As we proceed through the transition metals in a given 
row of the periodic table, the attraction between the nucleus and the 
valence electrons increases more markedly for d electrons than for s 
electrons. As a result, the later transition elements in a period tend to 
have lower oxidation states.
The atomic and ionic radii of period 5 transition
