at
the synaptic membrane was shown to increase with the
experience.
A miniaturized device, optically activated and controlled
by flashing light, was inserted in the nuclei of neurons
transmitting the tone to the ratâ€™s brain. When the
experimenters used light with 1 flash per second (1 Hz) the
device caused the expression by the cell of one type of
protein and when a light with 100 flashes per second (100
Hz) was used the device caused expression of another type
of protein. Each of the graphs describe the response of the
rat to environmental cues. One day elapsed between each
data collection represented by one graph.

for synaptic plasticity.
A third explanation for the formation of memory and
learning is found in the lab of David Glanzman (Elife,
2014). The sea slug (Aplysia) can be trained to withdraw
its siphon tube. Sensory and motor neurons can be grown
in tissue culture. The addition of serotonin to the tissue
