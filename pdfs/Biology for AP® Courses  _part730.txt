nucleotides is controlled through feedback inhibition. Additionally, ATP is an
allosteric regulator of some of the enzymes involved in the catabolic breakdown of sugar, the process that produces ATP.
In this way, when ATP is abundant, the cell can prevent its further production. Remember that ATP is an unstable molecule
that can spontaneously dissociate into ADP. If too much ATP were present in a cell, much of it would go to waste. On the
other hand, ADP serves as a positive allosteric regulator (an allosteric activator) for some of the same enzymes that are
inhibited by ATP. Thus, when relative levels of ADP are high compared to ATP, the cell is triggered to produce more ATP
through the catabolism of sugar.
Section Summary
Enzymes are chemical catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions at physiological temperatures by lowering their activation
energy. Enzymes are usually proteins consisting of one or more polypeptide chains. Enzymes have an active site that
provides a unique chemica
