on 4.4 that the reactant cations exchange anions—Mg2+ ends up with 
OH-, and Na+ ends up with NO3
-. The chemical formulas of the products are based on 
the charges of the ions—two OH- ions are needed to give a neutral compound with Mg2+, 
and one NO3
- ion is needed to give a neutral compound with Na+. 
(Section 2.7) The equa-
tion can be balanced only after the chemical formulas of the products have been determined.

CHAPTER 4 Reactions in Aqueous Solution
Reactions in which cations and anions appear to exchange partners conform to the 
general equation
 
 AX + BY ¡ AY + BX  
[4.5]
Example:  
 AgNO31aq2 + KCl1aq2 ¡ AgCl1s2 + KNO31aq2
Such reactions are called either exchange reactions or metathesis reactions (meh-
TATH-eh-sis, Greek for “to transpose”). Precipitation reactions conform to this pattern, as 
do many neutralization reactions between acids and bases, as we will see in Section 4.3.
How To Balance a Metathesis Reaction
 
1. Use the chemical formulas of the reactants to
