 (a)   
Use the values of Ka and Kb to estimate the equilibrium 
constant for the intramolecular proton transfer to form 
a zwitterion:

 (b)  
What is the pH of a 0.050 M aqueous solution of glycine?
 
 (c)   
What would be the predominant form of glycine in a 
solution with pH 13? With pH 1?
 16.115  The pKb of water is _______.
 
 (a) 1  (b) 7  (c) 14  (d) not defined  (e) none of the above

Many moderately large organic molecules containing basic 
nitrogen atoms are not very soluble in water as neutral mol-
ecules, but they are frequently much more soluble as their 
acid salts. Assuming that pH in the stomach is 2.5, indicate 
whether each of the following compounds would be pres-
ent in the stomach as the neutral base or in the protonated 
form: nicotine, Kb = 7 * 10-7; caffeine, Kb = 4 * 10-14; 
strychnine, Kb = 1 * 10-6; quinine, Kb = 1.1 * 10-6.
