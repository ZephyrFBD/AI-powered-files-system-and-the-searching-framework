membranes and cell walls for the movement of ions, amino acids, sugars, small proteins (including transcription
factors), and micoRNA (miRNA). Transcription factors and microRNA regulate gene expression. (Details are in
Chapter 9, “Molecular Biology.”)
2. Synaptic signaling occurs between junctions of nerve cells or between nerve and muscle cells.
Neurotransmitters , short-lived chemical signals, cross a very small space between these cells to stimulate or
inhibit a nerve impulse or muscle contraction.
3. Paracrine signaling is a mechanism for local communication. Cells secrete substances that affect only nearby
cells because the substances are either readily absorbed by adjacent cells or rapidly broken down in the extracellular
fluid. Growth factors, for example, are paracrine signals secreted during early animal development.
4. Endocrine signaling provides a mechanism for distributing signals throughout a multicellular organism. For
example, hormones produced in one part of
