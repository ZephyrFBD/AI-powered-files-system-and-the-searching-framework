ure 22.6 HF is the 
most stable, SbH3 the least stable. Figure 22.8 More soluble in 
CCl4 — the colors are deeper. Figure 22.9 CF2 Figure 22.12  
No Figure 22.14 Based on this structure—yes, it would have a 
dipole moment. In fact, if you look it up, hydrogen peroxide’s dipole 
moment is larger than water’s! Figure 22.19 Formally they could 
both be +2. If we consider that the central sulfur is like SO4
 2-, how-
ever, then the central sulfur would be +6, like SO4
 
2-, and the termi-
nal sulfur would be -2. Figure 22.21 Nitrite Figure 22.22  
Longer. (There is a triple bond in N2.) Figure 22.24 The NO 
double bond Figure 22.26 In both compounds the electron 
domains around the P atoms are tetrahedral. In P4O10 all the electron 
domains around the P atoms are bonding. In P4O6 one of the elec-
tron domains about each P atom is nonbonding. Figure 22.31  
The minimum temperature should be the melting point of silicon; 
the temperature of the heating coil should not be so high that the
