omes negatively charged. The charged forms of the atoms are called ions. An ionic bond results
from the attraction between the two oppositely charged ions. For example, when Na reacts with Cl, the charged ions
Na+ and Clâ€“ are formed.
A covalent bond is formed when electrons are shared between atoms. If the electrons are shared equally between the
atoms, the bond is called nonpolar covalent. If the electrons are shared unequally, the bond is called polar
covalent. When one pair of electrons is shared between two atoms, the result is a single covalent bond. When two
pairs of electrons are shared, the result is a double covalent bond. When three pairs of electrons are shared, the result
is a triple covalent bond.
WATER: THE VERSATILE MOLECULE
One of the most important substances in nature is water. Water is considered a unique molecule because it plays an
important role in chemical reactions.
