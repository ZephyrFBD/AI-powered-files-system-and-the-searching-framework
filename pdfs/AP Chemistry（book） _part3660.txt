The Development of Coordination Chemistry:  
Wernerâ€™s Theory
Because compounds of the transition metals are beautifully colored, the chemistry of 
these elements fascinated chemists even before the periodic table was introduced. During 
the late 1700s through the 1800s, the many coordination compounds that were isolated 
and studied had properties that were puzzling in light of the bonding theories prevailing 
at the time. Table 23.3, for example, lists a series of CoCl39NH3 compounds that have 
strikingly different colors. Note that the third and fourth species have different colors, 
even though the originally assigned formula was the same for both, CoCl3 # 4 NH3.
The modern formulations of the compounds in Table 23.3 are based on various 
lines of experimental evidence. For example, all four compounds are strong electrolytes 
 (Section 4.1) but yield different numbers of ions when dissolved in water. Dissolv-
ing CoCl3 # 6 NH3 in water yields four ions per
