ria following exposure to autoinducers can be quite extensive. The pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa
has 616 different genes that respond to autoinducers.

Figure 9.17 Autoinducers are small molecules or proteins produced by bacteria that regulate gene expression.
Which of the following statements about quorum sensing is false?
a.
Autoinducers must bind to receptors to turn on transcription of genes responsible for the production of more
autoinducers.
b.
Autoinducers can only act on a different cell. It cannot act on the cell in which it is made.
c.
Autoinducers turn on genes that enable the bacteria to form a biofilm.
d.
The receptor stays in the bacterial cell, but the autoinducers diffuse out.
Some species of bacteria that use quorum sensing form biofilms, complex colonies of bacteria (often containing several
species) that exchange chemical signals to coordina
