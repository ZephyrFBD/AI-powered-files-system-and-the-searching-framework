incapable of synthesizing and displaying MHC I molecules appropriately.
The metabolic resources of cells infected by some viruses produce proteins that interfere with MHC I processing and/
or trafficking to the cell surface. The reduced MHC I on host cells varies from virus to virus and results from active
inhibitors being produced by the viruses. This process can deplete host MHC I molecules on the cell surface, which NK
cells detect as “unhealthy” or “abnormal” while searching for cellular MHC I molecules. Similarly, the dramatically altered
gene expression of tumor cells leads to expression of extremely deformed or absent MHC I molecules that also signal
“unhealthy” or “abnormal.”
NK cells are always active; an interaction with normal, intact MHC I molecules on a healthy cell disables the killing
sequence, and the NK cell moves on. After the NK cell detects an infected or tumor cell, its cytoplasm secretes granules
comprised of perforin, a destructive protein that creates a pore in
