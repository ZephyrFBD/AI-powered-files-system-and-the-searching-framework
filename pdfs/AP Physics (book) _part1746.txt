that object. In applying Coulomb’s law, we can deal with charge magnitudes only
(leaving out minus signs) to get the magnitude of each force. Then determine
separately the direction of the force physically (along the line joining the two
particles: like charges repel, unlike charges attract), and show the force on the
diagram. (You could determine direction first if you like.) Finally, add all the forces
on one object together as vectors to obtain the net force on that object.
Three charges in a line. Three charged particles are
arranged in a line, as shown in Fig. 16–19a. Calculate the net electrostatic force
on particle 3 (the 
on the right) due to the other two charges.
APPROACH The net force on particle 3 is the vector sum of the force 
exerted on particle 3 by particle 1 and the force 
exerted on 3 by particle 2:
SOLUTION The magnitudes of these two forces are obtained using Coulomb’s
law, Eq. 16–1:
where 
is the distance from 
to 
Similarly,
Since we were calculating the magnitud
