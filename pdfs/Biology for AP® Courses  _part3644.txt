is calculated using which
formula?
a.
residual volume + tidal volume + inspiratory
reserve volume
b.
residual volume + expiratory reserve volume +
inspiratory reserve volume
c.
expiratory reserve volume + tidal volume +
inspiratory reserve volume
d.
residual volume + expiratory reserve volume +
tidal volume + inspiratory reserve volume
7. Why is the partial pressure of oxygen lower in the lung
than in the external air?
a.
Oxygen is constantly being removed by air in
the lungs through the blood.
b.
Carbon dioxide does not mix with oxygen in the
lung.
c.
The lungs exert pressure on the air to reduce the
oxygen pressure.
d.
Changes in water vapor pressure cause less
oxygen to enter the air in the lungs.
8. How can a decrease in the percent of oxygen in the air
affect the movement of oxygen in the body?

a.
It would not affect the rate of diffusion into the
blood because there would be no difference
between the partial pressures of the air and
blood.
