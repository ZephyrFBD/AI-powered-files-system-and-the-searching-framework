 (a) How many of these compounds exhibit dispersion in-
teractions? (b) How many of these compounds exhibit 
dipole-dipole interactions? (c) How many of these com-
pounds exhibit hydrogen bonding? (d) Why is the boiling 
point of bromobenzene higher than that of chlorobenzene? 
(e) Why is the boiling point of phenol the highest of all?
 11.79  The DNA double helix (Figure 24.30) at the atomic level 
looks like a twisted ladder, where the “rungs” of the ladder 
consist of molecules that are hydrogen-bonded together. 
Sugar and phosphate groups make up the sides of the lad-
der. Shown are the structures of the adenine–thymine (AT) 
“base pair” and the guanine–cytosine (GC) base pair:

 (a) Which of the two isomers will have the stronger dipole– 
dipole forces? (b) One isomer has a boiling point of 60.3 °C 
and the other 47.5 °C. Which isomer has which boiling 
point?
