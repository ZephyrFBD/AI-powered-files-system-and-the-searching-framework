cause of adhesion. Heat of
vaporization is the amount of energy required to
convert liquid into gas. This property helps
humans maintain homeostasis of body
temperature by evaporation.
c.
Cohesion is the attraction between the water
molecules, which helps create surface tension.
Insects can walk on water because of cohesion.
Adhesion is the attraction between water
molecules and other molecules. Water moving
up from the roots of plants to the leaves as a
result of capillary action is because of adhesion.
