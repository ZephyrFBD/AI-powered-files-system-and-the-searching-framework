2, and the iron oxides 1Fe2O3, Fe3O42 are obvi-
ous examples. Indeed, oxygen is the most abundant element by mass both in Earth’s 
crust and in the human body. 
 (Section 1.2) It is the oxidizing agent for the metabo-
lism of our foods and is crucial to human life.
Properties of Oxygen
Oxygen has two allotropes, O2 and O3. When we speak of molecular oxygen or simply 
oxygen, it is usually understood that we are speaking of dioxygen 1O22, the normal form 
of the element; O3 is ozone.
At room temperature, dioxygen is a colorless and odorless gas. Dioxygen is only 
slightly soluble in water (0.04 g>L, or 0.001 M at 25 °C), but its presence in water is essen-
tial to marine life.
The electron configuration of the oxygen atom is 3He42s22p4. Thus, oxygen can com-
plete its octet of valence electrons either by picking up two electrons to form the oxide ion 
1O2 -2 or by sharing two electrons. In its covalent compounds, it tends to form either two 
single bonds, as in H2O, or a double bond, as
