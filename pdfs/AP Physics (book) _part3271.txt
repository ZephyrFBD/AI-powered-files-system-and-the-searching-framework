Light is absorbed by the electrons in a material. Silicon’s energy gap is small
enough to absorb these photons, thus bumping electrons well up into the con-
duction band, so silicon is opaque. On the other hand, zinc sulfide’s energy gap
is so large that no visible-light photons would be absorbed; they would pass
right through the material which would thus be transparent.
