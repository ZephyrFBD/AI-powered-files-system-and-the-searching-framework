a.
New traits appear through gene mutations or
through genetic drift. In order to reach a steady,
high frequency in the population, there must be
many mutagens, such as UV radiation, in the
environment to produce many mutations.
b.
New traits appear through gene mutations or
through genetic drift. In order to reach a steady,
high frequency in the population, there must be a
consistent source of immigrant individuals with
the allele.
c.
New traits appear through gene mutations or
through evolution. In order to reach a steady,
high frequency in the population, the allele must
code for a favorable adaptation.
d.
New traits appear through gene mutations or
through gene flow. In order to reach a steady,
high frequency in the population, the trait
associated with the gene must be favored by
either natural or sexual selection.
20. Define and identify an example of population
variation.
