Desmosomes, which allow two cells to become attached
using intermediate filaments found in the cytoplasm of each
cell, anchor cells that are exposed to high levels of shear
stress, such as those in the heart.
(A)
Tight junctions, which form a total barrier between adjacent
cells, such as those found in the intestines, prevent important
nutrients from diﬀusing into areas where they should not be.
(B)
Anchoring junctions, which are found between cells that
experience a large amount of stress such as epithelial cells in
the skin, do not actually link cytoplasm, but rather physically
join cells so they do not separate.
(C)
Connexins, a type of protein used to build pores between
adjacent cells, allow cells to exchange ions and other
material.
(D)
of an α cell nearby, it will immediately halt current and future mitosis and
begin to prepare itself to mate with the α cell.
Scientists researching this phenomenon discovered that this occurs as a
result of a 13-amino-acid peptide known as α-fact
