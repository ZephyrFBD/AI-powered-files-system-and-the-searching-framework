Car ignition system
Cell phone charger. The charger for a cell phone contains a
transformer that reduces 120-V (or 240-V) ac to 5.0-V ac to charge the 3.7-V
battery (Section 19–4). (It also contains diodes to change the 5.0-V ac to 5.0-V dc.)
Suppose the secondary coil contains 30 turns and the charger supplies 700 mA.
Calculate (a) the number of turns in the primary coil, (b) the current in the
primary, and (c) the power transformed.
APPROACH We assume the transformer is ideal, with no flux loss, so we can use
Eq. 21–6 and then Eq. 21–7.
SOLUTION (a) This is a step-down transformer, and from Eq. 21–6 we have
(b) From Eq. 21–7
(c) The power transformed is
NOTE The power in the primary coil,
is the
same as the power in the secondary coil. There is 100% efficiency in power
transfer for our ideal transformer.
