rictionless surface is
attached to one end of a spring; the other end is fixed to 
a wall. It takes 3.6 J of work to compress the spring by
0.13 m. If the spring is compressed, and the mass is released
from rest, it experiences a maximum acceleration of
Find the value of (a) the spring constant and (b) the
mass.
20. (II) An object with mass 2.7 kg is executing simple har-
monic motion, attached to a spring with spring constant
When the object is 0.020 m from its equi-
librium position, it is moving with a speed of 
(a) Calculate the amplitude of the motion. (b) Calculate
the maximum speed attained by the object.
21. (II) At
an 885-g mass at rest on the end of a hori-
zontal spring
is struck by a hammer which
gives it an initial speed of 
Determine (a) the
period and frequency of the motion, (b) the amplitude,
(c) the maximum acceleration, (d) the total energy, and 
(e) the kinetic energy when
where A is the
amplitude.
