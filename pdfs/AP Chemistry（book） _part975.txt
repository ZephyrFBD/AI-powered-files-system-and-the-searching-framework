d by the bracketed symbol as the noble-gas core 
of the atom. More usually, these inner-shell electrons are referred to as the core elec-
trons. The electrons given after the noble-gas core are called the outer-shell electrons. 
The outer-shell electrons include the electrons involved in chemical bonding, which are 
called the valence electrons. For the elements with atomic number of 30 or less, all 
of the outer-shell electrons are valence electrons. By comparing the condensed electron 
configurations of lithium and sodium, we can appreciate why these two elements are so 
similar chemically. They have the same type of electron configuration in the outermost 
occupied shell. Indeed, all the members of the alkali metal group (1A) have a single s 
valence electron beyond a noble-gas configuration (Figure 6.29).
Transition Metals
The noble-gas element argon 11s22s22p63s23p62 marks the end of the row started by 
sodium. The element following argon in the periodic table is potassium (K), at
