 to be
dissociation of the fibers, eliminating (B).
2.
C
The synthesis, or S phase, of the cell cycle represents the step in which the genetic material is duplicated. The
only phase labeled in the experiment that represents an increase is phase B. Based on the time scale on the x-
axis, this phase lasts approximately 30 minutes.
3.
D
Anaphase represents the cell division stage of the cell cycle and would be the phase that occurs right before the
amount of genetic material should decrease. Phase D is the phase right before the genetic material would drop,
so (D) is the correct answer.
4.
D
Choices (A) and (B) do not occur, but if they did, they would not impact the gametes. Choice (C) is not likely
to occur because the mitotic spindles attach only to kinetochore protein complexes at the centromere.
Therefore, (D) is the answer.
5.
B
Both (A) and (B) have sperm or ovum as the first type of cell. Because these are both gametes, they will both
have half of the DNA of other types of cells.
