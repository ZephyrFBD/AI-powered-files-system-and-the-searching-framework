oduce the required torque? (b) What is the back emf?
(c) How much power is dissipated in the coils? (d) What
percent of the input power is used to drive the car? [Hint:
Check Sections 6–10, 18–5, 20–9, 20–10, and 21–6.]
4. Explain the advantage of using ac rather than dc current
when electric power needs to be transported long distances.

5. A power line carrying a sinusoidally varying current with
frequency 
and peak value 
runs at
a height of 7.0 m across a farmer’s land (Fig. 21–66).
The farmer constructs a vertical 2.0-m-high 2000-turn 
rectangular wire coil below the power line. The farmer
hopes to use the induced voltage in this coil to power
120-V electrical equipment, which requires a sinusoidally
varying voltage with frequency 
and peak value
Estimate the length of the coil needed. Would
this be stealing? [Hint: Consider 
over one-quarter of
a cycle 
See Sections 20–5 and 18–7.]
