just described and for complete combustion of the equiv-
alent amount of methanol, as calculated in part (a). 
 
(c) Methane, when liquefied, has a density of 0.466 g>mL; 
the density of methanol at 25 °C is 0.791 g>mL. Compare 
the enthalpy change upon combustion of a unit volume of 
liquid methane and liquid methanol. From the standpoint 
of energy production, which substance has the higher en-
thalpy of combustion per unit volume?

Gaseous iodine pentafluoride, IF5, can be prepared by the 
reaction of solid iodine and gaseous fluorine:
 
 
I21s2 + 5 F21g2 ¡ 2 IF51g2
A 5.00-L flask containing 10.0 g of I2 is charged with 
10.0 g of F2, and the reaction proceeds until one of 
the reagents is completely
