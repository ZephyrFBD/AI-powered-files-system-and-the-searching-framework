ational motion of the CM, plus rotational, vibrational, or other types of motion
about the CM.
As an example, consider the motion of the center of mass of the diver in 
Fig. 7–20; the CM follows a parabolic path even when the diver rotates, as shown
in Fig. 7–20b. This is the same parabolic path that a projected particle follows
when acted on only by the force of gravity (projectile motion, Chapter 3).
Other points in the rotating diver’s body, such as her feet or head, follow more
complicated paths.

Linear Momentum
only an x axis.) It is often convenient to choose the
axis in the direction of one object’s initial velocity.
5. Apply the momentum conservation equation(s):
You have one equation for each component (x, y, z):
only one equation for a head-on collision. [Don’t for-
get that it is the total momentum of the system that
is conserved, not the momenta of individual objects.]
6. If the collision is elastic, you can also write down a
conservation of kinetic energy equ
