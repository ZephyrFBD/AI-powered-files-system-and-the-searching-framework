nucleus is still maintained in red blood cells.
The red coloring of blood comes from the iron-containing protein hemoglobin, illustrated in Figure 31.6a. The principal job
of this protein is to carry oxygen, but it also transports carbon dioxide as well. Hemoglobin is packed into red blood cells at
a rate of about 250 million molecules of hemoglobin per cell. Each hemoglobin molecule binds four oxygen molecules so
that each red blood cell carries one billion molecules of oxygen. There are approximately 25 trillion red blood cells in the
five liters of blood in the human body, which could carry up to 25 sextillion (25 Ã— 1021) molecules of oxygen in the body at
any time. In mammals, the lack of organelles in erythrocytes leaves more room for the hemoglobin molecules, and the lack
of mitochondria also prevents use of the oxygen for metabolic respiration. Only mammals have anucleated red blood cells,
and some mammals (camels, for instance) even have nucleated red blood cells. The advantage
