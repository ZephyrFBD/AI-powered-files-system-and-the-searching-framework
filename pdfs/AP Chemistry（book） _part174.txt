kilogram, and exactly 2.54 cm in an inch. The 
number 1 in any conversion factor, such as 1 m = 100 cm or 1 kg = 2.2046 lb, is an exact 
number. Exact numbers can also result from counting objects. For example, we can count 
the exact number of marbles in a jar or the exact number of people in a classroom.
Numbers obtained by measurement are always inexact. The equipment used to 
measure quantities always has inherent limitations (equipment errors), and there are 
differences in how different people make the same measurement (human errors). Sup-
pose ten students with ten balances are to determine the mass of the same dime. The 
ten measurements will probably vary slightly for various reasons. The balances might 
be calibrated slightly differently, and there might be differences in how each student 
reads the mass from the balance. Remember: Uncertainties always exist in measured 
quantities.
