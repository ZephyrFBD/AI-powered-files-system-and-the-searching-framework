Reflection from still water, as from
a glass mirror, can be analyzed using
the ray model of light.
Is this picture right side up, or
upside down? How can you tell?
What are the clues? Notice the
people and position of the Sun.
Ray diagrams, which we will learn to
draw in this Chapter, can provide
the answer. See Example 23–3.
In this first Chapter on light and
optics, we use the ray model of light
to understand the formation of
images by mirrors, both plane and
curved (spherical). We also study
refractio
