34. What is a likely reason to explain why vertebrate
animals evolved an adaptive immune system rather than an
innate system involving specific responses to specific

a.
An adaptive immune system requires an
immense amount of information to be stored,
which allows vertebrate cells to be able to mount
specific responses to every pathogen.
b.
As new pathogens evolve all the time, it is more
conservative of energy and information storage
to have an adaptive immune system that can
respond to same pathogen
