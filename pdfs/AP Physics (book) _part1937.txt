81. A 
point charge is placed 36 cm from an identical
charge. A 
charge is moved from point A
to point B as shown in Fig. 17–47. What is the change in
potential energy?

84. A 
charge is 23 cm to the right of a 
charge.
At the midpoint between the two charges, (a) determine the
potential and (b) the electric field.
85. A parallel-plate capacitor with plate area 
and air-
gap separation 0.50 mm is connected to a 12-V battery, and
fully charged. The battery is then disconnected. (a) What is
the charge on the capacitor? (b) The plates are now pulled
to a separation of 0.75 mm. What is the charge on the
capacitor now? (c) What is the potential difference between
the plates now? (d) How much work was required to pull
the plates to their new separation?
86. A 
capacitor is fully charged by a 6.0-V battery. The
battery is then disconnected. The capacitor is not ideal and
the charge slowly leaks out from the
