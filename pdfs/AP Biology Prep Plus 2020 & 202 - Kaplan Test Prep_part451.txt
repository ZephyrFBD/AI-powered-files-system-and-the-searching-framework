omatic cells, the cell cycle consists of the three stages of interphase,
followed by mitosis, as shown in the following figure.
11.1 Describe the three phases of interphase
Most somatic cells spend about 90 percent of the cell cycle in interphase.
Interphase begins with G1, the first gap phase, in which the cell grows and
synthesizes RNA, proteins, and organelles. Aȇer suﬀicient growth has
occurred, the cell passes the G1 checkpoint and proceeds to the next
phase. During the S phase, the synthesis phase, DNA replication occurs.
Before replication, each chromosome in the cell consists of a single
chromatid but, aȇer replication, each consists of two identical sister
chromatids, attached at the centromere. Next comes G2, the second gap
phase, in which the cell continues to grow and synthesize more proteins.
Aȇer the cell grows enough to pass the G2 checkpoint, it will then proceed
on to the phases of mitosis.
