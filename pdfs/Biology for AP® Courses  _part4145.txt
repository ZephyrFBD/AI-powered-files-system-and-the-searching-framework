 cells and germ layers
originate from the blastocoel present inside the
blastula.
57. What determines whether a zygote will undergo total
or partial cleavage?
a.
Total cleavage takes place in eggs having a large
amount of yolk, whereas partial cleavage occurs
in eggs having very little or no yolk.
b.
Total cleavage occurs when eggs possess equal
concentration of yolk at both poles, whereas
partial cleavage occurs when the yolk is not
equally distributed.
c.
Total cleavage takes place in eggs having little
or no yolk, whereas partial cleavage occurs in
eggs having a large amount of yolk.
d.
Total cleavage occurs when divisions of the
blastomeres are separate, whereas partial
cleavage occurs when blastomeres stay partially
connected.
58. During organogenesis, the ectoderm forms the neural
cells and the epidermal cells. How do the ectoderm cells
determine which type of cells to form?
a.
Growth factors signal some of the ectodermal
cells to form epidermal cells, and the remaining
cells for
