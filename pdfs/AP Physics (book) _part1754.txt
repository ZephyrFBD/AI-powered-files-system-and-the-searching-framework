er and smaller,
approaching zero. That is, q is so tiny that it exerts essentially no force on the
other charges which created the field. From this definition (Eq. 16–3), we see that
the electric field at any point in space is a vector whose direction is the direction
of the force on a tiny positive test charge at that point, and whose magnitude is
the force per unit charge. Thus 
has SI units of newtons per coulomb 
The reason for defining 
as 
(with 
) is so that 
does not depend
on the magnitude of the test charge q. This means that 
describes only the effect
of the charges creating the electric field at that point.
