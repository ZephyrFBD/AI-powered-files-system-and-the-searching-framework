Question 5 
What was the intent of this question? 
Question 5 focuses on the impact of humans on the stability of populations, communities, and ecosystems. 
Students were asked to describe two potential biological risks to the ecosystem due to the large-scale 
cultivation and use of genetically modified crops by humans. Students were then asked to provide a 
proposed mitigation to reduce the effects of genetically modified crops on the ecosystem for each of the 
proposed risks. 
How well did students perform on this question? 
The mean score for this question was 1.78 out of a possible 4 points. 
What were common student errors or omissions?  
Overall, students demonstrated a poor understanding of genetically modified (GM) crops. Many students 
made the assumption that if any plant was ge
