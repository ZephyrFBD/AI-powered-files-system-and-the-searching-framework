e does. We say
that the
current lags the voltage by 90° for an inductor.
Because the current and voltage in an inductor are out of phase by 90°, the product
is as often positive as it is negative (Fig.21–40b). So no energy is trans-
formed in an inductor on average; and no energy is dissipated as thermal energy.

Just as a resistor impedes the flow of charge, so too an inductor imp
