us for his description of the cell membrane in 1972, which he called
the fluid mosaic model. The eukaryotic plasma membrane consists of a
phospholipid bilayer with proteins dispersed throughout the layers. A
phospholipid is amphipathic, meaning it has both a hydrophobic and

hydrophilic region (see Figures 2.10 and 3.8).
Nonpolar molecules, such as hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and
oxygen, are hydrophobic and can therefore dissolve in the lipid bilayer and
cross it readily without the need of membrane proteins. However, the
hydrophobic interior of the membrane impedes the flow of hydrophilic
substances, such as ions and polar molecules. Polar molecules, such as
glucose, do not pass through the inner phospholipid layer easily. Even
water, a very small polar molecule, does not pass through easily.
Integral proteins have nonpolar regions that completely span the
hydrophobic interior of the membrane. Peripheral proteins are loosely
bound to the s
