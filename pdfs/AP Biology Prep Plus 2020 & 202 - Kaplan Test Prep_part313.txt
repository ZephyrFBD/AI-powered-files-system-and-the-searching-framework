s to form complex tissues, secure cell-to-cell bonds must hold
them together. These cell junctions come in a variety of forms and serve
many diﬀerent purposes. Occluding junctions, otherwise known as tight
junctions, seal spaces between cells; anchoring junctions, which include
desmosomes, connect one cell’s cytoplasm to another through anchoring
proteins; and communicating junctions, including gap junctions and
plasmodesmata in plants, allow cells to directly exchange cytoplasmic
material via channels that cross both cells’ membranes. The contact form
of communication enabled by communicating junctions is to be
contrasted with the long-distance communication allowed by the
endocrine system.
Communicating Junctions
The best known of these cell-to-cell connections are the gap junctions,
formed by proteins called connexins, which build tubes or pores between
two adjacent cells’ cytoplasms. It is through these pores that ions and
other material can pass from one cell to the other. In cell
