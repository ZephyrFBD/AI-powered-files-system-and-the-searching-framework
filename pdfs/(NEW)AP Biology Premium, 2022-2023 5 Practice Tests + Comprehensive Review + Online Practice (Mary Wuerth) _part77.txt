Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (C) Oxygen atoms and hydrogen atoms are joined in covalent bonds within a water molecule. Because oxygen
has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen does, the electrons in this bond are unequally shared, and this
results in a polar covalent bond. Choice (A) is incorrect because hydrogen bonds occur between different water
molecules, not within a given water molecule. Choice (B) is incorrect because nonpolar covalent bonds form
between atoms with similar electronegativities. Choice (D) is incorrect because the electrons in the bonds within
a water molecule are shared; they are not transferred as is the case in an ionic bond.
2. (A) Hydrogen bonds occur between the hydrogen atom of one water molecule and the oxygen atom of another
water molecule. Choices (B) and (C) are incorrect because both describe int
