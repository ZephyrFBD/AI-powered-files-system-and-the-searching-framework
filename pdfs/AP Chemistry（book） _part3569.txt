roups in RNA and DNA, the molecules responsible for the control of protein 
biosynthesis and transmission of genetic information. It also occurs in adenosine tri-
phosphate (ATP), which stores energy in biological cells and has the following structure:

22.9 ∣ Carbon
Carbon constitutes only 0.027% of Earth’s crust. Although some carbon occurs in ele-
mental form as graphite and diamond, most is found in combined form. Over half occurs 
in carbonate compounds. Carbon is also found in coal, petroleum, and natural gas. The 
importance of the element stems in large part from its occurrence in all living organisms: 
Life as we know it is based on carbon compounds.
Elemental Forms of Carbon
We have seen that carbon exists in several allotropic crystalline forms: graphite, diamond, 
fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. Fullerenes, nanotubes, and graphene are 
discussed in Chapter 12; here we focus on graphite and diamond.
Graphite is a soft, black, slippery
