source of alternating voltage that produces an alternating current (ac).
First we examine, one at a time, how a resistor, a capacitor, and an inductor
behave when connected to a source of alternating voltage, represented by the symbol
[alternating voltage]
which produces a sinusoidal voltage of frequency f. We assume in each case that
the emf gives rise to a current
where 
is time and 
is the peak current. Remember (Section 18–7) that
and
(Eq. 18–8).
Resistor
When an ac source is connected to a resistor as in Fig.21–39a, the current increases
and decreases with the alternating voltage according to Ohm’s law,
where
is the peak voltage. Figure 21–39b shows the voltage (red curve)
and the current (blue curve) as a function of time. Because the current is zero
when the voltage is zero and the current reaches a peak when the voltage does,
we say that the current and voltage are in phase. Energy is transformed into heat
(Section 18–7), at an average rate
