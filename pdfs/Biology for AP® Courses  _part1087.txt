, but the response to second messengers is
different in each cell. How is this possible?
a.
Different cells produce the same receptor, which
bind to the same ligands, but have a different
response in each cell type.
b.
Cells produce variants of a particular receptor
for a particular ligand through alternative
splicing, resulting in different response in each
cell
c.
Cells contain different genes, which produce
different receptors that bind to same ligand,
activating different responses in each cell.
d.
Cells produce different receptors that bind to the
same ligand or the same receptor that binds to
the same ligand with different signaling
components, activating different responses in
each cell.
24. What would happen if the intracellular domain of a
cell-surface receptor was switched with the domain from
another receptor?
a.
It would activate the pathway normally triggered
by the receptor that contributed the intracellular
domain.
b.
It would activate the same pathway even after
the int
