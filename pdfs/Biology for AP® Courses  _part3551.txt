29. What types of issues related to bone development and
repair would you expect associated with someone
suffering from osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder
most commonly resulting from defects in collagen

a.
Bones are abnormally weak, brittle and highly

abnormal bone formation as manifested by
thicker and longer bones resulting in a taller

b.
Abnormally weak bones prone to breakage and

In severe cases, individuals may have abnormal
bone formation as manifested by thicker and
longer bones resulting in a taller stature.
c.
Bones are abnormally weak and highly flexible.
In severe cases, individuals may have abnormal
bone formation as manifested by thinner and/or

d.
Abnormally weak bones prone to breakage and
