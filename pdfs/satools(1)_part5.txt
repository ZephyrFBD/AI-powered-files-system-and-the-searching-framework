then finishing with a listing of an estimate of rho and the energy bin parameter values. 
 
The try_me function performs two tasks: 
 
1. Assigns values to the input variables of the SA Tools method anneal. 
 
2. Calls the anneal method. 
 
Since the anneal method has a large number of inputs, it is simpler to edit a “driver” function that 
assigns values to the inputs than to try and maintain them on the command line of an interactive session.  
Documentation on the input values is currently limited to comments built into the method.  To view them,
