l you hear if you are at
rest and the police car moves at 
(a) toward you, and (b) away from you?
APPROACH The observer is fixed, and the source moves, so we use Eqs. 12–2.
The frequency you (the observer) hear is the emitted frequency f divided by
the factor
where 
is the speed of the police car. Use the
minus sign when the car moves toward you (giving a higher frequency); use the
plus sign when the car moves away from you (lower frequency).
SOLUTION (a) The car is moving toward you, so (Eq. 12–2a)
(b) The car is moving away from you, so (Eq. 12–2b)

EXAMPLE 12;15
EXERCISE F Suppose the police car of Example 12–15 is at rest and emits at 1600 Hz.
What frequency would you hear if you were moving at 
(a) toward it, and
(b) away from it?
