FIGURE 22–4 Fields produced by
charge flowing into conductors. It
takes time for the 
and 
fields to
travel outward to distant points. The
fields are shown to the right of the
antenna, but they move out in all
directions, symmetrically about the
(vertical) antenna.

FIGURE 22–5 Sequence showing
electric and magnetic fields that
spread outward from oscillating
charges on two conductors (the
antenna) connected to an ac source
(see the text).
Now we look at the situation of Fig. 22–5, where our antenna is connected to
an ac generator. In Fig. 22–5a, the connection has just been comp
