engine, at a distance of 30 m, is 130 dB, and that the average
human ear has an effective radius of 2.0 cm. What would be
the power intercepted by an unprotected ear at a distance
of 30 m from a jet airplane engine?
77. In audio and communications systems, the gain,
in deci-
bels is defined for an amplifier as
where 
is the power input to the system and 
is the
power output. (a) A particular amplifier puts out 135 W 
of power for an input of 1.0 mW. What is its gain in dB?
(b) If a signal-to-noise ratio of 93 dB is specified, what is the
noise power if the output signal is 10 W?
78. Manufacturers typically offer a particular guitar string in a
choice of diameters so that players can tune their instruments
with a preferred string tension. For example, a nylon high-E
string is available in a low- and high-tension model with diam-
eter 0.699 mm and 0.724 mm, respectively. Assuming the
density of nylon is the same for each model, compare (as a
ratio) the tension in a tuned high- an
