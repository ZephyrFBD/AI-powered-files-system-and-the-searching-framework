ities. Thus, we must draw a Lewis 
structure for each molecule containing three or more atoms and 
determine its molecular geometry. We then use electronegativity 
values to determine the direction of the bond dipoles. Finally, we 
see whether the bond dipoles cancel to give a nonpolar molecule 
or reinforce each other to give a polar one.

(a) Chlorine is more electronegative than bromine. All diatomic 
molecules with polar bonds are polar molecules. Conse-
quently, BrCl is polar, with chlorine carrying the partial nega-
tive charge:
Br
Cl
 
The measured dipole moment m of BrCl is 0.57 D.
(b) Because oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur, SO2 has 
polar bonds. Three resonance forms can be written:
S
O

For each of these, the VSEPR model predicts a bent molecular 
geometry. Because the molecule is bent, the bond dipoles do 
not cancel, and the molecule is polar:
O
O
S
 
Experimentally, the dipole moment m of SO2 is 1.63 D.
