ny cells swim or move surrounding materials via the
beating motion of cellular appendages such as cilia and flagella.
All of the cellular processes listed above require a steady supply of energy. From where, and in what form, does this energy
come? How do living cells obtain energy and how do they use it? This chapter will discuss different forms of energy and
the physical laws that govern energy transfer.
How enzymes lower the activation energy required to begin a chemical reaction in the body will also be discussed in this
chapter. Enzymes are crucial for life; without them the chemical reactions required to survive would not happen fast enough
for an organism to survive. For example, in an individual who lacks one of the enzymes needed to break down a type of
carbohydrate known as a mucopolysaccharide, waste products accumulate in the cells and cause progressive brain damage.
This deadly genetic disease is called Sanfilippo Syndrome type B or Mucopolysaccharidosis III. Previously in
