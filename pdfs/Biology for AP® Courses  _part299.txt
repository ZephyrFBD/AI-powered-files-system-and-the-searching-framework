Phospholipids
Phospholipids are major constituents of the plasma membrane, the outermost layer of all living cells. Like fats, they are
composed of fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol or sphingosine backbone. Instead of three fatty acids attached as in
triglycerides, however, there are two fatty acids forming diacylglycerol, and the third carbon of the glycerol backbone is
occupied by a modified phosphate group (Figure 3.20). A phosphate group alone attached to a diaglycerol does not qualify
as a phospholipid; it is phosphatidate (diacylglycerol 3-phosphate), the precursor of phospholipids. The phosphate group
is modified by an alcohol. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine are two important phospholipids that are found in
plasma membranes.

backbone. The phosphate may be modified by the addition of charged or polar chemical group
