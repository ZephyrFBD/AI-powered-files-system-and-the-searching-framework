ny measurements during the 
fourth hour, we cannot tell, and we confess our ignorance quite openly by means of the 
broken line. The broken line portion of the graph is called an extrapolation, because it 
goes beyond our actual experience with this particular reaction. Between any two of our

measured points it seems fairly safe to assume that the reaction is proceeding steadily, 
and this is called an interpolation. Interpolations can only be made between measured 
points on a graph; beyond the measured points we must extrapolate. We know that the 
amount of A remaining after 4 hours is somewhere between 0 and 40 mg. The amount 
indicated by the broken line on the graph, 20 mg, is only a logical guess. 
Unfortunately, it sometimes happens that even professionals take this sort of 
limitation of line graphs for granted and do not confess, by means of a broken line, the 
places where they are just guessing. Therefore, it is up to readers of the graph to
