rs by hiding under
water for many minutes while breathing through a long,
thin reed. Assuming the maximum pressure difference his
lungs can manage and still breathe is

the deepest he could have been.
14. (II) The maximum gauge pressure in a hydraulic lift is
17.0 atm. What is the largest-size vehicle (kg) it can lift if
the diameter of the output line is 25.5 cm?
15. (II) The gauge pressure in each of the four tires of an auto-
mobile is 240 kPa. If each tire has a “footprint” of 
(area touching the ground), estimate the mass of the car.
16. (II) (a) Determine the total force and the absolute pressure
on the bottom of a swimming pool 28.0 m by 8.5 m whose
uniform depth is 1.8 m. (b) What will be the pressure
against the side of the pool near the bottom?
17. (II) A house at the bottom of a hill is fed by a full tank of
water 6.0 m deep and connected to the house by a pipe
that is 75 m long at an angle of 61° from the horizontal
(Fig. 10–49). (a) Determine the water gauge pres
