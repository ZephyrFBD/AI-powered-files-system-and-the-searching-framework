 of grams of a reactant, first convert grams of reactant to 
moles of reactant. Then use the coefficients in the balanced equation 
to convert the number of moles of reactant to moles of product. Fi-
nally, convert moles of product to grams of product.
A limiting reactant is completely consumed in a reaction. When 
it is used up, the reaction stops, thus limiting the quantities of prod-
ucts formed. The theoretical yield of a reaction is the quantity of prod-
uct calculated to form when all of the limiting reactant reacts. The 
actual yield of a reaction is always less than the theoretical yield. The 
percent yield compares the actual and theoretical yields.
