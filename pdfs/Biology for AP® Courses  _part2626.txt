f elongation, and a zone of maturation and differentiation
(Figure 23.16). The zone of cell division is closest to the root tip; it is made up of the actively dividing cells of the
root meristem. The zone of elongation is where the newly formed cells increase in length, thereby lengthening the root.
Beginning at the first root hair is the zone of cell maturation where the root cells begin to differentiate into special cell types.
All three zones are in the first centimeter or so of the root tip.
Figure 23.16 A longitudinal view of the root reveals the zones of cell division, elongation, and maturation. Cell division
occurs in the apical meristem.

The root has an outer layer of cells called the epidermis, which surrounds areas of ground tissue and vascular tissue. The
epidermis provides protection and helps in absorption. Root hairs, which are extensions of root epi
