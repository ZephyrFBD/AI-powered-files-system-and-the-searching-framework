TWO features of natural selection that lead to the spread of antibiotic resistance in a 
population over many generations. Give ONE reason that the development of antibiotic 
resistance is an example of evolution.  
Description (1 point per row, 2 points max) 
Selective Advantage
Variants with antibiotic resistance have higher survival rates
Variants without antibiotic resistance have lower survival rates 
Reproductive Fitness 
Resistant individuals produce more offspring
Reasoning (1 point) 
Phenotypes/characteristics/traits in the population are changing over multiple generations  
Change in allele frequency in the population  
(e) Giving low doses of antibiotics to beef cattle to control the population sizes of intestinal bacteria 
can result in more efficient uptake of food materials by the cattle. Pose an ethical question that the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should consider when deciding whether to approve this type 
of antibiotic use in beef cattle.
