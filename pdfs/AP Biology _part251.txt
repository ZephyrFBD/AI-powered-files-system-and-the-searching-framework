-dependent reactions. Choice A is not correct because PGAL or
G3P is produced in the stroma from the Calvin cycle. Choice B is
not correct because carbon dioxide is not released during
photosynthesis; rather, carbon dioxide is a raw material for the
Calvin cycle. Choice D is not correct because photorespiration does
not 
produce 
ATP, 
nor 
does 
it 
produce 
sugar. 
Rather,
photorespiration occurs when rubisco binds with oxygen instead of
CO2. (ENE-1)
(C) Three turns of the Calvin cycle produce the 3-carbon PGAL
(G3P), while six turns of the Calvin cycle produce glucose. Choice
A is incorrect because the Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma. Choice
B is incorrect because the Calvin cycle (which is part of the light-
independent reactions) occurs when there is light because this
process depends on the products of the light-dependent reactions,
which only occur when there is light. Choice D is incorrect because
the Calvin cycle results in the reduction of CO2, not the oxidation of
glucose.
