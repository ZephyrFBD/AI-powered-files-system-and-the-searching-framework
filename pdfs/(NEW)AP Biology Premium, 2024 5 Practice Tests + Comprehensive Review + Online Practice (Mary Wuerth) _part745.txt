e tissue would have nuclei and mitochondria but not chloroplasts or cell walls. Choice (A) is
incorrect because human cells do not contain chloroplasts. Choice (C) is incorrect because human cells have
nuclei, and choice (D) is incorrect because human cells do not have cell walls.
40. (B) Hydrolysis uses water to break down polymers into monomers, and dehydration synthesis combines
monomers into polymers while removing a water molecule. Choice (A) is incorrect because hydrolysis does not
build monomers nor does dehydration synthesis break down monomers. Hydrolysis reactions consume, not
release, water, so choice (C) is incorrect. All macromolecules, not just carbohydrates and proteins, can be
broken down by hydrolysis reactions, so choice (D) is incorrect.
41. (D) Water has a high specific heat because hydrogen bonds form between the oxygen atom on one water
molecule and the hydrogen atom on another water molecule. Choices (A) and (C) are incorrect because the high
specific heat of wat
