*Frequently, metal compounds obtained from aqueous solution have water associated with 
them. For example, copper(II) sulfate crystallizes from water with 5 mol of water per mole of 
CuSO4. We represent this substance by the formula CuSO4 # 5H2O. Such compounds are called 
hydrates. 
 (Section 13.1) Rust is a hydrate of iron(III) oxide with a variable amount of water of 
hydration. We represent this variable water content by writing the formula Fe2O3 # xH2O.

oxygen and water, corrosion begins as the iron is oxidized.
