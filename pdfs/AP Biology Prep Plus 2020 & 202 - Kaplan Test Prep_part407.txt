tion of a large number of NADH and FADH2, which ultimately
contribute to the production of a large number of ATP molecules.
AP EXPERT NOTE
The exam will not test you on the details of pyruvate
decarboxylation or the steps and intermediates of the citric acid
cycle, so just be aware of the role each process plays in the larger
process of aerobic respiration.
The net reaction of the citric acid cycle per glucose molecule is:
2 Acetyl-CoA + 6 NAD+ + 2 FAD + 2 GDP + 2 Pi + 4 H2O â†’ 4 CO2 + 6 NADH + 2
FADH2 + 2 ATP + 4 H+ + 2 CoA
ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN
The electron transport chain (ETC) is a complex carrier mechanism
located on the inside of the inner mitochondrial membrane. During
oxidative phosphorylation, ATP is produced when high-energy-potential
electrons are transferred from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen by a series of
carrier molecules located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. As the
electrons are transferred from carrier to carrier, free energy is released,
which is then used to form
