oles of solute particles are formed for each 
mole of dissolved salt. The boiling point or freezing point is thus ele-
vated or depressed, respectively, approximately twice as much as that 
of a nonelectrolyte solution of the same concentration. Similar con-
siderations apply to other strong electrolytes.
Osmosis is the movement of solvent molecules through a semi-
permeable membrane from a less concentrated to a more concen-
trated solution. This net movement of solvent generates an osmotic 
pressure, Π, which can be measured in units of gas pressure, such as 
atm. The osmotic pressure of a solution is proportional to the solu-
tion molarity: Π = iMRT. Osmosis is a very important process in 
living systems, in which cell walls act as semipermeable membranes, 
permitting the passage of water but restricting the passage of ionic 
and macromolecular components.
