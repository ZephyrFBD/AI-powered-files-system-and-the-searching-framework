pair, called
homologous chromosomes. In a homologous pair of chromosomes, one homologue originated from the maternal
parent, the other from the paternal parent. Humans have 46 chromosomes, 23 homologous pairs, consisting of a total
of 92 chromatids. sister chromatids.

The cell cycle describes the sequence of events that occurs during the life of most eukaryotic cells (Figure 7-2).
During interphase, the period during which the cell is not dividing, the chromatin is enclosed within a clearly
defined nuclear envelope. Within the nucleus, one or more nucleoli are visible. Outside the nucleus, two
microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) lie adjacent to one another. In animals, the MTOCs are the
centrosomes, and each contains a pair of centrioles. When cell division begins, these features change, as described
in the “Mitosis and Cytokinesis” section that follows.

Mitosis and Cytokinesis
Mitosis is the division of the nucleus to form two nuclei, and cytokinesis is the di
