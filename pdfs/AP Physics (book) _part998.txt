w much mass could the person hold
with a muscle exertion of 450 N?
32. (I) Approximately what magnitude force,
must the
extensor muscle in the upper arm exert on the lower arm
to hold a 7.3-kg shot put (Fig. 9–71)? Assume the lower
arm has a mass of 2.3 kg and its CG is 12.0 cm from the
elbow-joint pivot.

36. (II) The Achilles tendon is attached to the rear of the foot
as shown in Fig. 9–73. When a person elevates himself just
barely off the floor on the “ball of one foot,” estimate the
tension 
in the Achilles tendon (pulling upward), and
the (downward) force 
exerted by the lower leg bone on
the foot. Assume the person has a mass of 72 kg and D is
twice as long as d.
