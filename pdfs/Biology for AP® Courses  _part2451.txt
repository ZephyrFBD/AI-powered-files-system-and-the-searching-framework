acellular matrix composed primarily of polysaccharides
holds the biofilm together. During stage 4, maturation II, the biofilm continues to grow and takes on a more
complex shape. During stage 5, dispersal, the biofilm matrix is partly broken down, allowing some bacteria to
escape and colonize another surface. Micrographs of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm in each of the stages of
development are shown. (credit: D. Davis, Don Monroe, PLoS)
22.2 | Structure of Prokaryotes
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are similarities in the structures of the prokaryotes, Archaea and Bacteria?
•
What are examples of structural differences between Archaea and Bacteria?
Connection for AP® Courses
Domains Archaea and Bacteria contain single-celled organisms lacking a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
The two groups have substantial biochemical and structural differences. Most have a cell wall external to the plasma cell
membrane, the composition of which can v
