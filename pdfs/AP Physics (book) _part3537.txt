dine goes to
the human thyroid. (It can be used for diagnosis and
treatment of thyroid problems.) In a normal thyroid,
absorption can cause damage to the thyroid. (a) Write
down the reaction for the decay of 
(b) Its half-life is
8.0 d; how long would it take for ingested 
to become
5.0% of the initial value? (c) Absorbing 1 mCi of 
can
be harmful; what mass of iodine is this?
51. (III) Assume a liter of milk typically has an activity of
2000 pCi due to 
If a person drinks two glasses (0.5 L)
per day, estimate the total effective dose (in Sv and in rem)
received in a year. As a crude model, assume the milk
stays in the stomach 12 hr and is then released. Assume
also that roughly 10% of the 1.5 MeV released per decay is
absorbed by the body. Compare your result to the normal
allowed dose of 100 mrem per year. Make your estimate
for (a) a 60-kg adult, and (b) a 6-kg baby.
