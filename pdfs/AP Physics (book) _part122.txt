I) What are the dimensions of density, which is mass per
volume?
*37. (II) The speed 
of an object is given by the equation
where 
refers to time. (a) What are the
dimensions of A and B? (b) What are the SI units for the
constants A and B?
*38. (II) Three students derive the following equations in
which x refers to distance traveled,
the speed, a the
acceleration 
the time, and the subscript zero 
means a quantity at time 
.
Here are their 
equations: (a) 
(b) 
and
(c)
Which of these could possibly be
correct according to a dimensional check, and why?
*39. (III) The smallest meaningful measure of length is called the
Planck length, and is defined in terms of three fundamental
constants in nature: the speed of light 
the gravitational constant 
and
Planckâ€™s constant 
The Planck
length 
is given by the following combination of these
three constants:
Show that the dimensions of 
are length [L], and find the
order of magnitude of 
[Recent theories (Chapters 32
and 33) suggest that the smal
