iction
Until now we have ignored friction, but it must be taken into account in most
practical situations. Friction exists between two solid surfaces because even the
smoothest looking surface is quite rough on a microscopic scale, Fig. 4–26. When
we try to slide an object across a surface, these microscopic bumps impede the
motion. Exactly what is happening at the microscopic level is not yet fully under-
stood. It is thought that the atoms on a bump of one surface may come so close to
the atoms of the other surface that attractive electric forces between the atoms
could “bond” as a tiny weld between the two surfaces. Sliding an object across a
surface is often jerky, perhaps due to the making and breaking of these bonds.
Even when a round object rolls across a surface, there is still some friction, called
rolling friction, although it is generally much less than when an object slides across
a surface. We focus now on sliding friction, which is usually called kinetic friction
