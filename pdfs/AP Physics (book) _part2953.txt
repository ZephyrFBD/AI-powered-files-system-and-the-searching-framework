f Velocities
Consider a rocket ship that travels away from the Earth with speed v, and assume
that this rocket has fired off a second rocket that travels at speed 
with 
respect to the first (Fig. 26–11). We might expect that the speed u of rocket 2 
with respect to Earth is 
which in the case shown in Fig. 26–11 is
But, as discussed in Section 26–8, no object can travel
faster than the speed of light in any reference frame. Indeed, Einstein showed
that since length and time are different in different reference frames, the classical
addition-of-velocities formula is no longer valid. Instead, the correct formula is
(26–10)
for motion along a straight line. We derive this formula in Appendix E. If 
is in
the opposite direction from v, then 
must have a minus sign in the above equation
so
Relative velocity, relativistically. Calculate the speed of
rocket 2 in Fig. 26–11 with respect to Earth.
APPROACH We combine the speed of rocket 2 relative to rocket 1 with the
speed of rocket 1 relativ
