his mass of water would have a volume of 560,000 L,  
or roughly 150,000 gallons.  Thus, we see that large amounts 
of potential energy can be stored as chemical energy.

A 12-oz vanilla milkshake at a fast-food restaurant contains  
547 Calories. What quantity of energy is this in joules?
Solar Energy Steps Up. Given the chal-
lenges society faces in trying to mitigate the ef-
fects of climate change, the need for affordable 
clean energy has never been greater. Given 
the massive amount of energy our planet re-
ceives from the Sun, solar energy has long 
been touted as a technology of the future. The 
problem for decades has been the relatively 
high cost of solar power compared to
