 24.45  Draw the molecular structure for (a) an aldehyde that is an iso-
mer of acetone, (b) an ether that is an isomer of 1-propanol.
 24.46  (a) Give the empirical formula and structural formula for 
a cyclic ether containing four carbon atoms in the ring. 
(b) Write the structural formula for a straight-chain com-
pound that is a structural isomer of your answer to part (a).
 24.47  The IUPAC name for a carboxylic acid is based on the 
name of the hydrocarbon with the same number of carbon 
atoms. The ending -oic is appended, as in ethanoic acid, 
which is the IUPAC name for acetic acid. Draw the struc-
ture of the following acids: (a) methanoic acid, (b) penta-
noic acid, (c) 2-chlor
