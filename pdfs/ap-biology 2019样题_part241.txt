 time from instrument 
suppliers. Chemical companies often have equipment 
that can be borrowed; company representatives should 
have this information. Alternatively, local colleges or 
universities may allow high school students to complete 
a lab as a field trip on their campus, or they may allow 
teachers to borrow their equipment. They may even 
donate their old equipment to your school. Some 
schools have partnerships with local businesses that 
can help with lab equipment and materials. It never hurts 
to ask for equipment and/or make your laboratory needs 
known. There are many grant programs that biology 
teachers can apply to for funds to purchase equipment 
and supplies, and you can also use online donation sites 
such as Donors Choose and Adopt-A-Classroom.
AP Biology is a college-level course, but the equipment 
and chemicals needed for the labs are comparable to 
those required for a high school-level biology course.
