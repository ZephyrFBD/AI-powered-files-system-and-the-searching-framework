3–7 Projectile Motion Is Parabolic
We now show that the path followed by any projectile is a parabola, if we can
ignore air resistance and can assume that 
is constant. To do so, we need to find
y as a function of x by eliminating between the two equations for horizontal and
vertical motion (Eq. 2–11b in Table 3–2), and for simplicity we set
From the first equation, we have
and we substitute this into the second
one to obtain
(3;6)
We see that y as a function of x has the form
where A and B are constants for any specific projectile motion. This is the standard
