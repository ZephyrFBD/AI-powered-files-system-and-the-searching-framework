 a releaser pheromone to mark trails that guide other ants to food.
Queen bees, queen termites, and queen ants secrete primer pheromones that are eaten by workers. The pheromones
prevent development of reproductive ability.
Many male mammals exhibit territoriality when they spray urine throughout their territories (especially along their
borders) to warn other animals of the same species to keep out.
2. Visual. Many visual displays are observed in animals during acts of aggression (agonistic behavior) or during
courtship preceding reproduction.
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, ethologist Nikolaas
Tinbergen found that various visual displays are releasers for reproductive behavior in stickleback fish. The red
belly of the male fish attracts females, who adopt a head-up posture to initiate courtship. In response, males make
zigzag motions. The female then follows the male to his nest and, if the nest is acceptable, enters it and deposits her
