them to adhere more
tightly to rocks in the soil. To learn more about this mutation,
scientists perform a cross between a long-rooted plant and an
original short-rooted plant. When planted, the 38 seeds produced
from the cross grew into 24 short-rooted plants and 14 long-
rooted plants. Calculate the chi-squared value for the hypothesis
that the short-rooted parent was heterozygous for the short-root
gene, assuming the short-root allele is dominant. Give your
answer to the nearest tenth.
