on a cell
capacitor’s negative plate? (b) After charge has been placed
on a cell capacitor’s plate, it slowly “leaks” off at a rate of
about 
How long does it take for the potential
difference across this capacitor to decrease by 2.0% from
its fully charged value? (Because of this leakage effect, the
charge on a DRAM capacitor is “refreshed” many times
per second.) Note: A DRAM cell is shown in Fig. 21–29.

incandescent lightbulbs is caused by
the electric current passing through it.
