exerts an upward force
on the bag equal to its weight. But this upward 
force is perpendicular to the horizontal displacement of the bag and thus is doing 
no work. This conclusion comes from our definition of work, Eq. 6–1:
because
and
Thus, when a particular force is perpendicu-
lar to the displacement, no work is done by that force. When you start or stop
walking, there is a horizontal acceleration and you do briefly exert a horizontal
force, and thus do work on the bag.

When we deal with work, as with force, it is necessary to specify whether you
