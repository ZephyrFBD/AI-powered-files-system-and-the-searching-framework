 diet;
grains, fruits, and vegetables are all natural sources of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates provide energy to the body, particularly
through glucose, a simple sugar that is a component of starch and an ingredient in many staple foods. Carbohydrates also
have other important functions in humans, animals, and plants.
Carbohydrates can be represented by the stoichiometric formula (CH2O)n, where n is the number of carbons in the
molecule. In other words, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules. This formula also
explains the origin of the term “carbohydrate”: the components are carbon (“carbo”) and the components of water (hence,
“hydrate”). Carbohydrates are classified into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.
Monosaccharides
Monosaccharides (mono- = “one”; sacchar- = “sweet”) are simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose. In
monosaccharides, the number of carbons usually ranges from three to seven. Most monos
