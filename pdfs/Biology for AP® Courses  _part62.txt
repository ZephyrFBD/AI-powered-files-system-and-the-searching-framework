The content presented in this section supports the Learning Objectives outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP® Biology
Curriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives merge Essential Knowledge content with one or more of the seven
Science Practices. These objectives provide a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, along with inquiry-based
laboratory experiences, instructional activities, and AP® Exam questions.
