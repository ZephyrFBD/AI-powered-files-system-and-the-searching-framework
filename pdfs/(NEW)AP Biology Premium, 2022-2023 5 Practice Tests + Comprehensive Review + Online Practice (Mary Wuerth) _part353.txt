13. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) uses a heat-stable DNA polymerase and repeated cycles of DNA replication
to amplify specific sequences of DNA. Primers specific to the desired DNA sequences are used to direct DNA
polymerase to the beginning of the sequence to be amplified. The following table shows the number of copies
of the DNA sequence that exist at the end of each cycle.

(a) Explain why a primer is needed to direct DNA polymerase to copy the desired sequence.
(b) Construct a graph of the data from the table.
(c) Analyze the data, and state the mathematical relationship between the number of cycles of PCR and the
number of copies of the desired DNA sequence generated.
(d) Predict the minimum number of cycles required to generate 1,000 copies of the desired DNA sequence.
