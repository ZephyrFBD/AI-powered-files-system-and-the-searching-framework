In the soap bubble of our Chapter-Opening Photo (page 679), similar things
happen: at the top (where the film is thinnest) we see black and then silver-white,
just as in the soap film shown in Fig. 24–29b.
Also examine the oil film on wet pavement shown in Fig. 24–29c (repeated
here). The oil film is thickest at the center and thins out toward the edges. Notice
the whitish outer ring where most colors constructively interfere, which would
suggest a thickness on the order of 100 nm as discussed above for the white band
in the soap film. Beyond the outer white band of the oil film, Fig. 24–29c, there is
still some oil, but the film is so thin that reflected light from upper and lower sur-
faces destructively interfere and you can see right through this very thin oil film.
Lens Coatings
An important application of thin-film interference is in the coating of glass to
make it “nonreflecting,” particularly for lenses. A glass surface reflects about 4%
of the light inci
