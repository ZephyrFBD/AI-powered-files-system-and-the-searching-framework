the future bone. They then differentiate into osteoblasts at the ossification center. Osteoblasts secrete the extracellular
matrix and deposit calcium, which hardens the matrix. The non-mineralized portion of the bone or osteoid continues to form
around blood vessels, forming spongy bone. Connective tissue in the matrix differentiates into red bone marrow in the fetus.
The spongy bone is remodeled into a thin layer of compact bone on the surface of the spongy bone.
Endochondral Ossification
Endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage. All of the bones of the body, except
for the flat bones of the skull, mandible, and clavicles, are formed through endochondral ossification.
In long bones, chondrocytes form a template of the hyaline cartilage diaphysis. Responding to complex developmental
signals, the matrix begins to calcify. This calcification prevents diffusion of nutrients into the matrix, resulting in
chondrocytes dying and the opening up of c
