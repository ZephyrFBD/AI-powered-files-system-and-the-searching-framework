>mol2 and the observed 
heat of hydrogenation 1-208 kJ>mol2 is due to stabilization of the p electrons through 
delocalization in the p orbitals that extend around the ring. Chemists call this stabiliza-
tion energy the resonance energy.
substitution Reactions of Aromatic Hydrocarbons
Although aromatic hydrocarbons are unsaturated, they do not readily undergo addi-
tion reactions. The delocalized p bonding causes aromatic compounds to behave 
quite differently from alkenes and alkynes. Benzene, for example, does not add Cl2 
or Br2 to its double bonds under ordinary conditions. In contrast, aromatic hydro-
carbons undergo substitution reactions relatively easily. In a substitution reac-
tion, one hydrogen atom of the molecule is removed and replaced (substituted) by 
another atom or group of atoms. When benzene is warmed in a mixture of nitric and 
sulfuric acids, for example, one of the benzene hydrogens is replaced by the nitro 
 
group, NO2:

 H2O
NO2
H2SO4
