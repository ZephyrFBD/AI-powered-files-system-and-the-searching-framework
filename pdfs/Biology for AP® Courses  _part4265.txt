This loss of ice is leading to increases in the global sea level. On average, the sea is rising at a rate of 1.8 mm per year.

However, between 1993 and 2010 the rate of sea level increase ranged between 2.9 and 3.4 mm per year. A variety of
factors affect the volume of water in the ocean, including the temperature of the water (the density of water is related to its
temperature) and the amount of water found in rivers, lakes, glaciers, polar ice caps, and sea ice. As glaciers and polar ice
caps melt, there is a significant contribution of liquid water that was previously frozen.
In addition to some abiotic conditions changing in response to climate change, many organisms are also being affected by
the changes in temperature. Temperature and precipitation play key roles in determining the geographic distribution and
phenology of plants and animals. (Phenology is the study of the effects of climatic conditions on the timing of p
