ding a different 
mechanism for the reaction. In the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, for example, 
two successive reactions of H2O2, first with bromide and then with bromine, take place. 
Because these two reactions together serve as a catalytic pathway for hydrogen peroxide 
decomposition, both of them must have significantly lower activation energies than the 
uncatalyzed decomposition (Figure 14.22).
Heterogeneous Catalysis
A heterogeneous catalyst is one that exists in a phase different from the phase of the 
reactant molecules, usually as a solid in contact with either gaseous reactants or reactants 
in a liquid solution. Many industrially important reactions are catalyzed by the surfaces 
of solids. For example, raw petroleum is transformed into smaller hydrocarbon molecules 
by using what are called “cracking” catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts are often com-
posed of metals or metal oxides.
The initial step in heterogeneous catalysis is usually adsorption of reactants.
