Question 6
Essential Knowledge
3.A.1: DNA, and in some cases RNA, is the primary 
source of heritable information.
Science Practice
1.2: The student can describe representations and models 
of natural or man-made phenomena and systems in the 
domain.
Learning Objective 
3.3: The student is able to describe representations and 
models that illustrate how genetic information is copied 
for transmission between generations.
(A)
This option is incorrect. The figure shows both template strands of DNA being 
replicated continuously in a parallel direction. No “lagging” strand with Okazaki 
fragments is identified. DNA polymerase’s structure does not allow it to add 
nuc
