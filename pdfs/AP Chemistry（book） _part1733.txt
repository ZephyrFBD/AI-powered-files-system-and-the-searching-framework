s of the remaining substances 
depend on molecular weight, polarity, and hydrogen bonding. 
The molecular weights are H2, 2 amu; CO, 28 amu; HF, 20 amu; 
and Ne, 20 amu. The boiling point of H2 should be the lowest 
because it is nonpolar and has the lowest molecular weight. The 
molecular weights of CO, HF, and Ne are similar. Because HF can 
hydrogen-bond, it should have the highest boiling point of the 
three. Next is CO, which is slightly polar and has the highest 
molecular weight. Finally, Ne, which is nonpolar, should have 
the lowest boiling point of these three. The predicted order of 
boiling points is, therefore,
H2 6 Ne 6 CO 6 HF 6 BaCl2
List the substances BaCl2, H2, CO, HF, and Ne in order of increasing boiling point.
Sample Exercise 11.2 
Predicting Types and Relative Strengths of Intermolecular Attractions
Check The boiling points reported in the literature are 
H2, 20 K; Ne, 27 K; CO, 83 K; HF, 293 K; and BaCl2, 1813 K—in 
agreement with our predictions.
