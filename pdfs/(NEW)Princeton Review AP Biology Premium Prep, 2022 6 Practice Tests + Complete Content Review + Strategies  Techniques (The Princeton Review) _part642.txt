uld occur if the mammalian genome is altered, such as if the viral genome inserted
itself and disrupted mammalian gene expression. A pilus forms between two bacteria, so (A) is wrong.
Also eliminate (C) because the host’s genome is not converted to the viral genome. Choice (D) is
incorrect because spores are released by fungi, not viruses.

C
Crossing-over and synapsis occur during meiosis, which produces haploid gametes. Separation of
homologous chromosomes occurs during meiosis I, while separation of sister chromatids does not occur
until meiosis II.

D
If potential mates have different alleles, this doesn’t keep them from mating. Having different alleles of a
gene is just a normal part of genetic variation. Use common sense to eliminate the other answer choices.
If the organisms don’t meet, they won’t reproduce; eliminate (A). Also eliminate (B) and (C): if potential
mates do not share the same behaviors (such as courtship rituals), they may not mate.

There is no union o
