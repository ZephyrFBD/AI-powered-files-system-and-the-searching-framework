etailed in Figure 26.28. Some
cranial nerves transmit only sensory information. For example, the olfactory nerve transmits information about smells from
the nose to the brainstem. Other cranial nerves transmit almost solely motor information. For example, the oculomotor nerve
controls the opening and closing of the eyelid and some eye movements. Other cranial nerves contain a mix of sensory and
motor fibers. For example, the glossopharyngeal nerve has a role in both taste (sensory) and swallowing (motor).

Figure 26.28 The human brain contains 12 cranial nerves that receive sensory input and control motor output for the
head and neck.
Spinal nerves transmit sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and the rest of the body. Each of the 31
spinal nerves (in humans) contains both sensory and motor axons. The sensory neuron cell bodies are grouped in structures
