ses exponentially. PCR can amplify DNA to billions of copies in hours.
Gel Electrophoresis and DNA Fingerprinting
Gel electrophoresis is a procedure that separates restriction fragments. In this procedure, DNA fragments of
different lengths are separated as they diffuse through a gelatinous material under the influence of an electric field.
Since DNA is negatively charged (because of the phosphate groups), it moves toward the positive electrode. Shorter
fragments migrate further through the gel than longer, heavier fragments. Gel electrophoresis is often used to
compare DNA fragments of closely related species in an effort to determine evolutionary relationships.
When restriction fragments between individuals of the same species are compared, the fragments differ in length
because of polymorphisms, which are slight differences in DNA sequences. These fragments are called restriction
fragment length polymorphisms, or RFLPs. In DNA fingerprinting, RFLPs produced from DNA left at a crime
