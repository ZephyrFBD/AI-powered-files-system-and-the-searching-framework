The tundra is commonly referred to as the frozen desert because it
gets very little rainfall and what rainfall that does occur cannot
penetrate the frozen ground.
The tundra has the appearance of gently rolling plains with many
lakes, ponds, and bogs in depressions.
Insects, particularly flies, are abundant. As a result, vast numbers of
birds nest in the tundra in the summer and migrate south in the
winter.
Principal mammals include reindeer, caribou, Arctic wolves, Arctic
foxes, Arctic hares, lemmings, and polar bears.
Though the number of individual organisms in the tundra is large,
the number of species is small.
The high Arctic tundra—a subset of permafrost—remains a strong
carbon sink.

The activities of organisms are affected by interactions with biotic and abiotic factors.
Aquatic Biomes
Aquatic biomes cover about 75% of Earth. Unlike terrestrial biomes, they
are not characterized by a single dominant group of organisms. The
