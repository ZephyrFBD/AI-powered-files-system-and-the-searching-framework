lection eliminates individuals that have extreme or unusual traits. Under this condition, individuals
with the most common form of a trait are the best adapted, while individuals who differ from the common form are
poorly adapted. As a result, stabilizing selection maintains the existing population frequencies of common traits
while selecting against all other trait variations.
2. Directional selection favors traits that are at one extreme of a range of traits. Traits at the opposite extreme are
selected against. If directional selection continues for many generations, favored traits become more and more
extreme, leading to distinct changes in the allele frequencies of the population.
The Darwin finches described at the beginning of this chapter were an example of directional selection. Beak size
increased because only large seeds with hard seed coats were available due to a drought. However, when rains
returned, directional selection reversed direction toward smaller beaks as smaller
