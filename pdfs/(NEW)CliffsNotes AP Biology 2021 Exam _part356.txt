 for transcription can be increased by the following:
Acetylation. Histone molecules loosen their grip on the DNA molecule when they are acetylatedâ€”that is, when an
acetyl group
 
(-COCH3) is attached. Acetylated histones are associated with
 
activated transcription.
 Methylation. Histones are methylated when a methyl group (
 
CH3) is attached. In most cases, methylated histones are
 
associated with repressed transcription.
3. X inactivation is a special case of chromosome inactivation in female mammals. A few days after fertilization,
one of the two X sex chromosomes in each cell of female embryos is randomly inactivated. A gene on the
chromosome that is silenced produces a noncoding RNA transcript that is associated with a loss of acetylation in the
histone proteins of nucleosomes. The descendants of each cell maintain the same inactivated X chromosome. The
purpose of X inactivation is to equalize the gene dosage that both males (who have only one X chromosome) and
females express
