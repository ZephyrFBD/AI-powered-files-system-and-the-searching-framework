Quark combinations. Find the baryon
number, charge, and strangeness for the following quark combinations, and iden-
tify the hadron particle that is made up of these quark combinations: (a) udd,
(b) 
(c) uss, (d) sdd, and (e)
RESPONSE We use Table 32–3 to get the properties of the quarks, then
Table 32–2 or 32–4 to find the particle that has these properties.
(a) udd has
