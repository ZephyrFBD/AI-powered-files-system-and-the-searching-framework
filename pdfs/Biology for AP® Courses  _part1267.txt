n differences between the two processes?
a.
Meiosis differs from mitosis in that the number
of chromosomes is halved and genetic variation
is introduced in meiosis, but not in mitosis.
b.
Meiosis differs from mitosis in that the number
of chromosomes is halved and genetic variation
is reduced in meiosis, but not in mitosis.
c.
Metaphase and telophase portions of meiosis and
mitosis are the same. Meiosis and mitosis are
also the same, except for the number of
chromosomes. Anaphase I and anaphase are
different.
d.
Prophase and telophase portions of meiosis and
mitosis are the same. Meiosis II and mitosis are
also the same and have the same number of
chromosomes. Anaphase I and anaphase are
different.
18. Explain how the orientation of homologous
chromosomes during metaphase I of meiosis contributes to
greater variation in gametes.
a.
The random alignment of homologous
chromosomes at the metaphase plate ensures the
random destination of the chromosomes in the
daughter cells.
b.
Because ho
