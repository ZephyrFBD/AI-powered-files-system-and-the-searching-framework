nts differ for genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I, II, and III. RNA
polymerase I transcribes genes that have two GC-rich promoter sequences in the -45 to +20 region. These sequences alone
are sufficient for transcription initiation to occur, but promoters with additional sequences in the region from -180 to -105
upstream of the initiation site will further enhance initiation. Genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III have
upstream promoters or promoters that occur within the genes themselves.
Eukaryotic Elongation and Termination
Following the formation of the preinitiation complex, the polymerase is released from the other transcription factors, and
elongation is allowed to proceed as it does in prokaryotes with the polymerase synthesizing pre-mRNA in the 5' to 3'
direction. As discussed previously, RNA polymerase II transcribes the major share of eukaryotic genes, so this section will
focus on how this polymerase accomplishes elongation and termination.
