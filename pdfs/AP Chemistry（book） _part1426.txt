Do you expect diazine to be a linear molecule (all four atoms on the same line)?  
If not, do you expect the molecule to be planar (all four atoms in the same plane)?

Describe how the bonds in formaldehyde are formed in terms of overlaps of hybrid and unhybridized orbitals.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to describe the bonding in formaldehyde in 
terms of hybrid orbitals.
Plan Single bonds are s bonds, and double bonds consist of one s 
bond and one p bond. The ways in which these bonds form can be 
deduced from the molecular geometry, which we predict using the 
VSEPR model.
Solve The C atom has three electron domains around it, which 
suggests a trigonal-planar geometry with bond angles of about 
120°. This geometry implies sp2 hybrid orbitals on C (Table 9.4). 
These hybrids are used to make the two C ¬H and one C ¬ O s 
bonds to C
