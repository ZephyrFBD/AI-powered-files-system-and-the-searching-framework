eably, a polypeptide is technically a polymer of amino acids,
whereas the term protein is used for a polypeptide or polypeptides that have combined together, often have bound non-
peptide prosthetic groups, have a distinct shape, and have a unique function. After protein synthesis (translation), most
proteins are modified. These are known as post-translational modifications. They may undergo cleavage or phosphorylation,
or may require the addition of other chemical groups. Only after these modifications is the protein completely functional.

Why is the process of protein synthesis critical to life?
a.
Protein is the bodyâ€™s preferred source for energy for rapid energy production.
b.
Protein is stored in the liver and muscles to supply energy for future use.
c.
Protein is required for tissue formation and constitutes hormones and enzymes.
d.
Proteins are required for th
