9. (II) A 0.140-kg baseball traveling 
strikes the
catcher’s mitt, which, in bringing the ball to rest, recoils
backward 11.0 cm. What was the average force applied by
the ball on the glove?

of the box and the normal force acting on it? (b) A 10.0-kg
box is placed on top of the 20.0-kg box, as shown in 
Fig. 4–43. Determine the normal force that the table exerts
on the 20.0-kg box and the normal force that the 20.0-kg
box exerts on the 10.0-kg box.
