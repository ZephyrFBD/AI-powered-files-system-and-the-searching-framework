Upon compiling his results for many thousands of plants, Mendel concluded that the characteristics could be divided into
expressed and latent traits. He called these, respectively, dominant and recessive traits. Dominant traits are those that are
inherited unchanged in a hybridization. Recessive traits become latent, or disappear, in the offspring of a hybridization.
The recessive trait does, however, reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring. An example of a dominant trait is the
violet-flower trait
