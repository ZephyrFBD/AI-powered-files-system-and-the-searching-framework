). Some of the largest dam removal
projects have yet to occur or have happened too recently for the consequences to be measured. The large-scale ecological
experiments that these removal projects constitute will provide valuable data for other dam projects slated either for removal
or construction.
The Role of Captive Breeding
Zoos have sought to play a role in conservation efforts both through captive breeding programs and education. The
transformation of the missions of zoos from collection and exhibition facilities to organizations that are dedicated to
conservation is ongoing. In general, it has been recognized that, except in some specific targeted cases, captive breeding
programs for endangered species are inefficient and often prone to failure when the species are reintroduced to the wild.
Zoo facilities are far too limited to contemplate captive breeding programs for the numbers of species that are now at
risk. Education is another potential positive impact of zoos on conservat
