up “With CO2.” Fill a second cup with only water to be used as a control 
group. Label this cup “Without CO2.” Throughout the rest of the procedure you will be 
preparing material for both cups, so do everything for both cups simultaneously. 
Step 3 Using a pipette, add one drop of a dilute liquid soap solution to the solution in each 
cup. It is critical to avoid suds. If either solution generates suds, then dilute it with more 
bicarbonate or water solution. The soap acts as a surfactant or “wetting agent” — it wets 
the hydrophobic surface of the leaf, allowing the solution to be drawn into the leaf and 
enabling the leaf disks to sink in the fluid.

Step 4 Using a hole punch, cut 10 or more uniform leaf disks for each cup. Avoid major 
leaf veins. (The choice of plant material is perhaps the most critical aspect of this 
procedure. The leaf surface should be smooth and not too thick.)
