oup 2A: The Alkaline Earth Metals
Like the alkali metals, the alkaline earth metals are all solids at room temperature and 
have typical metallic properties (Table 7.5). Compared with the alkali metals, the alkaline 
earth metals are harder and denser, and melt at higher temperatures.
The first ionization energies of the alkaline earth metals are low but not as low as 
those of the alkali metals. Consequently, the alkaline earth metals are less reactive than 
their alkali metal neighbors. As noted in Section 7.4, the ease with which the elements lose 
electrons decreases as we move across a period and increases as we move down a group. 
Thus, beryllium and magnesium, the lightest alkaline earth metals, are the least reactive.
The trend of increasing reactivity within the group is shown by the way the alka-
line earth metals behave in the presence of water. Beryllium does not react with either 
water or steam, even when heated red-hot. Magnesium reacts slowly with liquid water 
and more
