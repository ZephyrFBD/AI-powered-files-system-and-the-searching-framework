 clear-cut matter. In fact some philosophers of science think the word
“discovery” is often not appropriate, such as in this case.
Electron Charge Measurement
Thomson believed that an electron was not an atom, but rather a constituent,
or part, of an atom. Convincing evidence for this came soon with the determin-
ation of the charge and the mass of the cathode rays. Thomson’s student 
J. S. Townsend made the first direct (but rough) measurements of e in 1897. But
it was the more refined oil-drop experiment of Robert A. Millikan (1868–1953)
that yielded a precise value for the charge on the electron and showed that charge
comes in discrete amounts. In this experiment, tiny droplets of mineral oil carrying
an electric charge were allowed to fall under gravity between two parallel plates,
Fig. 27–3. The electric field E between the plates was adjusted until the drop was
suspended in midair. The downward pull of gravity, mg, was then just balanced by
the upward force due to the electric fi
