lic acid (a carboxylate anion) can exhibit resonance 
 (Section 8.6), which contributes to the stability of the anion by spreading the nega-
tive charge over several atoms:

Give It Some Thought
Is a carboxylate salt likely to produce acidic or basic solutions in water?
Amino acids contain a carboxyl group and can therefore serve as 
acids. They also contain an NH2 group, characteristic of amines (Sec-
tion 16.7), and thus they can also act as bases. Amino acids, therefore, 
are amphiprotic. For glycine, we might expect the acid and base reac-
tions with water to be
Acid: H2N ¬CH2¬ COOH1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆
 
 
 H2N ¬ CH2¬COO-1aq2 + H3O+1aq2 
[16.48]
Base: H2N ¬ CH2¬COOH1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆
 
 
+H3N ¬CH2¬ COOH1aq2 + OH -1aq2 
[16.49]
The pH of a solution of glycine in water is about 6.0, indicating that it 
is a slightly stronger acid than base.
The acid–base chemistry of amino acids is more complicated 
than shown in Equations 16.48 and 16.49, however. Be
