5. A. The process illustrated here is translation. In particular, the anticodon of a tRNA is shown base-pairing with
the codon of the mRNA.
16. B. The DNA of all cells uses the same DNA nucleotidesâ€”adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine nucleotides.
On the other hand, the DNA of two unrelated species is likely to differ considerably in the genes produced as well as
in the number of DNA molecules (that is, the number of chromosomes), the DNA lengths, and the DNA nucleotide
sequences.
17. A. Replication is the process of copying DNA. Protein synthesis involves transcription and translation.
Translation begins with initiation, continues with elongation, and ends with termination.
18. C. The genetic instructions originate on the DNA and are carried to the cytoplasm by the mRNA. The rRNA and
tRNA operate together to translate the code on the mRNA into a polypeptide.
19. A. Plasmids are small circular DNA molecules that a bacterium contains in addition to its primary chromosome.
20. B. DNA
