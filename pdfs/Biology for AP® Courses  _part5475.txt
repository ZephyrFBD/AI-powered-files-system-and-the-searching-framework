wall with red paint in that once two or three coats have been applied
it didn’t maĴer how much more you slapped on because the wall
will not get much redder. Almost all the eﬀect of the rise in Co2 has
already happened, he said, and the volume in the atmosphere would

Climate hoaxers know this and they have invented the most

overcome this rather devastating fact. You hear puppet Greta going

The Sun affects temperature? No you climate denier
Some other nonsense to contemplate: Climate graphs show that rises
in temperature do not follow rises in Co2 – it’s the other way round
with a lag between the two of some 800 years. If we go b
