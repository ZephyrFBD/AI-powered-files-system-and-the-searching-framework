gle bacterial gene while numerous ribosomes concurrently
translate the mRNA transcripts into polypeptides. In this way, a specific protein can rapidly reach a high concentration
in the bacterial cell.
Visit this BioStudio animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/transcription2) to see the process of prokaryotic
transcription.
Why is the stop codon necessary for translation?
a.
The stop codon is the first step in a series of steps to end translation.
b.
The stop codon is necessary to initiate translation.
c.
The stop codon ends translation which allows the polypeptide strand to be released.
d.
The stop codon ends translation in order to initiate transcription.
Activity
Working in small groups, use a model of DNA to demonstrate synthesis transcription of mRNA to other
groups in your class. In your demonstration, be sure to distinguish the differences between DNA and RNA,
the template and non-template strands of the DNA, the directionality of transcription, and the significance of
promoter
