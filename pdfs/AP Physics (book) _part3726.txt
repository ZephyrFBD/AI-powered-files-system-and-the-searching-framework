een in the spectra from
distant galaxies were generally redshifted, and that the amount of shift seemed to
be approximately proportional to the distance of the galaxy from us. That is, the
velocity of a galaxy moving away from us is proportional to its distance d from us:

This is Hubble’s law, one of the most fundamental astronomical ideas. It was first
suggested, in 1927, by Georges Lemaître, a Belgian physics professor and priest,
who also first proposed what later came to be called the Big Bang. The con-
stant
