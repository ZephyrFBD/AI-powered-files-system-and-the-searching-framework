Give It Some Thought
What is the significance of the minus sign in front of ∆E in the above equation?
Knowing the energy of the emitted photon, we can calculate either its frequency 
or its wavelength. For the wavelength, we combine Equations 6.1 1l = c>n2 and 6.3 
1Ephoton = hn2 to obtain
l = c

+1.94 * 10 - 18 J
= 1.02 * 10 - 7 m
Thus, a photon of wavelength 1.02 * 10 - 7 m (102 nm) is emitted.
We are now in a position to understand the remarkable  
simplicity of the line spectra 
of hydrogen, first discovered by Balmer. We recognize that the line spectra are the result 
of emission, so Ephoton = hn = hc>l = -∆E  for these transitions. Combining Equations 6.5 
and 6.6, we see that
Ephoton = hc
