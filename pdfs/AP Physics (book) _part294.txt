1. One car travels due east at 
and a second car travels
north at 
Are their velocities equal? Explain.
2. Can you conclude that a car is not accelerating if its speed-
ometer indicates a steady 
Explain.
3. Give several examples of an objectâ€™s motion in which a great
distance is traveled but the displacement is zero.
4. Can the displacement vector for a particle moving in two
dimensions be longer than the length of path traveled by the
particle over the same time interval? Can it be less? Discuss.
5. During baseball practice, a player hits a very high fly ball
and then runs in a straight line and catches it. Which had
the greater displacement, the player or the ball? Explain.
6. If
is V necessarily greater than 
and/or 
Discuss.
7. Two vectors have length  
and  
What are the maximum and minimum magnitudes of their
vector sum?
8. Can two vectors, of unequal magnitude, add up to give the zero
vector? Can three unequal vectors? Under what conditions?
9. Can the magnitude of a ve
