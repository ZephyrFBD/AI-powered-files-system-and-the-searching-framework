*91. The level of liquid helium (temperature
) in its storage
tank can be monitored using a vertically aligned niobium–
titanium (NbTi) wire, whose length 
spans the height of
the tank. In this level-sensing setup, an electronic circuit
maintains a constant electrical current I at all times in the
NbTi wire and a voltmeter monitors the voltage differ-
ence V across this wire. Since the superconducting critical
temperature for NbTi is 10 K, the portion of the wire
immersed in the liquid helium is in the superconducting
state, while the portion above the liquid (in helium vapor
with temperature above 10 K) is in the normal state. Define
to be the fraction of the tank filled with liquid
helium (Fig. 18–38) and 
to be the value of V when the
tank is empty
