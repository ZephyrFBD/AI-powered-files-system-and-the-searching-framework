When waves reflect from an obstacle, the angle of incidence
equals the angle of reflection (Fig. 11–36). The same is true of particles—think
of a tennis ball without spin striking a flat surface.
The law of refraction is another matter. Consider a ray of light entering a
medium where it is bent toward the normal, as when traveling from air into water.
As shown in Fig. 24–3, this bending can be constructed using Huygens’ principle if
we assume the speed of light is less in the second medium 
In time ,
point B on wave front AB (perpendicular to the incoming ray) travels a distance 
to reach point D. Point A on the wave front, traveling in the second medium, goes
a distance 
to reach point C, and 
Huygens’ principle is applied to
points A and B to obtain the curved wavelets shown at C and D. The wave front is
tangent to these two wavelets, so the new wave front is the line CD. Hence the rays,
which are perpendicular to the wave fronts, bend toward the normal if
as drawn. (This is basicall
