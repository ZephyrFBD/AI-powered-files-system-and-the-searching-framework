 and “C terminus” mean. How many different 
peptides can be made from your three different amino acids?
 12.91  (a) What molecular features make a polymer flexible? (b) If 
you cross-link a polymer, is it more flexible or less flexible 
than it was before?
 12.92  What molecular structural features cause high-density poly-
ethylene to be denser than low-density polyethylene?
 12.93  If you want to make a polymer for plastic wrap, should you 
strive to make a polymer that has a high or low degree of 
crystallinity?
 12.94  Indicate whether each statement is true or false:
(a) Elastomers are rubbery solids.
(b) Thermosets cannot be reshaped.
(c) Thermoplastic polymers can be recycled.
Nanomaterials (Section 12.9)
 12.95  Explain why “bands” may not be the most accurate descrip-
tion of bonding in a solid when the solid has nanoscale 
dimensions.
 12.96  CdS has a band gap of 2.4 eV. If large crystals of CdS are il-
luminated with ultraviolet light, they emit light equal to 
the band gap
