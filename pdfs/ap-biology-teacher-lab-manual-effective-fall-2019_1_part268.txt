stigation, you will use BLAST to compare several genes, 
and then use the information to construct a cladogram. A cladogram (also called a 
phylogenetic tree) is a visualization of the evolutionary relatedness of species. Figure 1 is 
a simple cladogram.

Figure 1. Simple Cladogram Representing Different Plant Species
Note that the cladogram is treelike, with the endpoints of each branch representing a 
specific species. The closer two species are located to each other, the more recently they 
share a common ancestor. For example, Selaginella (spikemoss) and Isoetes (quillwort) 
share a more recent common ancestor than the common ancestor that is shared by all 
three organisms.
Figure 2 includes additional details, such as the evolution of particular physical 
structures called shared derived characters. Note that the placement of the derived 
characters corresponds to when (in a general, not a specific, sense) that character 
evolved;
