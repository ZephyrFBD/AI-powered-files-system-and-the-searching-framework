.3 to 0.5% COHb in her or his blood. This 
amount arises mainly from the production of small quantities 
of CO in the course of normal body chemistry and from the 
small amount of CO present in clean air. Exposure to higher 
concentrations of CO causes the COHb level to increase, which

in porphine and bond with all four nitrogens in heme b and 
chlorophyll a, respectively.

in turn leaves fewer Hb sites to which O2 can bind. If the level of COHb becomes too 
high, oxygen transport is effectively shut down and death occurs. Because
