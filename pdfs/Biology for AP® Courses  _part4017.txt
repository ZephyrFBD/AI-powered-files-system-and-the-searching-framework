The diagram shows the normal feedback loop that controls
the production of thyroid hormones in the human body.
Graves’ disease is an autoimmune disease in which the
body produces autoantibodies to the TSH receptor. When
these autoantibodies bind to the receptor, it mimics the
action of the TSH hormone. How would the feedback loop
and the regulated production of thyroid hormones shown
in the diagram be affected in a person with Graves’
disease?
a.
The feedback loop would be disrupted.
Autoantibodies would bind to the TSH
receptors, allowing them to continue to produce
thyroid hormones. As a result, there would be an
overproduction of thyroid hormones because the
negative feedback system would be unable to
function.
b.
The feedback loop would be not be disrupted.
Autoantibodies would bind to the TSH
receptors, allowing them to continue to produce
thyroid hormones. As a result, there would be an
overproduction of thyroid hormones because the
