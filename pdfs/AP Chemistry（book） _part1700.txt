ater so efficiently? Although 
this plant’s self-cleaning nature has been known for millennia, the 
effect was not fully understood until the 1970s when scanning electron 
microscopy images revealed a rough leaf surface (Figure 11.1). The rough 
surface helps minimize contact between water and leaf, and also mini-
mizes contact between dirt and leaf so that dirt does not stick.

Another important factor contributing to the plant’s 
self-cleaning nature is the contrast between the molecular compo-
sition of the leaf and that of the water. The leaf is coated by hydro-
carbon molecules, which are not attracted to water molecules. As a 
result the water molecules preferentially surround themselves with 
other water molecules, thereby minimizing contact with the leaf.
The lotus effect has inspired scientists to design superhydro-
phobic surfaces for applications such as self-cleaning windows 
and water-repellent clothing. To understand the lotus effect and 
other phenomena involving liq
