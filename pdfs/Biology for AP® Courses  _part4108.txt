tely disengaged from the uterine
wall. If labor should stop before stage two is reached, synthetic oxytocin can be administered to restart and maintain labor.
An alternative to labor and delivery is the surgical delivery of the baby through a procedure called a Caesarian section. This
is major abdominal surgery and can lead to post-surgical complications for the mother, but in some cases it may be the only
way to safely deliver the baby.
The mother’s mammary glands go through changes during the third trimester to prepare for lactation and breastfeeding.
When the baby begins suckling at the breast, signals are sent to the hypothalamus causing the release of prolactin from the
anterior pituitary. Prolactin causes the mammary glands to produce milk. Oxytocin is also released, promoting the release
of the milk. The milk contains nutrients for the baby’s development and growth as well as immunoglobulins to protect the
child from bacterial and viral infections.
