reduces the number of cells in mitosis, and thus a group with only colchicine added would have even fewer
cells in mitosis than the control group had.
12. (a) Replication of chromosomes occurs during the S stage of interphase. Alignment of chromosomes occurs
during metaphase of mitosis. Separation of chromosomes occurs during anaphase of mitosis.
(b) Molecule I represents the concentration of cyclin-dependent kinases because it is at a constant level
throughout the cell cycle. Molecule II represents the concentration of cyclins because its level peaks just
before the start of mitosis and then falls off rapidly during mitosis.
(c) Mitosis-promoting factor (MPF) triggers the start of mitosis. Mitosis-promoting factor forms when cyclins
bind to cyclin-dependent kinases. The arrow shows the point at which there is enough cyclin to form the
MPF needed to trigger the start of mitosis.
(d) If a cancer cell had a mutation that resulted in the constant high production of cyclins (Molecule
