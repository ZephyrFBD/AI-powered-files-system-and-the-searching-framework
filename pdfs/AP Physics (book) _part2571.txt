ost useful equation in geometric optics.
(Interestingly, it is exactly the same as the mirror equation, Eq. 23–2.)
If the object is at infinity, then 
so
Thus the focal length is
the image distance for an object at infinity, as mentioned earlier.

SECTION 23–8
The Thin Lens Equation
665
We can derive the lens equation for a diverging lens using Fig. 23–41. Trian-
gles 
and 
are similar; and triangles 
and AFB are similar. Thus
(noting that length
)
and
When we equate the right sides of these two equations and simplify, we obtain
This equation becomes the same as Eq. 23–8 if we make f and 
negative. That is,
we take f to be negative for a diverging lens, and 
negative when the image is on
the same side of the lens as the light comes from. Thus Eq. 23–8 will be valid for
both converging and diverging lenses, and for all situations, if we use the follow-
