Connection for AP® Courses
Much of the information in this module is not within the scope of AP®. However, when we explored concepts about
biological molecules in the chapter on biological macromolecules, we learn how macromolecules—carbohydrates, lipids,
proteins, and nucleic acids—are synthesized from monomers. During digestion, these polymers are broken down into
monomers, which are then absorbed and transported to all cells of the body. In the Digestive Systems module, we described
the fate of the ingredients of a sandwich as they pass through the digestive tract. Food is ingested through the mouth, and
digestion and absorption occur in a series of steps, with special enzy
