 to amplify and/or regulate their signal transduction. In
some cases, a measure of safety requires that two diﬀerent receptors on
the cell surface become activated to turn on a particular intracellular
protein. In other cases, signals at diﬀerent receptors lead to the
phosphorylation of diﬀerent proteins that activate together only when
both proteins have been phosphorylated. This signal integration leads to
a measure of control over reactions and the ability to use multiple inputs
to cause a certain eﬀect that can vary in degree.
Signal transduction pathways that are blocked or defective can be
deleterious (harmful) or prophylactic (preventative). For example, type I
and type II diabetes arise from blocked signal transduction and blocked

signal reception, respectively. Normally, the pancreas releases insulin,
which signals liver, muscle, and fat cells to store sugar. In type I diabetes,
pancreatic cells that produce insulin are destroyed by the immune
system, s
