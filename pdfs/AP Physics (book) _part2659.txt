 of the slit will travel one-half
wavelength farther than the ray at the bottom of the slit. These two rays will be
exactly out of phase with one another and so will destructively interfere when
they overlap at the screen. Similarly, a ray slightly above the bottom one will cancel
a ray that is the same distance above the central one. Indeed, each ray passing
through the lower half of the slit will cancel with a corresponding ray passing
through the upper half. Thus, all the rays destructively interfere in pairs, and so
the light intensity will be zero on the viewing screen at this angle. The angle at
which this takes place can be seen from Fig. 24–20b to occur when
so
(24;3a)
The light intensity is a maximum at 
and decreases to a minimum
at the angle given by Eq. 24–3a.
Now consider a larger angle such that the top ray travels 
farther than the
bottom ray, as in Fig. 24–20c. In this case, the rays from the bottom third of the
slit will cancel in pairs with those in the middle third b
