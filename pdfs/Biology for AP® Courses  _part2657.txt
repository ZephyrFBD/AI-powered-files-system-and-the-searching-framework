m = Ψtotal = Ψs + Ψp + Ψg + Ψm
where Ψs, Ψp, Ψg, and Ψm refer to the solute, pressure, gravity, and matric potentials, respectively. “System” can refer to
the water potential of the soil water (Ψsoil), root water (Ψroot), stem water (Ψstem), leaf water (Ψleaf) or the water in the
atmosphere (Ψatmosphere): whichever aqueous system is under consideration. As the individual components change, they
raise or lower the total water potential of a system. When this happens, water moves to equilibrate, moving from the system
or compartment with a higher water potential to the system or compartment with a lower water potential. This brings the
difference in water potential between the two systems (ΔΨ) back to zero (ΔΨ = 0). Therefore, for water to move through
the plant from the soil to the air (a process called transpiration), Ψsoil must be > Ψroot > Ψstem > Ψleaf > Ψatmosphere.
Water only moves in response to ΔΨ, not in response to the individual components. However, because the individual
