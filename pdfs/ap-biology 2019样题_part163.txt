eron 
in E.Â coli to help them understand the 
significance of positive gene regulation. 
Often on the exam, students fail to provide 
reasoning connecting a change on the 
molecular level (e.g., a mutation) to a change 
in phenotype (e.g., an increase or decrease in 
protein levels). Students should understand 
that the location of a mutation in the codon 
can affect the structure and function of a 
protein. Common errors include stating 
that mutations result in the denaturation 
of a protein or that point mutations cause 
frameshift mutations. Students also tend to 
describe all mutations as having negative 
effects; exposure to examples of mutations 
that have no impact on phenotype can help 
prevent this misunderstanding.
Developing Understanding
Progressing from the continuity of life to gene expression, in Unit 6 students gain  
in-depth knowledge about nucleic acids and their role in gene expression. Students 
receive a finer focus on the comparison between the structures of DNA
