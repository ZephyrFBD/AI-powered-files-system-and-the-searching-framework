 nucleotides on the mRNA, called a codon, codes for one
specific amino acid. Since there are 64 possible ways that four nucleotides can be arranged in triplet combinations (4
× 4 × 4 = 64), there are 64 possible codons. However, there are only 20 amino acids, and thus, some codons code for
the same amino acid. The genetic code, given in Figure 9-4, provides the decoding for each codon. That is, it
identifies the amino acid specified by each of the possible 64 codon combinations. For example, the codon
composed of the three nucleotides cytosine-guanine-adenine (CGA) codes for the amino acid arginine. This can be
found in Figure 9-4 by aligning the C found in the first column with the G in the center part of the table and the A in
the column at the far right. Note that three of the codons in the genetic code are stop codons. They signal an end to
translation rather than code for an amino acid. Therefore, only 61 of the codons actually code for amino acids. The
codon that codes for the am
