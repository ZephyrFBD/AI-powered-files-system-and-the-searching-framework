subpixel is at 
. If the TFT gate is at 
(horizontal wire activated), the data stream voltage is applied 
to the back of the subpixel, and determines the brightness of that
subpixel. If the gate is at 
(horizontal wire not activated), the
TFT is “off”: no charge passes through, and the capacitance
helps maintain
until the subpixel is updated
later.

The electric potential V at any point in space is defined as the
electric potential energy per unit charge:
(17;2a)
The electric potential difference between any two points 
is defined as the work done to move a 1C electric charge
between the two points. Potential difference is measured in
volts
and is often referred to as voltage.
The change in potential energy when a charge q moves
through a potential difference
