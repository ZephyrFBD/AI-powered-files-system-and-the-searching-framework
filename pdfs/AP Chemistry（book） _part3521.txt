▲ Figure 22.8 Reaction of Cl2 with 
aqueous solutions of NaF
, NaBr, and NaI in 
the presence of carbon tetrachloride. The 
top liquid layer in each vial is water; the 
bottom liquid layer is carbon tetrachloride. 
The Cl21aq2, which has been added to 
each vial, is colorless. The brown color in 
the carbon tetrachloride layer indicates the 
presence of Br2, whereas purple indicates 
the presence of I2.
Write the balanced equation for the reaction, if any, between (a) I -1aq2 and Br21l2, (b) Cl -1aq2 and I21s2.
