only one ion moves through these
channels, they are known as uniport pumps.
As a last example, those ATPases that manufacture ATP in the
mitochondria and chloroplasts, as part of the electron transport chain
are simply ATPase membrane-transport proteins working in a reverse
manner from how they usually work. Rather than ATP hydrolysis driving
changes in protein structure so that ions can pass through the
membrane, it seems that these pumps are driven by the flow of H+ ions
moving through them to synthesize ATP from ADP and an inorganic
phosphate.
Endocytosis and exocytosis are two mechanisms of transport that can
move large molecules and even entire cells through the cell membrane.
To accomplish this, the cell membrane actually invaginates, or pinches
inward, to form a pocket into which the material to be transported can
fall. In the case of endocytosis, this invagination pinches oï¬€ completely,
forming a vesicle that contains the transported material and can move
freely within the cyto
