SECTION 9.6    
Multiple Bonds

resonance Structures, Delocalization, and P Bonding
In the molecules we have discussed thus far in this section, the bonding electrons are 
localized. By this we mean that the s and p electrons are associated totally with the two 
atoms that form the bond. In many molecules, however, we cannot adequately describe 
the bonding as being entirely localized. This situation arises particularly in molecules
