sed by a presynaptic neuron and binds to receptors on a
postsynaptic neuron. When serotonin binds with ligand-gated sodium ion channels, it causes ligand-gated
sodium ion channels on a postsynaptic neuron to open. Sodium ions then diffuse into the postsynaptic
neuron, which results in a nerve impulse being sent. Serotonin is then taken up by the presynaptic neuron.
Based on the figures above and the information provided, what is the result of taking the antidepressant
drug?
(A) The antidepressant drug will cause serotonin to be taken up by the presynaptic neuron more quickly.
(B) The antidepressant drug will cause serotonin to remain in the synapse longer.
(C) The antidepressant drug blocks the sodium ion channels and no nerve impulses can be sent.
(D) The antidepressant drug causes more serotonin to be released from the presynaptic neuron.
Cortisol is a mammalian hormone released in response to stress. When released, cortisol causes the
nervous system to cause a “fight” or “flight” re
