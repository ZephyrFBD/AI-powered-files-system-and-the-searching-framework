f the week, the plants in groups II and III were
dried and the mass was determined. The experimental results are provided in the table.
(a) To explain the increase in mass of the light-grown plants, identify ONE inorganic source of new plant mass
and connect it to the cellular process underlying the increase in mass. 
(b) To explain the decrease in mass of the dark-grown plants, identify the overall chemical reaction that is 
occurring in the plant cells and connect it to the cellular process underlying the decrease in mass.

 A scientist studying the effect of a stimulus on a motor neuron observed that the permeability of the plasma 
membrane of the neuron changes during an action potential. The curves in Figure 1 represent the changes
