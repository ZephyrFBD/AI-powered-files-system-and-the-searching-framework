incubated within a certain temperature range, or females at a
different temperature range.
Figure 19.7 The sex of the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is determined by the temperature at which
the eggs are incubated. Eggs incubated at 30°C produce females, and eggs incubated at 33°C produce males. (credit:

Geographic separation between populations can lead to differences in the phenotypic variation between those populations.
Such geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant. One type of geographic variation,
called a cline, can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient. Species of warm-
blooded animals, for example, tend to have larger bodies in the cooler climates closer to the earth’s poles, allowing them to
better conserve heat. This is considered a latitudinal cline. Alternatively, flowering plants tend to bloom at different times
depending on where they are along
