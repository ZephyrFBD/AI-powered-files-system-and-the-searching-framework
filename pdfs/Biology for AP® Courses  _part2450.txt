he organisms that populate a biofilm, together with their protective exopolysaccharidic (EPS)
environment, make these communities more robust than free-living, or planktonic, prokaryotes. The sticky substance
that holds bacteria together also excludes most antibiotics and disinfectants, making biofilm bacteria hardier than their

planktonic counterparts. Overall, biofilms are very difficult to destroy because they are resistant to many common forms of
sterilization.
Figure 22.8 Five stages of biofilm development are shown. During stage 1, initial attachment, bacteria adhere to
a solid surface via weak van der Waals interactions. During stage 2, irreversible attachment, hairlike appendages
called pili permanently anchor the bacteria to the surface. During stage 3, maturation I, the biofilm grows through
cell division and recruitment of other bacteria. An extr
