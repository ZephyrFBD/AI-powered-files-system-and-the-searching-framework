We can extend the work-energy principle (discussed in Section 6–3) to include
potential energy. Suppose several forces act on an object which can undergo
translational motion. And suppose only some of these forces are conservative.
We write the total (net) work 
as a sum of the work done by conservative
forces,
and the work done by nonconservative forces,
Then, from the work-energy principle, Eq. 6–4, we have
where  
Then
Work done by a conservative force can be written in terms of potential energy,
as we saw in Eq. 6–7b for gravitational potential energy:
We combine these last two equations:
(6;10)
Thus, the work
done by the nonconservative forces acting on an object is
equal to the total change in kinetic and potential energies.
It must be emphasized that all the forces acting on an object must be included
in Eq. 6–10, either in the potential energy term on the right (if it is a conserva-
tive force), or in the work term on the left (but not in both!).
