SEXUAL REPRODUCTION
Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of two haploid gametes (n) to
form a diploid (2n) cell called a zygote. The animal that develops from the
gametes produces gametes by meiosis. The female gamete (the egg or ova)
is large and nonmotile, while the male gamete (sperm) is much smaller

and motile. Although there are some exceptions, for most animals,
reproduction is entirely or primarily sexual.
Sexual reproduction is, energetically speaking, expensive. Animals
must maintain many structures and systems related to producing offspring,
including:
Separate and elaborate male and female reproductive organs
Endocrine glands and complex hormonal cycles
Systems for timing reproductive cycles around environmental
changes
Despite its complexity, sexual reproduction has one major advantage
over asexual reproduction: variation. Each offspring is the product of bot
