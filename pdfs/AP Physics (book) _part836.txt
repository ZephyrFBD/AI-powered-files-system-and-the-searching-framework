l around the axle, retarding
the motion, as suggested by 
in Fig. 8–21. We are given only its torque,
which is what we need. Two other forces could be included in the diagram:
the force of gravity mg down and whatever force keeps the axle in place
(they balance each other). They do not contribute to the torque (their lever
arms are zero) and so we omit them to keep our diagram simple.
4. Determine the torques. The cord exerts a force 
that acts at the edge of the
pulley, so its lever arm is R. The torque exerted by the cord equals 
and 
is counterclockwise, which we choose to be positive. The frictional torque is
given as  
it opposes the motion and is negative.
5. Apply Newton’s second law for rotation. The net torque is
The angular acceleration 
is found from the given data that it takes 3.00 s to
accelerate the pulley from rest to
Newton’s second law,
can be solved for I which is the unknown:
6. Other calculations: None needed.
7. Solve for unknowns. From Newton’s second law,
