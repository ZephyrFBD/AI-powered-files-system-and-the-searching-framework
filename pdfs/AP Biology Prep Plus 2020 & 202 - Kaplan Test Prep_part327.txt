 stimulatory response resulting in the upregulation of DNA
repair protein production
(D)
10. Cellular interaction is an integral part of proper functioning in
both single-celled and multi-celled organisms. Cells communicate
by using a variety of molecules known as hormones. Although
diﬀerent hormones utilize diﬀerent mechanisms of action, all of
the subsequent responses that they produce can be labelled as
either stimulatory or inhibitory. Which of the following correctly
identifies an inhibitory eﬀect of α factor recognition by an a cell?
The increased production of a protein that decreases the
duration of interphase
(A)
The decreased production of a protein that increases the
duration of interphase
(B)
The increased production of a protein that increases the
duration of interphase
(C)
