hypotheses can stimulate the design of 
experiments to learn more about the system being studied. Scien-
tific creativity comes into play in thinking of hypotheses that are 
fruitful in suggesting good experiments to do, ones that will shed 
new light on the nature of the system.
a Closer look The Scientific Method
As more information is gathered, the initial hypotheses get 
winnowed down. Eventually, just one may stand out as most 
 
consistent with a body of accumulated evidence. We then 
 
begin to call this hypothesis a  theory, a model that has predictive 
powers and that accounts for all the available observations. A 
theory also generally is consistent with other, perhaps larger and 
more general theories. For example, a theory of what goes on in-
side a volcano has to be consistent with more general theories re-
garding heat transfer, chemistry at high temperature, and so forth.
We will be encountering many theories as we proceed 
through this book. Some of them have been found
