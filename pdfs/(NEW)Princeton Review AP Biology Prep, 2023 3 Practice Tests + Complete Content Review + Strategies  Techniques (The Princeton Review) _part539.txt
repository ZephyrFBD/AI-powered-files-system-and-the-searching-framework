ns that reside on the plasma membrane. Choice
(C) is also incorrect because bacteria use transcription factors. Choice (D) is possible, but (A) is the best
answer.
8.
C
Choice (A) is likely incorrect. Choice (B) would be deleterious for the cell. Choice (D) is also incorrect, as
DNA replication occurs only during or preceding binary fission.
9.
B
Viruses do not have their own ribosomes, flagella, or independent metabolism, so (A), (C), and (D) are
incorrect. The only possible answer is (B).
10. C
Transformation occurs when bacteria take up DNA from their surroundings. The pathogenic bacteria did not
come alive again, as suggested by (A). Protein was not the transforming agent, so (B) is incorrect. Finally, (D)
does not make sense, as genes cannot turn into other genes simply by being in a different cell context.
11. C
If there are DNA/RNA fragments, then helicase, (A), is present and has opened the strands. RNA primase, (D),
is also present because RNA primers have been added. DNA poly
