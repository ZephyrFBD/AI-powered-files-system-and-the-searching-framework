ive Assessment 
Have students consider the following when analyzing the gene sequences: 
•  The higher the score, the closer the alignment. 
•  The lower the e value, the closer the alignment. 
•  Sequences with e values less than 1e-04 (1 x 10-4) can be considered related with an 
error rate of less than 0.01%. 
Students should analyze and discuss the data and try to form logical hypotheses based 
on evidence. While the evidence is leading toward a close relatedness with birds and/or 
reptiles, you should assess students on their understanding of cladogram construction, 
in general, and the evidence they use to defend their hypothesis. 
The following questions are suggested as guidelines to assess students’ understanding 
of the concepts presented in the investigation, but you are encouraged to develop your 
own methods of postlab assessment: 
•  Are students able to make predictions about where the fossil species could be placed 
on the cladogram based on information they collected f
