erpetuate the species.
Figure 36.6 Survivorship curves show the distribution of individuals in a population according to age. Humans and
most mammals have a Type I survivorship curve because death primarily occurs in the older years. Birds have a Type
II survivorship curve, as death at any age is equally probable. Trees have a Type III survivorship curve because very
few survive the younger years, but after a certain age, individuals are much more likely to survive.
Activity
Design an investigation that a researcher might use to determine the size of a penguin population in the
Antarctic using the mark and release method. What biotic or abiotic factors might influence the size of the
penguin population in a given area?
Section Summary
Populations are individuals of a species that live in a particular habitat. Ecologists measure characteristics of populations:
size, density, dispersion pattern, age structure, and sex ratio. Life tables are useful to calculate life expectancies of indivi
