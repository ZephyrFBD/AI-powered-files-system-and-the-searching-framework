 reactions by using 
tabulated S° values from Appendix C. In each case, explain 
the sign of ∆S°.

(b) 2 Fe2O31s2 ¡ 4 Fe1s2 + 3 O21g2
(c) CaCO31s, calcite2 + 2 HCl1g2 ¡
CaCl21s2 + CO21g2 + H2O1l2

Gibbs Free Energy (Sections 19.5 and 19.6)
 19.53  (a) For a process that occurs at constant temperature, does 
the change in Gibbs free energy depend on changes in the 
enthalpy and entropy of the system? (b) For a certain pro-
cess that occurs at constant T and P, the value of ∆G is pos-
itive. Is the process spontaneous? (c) If ∆G for a process is 
large, is the rate at which it occurs fast?
 19.63  Classify each of the following reactions as one of the four 
possible types summarized in Table 19.3: (i) spontanous 
at all temperatures; (ii) not spontaneous at any tempera-
ture; (iii) spontaneous at low T but not spontaneous at 
high T; (iv) spontaneous at high T but not spontaneous at 
low T.
(a) N21g2 + 3 F21g2 ¡ 2 NF31g2
