re reactions in chemistry is called the 
Ugi reaction: 
 
 R1C(=O)R2 + R3 - NH2 + R4COOH + R5NC S  
R4C(=O)N(R3)C(R1R2)C=ONHR5 + H2O
These exercises require skills from earlier chapters as well as skills 
from the present chapter.
 3.106 The semiconductor gallium arsenide, GaAs, is used in high-
speed integrated circuits, light-emitting diodes, and solar 
cells. Its density is 5.32 g/cm3. It can be made by reacting 
trimethylgallium, (CH3)3Ga, with arsine gas, AsH3. The 
other product of the reaction is methane, CH4. (a) If you 
reacted 450.0 g of trimethylgallium with 300.0 g of arsine, 
what mass of GaAs could you make? (b) Which reactant, if 
any, would be left over, and how many moles of the leftover 
reactant would remain? (c) One application of GaAs uses it 
as a thin film. If you take the mass of GaAs from part (a) and 
make a 40-nm thin film from it, what area, in cm2, would it 
cover? Recall that 1 nm = 1 * 10-9 m.
