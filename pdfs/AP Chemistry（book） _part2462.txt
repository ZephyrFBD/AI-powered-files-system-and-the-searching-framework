y deduced. For example, if the volume of 
the system is reduced, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that 
decreases the number of gas molecules. While changes in concentra-
tion or pressure lead to shifts in the equilibrium concentrations, they 
do not change the value of the equilibrium constant, K.
Changes in temperature affect both the equilibrium concentrations 
and the equilibrium constant. We can use the enthalpy change for a 
reaction to determine how an increase in temperature affects the equi-
librium: For an endothermic reaction, an increase in temperature shifts 
the equilibrium to the right; for an exothermic reaction, a temperature 
increase shifts the equilibrium to the left. Catalysts affect the speed at 
which equilibrium is reached but do not affect the magnitude of K.
