 added to the buffer.
 17.24  A buffer is prepared by adding 10.0 g of ammonium chlo-
ride 1NH4Cl2 to 250 mL of 1.00 M NH3 solution. (a) What 
is the pH of this buffer? (b) Write the complete ionic equa-
tion for the reaction that occurs when a few drops of nitric 
acid are added to the buffer. (c) Write the complete ionic 
equation for the reaction that occurs when a few drops of 
potassium hydroxide solution are added to the buffer.
 17.25  You are asked to prepare a pH = 3.00 buffer solution start-
ing from 1.25 L of a 1.00 M solution of hydrofluoric acid 
(HF) and any amount you need of sodium fluoride (NaF). 
(a) What is the pH of the hydrofluoric acid solution prior 
to adding sodium fluoride? (b) How many grams of sodium 
fluoride should be added to prepare the buffer solution? 
Neglect the small volume change that occurs when the so-
dium fluoride is added.
 17.26  You are asked to prepare a pH = 4.00 buffer start-
ing from 1.50 L of 0.0200 M solution of benzoic acid
