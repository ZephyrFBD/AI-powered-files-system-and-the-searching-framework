d a positive pole. As the DNA fragments move away from the
negative terminal of the charge applied, they get tangled in the jungle.
The smaller the fragments of DNA, the faster they can move through the
tangle. The movement of the fragments can be adjusted by changing the
density of the gel (the tangles in the jungle) or by changing the quantity
of charge (the pushing/pulling power) applied to the gel.
13.7 Investigate analysis of DNA
Restriction enzymes are manufactured by molecular genetics
laboratories to have a high specificity for a series of base pairs on a strand
of DNA or RNA. When the enzyme finds and binds to these base pairs, it
snips the DNA. The more this series of base pairs appears on the DNA or
RNA strand, the more cuts the restriction enzyme makes in the strand.
Aȇer the strand is digested by the restriction enzyme, the fragments with
diﬀerent lengths can be separated using gel electrophoresis. This
technique is commonly used to determine genetic diﬀerences between
