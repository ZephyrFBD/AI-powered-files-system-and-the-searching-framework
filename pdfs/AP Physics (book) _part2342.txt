transmission
Transformers play an important role in the transmission of electricity. Power
plants are often situated some distance from metropolitan areas, so electricity
must then be transmitted over long distances (Fig. 21–25). There is always some
power loss in the transmission lines, and this loss can be minimized if the power is
transmitted at high voltage, using transformers, as the following Example shows.
Transmission lines. An average of 120 kW of electric
power is sent to a small town from a power plant 10 km away. T
