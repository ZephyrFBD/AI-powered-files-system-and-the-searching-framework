to yield the remaining amino acids and the nucleic
acids because of the absence of critical chemical substrates that would have existed on the primordial Earth
due to volcanism. Which of the following basic compounds, which are associated with volcanism, would NOT
need to be added in a follow-up Miller-Urey experiment?
(A) H2S (gas)
(B) SiO2 (silica)
(C) SO2
(D) H3PO4 (phosphoric acid)
10. A radioactive isotope of hydrogen, 3H, is called tritium. Tritium differs from the more common form of
hydrogen because
(A) it contains two neutrons and one proton in its nucleus
(B) it contains one neutron and two protons in its nucleus
(C) it differs by its atomic number
(D) it is radioactive and therefore gives off one electron
Summary
Compounds are composed of two or more types of elements in a fixed ratio.
Molecules are held together by ionic bonds and covalent bonds.
Hydrogen bonding is essential for the following emergent properties of water:
cohesion
adhesion
surface tension
high heat capacit
