 Proteins for Active Transport
An important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate
movement: there are three types of these proteins or transporters (Figure 5.17). A uniporter carries one specific ion or
molecule. A symporter carries two different ions or molecules, both in the same direction. An antiporter also carries two
different ions or molecules, but in different directions. All of these transporters can also transport small, uncharged organic
molecules like glucose. These three types of carrier proteins are also found in facilitated diffusion, but they do not require
ATP to work in that process. Some examples of pumps for active transport are Na+-K+ ATPase, which carries sodium and
potassium ions, and H+-K+ ATPase, which carries hydrogen and potassium ions. Both of these are antiporter carrier proteins.
Two other carrier proteins are Ca2+ ATPase and H+ ATPase, which carry only calcium and only hydrogen ions, res
