nd 
subscript) for each. (b) How many neutrons are in an atom of each isotope?
SOLUTION
(a) Magnesium has atomic number 12, so all atoms of magne-
sium contain 12 protons and 12 electrons. The three isotopes are 
therefore represented by 24
12Mg, 25
12Mg, and 26
12Mg. (b) The number of 
neutrons in each isotope is the mass number minus the number of 
protons. The numbers of neutrons in an atom of each isotope are 
therefore 12, 13, and 14, respectively.

2.4 ∣ Atomic Weights
Atoms are small pieces of matter, so they have mass. In this section, we discuss the mass 
scale used for atoms and introduce the concept of atomic weights.
