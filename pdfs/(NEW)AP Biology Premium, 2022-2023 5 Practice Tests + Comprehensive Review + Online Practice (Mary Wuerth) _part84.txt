 number of aquatic snails in each tube. The dependent
variable is the pH.
(c) The equation for pH (pH = â€“log[H+]) is a logarithmic scale, which means each pH change of 1 unit will
increase the number of H+ ions by a factor of 10. A decrease of 2 pH units would indicate a 100-fold
increase in H+ concentration. Since tube A has a pH of 7.0 after 20 minutes, it makes sense to predict that
tube C, with a pH of 5.0, would have 100 times the H+ concentration as that found in tube A.
(d) In tube A, the pH will increase after 20 minutes. The Elodea in tube A will remove carbon dioxide by the
process of photosynthesis and therefore increase the pH. In tubes B, C, and D, which contain aquatic
animals as well as Elodea, the pH will still decrease after 20 minutes since the animals are performing
cellular respiration. However, since the Elodea will absorb some of the carbon dioxide produced, the
decrease in pH will not be as large as it was when the tubes only contained aquatic snails.
