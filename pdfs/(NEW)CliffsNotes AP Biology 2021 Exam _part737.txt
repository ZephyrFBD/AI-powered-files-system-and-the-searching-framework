 alleles), or phenotypes (such as eye color). To construct a bar
graph, draw a vertical column for each value of the independent variable from the x-axis to a height on the y-axis
that reflects the value of its dependent variable. Other aspects of the bar graph, as described above in items 1-3 and
6, are the same.
Designing an Experiment
A laboratory free-response question may ask you to design an experiment to test a given hypothesis or to solve a
given problem. In many cases, the question will ask you not only to design an experiment, but also to discuss
expected results. Since the form of these questions can vary dramatically, it is not possible to provide a standard
formula for preparing your answer. However, the following list provides important elements that you should include
in your answer if they are appropriate to the question:
1. Identify the independent and dependent variables. The independent variable is the variable you are
manipulating to see how the dependent variable c
