eutzâ€“Taube complex:
(NH3)5RuN

 It is named for the two scientists who discovered it and ini-
tially studied its properties. The central ligand is pyrazine, 
a planar six-membered ring with nitrogens at opposite 
sides. (a) How can you account for the fact that the com-
plex, which has only neutral ligands, has an odd overall 
charge? (b) The metal is in a low-spin configuration in 
both cases. Assuming octahedral coordination, draw the 
d-orbital energy-level diagram for each metal. (c) In many 
experiments the two metal ions appear to be in exactly 
equivalent states. Can you think of a reason that this might 
appear to be so, recognizing that electrons move very rap-
idly compared to nuclei?
 23.82  Solutions of 3Co(NH3)642+, 3Co(H2O)642+ (both octahedral), 
and 3CoCl442- (tetrahedral) are colored. One is pink, one 
is blue, and one is yellow. Based on the spectrochemical 
series and remembering that the energy splitting in tetra-
hedral complexes is normally much less
