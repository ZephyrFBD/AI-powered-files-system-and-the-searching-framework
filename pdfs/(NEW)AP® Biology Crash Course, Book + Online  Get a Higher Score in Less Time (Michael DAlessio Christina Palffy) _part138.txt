Key Concepts
A. Evidence for Evolution
1. Biogeography—study of organisms and how they relate to the environment. Some organisms may be
unique to certain geographies; hence, those organisms have adapted to live in that environment.
2. Fossils—help indicate the progression of organisms from simple to complex. For example,
transitional fossils are fossils of animals that display a trait that helped the organism attain a
competitive advantage. At one time, for example, whales had limb-like appendages indicating they
may have been land dwellers.
3. Comparative Anatomy—study of anatomical similarities between organisms.
i.
Homologous structures—structures in organisms that indicate a common ancestor. For example, a
human arm, cat leg, whale flipper, and bat wing all have a similar structure but different functions.
ii. Vestigial organs—remnants of structures
