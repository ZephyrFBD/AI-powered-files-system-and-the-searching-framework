texture should be more common. Since a pattern
is found in the offspring, and only some of those combinations are present, the traits are likely linked.

The equations of Hardy-Weinberg (p + q = 1 and p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1) should be used. There are 5,300
plants, and 400 of them are pink plants (homozygous recessive). Therefore, the frequency of homozygous
recessive alleles = 400/5,300 = q2 = 0.075 and thus q = 0.27.

If you correctly solved the previous problem, you’re halfway there, as you’ve already found that q = 0.27.
However, here’s that information again. The equations of Hardy-Weinberg (p + q = 1 and p2 + 2pq + q2 =
1) should be used. There are 5,300 plants, and 400 of them are pink plants (homozygous recessive).
Therefore, the frequency of homozygous recessive alleles = 400/5,300 = q2 = 0.075 and thus q = 0.27. If p
+ q = 1, the equation becomes p + 0.27 = 1, or p = 0.73. The frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq, which
becomes 2(0.73) (0.27) = 0.3942 = 39%.
