15. (II) Eight 7.0-W Christmas tree lights are connected in
series to each other and to a 120-V source. What is the
resistance of each bulb?
16. (II) Determine (a) the equivalent resistance of the circuit
shown in Fig.19–48, (b) the voltage across each resistor, and
(c) the current through
each resistor.

23. (III) A 
and a 
resistor are connected in
parallel; this combination is connected in series with a
resistor. If each resistor is rated at 0.5 W (maximum
without overheating), what is the maximum voltage that
can be applied across the whole network?
24. (III) Consider the network of resistors shown in Fig. 19–52.
Answer qualitatively: (a) What happens to the voltage across
each resistor when the switch S is closed? (b) What happens
to the current through each when the
