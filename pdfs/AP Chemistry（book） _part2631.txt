 the equilibrium constant for the reaction 
B1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ HB+1aq2 + OH-1aq2, where B is the base.
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN Ka AND Kb (SECTION 16.8) The 
relationship between the strength of an acid and the strength of 
its conjugate base is expressed quantitatively by the equation 
Ka * Kb = Kw, where Ka and Kb are dissociation constants for con-
jugate acid–base pairs. This equation explains the inverse rela-
tionship between the strength of an acid and the strength of its 
conjugate base.
ACID–BASE PROPERTIES OF SALTS (SECTION 16.9) The acid–
base properties of salts can be ascribed to the behavior of their 
respective cations and anions. The reaction of ions with water, 
with a resulting change in pH, is called hydrolysis. The cations of the 
alkali metals and the alkaline earth metals as well as the anions of 
strong acids, such as Cl-, Br-, I-, and NO3
-, do not undergo hydroly-
sis. They are always spectator ions in acid–base chemistry. A cation 
that is the conjugate acid of a we
