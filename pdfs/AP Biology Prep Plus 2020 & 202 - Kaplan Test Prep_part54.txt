ed of
three components: a pentose sugar (deoxyribose or ribose), a
nitrogenous base that is a purine (adenine and guanine) or pyrimidine
(thymine, cytosine, or uracil), and one or more phosphate groups
attached to the 5’ carbon of the sugar.
Nucleotide monomers join by dehydration synthesis to form nucleic
acids: the 3’ carbon hydroxyl group of the sugar combines with a
hydrogen of the phosphate group of another nucleotide to form a
phosphodiester bond. Like proteins, nucleic acids have distinct ends,
defined by the 3’ and 5’ carbons of the sugar in the nucleotide.
There are two types of nucleic acids: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and
ribonucleic acid (RNA). DNA carries the genetic information living
organisms need to function, grow, and reproduce. Living organisms then
use RNA to carry instructions from DNA for protein synthesis. The
structural diﬀerences between DNA and RNA account for their diﬀering
functions. DNA contains deoxyribose and thymine and is double-
stranded, while RNA co
