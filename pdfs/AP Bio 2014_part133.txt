Question 8  
 
  In 1952 Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase used radioactive phosphorus and radioactive sulfur  
to selectively label the DNA and proteins of bacteriophage T2, a virus that infects bacteria.  
After incubating the labeled bacteriophage particles with Escherichia coli and separating  
extracellular phage particles from the bacteria, Hershey and Chase measured the amounts of 
radioactive phosphorus and sulfur inside infected E. coli cells and in the liquid growth medium  
outside the E. coli cells.  
(a) Predict the experimental result that would best support the claim that DNA is the source of 
heritable inform
