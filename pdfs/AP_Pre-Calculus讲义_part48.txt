2.1 Arithmetic Sequences and Geometric Sequences 
Roughly speaking, a sequence is an infinite list of numbers. The numbers in the sequence 
are often written as a1, a2, a3, . . . . The dots mean that the list continues forever. A simple 
example is the sequence 
 
A sequence is a function a whose domain is the set of natural numbers. The terms of the 
sequence are the function values

We usually write an instead of the function notation a(n). So the terms of the sequence are 
written as
