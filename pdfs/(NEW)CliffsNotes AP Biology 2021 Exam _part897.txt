Question 1 (10 points maximum)
a. (1 point maximum)
1 pt: There would be two fragments.
b. (1 point maximum)
1 pt: 5 Kb (5,000 bp) and 7 Kb (7,000 bp)
c. (1 point maximum)
1 pt: 1 Kb, 2 Kb, 3 Kb, and 6 Kb
d. (4 points maximum)
1 pt: for each correctly positioned fragment (see figure)
e. (1 point maximum)
 
1 pt: All fragments are correctly labeled.
f. (1 point maximum)
1 pt: Because DNA has an overall negative charge from the phosphate groups, the fragments migrate toward the
positive electrode of the electrical current applied.
g. (1 point maximum)
1 pt: The migration of the fragment varies with its length, weight, and charge.
1 pt: The longer, heavier fragments meet more resistance, and, therefore, move more slowly as they migrate through
the gel.
