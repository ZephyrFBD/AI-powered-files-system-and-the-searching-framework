m NADP+. The energy carried in NADPH also is used to power the chemical reactions of the Calvin cycle.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined
in Big Idea 2 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table. The learning objectives listed in
the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory
experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more
of the seven science practices.
Big Idea 2
Biological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,
and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.
Enduring
Understanding
2.A
Growth, reproduction and maintenance of living systems require free energy and matter.
Essential
Knowledge
2.A.2 The light-independent reactions of photosynthesis in eukaryotes involve a series of
reactions that capture free energy
