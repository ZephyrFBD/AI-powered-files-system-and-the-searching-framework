ter
than lighter objects and that the speed of fall is proportional to how heavy the
object is. The speed of a falling object is not proportional to its mass.
Galileo made use of his new technique of imagining what would happen in
idealized (simplified) cases. For free fall, he postulated that all objects would
fall with the same constant acceleration in the absence of air or other resistance.
He showed that this postulate predicts that for an object falling from rest, the
distance traveled will be proportional to the square of the time (Fig. 2–19); that
is,
We can see this from Eq. 2–11b for constant acceleration; but Galileo
was the first to derive this mathematical relation.
To support his claim that falling objects increase in speed as they fall,
Galileo made use of a clever argument: a heavy stone dropped from a height of
2 m will drive a stake into the ground much further than will the same stone
dropped from a height of only 0.2 m. Clearly, the stone must be moving faster
