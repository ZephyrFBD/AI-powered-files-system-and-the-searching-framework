Speciation
The current definition of a species is the biological species concept—that a species is a group of organisms that are
capable of interbreeding and producing viable and fertile offspring. It is important to note that the definition of a
species is a human construct that is meant to help classify organisms. As more data are gathered about an organism,
the definition as to which species it belongs to may change.
Speciation is the evolution of new species. Speciation occurs when two populations are reproductively isolated
from each other. This reproductive isolation prevents interbreeding, and as the environments where these isolated
groups change, the evolution of new species may occur. Speciation can lead to adaptive radiation, the evolution of
organisms into separate species that occupy different ecological niches. Adaptive radiation is evident in Darwin’s
finches in the Galapagos Islands. These finch species are descendants of one species bu
