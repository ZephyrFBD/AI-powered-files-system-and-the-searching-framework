 to the roots. Wrap the root ball of 
the plant(s) in a plastic bag and tie the bag around the base so that only the leaves are 
exposed. (Be sure to remove all flowers and buds.) Do not water your plant any more 
until you finish your experiment! You can also keep the plant in the plastic pot and place 
it in the plastic bag.

Step 3 Determine the mass of each plant and then its mass for several days under your 
environmental condition(s). 
Step 4 Record your data in your lab notebook or as instructed by your teacher. 
â–  Calculations: Determining Surface Area and Transpiration 
Rates 
Step 1 In the first part of this lab, you were asked to investigate methods to calculate leaf 
surface area and the surface area of all the leaves on a plant or plant cutting (depending 
on your experimental setup). Your teacher may suggest a particular method. Determine 
the total surface area of the leaves in cm2 and record the valu
