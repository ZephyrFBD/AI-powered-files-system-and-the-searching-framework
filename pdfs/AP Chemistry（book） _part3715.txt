etism of Coordination Compounds
Many transition-metal complexes exhibit paramagnetism, as described in Sections 9.8 
and 23.1. In such compounds, the metal ions possess some number of unpaired elec-
trons. It is possible to experimentally determine the number of unpaired electrons per 
metal ion from the measured degree of paramagnetism, and experiments reveal some 
interesting comparisons.
Compounds of the complex ion 3Co(CN)643- have no unpaired electrons, for exam-
ple, but compounds of the 3CoF643- ion have four unpaired electrons per metal ion. Both 
complexes contain Co(III) with a 3d6 electron configuration. 
 (Section 7.4) Clearly, 
there is a major difference in the ways in which the electrons are arranged in these two 
cases. Any successful bonding theory must explain this difference, and we present such a 
theory in the next section.

Scientists have long recognized that many of the magnetic properties and colors of 
transition-metal complexes are
