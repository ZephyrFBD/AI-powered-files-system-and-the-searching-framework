e good stability toward heat, light, 
oxygen, and water. They are used commercially in a wide variety of products, including 
lubricants, car polishes, sealants, and gaskets. They are also used for waterproofing fab-
rics. When applied to a fabric, the oxygen atoms form hydrogen bonds with the mole-
cules on the surface of the fabric. The hydrophobic (water-repelling) organic groups of 
the silicone are then left pointing away from the surface as a barrier.
Give It Some Thought
Distinguish among the substances silicon, silica, and silicone.
22.11 ∣ Boron
Boron is the only group 3A element that can be considered nonmetallic and thus is 
our final element in this chapter. The element has an extended network structure with 
a melting point 12300 °C2 that is intermediate between the melting points of carbon 
13550 °C2 and silicon 11410 °C2. The electron configuration of boron is 3He42s22p1.
In the family of compounds called boranes, the molecules contain only boron 
and hydrogen. Because B
