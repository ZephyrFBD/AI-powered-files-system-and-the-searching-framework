not appear in the spectrum; they are
made from a mixture of wavelengths.

Using Eq. 24–2a, we can see that 
is smallest for violet light and largest for red
(Fig. 24–11). By measuring the position of these fringes, Young was the first to
determine the wavelengths of visible light. In doing so, he showed that what
distinguishes different colors physically is their wavelength (or frequency), an
idea put forward earlier by Grimaldi in 1665.
Wavelengths from double-slit interference. White light
passes through two slits 0.50 mm apart, and an interference pattern is observed
on a screen 2.5 m away. The first-order fringe resembles a rainbow with violet
and red light at opposite ends. The violet light is about 2.0 mm and the red 3.5 mm
from the center of the central white fringe (Fig. 24–11). Estimate the wavelengths
for the violet
