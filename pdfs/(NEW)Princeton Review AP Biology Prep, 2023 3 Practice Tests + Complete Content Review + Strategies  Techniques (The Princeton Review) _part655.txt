A ligand binding to a receptor and causing a cellular response is signal transduction. In this case, the ligand is
the pheromone and the response is increased expression of transcription factors. All other answers do not make
sense in this context.

Homologous structures are organisms with the same structure but different functions. The forelegs of an insect
and the forelimbs of a dog are not structurally similar. (One is an invertebrate, and the other a vertebrate.) They
do not share a common ancestor. However, both structures are used for movement, so they are analogous
structures. All of the other examples are vertebrates that are structurally similar.
51. B
Speciation occurred in the Galapagos finches as a result of the different environments on the islands. This is an
example of divergent evolution. The finches were geographically isolated. Choice (A), convergent evolution,
is the evolution of similar
