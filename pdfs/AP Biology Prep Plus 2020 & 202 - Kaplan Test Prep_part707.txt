CHAPTER:
Evolution is shaped by a number of mechanisms, including
selective pressures, sources of variation, and random eﬀects,
such as genetic driȇ.
1.
Biological species concept: a species is a reproductively
isolated population able to interbreed and produce fertile
oﬀspring.
2.
In allopatric speciation, geographically separated populations
develop into diﬀerent species. Sympatric speciation occurs
when populations in the same environment adapt to fill
diﬀerent niches. Parapatric speciation occurs with limited
interbreeding between two groups.
3.
Evidence for evolution comes from comparative anatomy
(homologous and analogous structures), biogeography,
embryology, the fossil record, biological classification, and
molecular biology (relatives share DNA).
