24. Which of the following best describes the
reproductive ability of C. elegans following
the ARD induced in the first experiment?
(A) Mating with a well-fed male consistently
produced more offspring than did 
reproduction via self-fertilization. 
(B) The numbers of progeny produced by 
self-fertilization and by mating with 
well-fed males were not statistically 
different. 
(C) C. elegans stopped reproducing after  
20 days without food. 
(D) There was no relationship between days 
without food and average brood size. 
25. The average brood size per mated individual upon
reintroduction of food following 30 days of ARD
is closest to which of the following?
(A)  10
(B)  50
(C) 250
(D) 400
26. Which of the following conclusions is most
consistent with the data shown in Figure 2 ?
(A) Animals that spend 3–5 days in ARD are
more likely to survive periods of food 
scarcity than are animals that spend  
13–15 days in ARD.
