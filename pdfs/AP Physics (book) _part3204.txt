owest possible energy of a neutron
contained in a typical nucleus of radius 
[Hint: Assume a particle can have an energy as large as its
uncertainty.]
13. (III) How precisely can the position of a 5.00-keV 
electron be measured assuming its energy is known to
1.00%?
14. (III) Use the uncertainty principle to show that if an
electron were present in the nucleus 
its
kinetic energy (use relativity) would be hundreds of MeV.
(Since such electron energies are not observed, we
conclude that electrons are not present in the nucleus.)

6. Which of the following is the best paraphrasing of the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle?
(a) Only if you know the exact position of a particle can
you know the exact momentum of the particle.
(b) The larger the momentum of a particle, the smaller the
position of the particle.
(c) The more precisely you know
