1. A population of rabbits settled in a desert environment where the
soil is covered with small boulders and shrubs. Desert foxes are
the major predators that the rabbits encounter. Small rabbits hide
under rocks and shrubs to avoid detection. Desert foxes usually
avoid large rabbits that can inflict serious wounds by kicking and
biting. Ecologists survey the population size of the rabbits. Which
of the following graphs is most likely to represent the distribution
of body sizes in the rabbit population aȇer several generations?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
2. Research has shown that the glycoly
