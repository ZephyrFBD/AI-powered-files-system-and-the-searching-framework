†Why atoms and molecules emit line spectra was a great mystery for many years and played a central
role in the development of modern quantum theory, as we shall see in Chapter 27.

The Sun’s absorption lines are due to absorption by atoms and molecules in the
cooler outer atmosphere of the Sun, as well as by atoms and molecules in the
Earth
