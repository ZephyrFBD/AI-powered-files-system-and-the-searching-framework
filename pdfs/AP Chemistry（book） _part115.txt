atoms of different elements. For example, notice that the molecules of ethanol and eth-
ylene glycol in Figure 1.1 have different compositions and structures. Ethanol contains 
one oxygen atom, depicted by one red sphere. In contrast, ethylene glycol contains two 
oxygen atoms.
Even apparently minor differences in the composition or structure of molecules 
can cause profound differences in properties. For example, let’s compare ethanol and 
ethylene glycol, which appear in Figure 1
