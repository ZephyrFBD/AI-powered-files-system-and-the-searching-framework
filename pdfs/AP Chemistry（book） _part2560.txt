d is 2.64, but the 
pH of a 0.30 M solution of a strong acid such as HCl is -log10.302 = 0.52. As expected, 
the pH of a solution of a weak acid is higher than that of a solution of a strong acid of the 
same molarity. (Remember, the higher the pH value, the less acidic the solution.)
tells us that for each molecule of CH3COOH that ionizes, one H+1aq2 and one 
CH3COO-1aq2 are formed. Consequently, if x moles per liter of H+1aq2 form at equi-
librium, x moles per liter of CH3COO-1aq2 must also form and x moles per liter of 
CH3COOH must be ionized:

This expression leads to a quadratic equation in x, which we can solve by using either 
an equation-so
