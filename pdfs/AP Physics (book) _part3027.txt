n that this duality of light must be accepted as a 
fact of life. It is referred to as the wave;particle duality. Apparently, light is a
more complex phenomenon than just a simple wave or a simple beam of particles.
To clarify the situation, the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885–1962,
Fig. 27–11) proposed his famous principle of complementarity. It states that to
understand an experiment, sometimes we find an explanation using wave theory
and sometimes using particle theory. Yet we must be aware of both the wave and
particle aspects of light if we are to have a full understanding of light. Therefore
these two aspects of light complement one another.
It is not easy to “visualize” this duality. We cannot readily picture a combina-
tion of wave and particle. Instead, we must recognize that the two aspects of light
are different “faces” that light shows to experimenters.
Part of the difficulty stems from how we think. Visual pictures (or models) in
our minds are based on what we see
