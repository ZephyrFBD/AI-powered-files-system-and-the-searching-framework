within a year.
In succession, existing species change the environment over time, making it more favorable for other species to better adapt to

Ecosystem Dynamics
I.
Key Concepts
A. An ecosystem includes groups of interacting communities and their environment; thus, it includes both
biotic (living) and abiotic (nonliving) components.
B. A trophic level is an organismâ€™s nutritional position in a food chain.
C. Energy flows through an ecosystem in a one-way direction, from the sun to progressively higher trophic

higher levels.
D. In contrast to a stream of energy running through an ecosystem, nutrients and water are recycled in an
ecosystem.
E. Exponential growth of the human population has had ef
