e are two nodal planes for each of the 
d-orbitals. For the dxy orbital the nodal planes are the xz and yz 
planes. Figure 6.25 The 4d and 4f subshells are not shown.

Figure 7.1 These three metals do not readily react with other ele-
ments, especially oxygen, so they are often found in nature in the ele-
mental form as metals (such as gold nuggets) Figure 7.4 Because 
of the peak near the nucleus in the 2s curve there is a higher prob-
ability of finding a 2s within 0.5 Å of the nucleus. In a multielectron 
atom an electron in a 2s orbital will have a lower energy than one 
in a 2p orbital. Figure 7.7 Bottom and left Figure 7.8 They get 
larger, just like the atoms do. Figure 7.10 900 kJ>mol  
Figure 7.11 There is more electron–electron repulsion in the case of 
oxygen because two electrons have to occupy the same orbital.  
Figure 7.12 The added electron for the Group 4A elements leads to 
a half-filled np3 configuration. For the Group 5A elements, the a
