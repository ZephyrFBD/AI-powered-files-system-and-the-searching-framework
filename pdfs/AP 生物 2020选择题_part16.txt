individuals with the mutation? 
(A) Cells use lactic acid to shunt electrons 
from pyruvate to the electron transport 
chain in the mitochondria. 
(B) Cells undergo glycolysis because there is a 
buildup of pyruvate in affected 
individuals. 
(C) Cells cannot transport pyruvate to the 
mitochondria in the absence of pyruvate 
dehydrogenase activity, so the pyruvate is 
broken down to lactic acid and ethanol. 
(D) Cells undergo fermentation because 
pyruvate cannot be metabolized to 
proceed into the Krebs cycle. 
9. The diagram shows how water can adhere to the 
xylem in the stems of plants, which contributes 
to water movement in the plant. Which of the 
following best explains how water is able to 
move upward from the roots of a plant, through 
its xylem in the stem, and out to the leaves? 
(A) Water is polar, and the walls of the xylem 
are nonpolar. Water molecules have the 
ability to form hydrogen bonds with one 
another but not with the xylem walls. 
(B) Water is nonpolar, and
