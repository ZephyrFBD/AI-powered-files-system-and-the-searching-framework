1. Physical state of the reactants. Reactants must come together to react. The more read-
ily reactant molecules collide with one another, the more rapidly they react. Reactions 
may broadly be classified as homogeneous, involving either all gases or all liquids, or as 
heterogeneous, in which reactants are in different phases. Under heterogeneous condi-
tions, a reaction is limited by the area of contact of the reactants. Thus, heterogeneous 
reactions that involve solids tend to proceed more rapidly if the surface area of the solid 
is increased. For example, a medicine in the form of a fine powder dissolves in the stom-
ach and enters the blood more quickly than the same medicine in the form of a tablet.
2. Reactant concentrations. Most chemical reactions proceed more quickly if the concen-
tration of one or more reactants is increased. For example, steel wool burns only slowly 
in air, which contains 20% O2, but bursts into flame in pure oxygen (Figure 14.1). As
