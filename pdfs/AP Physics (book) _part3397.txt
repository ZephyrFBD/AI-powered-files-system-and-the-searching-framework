unter just as for a Geiger tube. Solid scintillators are much more dense than
the gas of a Geiger counter, and so are much more efficient detectors—especially
for 
rays, which interact less with matter than do 
or 
particles. Scintillators
that can measure the total energy deposited are much used today and are 
called calorimeters.

In tracer work (Section 31–7), liquid scintillators are often used. Radioactive
samples taken at different times or from different parts of an organism are placed
