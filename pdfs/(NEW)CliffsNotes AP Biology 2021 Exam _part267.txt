nding of two different alleles produces an intermediate phenotype
(incomplete dominance).
Multiple Alleles
In the blood group that produces A, B, and O blood types, there are three possible alleles, represented by IA, IB, or i.
Superscripts are used because the two alleles, A and B, are codominant. A lowercase i is used for the third
allele because it is recessive when expressed with IAor IB. There are six possible genotypes representing all possible
combinations of two alleles: IA
IA and IA i (A blood type), IBIBand IBi (B blood type), IAIB(AB blood type), and ii (O blood type). The four
phenotypes (A, B, AB, and O types) correspond to the presence or absence of an A or B sugar component attached
to proteins of the plasma membrane of red blood cells. Thus, the
IA IAand IA i genotypes have proteins with the A sugar attached, the IB IB
and IBi genotypes have proteins with the B sugar attached, and the IAIB genotype has both kinds of proteins, half
with the A sugar attached and half with
