asked to calculate the number of grams of the solute in the solution.
Plan We can use the definition of molarity (Equation 4.31) to  
determine the number of moles of solute, and then convert  
moles to grams using the molar mass of the solute.
MNa2SO4 = moles Na2SO4
liters soln
Solve Calculating the moles of Na2SO4 using the molarity and  
volume of solution gives
 MNa2SO4 = moles Na2SO4
liters soln
 Moles Na2SO4 = liters soln * MNa2SO4 
 = 10.350 L soln2a
0.500 mol Na2SO4 
1 L soln
b 
 = 0.175 mol Na2SO4
Because each mole of Na2SO4 has a mass of 142.1 g, the required 
number of grams of Na2SO4 is
Grams Na2SO4 = 10.175 mol Na2SO42a
142.1 g Na2SO4
1 mol Na2SO4
b 
 = 24.9 g Na2SO4
Check The magnitude of the answer, the units, and the number of 
significant figures are all appropriate.
