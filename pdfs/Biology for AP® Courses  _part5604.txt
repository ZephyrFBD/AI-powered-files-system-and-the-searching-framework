Germany, ﬁled a petition with the European Medicines Agency in
December, 2020, urging them to stop trials for the Pﬁzer/BioNTech

They were particularly concerned about possible eﬀects on fertility
with ‘vaccine’-produced antibodies aĴacking the protein Syncytin-1
which is responsible for developing the placenta. The result would
