Dinitrophenol (DNP) is an uncoupler that makes the inner mitochondrial membrane leak protons (H+ ) . It was used
until 1938 as a weight-loss drug. Why do you think this might be an effective weight-loss drug?
a.
DNP dissipates the proton gradient in the matrix, preventing the production of ATP. The body then increases
its metabolic rate, leading to weight loss.
b.
DNP decreases the proton gradient in the inner mitochondrial space, leading to rapid consumption of acetyl-
CoA, which causes weight loss.
c.
DNP blocks the movement of protons through the ATP synthase, halting ATP production. The stored energy
dissipates as heat, causing weight loss.
d.
DNP uncouples the production of ATP by increasing the proton gradient in the matrix. The stored energy
dissipates as heat, causing weight loss.
