8 (a) Molecules of a
gas moving about in a rectangular
container. (b) Arrows indicate the
momentum of one molecule as it
rebounds from the end wall.
Taking averages, we obtain
(ii)
Since the velocities of the molecules in our gas are assumed to be random, there
is no preference to one direction or another. Hence
(iii)
Combining Eqs. (iii) and (ii), we get
(iv)
We substitute Eq. (iv) into Eq. (i) for net force F (bottom of previous page):
The pressure on the wall is then
or
(13;6)
where
is the volume of the container. This is the result we wanted, the
pressure exerted by a gas on its container expressed in terms of molecular properties.
Equation 13–6 can be rewritten in a clearer form by multiplying both sides
by V and rearranging the right-hand side:
(13;7)
The quantity 
is the average translational kinetic energy 
of the mole-
cules in the gas. If we compare Eq. 13–7 with Eq. 13–4, the ideal gas law
we see that the two agree if
or
[ideal gas] (13;8)
This equation tells us that
