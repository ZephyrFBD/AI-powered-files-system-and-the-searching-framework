 of crystals. The scientists who led the effort at the University of 
Manchester, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, were awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize 
in Physics for their work.
The properties of graphene are remarkable. It is very strong and has a record thermal 
conductivity, topping carbon nanotubes in both categories. Graphene is a semimetal, 
which means its electronic structure is like that of a semiconductor in which the energy 
gap is exactly zero. The combination of graphene’s two-dimensional character and the 
fact that it is a semimetal allows the electrons to travel very long distances, up to 0.3 μm, 
without scattering from another electron, atom, or impurity. Graphene can sustain elec-
trical current densities six orders of magnitude higher than those sustainable in copper. 
Even though it is only one atom thick, graphene can absorb 2.3% of sunlight that strikes 
it. Scientists are currently exploring ways to incorporate graphene in various technolo-
gies, including el
