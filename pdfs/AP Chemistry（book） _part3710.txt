 a substance to have color we can see, it must absorb some portion of the spec-
trum of visible light. 
 (Section 6.1) Absorption happens, however, only if the energy 
needed to move an electron in the substance from its ground state to an excited state cor-
responds to the energy of some portion of the visible spectrum. 
 (Section 6.3) Thus, 
the particular energies of radiation a substance absorbs dictate the color we see for the 
substance.
Give It Some Thought
Which of the following physical properties of the d and l enantiomers of a substance 
are different: (a) the melting point, (b) the way polarized light is rotated on passing 
through the substance, (c) the color, or (d) all of the above.
