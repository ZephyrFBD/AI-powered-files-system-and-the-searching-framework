during interphase. None of the genetic mutations introduced
during interphase are inherited by the daughter cells.
(B)
The cell replicates its DNA and prepares to divide during
interphase, but does not grow. None of the genetic mutations
introduced during interphase are inherited by the daughter
cells.
(C)
The cell replicates its DNA and prepares to divide during
interphase, but does not grow. If a genetic mutation is
introduced during interphase and not repaired, the daughter
cells will inherit the mutation.
(D)
5. A couple with black hair has three children with black hair and
one child with red hair. How did this most likely occur?
Questions 6–7
The diagram below shows crossing over, a process that happens to
homologous chromosomes during prophase I of meiosis.
A child with red hair is possible through genetic driȇ, in which
two chromosomes exchange genetic information, increasing
the diversity of the individual’s genome.
(A)
Each member of the couple was heterozygous, carrying on
