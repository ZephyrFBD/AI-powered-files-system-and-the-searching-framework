b.
Receptors are specialized cells that detect a
specific stimulus, whereas free nerve endings

c.
Receptors are similar for different stimuli,
whereas free nerve endings are different for
different stimuli.

38. Describe how the steps of sensory perception would be
affected if a person sustains damage to axons that lead
from sensory receptors to the central nervous system.
a.
Reception would not be affected. However,
signal transduction and perception will be
incomplete.
b.
Perception would not be affected. However,
signal transduction and reception will be
incomplete.
c.
Signal transduction would not be affected.
