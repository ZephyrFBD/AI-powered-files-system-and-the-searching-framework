to 5° Celsius would decrease the enzyme’s efficiency.
(d) Decreases in temperature reduce the number of molecular collisions between the substrate and the enzyme,
reducing the number of chemical reactions and the enzyme’s efficiency. Decreases in temperature may also
alter the tertiary structure of the enzyme, altering its active site and reducing its catalytic ability.
12. (a) At 37°C, the rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction for the final 10 minutes of the experiment was 
. At 45°C, the rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction for the final 10
minutes of the experiment was 
.
(b) The optimum temperature for this enzyme is closer to 37°C.
(c) The rate of the reaction is greater at 37°C than at 45°C, so 37°C is closer to the optimum temperature for this
enzyme.
(d) At 50°C, the enzyme was probably denatured. High temperatures can denature enzymes, changing their
shape so that they no longer function.
