ortant piece of 
equipment to include in any classroom 
when studying photosynthesis is a 
PAR meter (photosynthetically active 
radiation). A PAR meter counts photons 
in the PAR spectrum. A PAR meter will 
greatly facilitate experimental design. 
The sample graphs included in this lab 
investigation measured light intensity 
with an outdated measurement, the foot 
candle, which is a subjective measure 
of luminance not closely related to PAR 
flux.

â–  Timing and Length of Lab 
The prelab questions and online preparation and review activities suggested in Getting 
Started can be assigned for homework. 
The first part of the investigation requires one lab period of about 45 minutes to 
introduce the methods of either procedure. The second part, Designing and Conducting 
Your Investigation, requires approximately two lab periods of about 45 minutes each 
for students to conduct their own investigations. If interfaced sensors are available and
