seventh step. I try to tell the angel Mam is 
 
 181 
 
 bleeding to death. I want him to tell me, Fear not, but the step is cold 
 
 and there’s no light, no voice. I’m sure he’s gone forever and I wonder 
 
 if that happens when you go from nine to ten. 
 
 Mam doesn’t bleed to death. She’s out of the bed next day getting 
 
 the baby ready for baptism, telling Bridey she could never forgive herself 
 
 if the baby died and went to Limbo, a place for unbaptized babies, 
 
 where it may be nice and warm but, still, dark forever and no hope of 
 
 escape even on the Judgment Day. 
 
 Grandma is there to help and she says, That’s right, no hope in 
 
 heaven for the infant that’s not baptized. 
 
 Bridey says it would be a hard God that would do the likes of that. 
 
 He has to be hard, says Grandma, otherwise you’d have all kinds of 
 
 babies clamorin’ to get into heaven, Protestants an’ everything, an’ why 
 
 should they get in after what they did to us for eight hundred years?
