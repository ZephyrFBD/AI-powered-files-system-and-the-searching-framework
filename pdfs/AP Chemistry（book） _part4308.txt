rent phase 
from that of the reactant substances. (Section 14.7)
heterogeneous equilibrium The equilibrium established between 
substances in two or more different phases, for example, 
between a gas and a solid or between a solid and a liquid. 
(Section 15.4)
hexagonal close packing A crystal structure where the atoms are 
packed together as closely as possible. The close-packed layers 
adopt a two-layer repeating pattern, which leads to a primitive 
hexagonal unit cell. (Section 12.3)
high-spin complex A complex whose electrons are arranged to 
give the maximum number of unpaired electrons. (Section 23.6)
hole A vacancy in the valence band of a semiconductor, created 
by doping. (Section 12.7)
homogeneous catalyst A catalyst that is in the same phase as the 
reactant substances. (Section 14.7)
homogeneous equilibrium The equilibrium established between 
reactant and product substances that are all in the same phase.

Hund’s rule A rule stating that electrons occupy deg
