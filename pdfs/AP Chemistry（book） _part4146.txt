germanium (c) silicon 22.73 (a) Tetrahedral (b) Metasilicic acid will 
probably adopt the single-strand silicate chain structure shown in 
Figure 22.32 (b). The Si to O ratio is correct and there are two termi-
nal O atoms per Si that can accommodate the two H atoms associ-
ated with each Si atom of the acid. 22.75 (a) Two Ca2 +  (b) two OH- 
22.77 (a) Diborane has bridging H atoms linking the two B atoms. 
The structure of ethane has the C atoms bound directly, with no 
bridging atoms. (b) B2H6 is an electron-deﬁcient molecule. The 6 
valence electron pairs are all involved in B¬H sigma bonding, so 
the only way to satisfy the octet rule at B is to have the bridging H 
atoms shown in Figure 22.35. (c) The term hydridic indicates that 
the H atoms in B2H6 have more than the usual amount of electron 
density for a covalently bound H atom. 22.79 (a) False (b) true
