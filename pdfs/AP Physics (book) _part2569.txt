Diverging Lens
By drawing the same three rays emerging from a single object point, we can deter-
mine the image position formed by a diverging lens, as shown in Fig. 23–39. Note
that ray 1 is drawn parallel to the axis, but does not pass through the focal point 
behind the lens. Instead it seems to come (dashed line) from the focal point F in front
of the lens. Ray 2 is directed toward 
and is refracted parallel to the lens axis 
by the lens. Ray 3 passes directly through the center of the lens. The three refracted
rays seem to emerge from a point on the left of the lens. This is the image point, I.
Because the rays do not pass through the image, it is a virtual image. Note that the
eye does not distinguish between real and virtual images—both are visible.

23–8 The Thin Lens Equation
We now derive an equation that relates the image distance to the object distance
