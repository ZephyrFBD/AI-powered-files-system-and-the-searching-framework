melts, (b) a gas liquefies, (c) a 
solid sublimes?
 19.36  Does the entropy of the system increase, decrease, or stay 
the same when (a) the temperature of the system increases, 
(b) the volume of a gas increases, (c) equal volumes of etha-
nol and water are mixed to form a solution?
 19.37  Indicate whether each statement is true or false. (a) The 
third law of thermodynamics says that the entropy of a 
perfect, pure crystal at absolute zero increases with the 
mass of the crystal. (b) “Translational motion” of mole-
cules refers to their change in spatial location as a func-
tion of time. (c) “Rotational” and “vibrational” motions 
contribute to the entropy in atomic gases like He and Xe. 
 
(d) The larger the number of atoms in a molecule, the 
more degrees of freedom of rotational and vibrational 
motion it likely has.
 19.38  Indicate whether each statement is true or false. (a) Unlike 
enthalpy, where we can only ever know changes in H, we 
can know absolute values of S. (b) If y
