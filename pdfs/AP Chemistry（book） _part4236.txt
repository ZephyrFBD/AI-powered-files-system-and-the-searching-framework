es as the anode of the 
cell. Figure 20.5 The electrical balance is maintained in two ways: 
Anions migrate into the half-cell, and cations migrate out via the salt 
bridge. Figure 20.9 As the cell operates, H+ is reduced to H2 in the 
cathode half-cell. As H+ is depleted, the positive Na+ ions are drawn 
into the half-cell to maintain electrical balance in the solution.  
Figure 20.11 Yes. Figure 20.13 The variable n is the number 
of moles of electrons transferred in the process. Figure 20.14  
The cathode. Figure 20.19 The cathode consists of PbO21s2. 
Because each oxygen has an oxidation state of -2, lead must have 
an oxidation state of +4 in this compound. Figure 20.20 Zn
