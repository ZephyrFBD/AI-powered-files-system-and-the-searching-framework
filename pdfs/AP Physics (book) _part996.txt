28. (III) You are on a pirate ship and being forced to walk the
plank (Fig. 9–68). You are standing at the point marked C.
The plank is nailed onto the deck at point A, and rests on
the support 0.75 m away from A. The center of mass of the
uniform plank is located at point B. Your mass is 65 kg and
the mass of the plank is 45 kg. What is the minimum down-
ward force the nails must exert on the plank to hold it in
place?

34. (II) (a) Calculate the magnitude of the force,
required of
the “deltoid”muscle to hold up the outstretched arm shown in
Fig. 9–72. The total mass of the arm is 3.3 kg. (b) Calculate
the magnitude of the force 
exerted by the shoulder joint on
