i-square analysis of the results to determine if the distribution of the 
flies is significant. 
4. Released AP Exams have several multiple-choice and free-response (essay) questions 
based on the concepts studied in this investigation. One good example is the free-

■ Where Can Students Go from Here? 
One possible extension for this investigation is to ask students to identify another 
organism that behaves similarly to the fruit fly and one that they expect would behave 
differently. For example, students could substitute ladybugs, houseflies, or mealworms 
for fruit flies and construct choice chambers using other substances that they think 
might be attractive to these organisms.
