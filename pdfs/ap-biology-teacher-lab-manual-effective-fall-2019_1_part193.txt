flower. 
Step 3 When the plants are about 7 to 12 days old (Figure 7), the class needs to choose 1–2 
variable traits for artificial selection. Several variable traits can work for this. Compare 
your observations with those of other students. You want a trait that varies between 
plants in a single bottle but also varies between containers. The trait should not be 
something that is Yes or No, but rather something that varies within a range. That is, 
look for traits that you can score on a continuum (length, width, number, and so on). 
If you and your classmates cannot identify a trait on your own, your teacher will provide 
additional guidance.

Step 4 Score each of your plants for the trait that your class chose to evaluate. You may 
need a magnifier to do this accurately. Don’t be surprised if some plants are not very 
different from one another. 
Step 5 In your lab notebook, compile a list of al
