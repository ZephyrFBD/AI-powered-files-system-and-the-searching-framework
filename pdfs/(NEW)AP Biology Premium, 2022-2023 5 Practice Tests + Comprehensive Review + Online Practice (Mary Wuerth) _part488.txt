 dominant allele, not the homozygous dominant genotype. The frequency of the dominant phenotype is 79%,
so choice (D) is also incorrect.
9. (B) If 19% of the individuals have the recessive genetic disease, q2 = 0.19 and q = 0.436. Then since p + q = 1,
p = 0.564. The heterozygous individuals are resistant to the parasites and have a frequency of 2pq = 2 × 0.564 ×
0.436 = 0.492. Choice (A) is the frequency of the recessive allele and is incorrect. Choice (C) is the frequency
of the dominant allele and is incorrect. The frequency of individuals who do not have the recessive disease
(some of whom may be heterozygous and others who may be homozygous dominant) is 81%, so choice (D) is
incorrect.
10. (A) If the parasite was totally eliminated from this environment, there would no longer be any advantage to
being heterozygous for the recessive allele. So over time, natural selection would increase the frequencies of the
AA and aa genotypes and the frequency of the Aa genotype would decrease.
