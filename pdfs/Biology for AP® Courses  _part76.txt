for the variables and controls in
the examples that follow. To test the first hypothesis, the student would find out if the air conditioning is on. If the air
conditioning is turned on but does not work, there should be another reason, and this hypothesis should be rejected. To test
the second hypothesis, the student could check if the lights in the classroom are functional. If so, there is no power failure
and this hypothesis should be rejected. Each hypothesis should be tested by carrying out appropriate experiments. Be aware
that rejecting one hypothesis does not determine whether or not the other hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates
one hypothesis that is not valid (see this figure). Using the scientific method, the hypotheses that are inconsistent with
experimental data are rejected.
While this “warm classroom” example is based on observational results, other hypotheses and experiments might have
clearer controls. For instance, a student might attend class on Monday an
