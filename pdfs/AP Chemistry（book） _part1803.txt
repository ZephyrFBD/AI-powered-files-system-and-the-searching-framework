 boiling points in each pair: 
(a) HF 120 °C2 and HCl 1
-85 °C2, (b) CHCl3 161 °C2 and 
CHBr3 1150 °C2, (c) Br2 159 °C2 and ICl 197 °C2.
 11.27  Ethylene glycol 1HOCH2CH2OH2, the major substance in 
 
antifreeze, has a normal boiling point of 198 °C. By 
comparison, ethyl alcohol 1CH3CH2OH2 boils at 78 °C 
at atmospheric pressure. Ethylene glycol dimethyl ether 
1CH3OCH2CH2OCH32 has a normal boiling point of 83 °C, 
 
where R is a ¬ CH21CH22nCH3 alkyl group. The melt-
ing points of the salts that form between the 1-alkyl- 
3-methylimidazolium cation and the PF6
- anion are 
 
as follows: R = CH2CH3 1m.p. = 60 °C2, R = CH2CH2CH3
1m.p. = 40 °C2, R = CH2CH2CH2CH3 1m.p. = 10 °C2, and 
R = CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 1m.p. = -61 °C2. Why does 
the melting point decrease as the length of alkyl group 
increases?
