10. The lactose (lac) operon of E. coli is under dual control from a
repressor protein that binds to the operator in the absence of
available lactose and the catabolite activator protein (CAP). The
repressor prevents transcription of a polycistronic (single) mRNA
containing the coding information for structural genes lacZ, lacY,
and lacA. CAP binds to a sequence upstream of the promoter
when glucose levels are low. Binding of CAP is required for the
transcription of the structural genes.
In an experiment, E. coli cells are grown on a medium
supplemented with lactose as the only source of carbon. A
scientist measures transcription of the structural genes associated
with the lac operon. How many distinct strands of mRNA are
transcribed from the lac operon under the described
experimental condi
