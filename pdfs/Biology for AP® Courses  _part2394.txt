CHAPTER SUMMARY
21.1 Viral Evolution, Morphology, and Classification
Viruses are tiny, acellular entities that can usually only be seen with an electron microscope. Their genomes contain either
DNA or RNA—never both—and they replicate using the replication proteins of a host cell. Viruses are diverse, infecting
