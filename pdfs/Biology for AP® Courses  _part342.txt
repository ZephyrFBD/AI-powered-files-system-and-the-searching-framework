is synthesized in the nucleus. The RNA base sequence is complementary to the coding sequence of the DNA from which
it has been copied. However, in RNA, the base T is absent and U is present instead. If the DNA strand has a sequence
AATTGCGC, the sequence of the complementary RNA is UUAACGCG. In the cytoplasm, the mRNA interacts with
ribosomes and other cellular machinery (Figure 3.36).

Figure 3.36 A ribosome has two parts: a large subunit and a small subunit. The mRNA sits in between the two
subunits. A tRNA molecule recognizes a codon on the mRNA, binds to it by complementary base pairing, and adds
the correct amino acid to the growing peptide chain.
The mRNA is read in sets of three bases known as codons. Each codon codes for a single amino acid. In this way, the
mRNA is read and the protein product is made. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a major constituent of ribosomes on which
the mRNA binds. The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the m
