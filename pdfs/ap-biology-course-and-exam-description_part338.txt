Figure 2. Susceptibility of A. gambiae mosquitoes from two regions to the pyrethroids deltamethrin 
and permethrin. A mosquito strain that is susceptible to the insecticides displayed at least 95% 
mortality in all experiments, and mosquitoes exposed to untreated filter paper displayed less than 
10% mortality. Error bars represent standard deviation. “ND” means no data are available.
