sci (spores from both
strains).
2. Under the microscope, count the number of hybrid asci that contain ascospores with crossovers and the number of
asci that contain ascospores without crossovers.
3. To determine crossover frequency, first divide the number of asci with crossovers by the total hybrid asci
observed (asci with and without crossovers); then divide this number by 2 and convert to a percent by multiplying
by 100.
Investigation 8: Bacterial Transformation
Transformation is the uptake of external DNA by cells. In this investigation you will direct transformation by
facilitating the transfer of a bacterial plasmid into E. coli bacteria.
Plasmids are common vectors (or carriers) for transferring DNA into bacteria. This investigation uses the plasmid
pAMP, a plasmid that contains a gene that provides resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin. As a result, bacteria that
have successfully absorbed the plasmid possess resistance to the antibiotic and can be separated from other bacter
