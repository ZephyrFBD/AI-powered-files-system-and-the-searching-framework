the cycle with the 24 hours in a day.
Day/night rhythms are displayed by all animals in one form or another. Diurnal animals are active during the day
and sleep at night. Nocturnal animals, like owls, bats, and moths, are active at night and rest or sleep during the day.
The kangaroo rat, a desert rodent, is only active in the early evening hours, when the temperatures are cooler and
when risk from predators is at a minimum. Once fully dark, night predators such as owls pose a high risk to the
survival of the kangaroo rat.
In humans, the biological clock is maintained by melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland. The pineal
gland is located in the brain, associated with the forebrain. The gland has neural connections with the eye which it
uses to obtain external stimuli (changes in light intensities). The “jet lag” that we experience when we move
between time zones is the result of the lag in the response of the pineal gland to reset the biological clock with
external stimuli.
