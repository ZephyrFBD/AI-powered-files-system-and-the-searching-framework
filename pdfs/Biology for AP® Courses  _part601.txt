Objective
2.30 The student can create representations or models to describe nonspecific immune
defenses in plants and animals.
In addition to moving small ions and molecules through the membrane, cells also need to remove and take in larger
molecules and particles (see Table 5.2 for examples). Some cells are even capable of engulfing entire unicellular
microorganisms. You might have correctly hypothesized that the uptake and release of large particles by the cell requires
energy. A large particle, however, cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy supplied by the cell.
Endocytosis
Endocytosis is a type of active transport that moves particles, such as large molecules, parts of cells, and even whole cells,
into a cell. There are different variations of endocytosis, but all share a common characteristic: The plasma membrane of the
cell invaginates, forming a pocket around the target particle. The pocket pinches off, resulting i
