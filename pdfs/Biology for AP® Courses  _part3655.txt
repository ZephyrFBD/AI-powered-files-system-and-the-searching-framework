29. How does the administration of 100 percent oxygen
save a patient from carbon monoxide poisoning? Why
wouldnâ€™t giving carbon dioxide work?
a.
At that concentration, oxygen will be transported
in the body at a high rate by dissolving in blood.
Oxygen has more affinity for hemoglobin than
carbon dioxide.
b.
At that concentration, oxygen will displace the
carbon monoxide from the hemoglobin. Oxygen
has more affinity for hemoglobin than carbon
dioxide.
c.
At that concentration, oxygen will displace the
carbon monoxide from the hemoglobin. Carbon
dioxide has more affinity for hemoglobin than
oxygen.
d.
