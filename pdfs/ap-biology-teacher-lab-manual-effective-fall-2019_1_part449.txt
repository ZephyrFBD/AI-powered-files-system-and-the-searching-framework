 for each group, and calculate the mean and standard deviation 
for each group. 
5. Compare the number of cells from each group in interphase and in mitosis. 
6. Use a chi-square distribution test to statistically analyze the data. 
â–  Alternative Procedure 
You can mask root tips on prepared slides with masking tape and have the students 
count cells. Students can compare cells close to the end of the root tip to those farther 
from the end.

1. Collect the class data and enter the values into Table 1; these are the observed values 
for the four groups. 
2. Use the data from Table 1 to calculate the totals using the formulas found in Table 2.
