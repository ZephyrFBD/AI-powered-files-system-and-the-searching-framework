diﬀerent alleles (e.g., Bb), it
is called heterozygous for the gene.
Because the green eye color allele is recessive, it can be discerned that an
individual in the population with green eyes has the genotype bb. An
individual with blue eyes can have either a BB genotype or a Bb
genotype. The genotype of a blue-eyed individual can be determined by
mating the blue-eyed individual with a green-eyed individual. This is
called a test cross. If all of the oﬀspring have blue eyes, then the blue-
eyed individual was homozygous dominant. The genotypes of all of the
oﬀspring from a mating between a BB genotype and a bb genotype can
only be Bb.
If any of the oﬀspring have green eyes, the blue-eyed adult must have
been heterozygous. The genotypes of the oﬀspring from a mating
between a Bb genotype and a bb genotype are either Bb or bb. Mating
between two heterozygous adults can produce oﬀspring with three
diﬀerent genotypes: BB, Bb, and bb. In this case, two blue-eyed adults
can produce a green-ey
