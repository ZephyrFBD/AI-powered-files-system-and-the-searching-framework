to N2.
 
From the NH4+or NO3âˆ’absorbed, plants make amino acids and nucleic
 
acids. When animals eat the plants (or other animals), they, in turn, obtain a form of nitrogen that they can
metabolize. When animals break down
 
proteins, they produce ammonia (NH3). Since NH3is toxic, many animals, such as aquatic animals, excrete it
directly. Other animals convert NH3to
less toxic forms, such as urea (mammals) or uric acid (insects and birds). When plants and animals die, they
decompose through the process of ammonification, in which bacteria convert the amino acids and other
nitrogen-containing compounds to NH4+, which then becomes available
 
again for plants.
The AP exam may ask you to discuss any of the biogeochemical cycles. The nitrogen cycle is the most common
request. You may want to supplement your discussion with a drawing using arrows to show the various conversions
of nitrogen. If you do make a drawing, however, you must still provide a complete discussion.
