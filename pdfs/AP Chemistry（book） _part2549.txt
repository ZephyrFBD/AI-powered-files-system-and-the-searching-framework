, the concentration of OH -1aq2 
for the solution in part (b) is 2 * 10.0011 M2 = 0.0022 M.
Method 1:
3H+4 = 1.0 * 10-14
0.0022
= 4.55 * 10-12 M
 
   pH = -log14.55 * 10-122 = 11.34
Method 2:
pOH = -log10.00222 = 2.66
pH = 14.00 - pOH = 11.34
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Order the following three solutions from smallest to largest pH:
(i) 0.030 M Ba1OH22  (ii) 0.040 M KOH  (iii) pure water.
(a) i 6 ii 6 iii (b) ii 6 i 6 iii (c) iii 6 i 6 ii
(d) ii 6 iii 6 i (e) iii 6 ii 6 i
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
What is the concentration of a solution of (a) KOH for which 
the pH is 11.89, (b) Ca1OH22 for which the pH is 11.68?

CHAPTER 16 Acid–Base Equilibria
Although all of the alkali metal hydroxides are strong electrolytes, LiOH, RbOH, 
and CsOH are not commonly encountered in the laboratory. The hydroxides of the 
heavier alkaline earth metals¬Ca1OH22, Sr1OH22, and Ba1OH22:are also strong elec-
trolytes. They have limited solubility, however, so they are used only when high solubil-
ity is not crit
