sequence containing multiple sites
that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases. Restriction endonucleases recognize specific
DNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism
against foreign DNA. Many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA, such that the cut
ends have a 2- or 4-base single-stranded overhang. Because these overhangs are capable of annealing with complementary
overhangs, these are called “sticky ends.” Addition of an enzyme called DNA ligase permanently joins the DNA fragments
via phosphodiester bonds. In this way, any DNA fragment generated by restriction endonuclease cleavage can be spliced
between the two ends of a plasmid DNA that has been cut with the same restriction endonuclease (Figure 17.6).
Recombinant DNA Molecules
Plasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called recombinant DNA molecules because they are created artificially
