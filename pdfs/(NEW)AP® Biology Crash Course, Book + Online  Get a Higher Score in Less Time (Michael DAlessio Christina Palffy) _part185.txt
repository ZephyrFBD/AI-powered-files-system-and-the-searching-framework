ort-tailed mice, 14 – 25 = –11. –11 squared is
121. 121 divided by 25 is 4.84. Add 1.62 and 4.84.
4. (C) is correct. The null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the observed and the
expected values. If the p-value is below 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected. If the p-value is above
0.05, then the null hypothesis is not rejected. Another way to analyze the p-value is based on the
critical value. The critical value is the chi-square value equivalent to 0.05. If the chi-square is above
the critical value, the null is rejected. The following chart will be given to you on the exam. It shows
the critical values for p-values of 0.05 and 0.10. Since the chi-square is above the critical value of
0.05, the null is rejected. When reading the chart, it is important to use the correct degrees of freedom.
This is 1 subtracted from the number of categories, so in this case it is 1.
