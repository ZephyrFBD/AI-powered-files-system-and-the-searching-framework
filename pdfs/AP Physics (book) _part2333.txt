EXERCISE D A bicycle headlight is powered by a generator that is turned by the bicycle
wheel. (a) If you speed up, how does the power to the light change? (b) Does the gener-
ator resist being turned as the bicycle’s speed increases, and if so how?
Eddy Currents
Induced currents are not always confined to well-defined paths such as in wires.
Consider, for example, the rotating metal wheel in Fig. 21–20a. An external mag-
netic field is applied to a limited area of the wheel as shown and points into the
page. The section of wheel in the magnetic field has an emf induced in it because the
conductor is moving, carrying electrons with it. The flow of induced (conventional)
current in the wheel is upward in the region of the magnetic field (Fig. 21–20b),
and the current follows a downward return path outside that region. Why?
According to Lenz’s law, the induced currents oppose the change that causes them.
