If K V 1 (small K): Equilibrium lies to left, reactants predominate
These situations are summarized in Figure 15.7. Remember, it is forward and reverse 
reaction rates, not reactant and product concentrations, that are equal at equilibrium.

The direction of the Chemical Equation and K
We have seen that we can represent the N2O4>NO2 equilibrium as
 
N2O41g2 ∆ 2 NO21g2 Kc =
3NO242
3N2O44 = 0.212 1at 100 °C2 
[15.17]
We could equally well consider this equilibrium in terms of the reverse reaction:
 
2 NO21g2 ∆ N2O41g2 
The equilibrium expression is then
 
Kc =
3N2O44
3NO242 =
1
0.212 = 4.72 1at 100 °C2 
[15.18]
Equation 15.18 is the r
