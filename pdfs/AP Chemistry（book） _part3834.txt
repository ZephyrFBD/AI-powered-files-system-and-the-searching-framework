ssures. One reason for the lack of reactivity of H2 toward 
alkenes is the stability of the H2 bond. To promote the reaction, the reaction temperature 
must be raised 1500 °C2, and a catalyst (such as Ni) is used to assist in rupturing the H¬H 
bond. We write such conditions over the reaction arrow to indicate they must be present 
in order for the reaction to occur. The most widely used catalysts are finely divided metals 
on which H2 is adsorbed. 
 (Section 14.7)
Hydrogen halides and water can also add to the double bond of alkenes, as in these 
reactions of ethylene:
 
CH2 “CH2 + HBr ¡ CH3CH2Br 
[24.3]
 
 CH2 “CH2 + H2O ¡
H2SO4  CH3CH2OH 
[24.4]
The addition of water is catalyzed by a strong acid, such as H2SO4.
The addition reactions of alkynes resemble those of alkenes, as shown in these
