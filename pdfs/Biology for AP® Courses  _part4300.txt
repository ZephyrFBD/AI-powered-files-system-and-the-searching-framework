a.
They are subject to constant exposure to air,
sunlight, periods of dryness, and pounding
waves. For this reason, some species have an
exoskeleton.
b.
They are subject to periodic exposures to air,
sunlight, periods of dryness, and pounding
waves. For this reason, some species have an
exoskeleton.
c.
They are subject to periodic exposures to air,
sunlight, periods of dryness, and pounding
waves. For this reason, all species have an
exoskeleton.
d.
They are subject to periodic exposures to air,
sunlight, periods of dryness, and pounding
waves. For this reason, most species have an
endoskeleton.
