 increasing levels of carbon dioxide on the coral reefs? How does it
affect the local ecosystem?
a.
Due to rising temperature, coral reefs lose their symbiotic partner, the algae, in the process called bleaching.
Rising CO2 changes the pH of water, which interferes with calcification. Animals whose source of food is
coral reefs also decline in numbers.
b.
Due to rising temperature the hard calcium carbonate skeleton of coral reefs is destroyed due to a process
called bleaching. Rising CO2 changes pH of water which interferes with calcification. Animals whose source
of food is coral reefs also decline in numbers.
c.
Due to rising temperature, coral reefs lose their symbiotic partner, the algae, in the process called ocean
acidification. Rising CO2 changes the pH of water, which interferes with calcification. Animals whose source
of food is coral reefs also decline in numbers.
d.
Due to rising temperature, coral reefs lose their symbiotic partner, the algae. Rising CO2 changes the pH
