e and explain biological concepts, processes, or models.
Part B (3–4 points): Identify experimental design procedures.
Part C (1–3 points): Analyze data.
Part D (2–4 points): Make and justify predictions.
Question 2: Interpreting and Evaluating Experimental Results with Graphing
This question is similar to question 1, except the student will be required to construct a data representation.
Part A (1–2 points): Describe and explain biological concepts, processes, or models.
Part B (4 points): Construct a graph, plot, or chart and use confidence intervals or error bars.
Part C (1–3 points): Analyze data.
Part D (1–3 points): Make and justify predictions.
Questions 3–6 are short questions that are each worth 4 points.
Question 3: Scientific Investigation
Students will be provided with a lab investigation scenario.
Part A (1 point): Describe biological concepts or processes.
Part B (1 point): Identify experimental procedures.
Part C (1 point): Predict results.
Part D (1 point): Justify pred
