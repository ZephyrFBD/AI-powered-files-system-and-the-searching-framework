ule will be polar (that is, it will 
have a nonzero dipole moment).
COVALENT BONDING AND VALENCE-BOND THEORY (SEC-
TION 9.4) Valence-bond theory is an extension of Lewisâ€™s notion of 
electron-pair bonds. In valence-bond theory, covalent bonds are 
formed when atomic orbitals on neighboring atoms overlap one an-
other. The overlap region is one of greater stability for the two electrons 
because of their simultaneous attraction to two nuclei. The greater the 
overlap between two orbitals, the stronger the bond that is formed.
HYBRID ORBITALS (SECTION 9.5) To extend the ideas of valence- 
bond theory to polyatomic molecules, we must envision mix-
ing s and p orbitals to form hybrid orbitals. The process of 
 
hybridization leads to hybrid atomic orbitals that have a large lobe di-
rected to overlap with orbitals on another atom to make a bond. Hy-
brid orbitals can also accommodate nonbonding pairs. A particular 
mode of hybridization can be associated with each of three com-
mon electro
