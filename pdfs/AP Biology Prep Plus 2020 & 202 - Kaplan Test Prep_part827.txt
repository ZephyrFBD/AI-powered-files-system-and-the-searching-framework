rsity includes the genetic diversity
of the species, as well as the various ways species interact with each
other and their environment. All species in an ecosystem depend on one
another. As seen in chapter 16, the level of variation in a population
aﬀects population dynamics (size and age). Similarly, the diversity within
an ecosystem may influence the stability of the ecosystem. Providing
19.5 Explain how diversity aﬀects stability
robustness to the ecosystem, diversity increases the ability of ecosystems
to tolerate and respond to changes in the environment, as well as
prevents widespread diseases. Keystone species, producers, and abiotic
and biotic factors all contribute to maintaining the diversity of an
ecosystem. Human activities, however, have strained the diversity of
ecosystems and could eventually lead to another mass extinction.
Keystone species are species that help to increase the diversity of an
ecosystem. Many species are dependent upon keystone species. Thus,
