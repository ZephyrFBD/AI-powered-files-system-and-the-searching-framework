the time it takes
the ball to rise to its highest point and then fall to the base of the cliff. To rise
and fall back to the top of the cliff took 3.06 s (Example 2–13); so it took 
an additional 2.01 s to fall to the base. But what is the meaning of the other
solution,
This is a time before the throw, when our calculation
begins, so it isn’t relevant here. It is outside our chosen time interval, and so is
an unphysical solution (also in Example 2–8).
(b) From Example 2–12, the ball moves up 11.5 m, falls 11.5 m back down to
the top of the cliff, and then down another 50.0 m to the base of the cliff, for a
total distance traveled of 73.0 m. [Note that the displacement, however, was
