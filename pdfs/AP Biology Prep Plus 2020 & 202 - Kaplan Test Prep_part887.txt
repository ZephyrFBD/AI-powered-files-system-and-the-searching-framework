eed
The four sources of ATP are free ATP, phosphocreatine, anaerobic respiration, and aerobic
respiration; free ATP is used first, then ATP from phosphocreatine, and then ATP from anaerobic
and aerobic respiration.  
amount of free ATP is available for muscles to use immediately. After exhausting
the free ATP, muscles obtain ATP from phosphocreatine, which can rapidly
provide ATP for a few seconds. Then, anaerobic respiration (glycolysis) can
provide ATP for about a minute, and aerobic respiration can generate ATP
needed for long periods of exercise.
(b) Using the template, graph the predicted shape of the aerobic respiration
energy curve as oxygen becomes limited aȇer a few hours of exercise. (1

Here is a sample graph that would earn full credit:
The aerobic respiration energy curve will decrease as oxygen becomes limited
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
When oxygen levels decrease, pyruvate in the Krebs cycle becomes i
