Microbiologists are scientists who study microbes. Microbiologists can pursue a number of careers. Not only
do they work in the food industry, they are also employed in the veterinary and medical fields. They can work
in the pharmaceutical sector, serving key roles in research and development by identifying new sources of
antibiotics that could be used to treat bacterial infections.
Environmental microbiologists may look for new ways to use specially selected or genetically engineered
microbes for the remo
