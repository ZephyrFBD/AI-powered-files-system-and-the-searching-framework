en that the electric field 
between two close parallel plates is
nearly uniform and its magnitude is related to the potential difference by
(Eq. 17–4), where d is the separation. Also, Eq. 17–8 tells us
for a parallel-plate capacitor. Thus
The quantity Ad is the volume between the plates in which the electric field E
exists. If we divide both sides of this equation by the volume, we obtain an
expression for the energy per unit volume or energy density:
(17;11)
The electric energy stored per unit volume in any region of space is proportional to
the square of the electric field in that region. We derived Eq. 17–11 for the special
case of a parallel-plate capacitor. But it can be shown to be true for any region of
space where there is an electric field. Indeed, we will use this result when we dis-
cuss electromagnetic radiation (Chapter 22).
