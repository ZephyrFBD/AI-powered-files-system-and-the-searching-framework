Structure and Function of the Cell
The cell is the basic functional unit of all living things. The plasma membrane (cell membrane) bounds the cell
and encloses the nucleus and cytoplasm. The cytoplasm consists of specialized bodies called organelles suspended
in a fluid matrix, the cytosol, which consists of water and dissolved substances such as proteins and nutrients.
The plasma membrane separates internal metabolic events from the external environment and controls the
movement of materials into and out of the cell. The plasma membrane is a double phospholipid membrane
(phospholipid bilayer) with the polar hydrophilic heads forming the two outer faces and the nonpolar hydrophobic
tails pointing toward the inside of the membrane (Figure 3-1).

Proteins are scattered throughout the flexible phospholipid membrane. Proteins may attach loosely to the inner or
outer surface of the membrane, or they may extend into the membrane. Similar to how ph
