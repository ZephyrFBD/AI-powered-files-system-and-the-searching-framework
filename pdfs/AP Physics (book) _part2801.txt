built around 1590. Kepler (see Chapter 5) gave a ray description (in 1611) of the Keplerian telescope,
which is named for him because he first described it, although he did not build it.

Several types of astronomical telescope exist. The common refracting type,
sometimes called Keplerian, contains two converging lenses located at opposite
ends of a long tube, as illustrated in Fig. 25–20. The lens closest to the object is
called th
