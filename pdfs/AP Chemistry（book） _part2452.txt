he total pressure in the vessel at equilibrium? (d) At 25 °C the value 
of Kp for this reaction is 1.7 * 10-21. Is the reaction exothermic or endothermic? (e) To produce the maximum amount of CO 
and H2 at equilibrium, should the pressure of the system be increased or decreased?
We then construct a table of initial partial 
pressures and their changes as equilibrium is 
achieved:
(a) To determine the equilibrium partial pressures, 
we use the ideal-gas equation, first determin-
ing the starting partial pressure of water.
