ls on Australia, South America,
and Antarctica became isolated from other mammals when these continents separated. These mammals evolved into
the marsupial mammals, while mammals on the remaining land masses evolved into the placental mammals.
Biogeochemical Cycles
Biogeochemical cycles describe the flow of essential elements from the environment to living things and back to the
environment. The following list outlines the major storage locations (reservoirs) for essential elements, the processes
through which each element incorporates into terrestrial plants and animals (assimilation), and the processes through
which each element returns to the environment (release).
1. Hydrologic cycle (water cycle).
Reservoirs: Oceans, air (as water vapor), groundwater, glaciers. (Evaporation, wind, and precipitation move water
from oceans to land.)
Assimilation: Plants absorb water from the soil; animals drink water or eat other organisms (which are mostly
water).
Release: Plants transpire; animals
