Phylogenetic trees can represent traits that are derived or lost due to evolution. One example is the absence of legs in
some marine mammals. One such group is the Cetaceans, which includes toothed whales, such as dolphins and killer
whales, and baleen whales, such as humpback whales. Cetaceans are descended from even-toed ungulates and share a
common ancestry with the hippopotamus, cows, sheep, camel, and pig. Based on this phylogenetic tree, which of the
following animal is the most closely related to a horse?
a.
an armadillo
b.
a camel
c.
a bat
d.
a cat
Branches of Biological Study
The scope of biology is broad and therefore contains many branches and subdisciplines. Biologists may pursue one of
those subdisciplines and work in a more focused field. For instance, molecular biology and biochemistry study b
