ter negative charge 
than BF4
-, so ion–ion electrostatic attractions are greater in sulfate 
salts and they are less likely to form liquids. 11.33 (a) As temperature 
increases, surface tension decreases; they are inversely related. (b) As 
temperature increases, viscosity decreases; they are inversely related. 
(c) The same attractive forces that cause surface molecules to be dif-
ﬁcult to separate (high surface tension) cause molecules elsewhere 
in the sample to resist movement relative to each other (high viscos-
ity).  11.35 (a) Diagram (ii) shows stronger adhesive forces between 
the surface and the liquid. (b) Diagram (i) represents water on a non-
polar surface. (c) Diagram (ii) represents water on a polar surface. 
 
11.37 (a) The three molecules have similar structures and experience 
the same types of intermolecular forces. As molar mass increases, the 
strength of dispersion forces increases and the boiling points, sur-
face tension, and viscosities all increase. (b) Ethyl
