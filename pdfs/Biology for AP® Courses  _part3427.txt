t soluble
and therefore able to pass through the cell
membrane to reach intracellular receptors.
c.
A polypeptide-derived hormone because it is fat
soluble and therefore able to pass through the
cell membrane to reach intracellular receptors.
d.
A polypeptide-derived hormone because it is fat
insoluble and therefore binds to receptors on the
outer surface of the plasma membrane.
59. In this figure, what kind of hormone is bound to the
target cell receptor?
a.
steroid
b.
lipid-derived
c.
estradiol
d.
amino acid-derived
60. Blood pressure and blood volume are increased by the
production of the hormones antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
and aldosterone. Describe how renin promotes release of
ADH and aldosterone.
a.
Renin cleaves angiotensinogen.
b.
Renin directly simulates ADH and aldosterone
production.
c.
Renin produces angiotensin II.
d.
Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II.
61. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is essential for water
regulation in the kidneys. Once released from the pituita
