entical?
Could they ever be?
a.
No, they cannot be identical because the T
nucleotide in DNA is replaced with U nucleotide
in RNA and AUG is the start codon.
b.
No, they cannot be identical because the T
nucleotide in RNA is replaced with U nucleotide
in DNA.
c.
They can be identical if methylation of the U
nucleotide in RNA occurs and gives T
nucleotide.
d.
They can be identical if de-methylation of the U
nucleotide in RNA occurs and gives T
nucleotide.
28. Imagine if there were 200 commonly occurring amino
acids instead of 20. Given what you know about the

length? Explain.
a.

29. What part of central dogma is not always followed in
viruses?
a.
The flow of information in HIV is from RNA to
DNA, then back to RNA to proteins. Influenza
viruses never go through DNA.
b.
The flow of information is from protein to RNA
in HIV virus, while the influenza virus converts
DNA to RNA.
c.
The flow of information is
