The product of this reaction, C2H4, contains 
a C—C double bond, with a typical bond length of 1.34 Å. 8.77 A 
triple C—C bond 8.85 (a) B¬O. The most polar bond will be formed 
by the two elements with the greatest difference in electronegativity.  
(b) Te¬ I. These elements have the two largest covalent radii among 
this group. (c) TeI2. The octet rule is satisﬁed for all three atoms.  
(d) P2O3. Each P atom needs to share 3 e- and each O atom 2 e- to 
achieve an octet. And B2O3. Although this is not a purely ionic com-
pound, it can be understood in terms of gaining and losing electrons 
to achieve a noble-gas conﬁguration. If each B atom were to lose 3 e- 
and each O atom were to gain 2 e-, charge balance and the octet rule 
would be satisﬁed. 8.90 (a) +1 (b) -1 (c) +1 (assuming the odd elec-
tron is on N) (d) 0 (e) +3 8.95 (a) False. The B¬ A “B structure says 
nothing about the nonbonding electrons in the molecule. (b) True 
8.98 (a) Ti2 +, 3Ar43d2; Ca, 3Ar44s2. (b) Ca has no unpa
