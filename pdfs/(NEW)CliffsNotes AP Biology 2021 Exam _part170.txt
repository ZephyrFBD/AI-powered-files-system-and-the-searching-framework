Answers and Explanations
Multiple-Choice Questions
1. C. All of the light-absorbing pigments and most of the enzymes for the light reactions are found in the thylakoid
membranes. There are several kinds of chlorophyll, including chlorophyll a and b (and c and d in
certain algae). P700 and P680 are special chlorophyll a molecules,
differing from other chlorophyll a molecules because of their special arrangement among nearby proteins and
thylakoid membrane constituents. Chlor
