Use average bond enthalpies from Table 8.4 to estimate 
the enthalpies of the following gas-phase reactions:
 
 Reaction 1:  HF1g2 + H2O1g2 ∆ F-1g2 + H3O+1g2
 
 Reaction 2:  HCl1g2 + H2O1g2 ∆ Cl-1g2 + H3O+1g2
 
 Are both reactions exothermic? How do these values relate to 
the different strengths of hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acid?
