the coil. Then

Hysteresis
Measurements on magnetic materials often use a torus or toroid, which is like a
long solenoid bent into the shape of a donut (Fig. 20–44), so practically all the
lines of 
remain within the toroid. Consider a toroid with an iron core that is
initially unmagnetized and there is no current in the wire loops. Then the current I
is slowly increased, and 
(which is due only to I) increases linearly with I. The
total field B also increases, but follows the curved line shown in Fig. 20–45
which is a graph of total B vs.
Initially, point a, the domains are randomly 
oriented. As
