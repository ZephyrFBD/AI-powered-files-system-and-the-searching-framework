s humans, produce a small number of
relatively large offspring that require extensive parental care until they mature. Reproduction occurs repeatedly
during their lifetimes.
Human Population Growth
About a thousand years ago, the human population began exponential growth. By increasing the carrying capacity of
the environment and by immigrating to previously unoccupied habitats, the following factors made exponential
growth possible:
1. Increases in food supply. By domesticating animals and plants, humans were able to change from a
hunter/gatherer lifestyle to one of agriculture. In the last half-century, food output from agriculture increased as a
result of various technological advances, including the development and application of fertilizers and pesticides and
the construction of irrigation systems.
2. Reduction in disease. Advances in medicine, such as the discoveries of antibiotics, vaccines, and proper hygiene,
reduced the death rate and increased the rate of growth.
3. Reductio
