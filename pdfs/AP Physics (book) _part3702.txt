Distant Stars and Galaxies
Parallax can be used to determine the distance to stars as far away as about
100 light-years from Earth, and from an orbiting spacecraft perhaps 5 to 10 times
farther. Beyond that distance, parallax angles are too small to measure. For
greater distances, more subtle techniques must be employed. We might compare
the apparent brightnesses of two stars, or two galaxies, and use the inverse square
law (apparent brightness drops off as the square of the distance) to roughly esti-
mate their relative distances. We can’t expect this technique to be very precise
because we don’t expect any two stars, or two galaxies, to have the same intrinsic
luminosity. When comparing galaxies, a perhaps better estimate assumes the
brightest stars in all galaxies (or the brightest galaxies in galaxy clusters) ar
