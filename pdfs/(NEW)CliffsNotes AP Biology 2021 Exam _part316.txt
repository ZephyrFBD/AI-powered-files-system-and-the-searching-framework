 concluded that the radioactive DNA from the
phages provided the genetic information needed to make new viruses.
4. Watson, Crick, Wilkins, and Franklin determine the structure of DNA. Using DNA prepared in the lab of
biophysicist Maurice Wilkins, chemist Rosalind Franklin produced an X-ray diffraction photograph of DNA. X-ray
diffraction creates a black-and-white pattern of spots that reveal certain structural characteristics of crystals. For
DNA, the pattern revealed that the molecule consisted of two strands wrapped around each other (a double helix).
Franklin also proposed that sugar-phosphate material formed the outside of the double helix because of its
hydrophilic properties, while the hydrophobic nitrogenous bases were located on the inside of the molecule. Using
that information, molecular biologists James Watson and Francis Crick proposed a model of DNA resembling a
twisted ladder, where the vertical sides of the ladder are sugar-phosphate molecules and its horizontal rungs a
