tes how seriously a meter can affect a circuit and give
a misleading reading. If the resistance of a voltmeter is much higher than the
resistance of the circuit, however, it will have little effect and its readings can be
more accurate, at least to the manufactured precision of the meter, which for
analog meters is typically 3% to 4% of full-scale deflection. Even an ammeter can
interfere with a circuit, but the effect is minimal if its resistance is much less than
that of the circuit as a whole. For both voltmeters and ammeters, the more sensi-
tive the galvanometer, the less effect it will have on the circuit. [A 
meter is far better than a

Whenever we make a measurement on a circuit, to some degree we affect
that circuit (Example 19â€“17). This is true for other types of measurement as well:
when we make a measurement on a system, we affect that system in some way.
On a temperature measurement, for example, the thermometer can exchange
heat with the system, thus altering the temper
