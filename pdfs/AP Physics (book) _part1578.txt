 at 245°C is placed in a 145-g aluminum
calorimeter cup containing 825 g of water at 12.0°C?
15. (II) A 31.5-g glass thermometer reads 23.6°C before it is
placed in 135 mL of water. When the water and thermom-
eter come to equilibrium, the thermometer reads 41.8°C.
What was the original temperature of the water? Ignore
the mass of fluid inside the glass thermometer.

Problem 16.
16. (II) A 0.40-kg iron horseshoe, just forged and very hot
(Fig. 14–16), is dropped into 1.25 L of water in a 0.30-kg
iron pot initially at 20.0°C. If the final equilibrium temper-
ature is 25.0°C, estimate the initial temperature of the hot
horseshoe.
