 6.103 Scientists have speculated that element 126 might have a 
moderate stability, allowing it to be synthesized and charac-
terized. Predict what the condensed electron conﬁguration 
of this element might be.
 
[6.104] In the experiment shown schematically below, a beam of 
neutral atoms is passed through a magnetic ﬁeld. Atoms that 
have unpaired electrons are deﬂected in different directions 
in the magnetic ﬁeld depending on the value of the elec-
tron spin quantum number. In the experiment illustrated, 
we envision that a beam of hydrogen atoms splits into two 
beams. (a) What is the signiﬁcance of the observation that 
 
 (a) Estimate the energies of photons with wavelengths at the 
maximum for each type of cone. (b) The color of the sky is due 
to scattering of solar light by the molecules of the atmosphere.
