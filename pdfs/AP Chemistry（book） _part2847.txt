 in many places 
to aid in the prevention of tooth decay. Typically. the F- 
ion concentration is adjusted to about 1 ppm. Some water 
supplies are also “hard”; that is, they contain certain cat-
ions such as Ca2 +  that interfere with the action of soap. 
Consider a case where the concentration of Ca2 +  is 8 ppm. 
Could a precipitate of CaF2 form under these conditions? 
(Make any necessary approximations.)
 17.119  Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3) reacts with 
acids in foods to form carbonic acid 1H2CO32, which in 
turn decomposes to water and carbon dioxide gas. In a

cake batter, the CO21g2 forms bubbles and causes the cake 
to rise. (a) A rule of thumb in baking is that 1/2 teaspoon of 
baking soda is neutralized by one cup of sour milk. The acid 
component in sour milk is lactic acid, CH3CH1OH2COOH. 
Write the chemical equation for this neutralization reac-
tion. (b) The density of baking soda is 2.16 g>cm3. Calcu-
