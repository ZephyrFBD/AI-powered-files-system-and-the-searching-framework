ll plasma membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer, so
intrinsic proteins would be stabilized by lipid modification. The
addition of lipid groups would increase its hydrophobicity and
facilitate the insertion of intrinsic proteins in the lipid environment of
the membrane. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). (A) is incorrect
because phosphorylation does not increase hydrophobicity since
phosphate groups are charged. (B) is incorrect because intrinsic
proteins do not need to increase polarity to form stable interactions
with lipids in the membrane. (D) is incorrect because disulfide bridges
do not increase the solubility of proteins in the membrane.
