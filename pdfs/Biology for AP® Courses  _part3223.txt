, and palate to the medulla, in the brainstem. From the
medulla, taste signals travel to the thalamus and then to the primary gustatory cortex. Information from different regions of
the tongue is segregated in the medulla, thalamus, and cortex.
27.4 | Hearing and Vestibular Sensation
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What is the relationship of amplitude and frequency of a sound wave to the attributes of sound?
•
What path does sound travel within the auditory system to the site of transduction of sound?
•
What are the structures of the vestibular system that respond to gravity?
Audition, or hearing, is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions. It enables an organism
to detect and receive information about danger, such as an approaching predator, and to participate in communal exchanges
like those concerning territories or mating. On the other hand, although it is physically linked to the auditory system, the
