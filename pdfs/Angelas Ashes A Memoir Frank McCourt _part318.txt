 The Question takes me to the section St. Finbar’s, and the prefect 
 
 tells me sit over there and shut up. His name is Declan Collopy, he’s 
 
  
  
 fourteen and he has lumps on his forehead that look like horns. He has 
 
 thick ginger eyebrows that meet in the middle and hang over his eyes 
 
 and his arms hang down to his kneecaps. He tells me he’s making this 
 
 the best section in the Confraternity and if I’m ever absent he’ll break 
 
 my arse and send the bits to my mother.There’s no excuse for absence 
 
 because there was a boy in another section that was dying and still 
 
 they brought him in on a stretcher. He says, If you’re ever absent it better 
 
 be a death, not a death in the family but your own death. Do you 
 
 hear me?

 Boys in my section tell me that prefects get rewards if there is perfect 
 
 attendance. Declan wants to get out of school as soon as he can and 
 
 get a job sel
