 What if there is friction?
12. When an object falls freely under the influence of gravity
there is a net force mg exerted on it by the Earth. Yet by
Newton’s third law the object exerts an equal and opposite
force on the Earth. Does the Earth move? Explain.
13. Compare the effort (or force) needed to lift a 10-kg object
when you are on the Moon with the force needed to lift it 
on Earth. Compare the force needed to throw a 2-kg object
horizontally with a given speed on the Moon and on Earth.
14. According to Newton’s third law, each team in a tug of war
(Fig. 4–37) pulls with equal force on the other team. What,
then, determines which team will win?
FIGURE 4;37 Question 14. A tug of war.
Describe the forces on each of the teams and 
on the rope.
15. When you stand still on the ground, how large a force does
the ground exert on you? Why doesn’t this force make you
rise up into the air?
16. Whiplash sometimes results from an automobile accident
when the victim’s car is struck violently
