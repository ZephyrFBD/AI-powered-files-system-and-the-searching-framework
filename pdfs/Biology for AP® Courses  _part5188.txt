be used. The agency admiĴed that the ‘vaccine’ is not based on an
isolated ‘virus’, but comes from a computer-generated model. Frances
Leader was naturally banned from Cult-owned fascist TwiĴer for

generated alleged ‘viruses’ is called ‘in silico’ or ‘in silicon’ –

involved with ‘Covid’ are also produced ‘in silico’ or by computer
