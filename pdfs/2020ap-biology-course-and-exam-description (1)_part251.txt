this simply begins with using the learning 
objectives to craft a question for students to 
investigate. You may choose to give students a list of 
materials they are allowed to use in their experimental 
design or require that students request the equipment 
they feel they need to investigate the question. Working 
with learning objectives to craft questions may include:
§
§ Selecting learning objectives from the course 
framework that relate to the subject currently under 
study, and which may set forth specific tasks, in the 
form of “Design an experiment to…”

§ Rephrasing or refining the learning objectives that

Students should be given latitude to make design

appropriate for their design. It is also helpful for 
individual groups to share with the class their basic 
design to elicit feedback on feasibility. During labs, 
students are encouraged to
