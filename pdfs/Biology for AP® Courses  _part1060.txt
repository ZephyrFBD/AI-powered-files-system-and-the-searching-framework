s a certain level, specific gene expression is initiated, and
the bacteria produce bioluminescent proteins that emit light. Because the number of cells present in the environment (cell
density) is the determining factor for signaling, bacterial signaling was named quorum sensing. In politics and business, a
quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present to vote on an issue.
Quorum sensing uses autoinducers as signaling molecules. Autoinducers are signaling molecules secreted by bacteria to
communicate with other bacteria of the same kind. The secreted autoinducers can be small, hydrophobic molecules such as
acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) or larger peptide-based molecules; each type of molecule has a different mode of action.
When AHL enters target bacteria, it binds to transcription factors, which then switch gene expression on or off (Figure
9.17). The peptide autoinducers stimulate more complicated signaling pathways that include bacterial kinases. The changes
