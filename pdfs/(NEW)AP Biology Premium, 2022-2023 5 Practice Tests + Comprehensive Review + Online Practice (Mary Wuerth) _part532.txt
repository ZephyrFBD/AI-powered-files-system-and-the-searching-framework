ing song.
(B) A predator avoids a brightly colored frog in the rain forest.
(C) A bear slows its metabolism in response to shortened day lengths and cooler temperatures.
(D) A primate grooms its offspring.
6. Why are the metabolic rates of smaller organisms generally higher than those of larger organisms?
(A) Smaller organisms have shorter life spans and therefore must accomplish more activities in less time. This
requires a faster metabolic rate.
(B) Smaller organisms have a higher surface area to volume ratio than larger organisms and lose more heat to
the environment.
(C) Smaller organisms are more likely to be ectothermic than larger organisms and therefore need a higher
metabolic rate to compensate for this.
(D) Smaller organisms consume less food per gram of body weight than larger organisms and therefore need a
higher metabolic rate to compensate for this.
