 are 
diverging. Standard rays 2 and 3 are shown leaving point O 
on your nose. Ray 2 (and other nearby rays) enters your eye.
Notice that rays are diverging as they move to the left of 
image point I.

FIGURE 23–19 Convex mirror: (a) the
focal point is at F, behind the mirror;
(b) the image I of the object at O is
virtual, upright, and smaller than the
object. [Not to scale for Example 23–7.]
3. Sign Conventions
(a) When the object, image, or focal point is on the
reflecting side of the mirror (on the left in our
drawings), the corresponding distance is positive.
If any of these points is behind the mirror (on the
right) the corresponding distance is negative.†
(b) The image height 
is positive if the image is
upright, and negative if inverted, relative to the
object (
is always taken as positive).
4. Check that the analytic solution is consistent with
the ray diagram.
