ans, begin breeding later in life, have longer generation times, and
produce fewer oï¬€spring. They take better care of their young than r-
strategists; they have also evolved to be better at exploiting limited parts
of their environments. There is a continuum between r-selected and K-
selected species, as few communities are made up of strictly r-strategists
or K-strategists.
Every species has a set of conditions that are optimal for its reproductive
strategies; in any ecosystem, the most abundant species will be the one
for which the environment most closely approximates this set of optimal
conditions. If these conditions remain constant, all other things being
equal, the distribution of organisms in an ecosystem should remain
roughly the same.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Without important changes to the environment or available
resources, there is little reason to expect a population to boom or
crash. However, these kinds of significant changes are inevitable
over time, and they determine which sp
