 the BCL-2 gene is mutated and becomes activated
inappropriately. Cells with this mutated, overexpressed gene fail to
undergo apoptosis; they continue to divide and form cancerous
tumors. The mutated gene causes many cancers, including
lymphoma and breast, colon, and prostate cancers. Oblimersen is a
drug now in clinical trials that is an antisense RNA. It binds to BCL-
2 mRNA and inactivates it. Which of the following illustrations
accurately demonstrates the action of the antisense drug
Oblimersen?
