solved for pH equally well using the 
Henderson–Hasselbalch equation in the last step.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
If you think carefully about what happens during the course of a 
weak acid–strong base titration, you can learn some very interest-
ing things. For example, let’s look back at Figure 17.9 and pretend 
you did not know that acetic acid was the acid being titrated. You 
can figure out the pKa of a weak acid just by thinking about the 
definition of Ka and looking at the right place on the titration 
curve! Which of the following choices is the best way to do this?
(a) At the equivalence point, pH = pKa. (b) Halfway to the 
equivalence point, pH = pKa. (c) Before any base is added, 
pH = pKa. (d) At the top of the graph with excess base added, 
pH = pKa.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
(a) Calculate the pH in the solution formed by adding  
10.0 mL of 0.050 M NaOH to 40.0 mL of 0.0250 M benzoic 
acid 1C6H5COOH, Ka = 6.3 * 10-52. (b) Calculate the pH 
in the solution formed by adding 10.0
