 potential closest to the water potential of the
0.35 molar sucrose solution used in the experiment. Justify your answer with evidence from the
experiment.
(d) It is determined that the sugar content in each vegetable is the major determinant of the vegetable’s water
potential. Turnips have a higher sugar content than carrots but a lower sugar content than beets. If the
experiment was repeated and included turnip cubes, predict the percent change in mass for the turnip
cubes. Justify your prediction with evidence from the experiment.
Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (B) The solute potential of distilled water is defined as zero bars; it is the reference point to which other
solutions are compared. Since the solute potential is zero, it is neither negative nor positive, so choices (A) and
(C) are incorrect. The solute potential of distilled water is 0 bars, regardless of its temperature, so choice (D) is
incorrect.
2. (C) ψs = –iCRT. In this example, i = 1, C = 0.25 moles per lite
