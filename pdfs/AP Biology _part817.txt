Introduction
One way to study evolution is to study how the frequency of alleles in a
population changes over time. Mathematical models and computer

simulations are tools used to explore evolution in this way.
Hardy-Weinberg theory describes the characteristics of a population
that is stable or nonevolving. In a stable population, the allelic frequencies
do not change from generation to generation. The Hardy-Weinberg
equation enables us to calculate the frequencies of alleles in the
population. The equation is:
p2+2pq+q2=1orp+q=1
Sample problems can be found in Chapter 11 of this book or in the
practice questions at the end of this chapter.
Objective
You will apply mathematical methods to data from real and simulated
populations to predict what will happen to an evolving population.
You will use data from mathematical models ba
