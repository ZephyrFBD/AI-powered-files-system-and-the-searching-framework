he region of the electromag-
netic spectrum to which each belongs.
 6.28  An AM radio station broadcasts at 1010 kHz, and its FM 
partner broadcasts at 98.3 MHz. Calculate and compare the 
 
energy of the photons emitted by these two radio stations.
 6.29  One type of sunburn occurs on exposure to UV light of 
wavelength in the vicinity of 325 nm. (a) What is the 
energy of a photon of this wavelength? (b) What is the 
energy of a mole of these photons? (c) How many pho-
tons are in a 1.00 mJ burst of this radiation? (d) These UV 
photons can break chemical bonds in your skin to cause 
sunburn—a form of radiation damage. If the 325-nm radia-
tion provides exactly the energy to break an average chem-
ical bond in the skin, estimate the average energy of these 
bonds in kJ>mol.
 6.30  The energy from radiation can be used to cause the rupture 
of chemical bonds. A minimum energy of 242 kJ>mol is 
required to break the chlorine–chlorine bond in Cl2. What is 
the longest wavelength of radi
