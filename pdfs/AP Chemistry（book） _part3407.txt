The nuclei produced in Equations 21.24 and 21.25—called the fission products—are them-
selves radioactive and undergo further nuclear decay. More than 200 isotopes of 35 ele-
ments have been found among the fission products of uranium-235. Most of them are 
radioactive.
Slow-moving neutrons are required for the fission of uranium-235 because the pro-
cess involves initial absorption of the neutron by the nucleus. The resulting more mas-
sive nucleus is extremely unstable and spontaneously undergoes fission. Fast neutrons 
tend to bounce off the nucleus, and little fission occurs.
Note that the coefficients of the neutrons produced in Equations 21.24 and 21.25 
are 2 and 3, respectively. On average, 2.4 neutrons are produced by every fission of a ura-
nium-235 nucleus. If one fission produces two neutrons, the two neutrons can cause two
