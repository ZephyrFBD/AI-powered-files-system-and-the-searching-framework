 12.69  Both covalent-network solids and ionic solids can have 
melting points well in excess of room temperature, and both 
can be poor conductors of electricity in their pure form. 
However, in other ways their properties are quite different.
(a) Which type of solid is more likely to dissolve in water?
(b) Which type of solid can become a considerably better 
conductor of electricity via chemical substitution?
 12.70  Which of the following properties are typical characteris-
tics of a covalent-network solid, a metallic solid, or both: 
 
(a) ductility, (b) hardness, (c) high melting point?
 12.71  For each of the following pairs of semiconductors, which 
one will have the larger band gap: (a) CdS or CdTe, (b) GaN 
or InP
, (c) GaAs or InAs?
 12.72  For each of the following pairs of semiconductors, which 
one will have the larger band gap: (a) InP or InAs, (b) Ge or 
AlP
, (c) AgI or CdTe?
 12.73  If you want to dope GaAs to make an n-type semiconductor 
with an element to repla
