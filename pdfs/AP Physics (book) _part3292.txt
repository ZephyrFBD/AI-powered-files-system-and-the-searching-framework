FIGURE 29–38 An OLED with two organic
layers. Hole–electron recombination into an
exciton (dashed circle) occurs in the 
emissive layer, followed by photon emission.
Photons emitted in the wrong direction
(upward in the diagram) reduce efficiency.
OLED (Organic LED)
Many organic compounds have semiconductor properties. Useful ones can have
mobile electrons and holes. A practical organic electroluminescent (EL) device,
an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) was first described in the late 1980s.
Organic compounds contain carbon (C), hydrogen (H), often nitrogen and
oxygen, and sometimes other atoms. We usually think of them as coming from
life—plants and animals. They are also found in petroleum, and some can be
synthesized in the lab. Organic compounds can be complex, and often contain
the familiar hexagonal “benzene ring” with C atoms at all (or most) of the six
corners. The two organic compounds shown in Fig. 29–37 were used as n-ty
