he discovery of the cosmic microwave background radia-

a temperature of 2.725 K.
The Standard Model of the Big Bang provides a possible
scenario as to how the universe developed as it expanded and
cooled after the Big Bang. Starting at 
seconds after the
Big Bang, according to this model, the universe underwent a
brief but rapid exponential expansion, referred to as inflation.
Shortly thereafter,
quarks were confined
into hadrons 
(the hadron era). About 
after the Big Bang, the majority
of hadrons disappeared, having combined with anti-hadrons,
producing photons, leptons, and energy, leaving mainly photons
and leptons to freely move, thus introducing the lepton era.
By the time the universe was about 10 s old, the electrons too
had mostly disappeared, having combined with their antiparticles;
the universe was radiation-dominated. A couple of minutes
later, nucleosynthesis began, but lasted only a few minutes. It
then took al
