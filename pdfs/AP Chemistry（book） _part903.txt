red lines occur at wavelengths 
present in the emission. The black regions 
are wavelengths for which no light is 
produced in the emission.

Give It Some Thought
With reference to Figure 6.6, are the allowed energy states in the Bohr model for the 
H atom more like steps or more like a ramp?
The Energy States of the Hydrogen Atom
Starting with his three postulates and using classical equations for motion and for  
interacting 
electrical charges, Bohr calculated the energies corresponding to the  
allowed orbits for the 
electron in the hydrogen atom. Ultimately, the calculated energies fit the formula
 
E = 1-hcRH2a 1
n2 b = 1-2.18 * 10 - 18 J2a 1

where h, c, and RH are the Planck constant, the speed of light, and the Rydberg constant, 
respectively. The integer n, which can have whole-number values of 1, 2, 3, …∞, is called 
the principal quantum number.
Each allowed orbit corresponds to a different value of n. The rad
