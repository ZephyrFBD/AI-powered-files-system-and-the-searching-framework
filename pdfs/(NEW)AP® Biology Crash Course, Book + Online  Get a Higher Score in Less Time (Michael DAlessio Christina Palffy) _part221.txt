Interpretation of this Experiment
According to the above chart, the wet mass of the brussels sprouts decreased over 15 days and
eventually the larvae consumed 19 g of the brussels sprouts after growing for 3 days. The plant-energy
row demonstrates the transfer of energy from the plant to the larvae: The plant produces the energy for
the butterfly to consume it. The plant-energy-consumed row reiterates this finding, and in fact, the wet
mass of the larvae themselves increases as they consume the water content of the brussels sprouts. You
want to familiarize yourself with this type of data chart and be able to read it and draw conclusions.
