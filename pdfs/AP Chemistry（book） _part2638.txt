 16.5  The following diagrams represent aqueous solutions of 
three acids, HX, HY, and HZ. The water molecules have been 
omitted for clarity, and the hydrated proton is represented 
as H+ rather than H3O+. (a) Which of the acids is a strong 
acid? Explain. (b) Which acid would have the smallest acid- 
dissociation constant, Ka? (c) Which solution would have 
the highest pH? [Sections 16.5 and 16.6]
 16.7  Which of these statements about how the percent ioniza-
tion of a weak acid depends on acid concentration is true?

(a) Line A is most accurate because Ka does not depend on 
concentration.
(b) Line A is the most accurate because the percent ioniza-
tion of the acid does not depend on concentration.
(c) Line B is the
