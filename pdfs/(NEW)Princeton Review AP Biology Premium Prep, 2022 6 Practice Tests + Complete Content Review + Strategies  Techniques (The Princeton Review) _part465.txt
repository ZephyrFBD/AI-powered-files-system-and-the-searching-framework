ions are qualitative. Most data
on the AP Biology Exam will be quantitative, with either counts or measurements.
Count Data
Count data are generated by counting the number of items that fit into a category. For example, you could count the
number of organisms with a particular phenotype or the number of animals in one habitat versus another. Count data
also include data that is collected as percentages or the results of a genetic cross. This type of data is usually
summarized in a bar graph or a pie graph. For example, suppose a mixed population of E. coli were plated on
growth plates. Some cells contained a Î²-galactosidase marker and grew in blue colonies, while others did not contain
the marker and grew in white colonies. The colonies were counted after 24 hours of growth.
In another example, suppose fly populations were monitored in northern Maine to determine if population size
varies over the warm months of the year.
Count data can be analyzed with hypothesis testing, which will b
