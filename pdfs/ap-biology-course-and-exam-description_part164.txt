making a claim, supporting it with evidence, 
and providing reasoning to support the 
claim. In this unit and throughout the course, 
students should become proficient in 
argumentation by predicting the causes or 
effects of a change in, or disruption to, one or 
more components in a biological system.
Preparing for the AP Exam 
Students often do not understand the 
difference between a gene and an allele. 
Gene expression occurs at many levels, all of 
which are crucial in producing an organism’s 
phenotype. Students can use the lac operon 
in E. coli to help them understand the 
significance of positive gene regulation. 
Often on the exam, students fail to provide 
reasoning connecting a change on the 
molecular level (e.g., a mutation) to a change 
in phenotype (e.g., an increase or decrease in 
protein levels). Students should understand 
that the location of a mutation in the codon 
can affect the structure and function of a 
protein. Common errors include stating 
that mutati
