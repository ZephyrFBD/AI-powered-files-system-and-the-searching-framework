,4 and α 1,6 glycosidic linkages. Because of the way the subunits are joined, the glucose
chains have a helical structure. Glycogen (not shown) is similar in structure to amylopectin but more highly branched.
Glycogen is the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates and is made up of monomers of glucose. Glycogen
is the animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored in liver and muscle cells. Whenever
blood glucose levels decrease, glycogen is broken down to release glucose in a process known as glycogenolysis.
Cellulose is the most abundant natural biopolymer. The cell wall of plants is mostly made of cellulose; this provides
structural support to the cell. Wood and paper are mostly cellulosic in nature. Cellulose is made up of glucose monomers
that are linked by β 1-4 glycosidic bonds (Figure 3.11).
