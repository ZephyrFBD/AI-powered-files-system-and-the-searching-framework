shock proteins are encoded by DNA sequences that include
temperature sensitive RNA sequences, known as RNA
thermometers. The 5′-UTR region of these RNA thermometers fold
in a conformation that prevents ribosomes from binding when
temperatures are low.
Wild type E. coli strains synthesize Hsp70 shock proteins aȇer
exposure to heat. A microbiologist isolates a mutant strain of E.
coli that thrives at 22°C, but quickly dies when transferred to a
temperature of 40°C. To study the heat response in the mutant
strain, the microbiologist transforms mutant cells with the
following plasmids and records the results.
