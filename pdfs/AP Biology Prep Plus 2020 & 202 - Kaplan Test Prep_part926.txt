Construct an appropriately labeled graph to analyze the eﬀect
of temperature over time on oxygen consumption of
germinating corn seeds.
(a)
Based on the data, explain the diﬀerences in oxygen
consumption between non-germinating and germinating corn
seeds. Describe the most likely eﬀect of temperature on the
rate of cellular respiration. Predict the likely oxygen
consumption for germinating corn at 20°C aȇer 20 min.
(b)
Propose an appropriate control treatment for the experiment,
and describe how the control treatment would increase the
validity of the results.
(c)
The tetrazolium test is an alternative test for seed viability, in
which seeds are incubated in tetrazolium, rinsed, and then
evaluated for color. In the presence of hydrogen ions,
tetrazolium is reduced from a colorless compound to a red
compound. Predict the color of non-germinating and
germinating corn seeds
