ode in a phylogenetic tree.
A node represents a common ancestor. This means that the species that branch from that point had a common
ancestor and were once the same species. That species got split and each group evolved differently.
(b) Identify two of the viruses that are LEAST similar to GGE.
Two viruses with the least similarity to GGE are YF and SRE. Actually, YF and TYU and SRE are all distantly related
to GGE.
(c) In 50 years, new data have identified that TBEwest(Hypr) is no longer in circulation, but it seems to have
evolved in two directions: TBEwest1 and TBEwest2. Using the empty tree below, correctly indicate
TBEwest(neu), TBEwest(Kuml), TBEwest1m and TBEwest2.
(d) This phylogenetic tree was created using nucleotide sequences. If protein sequences were used instead, explain
why this might increase the similarity between the viruses?
If protein sequences were used, the sequences might show more similarity because there is more than one codon
for some amino acids. This means
