hrough pores that
exit the body.
3. Nephridia (singular, nephridium) occur in pairs within each segment of most segmented worms, such as
earthworms. Interstitial fluids enter a nephridium through a ciliated opening called a nephrostome. Fluids are
concentrated as they pass through the collecting tubule due to selective secretion of materials into the surrounding
coelomic fluid. Blood capillaries that surround the tubule reabsorb the secreted materials. At the end of the
collecting tubule, the concentrated waste materials are excreted through an excretory pore. Nephridia exemplify a
tube-type excretory system, where body fluids are selectively filtered as they pass through the tube. Materials to be
retained are secreted back into the body fluids, while concentrated wastes continue through the tube to be excreted at
the far end.
4. Malpighian tubules occur in many arthropods, such as terrestrial insects. Tubes attached to the midsection of the
digestive tract of insects (midgut) collect
