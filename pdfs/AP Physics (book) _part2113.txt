Safe Wiring
Why is a third wire needed? The 120 V is carried by the other two wires—one
hot (120 V ac), the other neutral, which is itself grounded. The third “dedicated”
ground wire with the round prong may seem redundant. But it is protection for
two reasons: (1) It protects against internal wiring that may have been done
incorrectly or is faulty as discussed above, Fig. 19–26. (2) The neutral wire carries
the full normal current (“return” current from the hot 120 V) and it does have
resistance—so there can be a voltage drop along the neut
