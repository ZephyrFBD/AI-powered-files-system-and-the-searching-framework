up the ether is not too hard, however, since it had never been detected. But the
second postulate also tells us that the speed of light in vacuum is always the same,
no matter what the speed of the observer or the source. Thus, a per-
son traveling toward or away from a source of light will measure the same speed
for that light as someone at rest with respect to the source. This conflicts with our
everyday experience: we would expect to have to add in the velocity of the observer.
On the other hand, perhaps we can’t expect our everyday experience to be 
helpful when dealing with the high velocity of light. Furthermore, the null result of
the Michelson–Morley experiment is fully consistent with the second postulate.†
Einstein’s proposal has a certain beauty. By doing away with the idea of an
absolute reference frame, it was possible to reconcile classical mechanics with
Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory. The speed of light predicted by Maxwell’s
equations is the speed of light in vacu
