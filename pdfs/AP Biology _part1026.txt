large intestine. Choice A is incorrect because that statement
describes ligase, not EcoRI. Choice C and choice D are both
incorrect because EcoRI is not involved in either transcription or
replication, even in E. coli bacteria.
(D) RNA processing occurs in the nucleus after transcription.
During this process, introns are excised from the pre-RNA, and a 5'
cap and a poly-A tail are added onto the pre-RNA transcript. Choice
A is incorrect because splicing out introns occurs in the nucleus
(after transcription), not in the cytoplasm. Choice B is incorrect
because snRNPs have nothing t
