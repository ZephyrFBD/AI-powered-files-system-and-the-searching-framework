lecule encounters this site in the protein, 
an electron transfer reaction takes place in which the O2 molecule is 
reduced to the peroxide ion, O2
2-, while both copper ions are oxidized to 
Cu2+, as shown in Figure 23.1. The presence of Cu2+ ions in oxygenated 
hemocyanine is responsible for the blue color of the blood.
Among the blue bloods of the animal kingdom, the blood of 
the horseshoe crab is the most valuable. Thatâ€™s because the primitive 
immune system of the horseshoe crab contains a substance called lim-
ulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL), which protects the crabs from infection 
by binding to potentially harmful viruses and bacterial endotoxins. It 
was discovered in the early 1960s that LAL could be used to detect trace 
amounts of toxic substances in drugs and medical devices. The U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration now requires that all drugs intended for 
human consumption be tested with LAL.
To obtain sufficient quantities of LAL for the pharmaceutical indus-
try, people ha
