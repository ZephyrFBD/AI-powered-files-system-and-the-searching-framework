■ Summative Assessment 
This section describes suggestions for assessing students’ understanding of the concepts 
presented in the investigation, but you are encouraged to develop your own methods 
of postlab assessment. Each student (or group of students) should present data from a 
repeated, controlled experiment with graphic representation and quantitative analysis of 
fruit fly choices. 
1. Have students record their experimental design, procedures, data, results, and 
conclusions in a lab notebook, or have them construct a mini-poster to share with 
their classmates. 
2. Revisit the learning ob
