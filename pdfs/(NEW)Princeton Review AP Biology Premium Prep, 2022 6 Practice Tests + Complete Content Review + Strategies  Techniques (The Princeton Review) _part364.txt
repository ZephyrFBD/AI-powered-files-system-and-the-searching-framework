 bit trickier than
transformation. Because eukaryotic cells do not grow like bacteria do, transfection is not as useful for making large
quantities of something, but sometimes it is important to use eukaryotic cells.
Gel Electrophoresis
An important part of DNA technology is the ability to observe differences in different preparations of DNA.
DNA fragments can be separated according to their molecular weight and charge with gel electrophoresis. Because
DNA and RNA are negatively charged, they migrate through a gel toward the positive pole of the electrical field.
The smaller the fragments, the faster they move through the gel. Restriction enzymes are also used to create a
molecular fingerprint. The patterns created after cutting with restriction enzymes are unique for each person because
each personâ€™s DNA is slightly different. Some people might have sequences that are cut many times, resulting in
many tiny fragments, and others might have sequences that are cut infrequently, producing
