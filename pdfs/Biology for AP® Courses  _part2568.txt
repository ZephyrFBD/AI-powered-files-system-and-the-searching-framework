covery to better
understand the evolution of mechanisms related to the
ability to capture, store, and use free energy in
prokaryotes, which question would you pose to answer?
a.
Have metabolic pathways evolved separately in
Bacteria and Archaea?
b.
Should all methanogens be classed as Archaea in
evolutionary phylogeny?
c.
Have methanogens evolved to live in both
moderate and extreme environments?
d.
Did the methanogenic bacteria species also
evolve as a strict anaerobe?
66. What is another question you might pose to learn more
about the structural features that allow for the capture,
storage, and use of free energy by archaean methanogens?

a.
Do archaean methanogens differ from other
Archaea structurally, and if so, in what way? Is
one or more of these structural differences
related to these methanogensâ€™ ability to use H2
to oxidize CO2?
b.
Do archaean meth
