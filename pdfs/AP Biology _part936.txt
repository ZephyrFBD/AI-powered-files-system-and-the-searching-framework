highest precipitation.
(D) The graph flattens out but doesnâ€™t decrease. Therefore,
photosynthesis is still going on. That indicates that choices B and C
cannot be correct. Choice A is not correct because chlorophyll
molecules do not decompose due to heat or light; they are meant to
absorb light and tolerate heat.
(A) Remember that operons are only found in prokaryotes, not in
higher organisms (like mammals). However, higher animals may
utilize a similar mechanism. For that reason, you must eliminate
choice B. Operons are a means of controlling the transcription of
genes, whereas choice C focuses on what happens after
transcription. Operons have nothing to do with the cell cycle, which
rules out choice D.
(B) Oxygen (O2) in the air comes from molecules of water (H20)
that plants absorb at their roots. The process of hydrolysis releases
oxygen from water into the air.
