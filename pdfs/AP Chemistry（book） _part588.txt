s be positive:
(a)  
The oxidation number of oxygen is usually -2 in both ionic and molecular com-
pounds. The major exception is in compounds called peroxides, which contain 
the O2
2- ion, giving each oxygen an oxidation number of -1.
(b)  
The oxidation number of hydrogen is usually +1 when bonded to nonmetals and -1 
when bonded to metals (for example, metal hydrides such as sodium hydride, NaH).
(c)  
The oxidation number of fluorine is -1 in all compounds. The other halogens 
have an oxidation number of -1 in most binary compounds. When combined 
with oxygen, as in oxyanions, however, they have positive oxidation states.
4. The sum of the oxidation numbers of all atoms in a neutral compound is zero. The 
sum of the oxidation numbers in a polyatomic ion equals the charge of the ion. For exam-
ple, in the hydronium ion H3O+, which is a more accurate description of H +1aq2, 
the oxidation number of each hydrogen is +1 and that of oxygen is -2. Thus, the 
sum of the oxidation numbers
