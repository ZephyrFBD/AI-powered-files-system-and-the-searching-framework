cold air at high altitudes. Contrails disperse very quickly while
chemtrails do not and spread out across the sky before eventually
their content falls to earth. Many times I have watched aircraĞ cross-
cross a clear blue sky releasing chemtrails until it looks like a cloudy
day. Chemtrails contain many things harmful to humans and the
natural world including toxic heavy metals, aluminium (see
Alzheimer’s) and nanotechnology. Ray Kurzweil reveals the reason
without actually saying so: ‘Nanobots will infuse all the maĴer
around us with information. Rocks, trees, everything will become

Self-replicating nanobots would connect everything to the Smart

era and the correlation has led to it being dubbed the ‘chemtrail
disease’. Self-replicating ﬁbres appear in the body that can be pulled
