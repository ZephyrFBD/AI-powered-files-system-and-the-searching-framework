lobular protein) has a combination of hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds that cause it to be mostly
clumped into a ball shape. Insulin starts out as a single polypeptide and loses some internal sequences in the presence of
post-translational modification after the formation of the disulfide linkages that hold the remaining chains together. Silk (a
fibrous protein), however, has a Î²-pleated sheet structure that is the result of hydrogen bonding between different chains.
The four levels of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary) are illustrated in Figure 3.32.
