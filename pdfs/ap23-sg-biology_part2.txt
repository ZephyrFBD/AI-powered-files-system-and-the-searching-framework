enabling Pho4 to induce the expression of these target genes. A simplified model of this pathway is shown in

To study the role of the different proteins in the PHO pathway, researchers used a wild-type strain of yeast to 
create a strain with a mutant form of Pho81 (pho81mt) and a strain with a mutated form of Pho4 (pho4mt). 
In each of these mutant strains, researchers measured the activity of a particular enzyme, APase, which 
removes phosphates from its substrates and is encoded by PHO1, a Pho target gene (Table 1). They then 
determined the level of PHO1 mRNA relative to that of the wild-type yeast strain, which was set to 10.
