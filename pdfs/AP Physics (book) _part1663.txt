ny mol-
ecules in a system to be able to know the velocity and position of every one at a
given moment. Nonetheless, we can hypothesize a great many different micro-
states that can correspond to the same macrostate.
Let us take a very simple example. Suppose you repeatedly shake four coins
in your hand and drop them on a table. Specifying the number of heads and the
number of tails that appear on a given throw is the macrostate of this system.
Specifying each coin as being a head or a tail is the microstate of the system. In
the following Table we see how many microstates correspond to each macrostate:

A basic assumption behind the statistical approach is that each microstate is
equally probable. Thus
