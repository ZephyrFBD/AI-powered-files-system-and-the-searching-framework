Mitochondria produce energy for the cell. The mitochondria have double membranes, with a smooth outer
membrane and a folded inner membrane. (See Figure 5.7.) These folds on the inner membrane increase the surface
area available for energy production during cellular respiration, which will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.
The double-membrane structure of the mitochondria also allow them to create the proton gradients that are necessary
for ATP production. The center of the mitochondria is an enzyme-containing fluid called the matrix. The reactions
of the Krebs cycle (the citric acid cycle) occur in the matrix of the mitochondria. Mitochondria also contain their
own mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Chapter 14 of this book will explain why mtDNA is inherited in a non-
Mendelian fashion. Mitochondria also contain their own ribosomes.
