undamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the
nervous system. This takes place at the sensory receptor, and the change in electrical potential that is produced is called the
receptor potential. How is sensory input, such as pressure on the skin, changed to a receptor potential? In this example,
a type of receptor called a mechanoreceptor (as shown in Figure 27.2) possesses specialized membranes that respond to
pressure. Disturbance of these dendrites by compressing them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma
membrane of the sensory neuron, changing its electrical potential. Recall that in the nervous system, a positive change of
a neuronâ€™s electrical potential (also called the membrane potential), depolarizes the neuron. Receptor potentials are graded
potentials: the magnitude of these graded (receptor) potentials varies with the strength of the stimulus. If the magnitude
of depolarization is sufficient (th
