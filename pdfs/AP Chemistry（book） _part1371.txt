al shapes, 
such as bent and trigonal pyramidal, by starting with one of our five basic arrangements. 
Starting with a tetrahedron, for example, we can remove atoms successively from the ver-
tices, as shown in Figure 9.4. When an atom is removed from one vertex of a tetrahedron, 
the remaining AB3 fragment has a trigonal-pyramidal geometry. When a second atom is 
removed, the remaining AB2 fragment has a bent geometry.
Why do most ABn molecules have shapes related to those shown in Figure 9.3? Can 
we predict these shapes? When A is a representative element (one from the s block or p 
block of the periodic table), we can answer these questions by using the valence-shell 
electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) model. Although the name is rather imposing, the 
model is quite simple. It has useful predictive capabilities, as we will see in Section 9.2.

In going from the tetrahedral shape to the bent shape, does it  
matter which two of the atoms we choose to remove?
