ws two enzyme-mediated reactions. One of these
reactions shows an enzyme that was extracted from the stomach,
an environment that is acidic. The other reaction shows an
enzyme that was extracted from the intestine, an environment
that is normally basic (alkaline).
The reaction with the gastric enzyme shows no reactivity at
pH 0, with activity increasing in the acidic range until it reaches
its maximum rate (velocity) of activity (Vmax) at the optimum
pH 4. Above pH 4, the reaction slows down, decreasing to zero
by pH 8.

The reaction with the intestinal enzyme shows no reactivity
at approximately pH 3.8, with increasing activity until it reaches
its maximum rate (Vmax) at its optimum pH 8. Above pH 8, the
reaction slows down, eventually reaching zero by pH 11.8.

In the experiment from part (b), I predict that the rate of the
enzyme-controlled reaction would increase from zero to its
maximum rate (at the optimal temperature [body temperature] of
approximately 38Â°C), and then the reac
