The Cell Cycle
can cause these resting cells to reenter the cell cycle and begin
dividing again.
Mitosis
Mitosis (also known as the M phase) is the process through which a cell
replicates and divides. The following diagram illustrates the four phases
of mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase) and
situates them within the larger cell cycle, which also includes interphase
and cytokinesis, the division of cytoplasm in animal cells that follows the
division of the nucleus when two distinct cells are produced.

The Place of Mitosis in the Cell Cycle
AP EXPERT NOTE
You are not required to know the names of the phases of mitosis
or meiosis for the AP exam. Instead, focus on the overall
processes (replication, alignment, and separation) and the theme
of heredity.
Cell division is primarily controlled through genetics. The DNA in a cell
controls whether a cell div
