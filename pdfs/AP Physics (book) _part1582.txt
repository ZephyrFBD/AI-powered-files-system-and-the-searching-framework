20. (II) A 215-g sample of a substance is heated to 330°C and then
plunged into a 105-g aluminum calorimeter cup containing
185 g of water and a 17-g glass thermometer at 10.5°C.
The final temperature is 35.0°C. What is the specific heat
of the substance? (Assume no water boils away.)
21. (II) A 0.095-kg aluminium sphere is dropped from the roof
of a 55-m-high building. If 65% of the thermal energy pro-
duced when it hits the ground is absorbed by the sphere,
what is its temperature increase?
22. (II) Estimate the Calorie content of 65 g of candy from the
following measurements. A 15-g sample of the candy is
placed in a small aluminum container of mass 0.325 kg
filled with oxygen. This container is placed in 1.75 kg of
water in an aluminum calorimeter cup of mass 0.624 kg at
an initial temperature of 15.0°C. The oxygen–candy mixture
in the small container (a “bomb calorimeter”) is ignited,
