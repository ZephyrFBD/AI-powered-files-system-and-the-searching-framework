Give It Some Thought
Recall that the hydride ion is H -. What is the oxidation state of boron in sodium 
borohydride?
The only important oxide of boron is boric oxide 1B2O32. This substance is the anhy-
dride of boric acid, which we may write as H3BO3 or B1OH23. Boric acid is so weak an acid 
1Ka = 5.8 * 10 - 102 that solutions of H3BO3 are used as an eyewash. Upon heating, boric 
acid loses water by a condensation reaction similar to that described for phosphorus in 
Section 22.8:
 
4 H3BO31s2 ยก H2B4O71s2 + 5 H2O1g2 
[22.71]
The diprotic acid H2B4O7 is tetraboric acid. The hydrated sodium salt Na2B4O7 #  
10 H2O, called borax, occurs in dry lake deposits in California and can also be prepared 
from other borate
