6â€“4 Potential Energy
We have just discussed how an object is said to have energy by virtue of its motion,
which we call kinetic energy. But it is also possible to have potential energy, which is
the energy associated with forces that depend on the position or configuration of an
object (or objects) relative to the surroundings. Various types of potential energy
(PE) can be defined, and each type is associated with a particular force.
The spring of a wind-up toy is an example of an object with potential energy.
The spring acquired its potential energy because work was done on it by the person
winding the toy. As the spring unwinds, it exerts a force and does work to make
the toy move.
Gravitational Potential Energy
Perhaps the most common example of potential energy is gravitational potential
energy. A heavy brick held high above the ground has potential energy because
of its position relative to the Earth. The raised brick has the ability to do work,
