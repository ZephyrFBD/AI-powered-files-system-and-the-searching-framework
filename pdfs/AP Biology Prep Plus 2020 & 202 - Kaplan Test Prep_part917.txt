As water molecules evaporate from a leaf, they increase the water
potential in the stem and cause the uptake of water.
(B)
Water moves up a gradient of water potential from soil to roots.
(C)
Lower water potential in the soil than in the roots causes water to
enter the roots.

In a drug eﬀicacy experiment, samples of E. coli, P. chrysogenum, P. bursaria,
and S. cerevisiae were exposed to the drug, allowing researchers to observe its
eﬀects on bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and yeast, respectively. Samples were plated
on their respective growth plates. An additional set of samples that were not
treated with the drug was plated as well. The results of the experiment are
summarized below. The shaded ar
