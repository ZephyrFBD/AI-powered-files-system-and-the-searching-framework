wing, the central mesophyll is sandwiched between an upper and lower epidermis. The
mesophyll has two layers: an upper palisade layer comprised of tightly packed, columnar cells, and a lower spongy
layer, comprised of loosely packed, irregularly shaped cells. Stomata on the leaf underside allow gas exchange. A
waxy cuticle covers all aerial surfaces of land plants to minimize water loss. These leaf layers are clearly visible in
the (b) scanning electron micrograph. The numerous small bumps in the palisade parenchyma cells are chloroplasts.
Chloroplasts are also present in the spongy parenchyma, but are not as obvious. The bumps protruding from the lower
surface of the leave are glandular trichomes, which differ in structure from the stalked trichomes in Figure 23.25. (credit

Like the stem, the leaf contains vascular bundles composed of xylem and phloem (Figure 23.27). The xylem consists of
tracheids and vessels, which transport water and miner
