will kill any bacteria that have not absorbed the plasmid and therefore are not resistant to
ampicillin. It is expected that no bacteria will be seen on this plate. If a colony of bacteria is seen on this plate,
it could indicate that there was a very rare spontaneous mutation that conferred ampicillin resistance to those
bacteria, but that is a highly improbable, though not impossible, event.
Test tube C does contain the plasmid. Its contents are grown on LB agar, upon which both bacteria with or
without the plasmid will grow, so it is expected that there will be robust growth of bacteria on this plate.
Test tube D does contain the plasmid. Its contents are grown on LB agar to which ampicillin has been added.
Ampicillin will kill any bacteria that have not absorbed the plasmid and therefore are not resistant to ampicillin.
It is expected that any colonies seen on this plate will contain the plasmid with the resistance gene and will be
considered “transformed.”
