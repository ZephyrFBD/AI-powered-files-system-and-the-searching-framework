In many instances later in the text, you will find that knowing the number and 
shapes of atomic orbitals will help you understand chemistry at the molecular level. You 
will therefore find it useful to memorize the shapes of the s, p, and d orbitals shown in 
Figures 6.20, 6.23, and 6.24.
6.7 ∣ Many-Electron Atoms
One of our goals in this chapter has been to determine the electronic structures of 
 
atoms. So far, we have seen that quantum mechanics leads to an elegant descrip-
tion of the hydrogen atom. This atom, however, has only one electron. How does
