ral individual protein chains into a final 
specific shape. (Section 24.7)
racemic mixture A mixture of equal amounts of the 
dextrorotatory and levorotatory forms of a chiral molecule. A 
racemic mixture will not rotate the plane of polarized light. 
(Section 23.4)
rad A measure of the energy absorbed from radiation by tissue 
or other biological material; 1 rad = transfer of 1 * 10-2 J of energy 
per kilogram of material. (Section 21.9)
radial probability function The probability that the electron will 
be found at a certain distance from the nucleus. (Section 6.6)
radioactive Possessing radioactivity, the spontaneous 
disintegration of an unstable atomic nucleus with 
accompanying emission of radiation. (Section 2.2; Chapter 21: 
Introduction)
radioactive decay chain A series of nuclear reactions that begins 
with an unstable nucleus and terminates with a stable one. Also 
called nuclear disintegration series. (Section 21.2)
radioisotope An isotope that is radioactive; that is, it i
