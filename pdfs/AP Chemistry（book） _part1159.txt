on mea-
surements of the distances separating atoms in their chemical com-
pounds. In general, atomic radii increase down a column in the 
periodic table and decrease left to right across a row.
Cations are smaller than their parent atoms; anions are larger 
than their parent atoms. For ions of the same charge, size increases 
going down a column of the periodic table. An isoelectronic series is a 
series of ions that has the same number of electrons. For such a series, 
size decreases with increasing atomic number as the electrons are at-
tracted more strongly to the nucleus as its positive charge increases.
IONIZATION ENERGY (SECTION 7.4) The first ionization energy 
of an atom is the minimum energy needed to remove an electron 
from the atom in the gas phase, forming a cation. The second ion-
ization energy is the energy needed to remove a second electron, 
and so forth. Ionization energies show a sharp increase after all the 
valence electrons have been removed because of the much
