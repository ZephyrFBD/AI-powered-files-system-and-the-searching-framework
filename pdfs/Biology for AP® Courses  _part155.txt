t electrons. In contrast, chlorine and sodium have seven and one in their outer shells, respectively, but
theoretically they would be more energetically stable if they followed the octet rule and had eight.

Figure 2.7 Bohr diagrams indicate how many electrons fill each principal shell. Group 18 elements (helium,
neon, and argon are shown) have a full outer, or valence, shell. A full valence shell is the most stable electron
configuration. Elements in other groups have partially filled valence shells and gain or lose electrons to achieve a
stable electron configuration.

An atom may give, take, or share electrons with another atom to achieve a full valence shell, the most stable electron
configuration. Looking at this figure, how many electrons do elements in group 1 need to lose in order to achieve a
stable electron
