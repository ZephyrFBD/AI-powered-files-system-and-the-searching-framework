ore electrons to it. If we place the remaining six electrons 
around N to give it an octet, we do not achieve an octet on C:
We therefore try a double bond between C and N, using one of the 
unshared pairs we placed on N. Again we end up with fewer than 
eight electrons on C, and so we next try a triple bond. This struc-
ture gives an octet around both C and N:
The octet rule is satisfied for the C and N atoms, and the H atom 
has two electrons around it. This is a correct Lewis structure.
