0 mm Hg partial pressure myoglobin is nearly 
saturated with oxygen, whereas hemoglobin is only about 10 percent saturated.
(C)
This option is correct. The question tests whether the student can read the 
graph to analyze the data. The graph indicates that at 40 mm Hg pressure, 
myoglobin binds a greater amount of oxygen than hemoglobin.
(D)
This option is incorrect because the saturation of both hemoglobin and 
myoglobin with oxygen is nearly equal.

Question 52
Essential Knowledge
4.B.1: Interactions between molecules affect their 
structure and function.
Science Practice
5.1: The student can analyze data to identify patterns  
or relationships.
Learning Objective 
4.17: The student is able to analyze data to identify how 
molecular interactions affect structure and function.
(A)
This option is correct. If the curve shifts to the right, both hemoglobin and 
myoglobin are less saturated at a given partial pressure of oxygen, thus 
indicating that the oxygen has been unload
