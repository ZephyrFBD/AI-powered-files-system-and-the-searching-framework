dded 
electron leads to an np4 configuration, so the electron must be added 
to an orbital that already has one electron in it, and thus experiences 
more electron-electron repulsion. Figure 7.13 They are opposite: 
As ionization energy increases, metallic character decreases, and 
vice versa. Figure 7.15 Anions are above and to the right of the 
line; cations are below and to the left of the line. Figure 7.16 No. 
The Na+ and NO3
- ions will simply be spectator ions. The H+ ions 
of an acid are needed in order to dissolve NiO. Figure 7.17 No. 
As seen in the photo, sulfur crumbles as it is hit with a hammer, 
typical of a solid nonmetal. Figure 7.21 Because Rb is below K in 
the periodic table, and has a lower first ionization energy we expect 
Rb to be more reactive with water than K. Figure 7.23 Lilac (see 
Figure 7.22). Figure 7.25 The bubbles are due to H21g2. This 
could be confirmed by carefully testing the bubbles with a flame—
there should be popping as the hydrogen gas ignite
