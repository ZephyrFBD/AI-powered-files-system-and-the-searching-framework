Bark, cork cambium, cuticle
V.
Solution:
Hypersensitive response
Example:
Any example of a plant displaying genetic-based disease
resistance
VI.
Solution:
Systemic acquired resistance (SAR)
Example:
Any example of a plant displaying SAR or carrying SAR
Genes
Water Stress, Desiccation
VII.
Solution:
Any responses that restore water status
Examples/Structures:
Water-impermeable cuticle
Recessed stomates or “hairy” stomates
Closing of stomates by action of guard cells
CAM/C4 plants
Plants that suppress leaf growth
Plants displaying wilting and leaf rolling
Plants displaying leaf drop
Seed coat
Vascular tissue for water transport
Plants with reduced leaf surface area (needles, spines)
Highly dispersed, shallow root growth to absorb flash rains
Root growth in unlikely places (e.g., water mains)
Cactus needles’ shading of cactus stem
Plants that display hydrotropism
Plants that release allelopathic compounds (inhibit the
growth of nearby competitors)
