is, where they swell up with water
and burst. It should be noted, however, that most cells have mechanisms to prevent them from taking on too much water.
However, red blood cells lack these controls, making them ideal for osmolarity studies.
This is an important consideration for clinicians delivering drugs intravenously. How would the drug have to be formulated,
in terms of osmolarity, to prevent red blood cells from undergoing hemolysis? In order to prevent hemolysis of red blood
cells in the blood, drugs are typically formulated in an isotonic solution with the blood to maintain osmolarity.
Tonicity
Tonicity describes how an extracellular solution can change the volume of a cell by affecting osmosis. A solution's tonicity
often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution. Osmolarity describes the total solute concentration of the
solution. A solution with low osmolarity has a greater number of water molecules relative to the number of solute particles;
a solution with hi
