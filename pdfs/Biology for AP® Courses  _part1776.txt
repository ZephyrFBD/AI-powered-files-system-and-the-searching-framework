Describe the major events that occur during eukaryotic transcription.
a.
DNA unwinds, transcription factors bind, the termination complex forms, and DNA polymerase adds
nucleotides to the mRNA.
b.
DNA unwinds, transcription factors bind, and RNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the mRNA.
c.
The transcription complex forms, transcription factors add nucleotides to the forming mRNA, and the mRNA
disconnects from the DNA.
d.
Elongation occurs, followed by the formation of the transcription initiation complex and the disconnection
of the mRNA strand from DNA.

The Promoter and the Transcription Machinery
Genes are organized to make the control of gene expression easier. The promoter region is immediately upstream of the
coding sequence. This region can be short (only a few nucleotides in length) or quite long (hundreds of nucleotides long).
The longer the promoter, the more available space for proteins to bind. This also adds more control to the tran
