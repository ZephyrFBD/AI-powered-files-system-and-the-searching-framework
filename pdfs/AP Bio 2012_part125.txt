Question 29
Essential Knowledge
2.D.1: All biological systems from cells and organisms to 
populations, communities, and ecosystems are affected 
by complex biotic and abiotic interactions involving 
exchange of matter and free energy.
Science Practice
7.2: The student can connect concepts in and across 
domain(s) to generalize or extrapolate in and/or across 
enduring understandings and/or big ideas.
Learning Objective 
2.23: The student is able to design a plan for collecting 
data to show that all biological systems (cells, organisms, 
populations, communities, and ecosystems) are affected 
by complex biotic and abiotic interactions.
(A)
This option is incorrect because there is no evidence that yellow seedlings w
