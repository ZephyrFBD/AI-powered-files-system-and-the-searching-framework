onstrictor and increases blood pressure during hemorrhaging.
Atrial Natriuretic Peptide Hormone
The atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) lowers blood pressure by acting as a vasodilator. It is released by cells in the atrium
of the heart in response to high blood pressure and in patients with sleep apnea. ANP affects salt release, and because water
passively follows salt to maintain osmotic balance, it also has a diuretic effect. ANP also prevents sodium reabsorption by
the renal tubules, decreasing water reabsorption (thus acting as a diuretic) and lowering blood pressure. Its actions suppress
the actions of aldosterone, ADH, and renin.
Think About It
Create a diagram to show an example of a hormone and how the hormone works in regulating an osmoregulatory
process such as maintaining blood pressure and blood volume and altering kidney function to reduce the amount of
water eliminated in urine.
