ts it. Another way to state the cosmological principle is that
our place in the universe is not special.
The expansion of the universe, as described by Hubble’s law, strongly
suggests that galaxies must have been closer together in the past than they are
now. This is, in fact, the basis of the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe,
which pictures the universe as a relentless expansion starting from a very hot and
compressed beginning. We discuss the Big Bang in detail shortly, but first let us
see what can be said about the age of the universe.

FIGURE 33–22 Expansion of the universe looks the same from any point in the universe. If you are on Earth
as shown in part (a), or you are instead at galaxy A (which is at rest in the reference frame shown in (b)), all
other galaxies appear to be racing away from you.
