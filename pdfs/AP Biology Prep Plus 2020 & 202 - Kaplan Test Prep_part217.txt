istance to the bacteria. A second culture of E. coli was
grown, and the plasmid was not added to this sample. Both samples
were plated on nutrient agar plates, half of which were supplemented
with ampicillin. The results of E. coli growth are summarized below. The
shaded area represents extensive growth of bacteria, while dots
represent individual colonies of bacteria.
5. Scientists must be careful when inserting plasmids into bacteria in
case they mutate or spread accidentally. For example, if a sample
of the modified bacterial culture were to leave the lab and infect
another animal, which of the following provides an example of the
adverse eï¬€ects that could result?
The transformed bacteria will continue secreting insulin,
which will cause the animal to develop chronic high blood
sugar problems.
(A)
The transformed bacteria will continue secreting insulin,
which will cause the animal to stop producing its own insulin.
(B)
The transformed bacteria will continue secreting insulin,
which
