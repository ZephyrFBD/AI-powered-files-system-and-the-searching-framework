 20.40  Given the following half-reactions and associated standard 
reduction potentials:
AuBr4
-1aq2 + 3 e- ¡ Au1s2 + 4 Br-1aq2 
 
 E°
red = -0.86 V
Eu3+1aq2 + e- ¡ Eu2+1aq2 
 
E°

(a) Write the equation for the combination of these half-
cell reactions that leads to the largest positive emf and cal-
culate the value. (b) Write the equation for the combina-
tion of half-cell reactions that leads to the smallest positive 
emf and calculate that value.
 20.41  A 1 M solution of Cu1NO322 is placed in a beaker with a 
strip of Cu metal. A 1 M solution of SnSO4 is placed in a 
second beaker with a strip of Sn metal. A salt bridge con-
nects the two beakers, and wires to a voltmeter link the two 
metal electrodes. (a) Which electrode serves as the anode, 
and which as the cathode? (b) Which elect
