clade may contain multiple
groups, as in the case of animals, fungi and plants, or a single group, as in the case of flagellates. Groups that
diverge at a different branch point, or that do not include all groups in a single branch point, are not considered
clades.
Glycolysis, or the breakdown of glucose, is a process used by almost all organisms as a way to release energy stored
within glucose molecules. This energy can then be stored in cells as ATP, which powers cell processes when needed.
What does this show, in terms of the evolutionary history of cells using glycolysis?
a.
Glycolysis has been conserved despite the independent evolution of the three domains of life.
b.
Prokaryotes would likely not benefit from the Krebs cycle or the ETC.
c.
Prokaryotes likely evolved after eukaryotes.
d.
Glycolysis is the only way in which living things can break down glucose.
Shared Characteristics
Organisms evolve from common ancestors and then diversify. Scientists use the phrase â€œdescent with
