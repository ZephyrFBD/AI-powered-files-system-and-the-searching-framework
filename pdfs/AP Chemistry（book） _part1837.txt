ls either by 
inventing new substances or by developing the means to process natu-
ral materials to form substances that have specific electrical, magnetic, 
optical, catalytic, or mechanical properties. In this chapter, we explore 
the structures and properties of solids. As we do so, we will examine 
some of the solid materials used in modern technology.
12.1 ∣ Classification of Solids
Solids can be as hard as diamond or as soft as wax. Some readily conduct electricity, 
whereas others do not. The shapes of some solids can easily be manipulated, while others 
are brittle and resistant to any change in shape. The physical properties as well as the 
structures of solids are dictated by the types of bonds that hold the atoms in place. We 
can classify solids according to those bonds (Figure 12.1).
Metallic solids are held together by a delocalized “sea” of collectively shared 
valence electrons. This form of bonding allows metals to conduct electricity. It is also 
responsible for the f
