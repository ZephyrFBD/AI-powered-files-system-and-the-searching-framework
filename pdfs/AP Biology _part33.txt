ergy levels, the atom is said to be in the ground state.
When an atom absorbs energy, its electrons move to a higher energy level,
and the atom is said to be in the excited state. For example, when a
chlorophyll molecule in a photosynthetic plant cell absorbs light energy,
the molecule becomes excited and electrons are boosted to a higher energy
level. When an excited electron loses energy, it falls back to a shell closer
to the nucleus.
Isotopes are atoms of one element that vary only in the number of
neutrons in the nucleus. In nature, an element occurs as a mixture of
isotopes. Chemically, all isotopes of the same element are identical
because they have the same number of electrons in the same configuration.
For example: carbon-12 and carbon-14 are isotopes of each other and are
chemically identical. Some isotopes, like carbon-14, are radioactive and
decay at a known rate called the half-life (see page 243). Knowing the
half-life enables us to accurately measure the age of fossils o
