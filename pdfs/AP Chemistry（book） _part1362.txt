◀ SHAPE MATTERS. These two compounds at first glance appear  
identical. But a very small change at one carbon atom makes one 
compound an anti-pain medication and the other a liver toxin.
WHAT’S AHEAD
 
9.1 ▶ Molecular Shapes Draw three-dimensional 
structures of molecules.
 
9.2 ▶ The VSEpr Model Predict molecular 
geometries using the valence-shell electron-pair 
repulsion, or VSEPR, model, which is based on 
Lewis structures and the repulsions between 
regions of high electron density.
 
9.3 ▶ Molecular Shape and Molecular 
polarity Determine whether a molecule is 
polar or nonpolar by analyzing its geometry and 
the types of bonds it contains.
 
9.4 ▶ Covalent Bonding and Orbital 
Overlap Explore how electrons are shared 
between atoms in a covalent bond. In vale
