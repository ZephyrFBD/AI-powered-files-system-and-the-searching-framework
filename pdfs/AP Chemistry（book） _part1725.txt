ment optimizes hydrogen bonding between molecules, with each H2O mole-
cule forming hydrogen bonds to four neighboring H2O molecules. These hydrogen 
bonds, however, create the cavities seen in the middle image of Figure 11.11. When 
ice melts, the motions of the molecules cause the structure to collapse. The hydrogen 
bonding in the liquid is more random than that in the solid but is strong enough to 
hold the molecules close together. Consequently, liquid water has a denser structure 
than ice, meaning that a given mass of water occupies a smaller volume than the same 
mass of ice.
The expansion of water upon freezing (Figure 11.12) is responsible for many phe-
nomena we take for granted. It causes icebergs to float and water pipes to burst in cold 
weather. The lower density of ice compared to liquid water also profoundly affects life on 
Earth. Because ice floats, it covers the top of the water when a lake freezes, thereby insu-
lating the water. If ice were denser than water, ice
