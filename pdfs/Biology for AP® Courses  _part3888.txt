61. Terrestrial arthropods, birds, and reptiles convert toxic
ammonia to uric acid or the closely related compound
guanine (guano). However, the conversion of ammonia to
uric acid requires more energy and is much more complex
than the conversion of ammonia to urea, or the excretion
of ammonia as performed by fish. Based on these findings,
how may the excretory system of one of the terrestrial
organisms listed above change if it evolved to spend most
of its time in water?
a.
They may evolve the ability to switch between
uric acid and direct ammonia excretion.
b.
They would further reduce their excretion of
ammonia.
c.
They may evolve the ability to excrete uric acid
without having to dissolve it in any water.
d.
They would excrete higher concentrations of
uric acid.
