B. All organisms require an input of energy from the environment, as well as the means to control the orderly
use of that energy.
1. Organisms generally convert the energy they obtain into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, the cell’s
“energy currency,” which they use to power all life processes, including biosynthesis.
2. Biochemical reactions, catalyzed by a large array of enzymes that are specific for each reaction,
control biosynthesis—the chemical reactions that produce the macromolecules of which an
organism’s cells are composed.
C. Biological molecules include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids that have a number of
important functions.
D. Water is the most abundant molecule in living organisms and possesses a variety of instrumental
properties that result from its hydrogen bonding.
E. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts to speed up biochemical reactions.
