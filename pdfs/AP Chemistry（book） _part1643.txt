of a gas 
to its molar mass: ℳ= dRT>P. We can also use the ideal-gas equation 
to solve problems involving gases as reactants or products in chemi-
cal reactions.
GAS MIXTURES AND PARTIAL PRESSURES (SECTION 10.6) In 
gas mixtures, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures 
that each gas would exert if it were present alone under the same 
conditions (Dalton’s law of partial pressures). The partial pressure of a 
component of a mixture is equal to its mole fraction times the total 
pressure: P
1 = X1P
t. The mole fraction X is the ratio of the moles of one 
component of a mixture to the total moles of all components.
