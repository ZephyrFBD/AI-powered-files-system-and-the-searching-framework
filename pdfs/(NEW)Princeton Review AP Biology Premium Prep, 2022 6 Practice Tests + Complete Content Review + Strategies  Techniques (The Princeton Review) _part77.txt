t survive well there or could not
compete with the existing bacteria.
When deposited on the external auditory canal and the plantar heel areas, it looked like the new bacteria made an
impact and were competing with the existing bacteria. The plantar heel area, in particular, seemed to be recolonized by
the bacteria or the interdigital web space.
(d) If each deposition site is pretreated with known antibiotics, explain how this would likely affect the results. (2
points)
Antibiotics destroy bacteria. If the new sites had been treated with antibiotics, this would have wiped out the
existing bacteria. If the antibiotics were still present, then they would kill the newly deposited bacteria as well. Either
way, the skin sites would be clear of the existing bacteria and ready to receive the newly deposited bacteria, like a clean
slate. This would make the results show a population more like the interdigital than the existing bacteria at those sites.
