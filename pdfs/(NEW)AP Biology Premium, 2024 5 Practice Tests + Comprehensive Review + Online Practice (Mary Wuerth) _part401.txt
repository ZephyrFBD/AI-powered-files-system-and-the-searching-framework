13. The human THY-1 gene (Thy-1 cell surface antigen) codes for a cell surface glycoprotein that is thought to
function as a tumor suppressor in certain types of cancer. In order to find possible locations of enhancer
sequences for the THY-1 gene, scientists performed a series of DNA deletion experiments. In the experiments,
different deletions were made in areas that were suspected to function as possible enhancer sequences, and the
levels of THY-1 transcription were measured after each deletion. The following diagram shows the sequences
deleted. A, B, C, D, and E represent different DNA sequences. 1, 2, and 3 represent suspected enhancer
sequences. P is the promoter of the THY-1 gene. An X represents the deletion of that portion of the DNA
sequence.
The levels of THY-1 transcription in each part of the experiment are shown in the graph.
(a) Explain the function of enhancer sequences in eukaryotic gene expression.
(b) Identify which DNA sequence (A, B, C, D, or E) was the
