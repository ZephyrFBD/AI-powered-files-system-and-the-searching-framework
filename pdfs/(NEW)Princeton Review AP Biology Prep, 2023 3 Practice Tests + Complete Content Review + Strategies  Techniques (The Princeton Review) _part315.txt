ith their centromeres intact.
The chromosomes now move to their respective poles.
Telophase I
During telophase I, the nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromosomes.
Finally, the cells undergo cytokinesis, leaving us with two daughter cells. Notice that at this point the nucleus
contains the haploid number of chromosomes, but each chromosome is a duplicated chromosome, which consists of
two chromatids.
Meiosis II
The purpose of the second meiotic division is to separate sister chromatids, and the process is virtually identical to
mitosis. Letâ€™s run through the steps of meiosis II.
During prophase II, chromosomes once again condense and become visible. In metaphase II, chromosomes move
toward the metaphase plate. This time they line up single file, not as pairs. During anaphase II, chromatids of each
chromosome split at the centromere, and each chromatid is pulled to opposite ends of the cell. At telophase II, a
nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromosomes and a total of
