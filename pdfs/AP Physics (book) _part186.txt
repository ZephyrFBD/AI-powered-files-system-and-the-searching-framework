the starting point as it did initially, but in the opposite direction (this is the
meaning of the negative sign). And, as we saw in part (a), the time is the same
up as down. Thus the motion is symmetrical about the maximum height.

The acceleration of objects such as rockets and fast airplanes is often given as
a multiple of  
For example, a plane pulling out of a dive 
(see Fig. 2–24) and undergoing 3.00 g’s would have an acceleration of
