 jumps into the hole leaves behind a new hole. Thus, 
the positive hole moves about in the lattice like a particle.* A material like this is called a 
p-type semiconductor, p signifying that the number of positive holes in the material has 
increased.
As with n-type conductivity, p-type dopant levels of only parts per million can lead 
to a millionfold increase in conductivity—but in this case, the holes in the valence band 
are doing the conduction [Figure 12.31(c)].
The junction of an n-type semiconductor with a p-type semiconductor forms the 
basis for diodes, transistors, solar cells, and other devices.
