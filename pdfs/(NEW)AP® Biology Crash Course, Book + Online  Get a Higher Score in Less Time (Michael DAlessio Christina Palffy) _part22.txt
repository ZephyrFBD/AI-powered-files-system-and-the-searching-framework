 Cohesion—ability of water molecules to stick together
2. Adhesion—ability of water to adhere to other molecules
3. Surface Tension—difficulty in breaking the surface of water
4. High Specific Heat Capacity and Thermal Conductivity—it heats up and cools down slowly

Monomers and Polymers
A. Monomers are building blocks of larger macromolecules called polymers.
B. Macromolecules are large molecules that fall into four categories: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and
nucleic acids.
C. Condensation reactions are responsible for the biosynthesis of polymers from monomers with the removal
of water. The following figure shows the condensation synthesis of a polymer:
D. Conversely, hydrolysis reactions break down polymers into their monomers with the addition of water,
and it is the reverse of the reaction shown in the figure on condensation synthesis of a polymer.

Biological Molecules
A. These biologically important elements are found in all organisms:
1. Carbon (C), hydrogen (H), an
