ry useful in determining the structure of biolog-
ically important molecules, such as the double helix structure of DNA, worked
out by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. See Fig. 25–40, and for models 
of the double helix, Figs. 16–39a and 16–40. Around 1960, the first detailed
structure of a protein molecule, myoglobin, was elucidated with the aid of X-ray
diffraction. Soon the structure of an important constituent of blood, hemoglobin,
was worked out, and since then the structures of a great many molecules have
been determined with the help of X-rays.
25–12 X-Ray Imaging and 
Computed Tomography (CT Scan)
Normal X-Ray Image
For a conventional medical or dental X-ray photograph, the X-rays emerging from
the tube (Fig. 25–36) pass through the body and are detected on photographic film,
a digital sensor, or a fluorescent screen, Fig. 25–41. The rays travel in very nearly
straight lines through the body with minimal deviation since at X-ray wavelengths
there is little diffraction or
