ation has impaired their
mitochondria, (B). (A) is incorrect because a higher rate of oxygen
consumption in mitochondria would decrease ADP levels (electrons
are transferred to oxygen when ADP is phosphorylated to make ATP).
(C) is incorrect because ADP levels would be greater when ATP is
utilized (ATP → ADP + Pi). (D) is incorrect because carbon dioxide is
released, not consumed, in cellular respiration.

In the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, light energy splits
water, releasing oxygen, and NADPH and ATP are produced. In the
light-independent reactions of photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is
reduced by NADPH and ATP to make glucose. Thus, the correct answer
is (D). (A) and (B) are incorrect because photosynthesis consumes
water and carbon dioxide and produces oxygen and glucose (6CO2 +
6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2). (C) is incorrect because the light-dependent
and light-independent reactions are switched: light-dependent
reactions produce NADPH and ATP
