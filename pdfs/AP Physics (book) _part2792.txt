FIGURE 25–15 (a) Under water, we see a blurry
image because light rays are bent much less than
in air. (b) If we wear goggles, we again have an
air–cornea interface and can see clearly.

Nearsighted eye. A nearsighted eye has near and far points
of 12 cm and 17 cm, respectively. (a) What lens power is needed for this person
to see distant objects clearly, and (b) what then will be the near point? Assume
that the lens is 2.0 cm from the eye (typical for eyeglasses).
APPROACH For a distant object
the lens must put the image at the
far point of the eye as shown in F
