30. (II) A sealed metal container contains a gas at 20.0°C and
1.00 atm. To what temperature must the gas be heated for
the pressure to double to 2.00 atm? (Ignore expansion of the
container.)
31. (II) A tire is filled with air at 15°C to a gauge pressure of
230 kPa. If the tire reaches a temperature of 38°C, what
fraction of the original air must be removed if the original
pressure of 230 kPa is to be maintained?
32. (II) If 61.5 L of oxygen at 18.0°C and an absolute pressure
of 2.45 atm are compressed to 38.8 L and at the same time
the temperature is raised to 56.0°C, what will the new pres-
sure be?
33. (II) You buy an “airtight” bag of potato chips packaged at
sea level, and take the chips on an airplane flight. When
you take the potato chi
