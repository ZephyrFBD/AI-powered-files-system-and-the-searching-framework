osis are 
the exchange of genetic material (“crossing over”) between homologous chromosomes, 
the independent assortment of the chromosomes, and the separation of alleles of the 
same gene (Figure 8). These characteristics, along with random fertilization, increase the 
genetic variability in the offspring. These mechanisms are essential to our understanding 
of genetics and evolution in sexually reproducing organisms. 
The hallmark of sexual reproduction is the great diversity seen in the gametes and in 
the offspring. Meiosis is integral to sexual reproduction. Ask your students the following 
questions before they begin the exercise: 
•  How is meiosis important to a sexually reproducing organism? 
•  What would happen if eggs and sperm were produced by mitosis instead of meiosis? 
•  How can crossing over between homologous chromosomes be detected? 
•  How do meiosis and fertilization affect genetic diversity and evolution? 
•  How do sexually reproducing organisms produce gametes
