ta Tables and Charts 
If using the gas pressure sensor to measure water loss, students might find the following 
tables useful for recording their data/results. However, it is recommended that students 
construct their own visuals, including tables and graphs, for reporting data. Although 
the computer interface will generate graphs on the screen, you may elect to have students 
draw, label, and annotate their own graph. 
You may need to explain kPa. The pascal (Pa) is a unit of pressure, and there are 1,000 
pascals in 1 kilopascal (kPa). One kPa is approximately the pressure exerted by a 10-g 
mass resting on a 1-cm2 area. If students have studied chemistry and/or physical science 
or physics, they may recognize that 101.3 kPa = 1 atm of pressure.
