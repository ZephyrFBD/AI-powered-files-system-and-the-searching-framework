Many processes that occur in nature, such as population growth, radioactive decay, heat 
diffusion, and numerous others, can be modeled by using exponential functions. 
In this section we study exponential models. 
Suppose we start with a single bacterium, which divides every hour. After one hour we 
have 2 bacteria, after two hours we have 4 bacteria, after three hours we have 8 bacteria, 
and so on. 
We see that we can model the bacteria population after t hours by f(t) = 2t. 
 
 
2.10.2 Exponential Growth (Doubling Time) 
If we start with 10 of these bacteria, then the population is modeled by f(t) =10* 2t. 
A slower-growing strain of bacteria doubles every 3 hours; in this case the population is 
modeled by f(t) =10* 2t/3. 
If the initial size of a population is n0 and the doubling time is a, then the size of the 
population at time t is 
=

where a and t are measured in the same time units (minutes, hours, days, years, and so 
on).
