onfers protection to heat stress if the 5′-UTR
contains the wild type RNA thermometer. (C) is incorrect because the
wild type and mutant Hsp70 proteins are functional in the mutant cells
at high temperature if they are synthesized. (D) is incorrect because
the RNA thermometer from a wild type cell is functional in the mutant
cells.

Since lactose is the only source of carbon, glucose levels are low. This
signals the repressor to unbind from the operator and CAP to bind to
the promoter, both of which turn on the lac operon. Hence, a single
mRNA strand containing the structural genes for lacZ, lacY, and lacA is
transcribed from the operon. The correct answer is (A).

Based on the information, the expression of Hox10 genes in mice
inhibit rib development. Since snakes possess ribs along their entire
body, Hox10 genes most likely are inactive in snakes. Thus, the correct
answer is (B). (A) is incorrect because if Hox10 genes worke
