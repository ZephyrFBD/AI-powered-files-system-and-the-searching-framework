Calculate the molarity of a solution made by dissolving 5.00 g  
of glucose 1C6H12O62 in sufficient water to form exactly 100 mL  
of solution.
 
Sample Exercise 4.12 
Calculating Molar Concentrations of Ions
What is the molar concentration of each ion present in a 0.025 M aqueous solution of calcium nitrate?
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
What is the ratio of the concentration of potassium ions to the 
concentration of carbonate ions in a 0.015 M solution of potas-
sium carbonate? (a) 1:0.015 (b) 0.015:1 (c) 1:1 (d) 1:2 (e) 2:1
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
What is the molar concentration of K+ ions in a 0.015 M solu-
tion of potassium carbonate?
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the concentration of the ionic compound 
used to make the solution and asked to determine the concentra-
tions of the ions in the solution.
Plan We can use the subscripts in the chemical formula of the 
compound to determine the relative ion concentrations.
Solve Calcium nitrate is composed of calcium ions 1Ca2+2 and
