Hasselbalch equation is an approximation, and more detailed 
calculations may need to be performed to obtain equilibrium 
concentrations.
ACID–BASE TITRATIONS (SECTION 17.3) The plot of the pH of 
an acid (or base) as a function of the volume of added base (or acid) 
is called a pH titration curve. The titration curve of a strong acid–
strong base titration exhibits a large change in pH in the imme-
diate vicinity of the equivalence point; at the equivalence point 
for such a titration pH = 7. For strong acid–weak base or weak 
acid–strong base titrations, the pH change in the vicinity of the 
equivalence point is not as large as for a strong acid–strong base 
titration, nor will the pH equal 7 at the equivalence point in these 
cases. Instead, what determines the pH at the equivalence point 
is the conjugate base or acid salt solution that results from the
