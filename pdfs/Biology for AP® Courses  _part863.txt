exokinase (Figure 7.20). This enzyme catalyzes
the phosphorylation of glucose, which helps to prepare the compound for cleavage in a later step. The presence of the
negatively charged phosphate in the molecule also prevents the sugar from leaving the cell. When hexokinase is inhibited,
glucose diffuses out of the cell and does not become a substrate for the respiration pathways in that tissue. The product of
the hexokinase reaction is glucose-6-phosphate, which accumulates when a later enzyme, phosphofructokinase, is inhibited.

Figure 7.20 The glycolysis pathway is primarily regulated at the three key enzymatic steps (1, 2, and 7) as indicated.
Note that the first two steps that are regulated occur early in the pathway and involve hydrolysis of ATP.
Phosphofructokinase is the main enzyme controlled in glycolysis. High levels of ATP, citrate, or a lower, more acidic pH
