Figure 9.15 The histological section of a foot of a 15-day-old mouse embryo, visualized using light microscopy, reveals
areas of tissue between the toes, which apoptosis will eliminate before the mouse reaches its full gestational age at 27
days. (credit: modification of work by Michal Ma√±as)
Termination of the Signal Cascade
The aberrant signaling often seen in tumor cells is proof that the termination of a signal at the appropriate time can be just
as important as the initiation of a signal. One method of stopping a specific signal is to degrade the ligand or remove it so
that it can no longer access its receptor. One reason that hydrophobic hormones like estrogen and testosterone trigger long-
lasting events is because they bind carrier proteins. These proteins allow the insoluble molecules to be soluble in blood, but
they also protect the hormones from degradation by circulating e
