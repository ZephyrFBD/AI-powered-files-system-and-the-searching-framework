n also refer to the amount of heat released
by a substance when it changes from a gas to a liquid, or from a liquid to a solid.
Thus, steam releases 
when it changes to water, and water releases
when it becomes ice. [In these cases of heat release,
when using
the 
approach, Eq. 14–3.]
The heat involved in a change of phase depends not only on the latent heat
but also on the total mass of the substance. That is,
(14;4)
where L is the latent heat of the particular process and substance, m is the mass
of the substance, and Q is the heat added or released during the phase change.
For example, when 5.00 kg of water freezes at 0°C,
of energy is released.

SOLUTION To determine the final temperature T, we apply conservation of
energy. We present both of the techniques discussed in Section 14–4.
