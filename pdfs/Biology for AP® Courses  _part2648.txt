How are photosynthates transported in plants?
Connection for AP® Courses
Information in this section applies to concepts we explored in previous chapters by connecting them to the transport of water
and solutes through a plant, showing ways that plants take up and transport materials. These concepts include the processes
of photosynthesis and cellular respiration, the chemical and physical properties of water, and the coevolution of plants with
mutualistic bacteria and fungi. The vascular system of terrestrial plants allows the efficient absorption and delivery of water
through the cells that comprise xylem, whereas phloem delivers sugars produced in photosynthesis to all parts of the plant,
including the roots for storage. The physical separation of xylem and phloem permits plants to move different nutrients
simultaneously from roots to shoots and vice versa. Nearly all plants use related mechanisms of osmoregulation, and we
will focus on the
