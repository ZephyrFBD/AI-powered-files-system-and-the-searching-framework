uter rim of a merry-go-round, and Jill
sits midway between the center and the rim. The merry-
go-round makes one complete revolution every 2 seconds.
Jill’s linear velocity is:
(a) the same as Bonnie’s.
(b) twice Bonnie’s.
(c) half of Bonnie’s.
(d) one-quarter of Bonnie’s.
(e) four times Bonnie’s.
2. An object at rest begins to rotate with a constant angular
acceleration. If this object rotates through an angle 
in
time , through what angle did it rotate in the time
(a)
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e)
3. A car speedometer that is supposed to read the linear speed
of the car uses a device that actually measures the angular
speed of the tires. If larger-diameter tires are mounted on
the car instead, how will that affect the speedometer reading?
The speedometer
(a) will still read the speed accurately.
(b) will read low.
(c) will read high.
4. The solid dot shown in Fig. 8–36 is a pivot point. The board
can rotate about the pivot. Which force shown exerts the
largest magnitude torque on the board?
4u.
