Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (D) Corepressors help the repressor protein bind to the operator. Since serine is a corepressor, its presence
would result in increased binding of the repressor protein to the operator. Choice (A) is incorrect because
repressible operons are usually anabolic, not catabolic, in function and thus they would not be involved in the
digestion of serine. Since serine functions as a corepressor, the presence of serine would reduce the expression
of the operon and would not result in increased levels of serine. Thus, choice (B) is incorrect. The presence of
the corepressor does not affect the production of the repressor protein, so choice (C) is incorrect.
2. (A) In inducible operons, the inducer molecule bi
