[If the object is beyond the focal point, as in Fig. 23–15, the image is real and
inverted: upside down—and hard to use!]
Seeing the Image; Seeing Yourself
For a person’s eye to see a sharp image, the eye must be at a place where it inter-
cepts diverging rays from points on the image, as is the case for the eye’s position
in Figs. 23–15, 23–16, and 23–17. When we look at normal objects, we always
detect rays diverging toward the eye as shown in Fig. 23–1. (Or, for very distant 
objects like stars, the rays become essentially parallel, as in Fig. 23–12.)

If you placed your eye between points O and I in Fig.23–16, for example, converging
rays from the object 
would enter your eye and the lens of your eye could no
