groups only occur in three amino acids: tyrosine, serine, and threonine. The best understood of these receptors is the
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). A typical RTK sequence follows (Figure 6-2c):
 
1. RTK receives signal. At the outer surface of the membrane, the RTK binds to a signaling molecule.
 
2. RTK forms dimer. Two RTKs associate, forming a pair (dimer).
3. RTK is activated by autophosphorylation. On the inner surface of the membrane, each of the two RTKs in the
dimer phosphorylates the other RTK using phosphate groups from ATPs. This process, called autophosphorylation,
activates the protein complex. Multiple phosphate groups can attach, each to a tyrosine amino acid.
4. Relay protein is phosphorylated. Relay proteins bind to the tyrosinephosphate domains of the RTK. The
phosphates are then transferred from the tyrosines to the relay proteins. More than one kind of protein may be
phosphorylated by a single RTK dimer and each kind of phosphorylated protein can serv
