esence of undigested material. This phase consists of
local, hormonal, and neural responses. These responses stimulate secretions and powerful contractions.
The intestinal phase begins when chyme enters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions. This phase controls the
rate of gastric emptying. In addition to gastric emptying, when chyme enters the small intestine, it triggers other hormonal
and neural events that coordinate the activities of the intestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder.
Hormonal Responses to Food
The endocrine system controls the response of the various glands in the body and the release of hormones at the appropriate
times.
One of the important factors under hormonal control is the stomach acid environment. During the gastric phase, the hormone
gastrin is secreted by G cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins. Gastrin stimulates the release of
stomach acid, or hydrochloric acid (HCl) which aids in the digestion of the proteins.
