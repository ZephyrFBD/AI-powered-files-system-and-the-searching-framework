Question 3 (continued) 
 
Identification (1 point) 
• 
Amino acid/molecular data 
 
Reasoning (1 point) 
• 
Morphology may be similar (due to convergent evolution/analogous structures) even if 
there are differences in amino acid/DNA sequences. 
• 
Molecular data (e.g. amino acid changes, DNA changes) directly show genetic make-
up/ reveal evolution. 
 
OR 
 
Identification (1 point) 
• 
Morphological data 
 
Reasoning (1 point) 
• 
Similar molecular sequences may result in different morphologies. 
• 
An example of species with similar proteins but different morphology (e.g., chimps and 
humans).
