discover new cathode and an-
ode materials that will easily accept and release lithium ions with-
out falling apart over many repeated cycles. New separator materials 
that allow for faster passage of lithium ions with less heat genera-
tion are also  
under development. Some research groups are looking 
at  
using sodium ions instead of lithium ions because sodium is far 
more  
abundant than  
lithium, although the larger size of sodium ions 
poses additional challenges. In the coming years, look for continued 
advances in battery technology based on alkali metal ions.

Separator, which separates the anode 
and the cathode but allows the passage 
of Li1 ions.
On discharge, Li1 ions migrate through the 
separator from the anode to the cathode.  
Charging reverses the migration.
