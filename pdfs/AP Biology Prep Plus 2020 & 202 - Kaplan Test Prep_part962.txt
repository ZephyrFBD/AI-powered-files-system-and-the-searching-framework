sphere (–100 MPa). Therefore, the
correct answer is (A). (B) is incorrect because as water molecules
evaporate into the air at the surface of leaves, they reduce the water
potential (create a more negative pressure) and cause the uptake of
water. (C) is incorrect because water moves down a gradient of water
potential, not up. (D) is incorrect because higher water potential in the
soil than in the roots causes water to enter the roots.

When resources are limited within a habitat, species may compete for
the nutrients. According to Gause’s law, two species that compete for
the same resource cannot coexist in the same community. When P.
aurelia and P. caudatum are grown individually, they both thrive.
However, when they are grown together, P. aurelia more eﬀiciently
uses the resources and drives P. caudatum to death. The correct
answer is (C). (A) and (D) are incorrect because P. aurelia will
outcompete P. caudatum. (B) is incorrect because P. aurelia and P.
caudatum will not grow a
