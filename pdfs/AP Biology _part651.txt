ood out of the heart. Individual cardiac muscle cells have the ability to
contract even when removed from the heart. The heart itself has its own
innate pacemaker, the sinoatrial (SA) node, which sets the timing of the
contractions of the heart. Located in the wall of the right atrium, it
generates and sends electrical signals to the atrioventricular (AV) node.
The action potential of pacemaker cells is generated by voltage-gated Ca2+
channels. From the pacemaker, impulses are sent to the bundle of His and
Purkinje fibers, which trigger the ventricles to contract. Electrical impulses
travel through the cardiac and body tissues to the skin, where they can be
detected by an electrocardiogram (EKG). The heartâ€™s pacemaker is
influenced by a variety of factors: two sets of nerves that cause it to speed
up or slow down, hormones such as adrenaline, and body temperature.
Blood pressure is lowest in the veins and highest in the arteries when the
ventricles contract. Blood pressure for all norm
