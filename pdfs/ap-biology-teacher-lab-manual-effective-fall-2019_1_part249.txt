 can be used to answer several questions. Which organisms have 
lungs? What three structures do all lizards possess? According to the cladogram, which 
structure — dry skin or hair — evolved first? 
Historically, physical structures were used to create cladograms; however, modern-
day cladistics relies more heavily on genetic evidence. Chimpanzees and humans 
share 95%+ of their DNA, which would place them closely together on a cladogram.

INVESTIGATION 3
Humans and fruit flies share approximately 60% of their DNA, which would place them 
farther apart on a cladogram. Can you draw a cladogram that depicts the evolutionary 
relationship among humans, chimpanzees, fruit flies, and mosses?
