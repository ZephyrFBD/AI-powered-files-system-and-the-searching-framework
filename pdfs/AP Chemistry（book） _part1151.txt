Give It Some Thought
The density of bromine is 1000 times larger than chlorine. What factor do you think 
plays the biggest role in this dramatic change? (a) The increased mass of a bromine 
atom. (b) The fact that bromine is a liquid and chlorine a gas. (c) The larger atomic 
radius of bromine.
The halogens have highly negative electron affinities (Figure 7.12). Thus, it is not 
surprising that the chemistry of the halogens is dominated by their tendency to gain 
electrons from other elements to form halide ions, X-. (In many equations, X is used to
