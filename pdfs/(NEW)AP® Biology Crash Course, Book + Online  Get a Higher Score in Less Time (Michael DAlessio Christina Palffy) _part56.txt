integrator.
3. A response to the stimulus has to occur. This happens by an effector that is an organ, cell, or tissue
that gets information from the integrating center and causes a change to help maintain homeostasis.
D. In multicellular organisms, cells have to work together in order for homeostasis to be maintained. This
can be done through hormones being transported from one part of the organism to another, or, in animals,
a combination of hormones and communication through the nervous system.
1. An example of maintaining homeostasis in plants involves water conservation.
i.
When soil is dry, cells in the roots act as a sensor.
ii. Plant root cells, acting as the integrator, will release a hormone called abscisic acid that travels up
to leaves.
iii. This causes guard cells to close water-losing holes called stomata to conserve water. The action of
the root cells is to release abscisic acid, and the response is the closing of the stomata, which are
the effectors.
