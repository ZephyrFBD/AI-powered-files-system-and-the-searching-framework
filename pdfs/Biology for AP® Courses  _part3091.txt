brain regions that correlate with specific behavioral tasks. These techniques, and others, have given great insight into the
functions of different brain regions but have also showed that any given brain area can be involved in more than one
behavior or process, and any given behavior or process generally involves neurons in multiple brain areas. That being said,
each hemisphere of the mammalian cerebral cortex can be broken down into four functionally and spatially defined lobes:
frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. Figure 26.21 illustrates these four lobes of the human cerebral cortex.

Figure 26.21 The human cerebral cortex includes the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.
The frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain, over the eyes. This lobe contains the olfactory bulb, which processes
smells. The front
