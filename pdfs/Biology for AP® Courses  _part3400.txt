ich controls the release of T3 and T4 from the thyroid gland. Iodine is necessary in the production of thyroid
hormone, and the lack of iodine can lead to a condition called goiter.
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is produced by the parathyroid glands in response to low blood Ca2+ levels. The parafollicular
cells of the thyroid produce calcitonin, which reduces blood Ca2+ levels. Growth hormone (GH) is produced by the
anterior pituitary and controls the growth rate of muscle and bone. GH action is indirectly mediated by insulin-like growth
factors (IGFs). Short-term stress causes the hypothalamus to trigger the adrenal medulla to release epinephrine and
norepinephrine, which trigger the fight or flight response. Long-term stress causes the hypothalamus to trigger the anterior
pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which causes the release of corticosteroids, glucocorticoids, and
mineralocorticoids, from the adrenal cortex.
