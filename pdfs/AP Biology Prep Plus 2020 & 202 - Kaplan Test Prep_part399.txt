ess. In this
case, the electrons that enter photosystem I are used to produce NADPH.
Cyclic Photophosphorylation
So far, we have not addressed the mechanism used to produce ATP
during photosynthesis. As the electrons work their way through the
electron transport chains, protons are pumped out of the stroma and into
the interior of the thylakoid membranes, creating a proton gradient. This
electron transport chain-generated proton gradient is similar to the pH
gradient created in mitochondria during aerobic respiration and is used
in the same way to produce ATP. Protons flow down this gradient back
out into the stroma through an ATP synthase to produce ATP, similar once
again to mitochondria. The NADPH and ATP produced during the light
reactions are used to complete photosynthesis in the Calvin cycle;
NADPH and ATP supply the reducing power and energy necessary to
make sugars from carbon dioxide.
The oxygen produced in the light reactions is released from the plant as a
byproduct of phot
