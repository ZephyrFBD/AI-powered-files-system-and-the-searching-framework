dicators can be used to measure pH. An acidâ€“base 
indicator is a colored substance that can exist in either an acid or a base form. The two 
forms have different colors. Thus, the indicator has one color at lower pH and another at 
higher pH. If you know the pH at which the indicator turns from one form to the other, 
you can determine whether a solution has a higher or lower pH than this value. Litmus, 
for example, changes color in the vicinity of pH 7. The color change, however, is not very 
sharp. Red litmus indicates a pH of about 5 or lower, and blue litmus indicates a pH of 
about 8 or higher.
Some common indicators are listed in Figure 16.8. The chart tells us, for instance, 
that methyl red changes color over the pH interval from about 4.5 to 6.0. Below pH 
4.5 it is in the acid form, which is red. In the interval between 4.5 and 6.0, it is grad-
ually converted to its basic form, which is yellow. Once the pH rises above 6 the con-
version is complete, and the solution is yell
