30. (II) Estimate the speed of a galaxy, and its distance from us,
if the wavelength for the hydrogen line at 434 nm is meas-
ured on Earth as being 610 nm.
31. (II) Radiotelescopes are designed to observe 21-cm waves
emitted by atomic hydrogen gas. A signal from a distant
radio-emitting galaxy is found to have a wavelength that is
0.10 cm longer than the normal 21-cm wavelength. Esti-
mate the distance to this galaxy.
