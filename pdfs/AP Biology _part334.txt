s derived from membranes of host cells, cloaks the
capsid, and aids the virus in infecting the host. Each type of virus can
infect only one specific cell type because it gains entrance into a cell by
binding to specific receptors on the cell surface. For example, the virus
that causes colds in humans infects only the membranes of the respiratory
system, and the virus that causes AIDS infects only one type of white
blood cell. In addition, one virus can usually only infect one species. The
range of organisms that a virus can attack is referred to as the host range
of the virus. A sudden emergence of a new viral disease that affects
humans, such as AIDS or H1N1, may result from a mutation in the virus
that expands its host range.
Bacteriophagesâ€”Also known as phage viruses, bacteriophages are
viruses that infect bacteria. They are the most complex and best
understood viruses. The bacteriophage can reproduce in two ways.
In the lytic cycle, the phage enters a host cell, takes control of
th
