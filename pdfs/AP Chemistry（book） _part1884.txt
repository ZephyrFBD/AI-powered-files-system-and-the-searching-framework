metals are similar. The electron configuration of a nickel atom is 3Ar44s23d8, as shown 
on the left side of the figure. The energy bands that form from each of these orbitals 
are shown on the right side. The 4s, 4p, and 3d orbitals are treated independently, each 
giving rise to a band of molecular orbitals. In practice, these overlapping bands are 
not completely independent of each other, but for our purposes this simplification is 
reasonable.
The 4s, 4p, and 3d bands differ from one another in the energy range they span (rep-
resented by the heights of the rectangles on the right side of Figure 12.23) and in the 
number of electrons they can hold (
