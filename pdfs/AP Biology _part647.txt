ter to form carbonic acid.
This reaction is catalyzed by carbonic acid anhydrase found in red blood
cells. Then carbonic acid dissociates into a bicarbonate ion and a proton.
The protons can be given up into the plasma, which lowers the blood pH,
or taken up by the bicarbonate ion, which raises the blood pH. Here is the
equation:
CO2+H2Ocarbon dioxide + water↔H2CO3carbonic acid↔HCO3−
+H+bicarbonate ion + proton
STUDY TIP
CO2 is carried in the plasma. O2 is carried by red blood cells.
CIRCULATION IN DIFFERENT ANIMALS
Primitive animals like the sponge and the hydra have no circulatory
systems. All their cells are in direct contact with the environment, and such
a system is unnecessary. The earthworm has a closed circulatory system
where blood is pumped by the heart through arteries, veins, and capillaries.
Oxygen is carried by hemoglobin that is dissolved in the blood. The
grasshopper, as a representative animal of the arthropods, has an open
circulatory system. After blood is pumped by
