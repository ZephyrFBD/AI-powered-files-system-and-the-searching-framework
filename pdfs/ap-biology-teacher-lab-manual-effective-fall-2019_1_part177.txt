nts are selected, that will generate a 
selected parent stock of about 12–15 plants — an adequate number to produce the seed 
for the next generation. 
Your students will need a magnifier to study trichomes. Don’t be surprised if many 
plants have few or no hairs. The hairs are often more visible if backlit and held against 
a dark background. Help your students develop a system to keep track of their counts. 
Somehow they will need to mark each individual plant. One possible method is to record 
the number of trichomes on a small plastic stake for each plant. Students record the 
number of hairs on a stake and place it near the appropriate plant. (Stakes can be created 
by cutting a plastic milk jug into 1 cm x 10 cm strips.) 
As an instructor, you might consider utilizing Fast Plant seed stock C1-122 for this 
investigation. This stock offers a unique advantage in addition to expressing some 
variation in hairiness. That is, it is heterozygous for two Mendelian traits, green/ 
light
