that are located just below and posterior to the
liver in the peritoneal cavity. The adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the suprarenal glands. Kidneys
filter blood and purify it. All the blood in the human body is filtered many times a day by the kidneys; these organs use
up almost 25 percent of the oxygen absorbed through the lungs to perform this function. Oxygen allows the kidney cells
to efficiently manufacture chemical energy in the form of ATP through aerobic respiration. The filtrate coming out of the
kidneys is called urine.

Kidney Structure
Externally, the kidneys are surrounded by three layers, illustrated in Figure 32.6. The outermost layer is a tough connective
tissue layer called the renal fascia. The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule, which helps anchor the kidneys
