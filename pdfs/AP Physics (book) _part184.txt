known to us—the acceleration is not g. We consider only the time when
the ball is in the air and the acceleration is equal to g.
Every quadratic equation (where the variable is squared) mathematically
produces two solutions. In physics, sometimes only one solution corresponds to
the real situation, as in Example 2–8, in which case we ignore the “unphysical”
solution. But in Example 2–13, both solutions to our equation in 
are physi-
cally meaningful:
and t = 3.06 s.

An object thrown into the air leaves
the thrower’s hand at A, reaches its
maximum height at B, and returns 
to the original position at C.

Ball thrown upward, III. Let us consider again the ball
thrown upward of Examples 2–12 and 2–13, and make more calculations. Calculate
(a) how much time it takes for the ball to reach the maximum height (point B in
Fig. 2–23), and (b) the velocity of the ball
