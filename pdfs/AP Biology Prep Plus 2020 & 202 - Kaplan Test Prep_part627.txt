 so that there is an exact duplicate of each
original chromosome linked by a centromere to sister chromatids. There
are now two copies of the B allele and two copies of the b allele.
AÈ‡er the cell undergoes complete meiosis, the original cell with 2N
chromosomes has divided into four daughter cells, each with 1N
chromosomes. The daughter cells are four gametes, two with the B allele
and two with the b allele. Because the original animal cell had both a B
allele and a b allele, it can produce gametes with alleles for either blue or
green eye color. This occurs in all individuals of the same species. An
individual with the recessive green eye color (its genotype is bb) can only
produce gametes with b alleles. When an organism has two of the same
alleles (e.g., BB or bb), it is called homozygous for that gene. If both
alleles are the dominant allele, the genotype is called homozygous
dominant. If both alleles are recessive, the genotype is called
homozygous recessive. If the organism has
