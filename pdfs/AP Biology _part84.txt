urface of the membrane. Cholesterol molecules are
embedded in the interior of the bilayer to stabilize the membrane. The
average membrane has the consistency of olive oil and is about 40 percent
lipid and 60 percent protein. Phospholipids move along the plane of the
membrane rapidly. Some proteins are kept in place by attachment to the
cytoskeleton, while others drift slowly. Extending from the external
surface of the plasma membrane are glycolipids (carbohydrates covalently
bonded to lipids) and glycoproteins (carbohydrates covalently bonded to
proteins). Both structures may serve as signaling molecules that
distinguish one cell type from another. Glycoproteins on the surface of red
blood cells are responsible for ABO and Rh blood types; see Figure 3.8.
