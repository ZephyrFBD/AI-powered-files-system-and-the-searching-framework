whether the sperm carries an X or a Y sex chromosome determines
the sex of the child, that it is irrelevant to the question here. (EVO-2
& IST-1)
(B) Since A and B are not linked, they assort independently. To find
the probability of two independent events happening, multiply the
chance of one happening by the chance of the other happening.
(SYI-3 & SP 5)
(D) You can eliminate choice A because all the offspring would
show only the dominant traits. You can eliminate choice B because
the parents could not produce any offspring showing the recessive
coat color. You can eliminate choice C because that would produce
offspring in a 9:3:3:1 ratio—a dihybrid cross, which is not a choice.
That leaves choice D. Of the choices, choice D is the best one to
produce the offspring described. The parents could also be SS Bb ×
SS Bb. (IST-1 & SP 5)
(A) Examples of polygenic inheritance in humans are genes for skin
color and height. (SYI-3)
(D) The gene for Huntington’s disease (HD) is fa
