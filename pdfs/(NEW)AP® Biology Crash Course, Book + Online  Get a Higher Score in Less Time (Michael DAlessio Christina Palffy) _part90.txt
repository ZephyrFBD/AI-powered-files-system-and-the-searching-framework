ormed” the rough
cells into smooth cells that killed the mouse. The transforming agent was DNA.
B. Hershey-Chase Experiment
1. Worked with T2 bacteriophage or a virus that infects bacteria.
2. Bacteriophage were radioactively labeled with P32 (DNA) or S35 (protein coat of bacteriophage).
3. When separate experiments were completed, it was found that bacteria contain the radioactively
labeled P32 DNA of the bacteriophage.
4. Interpretation of the experiment—bacteriophage injected their DNA into the host bacterium to
produce progeny phage, indicating DNA as the genetic material.
C. Watson and Crick
1. James Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin, and Maurice Wilkins contributed to constructing the
double helical model of DNA.
2. X-ray crystallography—a technique used to measure the shapes of molecules—was contributed by
Franklin and Wilkins to determine that DNA was a double helix.
3. Watson and Crick used this and other data to construct a three-dimensional model.
