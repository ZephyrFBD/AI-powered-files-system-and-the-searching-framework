h as having brown hair and brown eyes, then you could
have both occur at the same time. If you are trying to determine the likelihood of EITHER occurring but NOT
BOTH, then you must calculate using the sum rule (odds of either occurring) and the product rule (odds of both
occurring). Then, take the result using the product rule and subtract it from the result when using the sum rule since
you want the odds of either occurring but not both.
HYPOTHESIS TESTING
t-test and p-values
Many experiments involve comparing two datasets or two groups, and a t-test can be used to calculate whether the
means of two groups are significantly different from each other. This test is most often applied to datasets that are
normally distributed. A p-value equal to or below 0.05 is considered significant in most biology-related fields. T-test
calculations involve comparing each data point to the groupâ€™s mean and also take standard deviation and sample size
into consideration.
