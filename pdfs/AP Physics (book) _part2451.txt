n this range are used to transmit radio and TV 
signals. Electromagnetic waves, or EM radiation as we sometimes call it, have 
been produced or detected over a wide range of frequencies. They are usually 
categorized as shown in Fig.22–8, which is known as the electromagnetic spectrum.

Radio waves and microwaves can be produced in the laboratory using elec-
tronic equipment (Fig. 22–5). Higher-frequency waves are very difficult to produce
electronically. These and other types of EM waves are produced in natural processes,
as emission from atoms, molecules, and nuclei (more on this later). EM waves can be
produced by the acceleration of electrons or other charged particles, such as 
electrons in the antenna of Fig. 22–5. X-rays have very short wavelengths 
(and very high frequencies), and they are produced (Chapters 2
