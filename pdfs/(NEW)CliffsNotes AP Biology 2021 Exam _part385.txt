amplification refers to a laboratory process, such as PCR, that generates multiple copies of DNA.
Answer choice A is a description of conjugation, which, together with mutation, transformation, and transduction,
are naturally occurring processes that can introduce genetic variation into the genome of bacteria.
21. C. Viruses consist of a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein coat. Some viruses contain an
envelope made from lipids or glycoproteins obtained from the membranes of their hosts, but they do not have the
phospholipid bilayer membrane typical of cells.
22. D. Introns are intervening sequences in the mRNA that are cleaved from the mRNA by snRNPs before export to
the cytoplasm and subsequent translation.
23. A. Operons are DNA segments that include a promoter region, an operator region, and a series of structural
genes. Together with a regulatory gene lying outside the operon, the three parts of an operon work collectively to
control transcription, which results in t
