is rapae) eggs in order to study the energy dynamics of a model ecosystem. On December 10th, the
terrarium is placed in the classroom under a light source attached to a timer so that the terrarium will be
exposed to 12 hours of light each day. On December 17th, winter break starts, and the terrarium is left
unattended under the light source. Unfortunately, when school reopens two weeks later, it is discovered that
there was a power outage at the school that started on December 19th, and no light was provided to the
terrarium from December 19th through January 3rd.
(a) Describe the function of the light source in this experiment.
(b) Explain how plants capture light energy.
(c) Predict what the terrarium might look like on January 3rd.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
