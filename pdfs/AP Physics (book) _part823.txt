†Note that the units for torque are the same as those for energy. We write the unit for torque here as
(in SI) to distinguish it from energy 
because the two quantities are very different. The
special name joule
is used only for energy (and for work), never for torque.

FIGURE 8;14 Example 8–8.
Biceps torque. The biceps muscle exerts a vertical force on
the lower arm, bent as shown in Figs. 8–14a and b. For each case, calculate the
torque about the axis of rotation through the elbow joint, assuming the muscle
is attached 5.0 cm from the elbow as shown.
APPROACH The force is given,
