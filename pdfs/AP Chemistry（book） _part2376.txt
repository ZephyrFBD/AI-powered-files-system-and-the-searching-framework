 naval blockade of South America cut 
off this supply. However, by using the Haber reaction to fix nitrogen 
from air, Germany was able to continue to produce explosives. Ex-
perts have estimated that World War I would have ended perhaps a 
year earlier had it not been for the Haber process.
From these unhappy beginnings as a major factor in interna-
tional warfare, the Haber process has become the world’s principal 
source of fixed nitrogen. The same process that prolonged World 
War I has enabled the manufacture of fertilizers that have increased 
crop yields, thereby saving millions of people from starvation. About 
 
40 billion pounds of ammonia are manufactured annually in the 
United States, mostly by the Haber process. The ammonia can be ap-
plied directly to the soil, or it can be converted into ammonium salts 
that are also used as fertilizers.
Haber was a patriotic German who gave enthusiastic support 
to his nation’s war effort. He served as chief of Germany’s Chemical
