indicate 
a change from the liquid to the gas phase. However, if the vapor pressure inside
the bubbles is less than the external pressure, the bubbles immediately are crushed.
As the temperature is increased, the saturated vapor pressure inside a bubble
eventually becomes equal to or exceeds the external air pressure. The bubble will
then not collapse but can rise to the surface. Boiling has then begun. A liquid boils
when its saturated vapor pressure equals the external pressure. This occurs for
water at a pressure of 1 atm (760 torr) at 100°C, as can be seen from Table 13–3.
The boiling point of a liquid depends on the external pressure. At high ele-
vations, the boiling point of water is somewhat less than at sea level because the 
air pressure is less up there. For example, on the summit of Mt. Everest (8850 m)
the air pressure is about one-third of what it is at sea level, and from Table 13–3
we can see that water will boil at about 70°C. Cooking food by boiling takes
longer at hi
