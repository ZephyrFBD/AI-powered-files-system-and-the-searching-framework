f light,
and to exhibit all the characteristics of light such as reflection, refraction, and
interference. The only difference was that they were not visible. Hertz’s experiment
was a strong confirmation of Maxwell’s theory.
The wavelengths of visible light were measured in the first decade of the nine-
teenth century, long before anyone imagined that light was an electromagnetic
wave. The wavelengths were found to lie between
and 
or 
to 
The frequencies of visible light can be
found using Eq. 11–12, which we rewrite here:
(22;4)
where f and are the frequency and wavelength, respectively, of the wave. Here,
c is the speed of light,
it gets the special symbol c because of its
universality for all EM waves in free space. Equation 22–4 tells us that the 
frequencies of visible light are between 
and
(Recall
that
)
But visible light is only one kind of EM wave. As we have seen, Hertz 
produced EM waves of much lower frequency, about 
These are now called
radio waves, because frequencies i
