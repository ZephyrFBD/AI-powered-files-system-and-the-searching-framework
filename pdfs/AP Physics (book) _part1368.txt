one of the original Doppler experiments, a tuba was
played at a frequency of 75 Hz on a moving flat train car,
and a second identical tuba played the same tone while at
rest in the railway station. What beat frequency was heard
in the station if the train car approached the station at a
speed of 
61. (II) A wave on the ocean surface with wavelength 44 m travels
east at a speed of 
relative to the ocean floor. If, on
this stretch of ocean, a powerboat is moving at 
(rela-
tive to the ocean floor), how often does the boat encounter
a wave crest, if the boat is traveling (a) west, and (b) east?

of 9500 m passes directly over an observer on the ground.
Where will the plane be relative to the observer when the
latter hears the sonic boom? (See Fig. 12–39.)
