10.99  A 15.0-L tank is filled with helium gas at a pressure of 
1.00 * 102 atm. How many balloons (each 2.00 L) can be 
inflated to a pressure of 1.00 atm, assuming that the tem-
perature remains constant and that the tank cannot be 
emptied below 1.00 atm?

Carbon dioxide, which is recognized as the major contrib-
utor to global warming as a “greenhouse gas,” is formed 
when fossil fuels are combusted, as in electrical power 
plants fueled by coal, oil, or natural
