. The low-spin 3Co(CN)643- ion has a 
strong-field ligand and so a large ∆ value. 
Because 3CoF643- has unpaired electrons 
it is paramagnetic, while 3Co(CN)643- is 
diamagnetic.

Figure 23.32 shows that the crystal-field splitting energy ∆ is much larger in the 
3Co(CN)643 -  complex. In this case, the spin-pairing energy is smaller than ∆, so the 
 
lowest-energy arrangement is to place all six electrons in the t2 orbitals.
The 3CoF643 -  complex is a high-spin complex; that is, the electrons are arranged 
so that they remain unpaired as much as possible. The 3Co(CN)643 -  ion is a low-spin 
complex; that is, the electrons are arranged so that they remain paired as much as pos-
sible while still following Hund’s rule. These two electronic arrangements can be readily 
distinguished by measuring the magnetic properties of the complex. Experiments show 
that 3CoF643 - has four unpaire
