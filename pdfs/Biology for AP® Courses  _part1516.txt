The Watson and Crick model suggested a way in which DNA could be replicated during cell division. Basically, the
two strands unwind and separate where the hydrogen bonds connect the nucleotides. Each parental strand then serves as
a template for a new, complementary daughter strand. Replication is said to be semi-conservative because the original
information encoded in each parental strand is conserved (kept) in the daughter molecules. Thus, a newly replicated
molecule of DNA consists of one “old” strand and one “new” strand. Meselson and Stahl used density differences in
nitrogen isotopes to investigate replication, and their experiments supported the semi-conservative model. However, the
process of replication is more complex than their model’s simple description.
