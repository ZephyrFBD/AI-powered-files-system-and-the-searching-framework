s conformation so that molecules can be brought into and out
of the cell against their concentration gradients. These ATPase pumps are
found in every membrane of cells, and they are extremely important in
the maintenance of unequal concentrations of certain ions across the
lipid bilayer—something essential for processes like nerve signal
conduction.
A commonly cited example of active transport is the Na+-K+ ATPase
membrane pump, whose conformational change uses the energy of ATP
breakdown to pull 2 K+ (potassium) ions into a cell while kicking out 3 Na+
(sodium) ions at the same time. This transport of molecules in opposite
directions is known as antiport, and it can be contrasted with pumps that
pull two diﬀerent molecules in the same direction (symport). Because the
pump, which is present in all cell membranes, pumps out three positive
charges for every two it brings in, the inside of the cell remains negatively
charged compared with the outside of the cell under normal conditions.
