nds to hemoglobin preferentially over oxygen. As a result, oxygen cannot bind to hemoglobin, so very little oxygen
is transported through the body (Figure 30.22). Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas and is therefore difficult to
detect. It is produced by gas-powered vehicles and tools. Carbon monoxide can cause headaches, confusion, and nausea;
long-term exposure can cause brain damage or death. Administering 100 percent (pure) oxygen is the usual treatment for
carbon monoxide poisoning. Administration of pure oxygen speeds up the separation of carbon monoxide from hemoglobin.

Figure 30.22 As percent CO increases, the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin decreases.
Think About It
How does the administration of 100 percent oxygen save a patient from carbon monoxide poisoning? Why wouldnâ€™t
giving carbon dioxide work?
