4. All living organisms contain genetic information that provides several
functions inherent to the individual organism and to the perpetuation of its
species. The frequency of two alleles, A and a (for which A is dominant and a
is recessive) are shown below for an original population and aȇer a random
event.
Describe one example of genetic driȇ.
(a)
Explain why a new species formed from genetic driȇ may not be well
adapted to survive in its environment.
(b)
The individuals from the random event reproduce and form a new
population. Based on the data, predict the allele frequencies for the new
population.
(c)
Justify your prediction.
(d)
5. In a long-term project studying the interactions of several species of
animals on an isolated island, scientists counted the number of individuals
of each species visiti
