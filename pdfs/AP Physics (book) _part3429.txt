to four families, depending on whether the mass
numbers have the form 4n,
or 
where n is an integer. Justify this statement and show that
for a nuclide in any family, all its daughters will be in the
same family.
4n + 3,
4n + 1,  4n + 2,
1. Describe in detail why we think there is a strong nuclear
force.
2. (a) Under what circumstances could a fermium nucleus
decay into an einsteinium nucleus? (b) What about the
reverse, an Es nucleus decaying into Fm?
3. Using the uncertainty principle and the radius of a nucleus,
estimate the minimum possible kinetic energy of a nucleon
in, say, iron. Ignore relativistic corrections. [Hint: A particle
can have a momentum at least as large as its momentum
uncertainty.]
4. In Fig. 30â€“17, a nucleus decays and emits a particle that
enters a region with a uniform magnetic field of 0.012 T
directed into the page. The path of the detected particle is
shown. (a) What type of radioactive decay is this? (b) If
the radius of the circular arc is 4.7 mm, what is
