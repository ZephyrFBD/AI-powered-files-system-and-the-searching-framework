component (approximately 
60 to 80%) of olive oil is oleic acid, cis@CH31CH227CH“CH1CH227COOH. Oleic acid 
is an example of a monounsaturated fatty acid, meaning it has only one carbon–carbon 
double bond in the chain. In contrast, polyunsaturated fatty acids have more than one 
 
carbon–carbon double bond in the chain.
For humans, trans fats are not nutritionally required, which is why some govern-
ments are moving to ban them in foods. How, then, do trans fats end up in our food? The 
process that converts unsaturated fats (such as oils) into saturated fats (such as shorten-
ing) is hydrogenation. 
 (Section 24.3) The by-products of this hydrogenation process 
include trans fats.
Some of the fatty acids essential for human health must be available in our diets 
because our metabolism cannot synthesize them. These essential fatty acids are ones 
that have the carbon–carbon double bonds either three carbons or six carbons away from 
the ¬CH3 end of the chain. These are called omega-3 a
