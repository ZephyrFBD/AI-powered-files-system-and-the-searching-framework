shows floral phenotypes in a small garden in an isolated greenhouse, where the dominant phenotypes are the most
plentiful and researchers assume the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

47. A cross is performed between one nettle that is known to be heterozygous for both traits and a nettle that is
pink and ruffled. Which of the following would lead researchers to believe the traits are linked?
(A) Several white flowers are identified with ruffled petals.
(B) Nearly all white fl
