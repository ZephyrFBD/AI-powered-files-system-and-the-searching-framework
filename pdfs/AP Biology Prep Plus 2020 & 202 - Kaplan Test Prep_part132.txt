DNA genome are read (transcribed) to make RNA, which is processed in
the nucleus before it is exported to the cytoplasm, where the RNA is read
in turn (translated) to make proteins. The basic information flow of the
cell is DNA to RNA to protein. The DNA genome is replicated in the
nucleus when the cell divides. Other metabolic activities, such as energy

production, are excluded from the nucleus. The structure and function of
the eukaryotic genome will be presented later in more detail.
The dense structure within the nucleus where ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
synthesis occurs is known as the nucleolus. The nucleolus is not
surrounded by a membrane but is the site of assembly of ribosomal
subunits from RNA and protein components. Aȇer assembly, the
ribosomal subunits are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to
carry out protein synthesis.
RIBOSOMES
Ribosomes are not organelles but are large, complex structures in the
cytoplasm that are involve
