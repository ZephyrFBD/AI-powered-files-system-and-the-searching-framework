xpanding universe, Einstein discarded his cosmological constant as no
longer needed 
But today, measurements are consistent with dark energy
being due to a nonzero cosmological constant, although further measurements are
needed to see subtle differences among theories.
There is increasing evidence that the effects of some form of dark energy 
are very real. Observations of the CMB, supernovae, and large-scale structure
(Section 33–10) agree well with theories and computer models when they input
dark energy as providing about 70% of the mass–energy in the universe, and when
the total mass–energy density equals the critical density 
Today’s best estimate of how the mass–energy in the universe is distributed
is approximately (see also Fig. 33–33):
70% dark energy
30% matter, subject to the known gravitational force.
Of this 30%, about
25% is dark matter
5% is baryons (what atoms are made of); of this 5% only 
is readily
visible matter—stars and galaxies (that is, 0.5% of the total); the o
