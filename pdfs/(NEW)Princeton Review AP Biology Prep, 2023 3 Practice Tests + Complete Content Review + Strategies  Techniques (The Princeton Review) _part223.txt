enzyme and substrate will also determine the speed of the reaction.
Temperature
The rate of a reaction increases with increasing temperature, up to a point, because an increase in the temperature of
a reaction increases the frequency of collisions among the molecules. But too much heat can damage an enzyme. If a
reaction is conducted at an excessively high temperature (above 42°C), the enzyme loses its three-dimensional shape
and becomes inactivated. Enzymes damaged by heat and deprived of their ability to catalyze reactions are said to be
denatured, or disrupted. In some cases, however, enzyme denaturation is reversible if the original optimal
environmental conditions of the enzyme are restored. This allows the enzyme to regain its activity and function.
Break Down Words
To denature is to "un-nature" something, to change its nature, or to remove the
characteristics that make it unique. Without proper and special folding, a
protein loses its nature.
Here’s one thing to remember:
