1. This Chapter gives two ways to calculate the thermal expan-
sion of a gas at a constant pressure of 1.0 atm. Use both
methods to calculate the volume change of 1000 L of an
ideal gas as it goes from 
to 0°C and from 0°C to
100°C. Why are the answers different?
2. A scuba tank when fully charged has a pressure of 180 atm at
18°C. The volume of the tank is 11.3 L. (a) What would the
volume of the air be at 1.00 atm and at the same tempera-
ture? (b) Before entering the water, a person consumes 2.0 L
of air in each breath, and breathes 12 times a minute. At this
rate, how long would the tank last? (c) At a depth of 23.0 m
in sea water at a temperature of 10°C, how long would the
same tank last assuming th
