building blocks of molecules found in the universe—air, soil, water, rocks . . . and also
the cells of all living organisms. In this model of an organic molecule, the atoms of carbon (black), hydrogen (white),
nitrogen (blue), oxygen (red), and sulfur (yellow) are shown in proportional atomic size. The silver rods indicate
chemical bonds. (credit: modification of work by Christian Guthier)

Introduction
All matter, including living things, is made up of various combinations of elements. Some of the most abundant elements
in living organisms include carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus. These elements form the major
biological molecules—nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids—that are the fundamental components of living
matter. Biologists study these important molecules to understand their unique structures which determine their specialized
functions.
