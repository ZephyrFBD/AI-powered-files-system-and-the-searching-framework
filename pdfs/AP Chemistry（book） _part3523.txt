as refrigerants, lubricants, and plastics. Teflon® (Figure 22.9) is a polymeric fluorocarbon 
noted for its high thermal stability and lack of chemical reactivity.
Chlorine is by far the most commercially important halogen. About half of the chlo-
rine is used to manufacture chlorine-containing organic compounds, such as the vinyl 
chloride 1C2H3Cl2 used in making polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics. 
 (Section 12.8) 
Much of the remainder is used as a bleaching agent in the paper and textile industries.
When Cl2 dissolves in cold dilute base, it converts into Cl -  and hypochlorite, ClO -:
 
Cl21aq2 + 2 OH-1aq2 ∆Cl-1aq2 + ClO-1aq2 + H2O1l2 
[22.18]
Sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) is the active ingredient in many liquid bleaches. Chlorine 
is also used in water treatment to oxidize and thereby destroy bacteria.
