†Some readers may say: “Tell us the facts as we know them today, and don’t bother us with the histor-
ical background and its outmoded theories.” Such an approach would ignore the creative aspect of
science and thus give a false impression of how science develops. Moreover, it is not really possible to
understand today’s view of the atom without insight into the concepts that led to it.
expected from the plum-pudding model that the alpha particles would not be
deflected significantly because electrons are so much lighter than alpha particles,
and the alpha particles should not have encountered any massive concentration
of positive charge to strongly repel them. The experimental results compl
