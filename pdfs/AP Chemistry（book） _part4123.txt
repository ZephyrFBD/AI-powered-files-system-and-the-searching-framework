 
20.69 (a) The compartment with 3Zn2 +4 = 1.00 * 10-2 M is the 
anode. (b) E° = 0 (c) E = 0.0668 V (d) In the anode compartment 
3Zn2 +4 increases; in the cathode compartment 3Zn2 +4 decreases. 
20.71 E° = 0.76 V, pH = 1.6 20.73 (a) 464 g PbO2 (b) 3.74 * 105 C 
of charge transferred 20.75 (a) The anode (b) E° = 3.50 V (c) The emf 
of the battery, 3.5 V, is exactly the standard cell potential calculated 
as acid-base reactions can be viewed as proton-transfer reactions. 
Oxidizing agents are themselves reduced; they gain electrons. A 
strong oxidizing agent would be analogous to a strong base. 20.3 
(a) The process represents oxidation. (b) The electrode is the anode.  
(c) When a neutral atom loses a valence electron, the radius of the 
resulting cation is smaller than the radius of the neutral atom.  
20.7 (a) The sign of ∆G° is positive. (b) The equilibrium constant 
is less than one. (c) No. An electrochemical cell based on this reac-
tion cannot accomplish work on its surroundings
