ause animals do not metabolize carbon
dioxide; rather, CO2 is a waste product of the metabolism of glucose
and other food sources. (C) is incorrect because learning plays a
relatively small role in the ability of simple animals like fish to survive.
(D) is incorrect because no data is provided about temperature, so
there is no basis for concluding that a cooler environment would help
the cod to survive.

RNA is capable of acting as both an information molecule, like DNA,
and a catalyst, like protein. Therefore, it seems reasonable to believe
that RNA performed these functions in early living things, making (B)
correct. DNA and protein evolved later as specialized molecules that
were better than RNA at their functions. However, neither DNA nor
protein could carry out both functions. (A) should be rejected because
the phrase “proved beyond any doubt” is an unscientific statement.
Although this experiment demonstrated that it was possible to
engineer self-repli
