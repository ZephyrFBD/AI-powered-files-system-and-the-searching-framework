mpartmentalized in different areas of the cell. Before turning to organelles, let’s first
examine two important components of the cell: the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm.

Figure 4.8 These figures show the major organelles and other cell components of (a) a typical animal cell
and (b) a typical eukaryotic plant cell. The plant cell has a cell wall, chloroplasts, plastids, and a central
vacuole—structures not found in animal cells. Most plant cells do not have lysosomes or centrosomes.
If the nucleolus were not able to carry out its function, what other cellular organelles would be affected?
a.
The structure of endoplasmic reticulum would not form.
b.
The function of lysosomes would be hindered, as hydrolases are formed by nucleolus.
c.
The free ribosomes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which contains ribosomes, would not form.
