5. A researcher examines the structure of a protein that has been
extracted from the membrane of a eukaryotic cell. She finds that
the surface of one domain of the protein consists entirely of
hydrophobic amino acids, whereas the surface of another domain
consists entirely of hydrophilic amino acids. What can she most
reasonably conclude about this protein?
Answers to this quiz can be found at the end of this chapter.
This protein is probably found deep within the cell and must
have been mixed with the membrane material in error during
sample preparation.
(A)
The protein is probably found embedded completely within
the phospholipid bilayer.
(B)
The protein is probably bound to the outer surface of the cell
membrane, facing the extra cellular matrix.
(C)
The protein is probably embedded in the cell membrane with
portions extending either into the extracellular matrix or the
cytoplasm.
(D)
