 refraction. There is absorption (and scattering), how-
ever; and the difference in absorption by different structures in the body is what
gives rise to the image produced by the transmitted rays. The less the absorption,
the greater the transmission and the darker the film. The image is, in a sense,
a “shadow” of what the rays have passed through. The X-ray image is not pro-
duced by focusing rays with lenses as for the instruments discussed earlier in 
this Chapter.
Tomography Images (CT)
In conventional X-ray images, a body’s thickness is projected onto film or a
sensor; structures overlap and in many cases are difficult to distinguish. In the 1970s,
a revolutionary X-ray technique was developed called computed tomography (CT),
which produces an image of a slice through the body. (The word tomography
comes from the Greek:
) Structures and lesions
previously impossible to visualize can now be seen with remarkable clarity. The 
principle behind CT is shown in Fig. 25–42: a thin collim
