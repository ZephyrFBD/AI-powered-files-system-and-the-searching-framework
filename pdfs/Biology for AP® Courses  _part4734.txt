Sudden and dramatic losses of biodiversity, called mass extinctions, have occurred five times.
Paleontologists have identified five strata in the fossil record that appear to show sudden and dramatic (greater than half
of all extant species disappearing from the fossil record) losses in biodiversity. These are called mass extinctions. There
are many lesser, yet still dramatic, extinction events, but the five mass extinctions have attracted the most research. An
argument can be made that the five mass extinctions are only the five most extreme events in a continuous series of large
extinction events throughout the Phanerozoic (since 542 million years ago). In most cases, the hypothesized causes are still
controversial; however, the most recent event seems clear.
The Five Mass Extinctions
The fossil record of the mass extinctions was
