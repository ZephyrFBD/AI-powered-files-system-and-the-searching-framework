Mendelian 
Genetics
(A) 
Incorrect. Both parents must be carriers because individual III-6 is 
affected. There is a 25% chance that III-5 inherited two recessive alleles. 
This would be more likely to be true if there was no affected sibling.
(B) 
Correct. Both parents must be carriers because individual III-6 is 
affected. There is a 25% chance that III-5 inherited two recessive alleles.
(C) 
Incorrect. This would require that at least one parent be affected and the 
other parent be a carrier of the recessive allele.
(D) 
Incorrect. This would require that both parents be carriers and the 
alleles that cause the disorder are dominant to the wild-type allele.
