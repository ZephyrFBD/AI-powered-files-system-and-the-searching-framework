uring intra- and interspecific competition, the reproductive rates of the individuals will usually
be lower, reducing their populationâ€™s rate of growth. In addition, low prey density increases the mortality of its predator
because it has more difficulty locating its food source.
An example of density-dependent regulation is shown in Figure 36.11 with results from a study focusing on the giant
intestinal roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), a parasite of humans and other mammals.
[3] Denser populations of the parasite
exhibited lower fecundity: they contained fewer eggs. One possible explanation for this is that females would be smaller
in more dense populations (due to limited resources) and that smaller females would have fewer eggs. This hypothesis was
tested and disproved in a 2009 study which showed that female weight had no influence.
[4] The actual cause of the density-
dependence of fecundity in this organism is still unclear and awaiting further investigation.
