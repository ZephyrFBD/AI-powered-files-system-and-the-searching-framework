ical value of 7.81, the null hypothesis
is rejected, and it is possible to say there is likely a statistically significant difference between the treated
and untreated groups. The data support the alternative hypothesis that the addition of caffeine increases the
mitotic rate in onion root cells.

Meiosis and Genetic Diversity
Learning Objectives
In this chapter, you will learn:
➜
How Meiosis Works
➜
How Meiosis Generates Genetic Diversity
Overview
Meiosis allows parents to pass on genetic information to their offspring. Meiosis helps accomplish this task while
also maintaining a consistent number of chromosomes in the offspring and creating genetic diversity in the species.
This chapter reviews the process of meiosis and how meiosis accomplishes these tasks. This chapter also compares
the similarities and differences between meiosis and mitosis.
How Meiosis Works
Meiosis is the process of cell division that is used in gamete formation. Meiosis forms haploid (n) gamet
