 hearing, the softest sound that is just
audible by a very good ear. Note that the ear is most sensitive to sounds of fre-
quency between 2000 and 4000 Hz, which are common in speech and music. Note
too that whereas a 1000-Hz sound is audible at a level of 0 dB, a 100-Hz sound
must be nearly 40 dB to be heard. The top curve in Fig. 12–6, labeled 120 phons,
represents the threshold of pain. Sounds above this level can actually be felt and
cause pain.
Figure 12–6 shows that at lower sound levels, our ears are less sensitive to the
high and low frequencies relative to middle frequencies. The “loudness” control
on some stereo systems is intended to compensate for this low-volume insensitivity.
As the volume is turned down, the loudness control boosts the high and low 
frequencies relative to the middle frequencies so that the sound will have a more
“normal-sounding” frequency balance. Many listeners, however, find the sound
more pleasing or natural without the loudness control.
