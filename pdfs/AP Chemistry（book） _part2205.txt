 purple spheres:
Box 3: Rate = k1321722 = 147k
The slowest rate is 63k (Box 2), and the highest is 147k (Box 3). 
Thus, the rates vary in the order 2 6 1 6 3.
Check Each box contains 10 spheres. The rate law indicates that 
in this case [B] has a greater influence on rate than [A] because B 
has a larger reaction order. Hence, the mixture with the highest 
concentration of B (most purple spheres) should react fastest. This 
analysis confirms the order 2 6 1 6 3.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Suppose the rate law for the reaction in this Sample Exercise 
were rate = k3A423B4. What would be the ordering of the 
rates for the three mixtures shown above, from slowest to 
fastest?
(a) 1 6 2 6 3
(b) 1 6 3 6 2 
(c) 3 6 2 6 1 
(d) 2 6 1 6 3
(e) 3 6 1 6 2
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Assuming that rate = k3A43B4, rank the mixtures represented 
in this Sample Exercise in order of increasing rate.
