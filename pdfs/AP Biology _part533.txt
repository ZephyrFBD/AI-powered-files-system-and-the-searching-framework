fuels. Nitrogen and sulfur pollutants in the air turn into nitric, nitrous,
sulfurous, and sulfuric acids, which cause the pH of the rain to be less
than 5.6. This kills the organisms in lakes and damages ancient stone
architecture.
Toxins
Toxins from industry have gotten into the food chain. Most cattle and
chicken feed contain antibiotics and hormones to accelerate animal
growth but may have serious ill effects on humans who eat the chicken and
beef. Any carcinogens or teratogens (causing birth defects) that get into
the food chain accumulate and remain in the human bodyâ€™s fatty tissues
because we occupy the top of the food chain. This process is called
biological magnification.
