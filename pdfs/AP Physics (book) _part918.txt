 the forces 
and 
don’t
get involved. Instead, let us choose as our object the point where the three
cords join (it could be a knot). The free-body diagram is then as shown in
Fig. 9–4a. The three forces—
and the tension in the vertical cord equal
to the weight of the 200-kg chandelier—act at this point where the three cords
join. For this junction point we write
and
since the problem
is laid out in two dimensions. The directions of 
and 
are known, since 
tension in a cord can only be along the cord—any other direction would cause
the cord to bend, as already pointed out in Chapter 4. Thus, our unknowns are
the magnitudes 
and 
SOLUTION We first resolve 
into its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) compo-
nents. Although we don’t know the value of 
we can write (see Fig. 9–4b)
and
has only an x component. In the
vertical direction, we have the downward force exerted by the vertical cord
equal to the weight of the chandelier
and the vertical com-
ponent of 
upward:

In the horizontal dir
