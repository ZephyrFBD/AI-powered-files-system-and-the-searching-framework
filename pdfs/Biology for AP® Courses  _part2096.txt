nesia described the Flowerpecker populations on
the mainland and the Wakatobi archipelago as one species.
A recent reassessment of the Wakatobi populations
resulted in the suggested reclassification of these
populations as a distinct species, the Wakatobi
Flowerpecker. Which of the following pieces of evidence,
if true, would be cause for this reclassification?
a.
The populations have become dependent on the
island food sources.
b.
The populations have become morphologically
distinct from the mainland species.
c.
The populations have become adapted to the
island habitat.
d.
The populations have become reproductively
isolated from the mainland species.
69. What pattern in the fossil record would you expect to
see to support the model of gradual speciation? How
would you expect this pattern to differ from a pattern in
the fossil record that supports the model of punctuated
equilibrium? Explain.
a.
In the case of gradual speciation, the fossil
record would show only a few hybrid
individua
