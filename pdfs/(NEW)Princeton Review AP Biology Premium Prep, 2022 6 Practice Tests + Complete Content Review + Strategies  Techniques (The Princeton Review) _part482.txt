up. In other words, you would expect to see each side 20 times. However, because this is an experiment and the
sample size is only 120, you will probably see some variation in the data. If you rolled 24 sixes for example, the
disagreement between observed (24) and expected (20) is small, and could have occurred by chance. If you rolled 40
sixes, however, there is a large disagreement from the expected. Maybe it is a weighted die. The region in between
these two values is trickier. Where is the line drawn between expected/normal variations and results that are so
different that they must tell a different story altogether?
Chi-square tests are one way to make this decision. They start with a null hypothesis (H0), which represents a set
numerical outcome that you want to compare your data with. The chi-square test will determine if your actual data is
close to the null hypothesis outcome and could have occurred due to a fluke (i.e., rolling a six 24 times) or if it is so
different that it
