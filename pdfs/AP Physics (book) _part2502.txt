ation-pressure” force exerted on
the enemy by the laser beam assuming her suit is perfectly
reflecting. (b) If the enemy is 30 m from the Shuttle’s
center of mass, estimate the gravitational force the Shuttle
exerts on the enemy. (c) Which of the two forces is larger,
and by what factor?
3. The Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico can detect
a radio wave with an intensity as low as 
Consider a “best-case” scenario for communication with
extraterrestrials: suppose an advanced civilization a dis-
tance x away from Earth is able to transform the entire power
output of a Sun-like star completely into a radio-wave signal
which is transmitted uniformly in all directions. (a) In order
for Arecibo to detect this radio signal, what is the maximum
value for x in light-years 
(b) How does
this maximum value compare with the 100,000-ly size of
our Milky Way galaxy? The intensity of sunlight at Earth’s
orbital distance from the Sun is

the inverse square law (Eq. 11–16b).]
