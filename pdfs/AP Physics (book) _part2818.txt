he blue and violet wavelengths. This is just the region of the spectrum
where dispersion—and thus chromatic aberration—is greatest (Fig. 24–14).
Spherical mirrors (Section 23–3) also suffer aberrations including spherical
aberration (see Fig. 23–13). Mirrors can be ground in a parabolic shape to correct
for aberrations, but they are much harder to make and therefore very expensive.
Spherical mirrors do not, however, exhibit chromatic aberration because the
light does not pass through them (no refraction, no dispersion).
25–7 Limits of Resolution;
Circular Apertures
The ability of a lens to produce distinct images of two point objects very close
together is called the resolution of the lens. The closer the two images can be and
still be seen as distinct (rather than overlapping blobs), the higher the resolution.
The resolution of a camera lens, for example, is often specified as so many dots or
lines per millimeter, as mentioned in Section 25–1.
