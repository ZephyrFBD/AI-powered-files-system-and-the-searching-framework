lences the DNA temporarily or for long periods of time. The reverse—
removing methyl groups (CH3) from highly methylated regions—can turn
genes on. The switching off of genes by methylation is probably
responsible for the long-term X-chromosome deactivation in females, as
well as long-term deactivation of genes necessary for normal cell
differentiation in embryonic development.
Epigenetic Inheritance
Epigenetic inheritance refers to alterations to the genome that do not
directly involve the nucleotide sequence. Unlike mutations, which are
permanent, these changes are reversible. The mechanism behind
epigenetics is not well understood, but we do know that environmental
factors like diet, stress, and prenatal nutrition can alter the expression of
genes. Epigenetics may explain why one identical twin can develop
schizophrenia, while the other one, who has the identical genome, does not
develop the disorder.
Regulation at the Transcription Level
Transcription is a highly regulated process.
