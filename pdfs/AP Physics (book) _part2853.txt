1. Why must a camera lens be moved farther from the sensor
or film to focus on a closer object?
2. Why is the depth of field greater, and the image sharper,
when a camera lens is “stopped down” to a larger f-number?
Ignore diffraction.
3. Describe how diffraction affects the statement of Question 2.
[Hint: See Eq. 24–3 or 25–7.]
4. Why are bifocals needed mainly by older persons and not
generally by younger people?
5. Will a nearsighted person who wears corrective lenses in
her glasses be able to see clearly underwater when wearing
those glasses? Use a diagram to show why or why not.
6. You can tell whether people are nearsighted or farsighted
by looking at the width of
their face through their
glasses. If a person’s face
appears narrower through
the glasses (Fig. 25–47),
is the person farsighted
or nearsighted? Try to
explain, but also check
experimentally 
with
friends who wear glasses.
7. In attempting to discern distant details, people will some-
times squ
