26. A scientist places free strands of DNA, which contain a gene that codes for
a protein enabling the metabolism of glucose, in a medium containing
bacteria that can only survive on the sugar lactose. The scientist heat
shocks the bacteria in CaCl2 and lets them recover before plating them in
several petri dishes with only glucose as a nutrient source. Aȇer several
days, there are no signs of bacterial growth in the glucose medium.
Which of the following is NOT a plausible explanation for the results of
the experiment?

(A)
The gene for glucose metabolism was not successfully incorporated
into any of the bacterial genomes.
(B)
The petri dishes were contaminated with a powerful antibiotic from
a previous experiment.
