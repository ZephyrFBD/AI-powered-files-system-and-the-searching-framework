isible region of the spectrum. The 
compound must therefore absorb the complementary color 
of orange, which is blue. The blue region of the spectrum 
ranges from approximately 430 nm to 490 nm. As an estimate 
we assume that the complex ion absorbs somewhere in the 
middle of the blue region, near 460 nm.
(d) Ethylenediammine is higher in the spectrochemical 
series than ammonia. Therefore, we expect a larger ∆ for 
3Co(en)343+. Because ∆ was already greater than the spin- 
pairing energy for 3Co(NH3)643+, we expect 3Co(en)343+ to be 
a low-spin complex as well, with a d 6 conﬁguration, so it will 
also be diamagnetic. The wavelength at which the complex 
absorbs light will shift to higher energy. If we assume a shift in 
the absorption maximum from blue to violet, the color of the 
complex will become yellow.
Comment The compound [Co(en)3]Cl3, which contains the 
3Co(en)343+ ion, was made and studied by Alfred Werner. This 
compound forms diamagnetic, golden-yellow crystals.
