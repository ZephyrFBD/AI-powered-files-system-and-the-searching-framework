[7.109]   
Moseley established the concept of atomic number by study-
ing X rays emitted by the elements. The X rays emitted by 
some of the elements have the following wavelengths:
Element
Wavelength (Å)
Ne
14.610
Ca
3.358
Zn
1.435
Zr
0.786
Sn
0.491
 
  
(a) Calculate the frequency, n, of the X rays emitted by each 
of the elements, in Hz. (b) Plot the square root of n versus 
the atomic number of the element. What do you observe 
about the plot? (c) Explain how the plot in part (b) allowed 
Moseley to predict the existence of undiscovered elements. 
 
(d) Use the result from part (b) to predict the X-ray wavelength 
emitted by iron. (e) A particular element emits X rays with a 
wavelength of 0.980 Å. What element do you think it is?

(a) Write the electron conﬁguration for Li and estimate the 
effective nuclear charge experienced by the valence electron. 
(b) The energy of an electron in a one-elec
