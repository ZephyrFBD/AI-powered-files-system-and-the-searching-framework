ction is 
barely so. NH4
+ is likely a weak acid. 5.124 (a) ∆H° = -65.7 kJ (b) ∆H° 
for the complete molecular equation will be the same as ∆H° for the 
net ionic equation. Since the overall enthalpy change is the enthalpy 
of products minus the enthalpy of reactants, the contributions of 
spectator ions cancel. (c) ∆H °
f for AgNO31aq2 is -100.4 kJ  >  mol.

6.2 (a) 0.1 m or 10 cm (b) No. Visible radiation has wavelengths much 
shorter than 0.1 m. (c) Energy and wavelength are inversely propor-
tional. Photons of the longer 0.1-m radiation have less energy than 
visible photons. (d) Radiation with l = 0.1 m is in the low-energy 
portion of the microwave region. The appliance is probably a micro-
wave oven. 6.5 (a) Increase (b) decrease 6.9 (a) l = 1 (b) 3py (c) (iii)  
6.13 (a) Meters (b) 1  >  second (c) meters  >  second 6.15 (a) True (b) False. 
Ultraviolet light has shorter wavelengths than visible light. (c) False. 
X-rays travel at the same speed as microwaves. (d) Fals
