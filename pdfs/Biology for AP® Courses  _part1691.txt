rotein can be thought of as the protein’s “train ticket” to its ultimate destination. Other
cellular factors recognize each signal sequence and help transport the protein from the cytoplasm to its correct compartment.
For instance, a specific sequence at the amino terminus will direct a protein to the mitochondria or chloroplasts (in plants).
Once the protein reaches its cellular destination, the signal sequence is usually clipped off.
Many proteins fold spontaneously, but some proteins require helper molecules, called chaperones, to prevent them from
aggregating during the complicated process of folding. Even if a protein is properly specified by its corresponding mRNA, it
could take on a completely dysfunctional shape if abnormal temperature or pH conditions prevent it from folding correctly.
