tors in other yeast cells that are nearby, they stop their normal growth cycles and
initiate a cell signaling cascade that includes protein kinases and GTP-binding proteins that are similar to G-proteins.

Figure 9.16 Budding Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells can communicate by releasing a signaling molecule
called mating factor. In this micrograph, they are visualized using differential interference contrast microscopy, a light
microscopy technique that enhances the contrast of the sample.
Signaling in Bacteria
Signaling in bacteria enables bacteria to monitor extracellular conditions, ensure that there are sufficient amounts of
nutrients, and ensure that hazardous situations are avoided. There are circumstances, however, when bacteria communicate
with each other.
The first evidence of bacterial communication was observed in a bacterium that has a symbiotic relationship with Hawaiian
bobtail squid. When the population density of the bacteria reache
