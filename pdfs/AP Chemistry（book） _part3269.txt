cause the standard emf is zero, only a small emf is needed to cause the transfer of nickel 
atoms from one electrode to the other.
Quantitative aspects of Electrolysis
The stoichiometry of a half-reaction shows how many electrons are needed to achieve 
an electrolytic process. For example, the reduction of Na+ to Na is a one-electron process:
Na+ + e- ยก Na
Thus, 1 mol of electrons plates out 1 mol of Na metal, 2 mol of electrons plate out 2 mol 
of Na metal, and so forth. Similarly, 2 mol of electrons are required to produce 1 mol of Cu 
from Cu2+, and 3 mol of electrons are required to produce 1 mol of Al from Al3+:
Cu2+ + 2 e- ยก Cu
  Al3+ + 3 e- ยก Al
For any half-reaction, the amount of substance reduced or oxidized in an electrolytic cell 
is directly proportional to the number of electrons passed into the cell.
The quantity of charge passing through an electrical circuit, such as that in an elec-
trolytic cell, is generally measured in coulombs. As noted in Section 20.5, the charge
