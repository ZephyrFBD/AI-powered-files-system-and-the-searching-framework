st
likely happen to the frequencies of A and a if heterozygous
individuals were favored by natural selection?
a.
Both AA and aa will drop in frequency by the
same amount.
b.
Both AA and aa will drop, but aa will drop
more.
c.
AA will increase in frequency and aa will drop
in frequency.
d.
aa will increase in frequency and AA will drop
in frequency.
38. The diagram below shows the frequency of alleles on
two species of wind-pollinated plants, as well as the
prevailing wind direction. These frequencies have been
fairly stable for around 10 years. However, climate change
has created a new prevailing wind direction, as shown in
the diagram. How will the two populations likely evolve in
the future?
a.
natural selection will cause the frequency of B to
increase in population 1
b.
gene flow will cause the frequencies of A and B
to drop in population 3
c.
genetic drift will cause the frequencies of A and
C to increase in population 1 and 2
d.
inbreeding will reduce the frequency of allele B
in
