Table 2.3
A. Using a spreadsheet, or by sharing calculations with
your classmates, construct a quantitative model of these
data from these percentages as ratios of mass fractions
relative to that of sodium, %X/%Na. Of course, you will
not be asked to use a spreadsheet on the AP Biology
Exam. However, the ability to develop a quantitative
model through the transformation of numerical data can be
assessed. The question that led Macallum to investigate
the elemental composition of different species and
compare these with the composition of seawater follows
from the central organizing principle of biology: the theory
of evolution.
B. The elements in the table above all occur in aqueous
solution as ions. The net charges on the inside and outside
of a cell are both zero. A very large di
