ntermediate trait, wavy hair. In still other cases, there may be no apparent rationale,
except perhaps historical, for the notation used to indicate different alleles.
Codominance
Another kind of inheritance pattern is termed codominance. In this pattern, both inherited alleles are completely
expressed. For example, the M and N blood types produce two molecules that appear on the surface of human red
blood cells. The M (sometimes written as LM) allele produces a certain blood molecule. The N (sometimes written
as LN) allele produces another molecule. Individuals who are MM (LMLM) produce one kind of molecule; those
who are NN (LNLN) produce a second kind of molecule; and those who are MN (LM LN) produce both kinds of
molecules.
To help you distinguish the three kinds of inheritance, imagine a continuum. At one extreme, there is complete
dominance by a dominant allele over a recessive allele. At the other extreme, both alleles are expressed
(codominance). Between the two extremes, a ble
