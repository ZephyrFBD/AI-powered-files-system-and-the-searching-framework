e ovaries grow and secrete increasing amounts
of estrogen in response to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
from the anterior pituitary.
Ovulation
The secondary oocyte ruptures out of the ovaries in response to
luteinizing hormone (LH).
Luteal phase The corpus luteum forms in response to luteinizing hormone. It is
the follicle left behind after ovulation, and it secretes estrogen and
progesterone, which thicken the endometrium of the uterus.
MenstruationThis is the monthly shedding of the lining of the uterus when
implantation of an embryo does not occur.
Figure 18.3 illustrates the menstrual cycle, and Figure 18.4 illustrates the
hormonal control of the menstrual cycle.
