Equivalence point
Equivalence point
Good choice. Suitable indicator for titration of a 
weak acid with a strong base because equivalence 
point falls within the color-change interval
Poor choice. Unsatisfactory indicator for titration of a 
weak acid with a strong base because color  
changes before reaching equivalence point
