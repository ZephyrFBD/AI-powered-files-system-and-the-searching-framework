ns. The P3- ion, 
like N3-, has a strong affinity for protons and reacts with H2O 
to form OH- and PH3 (PH2-, PH2
-, and PH3 are all exceedingly 
weak proton donors).
 
Mg3P21s2 + 6 H2O1l2 ¡ 2 PH31g2 + 3 Mg1OH221s2
 
Mg1OH22 has low solubility in water and will precipitate.

Write a balanced equation for the reaction of solid sodium 
hydride with water.
22.2 ∣ Hydrogen
Because hydrogen produces water when burned in air, the French chemist Antoine 
Lavoisier 
 (Figure 3.1) gave it the name hydrogen, which means “water producer” 
(Greek: hydro, water; gennao, to produce).
Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. It is the nuclear fuel con-
sumed by our Sun and other stars to produce energy. 
 (Section 21.8) Although about 
75% of the known mass of the universe is hydrogen, it constitutes only 0.87% of Earth’s 
mass. Mo
