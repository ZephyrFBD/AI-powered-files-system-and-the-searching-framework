is incorrect. Mechanical isolation occurs when the genitalia of the male and female cannot
successfully copulate, so choice (D) is incorrect.
8. (C) Temporal isolation is separation by time. Since the two species flower and are ready for pollination at
different times, this is an example of temporal isolation. Habitat isolation is separation by area, so choice (A) is
incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because mechanical isolation occurs when the male and female genitalia are
incompatible. Hybrid breakdown occurs when two species can produce a viable and fertile offspring but each
successive generation of the hybrid becomes weaker and weaker, so choice (D) is incorrect.
9. (B) Since their copulating organs do not align, these snails cannot exchange gametes, so this is an example of
mechanical isolation. Choice (A) is an example of gametic isolation. Choice (C) is an example of temporal
isolation. Choice (D) is an example of reduced hybrid viability.
10. (B) Since tigers and leopards can
