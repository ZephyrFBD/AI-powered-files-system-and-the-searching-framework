hairs (trichomes) in a population 
of 150 plants, do you present each data point on a graph, or do you compile the data 
into an overall picture? If all data points are the same, then there would be no need to 
present data graphically, but the messy reality is that the counts likely could vary from 0 
to more than 50 hairs per plant. For this reason, a histogram (see Figure 2) is often used 
to represent the variability and distribution of population data.

In a histogram, the data are organized into bins with a defined range of values. For 
example, for the hairy plants the bin size might be 10 hairs, and bins defined in this 
manner might include 1–10 hairs, 11–20 hairs, 21–30 hairs, and so on. You simply count 
the number of plants that fall into each bin, and then graph the d
