tal, the 2s.
We can represent any electron configuration by writing the symbol for the  
occupied 
subshell and adding a superscript to indicate the number of electrons in that subshell. 
For example, for lithium we write 1s22s1 (read “1s two, 2s one”). We can also show the 
arrangement of the electrons as

▲ Figure 6.27 Nuclear spin. Like electron spin, nuclear spin generates 
a small magnetic field and has two allowed values. (a) In the absence 
of an external magnetic field, the two spin states have the same 
energy. (b) When an external magnetic field is applied, the spin state 
in which the spin direction is parallel to the direction of the external 
field is lower in energy than the spin state in which the spin direction is 
antiparallel to the field direction. The energy difference, ∆E, is in the 
radio frequency p
