the nucleus. For example, estrogen diffuses across the plasma membrane,
binds to a receptor in the cytoplasm, and initiates a response inside the
cell. We now know that there are some substances in the environment, like
bisphenol A, a chemical present in many plastics, that mimic hormones
like estrogen. Bisphenol A is known as an estrogen mimic because it sets

up an estrogen signal transduction pathway, even though no estrogen is
present. It is believed to be responsible for problems in fetal development
in humans.
Transduction
Once activated, the receptor converts (transduces) a molecular signal into a
cell response. This transduction sometimes occurs in a single step, but
more often it requires a sequence of changes in a series of different
moleculesâ€”a signal transduction pathway.
Signal transduction pathway is a multistep process in which a small
number of extracellular signal molecules produce a major cellular
response, a cascade effect,
