ion to be stable relative to the separated He and He+. Formation 
of He2
+ in the gas phase has been demonstrated in laboratory 
experiments.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
How many of the following molecules and ions have a bond  
order of 1
2 : H2, H2
+, H2
-, and He2
2 +? 
(a) 0 (b) 1 (c) 2 (d) 3  (e) 4
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
What are the electron configuration and the bond order of the 
H2
- ion?
What is the bond order of the He2
+ ion? Would you expect this ion to be stable relative to the separated He atom and He+ ion?
*Antibonding MOs are slightly more energetically unfavorable than bonding MOs are energeti-
cally favorable. Thus, whenever there is an equal number of electrons in bonding and antibond-
ing orbitals, the energy of the molecule is slightly higher than that for the separated atoms. As a 
result, no bond is formed.
Give It Some Thought
Suppose one electron in H2 is excited from the s
1s MO to the s
1s
*  MO. Would you 
expect the H atoms to remain bonded to each other, o
