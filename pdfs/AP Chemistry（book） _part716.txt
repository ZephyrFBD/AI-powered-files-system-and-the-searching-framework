The significant figures are correct (3), and the units are the 
requested ones for energy (J). The negative sign is consistent with 
an expanding gas doing work on its surroundings.
Enthalpy Change
Let’s now return to our discussion of enthalpy. When a change occurs at constant pres-
sure, the change in enthalpy, ∆H, is given by the relationship
∆H = ∆1E + PV2 
 
 = ∆E + P∆V 1constant pressure2 
[5.8]
That is, the change in enthalpy equals the change in internal energy plus the product of 
the constant pressure and the change in volume.
Recall that ∆E = q + w (Equation 5.4) and that the work involved in the expansion 
or compression of a gas is w = -P∆V (at constant pressure). Substituting -w for P∆V 
and q + w for ∆E into Equation 5.8, we have
 
∆H = ∆E + P∆V = 1qP + w2 - w = qP 
[5.9]
The subscript P on q indicates that the process occurs at constant pressure. Thus, the equa-
tions show: 
The change in enthalpy equals the heat qP gained or lost at constant pressure. 
Because qP is so
