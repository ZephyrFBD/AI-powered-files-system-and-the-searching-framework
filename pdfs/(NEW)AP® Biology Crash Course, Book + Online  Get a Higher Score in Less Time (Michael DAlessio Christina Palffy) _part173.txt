 to survive to reproduce.
(C) If an organism acquires a trait after it is born, then it will not be passed on to its offspring.
(D) If an organism does not use a part of its body, it will eventually disappear.
12. Pictured below are two of the many amino acids that make up a protein. Looking at just the side chains
(the part in the boxes), what can be deduced about the polarity of the two amino acids and their resulting
placement in the protein?
(A) Both are polar and hydrophilic and therefore will be on the inside of the protein structure.
(B) Threonine is polar and hydrophilic, and will be on the outside of the protein structure, and alanine is
nonpolar and hydrophobic, and will be on the inside of the protein structure.
(C) Both are polar and hydrophilic and will be on the outside of the protein structure.
(D) Threonine is polar and hydrophilic, and will be on the inside of the protein structure, and glycine is
nonpolar and hydrophobic, and will be on the outside of the protein stru
