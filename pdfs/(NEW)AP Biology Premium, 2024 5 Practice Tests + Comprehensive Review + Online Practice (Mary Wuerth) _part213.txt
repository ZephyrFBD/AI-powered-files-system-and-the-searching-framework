l of the carbon that was originally in the glucose molecule at the start
of glycolysis has been released as carbon dioxide. (See Figure 9.3 and Table 9.4.)
During one turn of the Krebs cycle, four electron carriers are reduced. Three molecules of NAD+ are reduced to
NADH, and one molecule of FAD+ is reduced to FADH2. In addition, one molecule of ATP is produced through
substrate-level phosphorylation (the direct addition of a phosphate group to ADP without the use of an electron
transport chain or chemiosmosis).
There are two methods of ATP production you need to understand for the AP Biology exam: substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative
phosphorylation. Substrate-level phosphorylation is a simpler process, but oxidative phosphorylation allows for the production of greater
amounts of ATP.
