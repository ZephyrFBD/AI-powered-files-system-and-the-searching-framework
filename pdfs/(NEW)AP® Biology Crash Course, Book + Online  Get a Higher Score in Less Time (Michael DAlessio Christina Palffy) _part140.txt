nues to Occur
1. Scientific evidence supports the premise that evolution continues to occur.
Examples include:
Emergent diseases
Chemical resistances caused by mutations, such as resistance to antibiotics, pesticides,
herbicides, and chemotherapy drugs
Phenotypic change in a population (such as Darwin’s finches in the Galapagos)
Eukaryotes eventual development of structures such as limbs, brain, and immune system
C. Phylogenetic Trees and Cladograms
1. Represent traits that are either derived or lost due to evolution, such as opposable thumbs, the absence
of legs in some sea animals, and the number of heart chambers in animals.
2. Illustrate that speciation has occurred and show when two groups were derived from a common
ancestor.
3. Can be constructed from either morphological similarities or from DNA and protein sequence
similarities by utilizing a computer program that measures the organisms’ interrelatedness.
4. Provide a dynamic snapshot that is constantly being revised.
