31. (II) A model-train transformer plugs into 120-V ac and draws
0.35 A while supplying 6.8 A to the train. (a) What voltage
is present across the tracks? (b) Is the transformer step-up
or step-down?
32. (II) The output voltage of a 95-W transformer is 12 V, and
the input current is 25 A. (a) Is this a step-up or a step-down
transformer? (b) By what factor is the voltage multiplied?
33. (II) A transformer has 330 primary turns and 1240 secondary
turns. The input voltage is 120 V and the output current is
15.0 A. What are the output voltage and input current?
34. (II) If 35 MW of power at 45 kV (rms) arrives at a town from
a generator via 
transmission lines, calculate (a) the
emf at the generator end of the lines, and (b) the fraction
of the power generated that is wasted in the lines.
35. (II) For the transmission of electric power from power plant
to home, as depicted in Fig. 21â€“25, where the electric power
sent by the plant is 100 kW, about how far away could the
house be fr
