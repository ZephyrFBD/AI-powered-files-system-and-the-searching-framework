.9 than
an electric heater that costs $2000 to heat their home for a
year? If the conversion to the heat pump costs $15,000, how
long would it take the family to break even on heating costs?
How much would the family save in 20 years?
15–7 Entropy
39. (I) What is the change in entropy of 320 g of steam at
100°C when it is condensed to water at 100°C?
40. (I) 1.0 kg of water is heated from 0°C to 100°C. Estimate
the change in entropy of the water.
41. (I) What is the change in entropy of 
of water at
0°C when it is frozen to ice at 0°C?
42. (II) A 5.8-kg box having an initial speed of 
slides
along a rough table and comes to rest. Estimate the total
change in entropy of the universe. Assume all objects are
at room temperature (293 K).
43. (II) If 
of water at 0°C is frozen and cooled to
by being in contact with a great deal of ice at
estimate the total change in entropy of the process.
44. (II) An aluminum rod conducts 
from a heat source
maintained at 225°C to a large body of water at
