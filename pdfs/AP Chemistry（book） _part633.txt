, the balanced molecular equation for the 
reaction is:
(b)  
To determine the limiting reactant, we must examine the 
number of moles of each reactant. 
 (Section 3.7) The num-
ber of moles of K3PO4 is calculated from the mass of the sample 
using the molar mass as a conversion factor. 
 (Section 3.4)  
The molar mass of K3PO4 is 3139.12 + 31.0 + 4116.02 =
212.3 g>mol. Converting milligrams to grams and then to 
moles, we have:
We determine the number of moles of AgNO3 from the vol-
ume and molarity of the solution. (Section 4.5) Converting 
milliliters to liters and then to moles, we have:
K3PO41aq2 + 3 AgNO31aq2 ยก Ag3PO41s2 + 3 KNO31aq2
170.5 mg K3PO42a
10-3 g K3PO4
1 mg K3PO4
b a
1 mol K3PO4
212.3 g K3PO4

= 3.32 * 10-4 mol K3PO4
115.0 mL2a 10-3 L
1 mL b a
0.050 mol AgNO3

b 
= 7.5 * 10-4 mol AgNO3
Comparing the amounts of the two reactants, we find that 
there are 17.5 * 10-42>13.32 * 10-42 = 2.3 times as many 
moles of AgNO3 as there are moles of K3PO4. According to
