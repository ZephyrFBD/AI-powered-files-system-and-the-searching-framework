al genes to their
offspring, so choice (D) is incorrect.
46. (C) Females have two X chromosomes, and the genes for color blindness are located on the X chromosome.
Females inherit one X chromosome from each parent. If the female in the question stem does not express color
blindness, one of her X chromosomes does not contain the color blindness allele. Her father was color-blind, so
the X chromosome she inherited from him must have the color blindness allele, and therefore she must be
heterozygous (XBXb). If she has a child with a man who is not color-blind (XBY) and that child is a son, the
likelihood the son would be color-blind would be 50%, as shown in the following Punnett square.
Choices (A), (B), and (D) do not list the correct percentage.
47. (A) The color-blindness trait is recessive. In order for the daughter to be color-blind, she would have to inherit
the allele from each of her parents. Since her father is not color-blind, she cannot inherit the allele from him, so
there is
