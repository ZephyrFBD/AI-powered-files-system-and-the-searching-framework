mber.* The 
trends seen in the graph are a result of two competing forces. 
On the one hand, increasing effective nuclear charge favors a 
decrease in radius as we move left to right across each period. 
 
 (Section 7.2) On the other hand, the metallic bonding 
strength increases until we reach the middle of each period and 
then decreases as we fill antibonding orbitals. 
 (Section 12.4) 
As a general rule, a bond shortens as it becomes stronger. 
 (Sec-
tion 8.8) For groups 3B through 6B, these two effects work cooper-
atively and the result is a marked decrease in radius. In elements to 
the right of group 6B, the two effects counteract each other, reduc-
ing the decrease and eventually leading to an increase in radius.
