ATP to ADP is an energetically favorable exergonic reaction.
This release of free energy is coupled to endergonic reactions such as the
synthesis of glutamine, an essential amino acid.
The Importance of Water
A water molecule is formed between two H atoms bonded covalently to a
single O atom. The oxygen molecule tends to control all of the electrons
by keeping them away from the hydrogen atoms, giving the oxygen a
slightly negative charge, which is balanced by slightly positive charges on
the hydrogen atoms. This is an example of a polar covalent bond. The
water molecule looks like Mickey Mouse because it has a big head (the
oxygen atom) and two big ears (the hydrogen atoms).
3.3 Recognize the role of water in biological processes
The head has a slightly negative charge and the ears have a slightly
positive charge, which makes water a polar compound. The shape and
charge of this molecule give it unique properties.
Water is the only substance on Earth that commonly exists in all three
