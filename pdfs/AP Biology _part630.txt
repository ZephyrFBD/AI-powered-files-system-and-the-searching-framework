ne molecule of water leaves a leaf by
transpiration, another is pulled in through the roots.
(D) When stomates open, CO2 moves inward, not outward. As water
vapor leaves the leaf through open stomates, other molecules of
water are pulled in at the roots and into the xylem by transpirational
pull. When light strikes a leaf, guard cells become rigid or turgid,
which changes their shape, causing stomates to open. Thus, when
stomates are open, the guard cells are rigid or turgid, not flaccid.
(D) Stomates open as the guard cells that control stomate function fill
with water and become turgid. Stomates close as the guard cells that
control stomate function lose water and become flaccid. Aquaporins
allow large amounts of water to rapidly diffuse across membranes
into cells. Choice A is incorrect because fruit ripening is caused by
the hormone ethylene gas; it would be unaffected by the presence or
absence of aquaporins. Choice B is incorrect because circadian
rhythm and flowering in plants a
