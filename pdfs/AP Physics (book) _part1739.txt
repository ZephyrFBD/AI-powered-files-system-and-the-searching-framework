Equation 16–2 looks more complicated than Eq. 16–1, but other fundamental
equations we haven’t seen yet are simpler in terms of 
rather than k. It doesn’t
matter which form we use since Eqs. 16–1 and 16–2 are equivalent. (The latest
precise values of e and 
are given inside the front cover.)†
Equations 16–1 and 16–2 apply to objects whose size is much smaller than
the distance between them. Ideally, it is precise for point charges (spatial size
negligible compared to other distances). For finite-sized objects, it is not always
clear what value to use for r, particularly since the charge may not be distributed
uniformly on the objects. If the two objects are spheres and the charge is known
to be distributed uniformly on each, then r is the distance between their centers.
Coulomb’s law describes the force between two charges when they are at rest.
Additional forces come into play when charges are in motion, and will be
