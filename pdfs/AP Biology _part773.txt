 undergoes mitosis to produce primary oocytes
(2n). These remain quiescent within small follicles in the ovaries until
puberty, when they become reactivated by hormones. FSH periodically
stimulates the follicles to complete meiosis I, producing secondary
oocytes (n), which are released at ovulation. Meiosis II then stops again
and does not continue until fertilization, when a sperm penetrates the
secondary oocyte. See Figure 18.6. Oogenesis differs from sperm
formation in three ways. First, it is a stop-start process. It begins prior to
birth and is completed after fertilization. Second, cytokinesis divides the
cytoplasm of the cell unequally, producing one large cell and two small
polar bodies which will disintegrate. Third, one primary oogonium cell
produces only one active egg cell.
