in an organismâ€™s genome existed in abundant
supply and functioned optimally under all cellular conditions, in all cells, at all times. In reality, this is far from the case.
A variety of mechanisms ensure that this does not happen. Cellular needs and conditions vary from cell to cell, and change
within individual cells over time. The required enzymes and energetic demands of stomach cells are different from those
of fat storage cells, skin cells, blood cells, and nerve cells. Furthermore, a digestive cell works much harder to process and
break down nutrients during the time that closely follows a meal compared with many hours after a meal. As these cellular
demands and conditions vary, so do the amounts and functionality of different enzymes.
Since the rates of biochemical reactions are controlled by activation energy, and enzymes lower and determine activation
energies for chemical reactions, the relative amounts and functioning of the variety of enzymes within a cell ultimately
deter
