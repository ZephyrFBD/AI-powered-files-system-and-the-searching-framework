 3.114  The source of oxygen that drives the internal combustion 
engine in an automobile is air. Air is a mixture of gases, prin-
cipally N21∼79%2 and O21∼20%2. In the cylinder of an au-
tomobile engine, nitrogen can react with oxygen to produce 
nitric oxide gas, NO. As NO is emitted from the tailpipe of 
the car, it can react with more oxygen to produce nitrogen 
dioxide gas. (a) Write balanced chemical equations for both 
reactions. (b) Both nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide are pol-
lutants that can lead to acid rain and global warming; collec-
tively, they are called “NOx” gases. In 2009, the United States 
emitted an estimated 19 million tons of nitrogen dioxide 
into the atmosphere. How many grams of nitrogen dioxide is 
this? (c) The production of NOx gases is an unwanted side reac-
tion of the main engine combustion process that turns octane, 
C8H18, into CO2 and water. If 85% of the oxygen in an engine is 
used to combust octane and the rem
