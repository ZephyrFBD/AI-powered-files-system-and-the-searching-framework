lar secretion mechanisms by the cells lining the Malpighian tubules that
are bathed in hemolymph (a mixture of blood and interstitial fluid that is found in insects and other arthropods as well as
most mollusks). Metabolic wastes like uric acid freely diffuse into the tubules. There are exchange pumps lining the tubules,
which actively transport H+ ions into the cell and K+ or Na+ ions out; water passively follows to form urine. The secretion
of ions alters the osmotic pressure which draws water, electrolytes, and nitrogenous waste (uric acid) into the tubules. Water
and electrolytes are reabsorbed when these organisms are faced with low-water environments, and uric acid is excreted as a
thick paste or powder. Not dissolving wastes in water helps these organisms to conserve water; this is especially important
for life in dry environments.
