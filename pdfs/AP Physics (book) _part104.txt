everyone has a piano. A guess of 1 family in 3 having a piano would corre-

†A check of the San Francisco Yellow Pages (done after this calculation) reveals about 60 listings.
Each of these listings may employ more than one tuner, but on the other hand, each may also do
repairs as well as tuning. In any case, our estimate is reasonable.

Estimating how many piano tuners
there are in a city
As an order of magnitude, let’s say 1 piano per 10 people. This is certainly 
more reasonable than 1 per 100 people, or 1 per every person, so let’s 
proceed with the estimate that 1 person in 10 has a piano,
or about 
80,000 pianos in San Francisco. Now a piano tuner needs an hour or two to
