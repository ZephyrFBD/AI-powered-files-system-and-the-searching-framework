n’s second law to an object of mass m falling freely
due to gravity. For the acceleration,
we use the downward acceleration due to
gravity,
Thus, the gravitational force on an object,
can be written as
(4;3)
The direction of this force is down toward the center of the Earth. The magnitude
of the force of gravity on an object, mg, is commonly called the object’s weight.
In SI units,
‡ so the weight of a 1.00-kg mass on
Earth is  
We will mainly be concerned with the
weight of objects on Earth, but we note that on the Moon, on other planets, or in
space, the weight of a given mass will be different than it is on Earth. For exam-
ple, on the Moon the acceleration due to gravity is about one-sixth what it is on
Earth, and a 1.0-kg mass weighs only 1.6 N. Although we will not use British
units, we note that for practical purposes on the Earth, a mass of 1.0 kg weighs
about 2.2 lb. (On the Moon, 1 kg weighs only about 0.4 lb.)
The force of gravity acts on an object when it is falling. When a
