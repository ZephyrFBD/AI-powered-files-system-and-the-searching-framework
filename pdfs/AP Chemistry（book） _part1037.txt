obtains 
the following plot. The point labeled “n0” corresponds to light 
with a wavelength of 542 nm. (a) What is the value of n0 in s - 1? 
(b) What is the value of the work function of the metal in units 
of kJ>mol of ejected electrons? (c) Note that when the frequen-
cy of the light is greater than n0, the plot shows a straight line 
with a nonzero slope. What is the slope of this line segment?

 6.82  If you put 120 volts of electricity through a pickle, the pickle 
will smoke and start glowing orange-yellow. The light is emit-
ted because sodium ions in the pickle become excited; their 
return to the ground state results in light emission. (a) The 
wavelength of this emitted light is 589 nm. Calculate its fre-
quency. (b) What is the energy of 1.00 mol of these photons 
(a mole of photons is called an Einstein)? (c) Calculate the 
energy gap between the excited and ground states for the 
sodium ion. (d) If you soaked the pickle for a lo
