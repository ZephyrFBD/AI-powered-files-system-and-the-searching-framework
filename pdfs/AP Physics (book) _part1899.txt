FIGURE 17–32 Example of an
image made up of many small
squares or pixels (picture elements).
This one has rather low resolution.
FIGURE 17–33 Array of wires 
(a matrix) behind all the pixels on an
LCD screen. Each intersection of two
wires is at a subpixel (red, green, or
blue). One horizontal wire is activated
at a time (the orange one at the
moment shown) meaning it is at a
positive voltage 
which
allows that one row of pixels to be
addressed at that moment; all 
other horizontal wires are at 
. At
this moment, the data stream arrives
to all the vertical wires, presenting the
needed voltage (between 0 and 
)
to produce the correct brightness for
each of the nearly 6000 subpixels along
the activated row.
