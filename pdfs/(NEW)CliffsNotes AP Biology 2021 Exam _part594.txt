r the feedback mechanism is negative (parts a, b, and c) or
positive (part d). Then, for a negative feedback mechanism, explain how a change in a deviation away from the
normal range of values is detected, how the deviation is restored to normal (often by the action of a hormone), and
once normalcy has been attained, how the action is terminated. For a positive feedback mechanism, describe the
mechanism that drives the condition to values further and further beyond normal and what causes the mechanism to
stop.
Questions involving feedback mechanisms are common on the AP exam, both as free response and multiple choice.
Additional negative feedback mechanisms are described in other chapters of this book and involve the following
processes:
1. hormone regulation of the menstrual cycle
2. regulation of population size
3. the rate of an enzyme reaction (through feedback inhibition and allosteric enzymes, for example)
 
4. gene regulation by repressible and inducible enzymes
