 transpiration(Figure 23.35). Desert plants
(xerophytes) and plants that grow on other plants (epiphytes) have limited access to water. Such plants usually have a
much thicker waxy cuticle than those growing in more moderate, well-watered environments (mesophytes). Aquatic plants
(hydrophytes) also have their own set of anatomical and morphological leaf adaptations.
Figure 23.35 Plants are suited to their local environment. (a) Xerophytes, like this prickly pear cactus (Opuntia
sp.) and (b) epiphytes such as this tropical Aeschynanthus perrottetii have adapted to very limited water resources.
The leaves of a prickly pear are modified into spines, which lowers the surface-to-volume ratio and reduces water
loss. Photosynthesis takes place in the stem, which also stores water. (b) A. perottetii leaves have a waxy cuticle
that prevents water loss. (c) Goldenrod (Solidago sp.) is a mesophyte, well suited for moderate environments. (d)
Hydrophytes, like this fragrant water lily (Nymphaea odo
