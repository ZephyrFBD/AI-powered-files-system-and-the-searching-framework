fideâ€™s most readily recognized properties is its odor, which is most frequently encoun-
tered as the offensive odor of rotten eggs. Hydrogen sulfide is toxic, but our noses can 
detect H2S in extremely low, nontoxic concentrations. A sulfur-containing organic 
molecule, such as dimethyl sulfide, 1CH322S, which is similarly odoriferous and can be 
detected by smell at a level of one part per trillion, is added to natural gas as a safety factor 
to give it a detectable odor.
Oxides, Oxyacids, and Oxyanions of Sulfur
Sulfur dioxide, formed when sulfur burns in air, has a choking odor and is poisonous. 
The gas is particularly toxic to lower organisms, such as fungi, so it is used to sterilize 
dried fruit and wine. At 1 atm and room temperature, SO2 dissolves in water to produce 
a 1.6 M solution. The SO2 solution is acidic, and we describe it as sulfurous acid 1H2SO32.
Salts of SO3
