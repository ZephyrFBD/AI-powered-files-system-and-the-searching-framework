ere and zilch.
Dr Andrew Kaufman is a board-certiﬁed forensic psychiatrist in
New York State, a Doctor of Medicine and former Assistant
Professor and Medical Director of Psychiatry at SUNY Upstate
Medical University, and Medical Instructor of Hematology and
Oncology at the Medical School of South Carolina. He also studied
biology at the MassachuseĴs Institute of Technology (MIT) and
trained in Psychiatry at Duke University. Kaufman is retired from
allopathic medicine, but remains a consultant and educator on
natural healing, I saw a video of his very early on in the ‘Covid’ hoax
in which he questioned claims about the ‘virus’ in the absence of any
supporting evidence and with plenty pointing the other way. I did
everything I could to circulate his work which I felt was asking the
pivotal questions that needed an answer. I can recommend an
excellent pull-together interview he did with the website The Last
Vagabond entitled Dr Andrew Kaufman: Virus Isolation, Terrain Theory
and Covid-19
