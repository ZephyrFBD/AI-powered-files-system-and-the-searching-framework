tant expression is 
written as
Kc =
3D4d3E4e
3A4a3B4b
where Kc is a dimensionless constant called the equilibrium constant. 
When the equilibrium system of interest consists of gases, it is often 
convenient to express the concentrations of reactants and products 
in terms of gas pressures:
Kp =
1P
D2d1P
E2e
1P
A2a1P
B2b
Kc and Kp are related by the expression Kp = Kc1RT2∆n. To do this 
conversion properly, use R = 0.08206 L@atm>mol@K and temperature 
in kelvins.
UNDERSTANDING AND WORKING WITH EQUILIBRIUM CON-
STANTS (SECTION 15.3) The value of the equilibrium constant 
changes with temperature. A large value of Kc indicates that the 
equilibrium mixture contains more products than reactants and 
therefore lies toward the product side of the equation. A small value 
for the equilibrium constant means that the equilibrium mixture
