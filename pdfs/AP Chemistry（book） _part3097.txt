lculate the Ksp values in the same way we applied 
Equation 19.21 in Sample Exercise 19.12. We use the ∆G°
soln 
values we obtained in part (a), remembering to convert them 
from kJ>mol to J>mol:
 
NaCl: Ksp = 3Na+43Cl-4 = e-1-91002>318.3142129824
 = e+3.7 = 40
 
AgCl: Ksp = 3Ag+43Cl-4 = e-1+55,6002>318.3142129824
 = e-22.4
 = 1.9 * 10-10
The value calculated for the Ksp of AgCl is very close to that 
listed in Appendix D.
(d) A soluble salt is one that dissolves appreciably in water.  
 (Section 4.2) The Ksp value for NaCl is greater than 1, indi-
cating that NaCl dissolves to a great extent. The Ksp value for 
AgCl is very small, indicating that very little dissolves in water. 
Silver chloride should indeed be considered an insoluble salt.
(e) As we expect, the solution process has a positive value of ∆S for 
both salts (see the table in part b). As such, the entropy term 
of the free-energy change, -T∆S°
soln, is negative. If we assume 
that ∆H°
soln and ∆S°
soln do not change much
