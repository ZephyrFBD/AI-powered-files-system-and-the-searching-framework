at provide a survival advantage will increase, leading to the evolution of the population.
Directional Selection
The type of selection that was seen in the peppered moths example is directional selection. Directional selection
occurs when one end of the range of phenotypes is favored by natural selection, causing the frequency of that
phenotype to increase over time. Directional selection is represented by the graph in Figure 19.3.

Stabilizing Selection
Natural selection can also lead to stabilizing selection, where the intermediate phenotype is favored and extreme
phenotypes are selected against. Clutch size (the number of eggs produced per reproductive cycle by birds) exhibits
stabilizing selection. If a bird lays a large number of eggs, that bird may have too many offspring to care for and
feed, leading to poor reproductive success. However, if the bird lays only one or two eggs per reproductive cycle,
there is a risk that none of the offspring may
