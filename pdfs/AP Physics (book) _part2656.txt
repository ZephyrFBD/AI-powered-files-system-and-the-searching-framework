 the
edges and would constructively interfere at the center of the shadow (Fig. 24–18).
That prediction seemed very unlikely. But when the experiment was actually carried
out by Francois Arago, the bright spot was seen at the very center of the shadow
(Fig. 24–19a). This was strong evidence for the wave theory.
Figure 24–19a is a photograph of the shadow cast by a coin using a coherent
point source of light, a laser in this case. The bright spot is clearly present at the
center. Note also the bright and dark fringes beyond the shadow. These resemble
the interference fringes of a double slit. Indeed, they are due to interference of
waves diffracted around the outer edge of the disk, and the group of fringes is
referred to as a diffraction pattern. A diffraction pattern exists around any sharp-
edged object illuminated by a point source, as shown in Figs. 24–19b and c. We
are not always aware of diffraction because most sources of light in everyday life
are not points, so light from diff
