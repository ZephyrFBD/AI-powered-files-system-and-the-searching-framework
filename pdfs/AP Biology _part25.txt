cellular respiration. Therefore, in this scenario, you would have lost all of
the points that you had earned on this part of the question.
Watch the Point Count!
On the AP Biology exam, each free-response question will state the point
value next to each part of the question. For example, a long free-response
question may be divided into four parts, where Part A is worth 1–2 points,
Part B is worth 3–4 points, Part C is worth 1–3 points, and Part D is worth
2–4 points. If
