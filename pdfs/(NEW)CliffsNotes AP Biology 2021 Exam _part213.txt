Cell Division
Review
Cell division consists of two phases, nuclear division followed by cytokinesis. Nuclear division divides the genetic
material in the nucleus, while cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm. There are two kinds of nuclear division—mitosis
and meiosis. Mitosis divides the nucleus so that both daughter cells are genetically identical. In contrast, meiosis is a
reduction division, producing genetically variable daughter cells that contain half the genetic information of the
parent cell.
The first step in either mitosis or meiosis begins with the condensation of the genetic material, chromatin, into
tightly coiled bodies, the chromosomes. Each chromosome is made of two identical halves called sister chromatids
joined at the centromere (Figure 7-1). Each chromatid consists of a single, tightly coiled molecule of DNA, the
genetic material of the cell. In diploid cells, there are two copies of every chromosome, forming a
