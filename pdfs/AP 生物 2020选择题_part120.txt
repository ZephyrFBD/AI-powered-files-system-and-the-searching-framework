Topic
1.C: Explain biological concepts, 
processes, and/or models in 
applied contexts.
IST-1.N: Describe the 
mechanisms by which 
genetic information flows 
from DNA to RNA to 
protein.
Transcription 
and RNA 
Processing
(A) 
Incorrect. The structure is formed by DNA, not RNA, so it would not be 
bound by ribosomes.
(B) 
Incorrect. Translation occurs with RNA, not DNA.
(C) 
Correct. The formation of a triple-strand structure prevents the binding 
of RNA polymerase, which requires a single strand to bind to.
(D) 
Incorrect. The insertion of extra triplets would affect the primary 
structure of the protein, except that, according to the information 
provided, the GAA triplets are in a noncoding portion of the FXN gene.
