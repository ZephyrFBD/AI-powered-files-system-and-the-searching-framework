erature change and the duration of the heat shock are critical. For 
optimal results, the tubes containing the cell suspensions must be taken directly from 
ice, placed into the water bath at 42Â°C (have a student monitor the temperature) for 50 
seconds, and returned immediately to the ice. The absence of the heat shock will result 
in a 10-fold decrease in transformants; 90 seconds of heat shock will give about half as 
many transformants as will 50 seconds of heat shock. 
About one percent of bacterial cells can be transformed under laboratory conditions. 
Factors affecting transformation efficiency include the size of the bacterial colony used, 
the amount of plasmid used, technique, and incubation times. Some E. coli strains are 
more susceptible to transformation than others due to the composition of the cell wall.

To improve transformation efficiency, one recommendation is to have students plate 10
