h then combine to restore the diploid (2n) number during fertilization.
female gamete (n) + male gamete (n) = zygote (2n)
When it comes to genetic variation, meiosis is a big plus. Variation, in fact, is the driving force of evolution. The
more variation there is in a population, the more likely it is that some members of the population will survive
extreme changes in the environment. Meiosis is far more likely to produce these sorts of variations than is mitosis,
which therefore confers selective advantage on sexually reproducing organisms. Weâ€™ll come back to this theme in
Chapter 10.
A Closer Look at Meiosis
Meiosis actually involves two rounds of cell division: meiosis I and meiosis II.
Before meiosis begins, the diploid cell goes through interphase. Just as in mitosis, double-stranded chromosomes are
formed during S phase.
Meiosis I
Meiosis I consists of four stages: prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I. Meiosis I ensures that each
gamete receives a haploid (1n) set
