ncreases. Thus, the higher the concen-
tration of CFCs in the stratosphere, the faster the destruction of the ozone layer. Even 
though troposphere-to-stratosphere diffusion rates are slow, a substantial thinning of 
the ozone layer over the South Pole has been observed, particularly during September 
and October (Figure 18.7).

Total ozone (Dobson units)
▲ Figure 18.7 Ozone present in the Southern 
Hemisphere, September 24, 2006. The 
data were taken from an orbiting satellite. 
This day had the lowest stratospheric ozone 
concentration yet recorded. One “Dobson 
unit” corresponds to 2.69 × 1016 ozone 
molecules in a 1 cm2 column of atmosphere.
Give It Some Thought
Since the rate of ozone destruction depends on [Cl], can Cl be considered a 
catalyst for the reaction of Equation 18.10?
