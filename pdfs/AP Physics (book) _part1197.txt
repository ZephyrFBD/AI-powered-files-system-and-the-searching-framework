ut from the source in all directions, it is a three-dimensional
wave. Examples are sound traveling in open air, earthquake waves, and light waves.
If the medium is isotropic (same in all directions), the wave is a spherical wave
(Fig. 11–31). As the wave moves outward, the energy it carries is spread over 
a larger and larger area since the surface area of a sphere of radius r is
Thus the intensity of a spherical wave is
[spherical wave] (11;16a)
If the power output P of the source is constant, then the intensity decreases as
the inverse square of the distance from the source:
[spherical wave] (11;16b)
This is often called the inverse square law, or the “one over 
law.” If we consider
two points at distances 
and 
from the source, as in Fig. 11–31, then
and
so
[spherical wave] (11;16c)
Thus, for example, when the distance doubles
the intensity is reduced
to 
its earlier value:
The amplitude of a wave also decreases with distance. Since the intensity is
proportional to the square of the
