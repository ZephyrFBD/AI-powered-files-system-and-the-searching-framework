he infective rate and the proportion 
of susceptible people are changing with time. It can predict future trend at 
a nature spread of disease, including the proportion that the patients will 
reach. Due to the use of the method of data fitting, the margin of error is 
small. To sum up, this model is simple, accurate and practical. 
 Weakness: This model just applies to the nature spread, it is more suitable 
for natural environment without the external factors. But in fact, we would

face more complex problems, such as isolation and medical cure. Under 
these circumstances, we can’t use this model, that’s what we need to 
improve in the next models.

Improved Model Ⅰ( Spread Model considering vaccines) 
3.2.1 Additional Assumptions 
1) We divide people into 3 types, including susceptible people, infective 
people and dead, cured or vaccinated people. 
2) θ will change with t, and the co
