urrent is applied to the gel, and smaller
pieces of DNA will move farther away from the location where the nucleus was placed. These smaller pieces
of DNA form the “tail,” and the nucleus forms the “head” of the “comet.” Longer tails indicate greater amounts
of DNA damage.
(a) Explain why DNA fragments will move through an agarose gel when an electric current is applied.
(b) List and describe two things that could damage DNA and result in longer tails on the comet assay.
(c) Two cells are treated with a known mutagen of DNA. Cell A has two functional p53 alleles (p53 is
involved in DNA repair). Cell B has one functional p53 allele, and its second p53 allele is nonfunctional.
On the two templates provided, construct a visual representation of the comet assay results for these two
cells.
(d) Explain the visual representations you created on the two templates in part (c).
