t in the
spaceship.
(b) By checking your precision watch. If it’s running slow,
then the ship is moving.
(c) By measuring the lengths of objects in the spaceship. If
they are shortened, then the ship is moving.
(d) Give up, because you can’t tell.
12. The period of a pendulum attached in a spaceship is 2 s
while the spaceship is parked on Earth. What is the period
to an observer on Earth when the spaceship moves at 0.6c
with respect to the Earth?
(a) Less than 2 s.
(b) More than 2 s.
(c) 2 s.
13. Two spaceships, each moving at a speed 0.75c relative to
the Earth, are headed directly toward each other. What do
occupants of one ship measure the speed of other ship to be?
(a) 0.96c.
(b) 1.0c.
(c) 1.5c.
(d) 1.75c.
(e) 0.75c.
