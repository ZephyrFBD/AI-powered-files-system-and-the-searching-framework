harge distribution is distorted is called the molecule’s polarizability. We can think 
of the polarizability of a molecule as a measure of the “squashiness” of its electron cloud: 
The greater the polarizability, the more easily the electron cloud can be distorted to give an 
instantaneous dipole. Therefore, more polarizable molecules have larger dispersion forces.
In general, polarizability increases as the number of electrons in an atom or molecule 
increases. The strength of dispersion forces therefore tends to increase with increasing 
atomic or molecular size. Because molecular size and mass generally parallel each other, 
dispersion forces tend to increase in strength with increasing molecular weight. We can see this
