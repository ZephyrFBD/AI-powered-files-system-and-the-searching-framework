The explosion of a supernova in the outer parts of our Galaxy in 1987 
(Section 33–2) released lots of neutrinos and offered an opportunity to estimate
electron neutrino mass. If neutrinos do have mass, then their speed would be less
than c, and neutrinos of different energy would take different times to travel the
170,000 light-years from the supernova to Earth. To get an idea of how such a
measurement could be done, suppose two neutrinos from “SN1987A” were 
emitted at the same time and were actually detected on Earth (via the reaction
) 10 seconds apart, with measured kinetic energies of about
20 MeV and 10 MeV. From other laboratory measurements we expect the neutrino
mass to be less than 100 eV; and since our neutrinos have kinetic energy of 20 MeV
and 10 MeV, we can make the approximation 
so that E (the total
energy) is essentially equal to the kinetic energy. We use Eq. 26–6b, which tells us
We solve this for v, the velocity of a neutrino with energy E:
where we have used the
