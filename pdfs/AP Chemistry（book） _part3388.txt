 
fog a film that is sensitive to X rays?
The film strip is white 
before exposure to 
radiation.
The film strip is 
darkened on exposure 
to radiation.
▲ Figure 21.8 Badge dosimeters monitor the extent to which the individual has been exposed to 
high-energy radiation. The radiation dose is determined from the extent of darkening of the film 
in the dosimeter.
21.5 ∣ Detection of Radioactivity
A variety of methods have been devised to detect emissions from radioactive sub-
stances. Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity because radiation caused fogging of 
photographic plates, and since that time photographic plates and film have been used 
to detect radioactivity. The radiation affects photographic film in much the same way 
as X-rays do. The greater the extent of exposure to radiation, the darker the area of the 
developed negative. People who work with radioactive substances carry film badges to 
record the extent of their exposure to radiation (Figure 21.8).
