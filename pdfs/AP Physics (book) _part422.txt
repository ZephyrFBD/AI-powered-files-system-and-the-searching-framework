by a rope in
which there is 163 N of tension at a given instant. What is
the acceleration of the bucket? Is it up or down?
13. (II) A 75-kg petty thief wants to escape from a third-story jail
window. Unfortunately, a makeshift rope made of sheets tied
together can support a mass of only 58 kg. How might the
thief use this “rope” to escape? Give a quantitative answer.
14. (II) An elevator (mass 4850 kg) is to be designed so that
the maximum acceleration is 0.0680g. What are the maxi-
mum and minimum forces the motor should exert on the
supporting cable?
15. (II) Can cars “stop on a dime”? Calculate the acceleration
of a 1400-kg car if it can stop from 
on a dime
(
). How many g’s is this? What is the
force felt by the 68-kg occupant of the car?
16. (II) A woman stands on a bathroom scale in a motionless
elevator. When the elevator begins to move, the scale briefly
reads only 0.75 of her regular weight. Calculate the acceler-
ation of the elevator, and find the direction of acceleration.
