 3.15 violet flowers per one white
flower, or approximately 3:1. When Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with
white flowers and vice versa, he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent, male or female, contributed which
trait. This is called a reciprocal cross—a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross
become the respective traits of the female and male in the other cross. For the other six characteristics Mendel examined,
the F1 and F2 generations behaved in the same way as they had for flower color. One of the two traits would disappear
completely from the F1 generation only to reappear in the F2 generation at a ratio of approximately 3:1 (Table 12.1).
