he introduction
or deletion of bases often results in a change in the sequence of codons used by the ribosome (called a
frameshift mutation) to synthesize a polyprotein.
Example:
Original DNA Sequence: ATG, TAT, AAA, CAT, TGA
Original Polyprotein: Met, Tyr, Lys, His, Stop
DNA Sequence after Insertion: ATG, CTA, TAA, ACA, TTG, A
Polyprotein Sequence after Insertion: Met, Leu, Stop, -, -
In this example, the insertion of an additional cytosine nucleotide resulted in a frameshift and a premature stop
codon.
2. Duplications can result in an extra copy of genes and are usually caused by unequal crossing-over during
meiosis or chromosome rearrangements. This may result in new traits because one copy of the gene can
maintain the original function and the other copy may evolve a new function.
3. Inversions can result when changes occur in the orientation of chromosomal regions. This may cause harmful
effects if the inversion involves a gene or an important regulatory sequence.
