d viruses; these changes mean that the viral proteins that interact with cell-surface receptors
may evolve in such a way that they can bind to receptors in a new host. Such changes happen randomly
and quite often in the reproductive cycle of a virus, but the changes only matter if a virus with new binding
properties comes into contact with a suitable host. In the case of influenza, this situation can occur in
settings where animals and people are in close contact, such as poultry and swine farms. [1] Once a virus
jumps to a new host, it can spread quickly. Scientists watch newly appearing viruses (called emerging
viruses) closely in the hope that such monitoring can reduce the likelihood of global viral epidemics.
What requirements must be met for a new virus to emerge and spread?
a.
The virus must infect at least two different animals before infecting humans.
b.
The virus must come into contact with a new host so mutations will occur which allow the virus to bind to
that host.
c.
A mu
