producers. The herbivores, then, use that energy
for respiration (and other activities necessary for life), and the remainder is used for growth, increasing biomass.
Each successive tier above the herbivores, that is, the secondary and tertiary consumers, repeat the process, using the
energy in the biomass of tiers below them to provide for respiration and growth.
Ecological efficiency describes the proportion of energy represented at one trophic level that is transferred to the
next level. The relative sizes of tiers in an energy pyramid (or pyramid of productivity) indicate the ecological
efficiency of the ecosystem. On average, the efficiency is only about 10%, that is, about 10% of the productivity of
one trophic level is transferred to the next level. The remaining 90% is consumed by the individual metabolic
activities of each plant or animal, or is transferred to detritivores when they die.
It is important to note that much of the energy for respiration and other metabolic activi
