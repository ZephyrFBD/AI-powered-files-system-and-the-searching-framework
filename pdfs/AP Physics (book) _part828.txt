Now let us consider a rotating rigid object, such as a wheel rotating about a
fixed axis (an axle) through its center. We can think of the wheel as consist-
ing of many particles located at various distances from the axis of rotation.
We can apply Eq. 8–11 to each particle of the object, and then sum over all the
particles. The sum of the various torques is the net torque,
so we obtain:
(8;12)
where we factored out 
because it is the same for all the particles of a rigid
object.
