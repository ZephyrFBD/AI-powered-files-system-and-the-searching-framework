 the lungs by negative pressure.
The medulla in the brain, which contains the breathing control center,
sets the rhythm of breathing and monitors CO2 levels in the blood by
sensing changes in the pH of the blood. CO2, the by-product of cell
respiration, dissolves in blood to form carbonic acid. Therefore, the
higher the CO2 concentration in the blood, the lower the pH. Blood pH
lower than 7.4 causes the medulla to increase the rate of breathing to rid
the body of more CO2.

The body is also sensitive to low O2 levels but to a much lesser degree.
O2 sensors—chemoreceptors—are located in the nodes of neural tissue in
the aorta and carotid arteries leaving the heart. If O2 levels drop
drastically, these chemoreceptors become activated and send nerve
impulses to the medulla.
