In humans, multiple variations of the gene occur on two separate chromosomes.
Antifreeze genes. In certain arctic fish, glycoproteins in the blood provide resistance to freezing. The genes for
these glycoproteins appear to be the result of multiple duplications and divergence of the gene that codes for
trypsinogen, an enzyme whose activated form, trypsin, digests proteins in the small intestine. This illustrates how
novel genes can originate from gene duplication of genes originally used for a totally different purpose.
3. Inversions occur when a DNA segment is reversed. Depending upon
where the chromosome breaks occur, the mutation may or may not have a significant effect.
4. Translocations occur when segments of the chromosome are deleted and inserted elsewhere, either within the
same chromosome or in another chromosome. For example, one form of Down syndrome occurs when a piece of
chromosome 21 is translocated to chromosome 14. Offspring who inherit this chromosome 14 along with the
