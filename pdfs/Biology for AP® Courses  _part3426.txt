57. Cellular activity can vary based on sensitivity to
hormones, and cellular activity can therefore either be up-
regulated or down-regulated by those hormones. What
would likely cause a greater response from cells that are
controlled by a hormone?
a.
hormone levels increase and the number of
target cell receptors increase
b.
hormone levels decrease and the number of
target cell receptors increase
c.
hormone levels increase and the number of
target cell receptors decrease
d.
hormone levels decrease and the number of
target cell receptors decrease
58. Determine what kind of hormone is undergoing
binding in this figure and explain how you know.

a.
A lipid-derived hormone because it is fat
insoluble and therefore able to bind to receptors
on the outer surface of the plasma membrane.
