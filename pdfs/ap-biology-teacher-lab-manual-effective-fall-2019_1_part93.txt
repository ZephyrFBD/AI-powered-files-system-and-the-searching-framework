opted and adapted 
activities that help students visualize relationships are (1) looking at the spread of a 
disease, such as the West Nile virus arriving in New York City and then spreading across 
the nation over the course of a few years (the data are available from the Center for 
Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia); (2) noting the rate of neonatal infant mortality

stained images and tools). 
Another important skill is ordering, such as understanding the
