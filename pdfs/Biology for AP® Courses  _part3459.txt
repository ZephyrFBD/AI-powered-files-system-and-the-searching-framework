ion the arms on the body. The clavicles lie horizontally across the front of the
thorax (chest) just above the first rib. These bones are fairly fragile and are susceptible to fractures. For example, a fall
with the arms outstretched causes the force to be transmitted to the clavicles, which can break if the force is excessive. The
clavicle articulates with the sternum and the scapula.
The scapulae are flat, triangular bones that are located at the back of the pectoral girdle. They support the muscles crossing
the shoulder joint. A ridge, called the spine, runs across the back of the scapula and can easily be felt through the skin
(Figure 29.11). The spine of the scapula is a good example of a bony protrusion that facilitates a broad area of attachment
for muscles to bone.
The Upper Limb
The upper limb contains 30 bones in three regions: the arm (shoulder to elbow), the forearm (ulna and radius), and the wrist
and hand (Figure 29.12).
