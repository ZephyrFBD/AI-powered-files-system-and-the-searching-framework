field induces an emf in the coil (Fig. 22–18b). A satellite dish
(Fig. 22–19) consists of a parabolic reflector that focuses the EM waves onto a
“horn,” similar to a concave mirror telescope (Fig. 25–22).

uning a station. Calculate the transmitting wavelength of
an FM radio station that transmits at 100.1 MHz.
APPROACH Radio is transmitted as an EM wave,
so the speed is
The wavelength is found from Eq. 22–4,
SOLUTION The carrier frequency is
so
NOTE The wavelengths of other FM signals (88 MHz to 108 MHz) ar
