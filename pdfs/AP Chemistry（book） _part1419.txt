in geometry is sp3 (Table 9.4). Two of the 
sp3 hybrid orbitals contain nonbonding pairs of electrons, and the 
other two are used to make bonds with the hydrogen atoms.

For which of the following molecules or ions does the follow-
ing description apply? “The bonding can be explained using 
a set of sp2 hybrid orbitals on the central atom, with one of 
the hybrid orbitals holding a nonbonding pair of electrons.”

9.6 ∣ Multiple Bonds
In the covalent bonds we have considered thus far, the electron density is concentrated 
along the line connecting the nuclei (the internuclear axis). The line joining the two nu-
clei passes through the middle of the o
