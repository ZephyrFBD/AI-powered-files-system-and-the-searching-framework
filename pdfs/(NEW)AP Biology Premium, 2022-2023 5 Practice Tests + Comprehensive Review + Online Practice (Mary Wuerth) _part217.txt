three ATPs. Each FADH2
that enters the electron transport chain can generate as many as two ATPs; this is because FADH2 has less potential
energy than NADH and enters the electron transport chain at a later point than NADH. Using the totals from
previous processes of cellular respiration (as presented in Table 9.5), the number of ATPs that can be generated by
oxidative phosphorylation can be calculated as follows:
Therefore, oxidative phosphorylation can generate 34 ATPs. Compare that to the net gain of two ATPs from
glycolysis and the yield of two ATPs from the Krebs cycle to see how much more productive oxidative
phosphorylation is with regard to ATP production! However, in living organisms, metabolic processes rarely work
with 100% efficiency. For example, some membranes may be “leaky,” and some protons may cross the inner
membrane of the mitochondria without going through ATP synthase. So actual yields from this process may vary.
