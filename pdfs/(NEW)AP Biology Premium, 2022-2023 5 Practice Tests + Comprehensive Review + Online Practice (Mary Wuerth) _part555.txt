 that follow cattle that are grazing. As the cattle graze, insects are disturbed and fly out of the
grass; the cattle egrets eat these insects.
â– Mutualism: Mutualistic relationships benefit both species. Oxpeckers are birds that eat the ticks and other
parasites from the backs of rhinos and zebras. Oxpeckers benefit from this food source, and the rhinos and
zebras benefit from the parasite removal.
These relationships among members of a community can be classified as positive (as in mutualism), negative
(parasitism), or neutral (commensalism). However, some interactions can be classified in multiple categories. For
example, mistletoe is a parasite on trees and negatively impacts the growth of the tree. Some bird species eat
mistletoe berries, so mistletoe provides a benefit to those birds. Some mistletoe species also provide habitats for
small animal species.
Biodiversity
Biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms in an ecosystem. Ecosystems that have greater biodiversity a
