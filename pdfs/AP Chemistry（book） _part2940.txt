Let us examine two more examples of green chemistry in action.
Hydroquinone, HO-C6H4-OH, is a common intermediate used to make poly-
mers. The standard industrial route to hydroquinone, used until recently, yields many 
by-products that are treated as waste:

Using the principles of green chemistry, researchers have improved this process. 
The new process for hydroquinone production uses a new starting material. Two of the 
by-products of the new reaction (shown in green) can be isolated and used to make the 
new starting material.

The new process is an example of “atom economy,” a phrase that means that a high per-
