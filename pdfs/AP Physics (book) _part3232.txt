There is an optimum separation of the atoms,
in Fig. 29–8, at which the energy
is lowest. This is the point of greatest stability for the hydrogen molecule, and 
is the average separation of atoms in the 
molecule. The depth of this 
“well” is the binding energy,† as shown. This is how much energy must be put 
into the system to separate the two atoms to infinity, where the 
For the
molecule, the binding energy is about 4.5 eV and
For many bonds, the potential-energy curve has the shape shown in Fig. 29–9.
There is still an optimum distance 
at which the molecule is stable. But when 
the atoms approach from a large distance, the force is initially repulsive rather than
attractive. The atoms thus do not form a bond spontaneously. Some additional
energy must be injected into the system to get
