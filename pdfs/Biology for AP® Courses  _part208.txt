dioxide gas and exhaled through the lungs. This prevents too many free hydrogen ions from building up in the blood and
dangerously reducing the blood’s pH. Likewise, if too much OH– is introduced into the system, carbonic acid will combine
with it to create bicarbonate, lowering the pH. Without this buffer system, the body’s pH would fluctuate enough to put
survival in jeopardy.
Figure 2.21 This diagram shows the body’s buffering of blood pH levels. The blue arrows show the process of raising
pH as more CO2 is made. The purple arrows indicate the reverse process: the lowering of pH as more bicarbonate is
created.
Other examples of buffers are antacids used to combat excess stomach acid. Many of these over-the-counter medications
work in the same way as blood buffers, usually with at least one ion capable of absorbing hydrogen and moderating pH,
bringing relief to those that suffer “heartburn” after eating. The unique properties of water that contribute to this capacity to
balance pH—as
