Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension
C A U T I O N
Quadratic equations have two
solutions. Sometimes only one
corresponds to reality,
sometimes both
C A U T I O N
(1) Velocity and acceleration are 
not always in the same direction;
the acceleration (of gravity) always
points down
(2)
even at the highest point 
of a trajectory
a Z 0
Two possible misconceptions. Give
examples to show the error in these two common misconceptions: (1) that
acceleration and velocity are always in the same direction, and (2) that 
an object thrown upward has zero acceleration at the highest point (B in 
Fig. 2–23).
RESPONSE Both are wrong. (1) Velocity and acceleration are not necessarily
in the same direction. When the ball in Fig. 2–23 is moving upward, its
velocity
