Figure 1. Simplified starch biosynthesis pathway in plants
7. A rice grain is a fruit that encloses a seed. Most of the dry mass of a rice grain is starch. In rice plants, starch is 
produced by hydrolyzing sucrose and then linking the released glucose molecules together into starch (Figure 1). 
The optimal temperature range for starch synthase activity in a particular strain of rice is 27°C–30°C. The 
optimal temperature range for sucrose synthase in the strain is 30°C–35°C. 
Describe how temperatures above 35°C most likely affect the structure and function of the starch synthase in 
the particular strain. Using
