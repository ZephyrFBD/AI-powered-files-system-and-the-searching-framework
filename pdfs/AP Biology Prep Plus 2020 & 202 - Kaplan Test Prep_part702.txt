ividuals observed to have a specific
phenotype and e is the number of individuals expected to have that
particular phenotype.
All of this mathematical problem solving might seem intimidating, but it
is essential for real-world biology practice and for the AP Biology exam.
You can take a deep breath, though; all of these formulas will be provided
to you on your exam. You will not be required to memorize these
equations and formulas.
AP Biology Lab 2:
Mathematical Modeling:
Hardy-Weinberg
Investigation
This lab is easy to perform, but it causes confusion for some students
because it involves quantitative and analytical skills. In this investigation,
you will develop a mathematical model to investigate the relationship
between allele frequencies in populations of organisms. You will use a
spreadsheet to build a model based on the Hardy-Weinberg relationship
to determine how allele frequencies change from one generation to the
next. This model will help you to see how selection, mutation,
