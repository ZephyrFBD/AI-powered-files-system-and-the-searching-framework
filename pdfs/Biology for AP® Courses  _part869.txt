KEY TERMS
combination of an acetyl group derived from pyruvic acid and coenzyme A, which is made from pantothenic
acid (a B-group vitamin)
process in which organisms convert energy in the presence of oxygen
process that does not use oxygen
process in which organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen
(also, F1F0 ATP synthase) membrane-embedded protein complex that adds a phosphate to ADP with
energy from protons diffusing through it
process in which there is a production of adenosin
