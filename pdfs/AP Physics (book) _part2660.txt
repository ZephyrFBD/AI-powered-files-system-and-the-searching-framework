ecause they will be 
out
of phase. However, light from the top third of the slit will still reach the screen,
so there will be a bright spot (or fringe) centered near
but it will
not be nearly as bright as the central spot at
For an even larger angle 
such that the top ray travels 
farther than the bottom ray, Fig. 24–20d, rays
from the bottom quarter of the slit will cancel with those in the quarter just 
above it because the path lengths differ by 
And the rays through the quarter
of the slit just above center will cancel with those through the top quarter. At this
angle there will again be a minimum of zero intensity in the diffraction pattern.

A plot of the intensity as a function of angle is shown in Fig. 24–21. This corre-
