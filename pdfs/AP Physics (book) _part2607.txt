action; Snell’s Law
28. (I) A flashlight beam strikes the surface of a pane of glass
at a 67° angle to the normal. What is the angle
of refraction?
29. (I) A diver shines a flashlight upward from beneath the
water at a 35.2° angle to the vertical. At what angle does
the light leave the water?
30. (I) A light beam coming from an underwater spotlight
exits the water at an angle of 56.0°. At what angle of
incidence did it hit the air–water interface from below the
surface?
31. (I) Rays of the Sun are seen to make a 36.0° angle to the
vertical beneath the water. At what angle above the horizon
is the Sun?
32. (II) An aquarium filled with water has flat glass sides whose
index of refraction is 1.54. A beam of light from outside
the aquarium strikes the glass at a 43.5° angle to the
perpendicular (Fig. 23–56). What is the angle of this light
ray when it enters (a) the glass, and
then (b) the water? (c) What would be
the refracted angle if the ray entered
the water directly?
