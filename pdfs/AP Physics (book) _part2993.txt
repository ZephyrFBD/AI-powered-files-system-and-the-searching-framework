athode rays (Eq. 20–4). In the absence of an electric field, the
rays are bent into a curved path, and applying Newton’s second law 
with
acceleration gives
and thus
The radius of curvature r can be measured and so can B. The velocity v can be
found by applying an electric field in addition to the magnetic field. The electric

field E is adjusted so that the cathode rays are undeflected and follow path b in
Fig. 27–2. In this situation the upward force due to the electric field,
is
balanced by the downward force due to the magnetic field,
We equate
the two forces,
and find
Combining this with the above equation we have
(27;1)
The quantities on the right side can all be measured, and although e and m could
not be determined separately, the ratio 
could be determined. The accepted
value today is 
Cathode rays soon came to be called
electrons.

The “discovery” of the electron, like many others in science, is no
