53. (C) Keystone species have a disproportionally large effect on their environment relative to their abundance.
When the sea otter populations declined in numbers, the biodiversity of the entire ecosystem was affected, so
sea otters are a keystone species in this ecosystem. Autotrophs produce their own nutrition, usually through
photosynthesis. Sea otters are not autotrophs, so choice (A) is incorrect. Detritivores eat dead organic material,
allowing nutrients to be recycled through the ecosystem. This description does not match the role of sea otters in
the question, so choice (B) is in
