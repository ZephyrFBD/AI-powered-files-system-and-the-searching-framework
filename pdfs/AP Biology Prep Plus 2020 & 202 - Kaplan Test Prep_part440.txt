molecule of glucose. (C) is incorrect because neither lactic
acid fermentation nor mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
consumes ATP. (D) is incorrect because although oxygen is present, it is
not consumed in aerobic glycolysis.
6. B
Learning Objective:Â 10.7
During anaerobic respiration in yeast (alcoholic fermentation),
glycolysis breaks down glucose into pyruvate, which is then converted
to carbon dioxide and ethanol. Thus, increasing the amount of
pyruvate would, in turn, increase the amount of carbon dioxide and
ethanol produced. (B) is the appropriate match. (A) is incorrect
because pyruvate is oxidized under aerobic conditions and lactic acid
is not a product of yeast fermentation. Although (C) is factually true, it
does not explain why the solution with sodium fluoride and pyruvate
increased respiration, and therefore is incorrect. (D) is incorrect
because, according to the data, sodium fluoride does not promote
aerobic respiration and also because aerobic respiration would
