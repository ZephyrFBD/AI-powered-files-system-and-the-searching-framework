on is produced by an
electron–atom interaction, and ray if the photon is produced in a nuclear process.
Isomers; Internal Conversion
In some cases, a nucleus may remain in an excited state for some time before it
emits a 
ray. The nucleus is then said to be in a metastable state and is called an
isomer.
An excited nucleus can sometimes return to the ground state by another
process known as internal conversion with no 
ray emitted. In this process, the
excited nucleus interacts with one of the orbital electrons and ejects this electron
from the atom with the same kinetic energy (minus the binding energy of the
electron) that an emitted ray would have had.
30–7 Conservation of Nucleon Number
and Other Conservation Laws
In all three types of radioactive decay, the classical conservation laws hold.
Energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge are all
conserved. These quantities are the same before the decay as after. But a new
conservation law is also revealed, the law of
