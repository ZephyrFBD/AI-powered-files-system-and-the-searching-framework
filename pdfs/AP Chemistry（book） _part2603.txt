 more than 105 times larger than Ka for HPO4
2-; 
thus, the reaction in Equation 16.47 predominates over that in 
Equation 16.46, and the solution is basic.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
How many of the following salts are expected to 
produce acidic solutions (see Table 16.3 for data): 
NaHSO4, NaHC2O4, NaH2PO4, and NaHCO3?
(a) 0 (b) 1 (c) 2 (d) 3 (e) 4
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Predict whether the dipotassium salt of citric acid 
1K2HC6H5O72 forms an acidic or basic solution in water (see 
Table 16.3 for data).

Acid–Base Behavior  
and Chemical Structure
When a substance is dissolved in water, it may behave as an acid or a base, or exhibit no 
acid–base properties. How does the chemical structure of a substance determine which 
of these behaviors is exhibited by the substance? For example, why do some substances 
that contain OH groups behave as bases, releasing OH- ions into solution, whereas oth-
ers behave as acids, ionizing to release H+ ions? In this section we discuss briefly t
