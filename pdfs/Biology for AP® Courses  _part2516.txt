ns from water. Mercury is an example of a toxic metal that can be removed from an environment by bioremediation.
As an active ingredient of some pesticides, mercury is used in industry and is also a by-product of certain processes,
such as battery production. Methyl mercury is usually present in very low concentrations in natural environments, but it
is highly toxic because it accumulates in living tissues. Several species of bacteria can carry out the biotransformation of
toxic mercury into nontoxic forms. These bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, can convert Hg+2 into Hg0, which is
nontoxic to humans.
One of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the cleanup of
oil spills. The importance of prokaryotes to petroleum bioremediation has been demonstrated in several oil spills in recent
years, such as the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska (1989) (Figure 22.28), the Prestige oil spill in Spain (2002), the spill into
the Mediterra
