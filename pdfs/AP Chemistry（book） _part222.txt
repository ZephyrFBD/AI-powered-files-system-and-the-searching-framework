  A solid white substance A is heated strongly in the absence of 
air. It decomposes to form a new white substance B and a gas C. 
The gas has exactly the same properties as the product ob-
tained when carbon is burned in an excess of oxygen. Based 
on these observations, can we determine whether solids A 
and B and gas C are elements or compounds?
 1.18  You are hiking in the mountains and find a shiny gold nug-
get. It might be the element gold, or it might be “fool’s gold,” 
which is a nickname for iron pyrite, FeS2. Which of the fol-
lowing physical properties do you think would help deter-
mine if the shiny nugget is really gold—appearance, melting 
point, density, or physical state?
 1.19  In the process of attempting to characterize a substance, a 
chemist makes the following observations: The substance is 
a silvery white, lustrous metal. It melts at 649 °C and boils at 
1105 °C. Its density at 20 °C is 1.738 g>cm3. The substance 
burns in air, producing an intense white light.
