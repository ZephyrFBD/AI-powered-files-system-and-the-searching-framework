A kicked football. A kicked football leaves the ground at
an angle  
with a velocity of 
as shown in Fig. 3–23. Calculate
(a) the maximum height, (b) the time of travel before the football hits the ground,
and (c) how far away it hits the ground. Assume the ball leaves the foot at ground
level, and ignore air resistance and rotation of the ball.
APPROACH This may seem difficult at first because there are so many questions.
But we can deal with them one at a time. We take the y direction as positive
upward, and treat the x and y motions separately. The total time in the air is again
determined by the y motion. The x motion occurs at constant velocity. The y com-
ponent of velocity varies, being positive (upward) initially, decreasing to zero at
the highest point, and then becoming negative as the football falls.
SOLUTION We resolve the initial velocity into its components (Fig. 3–23):
(a) To find the maximum height, we consider a time interval that beg
