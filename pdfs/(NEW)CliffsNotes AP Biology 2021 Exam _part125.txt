lysis
2. Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle)
3. Oxidative phosphorylation
When oxygen is not available, cells will generate ATP by anaerobic respiration. There are two slightly different
pathways for this process:
1. Alcohol fermentation
2. Lactic acid fermentation
Each of these processes is discussed in detail in the following section. Refer to Figure 4-3. In addition to obtaining
free energy directly from glucose, other carbohydrates, such as starch and glycogen, can be hydrolyzed to glucose,
and sucrose can be hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose. So they all end up being glucose or fructose and enter the
glycolytic (glycolysis) pathway.
Proteins can also be a source of free energy. Proteins that are eaten are digested to amino acids before they are
absorbed into the bloodstream. Body proteins, if necessary, can be hydrolyzed to amino acids. Amino
groups (âˆ’NH2) are first stripped from the amino acids and then excreted as
waste. The remainders of the amino acids are then enzymatically conv
