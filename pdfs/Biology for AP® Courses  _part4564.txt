used to justify or refute the claim.
c.
Collect data on number of trout in the stream
after the introduction of logging, which will give
an indication as to whether the claim is justified
or not.
d.
Collect data on the number of trout in the stream

94. Predict how human population change in the next 50
years is likely to affect marine ecosystems.
a.
Humans will decrease their own carrying
capacity, which will also decrease the carrying
capacities of marine ecosystems.
b.
Decreased fishing can be expected, which will
lead to rebounds in fish populations and
healthier marine ecosystems.
c.
Increases in greenhouse gas emissions are likely,
with increases in ocean temperatures that trigger
shifts in marine populations.
d.
Biodiversity of marine ecosystems will increase
as humans use engineering to increase food
production in the oceans.
