meters (in radians) of the Sun and the Moon, as seen
from Earth, and then comment.
3. Two uniform spheres simultaneously start rolling (from rest)
down an incline. One sphere has twice the radius and twice
the mass of the other. (a) Which reaches the bottom of the
incline first? (b) Which has the greater speed there? (c) Which
has the greater total kinetic energy at the bottom? Explain
your answers.
4. A bicyclist traveling with speed 
on a flat road
is making a turn with a radius 
There are three
forces acting on the cyclist and cycle: the normal force 
and
friction force 
exerted by the road on the tires; and 
the total weight of the cyclist and cycle. Ignore the small
mass of the wheels. (a) Explain carefully why the angle 
the bicycle makes with the vertical (Fig. 8–68) must be
given by 
if the cyclist is to maintain balance.
(b) Calculate 
for the values given. [Hint: Consider the
“circular” translational motion of the bicycle and rider.]
(c) If the coefficient of static friction
