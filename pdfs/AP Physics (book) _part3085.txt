increase.
(b) The maximum intensity increases, and the peak
wavelength decreases.
(c) Both the maximum intensity and the peak wavelength
decrease.
(d) The maximum intensity decreases, and the peak
wavelength increases.
2. As red light shines on a piece of metal, no electrons are
released. When the red light is slowly changed to shorter-
wavelength light (basically progressing through the rainbow),
nothing happens until yellow light shines on the metal, at
which point electrons are released from the metal. If this
metal is replaced with a metal having a higher work function,
which light would have the best chance of releasing elec-
trons from the metal?
(a) Blue.
(b) Red.
(c) Yellow would still work fine.
(d) We need to know more about the metals involved.
3. A beam of red light and a beam of blue light have equal
intensities. Which statement is true?
(a) There are more photons in the blue beam.
(b) There are more photons in the red beam.
(c) Both beams contain the same number
