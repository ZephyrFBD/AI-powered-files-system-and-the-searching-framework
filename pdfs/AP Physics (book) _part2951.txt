
total energy E and momentum p of a particle will be different in different
reference frames, but the quantity 
will have the same value in all
inertial reference frames. We say that the quantity 
is invariant.
When Do We Use Relativistic Formulas?
From a practical point of view, we do not have much opportunity in our daily lives
to use the mathematics of relativity. For example, the factor,
,
has a value of 1.005 when 
Thus, for speeds even as high as
the factor 
in relativistic formulas gives
a numerical correction of less than 1%. For speeds less than 0.10c, or unless 
mass and energy are interchanged, we donâ€™t usually need the more complicated
relativistic formulas, and can use the simpler classical formulas.
