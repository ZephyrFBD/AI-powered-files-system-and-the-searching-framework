nvolved in the process. The very inside of a thylakoid is
called the thylakoid lumen.
Many light-absorbing pigments participate in photosynthesis. Some of the more important ones are chlorophyll a,
chlorophyll b, and carotenoids. These pigments are clustered in the thylakoid membrane into units called antenna
complexes.
All of the pigments within a unit are able to “gather” light, but they’re not able to “excite” electrons. Only one
special molecule—located in the reaction center—is capable of transforming light energy to chemical energy. In
other words, the other pigments, called antenna pigments, “gather” light and “bounce” energy to the reaction
center.
There are two types of reaction centers: photosystem I (PS I) and photosystem II (PS II). The principal difference
between the two is that each reaction center has a specific type of chlorophyll—chlorophyll a—that absorbs a
particular wavelength of light. For example, P680, the reaction center of photosystem II, has a maximum absorpt
