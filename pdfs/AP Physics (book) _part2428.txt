defined as the ratio of the voltage across the capacitor
(or inductor) to the voltage across the resistor, at resonance.
The larger the Q factor, the sharper the resonance curve will
be and the sharper the tuning. (a) Show that the Q factor
is given by the equation 
(b) At a reso-
nant frequency 
what must be the values 
of L and R to produce a Q factor of 650? Assume that
C = 0.010 mF.
f
0 = 1.0 MHz,
Q = (1R)2LC.
*90. A 130-mH coil whose resistance is 
is connected to a
capacitor C and a 1360-Hz source voltage. If the current
and voltage are to be in phase, what value must C have?
*91. The wire of a tightly wound solenoid is unwound and 
used to make another tightly wound solenoid of twice the
diameter. By what factor does the inductance change?

1. (a) Sections 19–7 and 21–9 discuss conditions when and
where it is especially important to have ground fault circuit
interrupters (GFCIs) installed. What is it about those places
that makes “touching ground” especially risky? (b) D
