Figure 18.24 After speciation has occurred, the two separate but closely related species may continue to
produce offspring in an area called the hybrid zone. Reinforcement, fusion, or stability may result, depending on
reproductive barriers and the relative fitness of the hybrids.
What are three different pathways that species evolution may take in hybrid zones?
a.
stability, fusion, reinforcement
b.
allopatric speciation, sympatric speciation, fusion
c.
convergent evolution, divergent evolution, no evolution
d.
natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow
Hybrids can be either less fit than the parents, more fit, or about the same. Usually hybrids tend to be less fit; therefore, such
reproduction diminishes over time, nudging the two species to diverge further in a process called reinforcement. This term
is used because the low success of the hybrids reinforces the original speciation. If the hybrids are as fit or more fi
