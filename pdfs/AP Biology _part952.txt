had both AMPs.
Choice D is incorrect because the wild flies (line A on the graph) are
the control.
(A) Killifish do not eat guppies, but cichlids do. So cichlids were the
agent of selection. No organism or population changes in order to
survive. If individuals are not adapted, they die. No individual
changes during its lifetime. Rather, the frequency of a particular trait
in a population may change.
(D) The evolution in this population—the change in frequency of the
trait for brightly colored spots—occurred rapidly, within about 16
months. Evolution does not always require millions of years. The
rate of change is a function of the pressure from the environment to
change.
(C) The question does not give you enough background information
to determine anything more than that some traits are favored more
than others in a particular environment.
(D) Once again, the environment provides the direction for
evolutionary change. Tuna and sharks are fish; dolphins are
mammals. Fish and mammals do
