and 
flower-color genes resulted in chromosomes 
carrying a dominant allele of both genes. 
(B) Recombination between the broad and 
narrow alleles of the leaf-shape gene 
resulted in chromosomes carrying three 
different alleles at the same genetic locus. 
(C) Independent assortment of homologous 
chromosomes resulted in the combinations 
of alleles present in the parental generation. 
(D) The computer model cannot capture the 
possible assortments of gametes when 
multiple genes are considered.

33. When a stimulus is applied to a receptor in the 
skin, an action potential is propagated along  
a neuron to the brain, where another signal is  
sent back to the muscle for a response. 
Which of the following best describes what 
occurs when the action potential reaches  
a chemical synapse at the end of an axon? 
  
(A) The action potential jumps from one axon  
to the next c
