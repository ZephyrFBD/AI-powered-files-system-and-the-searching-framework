ulation. 
How else can you simplify the question? Consider that the population has an infinite 
gene pool (all the alleles in the population at this particular locus). Gametes for the next 
generation are selected totally at random. What does that mean? Focus on answering 
that question in your lab notebook for a moment — it is key to our model. For now let’s 
consider that our model is going to look only at how allele frequencies might change 
from generation to generation. To do that we need to describe the system. 
Step 3 Qualitatively describe the biological system. 
Imagine for a minute the life cycle of our hypothetical organism. See if you can draw a 
diagram of the cycle; be sure to include the life stages of the organism. Your life cycle 
might look like Figure 1.
