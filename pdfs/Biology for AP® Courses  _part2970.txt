, and chymotrypsin are produced by the pancreas and released into the duodenum where
they act on the chyme. Further breakdown of peptides to single amino acids is aided by enzymes called peptidases (those
that break down peptides). Specifically, carboxypeptidase, dipeptidase, and aminopeptidase play important roles in
reducing the peptides to free amino acids. The amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestines.
The steps in protein digestion are summarized in Figure 25.18 and Table 25.6.
