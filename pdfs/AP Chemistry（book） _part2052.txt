ial pressure of CO2 
and the value of the Henry’s law constant.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
You double the partial pressure of a gas over a liquid at con-
stant temperature. Which of these statements is then true?
(a) The Henry’s law constant is doubled.
(b) The Henry’s law constant is decreased by half.
(c) There are half as many gas molecules in the liquid.
(d) There are twice as many gas molecules in the liquid.
(e) There is no change in the number of gas molecules in the 
liquid.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Calculate the concentration of CO2 in a soft drink after the 
bottle is opened and the solution equilibrates at 25 °C under 
a CO2 partial pressure of 3.0 * 10-4 atm.
Temperature Effects
The solubility of most solid solutes in water increases as the solution temperature increases, 
as Figure 13.15 shows. There are exceptions to this rule, however, as seen for Ce21SO423, 
whose solubility curve slopes downward with increasing temperature.
In contrast to solid solutes, the solubility of gas
