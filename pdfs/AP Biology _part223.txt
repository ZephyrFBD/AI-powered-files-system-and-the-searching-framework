ycle. Process C represents oxidative phosphorylation. Process A
takes place in the cytoplasm. Process B releases NADH, not NAD+.
Process C consists of the electron transport chain plus
chemiosmosis. It produces the most ATP from cellular respiration.
(ENE-1)
(A) The ATP synthase molecules lie within the cristae membrane.
(ENE-1 & ENE-2)
(B) B represents the citric acid cycle. It is the inner matrix. (ENE-1 &
SYI-1)
(C) Glycolysis is carried out in the cytoplasm and does not rely on

internal membranes. It must have been the earliest mechanism by
which ATP was produced in the first organisms on Earth, which the
fossil record shows had no internal membranes. Choices A and B
refer to primitive cells, but they do not explain anything about
glycolysis. Also, yeast is aerobic as well as anaerobic. Choice D is
not correct because, although it refers to endosymbiosis (the theory
that mitochondria were once free-living cell
