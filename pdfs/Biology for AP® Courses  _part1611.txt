e called telomerase no longer functions.
Explain the function of telomerase in the development of
stem cells and cancer cells, and the inhibition of
telomerase in programmed cell death or apoptosis.
74. The mitochondria of eukaryote cells contain their own
circular DNA (mtDNA), consistent with their origin
according to the theory of endosymbiosis. The
mitochondrial genome is highly conserved in Eukarya. In
humans, the 50 to 100 mitochondria in each of the cells in
most tissues have 5 to 10 copies of the genome. Each has
37 genes that primarily encode proteins of the electron
transport chain. Point mutations in which a single
nucleotide is incorrectly placed is not repaired because the
error-checking provided by DNA polymerase is not
present in the mitochondria. The mutation rate for mtDNA
is approximately 100 times higher than the mutation rate
for nuclear DNA. The simultaneous existence of multiple
alleles in each cell is likely, a condition called
heteroplasmy. In mammals, sperm mito
