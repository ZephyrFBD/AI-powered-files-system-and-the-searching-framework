ctrophoresis. The sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA has a slightly negative charge and is attracted to the positive
charge of the anode in the gel electrophoresis apparatus. Smaller fragments of DNA will travel farther in the agarose
gel than longer fragments. The gel is stained with a dye that allows visualization of the DNA fragments, as shown in
Figure 24.10.

If the pattern of DNA fragments from the suspect does not match the pattern from the DNA found in evidence at
the crime scene, it is unlikely the individual was at the crime scene. However, if the pattern of DNA fragments does
match, it does not prove guilt; it just shows that there is a possibility that the suspect was at the crime scene.
If a DNA marker that contains fragments of known sizes is run along with the DNA samples, the size of the
DNA fragments in the other samples can be estimated. The distance migrated by the DNA marker fragments of
known sizes are plotted on the x-
