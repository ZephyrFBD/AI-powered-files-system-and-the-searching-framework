d through two mechanisms during the breakdown of glucose. A few ATP molecules are generated (that
is, regenerated from ADP) as a direct result of the chemical reactions that occur in the catabolic pathways. A phosphate
group is removed from an intermediate reactant in the pathway, and the free energy of the reaction is used to add the third
phosphate to an available ADP molecule, producing ATP (Figure 7.4). This very direct method of phosphorylation is called
substrate-level phosphorylation.
Figure 7.4 In phosphorylation reactions, the gamma phosphate of ATP is attached to a protein.
Oxidative Phosphorylation
Most of the ATP generated during glucose catabolism, however, is derived from a much more complex process,
chemiosmosis, which takes place in mitochondria (Figure 7.5) within a eukaryotic cell or the plasma membrane of a
prokaryotic cell. Chemiosmosis, a process of ATP production in cellular metabolism, is used to generate 90 percent of the
ATP made during glucose catabolism and i
