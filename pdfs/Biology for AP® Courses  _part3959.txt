ur constant domains per heavy chain. The variable domain determines binding specificity
and the constant domain of the heavy chain determines the immunological mechanism of action of the corresponding
antibody class. It is possible for two antibodies to have the same binding specificities but be in different classes and,
therefore, to be involved in different functions.
After an adaptive defense is produced against a pathogen, typically plasma cells first secrete IgM into the blood. BCRs on

na√Øve B cells are of the IgM class and occasionally IgD class. IgM molecules make up approximately ten percent of all
antibodies. Prior to antibody secretion, plasma cells assemble IgM molecules into pentamers (five individual antibodies)
linked by a joining (J) chain, as shown in Figure 33.23. The pentamer arrangement means that these macromolecules can
bind ten identical antigens. However, IgM molecules released early in the adaptive immune response do not bind
