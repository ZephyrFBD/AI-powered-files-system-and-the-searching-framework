 to the mitochondrial matrix due to
the “leaky” membrane. Thus the proton gradient, which is needed to
drive ATP production, is decreased, and energy is released as heat
instead of used for ATP production. Thus, the correct answer is (A).
This mechanism is used by hibernating animals to stay warm. (B) is
incorrect because decreasing the proton gradient would decrease ATP
production. (C) and (D) are incorrect because thermogenin decreases
the proton gradient.

During cellular respiration, cells break down glucose (C6H12O6) to
make ATP. The products (CO2 and H2O) have less energy than the
reactants, so the process is exergonic. During photosynthesis, plants
use sunlight to make glucose from carbon dioxide and water. The
products have more energy than the reactants, so the process is
endergonic. (D) appropriately matches each process to its change in
energy. (A) and (B) are incorrect because photosynthesis is not
exergonic and cellular respiration is not ender
