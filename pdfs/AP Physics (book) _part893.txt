an angular speed of 
61. (I) (a) What is the angular momentum of a 2.8-kg uniform
cylindrical grinding wheel of radius 28 cm when rotating at
1300 rpm? (b) How much torque is required to stop it in
6.0 s?

59. (III) A 1.80-m-long pole is balanced vertically with its tip
on the ground. It starts to fall and its lower end does not slip.
What will be the speed of the upper end of the pole just
before it hits the ground? [
