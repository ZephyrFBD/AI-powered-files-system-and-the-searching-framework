asured during the three-
day period using a potometer. At the end of the three-day period, the total surface area of the leaves of each
plant was measured, and the water loss per square meter of leaf area per day was calculated. Data are shown in
the table.
Plant Species
Mean Water Loss per Plant (mL/m2/day) ± 2 SEM*
A
15.4 ± 2.1
B
21.6 ± 2.8
C
25.0 ± 3.1

(a) Explain the relationship between transpiration and photosynthesis.
(b) On the axes provided, construct a graph of the data using 95% confidence intervals.
(c) Analyze the data to determine which, if any, plant species have a statistically significant difference
between the amounts of water loss.
(d) Predict which plant species would be best suited to a dry climate. Justify your prediction using the data
from the experiment.
