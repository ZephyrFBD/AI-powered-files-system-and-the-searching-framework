e ideally at low pressure than at 
high pressure.
1PV>RT = 12 is large and different for each gas. Real gases, in other words, do not behave ideally 
at high pressure. At lower pressures (usually below 10 atm), however, the deviation from ideal 
behavior is small, and we can use the ideal-gas equation without generating serious error.
Deviation from ideal behavior also depends on temperature. As temperature 
increases, the behavior of a real gas more nearly approaches that of the ideal gas 
 
(Figure 10.19). In general, the deviation from ideal behavior increases as temperature decreases, 
becoming significant near the temperature at which the gas liquefies.
The basic assumptions of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases give 
us insight into why real gases deviate from ideal behavior. The mol-
ecules of an ideal gas are assumed to occupy no space and have no 
attraction for one another. Real molecules, however, do have finite vol-
umes and do attract one another. As Figure 10.20 shows,
