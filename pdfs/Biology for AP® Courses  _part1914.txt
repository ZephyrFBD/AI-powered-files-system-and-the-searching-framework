Mitochondrial Genomics
Mitochondria are intracellular organelles that contain their own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA mutates at a rapid rate and is
often used to study evolutionary relationships. Another feature that makes studying the mitochondrial genome interesting is
that the mitochondrial DNA in most multicellular organisms is passed on from the mother during the process of fertilization.

For this reason, mitochondrial genomics is often used to trace genealogy.
Information and clues obtained from DNA samples found at crime scenes have been used as evidence in court cases, and
genetic markers have been used in forensic analysis. Genomic analysis has also become useful in this field. In 2001, the
first use of genomics in forensics was published. It was a collaborative attempt between academic research institutions
and the FBI to solve the mysterious cases of anthrax communicated via t
