ir is 4.3 ppm. What 
is the partial pressure of the CO if the total air pressure is 695 
torr?
The Sun emits radiant energy over a wide range of wavelengths (Figure 18.3). To 
understand the connection between the wavelength of radiation and its effect on atoms 
and molecules, recall that electromagnetic radiation can be pictured as a stream of pho-
tons. 
 (Section 6.2) The energy of each photon is given by E = hn, where h is Planck 
constant and n is the radiation frequency. For a chemical change to occur when radiation 
strikes atoms or molecules, two conditions must be met. First, the incoming photons 
must have sufficient energy to break a chemical bond or remove an electron from the 
atom or molecule. Second, the atoms or molecules being bombarded must absorb these 
photons. When these requirements are met, the energy of the photons is used to do the 
work associated with some chemical change.
