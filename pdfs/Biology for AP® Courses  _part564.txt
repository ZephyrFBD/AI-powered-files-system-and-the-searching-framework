f diffusion is the process of filtration. In filtration, material moves according to its concentration gradient
through a membrane; sometimes the rate of diffusion is enhanced by pressure, causing the substances to filter more rapidly.
This occurs in the kidney, where blood pressure forces large amounts of water and accompanying dissolved substances, or
solutes, out of the blood and into the renal tubules. The rate of diffusion in this instance is almost totally dependent on
pressure. One of the effects of high blood pressure is the appearance of protein in the urine, which is “squeezed through” by
the abnormally high pressure.
Facilitated transport
In facilitated transport, also called facilitated diffusion, materials diffuse across the plasma membrane with the help
of membrane proteins. A concentration gradient exists that would allow these materials to diffuse into the cell without
expending cellular energy. However, these materials are polar molecules that are repelled by the hydro
