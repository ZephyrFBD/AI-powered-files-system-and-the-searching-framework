Density is the number of individuals per unit area or volume. Counting the
number of organisms inhabiting a certain area is often very difficult, if not
impossible. For example, imagine trying to count the number of ants in 1
acre (0.5 ha) of land. Instead, scientists use sampling techniques to
estimate the number of organisms living in one area. One sampling
technique commonly used to estimate the size of a population is called
mark and recapture. In this technique, organisms are captured, tagged,
and then released. Some time later, the same process is repeated and the
following formula is used for the collected data,
N=(number marked in first catch)â€¢(total number in second
catch)number of recaptures in second catch
Suppose 50 zebra mussels are captured, marked, and released. One
week later, 100 zebra mussels are captured and 10 are found to have
markings already. When using the formula, the total population would be
about 500 zebra mussels.
