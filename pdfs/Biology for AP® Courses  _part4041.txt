in a small area, enhancing
the possibility of fertilization.
External fertilization in an aquatic environment protects the eggs from drying out. Broadcast spawning can result in a
greater mixture of the genes within a group, leading to higher genetic diversity and a greater chance of species survival in a
hostile environment. For sessile aquatic organisms like sponges, broadcast spawning is the only mechanism for fertilization
and colonization of new environments. The presence of the fertilized eggs and developing young in the water provides
opportunities for predation resulting in a loss of offspring. Therefore, millions of eggs must be produced by individuals,
and the offspring produced through this method must mature rapidly. The survival rate of eggs produced through broadcast
spawning is low.
Internal Fertilization
Internal fertilization occurs most often in land-based animals, although some aquatic animals also use this method. There
are three ways that offspring are produced fol
