asexually reproducing population. The only source of variation in asexual organisms is mutation. This is the ultimate source
of variation in sexual organisms, but in addition, those different mutations are continually reshuffled from one generation
to the next when different parents combine their unique genomes and the genes are mixed into different combinations by
crossovers during prophase I and random assortment at metaphase I.

The Red Queen Hypothesis
It is not in dispute that sexual reproduction provides evolutionary advantages to organisms that employ
this mechanism to produce offspring. But why, even in the face of fairly stable conditions, does sexual
reproduction persist when it is more difficult and costly for individual organisms? Variation is the outcome
of sexual reproduction, but why are ongoing variations necessary? Enter the Red Queen hypothesis, first
proposed by Leigh Van Valen in 1973.[3] The concept was n
