    HBr1g2 + O21g2 ยก  HOOBr1g2
 
    HOOBr1g2 + HBr1g2 ยก 2 HOBr1g2
HOBr1g2 + HBr1g2 ยก  H2O1g2 + Br21g2
 
 (a) Confirm that the elementary reactions add to give the 
overall reaction. (b) Based on the experimentally deter-
mined rate law, which step is rate determining? (c) What 
are the intermediates in this mechanism? (d) If you are 
unable to detect HOBr or HOOBr among the products, 
does this disprove your mechanism?
Catalysis (Section 14.7)
 14.75 (a) What is a catalyst? (b) What is the difference between 
a homogeneous and a heterogeneous catalyst? (c) Do cat-
alysts affect the overall enthalpy change for a reaction, 
the activation energy, or both?
 14.76 (a) Most commercial heterogeneous catalysts are ex-
tremely finely divided solid materials. Why is particle size 
important? (b) What role does adsorption play in the ac-
tion of a heterogeneous catalyst?
 14.77  In Figure 14.21, we saw that Br -1aq2 catalyzes the decom-
position of H2O21aq2 into H2O1l2 and O21g2. Suppose that
