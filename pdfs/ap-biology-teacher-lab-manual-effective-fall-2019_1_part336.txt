energy from carbon compounds produced by other organisms. In multicellular plants, 
photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts within cells. 
The process of photosynthesis occurs in a series of enzyme-mediated steps that 
capture light energy to build energy-rich carbohydrates. The process is summarized by 
the following reaction:
2 H2O + CO2 + light â†’ carbohydrate (CH2O) + O2 + H2O
To determine the net rate of photosynthesis, one could measure one of the following:
Bullet Production of O2  
Bullet Consumption of CO2 
The difficulty related to measuring the production of oxygen is compounded by the 
complementary process of aerobic respiration consuming oxygen as it is produced. 
Therefore, measuring oxygen production is equivalent to measuring net photosynthesis. 
A measurement of respiration in the same system allows one also to estimate the gross 
production.
Generally, the rate of photosynthesis is calculated by measuring the consumption of 
carbon dioxide. However, equipment a
