 in the desert with a very warm body temperature. In contrast to ectotherms,
which rely on external temperatures to set their body temperatures, poikilotherms are animals with constantly varying
internal temperatures. An animal that maintains a constant body temperature in the face of environmental changes is called
a homeotherm. Endotherms are animals that rely on internal sources for body temperature but which can exhibit extremes
in temperature. These animals are able to maintain a level of activity at cooler temperature, which an ectotherm cannot due
to differing enzyme levels of activity.
Heat can be exchanged between an animal and its environment through four mechanisms: radiation, evaporation,
convection, and conduction (Figure 24.22). Radiation is the emission of electromagnetic “heat” waves. Heat comes from
the sun in this manner and radiates from dry skin the same way. Heat can be removed with liquid from a surface during
evaporation. This occurs when a mammal sweats. Convect
