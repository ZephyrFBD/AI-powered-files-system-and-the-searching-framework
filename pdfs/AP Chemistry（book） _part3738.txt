 do come 
closer to the ligands than the e set, and as a result they experience more repulsion and 
are higher in energy. As we see in Figure 23.33, the splitting of d orbitals in a tetrahe-
dral geometry is the opposite of what we find for the octahedral geometry, namely, 
the e orbitals are now below the t2 orbitals. The crystal-field splitting energy ∆ is much 
smaller for tetrahedral complexes than it is for comparable octahedral complexes, in 
part because there are fewer ligand point charges in the tetrahedral geometry, and in 
part because neither set of orbitals has lobes that point directly at the ligands. Calcula-
tions show that for the same metal ion and ligand set, ∆ for the tetrahedral complex is 
only four-ninths as large as for the octahedral complex. For this reason, nearly all tetra-
hedral complexes are high spin; the crystal-field splitting energy is never large enough 
to overcome the spin-pairing energies.
In a square-planar complex, four ligands are arranged abou
