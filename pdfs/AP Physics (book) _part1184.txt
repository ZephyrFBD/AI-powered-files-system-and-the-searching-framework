under the ocean. The bang you hear when a door slams is a sound wave pulse.
A continuous or periodic wave, such as that shown in Fig. 11–22, has as its
source a disturbance that is continuous and oscillating; that is, the source is a
vibration or oscillation. In Fig. 11–22, a hand oscillates one end of the rope.
Water waves may be produced by any vibrating object at the surface, such as your
hand; or the water itself is made to vibrate when wind blows across it or a rock 
is thrown into it. A vibrating tuning fork or drum membrane gives rise to sound
waves in air. We will see later that oscillating electric charges give rise to light
waves. Indeed, almost any vibrating object sends out waves.
The source of any wave, then, is a vibration. And it is a vibration that propa-
gates outward and thus constitutes the wave. If the source vibrates sinusoidally 
in SHM, then the wave itself—if the medium is elastic—will have a sinusoidal
shape both in space and in time. (1) In space:
