KEY TERMS
increase in frequency of beneficial alleles and decrease in deleterious alleles due to selection
(also, gene frequency) rate at which a specific allele appears within a population
when individuals tend to mate with those who are phenotypically similar to themselves
magnification of genetic drift as a result of natural events or catastrophes
gradual geographic variation across an ecological gradient
selection that favors phenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation
selection that favors two or more distinct phenotypes
(also, Darwinian fitness) individual’s ability to survive and reproduce
measure of successful reproduction, the passing on alleles to the next generation
event that initiat
