able and identify 
patterns or trends in the data.
Selecting and creating the appropriate 
type of graph for a set of data are critical 
skills for communicating data that students 
should begin to master in this unit. Students 
should routinely practice analyzing different 
types of data, both hypothetical and those 
they collect, to identify patterns, connect 
variables, and perform statistical analysis. 
Preparing for the AP Exam 
On the exam, students frequently can 
correctly identify an organelle but fail to 
accurately describe its function. Students 
should be able to explain the relationships 
between structure and function on both 
the subcellular and cellular level. Avoid 
using catchy analogies (e.g., cell city) and 
food-based models because on the exam 
students tend to write about the analogy 
without demonstrating an understanding 
of its underlying concept using appropriate 
terminology. 
The graphing skills learned in this unit are 
important. Students should be able
