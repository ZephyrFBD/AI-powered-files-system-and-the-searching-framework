Depending on the location of the receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone, for example, whether
or not it is lipid-soluble, hormones can mediate changes directly by binding to intracellular hormone receptors and
modulating gene expression (transcription and translation), or indirectly by binding to cell surface receptors and simulating
signaling pathways.
The hormone binds to its receptor like a key fits a lock. Because a lipid-derived hormone such as a steroid hormone can
diffuse across the membrane of the target cell, they bind to intracellular receptors residing in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus.
The cell signaling pathways induced by steroid hormones regulate specific genes by acting as transcription regulators. In
turn, this affects the amount of protein produced. Lipid-derived hormones that are not steroids, for example, vitamin D and
thyroxin, bind to receptors located in the nucleus of the target cel
