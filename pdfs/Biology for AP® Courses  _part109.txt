on of various life forms on Earth can be summarized in a phylogenetic tree (Figure 1.17). A phylogenetic tree is
a diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities and differences in genetic
or physical traits or both. A phylogenetic tree is composed of nodes and branches. The internal nodes represent ancestors
and are points in evolution when, based on scientific evidence, an ancestor is thought to have diverged to form two new
species. The length of each branch is proportional to the time elapsed since the split.
Figure 1.17 This phylogenetic tree was constructed by microbiologist Carl Woese using data obtained from
sequencing ribosomal RNA genes. The tree shows the separation of living organisms into three domains: Bacteria,
Archaea, and Eukarya. Bacteria and Archaea are prokaryotes, single-celled organisms lacking intracellular organelles.
