
), and 
is the temperature of the surroundings. This equation
is consistent with the experimental fact that equilibrium between the object and
its surroundings is reached when they come to the same temperature. That is,
must equal zero when 
so 
must be the same for emission and
absorption. This confirms the idea that a good emitter is a good absorber. Because
both the object and its surroundings radiate energy, there is a net transfer of energy
from one to the other unless everything is at the same temperature. From Eq. 14–7
it is clear that if 
the net flow of heat is from the object to the surroundings,
so the object cools. But if 
the net heat flow is from the surroundings into
the object, and the object’s temperature rises. If different parts of the surroundings
are at different temperatures, Eq. 14–7 becomes more complicated.
