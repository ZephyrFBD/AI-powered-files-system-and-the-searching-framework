Calculation of 
near a wire. An electric wire in the wall
of a building carries a dc current of 25 A vertically upward. What is the magnetic
field due to this current at a point P, 10 cm due north of the wire (Fig. 20–23)?
APPROACH We assume the wire is much longer than the 10-cm distance to the
point P so we can apply Eq. 20–6.
SOLUTION According to Eq. 20–6:
or 0.50 G. By right-hand-rule-1 (page 568), the field points to the west (into 
the page in Fig. 20–23) at point P.
NOTE The magnetic field at point P produced by the wire has about the same
magnitude as Earth’s, so a compass at P would not point north but to the northwest.
NOTE Most electrical wiring in buildings consists of cables with two wires in each
cable. Since the two wires carry current in opposite directions, their magnetic
fields ca
