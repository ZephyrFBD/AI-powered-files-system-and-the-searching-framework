 a purple flower color is dominant over a white
flower color. Two pea plants (both of which are heterozygous for round peas and heterozygous for purple
flowers) were crossed and produced 1,600 offspring. The number of offspring with each phenotype is shown in
the following table.
Phenotype
Number of Offspring
Round peas, purple flowers
860
Round peas, white flowers
320
Wrinkled peas, purple flowers
310
Wrinkled peas, white flowers
110
(a) Describe the expected numbers of each phenotype. (Assume the genes for pea shape and flower color are
on different chromosomes.)
(b) Calculate the chi-square value for this experiment.
(c) Evaluate the data for this dihybrid cross using a p-value of 0.05.
(d) The genes for pea shape and flower color are located on different chromosomes. Explain how the data
would have differed if the two genes had been located on the same chromosome.
