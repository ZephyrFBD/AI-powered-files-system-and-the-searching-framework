d is then used to create a standard curve. 
The standard curve, in this case a straight line, is created by graphing the distance each 
fragment traveled through the gel versus the log10 of its base pair length. 
Creating the Standard Curve 
As explained above, base pair (bp) length is substituted for molecular weight. Note 
that in plotting the standard curve, calculating the log10 of the base pair length of each 
fragment is unnecessary because the base pair size is plotted on the logarithmic axis 
of semi-log paper. Examine your stained gel on a light box or other surface that helps 
visualize the bands. 
• What observations can you make? 
• What quantitative measurements can you make? 
1. Examine the “ideal” or mock gel shown in Figure 5 that includes DNA samples 
that have been cut with three restriction enzymes, BamHI, EcoRI, and HindIII, to 
produce RFLPs (fragments). Sample D is DNA that has not been cut with enzyme(s). 
DNA cut with HindIII provides a set of fragments of known
