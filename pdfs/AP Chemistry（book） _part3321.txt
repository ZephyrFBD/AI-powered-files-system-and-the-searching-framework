rrosion. Why is the mag-
nesium referred to as a “sacrificial anode”? (b) Looking in 
Appendix E, suggest what metal the underground pipes 
could be made from in order for magnesium to be success-
ful as a sacrificial anode.
 20.86  An iron object is plated with a coating of cobalt to protect 
against corrosion. Does the cobalt protect iron by cathodic 
protection?
 20.87  Iron corrodes to produce rust, Fe2O3, but other corrosion 
products that can form are Fe(O)(OH), iron oxyhydroxide, 
and magnetite, Fe3O4. (a) What is the oxidation number 
of Fe in iron oxyhydroxide, assuming oxygen’s oxidation 
number is -2? (b) The oxidation number for Fe in mag-
netite was controversial for a long time. If we assume that 
oxygen’s oxidation number is -2, and Fe has a unique 
oxidation number, what is the oxidation number for Fe 
in magnetite? (c) It turns out that there are two different 
kinds of Fe in magnetite that have different oxidation 
numbers. Suggest what these oxidation numbers are and
