Esophagus
After swallowing, food is directed into the esophagus, and not the
windpipe, by the epiglottis, a flap of cartilage in the back of the pharynx
(throat). No digestion occurs in the esophagus.
Stomach
The stomach churns food mechanically and secretes gastric juice that
begins the digestion of proteins. The lining of the stomach contains
