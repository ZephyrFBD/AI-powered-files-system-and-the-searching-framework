to release tonnes of chalk into the atmosphere to ‘deﬂect the Sun and
cool the planet’. Funny how they do this while the heating eﬀect of
the Sun is not factored into climate projections focussed on carbon
dioxide. The reason is that they want to reduce carbon dioxide (so
don’t mention the Sun), but at the same time they do want to reduce
the impact of the Sun which is so essential to human life and health.
I have mentioned the sun-cholesterol-vitamin D connection as they
demonise the Sun with warnings about skin cancer (caused by the
