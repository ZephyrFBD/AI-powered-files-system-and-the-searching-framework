EXERCISE E If you throw a flat 60-kg aluminum plate into water, the plate sinks. But if
that aluminum is shaped into a rowboat, it floats. Explain.
10–8 Fluids in Motion; Flow Rate
and the Equation of Continuity
We now turn to the subject of fluids in motion, which is called fluid dynamics, or
(especially if the fluid is water) hydrodynamics.
We can distinguish two main types of fluid flow. If the flow is smooth, such that
neighboring layers of the fluid slide by each other smoothly, the flow is said to be
streamline or laminar flow.† In streamline flow, each particle of the fluid follows a
smooth path, called a streamline, and these paths do not cross one another (Fig.10–18a).
†The word laminar means “in layers.”
