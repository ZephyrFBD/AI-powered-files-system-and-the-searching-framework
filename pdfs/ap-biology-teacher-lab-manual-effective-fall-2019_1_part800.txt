rmine their functions. The enzyme’s active site 
is very selective, allowing only certain substances to bind. If the shape of an enzyme is 
changed in any way, or the protein denatured, then the binding site also changes, thus 
disrupting enzymatic functions. 
Enzymes are fundamental to the survival of any living system and are organized into 
a number of groups depending on their specific activities. Two common groups are 
catabolic enzymes (“cata” or “kata-” from the Greek “to break down”) — for instance, 
amylase breaks complex starches into simple sugars — and anabolic enzymes (“a-” or 
“an-” from the Greek “to build up”). (You may know this second word already from 
stories about athletes who have been caught using anabolic steroids to build muscle.)
Catalytic enzymes, called proteases, break down proteins and are found in many 
organisms; one example is bromelain, which comes from pineapple and can break down 
gelatin. Bromelain often is an ingredient in commercial meat marinades
