because some of the bacteria will be transformed with the plasmid and will
acquire penicillin resistance. There should be the most growth on plates 1
and 3, where penicillin resistance is not necessary for growth.
No growth on plate 2: penicillin will kill the bacteria
Growth on plate 4: transformed bacteria are penicillin resistant
Most growth on plates 1 and 3: bacteria grow in the absence of penicillin

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Ecosystems are made up of abiotic and biotic factors, which serve as
selective pressures. Abiotic factors include, sunlight, water, nutrients,

competitors, mating, and disease. These factors select individuals with an
increased chance of surviving.
