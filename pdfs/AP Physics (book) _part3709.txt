The principle of equivalence is related to the concept that there are two types
of mass. Newton’s second law,
uses inertial mass. We might say that
inertial mass represents “resistance” to any type of force. The second type of
mass is gravitational mass. When one object attracts another by the gravitational
force (Newton’s law of universal gravitation,
Chapter 5), the
strength of the force is proportional to the product of the gravitational masses of
the two objects. This is much like Coulomb’s law for the electric force between
two objects which is proportional to the product of their electric charges. The
electric charge on an object is not related to its inertial mass; so why should we
expect that an object’s gravitational mass (call it gravitational charge if you like)
be related to its inertial mass? All along we have assumed they were the same.
Why? Because no experiment—not even of high precision—has been able to dis-
cern any measurable difference between inertial
