, reproduction plays a paramount role for genetic change to take root
in a population or species. In short, organisms must be able to reproduce with each other to pass new traits to offspring.
Until recently, these three species of short-tailed pythons, Python curtus, Python brongersmai (middle), and
Python breitensteini were considered one species. However, due to the different locations in which they are
found, they have become three distinct species.
