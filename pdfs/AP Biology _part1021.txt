obvious.
(B) Apoptosis is programmed cell death for cells that are irrevocably
damaged or infected, or for those cells that have simply come to the
end of their life. When such a cell is identified, signals are sent to it
to begin the process of self-destruction. Apoptosis evolved early in
eukaryotic history, so it is found in all kinds of organisms.
(D) In general, substances that are polar and/or charged cannot
diffuse through a membrane; only nonpolar molecules can.
(A) As correctly stated in choice A, the sequence of amino acids
determines the primary structure of a protein. Once the amino acids
are in their ordered place, there are intramolecular interactions (like
hydrogen bonding) that cause the protein to fold into its unique
shape. Secondary structure, tertiary structure, and quaternary
structure are all built on primary structure. So, it is the primary
structure that is least affected by hydrogen bonding.
(B) The drug Oblimersen is an antisense RNA. Therefore, it bin
