ers have found that the circadian clock, which can
be observed by fluorescent markers on proteins that carry
the circadian signal, can be disrupted by changes in light,
nutrition, or exposure to the steroid dexamethasone.
Nutrition can also disrupt the cell cycle clock. Rat
fibroblasts (cells constantly undergoing mitosis) were
cultured on medium containing different levels of fetal
bovine serum (FBS) with and without the addition of
dexamethasone. Confluence is a phenomenon that occurs
in tissue culture when the surface of the growth medium
becomes covered with cells, and the cells stop dividing.
The circadian and cell cycle periods were measured.
