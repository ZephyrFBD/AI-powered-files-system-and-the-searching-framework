derstand how Mendel deduced the basic mechanisms
of inheritance that lead to such ratios, we must first review the laws of probability.
Think About It
Students are performing a cross involving seed color in garden pea plants. Yellow seed color is dominant to green
seed color. What F1 offspring would be expected when cross true-breeding plants with green seeds with true-breading
plants with yellow seeds? Express the answer(s) as percentage.
Probability Basics
Probabilities are mathematical measures of likelihood. The empirical probability of an event is calculated by dividing the
number of times the event occurs by the total number of opportunities for the event to occur. It is also possible to calculate
theoretical probabilities by dividing the number of times that an event is expected to occur by the number of times that
it could occur. Empirical probabilities come from observations, like those of Mendel. Theoretical probabilities come from
knowing how the events are produced and assu
