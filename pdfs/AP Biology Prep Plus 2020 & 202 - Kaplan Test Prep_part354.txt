Physiological reactions can take place without enzymes, but they would
take much longer to proceed. Though enzymes are neither changed nor
consumed during the reaction, reaction conditions such as high
temperatures, detergents, or acidic/basic conditions can cause enzymes
to denature (lose their 3-D structure) and thereby lose their activity. 
As a general rule, the rate of an enzyme will increase with increasing
temperature but only up to a point. If the temperature increases too
much, then the enzyme will become denatured. Moreover, enzymes are

active only within a specific pH range. In the human body, most enzymes
work best around neutral (pH = 7).
EFFECTS OF CONCENTRATION
Reaction rates increase as more and more enzyme is added to a
particular environment. If the enzyme concentration is kept constant, the
reaction rate will plateau at a maximum speed even as substrate
concentration increases, because the enzymes ca
