vities. There are also some
types of cells that are nondividing. Often, these are highly specialized cells that are created from a population of less
specialized cells. The body continually makes them as needed, but they do not directly replicate themselves. Red
blood cells are an example of nondividing cells. Some other cells are just temporarily nondividing. They enter a
phase called G0, where they hang out until they get a signal to reenter the normal cell cycle.
THE CELL CYCLE
Every cell has a life cycle—the period from the beginning of one division to the beginning of the next. The cell’s
life cycle is known as the cell cycle. The cell cycle is divided into two periods: interphase and mitosis. Take a look
at the cell cycle of a typical cell.
Special gametes split their time between interphase and meiosis.
Notice that most of the life of a cell is spent in interphase.
INTERPHASE: THE GROWING PHASE
Interphase is the time span from one cell division to another. We call this stage int
