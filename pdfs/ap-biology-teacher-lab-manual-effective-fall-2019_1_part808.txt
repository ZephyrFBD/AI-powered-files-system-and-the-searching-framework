te” and the other tube 
“enzyme.” To the substrate tube, add 7 mL of distilled water, 0.3 mL of 0.1 percent 
hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2 mL guaiacol for a total volume of 7.5 mL. Cover the test tube 
with a piece of Parafilm® and gently mix. 
Step 2 To the enzyme tube, add 6.0 mL of distilled water and 1.5 mL of peroxidase for a 
total volume of 7.5 mL. Cover the test tube with a piece of Parafilm and gently mix. 
Step 3 Combine the contents of the two tubes (subtrate and enzyme) in another 16 x 150 
mL test tube, cover the tube with Parafilm, invert twice to mix, and place the tube in a 
test tube rack. Immediately begin timing the reaction. 
Step 4 Observe the color change for the next 5 minutes. Rotate the tube before each 
reading. Record the observed color at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes. (A cell phone and/or 
camera are excellent ways to record color change.) 
Step 5 Use the color palette/chart (Figure 1) to help you quantify changes in color over 
time. Graph your data in your la
