sue, is a connective tissue that constitutes the endoskeleton. It contains specialized cells and a matrix
of mineral salts and collagen fibers.
The mineral salts primarily include hydroxyapatite, a mineral formed from calcium phosphate. Calcification is the
process of deposition of mineral salts on the collagen fiber matrix that crystallizes and hardens the tissue. The process of
calcification only occurs in the presence of collagen fibers.
The bones of the human skeleton are classified by their shape: long bones, short bones, flat bones, sutural bones, sesamoid
bones, and irregular bones (Figure 29.16).

Figure 29.16 Shown are different types of bones: flat, irregular, long, short, and sesamoid.
Long bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends. The diaphysis, or central shaft, contains bone
marrow in a marrow cavity. The rounded ends, the ep
