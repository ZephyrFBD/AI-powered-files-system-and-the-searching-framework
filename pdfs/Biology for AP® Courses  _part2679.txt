stimulate cell growth and breaks seed dormancy.
Plants also produce other chemicals to protect against biotic stimuli, including herbivory and parasitism. The fact that plants
produce chemicals should not be surprising; our pharmaceutical industry depends on these substances. For example, species
of the foxglove plant produce digitalis, a powerful heart medicine, whereas the opium from the poppy is the source of many
narcotics.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 and Big Idea 3
of the AP速 Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP速 exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
Big Idea 2
Biological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reprod
