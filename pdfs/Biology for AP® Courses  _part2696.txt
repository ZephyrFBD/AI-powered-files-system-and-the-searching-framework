tical applications of the knowledge of plant responses to
external stimuli and hormones.
Horticulturists find employment in private and governmental laboratories, greenhouses, botanical gardens,
and in the production or research fields. They improve crops by applying their knowledge of genetics and
plant physiology. To prepare for a horticulture career, students take classes in botany, plant physiology, plant
pathology, landscape design, and plant breeding. To complement these traditional courses, horticulture
majors add studies in economics, business, computer science, and communications.
The Blue Light Responses
Phototropism—the directional bending of a plant toward or away from a light source—is a response to blue wavelengths
of light. Positive phototropism is growth towards a light source (Figure 23.39), while negative phototropism (also called
skototropism) is growth away from light.
The aptly-named phototropins are protein-based receptors responsible for mediating the phototropic
