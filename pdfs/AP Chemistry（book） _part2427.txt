l21g2, the equi-
librium constant Kp is 0.497 at 500 K. A gas cylinder at 500 K is 
charged with PCl51g2 at an initial pressure of 1.66 atm. What 
are the equilibrium pressures of PCl5, PCl3, and Cl2 at this 
temperature?
15.7 ∣ Le Châtelier’s Principle
Many of the products we use in everyday life are obtained from the chemical industry. 
Chemists and chemical engineers in industry spend a great deal of time and effort to 
maximize the yield of valuable products and minimize waste. For example, when Haber 
developed his process for making ammonia from N2 and H2, he examined how reaction 
conditions might be varied to increase yield. Using the values of the equilibrium con-
stant at various temperatures, he calculated the equilibrium amounts of NH3 formed 
under a variety of conditions. Some of Haber’s results are shown in Figure 15.10.
Notice that the percent of NH3 present at equilibrium decreases with increasing 
temperature and increases with increasing pressure.
We can understand t
