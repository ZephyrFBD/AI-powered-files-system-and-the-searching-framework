Extinction
There have been many extinctions throughout Earth’s history. The rate of extinction can vary and is usually
accelerated during ecological stress. Humans have been a large ecological stressor and have likely contributed to
extinction events. A population with high genetic diversity is more protected from extinction events because there is
a higher chance that an individual will have the characteristics required to survive the ecological stress leading to the
extinction event. When a species becomes extinct, the niche it occupied can become available to other species.
ORIGINS OF THE EARTH
The Earth formed approximately 4.6 billions years ago. Prior to 3.9 billion years ago, the Earth was likely an
extremely hostile place. The earliest evidence of life is approximately 3.5 billions years ago, but how did life arise?
This is still a hotly debated topic among scientists. Most scientists be
