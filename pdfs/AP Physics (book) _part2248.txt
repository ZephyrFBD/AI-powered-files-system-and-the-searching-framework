 have a net magnetic dipole moment which can align
slightly with an external field, just as the galvanometer coil in Fig. 20–35 experiences a torque that
tends to align it; (2) diamagnetic materials have atoms with no net dipole moment, but in the pres-
ence of an external field electrons revolving in one direction increase in speed slightly whereas
electrons revolving in the opposite direction are reduced in speed; the result is a slight net magnetic
effect that opposes the external field.

The total magnetic field 
is then the sum of two terms,
is the field due to the current in the solenoid coil and 
is the additional field due
to the iron. Often
The total field can also be written by replacing the
constant 
in Eq. 20–8 (
