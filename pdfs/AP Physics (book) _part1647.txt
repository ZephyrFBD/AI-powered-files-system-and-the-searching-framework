15–7 Entropy and the Second Law
of Thermodynamics
Thus far we have stated the second law of thermodynamics for specific situations.
What we really need is a general statement of the second law of thermodynamics
that will cover all situations, including processes discussed earlier in this Chapter
that are not observed in nature even though they would not violate the first law of
thermodynamics. It was not until the latter half of the nineteenth century that the
second law of thermodynamics was finally stated in a general way—namely, in
terms of a quantity called entropy, introduced by Clausius in the 1860s. Entropy,
unlike heat, is a function of the state of a system. That is, a system in a given state
has a temperature, a volume, a pressure, a mass, and also has a particular value
of entropy. In the next Section, we will see that entropy can be interpreted as a
measure of th
