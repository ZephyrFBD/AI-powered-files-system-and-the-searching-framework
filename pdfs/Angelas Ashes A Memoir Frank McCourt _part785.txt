out of an English magazine when I 
 
 could be at home with a cup of tea and a nice bun and a read of The 
 
 Irish Press with my feet up on a box under the picture of the Sacred 
 
 Heart nice bloody how do you do entirely. 
 
 Mr. McCaffrey runs into every shop with us behind him. He grabs 
 
 the magazines, hands each of us a pile and tells us start tearing. Shop 
 
 owners scream at him, What are ye doing? Jesus, Mary and Holy St. 
 
 Joseph, is it pure mad ye are? Put back them magazines or I’ll call the 
 
 guards. 
 
 Mr. McCaffrey tells them,Government orders, ma’am.There is filth 
 
  
  
 in John O’London this week that’s not fit for any Irish eyes and we are 
 
 here to do God’s work. 
 
 What filth? What filth? Show me the filth before ye go mutilatin’ 
 
 the magazines. I won’t pay Easons for these magazines, so I won’t. 
 
 Ma’am,we don’t care at Easons.We’d rather lose large amounts than 
 
 have the people of Limerick and Ireland corrupted by this filth. 
 
 What filth?
