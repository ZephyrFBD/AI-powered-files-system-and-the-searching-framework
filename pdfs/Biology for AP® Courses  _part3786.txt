s can also change temporarily. Because blood plasma is one of the fluid components, osmotic pressures have a
direct bearing on blood pressure.
Transport of Electrolytes across Cell Membranes
Electrolytes, such as sodium chloride, ionize in water, meaning that they dissociate into their component ions. In water,
sodium chloride (NaCl), dissociates into the sodium ion (Na+) and the chloride ion (Cl–). The most important ions,
whose concentrations are very closely regulated in body fluids, are the cations sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium
(Ca+2), magnesium (Mg+2), and the anions chloride (Cl–), carbonate (CO3–2), bicarbonate (HCO3–), and phosphate(PO3–).
Electrolytes are lost from the body during urination and perspiration. For this reason, athletes are encouraged to replace
electrolytes and fluids during periods of increased activity and perspiration.
Osmotic pressure is influenced by the concentration of solutes in a solution. It is directly proportional to the number of
solute atom
