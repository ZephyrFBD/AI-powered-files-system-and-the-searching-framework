14. Which of the following best describes the reason 
for excluding hybrid males when calculating  
the allele frequencies of two interbreeding 
populations at the intermediate stage of speciation 
(Figure 2) ? 
(A) The process of mate selection in large groups 
often favors females over males. 
(B) The frequency of sex-determining 
chromosomes is usually equal to 0.5. 
(C) Sterile individuals make no genetic 
contribution to the next generation. 
(D) The chance of inheriting a recessive allele 
from a male is too small to calculate. 
15. In a separate investigation, individual mice from 
two populations that in nature are geographically 
isolated from each other are mated in the 
laboratory. The hybrid offspring were then mated 
with individuals from either of the original 
populations. Only the female hybrid offspring 
were fertile. The experimental results are most 
consistent with which of the stages that are 
depicted in the model? 
(A) Initial p
