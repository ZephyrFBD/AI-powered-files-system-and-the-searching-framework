NA sedimented
halfway between the 15 N and 14 N levels after
one round of cell division, indicating fifty
percent presence of 14 N . This supports the
semi-conservative replication model.
b.
Meselson and Stahl experimented with S.
pneumonia. DNA grown in 15 N was heavier
than DNA grown in 14 N . When DNA in 15 N
was switched to 14 N media, DNA sedimented
halfway between the 15 N and 14 N levels after
one round of cell division, indicating fifty
percent presence of 14 N . This supports the
semi-conservative replication model.
c.
Meselson and Stahl experimented with E. coli.
DNA grown in 14 N was heavier than DNA
grown in 15 N . When DNA in 15 N was
switched to 14 N media, DNA sedimented
halfway between the 15 N and 14 N levels after
one round of cell division, indicating fifty
percent presence of 14 N . This supports the
semi-conservative replication model.
d.
Meselson and Stahl experimented with S.
pneumonia. DNA grown in 15 N was heavier
than DNA grown in 14 N . When DNA in 15 N
