angle
to the horizontal, with
(a) Determine the acceleration
of the crate as it slides down the plane.
(b) If the crate starts from rest 8.15 m up
along the plane from its base, what will
be the crate’s speed when it reaches
the bottom of the incline?

64. (II) On an icy day, you worry about parking your car in
your driveway, which has an incline of 12°. Your neighbor’s
driveway has an incline of 9.0°, and the driveway across
the street is at 6.0°. The coefficient of static friction
between tire rubber and ice is 0.15. Which driveway(s) 
will be safe to park in?
