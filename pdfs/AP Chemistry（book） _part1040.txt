 [6.89]  Consider a transition in which the electron of a hydrogen 
atom is excited from n = 1 to n = ∞. (a) What is the end 
result of this transition? (b) What is the wavelength of light 
that must be absorbed to accomplish this process? (c) What 
will occur if light with a shorter wavelength than that in part 
(b) is used to excite the hydrogen atom? (d) How are the results 
of parts (b) and (c) related to the plot shown in Exercise 6.88?
 6.90  The human retina has three types of receptor cones, each 
sensitive to a different range of wavelengths of visible light, 
as shown in this ﬁgure (the colors are merely to differentiate 
the three curves from one another; they do not indicate the 
actual colors represented by each curve):

we measure the position of a subatomic particle without 
disturbing it? (b) How is this concept relat
