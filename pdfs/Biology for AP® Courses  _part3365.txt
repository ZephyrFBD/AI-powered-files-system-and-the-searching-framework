Hormonal Stimuli
Hormonal stimuli refers to the release of a hormone in response to another hormone. A number of endocrine glands release
hormones when stimulated by hormones released by other endocrine glands. For example, the hypothalamus produces
hormones that stimulate the anterior portion of the pituitary gland. The anterior pituitary in turn releases hormones that
regulate hormone production by other endocrine glands. The anterior pituitary releases the thyroid-stimulating hormone,
which then stimulates the thyroid gland to produce the hormones T3 and T4. As blood concentrations of T3 and T4 rise, they
inhibit both the pituitary and the hypothalamus in a negative feedback loop.
Neural Stimuli
In some cases, the nervous system directly stimulates endocrine glands to release hormones, which is referred to as
neural stimuli. Recall that in a short-term stress response, the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are important for
providing the bursts of
