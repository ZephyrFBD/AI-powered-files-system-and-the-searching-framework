is oxidized (at the electron transport chain) to NAD+, which can then be
returned to be used in glycolysis. However, if oxygen is not present, oxidative phosphorylation cannot occur. (Recall
that oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the ETC. Without oxygen present, the ETC cannot release its low-energy
electrons from the final carrier, blocking the chain and shutting the entire system down.) In anaerobic conditions,
cells carry out fermentation to regenerate the NAD+ needed to keep the process of glycolysis going. If a cell ran out
of NAD+, it could no longer perform glycolysis. All generation of ATP would stop, resulting in the death of the cell.
Fermentation occurs only in the cytosol. The two major types of fermentation you need to know are shown in
Figures 9.6 and 9.7: alcohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation.
In alcohol fermentation, pyruvate is reduced to an alcohol (typically the two-carbon alcohol ethanol) and carbon
dioxide, and NADH is oxidized to NAD+. An exampl
