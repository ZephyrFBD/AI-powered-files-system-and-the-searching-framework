Carbon Dating
Carbon is normally present in the atmosphere in the form of gaseous compounds like carbon dioxide and
methane. Carbon-14 (14C) is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere from
atmospheric 14N (nitrogen) by the addition of a neutron and the loss of a proton because of cosmic rays.
This is a continuous process, so more 14C is always being created. As a living organism incorporates 14C
initially as carbon dioxide fixed in the process of photosynthesis, the relative amount of 14C in its body is
equal to the concentration of 14C in the atmosphere. When an organism dies, it is no longer ingesting 14C,
so the ratio between 14C and 12C will decline as 14C decays gradually to 14N by a process called beta
decay—the emission of electrons or positrons. This decay gives off energy in a slow
