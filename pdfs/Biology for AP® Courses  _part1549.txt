s, DNA polymerase is able to remove the wrongly incorporated bases from the newly synthesized, non-
methylated strand. In eukaryotes, the mechanism is not very well understood, but it is believed to involve recognition of
unsealed nicks in the new strand, as well as a short-term continuing association of some of the replication proteins with the
new daughter strand after replication has completed.
Figure 14.18 In mismatch repair, the incorrectly added base is detected after replication. The mismatch repair proteins
detect this base and remove it from the newly synthesized strand by nuclease action. The gap is now filled with the
correctly paired base.
In another type of repair mechanism, nucleotide excision repair, enzymes replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both
the 3' and 5' ends of the incorrect base (Figure 14.19). The segment of DNA is removed and replaced with the correctly
paired nucleotides by the action of DNA pol. Once the bases are filled in, the remaining gap is seal
