n with fluorine gas. (e) ∆Hf°  for BF31g2 is -1135.6 kJ>mol.  
Calculate the standard enthalpy change in the 
reaction of boron with fluorine. (f) Will the mass percentage of F be the same in 10BF3 and 11BF3? If not, why is that the case?

electron-density distribution is a map of the probability of finding the 
electron at all points in space.
The allowed wave functions of the hydrogen atom are called 
orbitals. An orbital is described by a combination of an integer and a 
letter, corresponding to values of three quantum numbers. The prin-
cipal quantum number, n, is indicated by the integers 1, 2, 3, . . . . This 
quantum number relates most directly to the size and energy of the 
orbital. The angular momentum quantum number, l, is indicated by the 
letters s, p, d, f, and so on, corresponding to the values of 0, 1, 2, 3, . . 
. . The l quantum number defines the shape of the orbital. For a given 
value of n, l can have integer values ranging from 0 to 1n - 12
