s change from generation to generation in a group of interbreeding
organisms. When evolution occurs as a result of natural selection, alleles of those individuals with traits enabling
them to survive and reproduce better than others get passed on to the next generation. Over time, the best alleles
accumulate in the population. Natural selection acts upon the available traits in the population. Mutations add new
alleles, increase variation, and may introduce traits that are more successful that others in the population. Variation
can be introduced into the population by mixing up existing alleles through genetic recombination, but mutation is
the raw material for variation. It is the only mechanism that can introduce new alleles that didnâ€™t previously exist.
b. Genetic drift is another mechanism that can cause evolution, that is, cause allele frequencies to change. Genetic
drift describes random changes in allele frequencies. This is especially influential in evolution when populations
