 Ebola, one of the
fastest and most deadly viruses on earth. Transmitted by bats and great apes, this disease can cause death in 70â€“90 percent
of infected humans within 2 weeks. Using newly developed vaccines that boost the immune response in this way, there is
hope that affected individuals will be better able to control the virus, potentially saving a greater percentage of infected
persons from a rapid and very painful death.
Another way of treating viral infections is the use of antiviral drugs. These drugs often have limited success in curing viral
disease, but in many cases, they have been used to control and reduce symptoms for a wide variety of viral diseases. For
most viruses, these drugs can inhibit the virus by blocking the actions of one or more of its proteins. It is important that the
targeted proteins be encoded by viral genes and that these molecules are not present in a healthy host cell. In this way, viral
growth is inhibited without damaging the host. There are large
