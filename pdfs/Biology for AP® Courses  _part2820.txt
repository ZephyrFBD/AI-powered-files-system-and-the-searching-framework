e) is perpendicular to the sagittal planes and the long axis of the body. This is sometimes called a cross section, and, if
the transverse cut is at an angle, it is called an oblique plane. Figure 24.5 illustrates these planes on a goat (a four-legged
animal) and a human being.
Figure 24.5 Shown are the planes of a quadruped goat and a bipedal human. The midsagittal plane divides the body
exactly in half, into right and left portions. The frontal plane divides the front and back, and the transverse plane divides
the body into upper and lower portions.
Vertebrate animals have a number of defined body cavities, as illustrated in Figure 24.6. Two of these are major cavities
that contain smaller cavities within them. The dorsal cavity contains the cranial and the vertebral (or spinal) cavities. The
ventral cavity contains the thoracic cavity, which in turn contains the pleural cavity around the lungs and the pericardial
cavity, which surrounds the heart. The ventral cavity also contains th
