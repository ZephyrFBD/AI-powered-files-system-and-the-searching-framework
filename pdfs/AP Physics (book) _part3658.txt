45. Protons are injected into the 4.3-km-radius Large Hadron
Collider with an energy of 450 GeV. If they are accelerated
by 8.0 MV each revolution, how far do they travel and
approximately how much time does it take for them to
reach 4.0 TeV?

CHAPTER 32
Elementary Particles
1. (a) What are the two major classes of particles that make
up the matter of the universe? (b) Name six types, or
flavors, of each class of particles. (c) What are the four
known fundamental forces in the universe? (d) Name the
particles that carry the forces in part c. Which force is
much weaker than the other three?
2. (a) What property characterizes all hadrons? (b) What
property characterizes all baryons? (c) What property
characterizes all mesons?
3. Show that all conservation laws hold for all the decays
described in Fig. 32–15 for the decays of the top quark.
4. The Higgs boson, Section 32–10, has very probably been
detected at the CERN LHC. (a) If a Hi
