 and optical isomerism. Geometric isomers differ from one 
another in the relative locations of donor atoms in the coordination 
sphere; the most common being cis and trans isomers. Geomet-
ric isomers differ from one another in their chemical and physical 
properties. Optical isomers are nonsuperimposable mirror images 
of each other. Optical isomers, or enantiomers, are chiral, meaning 
that they have a specific “handedness” and differ only in the pres-
ence of a chiral environment. Optical isomers can be distinguished 
from one another by their interactions with plane-polarized light; 
solutions of one isomer rotate the plane of polarization to the right 
(dextrorotatory), and solutions of its mirror image rotate the plane to 
the left (levorotatory). Chiral molecules, therefore, are optically active. 
A 50950 mixture of two optical isomers does not rotate plane-polar-
ized light and is said to be racemic.
