mplex ion is a mixture of the 
complementary colors—blue and violet. Finally, for 3Ni(en)342+ the peak shifts to an 
even shorter wavelength, 540 nm, which lies near the boundary between green and 
yellow. The resulting color purple is a mixture of the complementary colors red and 
violet.

If you were to use a ligand L that was a stronger field ligand 
than ethylenediamine, what color would you expect the 
3NiL642+ complex ion to have?

▲ Figure 23.30 Effect of ligand on crystal-field splitting. The greater the crystal-field strength of 
the ligand, the greater the energy gap ∆ it causes between the t2 and e sets of the metal ion’s 
orbitals. This shifts the wavelength of the absorption maximum to shorter values.
*The other two peaks fall in the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) regions of t
