Which of the following statements about the enteric endocrine system is true?
a.
Gastrin stimulates pancreatic enzyme and bile secretion.
b.
The enteric endocrine system includes all endocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract.
c.
All hormone-secreting cells in the enteric endocrine system are clustered together.
d.
Enteric endocrine system cells secrete enzymes in response to specific stimuli.
Another level of hormonal control occurs in response to the composition of food. Foods high in lipids take a long time
to digest. A hormone called gastric inhibitory peptide is secreted by the small intestine to slow down the peristaltic
movements of the intestine to allow fatty foods more time to be digested and absorbed.
Understanding the hormonal control of the digestive system is an important area of ongoing research. Scientists are
exploring the role of each hormone in the digestive process an
