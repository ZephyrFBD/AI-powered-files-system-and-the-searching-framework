type 
in labels in your other cells and, if you wish, shade the cells as well. This blue area will 
represent the gene pool for your model. (Highlight the area you wish to format with 
color, and right-click with your mouse in Excel to format.) This is a spreadsheet, so you 
can enter the value for the frequency of the B allele; however, when making a model it is 
best to have the spreadsheet do as many of the calculations as possible. All of the alleles 
in the gene pool are either A or B; therefore p + q = 1 and 1 - p = q. In cell D3, enter the 
formula to calculate the value of q. 
In spreadsheet lingo it is 
=1-D2

Your spreadsheet now should look something like Figure 2.

Letâ€™s explore how one important spreadsheet function works before we incorporate it 
into our model. In a nearby empty cell, enter the function (we will remove it later). 
=Rand() 
Note that the parentheses have nothing between them. After hitting return, what do 
you find in
