/water interface of the alveoli has a high surface tension. This surface tension is similar to the surface tension
of water at the liquid-air interface of a water droplet that results in the bonding of the water molecules together. Surfactant
is a complex mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins that works to reduce the surface tension that exists between the
alveoli tissue and the air found within the alveoli. By lowering the surface tension of the alveolar fluid, it reduces the
tendency of alveoli to collapse.
Surfactant works like a detergent to reduce the surface tension and allows for easier inflation of the airways. When a balloon
is first inflated, it takes a large amount of effort to stretch the plastic and start to inflate the balloon. If a little bit of detergent
was applied to the interior of the balloon, then the amount of effort or work needed to begin to inflate the balloon would
decrease, and it would become much easier to start blowing up the balloon. This same princip
