Cooperativity
Cooperativity is a type of allosteric activation. The binding of one
substrate molecule to one active site of one subunit of the enzyme causes a
change in the entire molecule and locks all subunits in an active position.
This mechanism amplifies the response of an enzyme to its substrates. See
Figure 5.10.

CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter supported Big Ideas: ENE and SYI.
Living organisms require a constant input of energy. They
constantly transform energy from one form to another subject to the
laws of thermodynamics.
Free energy (ΔG) changes tell us if a reaction is endergonic or
exergonic and spontaneous.
Enzymes speed up metabolic reactions by making it easier for
reactions to occur.
The shape of an enzyme is critical to how it functions. The shape
can be altered (denatured) by extremes in temperature and pH.
Enzyme function is regulated by inhibitors and feedback
