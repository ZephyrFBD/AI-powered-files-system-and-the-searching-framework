ong before they run
out of fuel. If they germinated even a centimeter under the soil surface, the seedling would never make it into the sunlight
and would die. In the dark, phytochrome is in the Pr (inactive form) and the seed will not germinate; it will only germinate
if exposed to light at the surface of the soil. Upon exposure to light, Pr is converted to Pfr and germination proceeds.

Figure 23.38 The biologically inactive form of phytochrome (Pr) is converted to the biologically active form Pfr under
illumination with red light. Far-red light and darkness convert the molecule back to the inactive form.
Plants also use the phytochrome system to sense the change of season. Photoperiodism is a biological response to the timing
and duration of day and night. It controls flowering, setting of winter buds, and vegetative growth. Detection of seasonal
changes is cruci
