 (a) After the label fell off a bottle containing a clear liquid be-
lieved to be benzene, a chemist measured the density of the 
liquid to verify its identity. A 25.0-mL portion of the liquid 
had a mass of 21.95 g. A chemistry handbook lists the density 
of benzene at 15 °C as 0.8787 g>mL. Is the calculated density 
in agreement with the tabulated value? (b) An experiment 
requires 15.0 g of cyclohexane, whose density at 25 °C is 
0.7781 g>mL. What volume of cyclohexane should be used? 
(c) A spherical ball of lead has a diameter of 5.0 cm. What is 
the mass of the sphere if lead has a density of 11.34 g>cm3? 
(The volume of a sphere is 14>32pr3, where r is the radius.)
 1.39  In the year 2013, an estimated amount of 36 billion metric 
tons (1 metric ton = 1000 kg) of carbon dioxide 1CO22 was 
emitted worldwide due to fossil fuel combustion and cement 
production. Express this mass of CO2 in grams without ex-
ponential notation, using an appropriate metric prefix.
