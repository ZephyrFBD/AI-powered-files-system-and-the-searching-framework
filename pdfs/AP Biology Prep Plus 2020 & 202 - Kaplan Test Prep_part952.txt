aries widely between cell types; gene regulation happens mostly at
the level of mRNA synthesis, not protein synthesis. (C) is incorrect
because, under normal conditions, very little genetic information, if
any, is lost during development. Nearly all cell types will retain the full
genome of the organism by the time that they have developed into
their mature forms. (D) is incorrect because, even though some
proteins can perform diﬀerent functions in diﬀerent contexts, they
generally perform the same function across diﬀerent cell types.
34. B
Erythropoiesis would not be stimulated if kidney cells were unable to
detect low oxygen levels in the blood. Thus, oxygen levels in the blood
would continue to decrease. In turn, cells would not receive enough
oxygen, resulting in tissue hypoxia (a condition in which available
oxygen reaching the tissue is inadequate). (B) is correct. (A) is incorrect
because erythropoietin and the number of erythrocytes would
decrease as a result of kidney cells be
