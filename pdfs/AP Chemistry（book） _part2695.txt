ut quantities (which means 
you will need to use the quadratic equation). The Ka of CH3COOH is 1.80 * 10-5.
Analyze We are asked to calculate the pH of a buffer two different 
ways. We know the initial concentrations of the weak acid and its 
conjugate base, and the Ka of the weak acid.
Plan We will first use the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, which 
relates pKa and ratio of acid–base concentrations to the pH. This 
will be straightforward. Then, we will redo the calculation making 
SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 17.4 
Calculating pH When the Henderson–Hasselbalch Equation May Not Be Accurate
no assumptions about any quantities, which means we will need 
to write out the initial/change/equilibrium concentrations, as we 
have done before. In addition, we will need to solve for quantities 
using the quadratic equation (since we cannot make assumptions 
about unknowns being small).
Solve
(i) The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation is:
pH = pKa + log
3base4
3acid4
We know the Ka of the acid 11.8 * 1
