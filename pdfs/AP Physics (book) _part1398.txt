n they are in
thermal equilibrium with each other.
This postulate is called the zeroth law of thermodynamics. It has this unusual
name because it was not until after the first and second laws of thermodynamics
(Chapter 15) were worked out that scientists realized that this apparently obvious
postulate needed to be stated first.
Temperature is a property of a system that determines whether the system
will be in thermal equilibrium with other systems. When two systems are in ther-
mal equilibrium, their temperatures are (by definition) equal, and no net thermal
energy is exchanged between them. This is consistent with our everyday notion
of temperature: when a hot object and a cold one are put into contact, they even-
tually come to the same temperature. Thus the importance of the zeroth law is
that it allows a useful definition of temperature.

13â€“4 Thermal Expansion
Most substances expand when heated and contract when cooled. However, the
amount of expansion or contraction varies, dep
