of their chromosomes.
Replication of Telomeres
During replication of the lagging strand, each Okazaki fragment begins when primase, moving toward the
replication fork, assembles an RNA primer. The RNA primer is subsequently removed and replaced with DNA
nucleotides by a DNA polymerase moving away from the replication fork (complimentary strand 5′ → 3′). A special
situation occurs, however, at the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes.
Two problems can occur when replication reaches the end of the DNA strand. One occurs when not enough template
strand remains to which primase can attach. Another problem occurs when the last primase is removed. If there is no
next Okazaki fragment to which DNA polymerase can attach, the empty space left by the removal of the primer is
left unfilled.
To solve these problems and to prevent the loss of DNA in the replicate strand, the enzyme telomerase attaches to
the end of the template strand and extends the template strand by adding a short sequence of DNA
