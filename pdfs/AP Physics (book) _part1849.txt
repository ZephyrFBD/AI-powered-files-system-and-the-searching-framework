wn (dashed green lines) for the
electric field (red lines) between two parallel plates at a potential difference of
20 V. The negative plate is arbitrarily chosen to be zero volts and the potential of
each equipotential line is indicated. Note that 
points toward lower values of V.
The equipotential lines for the case of two equal but oppositely charged particles
are shown in Fig. 17–7 as green dashed lines. (This combination of equal 
and 
charges is called an “electric dipole,” as we saw in Section 16–8; see Fig. 16–32a.)
Unlike electric field lines, which start and end on electric charges, equipotential
lines and surfaces are always continuous and never end, and so continue beyond
the borders of Figs. 17–6 and 17–7. A useful analogy for equipotential lines is a
topographic map: the contour lines are gravitational equipotential lines (Fig.17–8).
We saw in Section 16–9 that there can be no electric field within a conductor in the
static case, for otherwise the free electrons would fee
