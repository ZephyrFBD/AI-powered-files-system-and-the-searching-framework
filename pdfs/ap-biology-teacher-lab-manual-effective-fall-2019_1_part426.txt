, and how those differences are related 
to the mitotic behavior of the cancer cells. After modeling meiosis and crossing-over 
events to increase genetic variation, students mimic the phenomenon of nondisjunction 
and its relationship to genetic disorders. In a final experiment, students measure cross-
over frequencies and genetic outcomes in a fungus. 
 Investigation 8: Biotechnology: Bacterial Transformation  is 
a revision of Laboratory 6A (Molecular Biology: Bacterial Transformation) in the 
2001 AP Biology Lab Manual. The investigation begins with a question guaranteed to 
provoke student interest: Are genetically modified foods safe? One current argument is 
whether corn grown to express the Bt toxin (a pesticide) is safe for human consumption. 
Although genetic information can be changed through mutations in DNA or RNA 
and errors in information transfer, biotechnology makes it possible to engineer 
heritable changes to yield novel protein products, such as the Bt toxin. One te
