al to pack together closely. Because we can consider the 
shape of an atom to be a sphere, we can understand the structures of metals by consider-
ing how spheres pack. The most efficient way to pack one layer of equal-sized spheres is 
to surround each sphere by six neighbors, as shown at the top of Figure 12.13. To form a 
three-dimensional structure, we need to stack additional layers on top of this base layer. 
To maximize packing efficiency, the second layer of spheres must sit in the depressions 
formed by the spheres in the first layer. We can either put the next layer of atoms into 
the depressions marked by the yellow dot or the depressions marked by the red dot (real-
izing that the spheres are too large to simultaneously fill both sets of depressions). For 
the sake of discussion we arbitrarily put the second layer in the yellow depressions.
For the third layer, we have two choices for where to place the spheres. One possibil-
ity is to put the third layer in the depressions
