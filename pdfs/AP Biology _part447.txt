 calculate frequencies of
alleles in a population. Although it can be applied to complex situations of
inheritance, for the purpose of explanation here, we will discuss a simple
caseâ€”a gene locus with only two alleles. Scientists use the letter p to stand
for the frequency of the dominant allele and the letter q to stand for the
frequency of the recessive allele.
The Hardy-Weinberg equation is
p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 or p + q = 1
The monohybrid cross is the basis for this equation.
As of 2020, you are allowed to use your calculator on the exam. Even if
the Hardy-Weinberg problems are not so simple, the principle is the same.
Here are three sample problems.
PROBLEM 1
If 9% of the population has blue eyes, what percent of the population is hybrid for
brown eyes? What percent of the population is homozygous for brown eyes?
To solve this problem, follow these steps:
The trait for blue eyes is homozygous recessive, bb, and is represented
by q2.
