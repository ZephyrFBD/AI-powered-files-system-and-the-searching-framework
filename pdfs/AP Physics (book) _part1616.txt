a temperature change; rather, a change in phase occurs. We can determine the
heat Q required using the latent heat of water, as in Section 14–5. Work too will
be done:
The first law of thermodynamics will then give us 
SOLUTION The latent heat of vaporization of water (Table 14–3) is
So the heat input required for this process is (Eq. 14–4)
The work done by the water is (Eq. 15–3 since P is constant)
where we used
and
Then
NOTE Most of the heat added goes to increasing the internal energy of the water
(increasing molecular energy to overcome the attraction that held the molecules
close together in the liquid state). Only a small part 
goes into doing work.
NOTE Equation 14–1,
tells us that 
for Example 15–6
because 
Yet we determined that 
What is wrong?
Equation 14–1 applies only to an ideal monatomic gas, not to liquid water.
