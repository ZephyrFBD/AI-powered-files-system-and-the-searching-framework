ure to an allergen, an IgE antibody is synthesized by plasma cells in response to a
harmless antigen. The IgE molecules bind to mast cells, and on secondary exposure, the mast cells release histamines
and other modulators that affect the symptoms of allergy. (credit: modification of work by NIH)
Delayed hypersensitivity is a cell-mediated immune response that takes approximately one to two days after secondary
exposure for a maximal reaction to be observed. This type of hypersensitivity involves the TH1 cytokine-mediated
inflammatory response and may manifest as local tissue lesions or contact dermatitis (rash or skin irritation). Delayed
hypersensitivity occurs in some individuals in response to contact with certain types of jewelry or cosmetics. Delayed
hypersensitivity facilitates the immune response to poison ivy and is also the reason why the skin test for tuberculosis results
in a small region of inflammation on individuals who were previously exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosi
