lens.
Image formed by converging lens. What is (a) the posi-
tion, and (b) the size, of the image of a 7.6-cm-high leaf placed 1.00 m from a
-mm-focal-length camera lens?
APPROACH We follow the steps of the Problem Solving Strategy explicitly.
SOLUTION
1. Ray diagram. Figure 23–42 is an approximate ray diagram, showing only rays 1
and 3 for a single point on the leaf. We see that the image ought to be a little
behind the focal point F, to the right of the lens.
2. Thin lens and magnification equations. (a) We find the image position analyt-
ically using the thin lens equation, Eq. 23–8. The camera lens is converging,
with
and
and so the thin lens equation gives
Then, taking the reciprocal,
or 52.6 mm behind the lens.
(b) The magnification is
so
The image is 4.0 mm high.
3. Sign conventions. The image distance 
came out positive, so the image is
behind the lens. The image height is
the minus sign means
the image is inverted.
4. Consistency. The analytic results of steps 2 and 3 are cons
