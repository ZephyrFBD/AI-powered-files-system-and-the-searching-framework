The cell starting meiosis is called a primary oocyte, as shown in Figure 34.15. This cell will start the first meiotic division
and be arrested in its progress in the first prophase stage. At the time of birth, all future eggs are in the prophase stage.
At adolescence, anterior pituitary hormones cause the development of a number of follicles in an ovary. This results in
the primary oocyte finishing the first meiotic division. The cell divides unequally, with most of the cellular material and
organelles going to one cell, called a secondary oocyte, and only one set of chromosomes and a small amount of cytoplasm
going to the other cell. This second cell is called a polar body and usually dies. A secondary meiotic arrest occurs, this
time at the metaphase II stage. At ovulation, this secondary oocyte will be released and travel toward the uterus through the
oviduct.
