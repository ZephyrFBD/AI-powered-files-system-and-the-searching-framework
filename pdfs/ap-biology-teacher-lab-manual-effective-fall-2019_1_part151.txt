res these kinds of operations and decisions. What 
is different about this manual is that the decisions are up to you. The manual doesn’t 
make the decisions for you. There are almost always a number of reasonable, productive 
solutions to such problems. Make sure that your decisions are reasonable and provide a 
good solution to the problem you are studying. 
Precision needed in the experiment is also a consideration and a decision you have to 
make. Increasing precision requires more time and resources. How precise do your data 
need to be for you to support or reject your hypothesis? 
■ Graphing, Mapping, and Ordering: Histograms of 
Variation and/or Energy Flow Diagrams 
To build on the previous two examples, consider how the data counted and measured 
should be represented — not numerically, but with graphs or diagrams. For example, 
consider the examination of the variation of a quantitative trait in a population of plants. 
How do you best represent these data? If you count the
