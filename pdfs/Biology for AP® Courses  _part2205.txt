a.
The grass population is adapting to the mowing,
so it can flower for longer before being mowed.
b.
Mowing stabilizes the flowering time, which
follows a steady trend in the mowed field but not
in the unmowed field.
c.
The mowing is preventing the grass from
reproducing, causing the mowed field to adapt
by flowering earlier.
d.
The grass typically flowers earlier and earlier
every year as it becomes older with each passing
year.
32. A scientist observed two populations of insects for 10
years. They took data on the length, in mm , of the insectâ€™s
mouthparts. Their data is shown in the graphs below. How
is this population evolving and what agent of evolution is
most likely at work?
