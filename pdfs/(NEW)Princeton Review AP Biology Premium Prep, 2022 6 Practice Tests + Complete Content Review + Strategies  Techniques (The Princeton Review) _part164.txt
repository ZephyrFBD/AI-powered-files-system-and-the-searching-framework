ds and regions of the peptide chain are
often located on the exterior of the protein. Hydrophobic amino acids and regions are usually found on the interior
of proteins. Sometimes, two cysteine amino acids can react with each other to form a covalent disulfide bond that
stabilizes the tertiary structure. Tertiary structure often minimizes the free energy of the molecule and locks it into a
stable 3D shape.
Lastly, several different polypeptide chains sometimes interact with each other to form a quaternary structure. The
different polypeptide chains that come together are often called subunits of the final whole protein.
A classic example of a protein with quaternary structure is hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a molecule in the blood that
helps distribute oxygen to the tissues in the body.
It is formed when four separate polypeptide chains interact with each other. Each of the four polypeptide chains
create a subunit of the final hemoglobin protein.
