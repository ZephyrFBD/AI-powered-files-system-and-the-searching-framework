odies and removing waste products. The circulatory system has evolved over time from simple diffusion through cells in
the early evolution of animals to a complex network of blood vessels that reach all parts of the human body. This extensive
network supplies the cells, tissues, and organs with oxygen and nutrients, and removes carbon dioxide and waste, which are
byproducts of respiration.
At the core of the human circulatory system is the heart. The size of a clenched fist, the human heart is protected beneath
the rib cage. Made of specialized and unique cardiac muscle, it pumps blood throughout the body and to the heart itself.
Heart contractions are driven by intrinsic electrical impulses that the brain and endocrine hormones help to regulate.
Understanding the heart’s basic anatomy and function is important to understanding the body’s circulatory and respiratory
systems. Because one in four deaths in the United States is due to heart disease, billions of dollars are spent each year
