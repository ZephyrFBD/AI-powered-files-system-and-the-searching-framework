 cellular activity is
reduced.
Receptor binding alters cellular activity and results in an increase or decrease in normal body processes. Depending on the
location of the protein receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone, hormones can mediate changes
directly by binding to intracellular hormone receptors and modulating gene transcription, or indirectly by binding to cell
surface receptors and stimulating signaling pathways.
Intracellular Hormone Receptors
Lipid-derived (soluble) hormones such as steroid hormones diffuse across the membranes of the endocrine cell. Once
outside the cell, they bind to transport proteins that keep them soluble in the bloodstream. At the target cell, the hormones

hormones pass through the plasma
