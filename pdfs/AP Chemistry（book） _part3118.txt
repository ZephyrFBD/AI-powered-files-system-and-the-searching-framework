 initial pressure of 0.750 atm? (b) If the final pres-
sure on the gas is 1.20 atm, calculate the entropy change 
for the process. (c) Do you need to specify the temperature 
to calculate the entropy change?
The Molecular Interpretation of Entropy and the 
Third Law of Thermodynamics (Section 19.3)
 19.29  For the isothermal expansion of a gas into a vacuum, 
∆E = 0, q = 0, and w = 0. (a) Is this a spontaneous pro-
cess? (b) Explain why no work is done by the system during 
this process. (c) What is the “driving force” for the expan-
sion of the gas: enthalpy or entropy?
 19.30  (a) What is the difference between a state and a microstate 
of a system? (b) As a system goes from state A to state B, its 
entropy decreases. What can you say about the number of 
microstates corresponding to each state? (c) In a particular 
spontaneous process, the number of microstates available 
to the system decreases. What can you conclude about the 
sign of ∆Ssurr?
