f inductance L (symbol 
) is connected to the
ac source. We ignore any resistance it might have (it is usually small). The voltage
applied to the inductor will be equal to the “back” emf generated in the inductor
by the changing current as given by Eq. 21–9. This is because the sum of the elec-
tric potential changes around any closed circuit must add up to zero, by Kirchhoff’s
rule. Thus
or
where V is the sinusoidally varying voltage of the source and
is the voltage
induced in the inductor. According to the last equation, I is increasing most
rapidly when V has its maximum value,
And I will be decreasing most
rapidly when
These two instants correspond to points d and b on the
graph of voltage versus time in Fig. 21–40b. By going point by point in this manner,
the curve of V versus as compared to that for I versus can be constructed, and
they are shown by the blue and red lines, respectively, in Fig. 21–40b. Notice that
the current reaches its peaks (and troughs)
cycle after the voltag
