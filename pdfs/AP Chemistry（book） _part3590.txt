l chrysotile is a noncarcinogenic asbestos mineral that is based on the sheet structure shown in Figure 22.32(c). In 
addition to silicate tetrahedra, the mineral contains Mg2 + and OH - ions. Analysis of the mineral shows that there are 1.5 Mg 
atoms per Si atom. What is the empirical formula for chrysotile?
Sample Exercise 22.6 
Determining an Empirical Formula
SOLUTION
Analyze A mineral is described that has a sheet silicate structure 
with Mg2 +  and OH -  ions to balance charge and 1.5 Mg for each 1 
Si. We are asked to write the empirical formula for the mineral.
Plan As shown in Figure 22.32(c), the silicate sheet structure has 
the simplest formula Si2O5
2 -. We first add Mg2 +  to give the proper 
Mg:Si ratio. We then add OH -  ions to obtain a neutral compound.
Solve
The observation that the Mg:Si ratio equals 1.5 is consistent with 
three Mg2 +  ions per Si2O5
2 - unit. The addition of three Mg2 +  ions 
would make Mg31Si2O524 +. In order to achieve charge balance in 
the mi
