66. A biologist studies a population of voles for 20 years.
During almost the entire research period, the population
stays between 50 and 75 individuals. Additionally, fewer
than half of the voles born do not survive to reproduce,
due to predation and competition for food. Then, in one
generation, 80% of the voles born live to reproduce. The
population increases to 110 individuals. What inferences
