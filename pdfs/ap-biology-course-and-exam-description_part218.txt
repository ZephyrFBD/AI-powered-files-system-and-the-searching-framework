Designing research to test biological 
systems is at the heart of this course. 
Students should be able to understand 
and evaluate experimental plans designed 
and conducted by others. They should be 
able to identify the experimental methods, 
measurements, and data collection methods 
used and articulate the hypothesis. They 
should also be able to plan and implement 
data collection strategies that test biological 
systems, in order to understand and develop 
solutions to problems within biological 
systems. An understanding of how to design 
experiments that test biological systems 
is demonstrated by the ability to interpret 
the results of an experiment in relation to 
a hypothesis. Sometimes, experimental 
procedures will need to be modified in order 
to collect appropriate data; students should 
understand how to modify a procedure to 
collect data and test a hypothesis.
