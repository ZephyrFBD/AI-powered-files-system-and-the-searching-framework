4.4 ∣ Oxidation-Reduction Reactions
In precipitation reactions, cations and anions come together to form an insoluble ionic 
compound. In neutralization reactions, protons are transferred from one reactant to an-
other. Now let’s consider a third kind of reaction, one in which electrons are transferred 
from one reactant to another. Such reactions are called either oxidation-reduction re-
actions or redox reactions. In this chapter we concentrate on redox reactions where 
one of the reactants is a metal in its elemental form. Redox reactions are critical in under-
standing many biological and geological processes in the world around us; they also form 
the basis for energy-related technologies such as batteries and fuel cells (Chapter 20).
Oxidation and Reduction
One of the most familiar redox reactions is corrosion of a metal (Figure 4.11). In some in-
stances, corrosion is
