the virus
exploits the cellular machinery of the bacterium to produce additional phages, causing
the bacterial cell to lyse and release the new viruses. Thus, because the lytic cycle kills
the host but the lysogenic does not, (D) is correct.

Oxidation of pyruvate, which produces a lot of ATP, occurs during aerobic respiration but
not fermentation. (B) is thus correct. (A) and (C) are factually accurate but fail to explain
the diﬀerence in ATP generation. (D) is true but misleading: molecules are not
transported into mitochondria during fermentation, but only during aerobic respiration.
However, the energy cost of transport across mitochondrial membranes is outweighed
by the energy generated from oxidizing pyruvate.

The question stem gives the original distribution of bird beak length, and asks what
would happen if the insect on which the bird feeds begins burrowing deeper into the soil.
This suggests that there would be selection for birds with longer beaks and against bird
