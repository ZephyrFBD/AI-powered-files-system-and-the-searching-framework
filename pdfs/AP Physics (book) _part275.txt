ow, we use Eq.2–11b (Tables 3–1 and 3–2)
for the vertical (y) direction with

We solve for and set
To calculate the initial velocity,
we again use Eq. 2–11b, but this time for
the horizontal (x) direction, with

Then
which is about

NOTE In the time interval of the projectile motion, the only acceleration is g in
the negative y direction. The acceleration in the x direction is zero.
