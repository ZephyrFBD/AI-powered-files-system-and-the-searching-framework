15%. By what percentage does the power delivered to the
headlights vary as the voltage changes from 12 V to 13.8 V?
Assume the headlight resistance remains constant.
82. A tungsten filament used in a flashlight bulb operates at

requires larger diameter wires to connect its power source
and the bulb?
84. An air conditioner draws 18 A at 220-V ac. The connecting
cord is copper wire with a diameter of 1.628 mm. (a) How
much power does the air conditioner draw? (b) If the
