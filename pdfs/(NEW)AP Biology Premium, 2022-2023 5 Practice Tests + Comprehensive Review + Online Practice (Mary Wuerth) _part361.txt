tion in a cell: DNA is transcribed into mRNA;
mRNA is then translated into proteins by ribosomes. This chapter will review the processes of transcription and
translation and explore how these processes are similar or different in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Transcription in Prokaryotes vs. Transcription in Eukaryotes
Transcription is the process in which the genetic information in a sequence of DNA nucleotides is copied into
newly synthesized RNA molecules. RNA polymerase is the enzyme that transcribes a DNA sequence into RNA
molecules. The function of an RNA molecule depends on its structure and sequence:
■mRNA (messenger RNA) is single-stranded and carries information from DNA to the ribosome. mRNA
contains three base pair sequences called codons, which are complementary to the DNA base pair sequence.
These codons will specify specific amino acids during translation.
■tRNA (transfer RNA) folds into a three-dimensional structure that acts as an adapter molecule during
translation. One
