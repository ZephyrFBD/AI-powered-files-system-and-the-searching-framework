acity to do work or transfer heat. Work is the energy transferred 
when a force exerted on an object causes a displacement of that ob-
ject, and heat is the energy used to cause the temperature of an object 
to increase. An object can possess energy in two forms: kinetic energy, 
which is the energy associated with the motion of an object, and 
 
potential energy, which is the energy that an object possesses by virtue 
of its position relative to other objects. Important forms of potential 
energy include gravitational energy and electrostatic energy.
UNITS OF MEASUREMENT (SECTION 1.5) Measurements in chem-
istry are made using the metric system. Special emphasis is placed on SI 
units, which are based on the meter, the kilogram, and the second as the 
basic units of length, mass, and time, respectively. SI units use prefixes to 
indicate fractions or multiples of base units. The SI temperature scale is the 
Kelvin scale, although the Celsius scale is frequently used as well. Absolute
