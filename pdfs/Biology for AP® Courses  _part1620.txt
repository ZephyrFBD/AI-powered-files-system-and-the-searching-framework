Objective
3.1 The student is able to construct scientific explanations that use the structure and
functions of DNA and RNA to support the claim that DNA and, in some cases, that RNA are
the primary sources of heritable information.
The Science Practice Challenge Questions contain additional test questions for this section that will help you prepare for
the AP exam. These questions address the following standards:
[APLO 3.4][APLO 3.25]
The cellular process of transcription generates messenger RNA (mRNA), a mobile molecular copy of one or more
genes with an alphabet of A, C, G, and uracil (U). Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic
information into a protein product. Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be
said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters (Figure 15.2). Each amino acid is defined by a three-nucleotide sequence
called the triplet codon. Different amino acids have differe
