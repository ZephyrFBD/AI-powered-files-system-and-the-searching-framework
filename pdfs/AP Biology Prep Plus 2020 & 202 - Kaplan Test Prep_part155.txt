et, the more important role the pump plays is that it helps to control the
solute concentration within the cytoplasm of cells, thereby preventing
cells from shrinking or swelling too much when the extracellular
environment becomes too hypertonic or hypotonic. 
Another ion that you may see on the exam is Ca2+ (calcium), which is kept
in extremely low concentrations in cell cytoplasm, yet is stored in high
concentrations within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This is done by
using Ca2+-ATPase pumps, embedded in the ER membrane, to actively
transport calcium from the cytoplasm into the ER lumen. This naturally
sets up a strong calcium gradient across the ER membrane that is used,
for example, by muscle cells to regulate muscle contraction. When
depolarized by an action potential from a nerve cell, the specialized ER of
muscle cells (called the sarcoplasmic reticulum) releases its store of
calcium ions, flooding the cytoplasm with Ca2+ and leading to rapid
contraction of the cell. Because
