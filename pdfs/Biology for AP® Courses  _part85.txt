Other less complex organisms have also been studied as part of this project in order to gain a better understanding of human
chromosomes. The Human Genome Project (Figure 1.9) relied on basic research carried out with simple organisms and,
later, with the human genome. An important end goal eventually became using the data for applied research, seeking cures
and early diagnoses for genetically related diseases.

Figure 1.9 The Human Genome Project was a 13-year collaborative effort among researchers working in several
different fields of science. The project, which sequenced the entire human genome, was completed in 2003. (credit:

While research efforts in both basic science and applied science are usually carefully planned, it is important to note that
some discoveries are
