Because there are 0.858 moles of ethanol in 1.00 L of beer, the concentration of eth-
anol in beer is 0.86 M (taking into account significant figures).
 
Sample Exercise 4.13 
Using Molarity to Calculate Grams of Solute
How many grams of Na2SO4 are required to make 0.350 L of 0.500 M Na2SO4?
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
What is the concentration of ammonia in a solution made  
by dissolving 3.75 g of ammonia in 120.0 L of water?  
(a) 1.84 * 10-3 M (b) 3.78 * 10-2 M (c) 0.0313 M (d) 1.84 M 
(e) 7.05 M
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
(a) How many grams of Na2SO4 are there in 15 mL of 
0.50 M Na2SO4? (b) How many milliliters of 0.50 M Na2SO4 
solution are needed to provide 0.038 mol of this salt?
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the volume of the solution (0.350 L), its con-
centration (0.500 M), and the identity of the solute Na2SO4 an
