s pC1, pC2, and pC3 are
closest to ___.
a.
pC1 = 0.57 pC2 = 0.57 pC3 = 0.59
b.
pC1 = 0.29 pC2 = 0.29 pC3 = 0.42
c.
pC1 = 0.61 pC2 = 0.80 pC3 = 0.59
d.
pC1 = 0.31 pC2 = 0.40 pC3 = 0.29
E. In order to investigate the presence of selection at the
cellulase locus due to changing temperature, a biologist
should:
a.
calculate the values of the sums pC1 + pC2 + pC3
and (pC1 + pC2 + pC3)2. If these numbers are not
equal to 1, the gene is not in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium, and the gene is evolving.
b.
return next year and repeat this examination of
the enzyme, calculating frequencies of each
allele each year. Then calculate the values of the
sums pC1 + pC2 + pC3 and (pC1 + pC2 + pC3)2. If
these numbers are not the same each year, the
gene is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and
the gene is evolving.
c.
return each year for several years and repeat this
examination of the enzyme, calculating
frequencies of each allele each year. If the allele
frequencies are changing, the gene is not in
Hardy-
