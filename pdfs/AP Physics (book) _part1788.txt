FIGURE 16–42 Inside a laser
printer: a movable mirror sweeps
the laser beam in horizontal lines
across the drum.
A laser printer uses a computer output to program the intensity of a laser
beam onto the selenium-coated drum of Fig. 16–42. The thin beam of light from
the laser is scanned (by a movable mirror) from side to side across the drum in a
series of horizontal lines, each line just below the previous line. As the beam
sweeps across the drum, the intensity of the beam is varied by the computer
output, being strong for a point that is meant to be white or bright, and weak or zero
for points that are meant to come out dark. After each sweep, the drum rotates very
slightly for additional sweeps, Fig. 16–42, until a complete image is formed on it.
The light parts of the selenium become conducting and lose their (previously
given) positive electric charge, and the toner sticks only to the
