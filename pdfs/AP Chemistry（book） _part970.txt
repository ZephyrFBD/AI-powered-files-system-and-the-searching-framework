Beryllium and Boron The element that follows lithium is beryllium; its electron con-
figuration is 1s22s2 (Table 6.3). Boron, atomic number 5, has the electron configuration 
1s22s22p1. The fifth electron must be placed in a 2p orbital because the 2s orbital is filled. 
Because all three of the 2p orbitals are of equal energy, it does not matter which 2p orbital 
we place this fifth electron in.
Carbon With the next element, carbon, we encounter a new situation. We know that 
the sixth electron must go into a 2p orbital. However, does this new electron go into the 
2p orbital that already has one electron or into one of the other two 2p orbitals?
Hundâ€™s rule states that that when filling degenerate orbitals the lowest energy is 
attained when the number of electrons having the same spin is maximized. 
This means that electrons occupy orbitals singly to the maximum extent possible and 
that these single electrons in a given subshell all h
