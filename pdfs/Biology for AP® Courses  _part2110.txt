ls and not on the individual.
To test the claim that selection was acting on the
multicellular system and not just individual cells, the
investigators compared the effects on a population of yeast
that had acquired multicellularity by strong selection
(allowing only 5 minutes to settle) and weak selection
(allowing 25 minutes to settle). A strong selection
increased cluster size, and a weak selection decreased
cluster size.
A. Evaluate the claim that the use of both a strong and
weak selection demonstrates that evolution is an ongoing
process that, under artificially imposed conditions, led to
the emergence of multicellularity in a single-celled
organism.
B. In this directed evolution study, the selection pressure
imposed by the investigators led to a new phenotype.
Consider a situation in which there is a vertical variation in
the density of nutritional resources. Analyze the
advantages and disadvantages of cooperative behavior,
including changes in the likelihood of replication of th
