one terminal of the battery is called “ground,” but is not connected to the earth
itself—it is connected to the frame of the car, as is one connection to each lightbulb
and other devices. Thus the car frame is a conductor in each circuit, ensuring a
continuous path for charge flow, and is called “ground” for the car’s circuits.
(Note that the car frame is well insulated from the earth by the rubber tires.)
We saw in Chapter 16 that conductors contain many free electrons. Thus, if a
continuous conducting wire is connected to the terminals of a battery, negatively
charged electrons flow in the wire. When the wire is first connected, the potential
difference between the terminals of the battery sets up an electric field inside the
wire and parallel to it. Free electrons at one end of the wire are attracted into 
the positive terminal, and at the same time other electrons enter the other end of the
wire at the negative terminal of the battery. There is a continuous flow of electrons
