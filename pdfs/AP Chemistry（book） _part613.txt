tensely colored than the concentrated one.
*In diluting a concentrated acid or base, the acid or base should be added to water and then 
 
further diluted by adding more water. Adding water directly to concentrated acid or base can cause 
 
spattering because of the intense heat generated.

Give It Some Thought
How is the molarity of a 0.50 M KBr solution changed when water is added  
to double its volume?

CHAPTER 4 Reactions in Aqueous Solution
In laboratory situations, calculations of this sort are often made with an equation 
derived by remembering that the number of moles of solute is the same in both the con-
centrated and dilute solutions and that moles = molar
