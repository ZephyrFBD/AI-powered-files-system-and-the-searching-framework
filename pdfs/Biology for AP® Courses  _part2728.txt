taproot. The growing root tip is protected by a root cap. The root tip has three main zones: a zone of cell division (cells are
actively dividing), a zone of elongation (cells increase in length), and a zone of maturation (cells differentiate to form
different kinds of cells). Root vascular tissue conducts water, minerals, and sugars. In some habitats, the roots of certain
plants may be modified to form aerial roots or epiphytic roots.
23.4 Leaves
Leaves are the main site of photosynthesis. A typical leaf consists of a lamina (the broad part of the leaf, also called the
blade) and a petiole (the stalk that attaches the leaf to a stem). The arrangement of leaves on a stem, known as phyllotaxy,
enables maximum exposure to sunlight. Each plant species has a characteristic leaf arrangement and form. The pattern of
leaf arrangement may be alternate, opposite, or spiral, while leaf form may be simple or compound. Leaf tissue consists of
the epidermis, which forms the outermost cell layer, an
