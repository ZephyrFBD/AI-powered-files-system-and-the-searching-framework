te that the equilibrium constant itself does not change; it is the relative concentrations 
of products and reactants in the equilibrium expression that change.
What is the pH of a solution made by adding 0.30 mol of acetic acid and 0.30 mol of sodium acetate to enough water  
to make 1.0 L of solution?
Sample Exercise 17.1 
Calculating the pH When a Common Ion Is Involved
718 
 
SECTION 17.1  The Common-Ion Effect 
719
Analyze We are asked to determine the pH of a solution of a weak 
electrolyte 1CH3COOH2 and a strong electrolyte 1CH3COONa2 
that share a common ion, CH3COO-.
Plan In any problem in which we must determine the pH of a solu-
tion containing a mixture of solutes, it is helpful to proceed by a 
series of logical steps:
(1) Consider which solutes are strong electrolytes and which are 
weak electrolytes, and identify the major species in solution.
SOLUTION
(2) Identify the important equilibrium reaction that is the source 
of H+ and therefore determines pH.
(3) Tabulate the
