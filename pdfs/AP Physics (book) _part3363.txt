rino has zero charge, spin of 
and was long thought to have zero mass,
although today we are quite sure that it has a very tiny mass 
If its
mass were zero, it would be much like a photon in that it is neutral and would
travel at the speed of light. But the neutrino is very difficult to detect. In 1956,
complex experiments produced further evidence for the existence of the neutrino;
but by then, most physicists had already accepted its existence.
The symbol for the neutrino is the Greek letter nu 
The correct way of
writing the decay of 
is then
The bar 
over the neutrino symbol is to indicate that it is an “antineutrino.”
(Why this is called an antineutrino rather than simply a neutrino is discussed in
Chapter 32.)
