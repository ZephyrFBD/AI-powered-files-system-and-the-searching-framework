 predation. What would you expect to happen if you moved fish from area 2 back
to area 3? What would you expect to happen in each area if female fish began to prefer larger fish rather than more
brightly colored fish?
In monogamous systems, one male and one female are paired for at least one breeding season. In some animals, such as the
gray wolf, these associations can last much longer, even a lifetime. Several explanations have been proposed for this type of
mating system. The “mate-guarding hypothesis” states that males stay with the female to prevent other males from mating
with her. This behavior is advantageous in such situations where mates are scarce and difficult to find. Another explanation
is the “male-assistance hypothesis,” where males that remain with a female to help guard and rear their young will have
more and healthier offspring. Monogamy is observed in many bird populations where, in addition to the parental care
from the female, the male is also a major provider of
