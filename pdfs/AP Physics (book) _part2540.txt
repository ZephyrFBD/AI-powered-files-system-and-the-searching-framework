y diagram even though you are
going to make an analytic calculation—the diagram
serves as a check, even if not precise. From one point
on the object, draw at least two, preferably three, of
the easy-to-draw rays using the rules described in
Fig.23–15. The image point is where the reflected rays
intersect (real image) or appear to intersect (virtual).
2. Apply the mirror equation, Eq.23–2, and the magni-
fication equation, Eq. 23–3. It is crucially important
to follow the sign conventions—see the next point.
†Object distances are positive for material objects, but can be negative in systems with more than one mirror or lens—see Section 23–9.
Convex Mirrors
The analysis used for concave mirrors can be applied to convex mirrors. Even the
mirror equation (Eq. 23–2) holds for a convex mirror, although the quantities
involved must be carefully defined. Figure 23–19a shows parallel rays falling on
a convex mirror. Again spherical aberration is significant (Fig. 23–13), unless we
assume the mi
