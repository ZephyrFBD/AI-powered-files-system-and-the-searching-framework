 of the 
quaternary structure when two or more subunits unite to form a larger protein. A good 
example of a quaternary protein is hemoglobin, which is made up of two α and two ß 
subunits associated with four molecules of heme (a nonpolypeptide component), each of 
which contains an iron atom that binds oxygen. 
Enzymatic proteins are fundamental to the survival of any living system and are 
organized into a number of groups depending on their specific activities. Two common 
groups are catabolic enzymes (“cata-” or “kata-” from the Greek word for “break down”; 
for instance, amylase breaks complex starches into simple sugars) and anabolic enzymes 
(“a-” or “an-” from the Greek word anabole, meaning to “build up”). You can remind 
students of stories about athletes who have been caught using anabolic steroids to build 
muscle. 
Catalytic enzymes that break down proteins, which are called proteases, are found 
in many organisms; one example is bromelain, which comes from pineapple and
