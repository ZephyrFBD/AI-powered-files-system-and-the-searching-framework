 glass beads only; the readings taken from these respirometers are essential for 
correcting the readings of the other respirometers.

As stated previously, rates of cellular respiration also can be determined using gas 
pressure sensors with a computer interface. Instructions, tips, and suggestions for most 
accurate usage of these devices can be found in the instructions that are provided with 
the purchase of the equipment. 
■ THE INVESTIGATIONS 
■ Getting Started: Prelab Assessment 
You may assign the following questions for homework; as a think, pair/group, share 
activity, in which pairs or small groups of students brainstorm ideas and then share them 
with other groups; or as a whole-class discussion to assess students’ understanding of key 
concepts pertaining to cellular respiration: 
1. Why is it necessary to correct the readings of the respirometers containing seeds 
with the readings taken from respiromet
