All organisms, from bacteria to complex animals, must be able to store, retrieve, and transmit genetic information to
continue life. In later chapters, we will explore how a cell’s genetic information encoded in DNA, its genome, is replicated
and passed to the next generation to direct the production of proteins, determining an organism’s traits. Prokaryotes have
single circular chromosome of DNA, whereas eukaryotes have multiple, linear chromosomes composed of chromatin (DNA
wrapped around a histone protein) surrounded by a nuclear membrane. Cell division involves both mitosis, the division of
the chromosomes, and cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm. Human somatic cells consist of 46 chromosomes—22
pairs of autosomal chromosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes. Prior to mitosis, each chromosome is duplicated to ensure
that daughter cells receive the full amount of hereditary material contributed by both parents. The total number of autosomal
