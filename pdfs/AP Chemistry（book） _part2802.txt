ng electrolyte that provides an ion common 
to the equilibrium (the common-ion effect).
BUFFERS (SECTION 17.2) A particularly important type of 
acid–base mixture is that of a weak conjugate acid–base pair that 
functions as a buffered solution (buffer). Addition of small amounts 
of a strong acid or a strong base to a buffered solution causes only 
small changes in pH because the buffer reacts with the added 
acid or base. (Strong acid–strong base, strong acid–weak base, and 
weak acid–strong base reactions proceed essentially to comple-
tion.) Buffered solutions are usually prepared from a weak acid 
and a salt of that acid or from a weak base and a salt of that base. 
Two important characteristics of a buffered solution are its buffer 
capacity and its pH range. The optimal pH of a buffer is equal to 
pKa (or pKb) of the acid (or base) used to prepare the buffer. The 
relationship between pH, pKa, and the concentrations of an acid 
and its conjugate base can be expressed by the Hend
