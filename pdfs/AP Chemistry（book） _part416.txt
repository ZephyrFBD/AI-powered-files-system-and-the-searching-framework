en-containing 
derivatives form CO2 and H2O when they burn in air summarizes the reactions of about 3 
million compounds with oxygen. Many substances that our bodies use as energy sources, 
such as the sugar glucose 1C6H12O62, react with O2 to form CO2 and H2O. In our bodies, 
however, the reactions take place in a series of intermediate steps that occur at body 
temperature. These reactions that involve intermediate steps are described as oxidation 
reactions instead of combustion reactions.
▲ Figure 3.8 Propane burning in air. 
Liquid propane in the tank, C3H8, vaporizes 
and mixes with air as it escapes through the 
nozzle. The combustion reaction of C3H8 
and O2 produces a blue flame.
