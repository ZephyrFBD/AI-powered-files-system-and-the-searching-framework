 in the longest chain, beginning with the end 
nearest a substituent. In our example, we number the C atoms beginning at the 
upper right because that places the CH3 substituent on C2 of the chain. (If we had 
numbered from the lower right, the CH3 would be on C5.) The chain is numbered 
from the end that gives the lower number to the substituent position.
 
3. Name each substituent. A substituent formed by removing an H atom from an 
alkane is called an alkyl group. Alkyl groups are named by replacing the -ane end-
ing of the alkane name with -yl. The methyl group 1CH32, for example, is derived 
from methane 1CH42 and the ethyl group 1C2H52 is derived from ethane 1C2H62. 
Table 24.4 lists six common alkyl groups.
 
4. Begin the name with the number or numbers of the carbon or carbons to 
which each substituent is bonded. For our compound, the name 2-methylhexane 
 
indicates the presence of a methyl group on C2 of a hexane (six-carbon) chain.
