 potential in the course of your investigations, think about these questions. 
•  What would happen if you applied saltwater to the roots of a plant? Why? 
•  What are two different ways a plant could control turgor pressure, a name for internal 
water potential within its cells? Is this a sufficient definition for turgor pressure? 
•  Will water move into or out of a plant cell if the cell has a higher water potential than 
its surrounding environment? 
Step 1 Start by looking at a single leaf blade from either Elodea (a water plant) or a leaf-
like structure from Mnium hornum (a moss) under the light microscope. If you need 
assistance, your teacher will show you how to place specimens on a slide. 
•  Where is the cell membrane in relation to the cell wall? Can you see the two  
structures easily? Why or why not?  
•  What parts of the cell that you see control the water concentration inside the cell?
