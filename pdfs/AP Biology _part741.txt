acrophage,
dendritic cell, or B cellâ€”takes in an antigen. Either the APC becomes
infected with the antigen or engulfs it. Once inside the host, enzymes break
apart the antigen into fragments and attach them to an MHC molecule in
the cytoplasm. The MHC molecule, with the antigen fragment attached,
then moves to the surface of the cell and displays it. Other cells of the
immune system, such as T cells or other B cells, become activated if they
can properly bind with the exposed epitope.
Clonal Selection
Clonal selection is a fundamental mechanism in the development of
immunity. It is the means by which one particular lymphocyte that
matches a specific antigen or epitope (also called antigenic determinant)
is identified and activated. See Figure 17.2.
An antigen is presented to a steady stream of lymphocytes in lymph
nodes by APCs (antigen-presenting cells) until a match is found. This
triggers events that activate the lymphocyte. Once activated, the
lymphocyte divides rapidly, forming a
