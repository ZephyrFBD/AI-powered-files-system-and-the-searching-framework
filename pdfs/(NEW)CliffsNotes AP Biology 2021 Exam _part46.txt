adhesion. Adhesion is the attraction of unlike substances. This results from the attraction of the
poles of water molecules to other polar substances. If you wet your finger, you can easily pick up a straight pin by
touching it because the water on your finger adheres to both your skin and the pin. Similarly, some people wet their
fingers to help them turn pages. When water adheres to the walls of narrow tubing or to absorbent solids like paper,
it demonstrates capillary action by rising up the tubing or creeping through the paper.
Organic Molecules
Organic molecules are those that have carbon atoms. In living systems, large organic molecules, called
macromolecules, may consist of hundreds or thousands of atoms. Most macromolecules are polymers, molecules
that consist of a single unit (monomer) repeated many times.
Four of carbonâ€™s six electrons are available to form bonds with other atoms. Thus, you will always see four lines
connecting a carbon atom to other atoms, each line represen
