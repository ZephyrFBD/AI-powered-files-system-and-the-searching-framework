one ATP
molecule releases 7.3 kcal/mol of free energy (ΔG = -7.3
kcal/mol). If it takes 2.1 kcal/mol of free energy to move
one Na+ across the membrane (ΔG = +2.1 kcal/mol), how
many sodium ions could be moved by the hydrolysis of
one ATP molecule? Show your calculations to provide
reasoning for your answer.
64. Is the EA for ATP hydrolysis in cells likely relatively
low or high compared to the EA for the combustion of
gasoline in an internal combustion engine?
1.
Explain your reasoning in terms of the relative
stabilities of ATP and gasoline compared to air
in which no catalysts are present.
2.
Describe how the role of the enzyme ATPase in
the hydrolysis of ATP in a cell differs from a
spark in the cylinder of an internal combustion
engine.
3.
Describe a strategy for collecting data that can
be used to measure the energies of activation
(EA) of each of these two processes with
instruments that can measure concentrations of
reactions produced in each system.
