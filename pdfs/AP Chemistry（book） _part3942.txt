In working with exponents, it is important to recall that 100 = 1. The following 
rules are useful for carrying exponents through calculations.
1. Addition and Subtraction In order to add or subtract numbers expressed in 
 
exponential notation, the powers of 10 must be the same.
 15.22 * 1042 + 13.21 * 1022 = 1522 * 1022 + 13.21 * 1022
  = 525 * 102 13 significant figures2
 = 5.25 * 104
 16.25 * 10-22 - 15.77 * 10-32 = 16.25 * 10-22 - 10.577 * 10-22
 = 5.67 * 10-2 13 significant figures2
 
 
When you use a calculator to add or subtract, you need not be concerned with hav-
ing numbers with the same exponents because the calculator automatically takes 
care of this matter.
2. Multiplication and Division When numbers expressed in exponential notation 
are multiplied, the exponents are added; when numbers expressed in exponential 
notation are divided, the exponent of the denominator is subtracted from the expo-
nent of the numerator.
 15.4 * 102212.1 * 1032 = 15.4212.
