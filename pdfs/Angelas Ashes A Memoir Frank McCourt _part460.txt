r and brothers, God bless Ireland, God bless De 
 
 Valera, and God bless anyone who gives Dad a job. He says,Go to sleep, 
 
 boys, because holy God is watching you and He always knows if you’re 
 
 not good. 
 
 I think my father is like the Holy Trinity with three people in him, 
 
 the one in the morning with the paper, the one at night with the stories 
 
 and the prayers, and then the one who does the bad thing and 
 
 comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland. 
 
 I feel sad over the bad thing but I can’t back away from him because 
 
 the one in the morning is my real father and if I were in America I 
 
 could say, I love you, Dad, the way they do in the films, but you can’t 
 
 say that in Limerick for fear you might be laughed at.You’re allowed to 
 
  
  
 say you love God and babies and horses that win but anything else is a 
 
 softness in the head. 
 
 Day and night we’re tormented in that kitchen with people emptying 
 
 their buckets. Mam say
