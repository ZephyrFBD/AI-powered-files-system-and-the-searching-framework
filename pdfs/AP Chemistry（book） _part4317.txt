and B combine to 
form more than one compound, the masses of B that can combine 
with a given mass of A are in the ratio of small whole numbers.
Le Châtelier’s principle A principle stating that when we disturb 
a system at chemical equilibrium, the relative concentrations of 
reactants and products shift so as to partially undo the effects of 
the disturbance. (Section 15.7)
levorotatory, or merely levo or l A term used to label a chiral 
molecule that rotates the plane of polarization of plane-
polarized light to the left (counterclockwise). (Section 24.4)
Lewis acid An electron-pair acceptor. (Section 16.11)
Lewis base An electron-pair donor. (Section 16.11)
Lewis structure A representation of covalent bonding in a 
molecule that is drawn using Lewis symbols. Shared electron pairs 
are shown as lines, and unshared electron pairs are shown as pairs 
of dots. Only the valence-shell electrons are shown. (Section 8.3)
Lewis symbol (electron-dot symbol) The chemical symbol for an
