Organismal Ecology
Researchers studying ecology at the organismal level are interested in the adaptations that enable individuals to live in
specific habitats. These adaptations can be morphological, physiological, and behavioral. For instance, the Karner blue
butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) (Figure 35.3) is considered a specialist because the females preferentially oviposit
(that is, lay eggs) on wild lupine. This preferential adaptation means that the Karner blue butterfly is highly dependent on
the presence of wild lupine plants for its continued survival.
Figure 35.3 The Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) is a rare butterfly that lives only in open areas
with few trees or shrubs, such as pine barrens and oak savannas. It can only lay its eggs on lupine plants. (credit:
