onnecting the experimental results to the structure and function of proteins. 
(3 points maximum; LO 4.22, 4.17, 4.14) 
Estimated (1 point) 
Optimal pH of enzyme is 7 OR greater than 5 and less than 9
Explanation (2 points maximum) 
Evidence (1 point) 
Reaction at the optimal 
•
Reaction at the optimal pH value has the highest absorbance/
amount of product produced
Other pH values had lower absorbance/produce less product
•
Other pH values had lower absorbance/produce less product
Justification (1 point) 
A change in pH... 
• alters the structure of the enzyme’s active site and reduces its
activity 
• alters the charge of R-groups and reduces the enzyme’s activity
• disrupts substrate binding and/or catalytic mechanism and reduces
it
ivity
• denatures the enzyme and reduces its activity
(c) Propose an appropriate control treatment for the experiment, and describe how the control 
treatment would increase the validity of the results. (2 points maximum; LO2.22, 2.23)
