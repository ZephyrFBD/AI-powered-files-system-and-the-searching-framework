from a nozzle of diameter 0.60 cm (Fig. 10–57). The pump
at the base of the unit (1.1 m below the nozzle) pushes
water into a 1.2-cm-diameter supply pipe that goes up to
the nozzle. What gauge pressure does the pump have to
provide? Ignore the viscosity; your answer will therefore
be an underestimate.

98. You need to siphon water from a clogged sink. The sink has
an area of 
and is filled to a height of 4.0 cm. Your
siphon tube rises 45 cm above the bottom of the sink and
then descends 85 cm to a pail as shown in Fig. 10–59. The
siphon tube has a diameter of 2.3 cm. (a) Assuming that
the water level in the sink has almost zero velocity, use
Bernoulli’s equation to estimate the water velocity when it
enters the pail. (b) Estimate how long it will take to empty
the sink. Ignore viscosity.
