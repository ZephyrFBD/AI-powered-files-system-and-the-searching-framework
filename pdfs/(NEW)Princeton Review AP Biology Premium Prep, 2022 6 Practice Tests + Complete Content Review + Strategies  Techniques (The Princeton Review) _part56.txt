Section I: Multiple Choice
1.
B
Adding salt would increase the osmolality (a similar measure to osmolarity) and since Organism 4 is an
osmoconformer it would change its intracellular osmolality/osmolarity to mimic the surroundings. This
means that it would increase its osmolality and maintain it unless further changes are made to the system.
2.
B
The only choice that has direct ties to maintaining osmotic balance is the sodium-potassium pump.
3.
D
Since the organisms mimic their surroundings, the only choice that would decrease their osmolalities
would be one that decreases the osmolality of their surrounding tank. Choice (A) increases the tank
osmolality. Choices (B) and (C) directly increase the organism osmolality. Choice (D) decreases the
