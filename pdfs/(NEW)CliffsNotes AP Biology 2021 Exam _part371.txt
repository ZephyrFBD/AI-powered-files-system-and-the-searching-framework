Genetic engineering in plants. Genes have been inserted into agricultural plants that provide resistance to pests and
herbicides and tolerance to drought and other extreme environmental conditions. In other cases, genetic engineering
has changed fruit color, increased crop yields, or extended shelf life. For example, several genetically modified
(GM) crops, including corn (Bt corn), carry the Bt gene that gives plants insecticide properties. The gene, whose
origin is the plasmid of a soil bacterium (Bacillus thuringiensis, Bt), produces a chemical that is toxic only to certain
insects. This reduces the need for pesticides, which often kill insects indiscriminately as well as their natural
predators. Often, however, other insects not killed by the Bt toxin increase in numbers, requiring, once again, the
application of insecticides. In addition, insects once susceptible to Bt toxin evolve resistance to the toxin. Also, in
so
