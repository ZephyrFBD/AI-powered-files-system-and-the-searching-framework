rams per mole of the 
substance. Because we know the sample has a mass of 
3.50 mg = 3.50 * 10-3 g, we can calculate the molar mass by 
dividing the number of grams in the sample by the number of 
moles we just calculated:
Molar mass =
grams
moles =
3.50 * 10-3 g
4.14 * 10-7 mol
= 8.45 * 103 g>mol
Comment Because small pressures can be measured easily and ac-
curately, osmotic pressure measurements provide a useful way to 
determine the molar masses of large molecules.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Proteins frequently form complexes in which 2, 3, 4, or 
even more individual proteins (“monomers”) interact spe-
cifically with each other via hydrogen bonds or electrostatic 
interactions. The entire assembly of proteins can act as one 
unit in solution, and this assembly is called the “quater-
nary structure” of the protein. Suppose you discover a new 
protein whose monomer molar mass is 25,000 g>mol. You 
measure an osmotic pressure of 0.0916 atm at 37 °C for 7.20 g 
of the protein in 10.00 mL
