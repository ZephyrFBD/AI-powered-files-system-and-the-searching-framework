t area) of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to
incomplete ingestion of food, energy used for respiration, and energy lost as waste. Incomplete ingestion refers to the fact
that some consumers eat only a part of their food. For example, when a lion kills an antelope, it will eat everything except
the hide and bones. The lion is missing the energy-rich bone marrow inside the bone, so the lion does not make use of all
the calories its prey could provide.
Thus, NPE measures how efficiently each trophic level uses and incorporates the energy from its food into biomass to fuel
the next trophic level. In general, cold-blooded animals (ectotherms), such as invertebrates, fish, amphibians, and reptiles,
use less of the energy they obtain for respiration and heat than warm-blooded animals (endotherms), such as birds and
mammals. The extra heat generated in endotherms, although an advantage in terms of the activity of these organisms in
colder environments, is a
