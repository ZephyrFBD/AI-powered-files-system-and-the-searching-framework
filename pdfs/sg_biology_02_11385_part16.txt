Method of transport 
needs to be  
specific (diffusion/ 
facilitated/active) 
 
 
Tissue or organ 
must have function 
related to material 
being transported 
Examples: aortic 
arch/pseudoheart, 
muscular activity, 
muscular 
contraction 
Semi-permeable, transport 
proteins, elaborate 
description of structure 
 
 
 
Tissue or organ must be 
described to show how 
structure relates to function. 
Example, dorsal, ventral, 
segmental, conducting tubes, 
muscular, five pairs 
* Importance of material 
transport 
 
 
 
 
* Maintain optimal 
concentration gradients, 
permits for larger body 
size and complexity
