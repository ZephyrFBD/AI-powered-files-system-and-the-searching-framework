into thin 
sheets, and ductile, which means that they can be drawn into wires (Figure 12.10). These 
properties indicate that the atoms are capable of slipping past one another. Ionic and 
covalent-network solids do not exhibit such behavior; they are typically brittle.

Gold leaf demonstrates the characteristic 
malleability of metals, and copper wire 
demonstrates their ductility.
Give It Some Thought
Atoms in metals easily slip past one another as mechanical force is applied; can 
you think of why this would not be true for ionic solids?

the Structures of Metallic Solids
The crystal structures of many metals are simple and can be generated by placing a sin-
gle atom on each lattice point. The structures corresponding to the three cubic lattices 
are shown in Figure 12.11. Metals with a primitive cubic structure are rare, one of the few 
examples being the radioactive element polonium. Body-centered cubic metals include 
iron, ch
