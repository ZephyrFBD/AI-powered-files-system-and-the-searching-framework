tations at the each end of intron and exon, or in the proteins and RNAs that make up the spliceosome,
may occur. Mutations may also add new spliceosome recognition sites and delete existing sites.
Note that more than 70 individual introns can be present, and each has to undergo the process of splicing—in addition to 5'
capping and the addition of a poly-A tail—just to generate a single, translatable mRNA molecule.

Explain why helper proteins are necessary for the formation of the final protein during RNA splicing in higher
organisms.
a.
Helper proteins attach themselves to the ends of introns so that they can be spliced out during RNA splicing
and coded areas are spliced together to form mRNA which then codes for the final protein.
b.
Helper proteins attach themselves to the ends of exons so that they can be spliced out during RNA splicing
