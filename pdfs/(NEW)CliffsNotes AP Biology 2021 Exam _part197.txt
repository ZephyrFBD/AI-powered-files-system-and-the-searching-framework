rotein and an effector molecule.
2. The RTK receptor may trigger multiple transduction pathways, directing a host of coordinated cellular responses.
In contrast, a typical GPCR triggers a single transduction pathway, ultimately activating a single final product that
leads to a specific cellular response.
Insulin signal transduction is an example of an RTK pathway. Insulin, a protein hormone produced in the
pancreas, is secreted into the blood in response to excess glucose in the blood. The hormone regulates the cellular
intake and utilization of glucose. Insulin, the signaling molecule, binds to the insulin receptor, an RTK of target
cells. Binding stimulates conformational changes that activate the receptor, which then trigger the formation of an
RTK dimer and autophosphorylation. Then, the complex binds to and phosphorylates an insulin response protein.
This response protein, now activated, initiates several signaling cascades. In muscle cells, one cascade leads to
glycogen synthesis
