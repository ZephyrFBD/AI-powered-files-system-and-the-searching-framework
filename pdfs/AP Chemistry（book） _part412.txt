3.7):
 
2 NaN31s2 ¡ 2 Na1s2 + 3 N21g2  
[3.8] 
The system is designed so that an impact ignites a detonator cap, which in turn causes 
NaN3 to decompose explosively. A small quantity of NaN3 (about 100 g) forms a large 
quantity of gas (about 50 L).
Give It Some Thought 
When Na and S undergo a combination reaction, what is the chemical formula of 
the product?
▲ Figure 3.7 Decomposition of sodium 
azide, NaN3(s), produces N2(g) that inflates 
air bags in automobiles.
 
Sample Exercise 3.3
Writing Balanced Equations for Combination and Decomposition Reactions
Write a balanced equation for (a) the combination reaction between lithium metal and fluorine gas and (b) the decomposition 
reaction that occurs when solid barium carbonate is heated (two products form, a solid and a gas).
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of the following reactions is the balanced equation  
that represents the decomposition reaction that occurs when  
silver(I) oxide is heated? 
(a) AgO1s2 ¡ Ag1s2 + O1g2 (b) 2 AgO1s
