ing the coding region of a gene and by regulatory proteins that bind to these
sequences.
B. Control over gene expression is important for determining when, and in which cells, a protein will be
made.
C. Gene regulation in bacteria involves control over the transcription of operons, and in eukaryotes involves
multiple levels before, during, and after transcription and translation.
D. Regulatory proteins provide both positive and negative control mechanisms for gene expression. They
inhibit gene expression by binding to DNA and blocking transcription (negative control), and they can
stimulate gene expression by binding to DNA and stimulating transcription (positive control) or binding
to repressors to inactivate their repressor functions.
E. Some genes, like ribosomal genes, are always turned “on” and are continuously expressed.
II.
Gene Regulation in Prokaryotes
A. In prokaryotes, such as bacteria, the single chromosome contains many genes that are organized into
operons.
1. An operon c
