 24.78  You are working in a biotechnology lab and are analyzing 
DNA. You obtain a sample of a short dodecamer of DNA 
that contains 12 base pairs. (a) What must the ratio of 
adenine to thymine be in your sample? (b) What must 
the ratio of cytosine to guanine be in your sample? 
 
(c) Assume the counterions present in your DNA solution 
are sodium ions. How many sodium ions must there be 
per dodecamer? Assume the 5′ end phosphates each bear 
a–1 charge.
 24.79  Imagine a single DNA strand containing a section with the 
following base sequence: 5′@
