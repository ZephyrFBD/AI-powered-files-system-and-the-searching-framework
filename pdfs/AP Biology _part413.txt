nd Trait 3 (because it does not have those
traits), and above Trait 4 and Trait 5 (because it does have those
traits). (EVO-3)
(D) Organism D has all the traits of the organisms on the same clade.
In this case, that is short tail and abdominal testes. The node below
D is loss of ear flaps—that is a new or “derived” trait—one that is
not shared with the previous organisms. Also, organism A has the
derived trait of retractable claws, which implies that all other
organisms have fixed claws. (EVO-3)
(D) One can read a cladogram from left to right or right to left. The
earthworm has none of the traits listed in the table, so it must be
placed in a clade separate from the other animals; either on extreme
left or extreme right. The three remaining animals all have the trait,
“backbone,” but only the salmon has no other trait listed in the table.
Thus, the salmon will be on its own clade after the trait “backbone.”
The lizard and cat both have legs, so their clades must emanate from
that trait
