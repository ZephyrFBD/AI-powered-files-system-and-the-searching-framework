Explain why trans fats have been banned from some restaurants. How are trans fats made, and what effect does a

Waxes
Wax covers the feathers of some aquatic birds and the leaf surfaces of some plants. Because of the hydrophobic nature of
waxes, they prevent water from sticking on the surface (Figure 3.19). Waxes are made up of long fatty acid chains esterified
