ed by the inactive repressor of the lac operon). This is accomplished by an
activator regulatory protein, CAP, that is activated by cyclic AMP (cAMP). When glucose levels are up, cAMP
levels are down, and the CAP activator is inactive. But when glucose is absent, cAMP levels are up, CAP is
activated and binds to the operator, promoting RNA polymerase transcription of the enzymes that break down
lactose. Because an activator protein is involved (CAP), this is an example of positive regulation.
In general, repressible operons are associated with genes that regulate anabolic biochemical pathways (pathways
that consume energy to synthesize new molecules). Inducible operons are associated with catabolic pathways
(pathways that release energy when they break down molecules). It should also be noted that these regulatory
processes are negative feedback mechanisms: They turn on remedial processes in response to changes in
environmental conditions (too much or too little tryptophan or lactose,
