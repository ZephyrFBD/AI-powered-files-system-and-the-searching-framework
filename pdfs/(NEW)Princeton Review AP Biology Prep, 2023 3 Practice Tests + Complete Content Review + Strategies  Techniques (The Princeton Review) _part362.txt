Viruses
Viruses are nonliving agents capable of infecting cells. Why are viruses considered nonliving? They require a host
cellâ€™s machinery in order to replicate. A virus consists of two main components: a protein shell (the capsid) and
genetic material made of DNA or RNA, depending on the virus. Viruses are all very specific in which type of cells
they infect, and the thing infected by a virus is called a host.
Viruses have one goal: replicate and spread. In order to do this, a virus needs to make more genome and make more
capsid. They then assemble together into new viral particles.
The viral genome carries genes for building the capsid and anything else the virus needs that the host cannot
provide. Sometimes, if two viruses infect the same cell, there will be mixing of the genomes, especially if the viruses
have genomes split between several chromosome-like segments. A new virus particle might emerge that is a blend
of the two viruses.
A commonly studied virus is a bacterio
