tside the system. When the molecules mix and 
become more randomly distributed, there is an increase in a thermodynamic quan-
tity called entropy. Entropy will be defined more rigorously in Chapter 19; but for 
now, we can consider that the entropy of a system increases if its degree of disor-
der increases, or if its energy becomes dispersed over a greater number of particles. 
Therefore, the mixing of gases we just described increases the entropy of the system. 
The enthalpy of the system, however, changes little upon gas mixing because there 
are few intermolecular interactions between the gas particles. All of the intermolec-
ular forces (dispersion forces, dipoleâ€“dipole interactions, hydrogen bonding) and 
their corresponding energies are part of the enthalpy of the system. Decreasing the 
enthalpy of the system would correspond to increasing favorable intermolecular 
interactions between gas particles. Furthermore, the balance between increasing the 
entropy and decreasing the en
