ly growth of its
population?
The population will follow an exponential growth curve as
there are no limitations on food and other resources in this
new location.
(A)
The population growth curve will rapidly level oﬀ and then
decline because this species does not belong in this area.
(B)
The population will remain at a steady level since the species
has become established but cannot become abundant in a
new location that diﬀers from its native habitat.
(C)
The population growth curve may initially appear to be
exponential, but will then level oﬀ over time to form a logistic
growth curve as resources become more limited.
(D)
2. A study examined the response of bird communities to Hurricane
Iris. Hurricanes can aﬀect communities in a variety of ways,
particularly by knocking down trees and causing structural
damage. The figure below shows the mean number of birds
captured for every 100 hours of eﬀort using a net. Values are given
for (1) captures over 58 days before Hurricane Iris (“pre-I
