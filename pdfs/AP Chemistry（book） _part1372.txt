 Some Thought
In addition to tetrahedral, another common shape for AB4 molecules is square 
planar. All five atoms lie in the same plane, with the B atoms at the corners of a 
square and the A atom at the center of the square. Which shape in Figure 9.3 could 
lead to a square-planar shape upon removal of one or more atoms?
9.2 ∣ The VSEpr Model
Imagine tying two identical balloons together at their ends. As shown in Figure 9.5, the 
two balloons naturally orient themselves to point away from each other; that is, they 
try to “get out of each other’s way” as much as possible. If we add a third balloon, the 
balloons orient themselves toward the vertices of an equilateral triangle, and if we add a 
fourth balloon, they adopt a tetrahedral shape. We see that an optimum geometry exists 
for each number of balloons.
In some ways, the electrons in molecules behave like these balloons. We have seen 
that a single covalent bond is formed between two atoms when a pair of electrons occu-
