Kinetic Energy Near Absolute Zero
Equation 13–8,
implies that as the temperature approaches absolute
zero, the kinetic energy of molecules approaches zero. Modern quantum theory,
however, tells us this is not quite so. Instead, as absolute zero is approached, the
kinetic energy approaches a very small nonzero minimum value. Even though all
real gases become liquid or solid near 0 K, molecular motion does not cease,
even at absolute ze
