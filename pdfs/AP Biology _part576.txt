landmarks is called piloting.

Behavior in animals is triggered by environmental stimuli and is vital to reproduction,
natural selection, and survival.
ANIMAL SIGNALS AND COMMUNICATION
Animals mark their territory with chemical signals called pheromones.
These chemicals can also act as alarm signals. For example, if a catfish is
injured, a substance is released from its skin that disperses in the water and
induces a fright response in other fish. The frightened fish become
hypervigilant and form into tightly packed schools for protection at the
lake or river bottom.
Visual signals are effective in open places in daylight. They provide
information about many factors including the sex, strength, and social
status of an individual. An example of symbolic communication is the
waggle dance in bees that gives details about the location of a food source.

An important theme in AP Biology is communication and signaling. Pheromones are a good
