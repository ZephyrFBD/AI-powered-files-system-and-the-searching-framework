er of the spacing
between atoms in the lattice, about 0.3 nm, what should
the speed of the neutrons be?
83. In Chapter 22, the intensity of light striking a surface was
related to the electric field of the associated electro-
magnetic wave. For photons, the intensity is the number of
photons striking a 
area per second.
Suppose
of 497-nm light are incident on a 
surface every second. What is the intensity of the light?
Using the wave model of light, what is the maximum
electric field of the electromagnetic wave?
84. The intensity of the Sun’s light in the vicinity of the Earth
is about 
Imagine a spacecraft with a mirrored
square sail of dimension 1.0 km. Estimate how much thrust
(in newtons) this craft will experience due to collisions with
the Sun’s photons. [Hint: Assume the photons bounce off the
sail with no change in the magnitude of their momentum.]
85. Light of wavelength 280 nm strikes a metal whose work
function is 2.2 eV. What is the shortest de Broglie wave-
length for the
