es. There are several different types
of angular movements, including flexion, extension, hyperextension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction. Flexion, or
bending, occurs when the angle between the bones decreases. Moving the forearm upward at the elbow or moving the wrist
to move the hand toward the forearm are examples of flexion. Extension is the opposite of flexion in that the angle between
the bones of a joint increases. Straightening a limb after flexion is an example of extension. Extension past the regular
anatomical position is referred to as hyperextension. This includes moving the neck back to look upward, or bending the
wrist so that the hand moves away from the forearm.
Abduction occurs when a bone moves away from the midline of the body. Examples of abduction are moving the arms or
legs laterally to lift them straight out to the side. Adduction is the movement of a bone toward the midline of the body.
Movement of the limbs inward after abduction is an example of adduc
