use such a case would require two diseased
copies of the X chromosome.

Essentially, transmission of hemophilia to a girl born with Turner syndrome would be very similar to the
conditions by which a boy would receive the disease. Both boys and girls with Turner syndrome have only one
copy of the X chromosome. Therefore, they both would have a 50 percent chance of receiving the diseased
copy of the X chromosome.

Choice (A) is true, but it doesn’t explain why the parents are normal. Choice (B) is a better explanation.
Carriers of recessive genetic diseases frequently do not have a recognizable phenotype because one normal
allele provides enough functioning protein to avoid the ill effects of the disease allele. Choice (C) is also
possible, but (B) is still the better answer. Finally, (D) is not correct because CLN3 is an autosomal gene.

Choice (C) describes a test cross that will actually let the breeder know if the male is heterozygous. If any
white-spotted pups result fro
