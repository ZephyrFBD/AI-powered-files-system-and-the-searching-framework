Crocodiles and birds share a recent common ancestor.
Amphibians and lungfish are more closely related than
amphibians and mammals.
Amphibians lay amniotic eggs.
On Andros Island in the Bahamas, populations of mosquitofish,
Gambusia hubbsi, colonized a series of ponds. These ponds are no
longer connected. However, the environments are very similar
except that some ponds contain predatory fish, while others do not.
In high predation ponds, selection has favored the evolution of a
body shape that enables rapid bursts of speed. In low predation
ponds, another body type is favoredâ€”one that is well-suited to swim
for long periods of time.
When scientists brought together sample mosquitofish from the
two types of ponds, they found that the females mated only with
males that had the same body type as their own. Which of the
following statements best describes what happened to the
mosquitofish as evidenced by the mating choice in the female fish?
Reproductive isolation caused geographic isolat
