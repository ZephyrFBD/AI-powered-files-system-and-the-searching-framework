 a cross between two true-breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics
inheritance pattern in which traits are distinct and are transmitted independently of one another
trait which confers the same physical appearance whether an individual has two copies of the trait or one copy
of the dominant trait and one copy of the recessive trait
inheritance pattern in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote; this allele
can only be transmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age
antagonistic interaction between genes such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of another
first filial generation in a cross; the offspring of the parental generation
second filial generation produced when F1 individuals are self-crossed or fertilized with each other
underlying genetic makeup, consisting of both physically visible and non-expressed alleles, of an organism
presence of only one allele for a characteristic, as in
