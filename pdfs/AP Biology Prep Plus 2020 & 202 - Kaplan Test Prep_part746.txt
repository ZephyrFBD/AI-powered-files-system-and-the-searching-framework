to the snakes and mosasaurs.

2. The figure below shows a phylogeny for amphipods, a type of
crustacean. There is information on two traits, temperature
tolerance and tube building. The hour values represent survival
times at increased temperature, with larger circles representing
greater temperature tolerance.

Based on this data, which of the following conclusions is most
likely to be accurate?
Tube building was a trait possessed by the common ancestor
of all of these groups but was secondarily lost in many
groups, including Isopoda.
