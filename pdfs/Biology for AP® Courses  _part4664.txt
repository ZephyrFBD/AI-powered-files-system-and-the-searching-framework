each one affects the other reciprocally. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere dissolves in water and combines
with water molecules to form carbonic acid, and then it ionizes to carbonate and bicarbonate ions (Figure 37.17)

Figure 37.17 Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form bicarbonate and carbonate ions.
The equilibrium coefficients are such that more than 90 percent of the carbon in the ocean is found as bicarbonate ions.
Some of these ions combine with seawater calcium to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a major component of marine
organism shells. These organisms eventually form sediments on the ocean floor. Over geologic time, the calcium carbonate
forms limestone, which comprises the largest carbon reservoir on Earth.
On land, carbon is stored in soil as a result of the decomposition of living organisms (by decomposers) or from weathering
of terrestrial rock and minerals. This carbon can be leached into the water reservoirs by surface runoff. Dee
