outlined
in Big Idea 2 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table. The Learning Objectives listed in
the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory
experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam questions. A Learning Objective merges required content with one or
more of the seven Science Practices.
Big Idea 2
Biological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,
and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.
Enduring
Understanding
2.C
Organisms use feedback mechanisms to regulate growth and reproduction, and to
maintain dynamic homeostasis.
Essential
Knowledge
2.C.1 Organisms use feedback mechanisms to maintain their internal environments and
respond to external environmental changes.
Science Practice 7.2 The student can connect concepts in and across domain(s) to generalize or
extrapolate in and/or across enduring understandings and/or big ideas.
