remaining at any time after the reaction has started, (2) the time interval required for a 
given fraction of a sample to react, or (3) the time interval required for a reactant concen-
tration to fall to a certain level.
The decomposition of a certain insecticide in water at 12 Â°C follows first-order kinetics with a rate constant of 1.45 yr-1. A 
quantity of this insecticide is washed into a lake on June 1, leading to a concentration of 5.0 * 10-7 g>cm3. Assume that 
the temperature of the lake is constant (so that there are no effects of temperature variation on the rate). (a) What is the 
concentration of the insecticide on June 1 of the following year? (b) How long will it take for the insecticide concentration to 
decrease to 3.0 * 10 - 7 g>cm3?
