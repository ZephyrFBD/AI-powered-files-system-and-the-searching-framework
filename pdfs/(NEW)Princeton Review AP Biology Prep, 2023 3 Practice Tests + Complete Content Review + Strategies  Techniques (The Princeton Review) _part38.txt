th?
(A) Stabilization of the substrate into the transition state during catalysis
(B) Transportation of catalyzed cargo from the nucleus to the mitochondria
(C) Creation of a homodimer through catalysis of homodimerization
(D) Attachment to the membrane by embedding into the phospholipid bilayer
39. Which of the following statements best predicts the effect on the proteinâ€™s structure if the subunits of the
homodimer fail to attach?
(A) The primary structure will change because the order of amino acids will differ.
(B) The secondary structure will differ because hydrogen bonds will occur in different locations and the protein
will fold into a different shape.
(C) The tertiary structure will be destroyed because the side chain interactions will not occur and the protein
will not fold into a 3-dimensional shape.
(D) The quaternary structure will be destroyed because the different amino acid chains will not join together.
40. According to Figure 1, within the protein ARKKKK60491, which of
