ng a gated ion
channel (refer to Figure 27.2). As a result, the hair cell membrane is depolarized, and a signal is transmitted to the chochlear
nerve. Intensity (volume) of sound is determined by how many hair cells at a particular location are stimulated.
The hair cells are arranged on the basilar membrane in an orderly way. The basilar membrane vibrates in different regions,
according to the frequency of the sound waves impinging on it. Likewise, the hair cells that lay above it are most sensitive
to a specific frequency of sound waves. Hair cells can respond to a small range of similar frequencies, but they require
stimulation of greater intensity to fire at frequencies outside of their optimal range. The difference in response frequency
between adjacent inner hair cells is about 0.2 percent. Compare that to adjacent piano strings, which are about six percent
different. Place theory, which is the model for how biologists think pitch detection works in the human ear, states that high
