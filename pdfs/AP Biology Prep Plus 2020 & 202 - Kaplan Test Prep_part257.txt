PHOTOTROPISM AND PHOTOPERIODISM
The ability to respond to external stimuli allows plants to adjust to their
environment and optimize growth, which is important for competition
and survival. Phototropism is the directional growth of plants in
response to a light stimulus. For example, if a plant on a window sill
detects light coming from the window, it can respond by growing toward
the light to obtain more li
