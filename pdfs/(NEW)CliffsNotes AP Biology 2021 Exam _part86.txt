luding the synthesis of lipids and steroid hormones, especially in cells that
produce these substances for export from the cell. In liver cells, smooth ER is involved in the breakdown of toxins,
drugs, and toxic by-products from cellular reactions.
4. A Golgi apparatus (Golgi body, Golgi complex) is a group of flattened sacs (cisternae) arranged like a stack of
bowls. They collect and modify proteins and lipids made in other areas of the cell and package them into vesicles,
small, spherically shaped sacs that bud from the outside surface of the Golgi apparatus. For example, a glycoprotein
made and packaged into a vesicle by the ER may be transported to the Golgi apparatus, where it is modified as it
passes through its chambers (Figure 3-3). At the outer side of the Golgi apparatus, the modified protein can be
packaged into a secretory vesicle, which migrates to and merges with the plasma membrane, releasing its contents to
the outside of the cell. Other packaged substances may be retai
