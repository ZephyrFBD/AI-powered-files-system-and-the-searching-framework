t to a second point (as in Eq. 6–7b
for gravity). Alternatively, we can define the change in potential energy as the
work required of an external force to move the object without acceleration between
the two points, as in Eq. 6–7a.
Potential Energy of Elastic Spring
We now consider potential energy associated with elastic materials, which includes
a great variety of practical applications. Consider the simple coil spring shown 
in Fig. 6–13. The spring has potential energy when compressed (or stretched),
because when it is released, it can do work on a ball as shown. To hold a spring either
stretched or compressed an amount x from its natural (unstretched) length requires
the hand to exert an external force on the spring of magnitude 
which is
directly proportional to x. That is,
where k is a constant, called the spring stiffness constant (or simply spring constant),
and is a measure of the stiffness of the particular spring. The stretched or compressed
spring itself exerts a force
