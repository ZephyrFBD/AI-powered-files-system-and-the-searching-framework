more dense than pure water, is (Tables 9–1 and 10–1)
Then, using Eq. 11–12, we find

NOTE We shall see later that waves can be used to “resolve” (or detect) objects
whose size is comparable to or larger than the wavelength. Thus, a dolphin 
can resolve objects on the order of a centimeter or larger in size.

Other Waves
Both transverse and longitudinal waves are produced when an earthquake occurs.
The transverse waves that travel through the body of the Earth are called S waves
(S for shear), and the longitudinal waves are called P waves (P for pressure) or
compression waves. Both longitudinal and transverse waves can travel through a
solid since the atoms or molecules can vibrate about their rela
