nly force acting on it is gravity. Thus, although the force of gravity acts on
objects within the satellite, the objects experience an apparent weightlessness
because they, and the satellite, are accelerating together as in free fall.
Figure 5–26 shows some examples of “free fall,” or apparent weightlessness,
experienced by people on Earth for brief moments.
A completely different situation occurs if a spacecraft is out in space far from
the Earth, the Moon, and other attracting bodies. The force of gravity due to the
Earth and other celestial bodies will then be quite small because of the distances
involved, and persons in such a spacecraft would experience real weightlessness.

He must feel very free because he is
