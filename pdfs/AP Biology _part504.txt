experiences cycles of exponential growth and crashes. Additionally,

cycles in the hare population are probably due to a limited food supply for
the hare due to a combination of malnutrition from cyclical overcrowding
and overgrazing and of predation by the lynx; see Figure 12.6.

COMMUNITY ECOLOGY
Communities are made of populations that interact with the environment
and with each other. They are characterized by how diverse and dense they
are. Species diversity has two components. One is species richness, the
number of different species in the community. The other is relative
abundance of the different species. In general, diverse communities are
more productive because they are more stable and survive for longer
periods of time. They are also better able to withstand and recover from
environmental stresses such as a dro
