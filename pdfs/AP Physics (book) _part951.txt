In most situations, such as in the design of structures and in working with the
human body, we are interested in maintaining stable equilibrium, or balance, as we
sometimes say. In general, an object whose center of gravity (CG) is below its point
of support, such as a ball on a string, will be in stable equilibrium. If the CG is above
the base of support, we have a more complicated situation. Consider a standing
refrigerator (Fig. 9–16a). If it is tipped slightly, it will return to its original 
position due to the torque on it as shown in Fig. 9–16b. But if it is tipped too far,
Fig. 9–16c, it will fall over. The critical point is reached when the CG shifts from
one side of the pivot point to the other. When the CG is on one side, the torque pulls
the object back onto its original base of support, Fig. 9–16b. If the object is t
