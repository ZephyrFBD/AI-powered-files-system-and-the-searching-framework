 brownish color when it binds to oxygen in a solution. One can
determine how much oxygen is in a sample simply by observing
how brown the solution is.

I would make a series of dilutions of guaiacol, plus different
amounts of oxygen, that range from clear (little oxygen present)
to dark brown (lots of oxygen present). I would then use a
spectrophotometer to quantify how dark the color of the dilution
is, which will help me then determine the amount of oxygen that
is present in each tube. Then, I would use the guaiacol dilutions
for comparison once I had results from the experiment.
The reaction that is the basis of this experiment is as follows:
Enzyme + Substrate→Product + Indicator→Brown colorEnzyme + Peroxid

of an enzymatic reaction, I would carry out this experiment
using the following different temperatures: 4°C, 15°C, 25°C,
38°C, 50°C, 70°C, and 100°C.
