Much of the information in this section is not within the scope for AP®. Immune systems can, at times, be defeated
by pathogens. For example, some bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, surround themselves with a capsule
that inhibits phagocytes from engulfing them and displaying antigens to the adaptive immune system. Human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS, infects helper T-cells via their CD4 surface molecules, gradually
depleting the number of TH cells in the body; this inhibits the adaptive immune system’s capacity to sufficiently respond to
infection or tumors that persons with healthy immune systems can defend against. Allergies to pollen or pet dander occur
when the immune system attacks the bod
