2. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Christmas tree
lights connected in parallel versus those connected in series.
3. If all you have is a 120-V line, would it be possible to light

4. Two lightbulbs of resistance 
and 
and a
battery are all connected in series. Which bulb is brighter?
What if they are connected in parallel? Explain.
5. Household outlets are often double outlets. Are these
connected in series or parallel? How do you know?
6. With two identical lightbulbs and two identical batteries,
explain how and why you would arrange the bulbs and bat-
teries in a circuit to get the maximum possible total power
to the lightbulbs. (Ignore internal resistance of batteries.)
7. If two identical resistors are connected in series to a battery,
does the battery have to supply more powe
