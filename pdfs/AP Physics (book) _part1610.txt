Work in isothermal and adiabatic
processes. In Fig. 15–3 we saw the PV diagrams for a gas expanding in two
ways, isothermally and adiabatically. The initial volume 
was the same in each
case, and the final volumes were the same
In which process was more
work done by the gas?
RESPONSE Our system is the gas. More work was done by the gas in the
isothermal process, which we can see in two simple ways by looking at Fig. 15–3.
First, the “average” pressure was higher during the isothermal process AB, so
was greater (
is the same for both processes). Second, we can
look at the area under each curve as we showed in Fig. 15–7b: the area under
curve AB, which represents the work done, is greater (because curve AB is higher)
than the area under AC in Fig. 15–3.
