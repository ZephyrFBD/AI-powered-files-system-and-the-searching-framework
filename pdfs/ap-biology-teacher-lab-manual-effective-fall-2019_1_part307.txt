aCl and have students break 
the sticks. The sticks in water have high turgor pressure and break with a “snap,” and 
those in saltwater are limp and difficult to break. Ask students to explain how the sound 
(snap) is produced. 
Materials 
• Elodea tips or Mnium hornum (moss) 
• Microscopes 
• Microscope slides and cover slips 
• Solutions from Procedure 2 
■ Preparation 
Elodea tips can be purchased from biological supply companies; however, some states 
have restricted its use because of Elodea’s invasive nature. Moss (Mniun hornum) can be 
obtained from a greenhouse or from the woods. Have students observe and draw the

cells at 400 X total magnification. The cell membrane shrinks away from the cell wall, 
and the central vacuole collapses when a high concentration of either sugar or salt is 
added; this process is called plasmolysis. 
Ask students how they would measure the water potential in the different
