e cell receives the signal, and a series of events within the cell allows it to proceed
into interphase. Moving forward from this initiation point, every parameter required during each cell cycle phase must be
met or the cycle cannot progress.
Regulation at Internal Checkpoints
It is essential that the daughter cells produced be exact duplicates of the parent cell. Mistakes in the duplication or
distribution of the chromosomes lead to mutations that may be passed forward to every new cell produced from an abnormal
cell. To prevent a compromised cell from continuing to divide, there are internal control mechanisms that operate at three
main cell cycle checkpoints. A checkpoint is one of several points in the eukaryotic cell cycle at which the progression of
a cell to the next stage in the cycle can be halted until conditions are favorable. These checkpoints occur near the end of G1,
at the G2/M transition, and during metaphase (Figure 10.11).
