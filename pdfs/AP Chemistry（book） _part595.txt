ic acid is Br-. Thus, the salt formed 
in the reaction is AlBr3. Writing the reactants and products and 
then balancing the equation gives the molecular equation:
 
2 Al1s2 + 6 HBr1aq2 ยก 2 AlBr31aq2 + 3 H21g2
Both HBr and AlBr3 are soluble strong electrolytes. Thus, the com-
plete ionic equation is
 
2 Al1s2 + 6 H+1aq2 + 6 Br-1aq2 ยก  
 
2 Al3+1aq2 + 6 Br-1aq2 + 3 H21g2
Because Br- is a spectator ion, the net ionic equation is
2 Al1s2 + 6 H+1aq2 ยก 2 Al3+1aq2 + 3 H21g2
Comment The substance oxidized is the aluminum metal because 
its oxidation state changes from 0 in the metal to +3 in the cat-
ion, thereby increasing in oxidation number. The H+ is reduced 
because its oxidation state changes from +1 in the acid to 0 in H2.
the Activity Series
Can we predict whether a certain metal will be oxidized either by an acid or by a partic-
ular salt? This question is of practical importance as well as chemical interest. According 
to Equation 4.26, for example, it would be unwise to store a solu
