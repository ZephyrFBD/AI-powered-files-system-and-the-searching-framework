their receptors are located in the cytoplasm of target cells. The amino acid-derived hormones are relatively
small molecules derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan; examples include epinephrine, norepinephrine,
thyroxin, and melatonin. Peptide hormones such as oxytocin and growth hormone consist of polypeptide chains of amino
acids. Because these hormones are water-soluble and insoluble in lipids, they cannot pass through the plasma membrane of
cells; their receptors are found on the surface of the target cells.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 and Big Idea 4
of the AP速 Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP速 exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices
