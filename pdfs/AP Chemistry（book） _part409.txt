CHAPTER 3 Chemical Reactions and Reaction Stoichiometry
3.2 ∣  
Simple Patterns  
of Chemical Reactivity
In this section we examine three types of reactions: combination reactions, decomposi-
tion reactions, and combustion reactions. Our first reason for examining these reactions 
is to become better acquainted with chemical reactions and their balanced equations. 
Our second reason is to consider how we might predict the products of some of these 
reactions knowing only their reactants. The key to predicting the products formed by 
a given combination of reactants is recognizing general patterns of chemical reactivity. 
Recognizing a pattern of reactivity for a class of substances gives you a broader under-
standing than merely memori
