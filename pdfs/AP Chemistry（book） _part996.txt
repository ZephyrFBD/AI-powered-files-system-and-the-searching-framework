tity is called a quantum of energy. The constant h is 
called the Planck constant: h = 6.626 * 10 - 34 J@s.
In the quantum theory, energy is quantized, meaning that it 
can have only certain allowed values. Einstein used the quantum the-
ory to explain the photoelectric effect, the emission of electrons from 
metal surfaces when exposed to light. He proposed that light behaves 
as if it consists of quantized energy packets called photons. Each pho-
ton carries energy, E = hn.
BOHR MODEL OF THE HYDROGEN ATOM (SECTION 6.3) Disper-
sion of radiation into its component wavelengths produces a spec-
trum. If the spectrum contains all wavelengths, it is called a continuous 
spectrum; if it contains only certain specific wavelengths, the spec-
trum is called a line spectrum. The radiation emitted by excited hydro-
gen atoms forms a line spectrum.
Bohr proposed a model of the hydrogen atom that explains its 
line spectrum. In this model, the energy of the electron in the hydro-
gen atom depends
