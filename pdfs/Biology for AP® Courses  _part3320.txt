vated by cAMP, can
catalyze many reactions. In this way, a small amount of hormone can trigger the formation of a large amount of cellular
product. To stop hormone activity, cAMP is deactivated by the cytoplasmic enzyme phosphodiesterase, or PDE. PDE
is always present in the cell and breaks down cAMP to control hormone activity, preventing overproduction of cellular
products.
The specific response of a cell to a lipid insoluble hormone depends on the type of receptors that are present on the
cell membrane and the substrate molecules present in the cell cytoplasm. Cellular responses to hormone binding of a
receptor include altering membrane permeability and metabolic pathways, stimulating synthesis of proteins and enzymes,
and activating hormone release.
