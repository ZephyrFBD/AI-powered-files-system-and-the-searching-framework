te is converted into molecules that eventually result in the synthesis of fatty acids
within the body. These fatty acids are stored in adipose cells—the fat cells in the mammalian body whose
primary role is to store fat for later use.
It is important to note that some animals benefit from obesity. Polar bears and seals need body fat for
insulation and to keep them from losing body heat during Arctic winters. When food is scarce, stored body
fat provides energy for maintaining homeostasis. Fats prevent famine in mammals, allowing them to access
energy when food is not available on a daily basis; fats are stored when a large kill is made or lots of food
is available.
