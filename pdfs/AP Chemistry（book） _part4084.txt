mately 1 out of 20 molecules has this kinetic energy.
14.55 (a)  
Ea = 7 kJ
∆E = –66 kJ
(b) Ea(reverse) = 73 kJ 14.57 (a) False (b) false (c) true 14.59 The 
order of slowest reaction to fastest reaction is:  rate (c) 6 rate (a)
6 rate (b).  14.61 (a) k = 1.1 s-1 (b) k = 13 s-1 (c) The method 
in parts (a) and (b) assumes that the collision model and thus 
the Arrhenius equation describe the kinetics of the reactions. 
That is, activation energy is constant over the temperature range 
under consideration. 14.63 A plot of ln k versus 1  >  T has a slope of 
-5.64 * 103; Ea = -R(slope) = 47.5 kJ>mol 14.65 (a) An elemen-
tary reaction is a process that occurs as a single event; the order is given 
by the coefficients in the balanced equation for the reaction. (b) A uni-
molecular elementary reaction involves only one reactant molecule; a 
bimolecular elementary reaction involves two reactant molecules. (c) 
A reaction mechanism is a series of elementary reactions that describes 
how an
