agnitude less. The break-even
point was very closely approached in the 1990s at the Tokamak Fusion Test
Reactor (TFTR) at Princeton, and the very high temperature needed for ignition
was exceeded—although not both of these at the same time.
Magnetic confinement fusion research continues throughout the world. This
research will help us in developing the huge multinational test device (European
Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia, China, and the U.S.), called ITER
(International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor). It is hoped that ITER will
be finished and running by 2020, in France, with an expected power output of
about 500 MW, 10 times the input energy. ITER is planned to be the final research
step before building a working reactor.
The second method for containing the fuel for fusion is inertial confinement
fusion (ICF): a small pellet or capsule of deuterium and tritium (Fig. 31–15b) is
struck simultaneously from hundreds of directions by very intense laser beams. The
intense
