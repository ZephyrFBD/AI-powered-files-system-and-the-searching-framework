l x-y values
on the graph and population numbers
corresponding to the starting populations could
differ.
c.
The overall S-shape would be the same for all
populations showing logistic growth. The only
factor that could differ is the actual x-y values on
the graphs indicating the time frames for the
growth curves.
d.
The x-y values on the graphs indicating the time
frames for the growth curves would be the same.
Overall S shape and population numbers
corresponding to the starting populations could
differ.
65. Explain why the concept of carrying capacity is
important when discussing human population growth.

a.
Humans can decrease the carrying capacity of
their environment by developing food
production methods and engineering high
quality shelters, which enables more people to
live than would otherwise be possible.
b.
Humans have been able to change the carryin
