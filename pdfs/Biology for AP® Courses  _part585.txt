Big Idea 2
Biological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,
and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.
Enduring
Understanding
2.B
Growth, reproduction and dynamic homeostasis require that cells create and maintain
internal environments that are different from their external environments.
Essential
Knowledge
2.B.2 Growth and dynamic homeostasis are maintained by the constant movement of
molecules across membranes.

1.4 The student can use representations and models to analyze situations or solve problems
qualitatively and quantitatively.
Learning
Objective
2.12 The student is able to use representations and models to analyze situations or solve
problems qualitatively and quantitatively to investigate whether dynamic homeostasis is
maintained by the active movement of molecules across membranes.
