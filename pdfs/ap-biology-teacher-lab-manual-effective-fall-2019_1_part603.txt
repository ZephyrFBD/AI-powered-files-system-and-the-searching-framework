that bacteria use these enzymes 
during DNA repair and as a defense against their infection by bacteriophages. Molecular 
biologists use restriction enzymes to manipulate and analyze DNA sequences (Johnson 
2009). 
How do restriction enzymes work? These enzymes digest DNA by cutting the 
molecule at specific locations called restriction sites. Many restriction enzymes 
recognize a 4- to 10-nucleotide base pair (bp) palindrome, a sequence of DNA 
nucleotides that reads the same from either direction. Some restriction enzymes cut (or 
“cleave”) DNA strands exactly in the center of the restriction site (or “cleavage site”), 
creating blunt ends, whereas others cut the backbone in two places, so that the pieces 
have single-stranded overhanging or “sticky” ends of unpaired nucleotides. 
You have a piece of DNA with the following template strand:
