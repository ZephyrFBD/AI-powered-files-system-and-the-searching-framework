Putting Concepts Together
(b) The actual values of colligative properties of electrolytes 
are less than those calculated because the electrostatic 
interactions between ions limit their independent move-
ments. In this case, the van’t Hoff factor, which measures 
the extent to which electrolytes actually dissociate into 
ions, is given by:
Thus, the solution behaves as if the CaCl2 has dissociated 
into 2.62 particles instead of the ideal 3.
(c) If the solution is 0.0397 M in CaCl2 and has a total volume 
of 0.100 L, the number of moles of solute is: 
10.00397 mol21-81.3 kJ>mol2 = -0.323 kJ 
 
The heat absorbed by the solution is 
q = +0.323 kJ = 323 J. The mass of the 0.100 L of solu-
tion is 1100 mL211.00 g>mL2 = 100 g (to three signiﬁcant 
ﬁgures). Thus, the temperature change is:
