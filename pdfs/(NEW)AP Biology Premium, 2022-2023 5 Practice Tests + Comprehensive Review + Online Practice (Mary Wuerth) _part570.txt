rass population.
(d) Since Arctic foxes prey on puffins, the elimination of the Arctic foxes would increase the number of
puffins. Since puffins consume the Arctic grass, this increase in puffins would decrease the density of the
Arctic grass on the island.

13. (a) The dace fish are secondary consumers because they eat daphnia, which are primary consumers (that eat
algae, which are the producers). Dace fish are also the prey of the largemouth bass.
(b) The independent variable is the introduction of the great blue herons. The dependent variable is the relative
population sizes of the largemouth bass and the dace fish.
(c) The introduction of the great blue herons reduced the relative population size of the largemouth bass by
about 40% and increased the relative population size of the dace fish by about 40%. This is because the
great blue herons fed on the largemouth bass, reducing their numbers. As a result of this decrease in
largemouth bass, the number of dace fish
