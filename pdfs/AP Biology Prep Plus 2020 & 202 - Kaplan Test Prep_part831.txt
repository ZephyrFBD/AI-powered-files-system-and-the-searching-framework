vity, the ozone layer will be depleted beyond recovery,
preventing certain forms of life from surviving on Earth.
The other major global impact of human activity is the release of
greenhouse gases (water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous
oxide) into the atmosphere from the ineﬀicient burning of fossil fuels
(there are sources from manmade aerosols as well). As these gases
become denser in the Earth’s atmosphere, they prevent heat from
escaping the Earth’s surface, causing global warming. Scientists believe
that the Earth’s atmospheric temperature is steadily rising and that this
will cause major shiȇs in seawater levels, local climates, and world
weather patterns.
Habitat destruction occurs as people clear natural areas for natural
resources, housing, and recreational areas. This has resulted in the
extinction of many species of plants and animals and has an adverse
impact on our worldwide water resources, global temperatures, and food
availability.
