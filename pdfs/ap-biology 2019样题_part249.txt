sibility. During labs, 
students are encouraged to proceed independently, 
receiving only minor guidance from the teacher by 
the end of the course. Students should have many 
opportunities for post-lab reporting to share the 
successes and challenges of individual lab designs. 
Observations and Data 
Manipulation
Students must practice making careful observations 
and accurately recording what they observe. Too 
frequently students confuse what they see with what 
they think they are supposed to see. They should 
be encouraged to be accurate reporters, even when 
their findings seem to conflict with what they are led 
to expect by the textbook or lab procedure. Proper 
interpretation of observations is also important. 
Students should be able to find evidence of change 
(growth, color change, temperature change, gas 
evolution, etc.) and its absence. Students should know 
how to make and interpret quantitative measurements 
correctly. This includes knowing the appropriate 
instrument
