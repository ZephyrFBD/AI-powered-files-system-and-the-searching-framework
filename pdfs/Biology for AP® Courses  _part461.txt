 vesicles still need to be sorted,
packaged, and tagged so that they wind up in the right place. Sorting, tagging, packaging, and distribution of lipids and
proteins takes place in the Golgi apparatus (also called the Golgi body), a series of flattened membranes (Figure 4.20).

Figure 4.20 The Golgi apparatus in this white blood cell is visible as a stack of semicircular, flattened rings in the lower
portion of the image. Several vesicles can be seen near the Golgi apparatus. (credit: modification of work by Louisa

The receiving side of the Golgi apparatus is called the cis face. The opposite side is called the trans face. The transport
vesicles that formed from the ER travel to the cis face, fuse with it, and empty their contents into the lumen of the Golgi
apparatus. As the proteins and lipids travel through the Golgi, they undergo further modifications that allow the
