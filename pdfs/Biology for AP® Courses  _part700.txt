reactions come from? The answer lies with an energy-
supplying molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. ATP is a small, relatively simple molecule (Figure 6.13), but
within some of its bonds, it contains the potential for a quick burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work.
This molecule can be thought of as the primary energy currency of cells in much the same way that money is the currency
that people exchange for things they need. ATP is used to power the majority of energy-requiring cellular reactions.

Figure 6.13 ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell. It has an adenosine backbone with three phosphate groups
attached.
As its name suggests, adenosine triphosphate is comprised of adenosine bound to three phosphate groups (Figure 6.13).
Adenosine is a nucleoside consisting of the nitrogenous base adenine and a five-carbon sugar, ribose. The thre
