ound healing. Light receptors are common in plants
and help link environmental cues to biological processes such as seed germination, the timing of flowering, and
chlorophyll production. Some plants can also use chemicals to communicate with nearby plants. For example,
wounded tomatoes produce a volatile chemical as an alarm signal. This warns nearby plants and allows them to
prepare a defense or immune response.
CELL DIVISION
Every second, thousands of cells are dying throughout our bodies. Fortunately, the body replaces them at an
amazing rate. In fact, epidermal cells, or skin cells, die off and are replaced so quickly that the average 18-year-old
grows an entirely new skin every few weeks. The body keeps up this unbelievable rate thanks to the mechanisms of
cell division.
The remainder of this chapter takes a closer look at how cells divide. But remember, cell division is only a small part
of the life cycle of a cell. Most of the time, cells are busy carrying out their regular acti
