 on the equator or
metaphase plate.
Centrosomes are already positioned at opposite poles of the cell.
Spindle fibers run from the centrosomes to the kinetochores in the
centromeres.
Anaphase
Centromeres of each chromosome separate, as spindle fibers pull
apart the sister chromosomes that will move toward the poles.
Telophase
Chromosomes cluster at opposite ends of the cell, and the nuclear
membrane reforms.

The supercoiled chromosomes begin to unravel and to return to
their normal, pre-cell division condition as long, threadlike strands.
Once two individual nucleoli form, mitosis is complete.

CYTOKINESIS
Cytokinesis consists of the dividing of the cytoplasm. It begins during
mitosis, often during anaphase. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms
down the middle of the cell as actin and myosin microfilaments pinch in
the
