Sample Exercise 24.2 
Writing Condensed Structural Formulas
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the systematic name for a hydrocarbon and 
asked to write its condensed structural formula.
Plan Because the name ends in -ane, the compound is an alkane, 
meaning that all the carbon–carbon bonds are single bonds.  
The parent hydrocarbon is pentane, indicating five C atoms  
Cycloalkanes
Alkanes that form rings, or cycles, are called cycloalkanes. As Figure 24.5 illustrates, 
cycloalkane structures are sometimes drawn as line structures, which are polygons in 
which each corner represents a CH2 group. This method of representation is similar to 
that used for benzene rings. 
 (Section 8.6) (Remember from our benzene discussion 
that in aromatic structures each vertex re
