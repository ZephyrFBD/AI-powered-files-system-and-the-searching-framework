ors often require responses to visual and chemical stimuli.
Flower color and flower scent are signals that animals use to locate flowers (and that plants use to attract them). In
many cases, the vision and olfactory abilities of animals have coevolved with flower color and scents. Bees, for
example, are attracted to yellow or blue flowers, with sweet, fragrant scents. Birds are attracted to red and yellow
flowers (but have a poor sense of smell). Flowers provide animals a source of protein (from pollen) and
carbohydrates (from sugars in nectar). Plants, in exchange, use animals to disperse pollen.
Fruit color is a signal that can help animals locate fruit and to differentiate edible ripe fruit from fruit that is
unpalatable or even toxic. Red coloring, for example, distinguishes edible from toxic tomatoes. In other cases, fruit
color is a warning that the fruit is poisonous. Chemical signals from aromatic compounds released from fruit may
also provide cues as to whether the fruit is ed
