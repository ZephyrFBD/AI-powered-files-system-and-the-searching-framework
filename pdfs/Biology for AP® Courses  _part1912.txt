e individual patientâ€™s genotype. The gene signatures may not be completely
accurate, but can be tested further before pathologic symptoms arise.
Microbial Genomics: Metagenomics
Traditionally, microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture
conditions, which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory. Because microorganisms can go
through several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment
very quickly. In addition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist being cultured in isolation. Most microorganisms do
not live as isolated entities, but in microbial communities known as biofilms. For all of these reasons, pure culture is not
always the best way to study microorganisms. Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species
that grow and interact in an environmental niche. Metagenomics can be used to identify new spec
