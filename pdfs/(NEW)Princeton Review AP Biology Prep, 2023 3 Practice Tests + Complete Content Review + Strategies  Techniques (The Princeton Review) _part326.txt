enes are described as the genotype of the organism. The physical expression of the traits, or what you see in
the organism, is the phenotype.
Homozygous individuals have only one allele that will determine the phenotype. However, heterozygous
individuals have two different alleles that could contribute to the phenotype. The allele that “wins out” and
directs the phenotype is the dominant allele. The one that doesn’t show up in the phenotype is the recessive
allele.
Simple genetics with dominants and recessives was illuminated by Gregor Mendel. In Mendelian genetics, there
are three important laws: the Law of Dominance, the Law of Segregation, and the Law of Independent
Assortment.
If two genes are on the same chromosome and close together, they are linked. Completely linked alleles on the
same chromosome are locked together and travel together during gamete formation. Recombination frequency
can be used to measure how far apart two genes are on a chromosome.
Humans have 23 pairs of hom
