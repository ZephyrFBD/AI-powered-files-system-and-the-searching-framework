▶Practice Exercise 2
The standard cell potential is 1.46 V for a voltaic cell based on 
the following half-reactions:
In+1aq2 ¡ In3+1aq2 + 2 e-
Br21l2 + 2 e- ¡ 2 Br-1aq2
Using Table 20.1, calculate E°
red for the reduction of In3+ to In+.
Use Table 20.1 to calculate E °
cell for the voltaic cell described in Sample Exercise 20.4, which is based on the reaction
Cr2O7
2-1aq2 + 14 H+1aq2 + 6 I-1aq2 ¡ 2 Cr3+1aq2 + 3 I21s2 + 7 H2O1l2
Solve
The half-reactions are:
Analyze We are given the equation for a redox reaction and asked 
to use data in Table 20.1 to calculate the standard cell potential for 
the associated voltaic cell.
Plan Our first step is to identify the half-reactions that occur at the 
cathode and anode, which we did in Sample Exercise 20.4. Then 
we use Table 20.1 and Equation 20.8 to calculate the standard cell 
potential.
Check The cell potential, 0.79 V, is a positive number. As noted ear-
lier, a voltaic cell must have a positive potential.
