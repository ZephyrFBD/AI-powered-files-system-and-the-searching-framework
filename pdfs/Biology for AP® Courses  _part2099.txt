72. In addition to biology, evidence drawn from many
different disciplines, including chemistry, geology, and
mathematics, supports models of the origin of life on
Earth. In order to determine when the first forms of life
likely formed, the rate of radioactive decay can be used to
determine the age of the oldest rocks (see optional
problems C and D, below) exposed on Earthâ€™s surface.
These are found to be approximately 3.5 billion years old.
The age of rocks can be correlated to fossils of the earliest
forms of life.
A. The graph compares times of divergence from the last
common ancestor based on the fossil record with a
"molecular time" constructed by comparing sequences of
conserved proteins to determine a mutation rate (after
