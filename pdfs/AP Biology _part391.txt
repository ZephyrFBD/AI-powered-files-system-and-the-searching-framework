lation). If this were not so, females
would have double the amount of X chromosome gene products than
males. The inactivated X chromosomes can be seen under a
microscope as a condensed spot near the nuclear membrane called a
Barr body. In any one cell, the X chromosome that is condensed is

body, half of them will have one active X chromosome and the other
half will have an inactive X chromosome. (IST-2)
