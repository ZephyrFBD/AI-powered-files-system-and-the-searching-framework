at lives from one year to the next; instead, many plants are annuals that grow quickly and
reproduce when rainfall does occur, then they die. Many other plants in these areas are characterized by having a number of
adaptations that conserve water, such as deep roots, reduced foliage, and water-storing stems (Figure 35.15). Seed plants in
the desert produce seeds that can be in dormancy for extended periods between rains. Adaptations in desert animals include
nocturnal behavior and burrowing.

Figure 35.15 To reduce water loss, many desert plants have tiny leaves or no leaves at all. The leaves of ocotillo
(Fouquieria splendens), shown here in the Sonora Desert near Gila Bend, Arizona, appear only after rainfall, and then
are shed.
Chaparral
The chaparral is also called the scrub forest and is found in California, along the Mediterranean Sea, and along the southern
coast of Australia (Figure 35.12). The annual rainfall in this biome ranges from
