e).
ii. Organisms use free energy to help regulate body temperature and metabolism. Mechanisms
through which this regulation takes place include:
Endothermy—use of internal thermal energy that is generated by metabolism to maintain an
organism’s body temperature.
Ectothermy—use of external thermal energy to assist in the regulation of an organism’s body
temperature.
Some plant species utilize elevated floral temperatures.
iii. There is an important relationship between the metabolic rate/unit body mass and the size of
multicellular organisms. In other words, smaller organisms generally have higher metabolic rates.
C. Energy Coupling
1. Coupled reactions—a chemical reaction having a common intermediate in which energy is transferred
from one reaction to another.
2. A system can maintain order by utilizing coupling cellular processes that increase entropy (causing
negative changes in free energy) with those that decrease entropy (causing positive changes in free
energy).
3. The molecule
