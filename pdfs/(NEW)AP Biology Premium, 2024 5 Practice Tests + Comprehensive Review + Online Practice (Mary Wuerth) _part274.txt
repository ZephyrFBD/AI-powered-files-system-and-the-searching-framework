es from
diploid (2n) parent cells. This helps maintain the proper number of chromosomes in the offspring. When a haploid
(n) egg is fertilized by a haploid (n) sperm, the resulting zygote has the correct diploid (2n) number of
chromosomes.
Unlike mitosis, which results in the creation of two genetically identical diploid daughter cells, meiosis has two
rounds of cell division (meiosis I and meiosis II) that result in the creation of four genetically different haploid
gametes.
When determining the number of chromosomes in a cell, count the number of centromeresâ€”this will tell you the number of chromosomes. Be aware
that before DNA replication, a chromosome will have one chromatid, and after DNA replication, a chromosome will have two chromatids.
Meiosis I
The first round of cell division in meiosis is called meiosis I, and it is sometimes referred to as a reduction division.
Meiosis I consists of four stages: prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I.
In the prophase stage of
