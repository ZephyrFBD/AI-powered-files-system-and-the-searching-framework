nent chemical change itself. (b) A 
homogeneous catalyst is in the same phase as the reactants, while a 
hetereogeneous catalyst is in a different phase. (c) A catalyst has no 
effect on the overall enthalpy change for a reaction, but it does affect 
activation energy. It can also affect the frequency factor.

14.79 (a) Multiply the coefficients in the ﬁrst reaction by 2 and 
sum. (b) NO2(g) is a catalyst. (c) NO(g) is an intermediate. (d) This 
is a homogeneous catalysis. 14.81 (a) Use of chemically stable sup-
ports makes it possible to obtain very large surface areas per unit mass 
of the precious metal catalyst because the metal can be deposited in 
a very thin, even monomolecular, layer on the surface of the sup-
port. (b) The greater the surface area of the catalyst, the more reac-
tion sites, the greater the rate of the catalyzed reaction. 14.83 To 
put two D atoms on a single carbon, it is necessary that one of the 
already existing C—H bonds in ethylene be bro
