6. Suppose you viewed the light transmitted through a thin
coating layered on a flat piece of glass. Draw a diagram,
similar to Fig. 24–30 or 24–36, and describe the conditions
required for maxima and minima. Consider all possible
values of index of refraction. Discuss the relative intensity of
the minima compared to the maxima and to zero.
7. What percent of visible light is reflected from plain glass?
Assume your answer refers to transmission through each
surface, front and back. How does the presence of multiple
lenses in a good camera degrade the image? What is 
suggested in Section 24–8 to reduce this reflection?
Explain in words, and sketch how this solution works.
For a glass lens in air, about how much improvement does
this solution provide?
