protein, was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase (1952) carried out experiments that lent strong
support to the theory that DNA is the genetic material. They tagged
bacteriophages with the radioactive isotopes 32P and 35S. Since proteins
contain sulfur but not phosphorus and DNA contains phosphorus but not
sulfur, the radioactive 32P labeled the DNA of the phage viruses, while 35S
labeled the protein coat of the phage viruses. Hershey and Chase found
that when bacteria were infected with phage viruses, the radioactive
phosphorus in the phage always entered the bacterium, while the
radioactive sulfur remained outside the cells. This proved that DNA from
the viral nucleus, not protein from the viral coat, was infecting bacteria
and producing thousands of progeny.
