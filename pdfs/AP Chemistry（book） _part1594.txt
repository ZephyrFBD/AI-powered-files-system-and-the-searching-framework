SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the temperature 131 Â°C2 and pressure (735 torr) 
for a gas, together with information to determine its volume and 
mass, and we are asked to calculate its molar mass.
Plan The data obtained when the flask is filled with water can be 
used to calculate the volume of the container. The mass of the 
empty flask and of the flask when filled with gas can be used to 
calculate the mass of the gas. From these quantities we calculate 
the gas density and then apply Equation 10.11 to calculate the mo-
lar mass of the gas.
Solve The gas volume equals the volume of water the flask can 
hold, calculated from the mass and density of the water. The mass 
of the water is the difference between the masses of the full and 
evacuated flask:
1067.9 g - 134.567 g = 933.3 g
Rearranging the equation for density 1d = m>V2, we have
V = m
d =
1933.3 g2
10.997 g>mL2 = 936 mL = 0.936 L
The gas mass is the difference between the mass of the
