an over-simplified
example, a cell destined to become a muscle might have an increase in things that make it flexible, while something
destined to become bone might have a decrease in those things. Once the change has been made, the future muscle
cell can’t change its mind and become a bone cell. In other words, cells don’t typically go backwards, or
dedifferentiate.
The early genes that turn certain cells in the early embryo into future-this or future-that are called homeotic genes.
A subset of homeotic genes are called Hox genes. Timing is essential for the induction (activation) of these genes.
Exactly the right bit of the embryo must be modified at exactly the right time. Otherwise, the embryo may develop
with the brain in the wrong place, with too many limbs, or with limbs on only one side of the body. Severely
damaged embryos will typically stop developing and die.
An interesting additional tool that the developing embryo uses is apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Certain bits
