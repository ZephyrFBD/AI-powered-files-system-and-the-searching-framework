Notice that the arrangement of atoms is the same in each structure—only the placement 
of electrons differs. In writing resonance structures, the same atoms must be bonded to 
each other in all structures, so that the only differences are in the arrangements of elec-
trons. All three NO -
3  Lewis structures are equally dominant and taken together adequately 
describe the ion, in which all three N¬O bond lengths are the same.
Give It Some Thought
Predict whether the N—O bonds in NO -
3  are stronger or weaker than the N—O 
bond in NO+.
For some molecules or ions, all possible Lewis structures may not be equivalent; in 
other words, one or more resonance structures are more dominant than others. We will 
encounter examples of this as we proceed.
Resonance in Benzene
Resonance is an important concept in describing the bonding in organic molecules, par-
ticularly aromatic organic molecules, a category that includes the hydroc
