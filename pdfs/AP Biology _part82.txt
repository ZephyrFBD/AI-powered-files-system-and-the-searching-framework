es oriented at right
angles to each other make up one centrosome and consist of 9 triplets of
microtubules (just like spindle fibers) arranged in a circle. Plant cells lack
centrosomes, but have MTOCs. In animal cells, the MTOC is synonymous
with centrosome.

Cell Wall
The cell wall is one cell structure that is not found in animal cells. Plants
and algae have cell walls made of cellulose. The cell walls of fungi are
usually made of chitin. Those of prokaryotes consist of other
polysaccharides and complex polymers. The primary cell wall is
immediately outside the plasma membrane. Some cells produce a second
cell wall underneath the primary cell wall, called the secondary cell wall.
When a plant cell divides, a thin gluey layer is formed between the two
new cells, which becomes the middle lamella.
Plasma Membrane
The cell or plasma membrane is a selectively permeable membrane that
regulates the steady traffic that enters and leaves the cell. S. J. Singer is
