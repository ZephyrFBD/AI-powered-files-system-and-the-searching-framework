Kirchhoff’s Rules
533
Kirchhoff’s first rule or junction rule is based on the conservation of electric
charge (we already used it to derive the equation for parallel resistors). It states that
at any junction point, the sum of all currents entering the junction must
equal the sum of all currents leaving the junction.
That is, whatever charge goes in must come out. For example, at the junction
point a in Fig. 19–11,
is entering whereas 
and 
are leaving. Thus Kirchhoff’s
junction rule states that 
We already saw an instance of this in the
NOTE at the end of Example 19–5.
Kirchhoff’s second rule or loop rule is based on the conservation of energy.
It states that
the sum of the changes in potential around any closed loop of a circuit must
be zero.
To see why this rule should hold, consider a rough analogy with the potential energy
of a roller coaster on its track. When the roller coaster starts from the station, it
has a particular potentia
