temperature reaches about 
even helium nuclei, in spite of their greater
charge and hence greater electrical repulsion, can come close enough to each
other to undergo fusion. The reactions are

This fusion of helium causes a change in the star which moves rapidly to the
“horizontal branch” on the H–R diagram (Fig. 33–8). Further fusion reactions
are possible, with

In more massive stars, higher Z

from lighter ones (or by absorption of neutrons which tends to occur at higher Z)
is called nucleosynthesis.
Low Mass Stars—White Dwarfs
The final fate of a star depends on its mass. Stars can lose mass as parts of their
outer envelope move off into space. Stars born with a mass less than about

the mass of our Sun) eventuall
