ve charge equals the 
total negative charge. Thus, there is one Na +  to one Cl- in NaCl, one Ba2+ to two Cl- in 
BaCl2, and so forth.
As you consider these and other examples, you will see that if the charges on the 
cation and anion are equal, the subscript on each ion is 1. If the charges are not equal, 
the charge on one ion (without its sign) will become the subscript on the other ion. For

Identifying Ionic and Molecular Compounds
Which of these compounds would you expect to be ionic: N2O, Na2O, CaCl2, SF4?
 
â–¶Practice Exercise 2
Give a reason why each of the following statements is a safe 
prediction:
(a) Every compound of Rb with a nonmetal is ionic in character.
(b)  
Every compound of nitrogen with a halogen element is a 
molecular compound.
(c)  
The compound MgKr2 does not exist.
(d)  
Na and K are very similar in the compounds they form with 
nonmetals.
(e)  
If contained in an ionic compound, calcium (Ca) will be in 
the form of the doubly charged io
