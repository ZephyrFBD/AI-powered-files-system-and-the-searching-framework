this
setup.
Table 19.2
Figure 19.20 is an illustration of the Petri dishes that shows the results
of this experiment.
Plate 1. These bacteria were incubated with plasmid. There are 7
colonies growing here. Each colony consists of bacteria that have
been transformed and are resistant to the antibiotic because they
absorbed the plasmid.
Plate 2. This plate contains a lawn of bacteria. Any bacteria would
grow on this plate; there is no antibiotic to prevent it. However, this
culture did receive plasmid. We can assume that this plate contains
bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotic as well as those that are
susceptible to it.
Plate 3. There is no growth on this dish. These bacteria were not
incubated with plasmid and the plate contains no growth because
the dish contains antibiotic that killed the bacteria.
Plate 4. The bacteria were not incubated with plasmid and the plate
also contains a lawn of growth because there is no antibiotic to kill
the bacteria.
