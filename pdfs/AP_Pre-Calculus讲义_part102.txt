3.12.2 Rates of Change in Polar Functions 
• 
If a polar function, r = f (), is positive and increasing or negative and 
decreasing, then the distance between f () and the origin is increasing. 
• 
If a polar function, r = f (), is positive and decreasing or negative and 
increasing, then the distance between f () and the origin is decreasing. 
• 
The average rate of change of r with respect to  over an interval of  is the ratio of 
the change in the radius values to the change in  over an interval
