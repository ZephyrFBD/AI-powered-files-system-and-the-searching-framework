wood, or coal) in air, which is a chemical reaction, occurring at the atomic level (and at a much lower
temperature).

H–R diagram, as shown in Fig. 33–8. As it moves upward, it enters the red giant
stage. Thus, theory explains the origin of red giants as a natural step in a star’s
evolution. Our Sun, for example, has been on the main sequence for about 
billion years. It will probably remain there another 5 or 6 billion years. When
our Sun leaves the main sequence, it is expected to grow in diameter (as it
becomes a red giant) by a factor of 100 or more, possibly swallowing up inner
planets such as Mercury and possibly Venus and even Earth.
If the star is like our Sun, or larger, further fusion can occur. As the star’s
outer envelope expands, its core continues to shrink a
