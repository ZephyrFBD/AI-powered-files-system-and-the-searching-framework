STANDING
ENE-2
Cells have membranes that allow them to establish and maintain internal 
environments that are different from their external environments.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-2.E
Describe the mechanisms 
that organisms use to 
maintain solute and 
waterÂ balance.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-2.E.1
Passive transport is the net movement of 
molecules from high concentration to low 
concentration without the direct input of 
metabolic energy.
ENE-2.E.2
Passive transport plays a primary role in the 
import of materials and the export of wastes.
ENE-2.E.3
Active transport requires the direct input of 
energy to move molecules from regions of low 
concentration to regions of high concentration.
ENE-2.F
Describe the mechanisms 
that organisms use to 
transport large molecules 
across the plasma 
membrane.
ENE-2.F.1
The selective permeability of membranes 
allows for the formation of concentration 
gradients of solutes across the membrane.
ENE-2.F.2
The processes of endocytosis and exocytosis
