e an expression 
for the difference in energy between State C and State D. 
 
(d) Suppose there is another state of the system, State E, 
and its energy relative to State A is ∆E = ∆E1 + ∆E4. Where 
would State E be on the diagram? [Section 5.2]

5.7 You may have noticed that when you compress the air in 
a bicycle pump, the body of the pump gets warmer. (a) 
Assuming the pump and the air in it comprise the system, 
what is the sign of w when you compress the air? (b) What 
is the sign of q for this process? (c) Based on your answers to 
parts (a) and (b), can you determine the sign of ∆E for com-
pressing the air in the pump? If not, what would you expect 
for the sign of ∆E? What is your reasoning? [Section 5.2]
 
5.8 Imagine a container placed in a tub of water, as depicted in 
the accompanying diagram. (a) If the contents of the con-
tainer are the system and heat is able to flow through the 
container walls, what
