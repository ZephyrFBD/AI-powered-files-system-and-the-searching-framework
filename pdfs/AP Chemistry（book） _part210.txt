arranged. A property is any characteristic that gives a sample of matter 
its unique identity. A molecule is an entity composed of two or more 
atoms, with the atoms attached to one another in a specific way.
The scientific method is a dynamic process used to answer ques-
tions about the physical world. Observations and experiments lead

refined, a theory may be developed that can predict the results of fu-
ture observations and experiments. When observations repeatedly 
lead to the same consistent results, we speak of a scientific law, a gen-
