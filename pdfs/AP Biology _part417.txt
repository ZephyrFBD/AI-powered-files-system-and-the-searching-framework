The oceans have risen and lowered repeatedly. Volcanic activity
has drastically changed Earth and killed off untold numbers of species.
Meteorites bombarding Earth from outer space were responsible for the
dinosaurs going extinct and giving mammals a chance to expand around
the globe. Five major extinctions have occurred. Additionally, 4 billion
years ago, the atmosphere contained no free oxygen. However,
cyanobacteria, oxygen-generating organisms that form rocklike structures
called stromatolites, provided free oxygen for the oceans and atmosphere.
At first, this high oxygen level killed off most anaerobic prokaryotes for

which oxygen is toxic. Then the high oxygen levels made possible a rapid
diversification of life on land and in the seas. A relatively short period
known as the Cambrian explosion (535–525 million years ago) was
characterized by the sudden appearance of many present-day animal phyla.
