ther
antibiotics are being overused. What form of evolution is
antibiotic resistance an example of, and why?
a.
Gene flow because the bacteria are passing on
the resistant trait within their populations.
b.
Natural selection, because the bacteria is
adapting to a new environmental condition - the
presence of the antibiotic.
c.
Genetic drift because medical workers cannot
follow the randomly-fluctuating gene
frequencies of bacterial populations
d.
Mutation, because each bacteria must mutate to
an antibody resistant form in order to survive.

Consider a gene with only two alleles: dominant A and
recessive a. In a population of 1,000 organisms, the
fraction expressing the homozygous recessive phenotype
is 0.37.
B. The calculated allele frequencies p and q
