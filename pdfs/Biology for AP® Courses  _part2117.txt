nd
that the frequency of one resistance allele was 6.3%, while a second resistance allele’s frequency was 74.6%, and the non-
resistance allele’s frequency was 19.0%. These three frequencies add up to 100%.
[2] A population’s gene pool is the sum of
all the alleles. If these frequencies do not change over time, the population is said to be in Hardy–Weinberg principle of
equilibrium—a stable, non-evolving state. However, if a phenotype is favored by natural selection, allele frequencies can
change. If this is the case, the population is evolving. Sometimes allele frequencies within a population change randomly
with no advantage to the population over existing allele frequencies. This phenomenon is called genetic drift. An event that
initiates an allele frequency change in an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population, is
called the founder effect. In Population Genetics, we will explore how natural selection, random drift, and founder effects
can le
