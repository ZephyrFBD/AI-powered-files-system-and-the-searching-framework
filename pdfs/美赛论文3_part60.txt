each.
When water is added, it spreads to different directions to heat other water but as well
as break the even temperature. Whatâ€™s more, water in surface can exchange heat with
the air so that the upper water is colder than the rest. That means the temperature is
not even as well. Moreover, different parts of body are in different temperature and
they can also affect the water.
If you want to enjoy the bath, we strongly recommend you a spa-style tub with a
secondary heating system and circulating jets. Use that and you will get rid of all
worries about the traditional bathtub.
