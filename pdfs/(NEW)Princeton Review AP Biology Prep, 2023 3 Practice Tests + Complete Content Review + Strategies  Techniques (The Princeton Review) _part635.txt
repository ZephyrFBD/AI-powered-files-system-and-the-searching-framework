mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance on the part of the
bodyâ€™s tissues. Onset is usually much later in life and highly associated with obesity. A recent study evaluated
the relative dysfunction of mitochondria of individuals who were lean, obese, and diabetic (type 2). Muscle
biopsies were taken both prior to and after a twenty-week exercise program. The mitochondrial mass was
measured by cardiolipin, the citric acid cycle was measured by citrate synthase, and electron transport chain
activity was measured by NADH oxidase levels. The results are shown below in the table.

activity, in relative units normalized to creatine kinase activity.
(a) Explain how the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain are related and how they are affected by
exercise.
(b) Construct a graph of the data indicating citric acid cycle activity. Be sure to use error b
