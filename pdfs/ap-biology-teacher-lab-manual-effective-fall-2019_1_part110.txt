tial number of rabbits.  
Similarly, ΔF is the change in the size of the fox population.  
■ Part 4: The FOXRAB Game: 
Generating a Calculator or Spreadsheet 
Graphic Model of the Game Played over Time 
The next step of this model-building process would be to have the students create a 
calculator or spreadsheet graphic model. Spreadsheets are particularly appropriate for 
this work. Simply reinterpret the two arithmetic equations into a spreadsheet form to 
calculate the change in the rabbit and the fox populations. If each row of the spreadsheet 
represents a single generation, you can model multiple generations by using the results 
from the previous row to calculate the next row, thereby iterating the same generational 
process that students went through in the physical game version of the model. 
Have the students construct a variety of graphs, such as the following, from the  
spreadsheet or calculator results to develop a deeper understanding of the model:
