Energy and Thermodynamics
Homeostasis is the process by which a stable internal environment is
maintained within an organism. Important homeostatic mechanisms
include the maintenance of a water and solute balance (osmoregulation),
regulation of blood glucose levels, and the maintenance of a constant
body temperature. In mammals, the primary homeostatic organs are the
kidneys, liver, large intestine, and skin.
The maintenance of homeostasis within an organism uses up a
considerable amount of energy. Thus, before considering specific
homeostatic processes, it is essential to understand a few points on
energy flow and thermodynamics.
ENERGY FLOW
The ultimate energy source for living organisms is the Sun. Autotrophic
organisms, such as green plants, convert sunlight into energy stored in
the bonds of organic compounds (chie
