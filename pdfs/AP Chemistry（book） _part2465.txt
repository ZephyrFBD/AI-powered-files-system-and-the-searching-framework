The reaction quotient. The concentrations are for any time 
during a reaction. If the concentrations are equilibrium concen-
trations, then Q c = Kc.

15.1 (a) Based on the following energy profile, predict 
whether kf 7 kr or kf 6 kr. (b) Using Equation 15.5, pre-
dict whether the equilibrium constant for the process is 
greater than 1 or less than 1. [Section 15.1]

15.2 The following diagrams represent a hypothetical reaction 
A ¡  B, with A represented by red spheres and B rep-
resented by blue spheres. The sequence from left to right 
represents the system as time passes. Does the system 
reach equilibrium? If so, in which diagram(s) is the sys-
tem in equilibrium? [Sections 15.1 and 15.2]
