SYI-2.B
Describe human activities 
that lead to changes in 
ecosystem structure and/
or dynamics.
SYI-2.C
Explain how geological and 
meteorological activity leads 
to changes in ecosystem 
structure and/or dynamics.
SYI-2.B.1
The distribution of local and global ecosystems 
changes over time.
SYI-2.B.2
Human impact accelerates change at local and 
global levels—
a. The introduction of new diseases can 
devastate native species. 
b. Habitat change can occur because of 
human activity.
SYI-2.C.1
Geological and meteorological events 
affect habitat change and ecosystem 
distribution. Biogeographical studies illustrate 
these changes.
