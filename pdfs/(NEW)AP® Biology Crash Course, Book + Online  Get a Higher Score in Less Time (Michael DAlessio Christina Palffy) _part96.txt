e many growing strands by taking a 5’
phosphate and 3’ hydroxyl and linking them together, thereby helping join the Okazaki fragments into
a single strand.
6. DNA polymerases keep moving along the strands until synthesis of both strands is completed.
D. Each new molecule of DNA consists of one of the original DNA strands hydrogen bonded to its newly
synthesized complement.
E. Proofreading during DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA results in low mutation rates at the
nucleotide level.
1. DNA polymerase makes mistakes at a rate of about 1/10,000 base pairs, but proofreading and repair
mechanisms reduce that rate to 1/1,000,000,000.
2. Errors are usually corrected by enzymes that move along the new DNA molecule and replace any base
that has been mismatched.
3. DNA molecules are also susceptible to damage by chemicals or radiation and are repaired in a similar
manner.
