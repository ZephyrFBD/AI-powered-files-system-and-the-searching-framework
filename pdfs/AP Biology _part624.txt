compete against red squirrels, although what that bill would
look like is unclear.
The crossbills would have the common bill.
The crossbills would have evolved into a larger bird in order to
compete more favorably with the red squirrels.
If grown individually under short-day conditions, a short-day plant
will flower, but a long-day plant will not. However, both will flower
if they are grafted together and are exposed to short-day conditions,
as depicted in the figure below:

What can be deduced from this phenomenon?
The genes of the long-day plant mutated.
The genes of the short-day plant mutated.
There was an error in the procedure because short-day and
long-day blooming are both genetically controlled.
There must have been some chemical substance that was
transmitted from the lower flower to the upper one up the graft.
Which of the following is the most accurate explanation for how
