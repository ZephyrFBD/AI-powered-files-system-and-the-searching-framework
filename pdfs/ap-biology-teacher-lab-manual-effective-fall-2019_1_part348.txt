chondria and respire. In the final part of this 
investigation, students can explore the combined role of respiration and photosynthesis 
with experiments of their own design. For example, if a student places disks that have 
floated under light into a dark environment, plant respiration will consume the oxygen 
bubbles causing the disks to re-sink. 
Students have a difficult time understanding the properties of light and how these 
properties can affect photosynthesis. The instructor may want to include a quick 
demonstration of the inverse square law and another quick demonstration on light 
absorbance. 
If students have a solid understanding of the aforementioned concepts, they should 
be able to pose scientific questions about photosynthesis and design an experiment(s) 
around the effects of variables on the rate of photosynthesis. The skills and concepts 
may be taught through a variety of methods in an open-inquiry investigation, and 
photosynthetic rates may be measured by sever
