nstead of a hydrogen. If there is a double bond in the chain, then it is an
unsaturated fatty acid. A polyunsaturated fatty acid has many double bonds within the fatty acid.
Lipid Saturation
The extent of saturation in a lipid can affect its structure and function. The more double bonds that exist within a
lipid, the more unsaturated it is:
Notice the difference above between the saturated and unsaturated fatty acid. In general, saturated fatty acids are
relatively linear molecules, whereas unsaturated fatty acids with cis-double bonds, as above, are more kinked in their
structure. When molecules are linear, they are more easily able to stack together and interact with each other more
tightly; thus saturated fats tend to form solids at room temperature (an example is butter). When molecules are
kinked, they cannot pack as tightly and tend to be liquid at room temperature (an example is an oil).
One exception to this rule is an unsaturated fatty acid with a trans-double bond, as below:
