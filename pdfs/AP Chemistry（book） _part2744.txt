▲ Figure 17.15 Titration curve for a diprotic acid. The curve shows the pH change when 50.0 mL 
of 0.10 M H3PO3 is titrated with 0.10 M NaOH.
What is/are the dominant species in solution at pH = 4: H3PO3, 
H2PO3
-, HPO3 
2-, and/or PO3
3-? At pH = 11?
Give It Some Thought
Sketch an approximate titration curve for the titration of Na2CO3 with HCl and 
indicate where HCO3
- is the dominant species.
17.4 ∣ Solubility Equilibria
The equilibria we have considered thus far in this chapter have involved acids and bases. 
Furthermore, they have been homogeneous; that is, all the species have been in the same 
phase. Through the rest of the chapter, we will consider the equilibria involved in the dis-
solution or precipitation of ionic compounds. These reactions are heterogeneous.
