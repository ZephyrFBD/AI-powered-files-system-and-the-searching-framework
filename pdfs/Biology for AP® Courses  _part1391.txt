22. Flower position in pea plants is determined by a gene
with axial and terminal alleles. Given that axial is
dominant to terminal, list all of the possible F1 and F2
genotypes and phenotypes from a cross involving parents
that are homozygous for each trait. Express genotypes
with conventional genetic abbreviations.
a.
F1: All AA-axial; F2: AA-Axial and aa-terminal.
b.
F1: All aa-terminal; F2: AA-Axial and Aa-
terminal.
c.
F1: AA-axial and Aa-terminal; F2: All AA-axial.
d.
F1: All Aa-axial; F2: AA-Axial, Aa-Axial, an
