scheme. Group 7A, for example, is often labeled VIIA.

Chemistry (IUPAC) has proposed a convention that numbers the groups from 
 
1 through 18 with no A or B designations, as shown in Figure 2.14.

CHAPTER 2 Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
We will use the traditional North American convention with Arabic numerals and the 
letters A and B.
Elements in a group often exhibit similarities in physical and chemical properties. 
For example, the ‚Äúcoinage metals‚Äù‚Äîcopper (Cu), silver (Ag), and gold (Au)‚Äîbelong to 
group 1B. These elements are less reactive than most metals, which is why they have 
been traditionally used throughout the world to make coins. Many other groups in the
