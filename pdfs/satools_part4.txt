n a PC, you might add 3 lines like 
 
% 
SATOOLS = 'C:\Program Files\satools\m' ; 
addpath(SATOOLS) ; 
 
Save and close the file when you are finished. 
 
4. Run the startup script by typing its name at the Matlab command prompt: 
>> startup 
 
5. Check that the path was properly added by running the SA Tools version utility function 
>> satoolsversion 
The current version # of satools should echo on the screen. 
 
If necessary, see the online Matlab documentation at 
 
http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab.shtml 
for more details. 
3.  How do I run an example? 
3.1.  For Matlab 
 
1. Copy one of the example directories from the satools/m/examples/ directory to your work 
area.  For example, try the proteinfold directory. 
 
2. Start Matlab (if it is not already running) and cd into the directory you copied.  For example 
>> cd proteinfold 
 
3. Execute the try_me function in that directory.  For example 
>> try_me 
 
You should get plenty of output on the screen
