 happens not at the level of the sensory receptor, but at higher levels in the nervous system, in the brain. The brain
distinguishes sensory stimuli through a sensory pathway: action potentials from sensory receptors travel along neurons that
are dedicated to a particular stimulus. These neurons are dedicated to that particular stimulus and synapse with particular
neurons in the brain or spinal cord.
All sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, are transmitted though the central nervous system and are routed
to the thalamus and to the appropriate region of the cortex. Recall that the thalamus is a structure in the forebrain that serves
as a clearinghouse and relay station for sensory (as well as motor) signals. When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is
conducted to the specific area of the cortex (Figure 27.3) dedicated to processing that particular sense.
