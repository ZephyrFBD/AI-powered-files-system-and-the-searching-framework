 The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function

Heat Conservation and Dissipation
Animals conserve or dissipate heat in a variety of ways. In certain climates, endothermic animals have some form of
insulation, such as fur, fat, feathers, or some combination thereof. Animals with thick fur or feathers create an insulating
layer of air between their skin and internal organs. Polar bears and seals live and swim in a subfreezing environment and
yet maintain a constant, warm, body temperature. The arctic fox, for example, uses its fluffy tail as extra insulation when
it curls up to sleep in cold weather. Mammals have a residual effect from shivering and increased muscle activity: arrector
pili muscles cause “goose bumps,” causing small hairs to stand up when the individual is cold; this has the intended effect
of increasing body temperature. Mammals use layers of fat to achieve the same end. Loss of significant amounts of body fat
will compromise an individual’s ability to conserve heat.
