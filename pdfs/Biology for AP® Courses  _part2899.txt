glucose
levels.
b.
When there is excess blood sugar, excess
glucose and ATP produce glucagon. A drop in
blood glucose level stimulates the release of
glycogen, which in turn stimulates glycogen
release to increase blood glucose levels.
c.
When there is excess blood sugar, the excess
glucose and ATP produce glycogen. A drop in
blood glucose level stimulates the release of
glucagon, which in turn stimulates the release of
glycogen to increase blood glucose levels.
d.
When there is excess blood sugar, the excess
glucose and ATP produce glycogen. A drop in
blood glucose level stimulates the release of
glucagon, which in turn releases more glucagon
to increase blood glucose levels.
50. One process that is under the control of a negative
feedback loop is red blood cell production. These cells
carry oxygen to all of the body cells, and remove some
carbon dioxide. What would most likely happen if an
individual had a sufficient number of red blood cells?
a.
The individual would have increased r
