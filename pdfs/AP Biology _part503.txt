s, and then dies. The plant has evolved a strategy to
increase probability of success through sheer numbers when the
environment is in flux and the population has decreased.
K-strategists, which are repeat reproducers, are favored in a stable
environment where competition for resources is intense, and where
adults are more likely to survive to breed again. With intense
competition, a few relatively large offspring may have a better
chance at survival. An example is the loggerhead sea turtle, which
lays about 300 eggs per year and may continue to lay eggs for 30 or
more years.
A Case Study—The Hare and the Lynx
An excellent study in population growth involves the populations of
snowshoe hare and lynx at the Hudson Bay Company, which kept records
of the pelts sold by trappers from 1850–1930. The data reveal fluctuations
in the populations of both animals. The hare feeds on the grass, and the
lynx feeds on the hare. So the cycles in the lynx population are probably
caused by cyclic fluctu
