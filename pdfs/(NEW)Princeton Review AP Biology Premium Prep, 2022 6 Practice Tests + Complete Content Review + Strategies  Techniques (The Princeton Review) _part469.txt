e population itself could be. There could have been sampling bias or errors in the
data collection, which can lead to sample data that doesnâ€™t match population data. The best way to fix this is usually
to increase the sample size. Histograms differ from bar graphs in that they show ranges instead of just categories.
Nonparametric data requires a different set of descriptive statistics than parametric data.
The median is the middle number in a dataset and is determined by putting the numbers in consecutive order and
finding the middle number. If there is an odd number of numbers, there will be a single number that is the median. If
there is an even number of numbers, the median is determined by averaging the two middle numbers. Therefore, the
median is not necessarily one of the numbers in the dataset. The median is useful in gauging the midpoint of the
data, but will not necessarily tell you much about outliers.
The mode is the most frequently recurring number in the dataset. If there
