they do not produce enough insulin to overcome insulin
resistance (decreased ability to respond to insulin). Based on the
diagram, which of the following describes the treatment that is
most likely to be eﬀective for type 2 diabetes?
A drug that stimulates insulin secretion by blocking ATP-
dependent potassium channels
(A)
A drug that closes the voltage-gated calcium channels to
inhibit exocytosis of insulin
(B)
A drug that opens the ligand-gated potassium channel to
promote insulin secretion
(C)
A drug that inhibits glucose uptake and usage to increase
glucose levels
(D)
8. Researchers directed a narrow beam heat lamp at the thorax of
tethered sphinx moths to simulate heat generation from flight.
The results are shown in the graphs below.
In a second experiment, the researchers investigated the eﬀect of
circulation between the thorax and abdomen of free-flying moths
on body temperature. For half of the moth population, the
researchers prevented the circulation between the thorax a
