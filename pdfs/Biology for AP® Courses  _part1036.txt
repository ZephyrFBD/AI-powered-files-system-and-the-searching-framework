Hemophilia is a rare condition in which the blood lacks sufficient clotting factors. These factors are required for the
platelets to bind together and form clots. How does this interfere with the cell signals during wound healing?
a.
delay and prevention of the cell signal required for wound healing
b.
activate the cell signal required for wound healing
c.
activate and enhance the cell signals for wound healing
d.
cell signal will remain unaffected
Phosphorylation
One of the most common chemical modifications that occurs in signaling pathways is the addition of a phosphate group
(PO4â€“3) to a molecule such as a protein in a process called phosphorylation. The phosphate can be added to a nucleotide
such as GMP to form GDP or GTP. Phosphates are also often added to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of proteins,
where they replace the hydroxyl group o
