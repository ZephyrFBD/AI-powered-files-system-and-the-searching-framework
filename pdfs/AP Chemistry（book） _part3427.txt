vier ele-
ments owe their existence to subsequent nuclear reactions that occur 
in stars. These heavier elements are not all created in equal amounts, 
however. In our solar system, for example, carbon and oxygen are a 
million times more abundant than lithium and boron, and over 100 
million times more abundant than beryllium (Figure 21.21)! In fact, 
of the elements heavier than helium, carbon and oxygen are the most 
abundant. This is more than an academic curiosity given the fact that 
these elements, together with hydrogen, are the most important ele-
ments for life on Earth. Letâ€™s look at the factors responsible for the 
relatively high abundance of carbon and oxygen in the universe.
A star is born from a cloud of gas and dust called a nebula. When 
conditions are right, gravitational forces collapse the cloud, and its 
core density and temperature rise until nuclear fusion commences. 
Hydrogen nuclei fuse to form deuterium, 2
1H, and eventually 4
2He
