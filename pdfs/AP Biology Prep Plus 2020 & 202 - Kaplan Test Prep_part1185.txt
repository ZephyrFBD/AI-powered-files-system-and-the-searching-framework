esults for α-type cells will be the same trend as a-type cells. 
4. Scoring Guidelines for Free-Response Question 4
(a) Explain what would happen to an animal cell placed in a hypotonic
solution. (1 point)
Explanation (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
In a hypotonic solution, water will move into the cell since the extracellular
fluid has a lower solute concentration. This will cause the animal cell to swell.
Since animal cells do not have cell walls like plant cells, their cell membranes
cannot withstand as much pressure and may burst.
(b) Explain under what conditions plant cells may experience plasmolysis.
(1 point )
Explanation (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Plant cells experience plasmolysis when a plant does not receive sufficient
water and the extracellular fluid becomes hypertonic. In a hypertonic
environment, water leaves the plant’s cells, which causes the cells to lose
turgor pressure, shrink, and exp
