e standard error of the mean 
 is another measure of how spread out a data set is. Each time you repeat
an experiment, random chance will lead to slightly different means. If an experiment is repeated multiple times and a
mean is calculated for each experiment, the standard error of the mean predicts the distribution of the means of those
repeated experiments. The prediction would be that 95% of the means would fall within two standard errors of the
mean (above or below the mean of the original experiment). If the standard error of the mean is large, repeating the
experiment will result in a larger range of means than if the standard error of the mean was small. Data sets with
smaller standard errors of the mean are considered more accurate.
Standard error of the mean is calculated with the following formula:
In the above formula:
s = standard deviation
n = sample size
Notice that as the sample size (n) increases, the standard error of the mean decreases. You may already
