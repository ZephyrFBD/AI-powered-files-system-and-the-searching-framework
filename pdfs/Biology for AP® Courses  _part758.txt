r high?
Explain your reasoning.
a.
EA for ATP hydrolysis is high because
considerable energy is released.
b.
EA for ATP hydrolysis is low because
considerable energy is released.
c.
EA for ATP hydrolysis is intermediate because
considerable energy is released.
d.
EA for ATP hydrolysis is high because a low
amount of energy is released.
42. What is phosphorylation as it occurs in chemical
reactions?
a.
Phosphorylation refers to the attachment of a
phosphate to another molecule to facilitate a
chemical reaction.
b.
Phosphorylation is the uptake of a phosphorous
molecule by an ATP molecule to power
chemical reactions.
c.
Phosphorylation is the release of a third
phosphorous molecule of ATP during hydrolysis.
d.
Phosphorylation is the breakdown of a
pyrophosphate molecule which gives phosphate
ions.
43. If a chemical reaction could occur without an enzyme,
why is it important to have one?
a.
Enzymes are important because they give the
desired products only from the reaction.
b.
Enzymes are
