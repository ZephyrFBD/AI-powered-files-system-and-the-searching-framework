1. Below is a diagram of the cell cycle, in which the length of each
labeled arc is roughly proportional to the time that a cell spends
in that corresponding stage of the cell cycle.
Which of the following most accurately describes a reason for the
relative lengths of these stages?
During the S phase, the cell synthesizes all the proteins
necessary to carry out the various functions of the cell, so the
S phase must be shorter than the G phases so that newly
synthesized proteins have time to carry out their functions.
(A)
Most of the time of the cell cycle is dedicated to the G phases
so that the cell can grow, absorb nutrients, and synthesize
the various biomolecules and organelles necessary for the
survival and eﬀective functioning of daughter cells.
(B)
The M phase is shorter than the S phase because if the M
phase took longer, the newly-synthesized chromosomes
would become so unstable that one of the two dau
