Cholesterol, shown in Figure 24.11, is a biochemically important alcohol. The OH 
group forms only a small component of this molecule, so cholesterol is only slightly sol-
uble in water (2.6 g/L of H2O). Cholesterol is a normal and essential component of our 
bodies; when present in excessive amounts, however, it may precipitate from solution. It 
precipitates in the gallbladder to form crystalline lumps called gallstones. It may also pre-
cipitate against the walls of veins and arteries and thus contribute to high blood pressure 
and other cardiovascular problems.
ethers
Compounds in which two hydrocarbon groups are bonded to one oxygen are called 
ethers. Ethers can be formed from two molecules of alcohol by eliminating a molecule 
of water. The reaction is catalyzed by sulfuric acid, which takes up water to remove it 
from the system:
 
CH3CH2¬OH + H¬OCH2CH3 ¡
H2SO4  CH3CH2¬O ¬CH2CH3 + H2O [24.16]
A reaction in which water is eliminated from t
