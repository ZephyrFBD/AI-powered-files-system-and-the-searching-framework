her in 
the anode than in the cathode. Thus, electrons flow spontaneously toward the electrode 
with the more positive electrical potential.
The difference in potential energy per electrical charge (the potential difference) 
between two electrodes is measured in volts. One volt (V) is the potential difference 
required to impart 1 joule (J) of energy to a charge of 1 coulomb (C):
 
1 V = 1 J

Recall that one electron has a charge of 1.60 * 10-19 C. 
 (Section 2.2)
The potential difference between the two electrodes of a voltaic cell is called the cell 
potential, denoted Ecell. Because the potential difference provides the driving force that 
pushes electrons through the external circuit, we also call it the electromotive (“caus-
ing electron motion”) force, or emf. Because Ecell is measured in volts, it is also com-
monly called the voltage of the cell.
The cell potential of any voltaic cell is positive. The magnitude of the cell poten-
tial depends on the reactions that occur at t
