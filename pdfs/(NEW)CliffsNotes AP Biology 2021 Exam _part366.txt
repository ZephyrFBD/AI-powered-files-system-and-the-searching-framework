The end product of this process is a genomic library, a collection of bacteria, each of which contain a fragment of
the genome of the foreign DNA but together contain the entire genome of the foreign DNA.
When foreign genes are inserted into the genome of a bacterium, introns often prevent their transcription. To avoid
this problem, the DNA fragment bearing the required gene is obtained directly from the mRNA that codes for the
desired polypeptide. Reverse transcriptase (obtained from retroviruses) is used to make a DNA molecule directly
from the mRNA. DNA obtained in this manner is called complementary DNA (cDNA) and comprise cDNA
libraries that lack the introns that suppress transcription.
As a result of DNA cloning, the human gene for insulin was inserted into E. coli. The transformed E. coli produces
insulin, which is isolated and used to treat diabetes.
The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique that makes large numbers of DNA cop
