 values for four substances. The values of ∆Hvap tend 
to be larger than the values of ∆Hfus because in the transition from liquid to gas, particles 
must essentially sever all their interparticle attractions, whereas in the transition from 
solid to liquid, many of these attractive interactions remain operative.

CHAPTER 11 Liquids and Intermolecular Forces
The particles of a solid can move directly into the gaseous state. The enthalpy 
change required for this transition is called the heat of sublimation, denoted ∆Hsub. 
As illustrated in Figure 11.20, ∆Hsub is the sum of ∆Hfus
