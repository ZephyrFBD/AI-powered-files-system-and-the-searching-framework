ng-day plants.
The photoreceptor responsible for keeping track of the length of day
and night is the pigment phytochrome. There are two forms of
phytochrome: Pr (red light–absorbing) and Pfr (infrared light–
absorbing). Phytochrome is synthesized in the Pr form. When the plant is
exposed to light, Pr converts to Pfr. In the dark, Pfr reverts back to Pr. The
conversion from one to the other enables the plant to keep track of time.
The plant is able to sense the concentrations of the two phytochromes and
respond accordingly.

CHAPTER SUMMARY
Think of this chapter as a source of illustrative examples that can
help you on your free-response questions on the AP exam. One
thing the College Board is emphatic about is that it wants students
to demonstrate that they can make connections between topics and
across various domains.
Knowing the structure of leaves and of stomates will help you
