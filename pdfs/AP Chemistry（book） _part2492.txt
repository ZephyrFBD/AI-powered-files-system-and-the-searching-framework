d in 
a 2.0-L container, what is the partial pressure of all sub-
stances after equilibrium is reached?
 15.80 For the equilibrium
PH3BCl31s2 ∆ PH31g2 + BCl31g2
 
 Kp = 0.052 at 60 °C. (a) Calculate Kc. (b) After 3.00 g of 
solid PH3BCl3 is added to a closed 1.500-L vessel at 60 °C, 
the vessel is charged with 0.0500 g of BCl31g2. What is the 
equilibrium concentration of PH3?
 [15.81] Solid NH4SH is introduced into an evacuated flask at 
24 °C. The following reaction takes place:
NH4SH1s2 ∆ NH31g2 + H2S1g2
 
 At equilibrium, the total pressure (for NH3 and H2S taken 
together) is 0.614 atm. What is Kp for this equilibrium at 
24 °C?
 [15.82] A 0.831-g sample of SO3 is placed in a 1.00-L container 
and heated to 1100 K. The SO3 decomposes to SO2 and O2:
2 SO31g2 ∆ 2 SO21g2 + O21g2
 
 At equilibrium, the total pressure in the container is 1.300 
atm. Find the values of Kp and Kc for this reaction at 1
100 K.
