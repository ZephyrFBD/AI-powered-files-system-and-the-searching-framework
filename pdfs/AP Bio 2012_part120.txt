Learning Objective 
2.12: The student is able to use representations and models 
to analyze situations or solve problems qualitatively and 
quantitatively to investigate whether dynamic homeostasis 
is maintained by the active movement of molecules across 
membranes.
(A)
This option is incorrect because the parameciumâ€™s plasma membrane is 
not permeable to charged ions, so no salt will enter. If salt could enter the 
paramecium, then water would follow by osmosis and actually result in increasing 
contractions of the contractile vacuole.
(B)
This option is correct. The lower the concentration of solute, the larger the 
gradient between the paramecium and the solution. When the paramecium is 
hypertonic to the low concentration solution, water will enter the paramecium 
by osmosis. If the paramecium does not pump excess water back out, it will 
burst. As the solution gradient decreases, less water will enter, and, therefore, 
there
