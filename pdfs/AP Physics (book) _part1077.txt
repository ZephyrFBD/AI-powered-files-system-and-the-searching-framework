cations of Bernoulli’s principle is to explain a TIA,
a transient ischemic attack (meaning a temporary lack of blood supply to the brain).
A person suffering a TIA may experience symptoms such as dizziness, double
vision, headache, and weakness of the limbs. A TIA can occur as follows. Blood
normally flows up to the brain at the back of the head via the two vertebral
arteries—one going up each side of the neck—which meet to form the basilar
artery just below the brain, as shown in Fig. 10–28. Each vertebral artery connects
to the subclavian artery, as shown, before the blood passes to the arms. When 
an arm is exercised vigorously, blood flow increases to meet the needs of the
arm’s muscles. If the subclavian artery on one side of the body is partially blocked,
however, as in arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), the blood velocity 
will have to be higher on that side to supply the needed blood. (Recall the equa-
tion of continuity: smaller area means larger velocity for the sa
