als. For each value of n, the three p orbitals have the same size and shape but differ from 
one another in spatial orientation. We usually represent p orbitals by drawing the shape 
and orientation of their wave functions, as shown in the contour representations in 
Figure 6.23(b). It is convenient to label these as px, py, and pz orbitals. The letter subscript 
indicates the Cartesian axis along which the orbital is oriented. Thus, we see that two

CHAPTER 6 Electronic Structure of Atoms
*We cannot make a simple correspondence between the subscripts 1x, y, and z2 and the allowed 
ml values 11, 0, and -12. To explain why this is so is beyond the scope of an introductory text.
Give It Some Thought
Consider 3px and 3py orbitals. Which quantum number(s) is (are) the same for these 
two orbitals? Which quantum number(s) is (are) different?
orbitals with the same value of n and l, but different values of ml, differ from each other 
in the way they are oriented in space.* L
