o 3' direction, and the FACT complex moves and reassembles
nucleosomes as the polymerase passes by. Whereas RNA polymerases I and III terminate transcription by protein- or RNA
hairpin-dependent methods, RNA polymerase II transcribes for 1,000 or more nucleotides beyond the gene template and
cleaves the excess during pre-mRNA processing.
15.4 RNA Processing in Eukaryotes
Eukaryotic pre-mRNAs are modified with a 5' methylguanosine cap and a poly-A tail. These structures protect the mature
mRNA from degradation and help export it from the nucleus. Pre-mRNAs also undergo splicing, in which introns are
removed and exons are reconnected with single-nucleotide accuracy. Only finished mRNAs that have undergone 5'
capping, 3' polyadenylation, and intron splicing are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Pre-rRNAs and pre-
tRNAs may be processed by intramolecular cleavage, splicing, methylation, and chemical conversion of nucleotides.
Rarely, RNA editing is also performed to insert missin
