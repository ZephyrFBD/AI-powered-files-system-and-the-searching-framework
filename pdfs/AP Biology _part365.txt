ged with a large amount of proteins called histones and
then supercoiled into the familiar X- or Y-shaped structure we
recognize as a chromosome.
DNA replicates in a semiconservative pattern. Each strand serves
as a template for the formation of a new strand composed of
complementary nucleotides: A with T and C with G. The process
requires many enzymes, including primase and DNA polymerase.
The enzyme DNA polymerase also carries out proofreading by the
process of mismatch repair.
The sequence of nucleotides in DNA is also the template for
protein synthesis. Through the processes of transcription in the
nucleus and translation at ribosomes, genetic information is
transmitted with a high degree of fidelity. Errors, called mutations,
randomly occur. Remember that changes in an organism’s genotype
may alter its phenotype and make the organism more or less
