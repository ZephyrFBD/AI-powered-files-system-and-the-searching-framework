environment will fold so that the hydrophilic R groups are at the surface
and the hydrophobic R groups are on the inside of the protein. This three-
dimensional folding, due to interactions between the R groups of amino
acids, is a protein’s tertiary structure. R group interactions include
hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, London
dispersion forces, hydrophobic interactions, and covalent disulfide
bonds. The orientation and arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains
or subunits constitute a protein’s quaternary structure. Hemoglobin,
which consists of two α and two β subunits, is an example of a protein
with quaternary structure. Protein structure is important to its function: if
a protein loses its shape (is denatured) at any structural level, its function
will likely be diminished and possibly lost entirely.
NUCLEIC ACIDS
Nucleic acids encode biological information in nucleotide sequences and
provide information for protein synthesis. Nucleotides are compos
