s
of enzyme regulatory molecules, with respect to cellular metabolism, are the products of the cellular metabolic reactions
themselves. In a most efficient and elegant way, cells have evolved to use the products of their own reactions for feedback
inhibition of enzyme activity. Feedback inhibition involves the use of a reaction product to regulate its own further
production (Figure 6.21). The cell responds to the abundance of specific products by slowing down production during
anabolic or catabolic reactions. Such reaction products may inhibit the enzymes that catalyzed their production through the
mechanisms described above.

Figure 6.21 Metabolic pathways are a series of reactions catalyzed by multiple enzymes. Feedback inhibition, where
the end product of the pathway inhibits an upstream step, is an important regulatory mechanism in cells.
