(a) Using the data in the table, create a phylogenetic tree on the template provided to reflect the 
evolutionary relationships of the organisms. Provide reasoning for the placement on the tree 
of the species that is least related to the others.  
Phylogenetic tree (1 point)  
NOTE: There can be free rotation around the nodes in the tree. 
 
 
Reasoning (1 point) 
• 
D. polylepis has the most differences in amino acids (or changes in DNA or proteins as 
they relate to amino acids). 
 
(b) Identify whether morphological data or amino acid sequence data are more likely to 
accurately represent the true evolutionary relationships among the species, and provide 
reasoning for your answer.
