CHAPTER 16 Acid–Base Equilibria
A student prepared a 0.10 M solution of formic acid (HCOOH) and found its pH at 25 °C to be 2.38. Calculate Ka for formic acid 
at this temperature.
Solve
The first step in solving any equilibrium problem is 
to write the equation for the equilibrium reaction. 
The ionization of formic acid can be written as:
Analyze We are given the molar concentration of an aqueous solu-
tion of weak acid and the pH of the solution, and we are asked to 
determine the value of Ka for the acid.
Check The magnitude of our answer is reasonable because Ka for a 
weak acid is usually between 10-2 and 10-10.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
A 0.50 M solution of an acid HA has pH = 2.24. What is the 
value of Ka for the acid? (a) 1.7 * 10-12 (b) 3.3 * 10-5   
(c) 6.6 * 10-5 (d) 5.8 * 10-3 (e) 1.2 * 10-2
HCOOH1aq2 ∆ H+1aq2 + HCOO-1aq2
 
pH = -log 3H+4 = 2.38
 
log3H+4 = -2.38
 
3H+4 = 10-2.38 = 4.2 * 1
