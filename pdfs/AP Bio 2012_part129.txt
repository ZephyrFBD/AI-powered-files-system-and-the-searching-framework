Question 32
Essential Knowledge
1.B.2: Phylogenetic trees and cladograms are graphical 
representations (models) of evolutionary history that can 
be tested.
Science Practice
1.1: The student can create representations and models  
of natural or man-made phenomena and systems in  
the domain.
Learning Objective 
1.19: The student is able create a phylogenetic tree or 
simple cladogram that correctly represents evolutionary 
history and speciation from a provided data set.
(A)
This option is incorrect. The nucleotide differences between species 5 and 1 in the 
data set are high and do not represent a close relationship.
(B)
This option is incorrect. Even though the nucleotide differences between species 
5 and 3 in the data set show a close relationship, species 3 and 4 have fewer 
differences and thus
