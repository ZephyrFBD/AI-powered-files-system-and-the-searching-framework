ng viable offspring, but
they are considered separate subspecies due to geographic or behavioral isolation or other factors.
Figure 20.6 shows how the levels move toward specificity with other organisms. Notice how the dog shares a domain
with the widest diversity of organisms, including plants and butterflies. At each sublevel, the organisms become more
similar because they are more closely related. Historically, scientists classified organisms using characteristics, but as DNA
technology developed, more precise phylogenies have been determined.

Figure 20.6 At each sublevel in the taxonomic classification system, organisms become more similar. Dogs
and wolves are the same species because they can breed and produce viable offspring, but they are different
enough to be classified as different subspecies. (credit “plant”: modification of work by "berduchwal"/Flickr;
