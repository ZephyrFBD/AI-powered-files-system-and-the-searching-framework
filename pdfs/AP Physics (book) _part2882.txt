 distant horizontal object which
subtends an angle of 40°, the lens produces an image that
extends across the full horizontal extent of the camera’s
light-recording medium (film or electronic sensor). Deter-
mine the focal length f of the “normal”lens for the following
types of cameras: (a) a 35-mm camera that records images
on film 36 mm wide; (b) a digital camera that records
images on a charge-coupled device (CCD) 1.60 cm wide.
81. The objective lens and the eyepiece of a telescope are
spaced 85 cm apart. If the eyepiece is 
what is the
total magnification of the telescope?
82. Sam purchases 
eyeglasses which correct his faulty
vision to put his near point at 25 cm. (Assume he wears the
lenses 2.0 cm from his eyes.) Calculate (a) the focal length
of Sam’s glasses, (b) Sam’s near point without glasses. (c) Pam,
who has normal eyes with near point at 25 cm, puts on Sam’s
glasses. Calculate Pam’s near point with Sam’s glasses on.
