nergy diagram of Figure 23.28.
It might seem like the energy of the dx2 - y2 orbital should be different from that of 
the dz2 orbital because the dx2 - y2 has four lobes pointing at ligands and the dz2 has only 
two lobes pointing at ligands. However, the dz2 orbital does have electron density in the 
xy plane, represented by the ring encircling the point where the two lobes meet. More 
advanced calculations show that two orbitals do indeed have the same energy in the 
presence of the octahedral crystal-field.

Which d orbitals have lobes that point directly toward the ligands in an 
octahedral crystal-field?
