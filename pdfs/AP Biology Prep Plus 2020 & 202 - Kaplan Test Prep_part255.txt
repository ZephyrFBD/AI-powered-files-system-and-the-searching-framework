 this root pressure. During the day, transpiration occurs at a high
enough rate that dew is generally not seen, because the water that leaves
the tips of the grass is evaporating before it can build up.
Phloem
Phloem tubes are much thinner-walled than xylem and are found toward
the outside edges of stems. They begin up in the leaves, where sugars are
made by photosynthesis and stored as starch within mesophyll cells.
Much of this sugar and starch, though, is transported down phloem tubes
from shoots to roots (from leaves and stems to the roots). Active
transport between the mesophyll cells, where sugar is made, and the
nearby phloem tubes is what allows sugar to move into the phloemâ€™s
sieve tubes. The active transport pumps are symport pumps that move
one H+ ion along with every sucrose molecule. The H+ that is used to push
the sucrose across into the phloem is rapidly transported back out to the
mesophyll cells by an H+ ion ATPase pump, so that more sucrose can be
moved. As sugar is l
