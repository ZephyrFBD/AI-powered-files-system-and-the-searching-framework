eeps and moans. Mr. Carmody snuffles and looks puzzled.The priest 
 
 recites the Latin prayers and sprinkles the coffin with holy water. 
 
 I want to go to the priest, to Mr. and Mrs. Carmody. I want to tell 
 
 them how I’m the one who sent Theresa to hell.They can do whatever 
 
 they like with me.Abuse me.Revile me.Throw grave dirt at me. But I 
 
 stay behind the tree till the mourners leave and the grave diggers fill in 
 
 the grave. 
 
 Frost is already whitening the fresh earth on the grave and I think 
 
 of Theresa cold in the coffin, the red hair, the green eyes. I can’t understand 
 
 the feelings going through me but I know that with all the people 
 
 who died in my family and all the people who died in the lanes 
 
 around me and all the people who left I never had a pain like this in my 
 
 heart and I hope I never will again. 
 
 It’s getting dark. I walk my bicycle out of the graveyard. I have 
 
 telegrams to deliver.
