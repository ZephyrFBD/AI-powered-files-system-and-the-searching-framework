 size. By 
using dimensional analysis and by estimating answers, you can read-
ily check the reasonableness of your calculations.
You can get better at making estimates by practicing in everyday 
life. How far is it from your dorm room to the chemistry lecture hall? 
How much do your parents pay for gasoline per year? How many 
bikes are there on campus? If you respond “I have no idea” to these 
questions, you’re giving up too easily. Try estimating familiar quanti-
ties and you’ll get better at making estimates in science and in other 
aspects of your life where a misjudgment can be costly.
