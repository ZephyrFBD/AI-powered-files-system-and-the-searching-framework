val of pollutants from soil or groundwater, as well as hazardous elements from
contaminated sites. These uses of microbes are called bioremediation technologies. Microbiologists can
also work in the field of bioinformatics, providing specialized knowledge and insight for the design,
development, and specificity of computer models of, for example, bacterial epidemics.
Cell Size
At 0.1 to 5.0 μm in diameter, prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which have diameters ranging
from 10 to 100 μm (Figure 4.6). The small size of prokaryotes allows ions and organic molecules that enter them to quickly
diffuse to other parts of the cell. Similarly, any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly diffuse out. This is
not the case in eukaryotic cells, which have developed different structural adaptations to enhance intracellular transport.
Figure 4.6 This figure shows relative sizes of microbes on a logarithmic scale (recall that each unit of increase in a
