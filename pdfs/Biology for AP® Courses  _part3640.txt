lipids and
lipoproteins, acts like a detergent in the airways to reduce surface tension and allow for opening of the alveoli.
Breathing and gas exchange are both altered by changes in the compliance and resistance of the lung. If the compliance of
the lung decreases, as occurs in restrictive diseases like fibrosis, the airways stiffen and collapse upon exhalation. Air
becomes trapped in the lungs, making breathing more difficult. If resistance increases, as happens with asthma or
emphysema, the airways become obstructed, trapping air in the lungs and causing breathing to become difficult.
Alterations in the ventilation of the airways or perfusion of the arteries can affect gas exchange. These changes in
ventilation and perfusion, called V/Q mismatch, can arise from anatomical or physiological changes.
