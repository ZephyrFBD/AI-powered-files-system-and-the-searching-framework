A 4.00-g sample of a mixture of CaO and BaO is placed in a 
1.00-L vessel containing CO2 gas at a pressure of 730 torr 
and a temperature of 25 °C. The CO2 reacts with the CaO 
and BaO, forming CaCO3 and BaCO3. When the reaction 
is complete, the pressure of the remaining CO2 is 150 torr. 
 
(a) Calculate the number of moles of CO2 that have reacted. 
(b) Calculate the mass percentage of CaO in the mixture.

Ammonia and hydrogen chloride react to form solid 
 
ammonium chloride:
 
 
NH31g2 + HCl1g2 ¡ NH4Cl1s2
 
  
Two 2.00-L flasks at 25 °C are connected by a valve, 
as shown in the drawing. One flask contains 5.00 g 
 
of NH31g2, and the other contains 5.00 g of HCl(g). When 
the valve is opened, the gases react until one is completely 
consumed. (a) Which gas will remain in the system after 
the reaction is complete? (b) What will be the final pres-
sure of the
