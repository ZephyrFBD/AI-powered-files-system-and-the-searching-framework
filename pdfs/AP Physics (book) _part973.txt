 pointed arch,
the forces due to the weight above could be brought down more nearly vertically,
so less horizontal buttressing would be needed. The pointed arch reduced the load on
the walls, so there could be more window openings and light. The smaller buttressing
needed was provided on the outside by graceful flying buttresses (Fig. 9–30).
The technical innovation of the pointed arch was achieved not through calcula-
tion but through experience and intuition; it was not until much later that detailed
calculations, such as those presented earlier in this Chapter, came into use.
