fimicola is examined. Sexual reproduction in
this fungus involves the fusion of two nuclei—a (+) strain and a (–) strain—to form a diploid zygote. This zygote
immediately undergoes meiosis to produce asci, which contain eight haploid spores each.
During meiosis, crossing-over can occur to increase genetic variation. If crossing-over, or recombination, has
occurred, different genetic combinations will be observed in the offspring when compared with the parent
strain.
These offspring with new genetic combinations are called recombinants. By examining the numbers of
recombinants with the total number of offspring, an estimate of the linkage map distance between two genes can
be calculated with the following equation.
Map distance (in map units) = [(# recombinants) / (# total offspring)] × 100.
LAB 8: BIOTECHNOLOGY: BACTERIAL TRANSFORMATION
In this lab, the principles of genetic engineering are studied. Biotechnologists are able to insert genes into an
organism’s DNA in order to introduce
