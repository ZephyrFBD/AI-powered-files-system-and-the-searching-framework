is the process by which an external signal is transmitted to the inside of a cell. It usually
involves the following three steps:
1. a signaling molecule binding to a specific receptor
2. activation of a signal transduction pathway
3. production of a cellular response
Hydrophobic signaling molecules, like cholesterol-based steroid hormones, can diffuse across the plasma
membrane. These molecules can bind receptors inside the cell and often travel to the nucleus where they regulate
gene expression.
For signaling molecules that cannot enter the cell, a plasma membrane receptor is required. Plasma membrane
receptors form an important class of integral membrane proteins that transmit signals from the extracellular space
into the cytoplasm. Each receptor binds a particular molecule in a highly specific way. There are three classes of
membrane receptors.
1. Ligand-gated ion channels in the plasma membrane open an ion channel upon binding a particular ligand. An
example is the ligand-gated so
