atoms so that they are mirror images. As shown in Figure 2.28, an amino acid alanine example, the two
structures are non-superimposable. In nature, only the L-forms of amino acids are used to make proteins. Some D forms of
amino acids are seen in the cell walls of bacteria, but never in their proteins. Similarly, the D-form of glucose is the main
product of photosynthesis and the L-form of the molecule is rarely seen in nature.
Figure 2.28 D-alanine and L-alanine are examples of enantiomers or mirror images. Only the L-forms of amino acids
are used to make proteins.
Functional Groups
Functional groups are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to those
molecules. They are found along the “carbon backbone” of macromolecules. This carbon backbone is formed by chains
and/or rings of carbon atoms with the occasional substitution of an element such as nitrogen or oxygen. Molecules with
other elements in their carbon backbone are substituted hydro
