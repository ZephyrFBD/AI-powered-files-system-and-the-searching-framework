â—€ Figure 19.6 Possible arrangements of two  
gas molecules in two flasks. (a) Before the 
stopcock is opened, both molecules are 
in the left flask. (b) After the stopcock 
is opened, there are four possible 
arrangements of the two molecules.

possible arrangements for the two molecules once both flasks are available to them. 
Because the molecular motion is random, all four arrangements are equally likely. 
Note that now only one arrangement corresponds to the situation before the stopcock 
was opened: both molecules in the left flask.
Figure 19.6(b) shows that with both flasks available to the molecules, the probability 
of the red molecule being in the left flask is two in four (top right and bottom left arrange-
ments), and the probability of the blue molecule being in the left flask is the same (top 
left and bottom left arrangements). Because the probability is 2>4 = 1>2 that each molecule 
is in the left flask, the pro
