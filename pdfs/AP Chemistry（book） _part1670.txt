in Appendix B.)
Partial Pressures (Section 10.6)
 10.61 Consider the apparatus shown in the following drawing. 
 
(a) When the valve between the two containers is opened 
and the gases are allowed to mix, how does the volume occu-
pied by the N2 gas change? What is the partial pressure of N2 
after mixing? (b) How does the volume of the O2 gas change 
when the gases mix? What is the partial pressure of O2 in the 
mixture? (c) What is the total pressure in the container after 
the gases mix?

 10.62  Consider a mixture of two gases, A and B, confined in a 
closed vessel. A quantity of a third gas, C, is added to the 
same vessel at the same temperature. How does the addition 
of gas C affect the following: (a) the partial pressure of gas A, 
(b) the total pressure in the vessel, (c) the mole fraction of 
gas B?
