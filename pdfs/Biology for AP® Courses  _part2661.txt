other action.
c.
Yes, water level can be equalized by adding solute to the left side of the tube so that water moves toward the
left until the water levels are equal.
d.
No, water level cannot be equalized by adding solutes because solutes are always pulled down by gravity,
thereby not letting water equalize.
Pressure Potential
Pressure potential (Ψp), also called turgor potential, may be positive or negative (Figure 23.32). Because pressure is an
expression of energy, the higher the pressure, the more potential energy in a system, and vice versa. Therefore, a positive
Ψp (compression) increases Ψtotal, and a negative Ψp (tension) decreases Ψtotal. Positive pressure inside cells is contained
by the cell wall, producing turgor pressure. Pressure potentials are typically around 0.6–0.8 MPa, but can reach as high as
1.5 MPa in a well-watered plant. A Ψp of 1.5 MPa equates to 210 pounds per square inch (1.5 MPa x 140 lb in-2 MPa-1 =
210 lb/in-2). As a comparison, most automobile tires are
