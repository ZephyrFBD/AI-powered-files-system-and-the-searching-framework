ust be equal to the frequency of the
circulating protons. When ions of charge q are circulating within the hollow dees,
the net force F on each ion is due to the magnetic field B, so
where v is
the speed of the ion at a given moment (Eq. 20–4). The magnetic force is perpen-
dicular to both and , and does not speed up the ions but causes them to move
in circles; the acceleration within the dees is centripetal and equals 
where r
is the radius of the ion’s path at a given moment. We use Newton’s second law,
and find that
when the protons are within the dees (not the gap), so their (constant) speed at
radius r is
The time required for a complete revolution is the period T and is equal to
Hence the frequency of revolution f is

This is known as the cyclotron frequency.
Cyclotron. A small cyclotron of maximum radius
accelerates protons in a 1.7 T magnetic field. Calculate (a) the
frequency needed for the applied alternating voltage, and (b) the kinetic energy
of protons when they leav
