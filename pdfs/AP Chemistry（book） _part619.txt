actants are an acid, HNO3, and a base, Ca1OH22.  
The volume and molarity of HNO3 are given, and we are asked  
how many grams of Ca1OH22 are needed to neutralize this  
quantity of HNO3.
Plan Following the steps outlined by the green arrows in Figure 4.17, 
we use the molarity and volume of the HNO3 solution (substance 
B in Figure 4.17) to calculate the number of moles of HNO3. We 
then use the balanced equation to relate moles of HNO3 to moles 
of Ca1OH22 (substance A). Finally, we use the molar mass to con-
vert moles to grams of Ca1OH22:
VHNO3 * MHNO3 1 mol HNO3 1 mol Ca1OH22 1 g Ca1OH22
Solve
The product of the molar concentration 
of a solution and its volume in liters gives 
the number of moles of solute:
Because this is a neutralization reaction, 
HNO3 and Ca1OH22 react to form H2O and 
the salt containing Ca2+ and NO3
-:
2 HNO31aq2 + Ca1OH221s2 ยก 2 H2O1l2 + Ca1NO3221aq2
