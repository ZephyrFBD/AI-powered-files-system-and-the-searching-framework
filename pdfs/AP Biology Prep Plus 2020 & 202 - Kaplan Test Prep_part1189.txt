age of speciation for A in the
figure. Sympatric speciation involves the emergence of a new species within
the geographic range of its parent population, which is shown in the initial
stage of speciation for B. Thus, A is allopatric speciation and B is sympatric
speciation.
(d)Â Explain whether allopatric or sympatric specification is the more
common mode of speciation. (1 point)
Explanation (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Allopatric speciation is represented by A, and sympatric speciation is represented by B.
Allopatric speciation is the dominant mode of speciation because geographic barriers are
more common than polymorphisms.
Allopatric speciation is more common than sympatric speciation because
species often develop when a few individuals in a population move to a
different geographical area, whether by choice or force (for example, a storm
or food shortage). Sympatric speciation is rare because it generally occurs
through polyploidy (possessing
