tes large molecules of DNA on the basis of
their rate of movement through an agarose gel in an electric field. The
smaller the molecule, the faster it runs. DNA, which is negative (due to the
presence of phosphate groups, PO4
3–), flows from cathode (–) to anode
(+). The concentration of the gel can be altered to provide a greater
impediment to the DNA, allowing for finer separation of smaller pieces.
Electrophoresis is also commonly used to separate proteins and amino
acids. If DNA is going to be run through a gel, it must first be cut up by

restriction enzymes into pieces small enough to migrate through the gel.
Once separated on a gel, the DNA can be analyzed in many ways. The
DNA strands can be sequenced to determine the sequence of bases A, C,
T, and G. The gel can also be used in a comparison with other DNA
samples. A DNA probe can also identify the location of a specific
sequence within the DNA.
