t science requires
testing of its ideas or theories to see if their predictions are borne out by exper-
iment. But theories are not “proved” by testing. First of all, no measuring
instrument is perfect, so exact confirmation is not possible. Furthermore, it is
not possible to test a theory for every possible set of circumstances. Hence a
theory cannot be absolutely verified. Indeed, the history of science tells us that
long-held theories can sometimes be replaced by new ones, particularly when
new experimental techniques provide new or contradictory data.
A new theory is accepted by scientists in some cases because its predictions
are quantitatively in better agreement with experiment than those of the older
theory. But in many cases, a new theory is accepted only if it explains a greater
range of phenomena than does the older one. Copernicus’s Sun-centered theory
of the universe (Fig. 1–2b), for example, was originally no more accurate than
Ptolemy’s Earth-centered theory (Fig. 1–2a)
