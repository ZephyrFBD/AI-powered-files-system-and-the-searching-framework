erment lactose,
they would appear as colorless. (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect
because the lac– cells contain all the proteins and amino acids
necessary to construct lactose-fermenting enzymes, provided they
have the proper genes (which they can get from extract A), so they
would appear blue. (C) is incorrect because the lac– cells contain all
the RNA molecules and nucleotides necessary to transcribe and
translate the lactose-fermenting enzymes, provided they have the
proper genes (which they can get from extract C), so they would also
appear blue. (D) is incorrect because the cells incubated with extract B
will appear colorless, as explained above.

Short strands of DNA would ordinarily not be found in the cellular
environment, so something must be preventing these short strands
from being joined together into longer strands. Joining nucleotides
together requires the creation of phosphodiester bonds, so if enzymes
that created these bonds (ligases)
