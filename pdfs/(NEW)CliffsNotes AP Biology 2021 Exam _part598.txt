of the meiotic cell divisions that produce eggs in females (oogenesis) and sperm in males
(spermatogenesis).
Oogenesis begins during embryonic development. Fetal cells called oogonia divide by mitosis to produce primary
oocytes, which then begin meiosis. All primary oocytes, however, progress only to prophase I. They remain at this
stage until puberty, at which time one primary oocyte during each menstrual cycle (averaging 28 days) continues its
development through the remainder of meiosis I. Development occurs within an envelope of encircling cells called a
follicle, which protects and nourishes the developing oocyte. During the remainder of meiosis I, cytoplasm is
concentrated in only one of the daughter cells (unequal cytokinesis). Thus, at the end of meiosis I, one daughter cell
is the secondary oocyte containing most of the cytoplasm, and the other daughter cell is a polar body with very
little cytoplasm. The polar body may continue with meiosis II and divide into two daughter pol
