abstract concept, we may need to quantize 
factors of different levels of the sustainable development, so we list out the main 
factors and search for the data to support the body of the analytic hierarchy process. 
Then we make the following assumptions: 
 The sustainable development is mainly determined by three factors: the society, 
the economy and the ecology, and other factors nearly can be neglected. 
 All the statistical datum are convincible and can show the characters of the total. 
 A statistical data won’t fluctuate greatly if nothing unexpected happens. 
 The set of the weight is comparatively objective and follow most people’s willing 
and ideas.

We set the target layer as ‘A-Sustainability’. Then we set the first criteria layer as 
‘B1-Society’, ‘B2-Economy’ and ‘B3-Ecology’. Moreover, we set the secondary 
criteria layer as ‘C11-Population’, ‘C12-Policy’, ‘C13-Community stability’, 
‘C14-Public health’, ‘C15-Education’, ‘C21-Technology’,
