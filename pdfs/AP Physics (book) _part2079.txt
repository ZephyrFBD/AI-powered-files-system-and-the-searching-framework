ify the unknowns. We have three unknowns 
and therefore
we need three equations, which we get by applying Kirchhoff’s junction and
loop rules.
3. Junction rule: We apply Kirchhoff’s junction rule to the currents at point a,
where 
enters and 
and 
leave:
(i)
This same equation holds at point d, so we get no new information by writing
an equation for point d.

4. Loop rule: We apply Kirchhoff’s loop rule to two different closed loops. First
we apply it to the upper loop ahdcba. We start (and end) at point a. From 
a to h we have a potential decrease
From h to d there is no
change, but from d to c the potential i
