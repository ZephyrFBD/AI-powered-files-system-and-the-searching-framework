teins may be specific 
 
1 point — process may require direct input of energy (e.g., use of ATP) 
 
1 point — description of transport mechanisms (bind molecule, conformational change, release molecule) or 
description of how proteins form channels and move molecules through them 
 
Elaboration — 1 point 
• 
description of a specific transport system (e.g., ATP synthase, Na+/K+ pump, receptor mediated 
endocytosis) 
• 
description of chemiosmosis 
• 
more than one molecule transported (e.g., symport, antiport) 
• 
may be regulated by electrical or chemical stimuli (gated channels)
