eel of Fig. 8–1,
and that the centers of these circles all lie on one line called the axis of rotation.
In Fig. 8–1 the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the page and passes through
point O.
Every point in an object rotating about a fixed axis moves in a circle (shown
dashed in Fig. 8–1 for point P) whose center is on the axis of rotation and whose
radius is r, the distance of that point from the axis of rotation. A straight line
drawn from the axis to any point in the object sweeps out the same angle in the
same time interval.
To indicate the angular position of a rotating object, or how far it has rotated,
we specify the angle of some particular line in the object (red in Fig. 8–1) with
respect to a reference line, such as the x axis in Fig. 8–1. A point in the object,
such as P in Fig. 8–1, moves through an angle 
when it travels the distance 
measured along the circumference of its circular path. Angles are commonly
measured in degrees, but the mathematics of circular motion is
