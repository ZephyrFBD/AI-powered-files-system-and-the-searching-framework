(e) Predict Zeff for the outermost electrons in the Rb atom 
based on the calculations for Na and K.
 7.16  Detailed calculations show that the value of Zeff for the outer-
most electrons in Si and Cl atoms is 4.29+ and 6.12+, respec-
tively. (a) What value do you estimate for Zeff experienced by 
the outermost electron in both Si and Cl by assuming core 
electrons contribute 1.00 and valence electrons contribute 
0.00 to the screening constant? (b) What values do you esti-
mate for Zeff using Slaterâ€™s rules? (c) Which approach gives a 
more accurate estimate of Zeff? (d) Which method of approx-
imation more accurately accounts for the steady increase in 
Zeff that occurs upon moving left to right across a period? 
 
(e) Predict Zeff for a valence electron in P
, phosphorus, based 
on the calculations for Si and Cl.
 7.17  Which will experience the greater effective nuclear charge, 
the electrons in the n = 3 shell in Ar or the n = 3 shell in Kr? 
Which will be closer to the
