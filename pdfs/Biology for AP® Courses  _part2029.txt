 These two related frog species exhibit temporal reproductive isolation. (a) Rana aurora breeds earlier in
the year than (b) Rana boylii. (credit a: modification of work by Mark R. Jennings, USFWS; credit b: modification of

In some cases, populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer
overlaps with the other populations of the same species. This situation is called habitat isolation. Reproduction with the
parent species ceases, and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent. For example, a cricket
population that was divided after a flood could no longer interact with each other. Over time, the forces of natural selection,
mutation, and genetic drift will likely result in the divergence of the two groups (Figure 18.20).
Figure 18.20 Speciation can occur when two populations occupy different habitats. The habitats need not be far apart.
