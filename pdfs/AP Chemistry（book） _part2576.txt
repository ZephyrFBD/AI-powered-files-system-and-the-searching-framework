tion of pH.
We can learn many things from Figure 16.14. For instance, if the 
pH is greater than 4, there is essentially no H3PO4 left in solution. At 
pH 7 14, the major component is the phosphate ion, PO4
3-. We can

CHAPTER 16 Acid–Base Equilibria
16.7 ∣ Weak Bases
Many substances behave as weak bases in water. Weak bases react with water, abstracting 
protons from H2O, thereby forming the conjugate acid of the base and OH- ions:
 
B1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ HB+1aq2 + OH -1aq2 
[16.33]
The equilibrium-constant expression for this reaction can be written as
 
Kb =
3BH+43OH-4
3B4
 
[16.34]
Water is the solvent, so it is omitted from the equilibrium-constant expression. One of 
the most commonly encountered weak bases is ammonia, NH3:
 
NH31aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ NH4
+1aq2 + OH-1aq2 Kb =
3NH4
+43OH -4
3NH34
