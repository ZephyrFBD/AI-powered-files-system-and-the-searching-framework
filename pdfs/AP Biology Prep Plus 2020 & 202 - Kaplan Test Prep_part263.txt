e tracheophytes, which have
vascular tissue, two of the important modern phyla are the
gymnosperms and the angiosperms. The gymnosperms, such as the
conifers, have “naked seeds” that do not have endosperm and are not
located in true fruits. The angiosperms are the flowering plants. They
have flowers, true fruits, and a double fertilization system that creates
endosperm to nourish the plant embryo. Angiosperms are the most
successful form of plant life on the planet, and the following diagram
distinguishes between two main classes of angiosperm: monocots and
dicots.
Monocots vs. Dicots: Two Angiosperm Classes
Common in flowering plants, polyploidy drives adaptation and
speciation. Most eukaryotes are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes
(2N). Polyploids have three or more times the haploid (N) chromosome
number. For example, triploids (3N) have three sets of chromosomes,
tetraploids (4N) have four sets of chromosomes, and hexaploids (6N)
have six sets of chromosomes. Polyploids occur
