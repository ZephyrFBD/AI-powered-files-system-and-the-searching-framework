ing the patterns and trends that might 
make the data meaningful for the researcher 
and possibly lead to the discovery of new 
information or the development of new 
concepts. Comparing patterns and trends 
in data helps students describe biological 
changes that occur over time, predict 
short-term and long-term changes, and 
draw conclusions about the causes and/or 
solutions to problems in biological systems.
Students also need to calculate genotypic 
and/or phenotypic ratios. Be sure students 
understand the difference in these two types 
of ratios, as confusion between them is a 
common student error on the exam. 
Additionally, students should expect to 
calculate a chi-square value and explain the 
meaning in context of a given scenario. On 
the exam, students commonly fail to identify 
the null hypothesis rather than an alternate 
hypothesis; thus, they will need multiple and 
varied opportunities to practice this skill.
