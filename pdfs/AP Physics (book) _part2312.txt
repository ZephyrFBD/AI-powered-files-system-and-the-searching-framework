Pulling a coil from a magnetic field. A 100-loop square
coil of wire, with side
and total resistance
is positioned
perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field 
as shown in Fig. 21–9.
It is quickly pulled from the field at constant speed (moving perpendicular to )
to a region where B drops abruptly to zero. At
the right edge of the coil is
at the edge of the field. It takes 0.100 s for the whole coil to reach the field-free
region. Determine (a) the rate of change in flux through one loop of the coil,
and (b) the total emf and current induced in the 100-loop coil. (c) How much
energy is dissipated in the coil? (d) What was the average force required 
APPROACH We start by finding how the magnetic flux,
