s in allele frequencies in a population. If a 
population is not in H-W equilibrium, then something else is happening that is making 
the allele frequencies change. 
What factors can cause allele frequencies to change in a population? (Hint: There are 
many.) How could you model these factors using your spreadsheet? 
■ Designing and Conducting Your Investigation 
By this point you’ve been able to use your model to explore how random chance affects 
the inheritance patterns of alleles in large and small populations. Perhaps you’ve also 
been able to find some interesting patterns in how alleles behave across generations. 
At the end of the last section you were asked what factors can cause allele frequencies 
to change in a population and how you would model them. Choose one of your answers, 
and try it out using your spreadsheet. This may involve adding multiple columns or rows 
along with a few extra operations. Keep the life cycle of your hypothetical population in 
mind as you devel
