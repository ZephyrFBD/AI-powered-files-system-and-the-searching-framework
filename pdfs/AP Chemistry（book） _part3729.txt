also âˆ†. Thus, the goal 
of filling lowest-energy available orbitals first is met by putting the electron in a t2 
orbital.
There is a penalty for doing this, however, because the electron must now be paired 
with the electron already occupying the orbital. The difference between the energy 
required to pair an electron in an occupied orbital and the energy required to place that 
electron in an empty orbital is called the spin-pairing energy. The spin-pairing energy 
arises from the fact that the electrostatic repulsion between two electrons that share an 
orbital (and so must have opposite spins) is greater than the repulsion between two elec-
trons that are in different orbitals and have parallel spins.
In coordination complexes, the nature of the ligands and the charge on the metal 
ion often play major roles in determining which of the two electron arrangements shown 
in Figure 23.31 is used. In 3CoF643 -  and 3Co(CN)643 -, both ligands have a 1- charge. 
The F- ion, however, is on
