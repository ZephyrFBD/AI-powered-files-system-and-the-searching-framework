, the anterior 
daughter cell gives rise to muscle and gonads  
and the posterior daughter cell gives rise to the 
intestine. However, if the cells of the embryo  
are separated from one another early during the 
four-cell stage, no intestine will form. Other 
experiments have shown that if cell 3 and cell 4 
are recombined after the initial separation, the 
posterior daughter cell of cell 3 will once again 
give rise to normal intestine. Which of the 
following is the most plausible explanation for 
these findings? 
(A) A cell surface protein on cell 4 signals cell 3 
to induce formation of the wormâ€™s intestine. 
(B) The plasma membrane of cell 4 interacts with 
the plasma membrane of the posterior 
portion of cell 3, causing invaginations that 
become microvilli. 
(C) Cell 3 passes an electrical signal to cell 4, 
which induces differentiation in cell 4. 
(D) Cell 4 transfers genetic material to cell 3, 
which directs the development of intestinal 
cells.
