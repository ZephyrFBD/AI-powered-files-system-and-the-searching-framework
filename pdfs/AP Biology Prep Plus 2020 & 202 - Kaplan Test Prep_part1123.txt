 original population. This lack of genetic variety has severely limited
the devils’ immune system in recognizing and fighting oﬀ pathogens.
Today’s devil population has been decimated by devil facial tumor
disease, DFTD, an aggressive non-viral transmissible cancer. However, a
group of devils from Northwest Tasmania seems to be resistant to DFTD.
Which of the following statements regarding the various processes of
selection would help the Tasmanian devil evade extinction?
Stabilizing selection will cause the frequency of the allele for DFTD
resistance to remain constant in successive generations of devils.
(A)
Disruptive selection will cause the frequency of the allele for DFTD
resistance to decrease in successive generations of devils.
(B)
Directional selection will cause the frequency of the allele for DFTD
resistance to increase in successive generations of devils.
(C)
Directional selection will cause the frequency of the allele for DFTD
resistance to decrease in successive generati
