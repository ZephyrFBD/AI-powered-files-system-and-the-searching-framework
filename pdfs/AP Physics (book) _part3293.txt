and p-type layers in the earliest useful OLED. Polymers, long organic molecules
with repeating structural units, can also be used for an OLED.
The simplest OLED consists of two organic layers, the emissive layer and the
conductive layer, each 20 to 50 nm thick, sandwiched between two electrodes,
Fig. 29–38. The anode is typically transparent, to let the light out. It can be made
of a very thin layer of indium–tin oxide (ITO), which is transparent and conduc-
tive, coated on a glass slab. The cathode is often metallic, but could also be made
of transparent material.

OLEDs can be smaller and thinner than ordinary inorganic LEDs. They can
be more easily constructed as a unit for a screen display (i.e., more cheaply, but
still quite expensive) than for inorganic LEDs. Their use as screens on cell
phones, cameras, and TVs produces brighter light and greater contrast, and they
need less power (important for battery life of portable devices) than LCD screens.
Why? They need no backlight
