iving systems require free energy and matter from the
environment to grow, reproduce, and maintain homeostasis.
Organisms survive by coupling chemical reactions that
increase entropy with those that decrease entropy.

The water molecule’s polar nature leads to surface tension
(enabling capillary action) and makes it an eﬀective solvent. It
expands rather than contracts when it freezes. These
properties make water essential to life on Earth.

The four most common types of biological molecules are
carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Carbs,
proteins, and nucleic acids include polymers composed of
simpler monomer subunits, which give the molecules their
distinctive properties: monosaccharides make up
disaccharides and polysaccharides, amino acids make up
monopeptides and polypeptides, and nucleotides make up
RNA and DNA. Lipids are not technically polymers, but some of
them are composed of smaller molecules: triglycerides (fats

and oils) contain glycerol and three fa
