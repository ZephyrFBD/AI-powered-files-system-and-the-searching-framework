pairing-up process is important. By aligning and binding the homologues
together, accurate crossing-over is likely to occur. Crossing-over is the
process by which nonsister chromatids exchange genetic material. It
results in the recombination of genetic material. While crossing-over is
occurring, what is visible under a microscope are chiasmata (chiasma,
singular), Xs on the chromosome where homologous bits of DNA are
switching places. Crossing-over is a highly organized mechanism to
ensure greater variation among gametes.

Be able to represent the connection between meiosis and increased genetic diversity
necessary for evolution.
Meiosis II is like mitosis. In this process, sister chromatids separate
into different cells. The two stages of meiosis are further divided into
phases. Each meiotic cell division consists of the same four stages as
mitosis: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
