 1.80  Two spheres of equal volume are placed on the scales as 
shown. Which one is more dense?
 1.81  Water has a density of 0.997 g>cm3 at 25 °C; ice has a density 
of 0.917 g>cm3 at -10 °C. (a) If a soft-drink bottle whose vol-
ume is 1.50 L is completely filled with water and then frozen 
to -10 °C, what volume does the ice occupy? (b) Can the ice 
be contained within the bottle?
 1.82  A 32.65-g sample of a solid is placed in a flask. Toluene, in 
which the solid is insoluble, is added to the flask so that the 
total volume of solid and liquid together is 50.00 mL. The 
solid and toluene together weigh 58.58 g. The density of tol-
uene at the temperature of the experiment is 0.864 g>mL. 
What is the density of the solid?
 1.83  A thief plans to steal a gold sphere with a radius of 28.9 cm 
from a museum. If the gold has a density of 19.3 g>cm3, what 
is the mass of the sphere in pounds? [The volume of a sphere 
is V = 14>32pr3.4 Is the thief likely to be able to walk
