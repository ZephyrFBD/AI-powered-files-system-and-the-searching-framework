gh elevations, because the boiling water is cooking at a lower
temperature. Pressure cookers reduce cooking time because they build up a 
pressure as high as 2 atm, allowing a higher boiling (and cooking) temperature to
be attained (Problem 64 and Fig. 13–32).
Partial Pressure and Humidity
When we refer to the weather as being dry or humid, we are referring to the
water vapor content of the air. In a gas such as air, which is a mixture of several
types of gases, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas
present.† By partial pressure, we mean the pressure each gas would exert if it
alone were present. The partial pressure of water in the air can be as low as zero
and can vary up to a maximum equal to the saturated vapor pressure of water at
the given temperature. Thus, at 20°C, the partial pressure of water cannot exceed
17.5 torr (see Table 13–3) or about 0.02 atm. The relative humidity is defined as
the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor to the satur
