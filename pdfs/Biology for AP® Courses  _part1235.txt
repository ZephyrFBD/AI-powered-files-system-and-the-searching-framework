 of two nuclear divisions resulting in four nuclei that are
usually partitioned into four new cells. The nuclei resulting from meiosis are not genetically identical and they contain one
chromosome set only. This is half the number of chromosome sets in the original cell, which is diploid.

The main differences between mitosis and meiosis occur in meiosis I, which is a very different nuclear division than
mitosis. In meiosis I, the homologous chromosome pairs become associated with each other, are bound together with
the synaptonemal complex, develop chiasmata and undergo crossover between sister chromatids, and line up along the
metaphase plate in tetrads with kinetochore fibers from opposite spindle poles attached to each kinetochore of a homolog in
a tetrad. All of these events occur only in meiosis I.
When the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs moving to one pole or another, the ploidy
levelâ€”the number of s
