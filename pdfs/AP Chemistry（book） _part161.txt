Derived SI Units
The SI base units are used to formulate derived units. A derived unit is obtained by multipli-
cation or division of one or more of the base units. We begin with the defining equation for 
a quantity and, then substitute the appropriate base units. For example, speed is defined as 
the ratio of distance traveled to elapsed time. Thus, the derived SI unit for speed is the SI unit 
for distance (length), m, divided by the SI unit for time, s, which gives m/s, read “meters per 
second.” Two common derived units in chemistry are those for volume and density.
Volume
The volume of a cube is its length cubed, length3. Thus, the derived SI unit of volume is 
the SI unit of length, m, raised to the third power. The cubic meter, m3, is the volume of a 
cube that is 1 m on each edge (Figure 1.20). Smaller units, such as cubic centimeters, cm3 
(sometimes written cc), are frequently used in chemistry. Another volume unit used in
