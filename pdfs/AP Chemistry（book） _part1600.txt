00 g of O21g2 and 9.00 g of CH41g2 is placed in a 15.0-L vessel at 0 °C. What is the partial pressure of each 
gas, and what is the total pressure in the vessel?
According to Dalton’s law of partial pressures (Equation 10.12), 
the total pressure in the vessel is the sum of the partial pressures:
P
t = P
O2 + P
CH4
= 0.281 atm + 0.841 atm = 1.122 atm
Check A pressure of roughly 1 atm seems right for a mixture of 
about 0.2 mol O2 and a bit more than 0.5 mol CH4, together in a 
15-L volume, because 1 mol of an ideal gas at 1 atm pressure and 
0 °C occupies about 22 L.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
A 15-L cylinder contains 4.0 g of hydrogen and 28 g of  
nitrogen. If the temperature is 27 °C what is the total pressure  
of the mixture? 
(a) 0.44 atm (b) 1.6 atm (c) 3.3 atm  
(d) 4.9 atm (e) 9.8 atm
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
What is the total pressure exerted by a mixture of 2.00 g of 
H21g2 and 8.00 g of N21g2 at 273 K in a 10.0-L vessel?
