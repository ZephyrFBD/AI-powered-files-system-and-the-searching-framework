s “contact forces,” such as your hands
pushing or pulling a cart, or a tennis racket hitting a tennis ball.
In contrast, both the gravitational force and the electrical force act over a dis-
tance: there is a force between two objects even when the objects are not touching.
The idea of a force acting at a distance was a difficult one for early thinkers.
Newton himself felt uneasy with this idea when he published his law of universal
gravitation. A helpful way to look at the situation uses the idea of the field, devel-
oped by the British scientist Michael Faraday (1791–1867). In the electrical case,
according to Faraday, an electric field extends outward from every charge and
permeates all of space (Fig. 16–22). If a second charge (call it 
) is placed near
the first charge, it feels a force exerted by the electric field that is there (say, at
point P in Fig. 16–22). The electric field at point P is considered to interact directly
with charge 
to produce the force on
