which they are in contact. The gas in an 
inflated balloon, for example, exerts a pressure on the inside surface of the balloon.
Atmospheric Pressure and the Barometer
People, coconuts, and nitrogen molecules all experience an attractive gravitational force 
that pulls them toward the center of the Earth. When a coconut comes loose from a tree, 
for example, this force causes the coconut to be accelerated toward Earth, its speed increas-
ing as its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. 
 (Section 1.4) The gas atoms 
and molecules of the atmosphere also experience a gravitational acceleration.  
Because 
these particles have such tiny masses, however, their thermal energies of motion (their 
kinetic energies) override the gravitational forces, so the particles that make up the atmo-
sphere don’t pile up at the Earth’s surface. Nevertheless, the gravitational force does oper-
ate, and it causes the atmosphere as a whole to press down on the Earth’s surface, creating
