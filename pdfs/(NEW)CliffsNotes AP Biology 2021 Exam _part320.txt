entary DNA are called
Okazaki fragments. The Okazaki fragments are connected by DNA ligase, producing a single complementary
strand. Because this complementary strand requires more time to assemble than the leading strand, it is called the
lagging strand.
DNA polymerase is able to attach nucleotides only to an already existing complementary strand. Therefore, to
initiate a new complementary strand, another enzyme, primase, begins replication with a short segment of RNA
(not DNA) nucleotides, called an RNA primer. The leading strand and every Okazaki fragment on the lagging
strand must begin with an RNA primer. When the primer is in place, DNA polymerase can attach succeeding DNA
nucleotides to the primer. The RNA nucleotides of the RNA primer are later replaced with DNA nucleotides by
DNA polymerase.
Figure 9-2 illustrates the growth of leading and lagging DNA complements. In the figure, the RNA primer that
initiated the leading strand is not shown because it was replaced with DNA nucl
