ey may originate from other living things. The actions or reactions of living things to these stimuli are called
behaviors. The behaviors may be encoded in DNA or they may be learned; they may be individual behaviors or they
may be group behaviors, behaviors coordinated in concert with other individuals.
Kinds of Animal Behavior
Animal behavior can be inherited through genes (innate behavior) or it can be learned through interactions with the
environment. Behavior that is influenced by genes is molded by natural selection and other evolutionary forces. As a
result, genetically based behaviors should increase the fitness, or reproductive success, of the individual. Behaviors
are categorized as follows:
1. Instinct is behavior that is innate, or inherited.
In mammals, care for offspring by female parents is innate.
2. Fixed action patterns (FAPs) are innate behaviors that follow a regular, unvarying pattern. An FAP is initiated
by a specific stimulus. Typically, the behavior is carried o
