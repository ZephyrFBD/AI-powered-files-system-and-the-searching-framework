apid carbon exchange among
living organisms and the other dealing with the long-term cycling of carbon through geologic processes. The entire carbon
cycle is shown in Figure 37.16.
Figure 37.16 Carbon dioxide gas exists in the atmosphere and is dissolved in water. Photosynthesis converts carbon
dioxide gas to organic carbon, and respiration cycles the organic carbon back into carbon dioxide gas. Long-term
storage of organic carbon occurs when matter from living organisms is buried deep underground and becomes
fossilized. Volcanic activity and, more recently, human emissions, bring this stored carbon back into the carbon cycle.
