If the pure water in the left arm of the U-tube is replaced by a solution 
more concentrated than the one in the right arm, what will happen?

Solution
Initially
At equilibrium
Pressure applied 
to equalize fluid 
levels in both arms 
equals osmotic 
pressure, ∏. 
Net movement of H2O is 
from pure water side to 
solution side.
At equilibrium, the flow of H2O is the 
same in both directions, so there is 
no net movement of H2O.
      
▲ Figure 13.22 Osmosis is the process of a solvent moving from one compartment to another, across  
a semipermeable membrane, toward higher solute concentration. Osmotic pressure is generated at  
equilibrium due to the different heights of liquid on either side of the membrane and is equivalent  
to the pressure needed to equalize the fluid levels across the membrane.
