(b) 0.85c to 0.98c?
26â€“9 E=mc2; Mass and Energy
21. (I) Calculate the rest energy of an electron in joules and in
MeV
22. (I) When a uranium nucleus at rest breaks apart in the
process known as fission in a nuclear reactor, the resulting
fragments have a total kinetic energy of about 200 MeV.
How much mass was lost in the process?
23. (I) The total annual energy consumption in the United
States is about 
How much mass would have to
be converted to energy to fuel this need?
24. (I) Calculate the mass of a proton 
in
25. (I) A certain chemical reaction requires 
of
energy input for it to go. What is the increase in mass of
the products over the reactants?
26. (II) Calculate the kinetic energy and momentum of a
proton traveling 
27. (II) What is the momentum of a 950-MeV proton (that is,
its kinetic energy is 950 MeV)?
28. (II) What is the speed of an electron whose kinetic energy
is 1.12 MeV?
29. (II) (a) How much work is required to accelerate a proton
from rest up to a speed of 0.985c?
