rike other nuclei and cause additional fission. The amount 
of fissionable material large enough to maintain a chain reaction with a constant rate 
of fission is called the critical mass. When a critical mass of material is present, one 
neutron on average from each fission is subsequently effective in producing another 
fission and the fission continues at a constant, controllable rate. The critical mass of 
 
uranium-235 is about 50 kg for a bare sphere of the metal.*
If more than a critical mass of fissionable material is present, very few neutrons 
escape. The chain reaction thus multiplies the number of fissions, which can lead to a 
nuclear explosion. A mass in excess of a critical mass is referred to as a supercritical 
mass. The effect of mass on a fission reaction is illustrated in Figure 21.16.
*The exact value of the critical mass depends on the shape of the radioactive substance. The critical 
mass can be reduced if the radioisotope is surrounded by a material that reflects
