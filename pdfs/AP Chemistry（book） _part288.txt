mass differences
▲ Figure 2.11 A mass spectrometer. Cl atoms are first ionized to form Cl+ ions, 
accelerated with an electric field, and finally their path is directed by a magnetic field. 
The paths of the ions of the two Cl isotopes diverge as they pass through the field.

▲ Figure 2.12 Mass spectrum of atomic chlorine. The 
fractional abundances of the isotopes 35Cl and 37Cl are 
indicated by the relative signal intensities of the beams 
reaching the detector of the mass spectrometer.
The most accurate means for determining atomic weights is pro-
vided by the mass spectrometer (Figure 2.11). There are various 
designs of mass spectrometers, but they all operate on similar prin-
ciples. The first step is to get atoms or molecules into the gas phase. 
Sometimes the sample to be analyzed is already a gas, whereas in 
other cases heating, application of an electric field, or a pulse of 
laser light m
