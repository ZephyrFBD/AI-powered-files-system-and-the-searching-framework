Question 5
Figure 1. Blood lactate levels during underwater dives 
Many aquatic animals can hold their breath and dive underwater for long periods of time. During long 
dives, lactic acid builds up in tissues of the organism. The graph above shows blood lactate levels 
following dives of different duration for three species. Lactate is produced when lactic acid is dissolved in 
the blood and becomes ionized. 
(a) Based on the data, propose a hypothesis to explain the change in blood lactate levels in Weddell seals 
for dives lasting longer than 20 minutes. 
Proposal (1 point) 
Increase in lactate levels are due to fermentation/anaerobic metabolism 
(b) Describe the mos
