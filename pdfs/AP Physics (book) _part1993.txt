eir basic aspects here.
The voltage produced by an ac electric generator is sinusoidal, as we shall see
later. The current it produces is thus sinusoidal (Fig. 18–21b). We can write the
voltage as a function of time as
(18;7a)
The potential V oscillates between 
and 
and 
is referred to as the peak
voltage. The frequency f is the number of complete oscillations made per second,
and
In most areas of the United States and Canada, f is 60 Hz (the
unit “hertz,” as we saw in Chapters 8 and 11, means cycles per second). In many
countries, 50 Hz is used.
Equation 18–2,
works also for ac: if a voltage V exists across a resis-
tance R, then the current I through the resistance is
(18;7b)
The quantity 
is the peak current. The current is considered posi-
tive when the electrons flow in one direction and negative when they flow in the
opposite direction. It is clear from Fig. 18–21b that an alternating current is as
often positive as it is negative. Thus, the average current is zero. This does no
