ar hydrides (formed by nonmetals). 
The ionic hydrides contain the H - ion; because this ion is extremely 
basic, ionic hydrides react with H2O to form H2 and OH -.
GROUP 8A: THE NOBLE GASES AND GROUP 7A: HALOGENS 
(SECTIONS 22.3 AND 22.4) The noble gases (group 8A) exhibit a 
very limited chemical reactivity because of the exceptional stability 
of their electron configurations. The xenon fluorides and oxides and 
KrF2 are the best-established compounds of the noble gases.
The halogens (group 7A) occur as diatomic molecules. All except 
fluorine exhibit oxidation states varying from -1 to +7. Fluorine is 
the most electronegative element, so it is restricted to the oxidation 
states 0 and -1. The oxidizing power of the element (the tendency 
to form the -1 oxidation state) decreases as we proceed down the 
group.
The hydrogen halides are among the most useful compounds of 
these elements; these gases dissolve in water to form the hydrohalic 
acids, such as HCl(aq). Hydrofluoric acid r
