nd nonbonding pairs of electrons, also called lone 
pairs, both create electron domains around an atom. Accord-
ing to the VSEPR model, electron domains orient themselves to 
radiant energy. Scientists are working to make solar cells in which 
TiO2 is mixed with highly colored molecules, whose HOMO–
LUMO gaps correspond to visible and near-infrared light to absorb 
more of the solar spectrum. If the HOMO of these molecules is 
higher in energy than the HOMO of TiO2, the excited electrons will 
flow from the molecules into the TiO2, thereby generating electric-
ity when the device is illuminated with light and connected to an 
external circuit.
Efficient solar energy conversion promises to be one of the most 
interesting and important areas of both scientific and technologi-
cal development in our future. Many of you may ultimately end up 
working in fields that have an impact on the world’s energy portfolio.
