 enclosure of 0.452 L has a partial 
pressure of O2 of 3.5 * 10-6 torr at 27 °C, what mass of mag-
nesium will react according to the following equation?
 
 
2 Mg1s2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 MgO1s2
 10.56  Calcium hydride, CaH2, reacts with water to form hydrogen 
gas:
 
 
CaH21s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡ Ca1OH221aq2 + 2 H21g2
 
 This reaction is sometimes used to inflate life rafts, weather 
balloons, and the like, when a simple, compact means of 
generating H2 is desired. How many grams of CaH2 are 
needed to generate 145 L of H2 gas if the pressure of H2 is 
825 torr at 21 °C?
 10.57 The metabolic oxidation of glucose, C6H12O6, in our bodies 
produces CO2, which is expelled from our lungs as a gas:
 
 
C6H12O61aq2 + 6 O21g2 ¡ 6 CO21g2 + 6 H2O1l2
 
 (a) Calculate the volume of dry CO2 produced at body 
temperature 137 °C2 and 0.970 atm when 24.5 g of glucose 
is consumed in this reaction. (b) Calculate the volume of 
oxygen you would need, at 1.00 atm and 298 K, to completely 
oxidize 50.0 g of glucose.
