’s Law
As Figure 10.6 illustrates, the volume of an inflated balloon increases when the tempera-
ture of the gas inside the balloon increases and decreases when the temperature of the 
gas decreases. This relationship between gas volume and temperature was discovered in 
1787 by French scientist Jacques Charles (1746–1823). Some typical volume–temperature 
data are shown in Figure 10.7. Notice that the extrapolated (dashed) line passes through 
-273 °C. Note also that the gas is predicted to have zero volume at this temperature. This 
condition is never realized, however, because all gases liquefy or solidify before reaching 
this temperature.
In 1848, William Thomson (1824–1907), a British physicist whose title was Lord 
Kelvin, proposed an absolute-temperature scale, now known as the Kelvin scale. On this 
scale, 0 K, called absolute zero, equals -273.15 °C.  
 (Section 1.5) In terms of the Kelvin 
scale, Charles’s law states:
The volume of a fixed amount of gas maintained at constan
