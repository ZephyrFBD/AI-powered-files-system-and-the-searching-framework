BbVv and ½bbvv (Figure 8-6). If this cross were actually carried out, however, the results would produce a ratio
among the four offspring BbVv:bbvv:Bbvv:bbVv closer to 41:41:9:9. This is because linked genes cross over
(recombine) during prophase I—in this case, about 18% of the time. Instead of 50% of the gametes being BV and
50% bv, an 18% crossover rate would produce 41% BV and 41% bv (which sum to 82%) and 9% Bv and 9% bV
(which sum to 18%) (Figure 8-6).

The greater the distance between two genes on a chromosome, the more places between the genes that the
chromosome can break and thus the more likely the two genes will cross over during synapsis. As a result,
recombination frequencies are used to give a picture of the arrangement of genes on a chromosome. Suppose you
knew that for a fly with genotype BBVVAA (where A is the apterous, or wingless, mutant) the crossover frequency
between B and V was 18%, between A and V was 12%, and between B and A was6%. Since greater reco
