ing an action potential
(C) The sodium-potassium pump, which restores resting membrane potentials in neurons through the use of
ATP
(D) Osmosis of water into an epithelial cell lining the lumen of the small intestine
2. The development of electron microscopy has provided key insights into many aspects of cellular structure and
function, which had previously been too small to be seen. All of the following would require the use of
electron microscopy for visualization EXCEPT
(A) the structure of a bacteriophage
(B) the matrix structure of a mitochondrion
(C) the shape and arrangement of bacterial cells
(D) the pores on the nuclear membrane
3. Vibrio cholerae (shown below) are highly pathogenic bacteria that are associated with severe gastrointestinal
illness and are the causative agent of cholera. In extreme cases, antibiotics are prescribed that target bacterial
structures that are absent in animal cells. Which of the following structures is most likely targeted by antibiotic
treatment?
