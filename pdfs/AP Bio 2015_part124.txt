Identification (1 point)  
Peak membrane permeability to Na+ precedes that of K+
•
Changes in membrane permeability to Na+ are more rapid than those of K+
•
Changes in membrane permeability to Na+ are of greater magnitude than those of K+
(b) Describe ONE structural feature of the plasma membrane of the motor neuron that regulates the 
permeability of the plasma membrane to Na+ and K+ during an action potential. 
Description (1 point)
(Voltage-)
•
 Gated channels regulate Na+ and K+ movements across membranes 
•
Phospholipid bilayer prevents unregulated diffusion of Na+/K+ across membranes 
•
Na+/K+ pumps maintain membrane potential
(c) Connect the relative membrane permeability data shown in Figure 1 with the changes in membrane 
potential during stages II and III of the action potential shown in Figure 2.
