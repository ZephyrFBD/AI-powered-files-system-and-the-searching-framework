 × tt. Let’s take a look.
If none of the offspring is short, our original plant must have been homozygous, TT. If, however, even one short
plant appears in the bunch, we know that our original pea plant was heterozygous, Tt. In other words, it wasn’t a
pure-breeding plant. Overall then, a test cross uses a recessive organism to determine the genotype of an organism of
unknown genotype.
Linked Genes
Sometimes genes on the same chromosome stay together during assortment and move as a group. The group of
genes is considered linked and tends to be inherited together. For example, the genes for flower color and pollen
shape are linked on the same chromosomes and show up together.
Since linked genes are found on the same chromosome, they cannot segregate independently. This violates the Law
of Independent Assortment.
Let’s pretend that the height and color genes we looked at in the dihybrid cross are linked. A heterozygote for both
traits still has two alleles for height (T and t) and two al
