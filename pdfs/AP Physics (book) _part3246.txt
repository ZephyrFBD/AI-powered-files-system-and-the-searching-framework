 already connected in Fig. 29–13, top right, and a fifth is about to be
connected), the old t-RNA molecule is removed—perhaps by a random collision
with some molecule in the cellular fluid. A new one soon becomes attracted as
the ribosome moves along the m-RNA.
This process of protein synthesis is often presented as if it occurred in clock-
work fashion—as if each molecule knew its role and went to its assigned place.
But this is not the case. The forces of attraction between the electric charges of
the molecules are rather weak and become significant only when the molecules can
come close together, and when several weak bonds can be made. Indeed, if the
shapes are not just right, the electrostatic attraction is nearly zero, which is why
there are few mistakes. The fact that weak bonds are weak is very important. If they
were strong, collisions with other molecules would not allow a t-RNA molecule
to be released from the ribosome, or the m-RNA to be released from the DNA.
If they were
