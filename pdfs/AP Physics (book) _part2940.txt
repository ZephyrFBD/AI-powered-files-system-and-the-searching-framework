in
the CRT of an old TV set, and (b) 0.98c in an accelerator used for cancer therapy.
APPROACH We use Eq. 26–4 for the momentum of a moving electron.
SOLUTION (a) At 
the electron’s momentum is
The factor 
so the momentum is only about 1%
greater than the classical value. (If we put in the mass of an electron,
the momentum is 
compared to 
classically.)
(b) With 
the momentum is
An electron traveling at 98% the speed of light has
and a momentum
5.0 times its classical value.
