reduces osmoreceptor activity in the hypothalamus, and ADH secretion is reduced. ADH release can
be reduced by certain substances, including alcohol, which can cause increased urine production and dehydration.
Chronic underproduction of ADH or a mutation in the ADH receptor results in diabetes insipidus. If the posterior pituitary
does not release enough ADH, water cannot be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine. This causes increased thirst, but
water taken in is lost again and must be continually consumed. If the condition is not severe, dehydration may not occur,
but severe cases can lead to electrolyte imbalances due to dehydration.
Another hormone responsible for maintaining electrolyte concentrations in extracellular fluids is aldosterone, a steroid
hormone that is produced by the adrenal cortex. In contrast to ADH, which promotes the reabsorption of water to maintain
proper water balance, aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing Na+ reabsorption and K+ secr
