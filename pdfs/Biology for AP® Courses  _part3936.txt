Figure 33.14 Natural killer (NK) cells recognize the MHC I receptor on healthy cells. If MHC I is absent, the cell is
lysed.
Based on what you know about MHC receptors, why do you think an organ transplanted from an incompatible donor
to a recipient will be rejected?
a.
The natural killer cells of the recipient will recognize the MHC II proteins present on the cell surface of
incompatible organ as foreign and activate macrophages, which will phagocytose foreign cells. The attack
will cause the organ to be rejected.
b.
Neutrophils will recognize the proteins on incompatible organ as foreign and will phagocytose the foreign
cells of the incompatible organ.
c.
The natural killer cells of the recipient will recognize the MHC II proteins present on the cell surface of
incompatible organ as foreign and will attack these foreign proteins. The attack will cause the organ to be
rejected.
d.
The recipien
