use disease in humans, which may lead to more efficient treatments.
c.
Fast DNA sequencing can help doctors to treat and diagnose diseases which are not rare in populations.
d.
Faster genetic sequencing can be used to treat and prevent a few types of cancers and thus increase the life
expectancy of patients suffering from the diseases.
Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA fragments of different sizes. Usually the gel is made of a chemical
called agarose. Agarose powder is added to a buffer and heated. After cooling, the gel solution is poured into a casting tray.
Once the gel has solidified, the DNA is loaded on the gel and electric current is applied. The DNA has a net negative charge
and moves from the negative electrode toward the positive electrode. The electric current is applied for sufficient time to
let the DNA separate according to size; the smallest fragments will be farthest from the well (where the DNA was loaded),
and the heavier molecular weight fragmen
