B
The mole rats live in the same location, which means there is not a geographic barrier so (A) is incorrect. They
do not attempt to breed, so (C) and (D) are incorrect. They have formed two separate species in the same
geographic area, so (B) is correct.
7.
D
Choice (A) is incorrect because this is a small population, so genetic drift is likely. Choice (B) is incorrect
because this situation does not describe convergent evolution, and the second part of the answer choice does
not accurately describe the change of the population. Choice (D) is correct because the number of people that
are homozygous recessives will likely become fewer as the red-head allele is mixed with the more dominant
hair colors.

D
Choice (D) is the answer because it is the only choice that does not predict evolution occurring on the island,
thus supporting a claim
