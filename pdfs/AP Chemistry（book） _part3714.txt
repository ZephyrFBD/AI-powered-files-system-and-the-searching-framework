pect a solution containing this ion 
to be? (a) violet (b) blue (c) green (d) orange (e) red
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
A certain transition-metal complex ion absorbs at 695 nm. 
Which color is this ion most likely to be—blue, yellow, green, 
or red?
Give It Some Thought
What is the electron configuration for (a) the Co atom and (b) the Co3+ ion? How 
many unpaired electrons does each possess? (See Section 7.4 to review electron 
configurations of ions.)
sample can be determined using a spectrometer, as described in the “A Closer Look” 
box on page 576. The absorption spectrum of the ion 3Ti(H2O)643 +  is shown in 
 
Figure 23.26. The absorption maximum is at 500 nm, but the graph shows that much 
of the yellow, green, and blue light is absorbed. Because the sample absorbs all of these 
colors, what we see is the unabsorbed red and violet light, which we perceive as purple 
(the color purple is classified as a tertiary color located between red and violet on an 
artist’s color wheel).
