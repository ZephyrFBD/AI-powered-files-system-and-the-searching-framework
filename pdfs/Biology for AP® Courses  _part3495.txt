Pivot Joints
Pivot joints consist of the rounded end of one bone fitting into a ring formed by the other bone. This structure allows
rotational movement, as the rounded bone moves around its own axis. An example of a pivot joint is the joint of the first
and second vertebrae of the neck that allows the head to move back
