ION (a) Both weights are the same distance, 2.0 m, from the axis of rota-
tion. Thus
(b) The 5.0-kg mass is now 0.50 m from the axis, and the 7.0-kg mass is 4.50 m
from the axis. Then
NOTE This Example illustrates two important points. First, the moment of
inertia of a given system is different for different axes of rotation. Second, we
see in part (b) that mass close to the axis of rotation contributes little to the total
moment of inertia; here, the 5.0-kg object contributed less than 1% to the total.
= 1.3 kgm2 + 142 kgm2 = 143 kgm2.
I = ©mr2 = (5.0 kg)(0.50 m)2 + (7.0 kg)(4.5 m)2
= 20 kgm2 + 28 kgm2 = 48 kgm2.
I = ©mr2 = (5.0 kg)(2.0 m)2 + (7.0 kg)(2.0 m)2
