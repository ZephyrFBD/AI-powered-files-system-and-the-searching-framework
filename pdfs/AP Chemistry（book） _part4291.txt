 unpaired electrons to be weakly repelled from a magnetic 
field. (Section 9.8)
diatomic molecule A molecule composed of only two atoms. 
(Section 2.6)
diffusion The spreading of one substance throughout a space or 
throughout a second substance. (Section 10.8)
dilution The process of preparing a less concentrated solution 
from a more concentrated one by adding solvent. (Section 4.5)
dimensional analysis A method of problem solving in which 
units are multiplied together or divided into each other along 
with the numerical values. Dimensional analysis ensures that the 
final answer of a calculation has the desired units. (Section 1.7)
dipole A molecule with one end having a partial negative 
charge and the other end having a partial positive charge; a 
polar molecule. (Section 8.4)
dipole–dipole interactions A force that becomes significant 
when polar molecules come in close contact with one another. 
The force is attractive when the positive end of one polar 
molecule approaches the
