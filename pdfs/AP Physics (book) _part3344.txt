Binding energy for iron. Calculate the total binding energy
and the binding energy per nucleon for 
the most common stable isotope 
of iron.
APPROACH We subtract the mass of a 
atom from the total mass of 26 hydro-
gen atoms and 30 neutrons, all found in Appendix B. Then we convert mass units
to energy units; finally we divide by 
the total number of nucleons.
SOLUTION
has 26 protons and 30 neutrons whose separate masses are
The total binding energy is thus
and the binding energy per nucleon is
NOTE The binding energy per nucleon graph (Fig. 30â€“1) peaks about here, for
iron. So the iron nucleus, and its neighbors, are the most stable of nuclei.
EXERCISE B Determine the binding energy per nucleon for 
Binding energy of last neutron. What is the binding energy
of the last neutron in 
APPROACH If 
lost one neutron, it would be 
We subtract the mass of
from the masses of 
and a free neutron.
SOLUTION Obtaining the masses from Appendix B, we have
which in energy is 
That is, it would
