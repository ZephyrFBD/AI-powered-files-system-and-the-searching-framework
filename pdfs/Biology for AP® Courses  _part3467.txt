h and reptiles. This type of motion requires large muscles to move the limbs toward the midline;
it was almost like walking while doing push-ups, and it is not an efficient use of energy. Later tetrapods have
their limbs placed under their bodies, so that each stride requires less force to move forward. This resulted
in decreased adductor muscle size and an increased range of motion of the scapulae. This also restricts
movement primarily to one plane, creating forward motion rather than moving the limbs upward as well as
forward. The femur and humerus were also rotated, so that the ends of the limbs and digits were pointed
forward, in the direction of motion, rather than out to the side. By placement underneath the body, limbs can
swing forward like a pendulum to produce a stride that is more efficient for moving over land.
