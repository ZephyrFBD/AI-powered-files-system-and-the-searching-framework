alpha decay, actually undergoes beta emission. Furthermore, a few 
radioactive nuclei lie within the belt of stability. Both 146
60Nd and 
148
60Nd, for example, are stable and lie in the belt of stability. 147
60Nd, 
however, which lies between them, is radioactive.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of the following radioactive nuclei is most likely to 
decay via emission of a b- particle?
(a) nitrogen-13 (b) magnesium-23 (c) rubidium-83
(d) iodine-131  (e) neptunium-237
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Predict the mode of decay of (a) plutonium-239, 
(b) indium-120.
Radioactive Decay Chains
Some nuclei cannot gain stability by a single emission. Consequently, a series of 
successive emissions occurs as shown for uranium-238 in Figure 21.2. Decay con-
tinues until a stable nucleus—lead-206 in this case—is formed. A series of nuclear 
reactions that begins with an unstable nucleus and terminates with a stable one is 
known as a radioactive decay chain or a nuclear disintegration series. Three 
such
