Increased blood glucose activates the metabolism of glucose, which
leads to the generation of ATP. The binding of ATP to ligand-gated
potassium channels closes the potassium channels. This causes
depolarization of the cell. The membrane potential opens voltage-
gated calcium channels, allowing calcium to enter the cell and trigger
exocytosis of secretory vesicles containing insulin. A patient with type
2 diabetes needs more insulin to overcome insulin resistance. A drug
that closes potassium channels or opens calcium channels would
increase insulin secretion. Thus, the correct answer is (A). (B) and (D)
are incorrect because inhibiting insulin secretion and increasing
glucose levels would not overcome insulin resistance. (C) is incorrect
because closing, not opening, the potassium channel would promote
insulin secretion.
