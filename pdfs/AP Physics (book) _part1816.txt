Q1 = –32 mC
34. (II) You are given two unknown point charges,
and 
At a point on the line joining them, one-third of the way
from 
to 
the electric field is zero (Fig. 16–59). What
is the ratio Q1Q2?

35. (III) Use Coulomb’s law to determine the magnitude and
direction of the electric field at points A and B in Fig. 16–60
due to the two positive charges 
shown. Are
your results consistent with Fig. 16–32b?
(Q = 4.7 mC)
36. (III) An electron (mass 
) is acceler-
ated in the uniform field 
between
two thin parallel charged plates.
The separation of the plates is
1.60 cm.The electron is accelerated
from rest near the negative plate
and passes through a tiny hole 
in the positive plate, Fig. 16–61.
(a) With what speed does it leave
the hole? (b) Show that the 
gravitational force can be ignored.
