e each person as a point particle.
Equivalently, the location of each person is the position of that person’s own CM.
SOLUTION We use Eq. 7–9a with three terms:
The CM is 4.0 m from the left-hand end of the boat.
EXERCISE G Calculate the CM of the three people in Example 7–12, taking the origin
at the driver
on the right. Is the physical location of the CM the same?
Note that the coordinates of the CM depend on the reference frame or coordinate
system chosen. But the physical location of the CM is independent of that choice.
If the particles are spread out in two or three dimensions, then we must specify
not only the x coordinate of the CM
but also the y and z coordinates, which will
be given by formulas like Eq. 7–9a. For example, the y coordinate of the CM will be
(7;9b)
where M is the total mass of all the particles.
ycm = mAyA + mByB + p
mA + mB + p
= mAyA + mByB + p
M

xcm = mxA + mxB + mxC
m + m + m
=
