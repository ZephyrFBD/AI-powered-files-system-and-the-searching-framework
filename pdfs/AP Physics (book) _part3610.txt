which was given the name charm. The discovery in 1974 of a particle with charm
helped solidify a new theory involving quarks, which we now discuss.
32–9 Quarks
One difference between leptons and hadrons is that the hadrons interact via the
strong interaction, whereas the leptons do not. There is an even more fundamen-
tal difference. The six leptons 
are considered to be truly
fundamental particles because they do not show any internal structure, and have
no measurable size. (Attempts to determine the size of leptons have put an upper
limit of about 
) On the other hand, there are hundreds of hadrons, and
experiments indicate they do have an internal structure. When an electron
collides with another electron, it scatters off as per Coulomb’s law. But electrons
scattering off a proton reveal a more complex pattern, implying internal parts
within the proton (= quarks).
