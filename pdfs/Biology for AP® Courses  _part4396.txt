s growing much more
slowly.
A consequence of exponential human population growth is the time that it takes to add a particular number of humans to the
Earth is becoming shorter. Figure 36.16 shows that 123 years were necessary to add 1 billion humans in 1930, but it only
took 24 years to add two billion people between 1975 and 1999. As already discussed, at some point it would appear that
our ability to increase our carrying capacity indefinitely on a finite world is uncertain. Without new technological advances,
the human growth rate has been predicted to slow in the coming decades. However, the population will still be increasing
and the threat of overpopulation remains.
