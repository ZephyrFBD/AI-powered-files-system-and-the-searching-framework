trical gradient. When dealing with ions in aqueous solutions, a
combination of the electrochemical and concentration gradients, rather than just the concentration gradient alone, must be
considered. Living cells need certain substances that exist inside the cell in concentrations greater than they exist in the
extracellular space. Moving substances up their electrochemical gradients requires energy from the cell. Active transport
uses energy stored in ATP to fuel this transport. Active transport of small molecular-sized materials uses integral proteins
in the cell membrane to move the materials: These proteins are analogous to pumps. Some pumps, which carry out
primary active transport, couple directly with ATP to drive their action. In co-transport (or secondary active transport),
energy from primary transport can be used to move another substance into the cell and up its concentration gradient.
5.4 Bulk Transport
Active transport methods require the direct use of ATP to fuel the tran
