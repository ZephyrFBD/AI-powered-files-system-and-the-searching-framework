can refer to Model 3 to get 
the optimal strategy to get drugs. 
 Distribution Strategy of Vaccine 
Assume P
i as the density of population of Ai (the code of epidemic cities 
(i=1, 2, 3 …14)) (constant)  
According to the Improved ModelⅡ, we can predict the number of reduced 
susceptible people (also called the number of people who would be infected ) 
the next week. To prevent the part of people from being infected, the vaccine 
can be used. Due to the limitation of the level of production in early stage, the 
supply is supposed to be less than demand, during the time the total number of 
the vaccine distributed to Sierra Leone equals to the total output of the world 
medical association. 
With the development of the technology and equipment, the supply would 
increase. With time going by, the supply would meet the demand. From then 
on, to avoid wasting, the total output should be made according to the demand. 
So at the later stage, the number of the vaccine (later stage) is assum
