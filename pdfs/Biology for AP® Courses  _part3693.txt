nd large surface area of red blood cells allows for rapid diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the
plasma membrane. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is taken in by the blood. In the tissues, oxygen is
released from the blood and carbon dioxide is bound for transport back to the lungs. Studies have found that hemoglobin
also binds nitrous oxide (NO). NO is a vasodilator that relaxes the blood vessels and capillaries and may help with gas
exchange and the passage of red blood cells through narrow vessels. Nitroglycerin, a heart medication for angina and heart
attacks, is converted to NO to help relax the blood vessels and increase oxygen flow through the body.
A characteristic of red blood cells is their glycolipid and glycoprotein coating; these are lipids and proteins that have
carbohydrate molecules attached. In humans, the surface glycoproteins and glycolipids on red blood cells vary between
individuals, producing the different blood types, such as A, B, a
