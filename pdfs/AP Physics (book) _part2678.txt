other substance, say an oil whose
index of refraction is less than that of water (we’ll see why we assume this shortly);
see Fig. 24–30. Assume for now that the incident light is of a single wavelength.
Part of the incident light is reflected at A on the top surface, and part of the light
transmitted is reflected at B on the lower surface. The part reflected at the lower
surface must travel the extra distance ABC. If this path difference ABC equals one
or a whole number of wavelengths in the film 
the two waves will reach the
eye in phase and interfere constructively. Hence the region AC on the surface
film will appear bright. But if ABC equals
and so on, the two waves
will be exactly out of phase and destructive interference occurs: the area AC 
on the film will show no reflection—it will be dark (transparent to the dark 
material below). The wavelength 
is the wavelength in the film:
where n is the index of refraction in the film and 
is the wavelength in vacuum.
See Eq. 24–1.
