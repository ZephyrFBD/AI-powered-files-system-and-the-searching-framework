d waste through the body. Circulatory systems may be open (mixed with the interstitial fluid) or closed
(separated from the interstitial fluid). Closed circulatory systems are a characteristic of vertebrates; however, there are
significant differences in the structure of the heart and the circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due
to adaptions during evolution and associated differences in anatomy. Fish have a two-chambered heart with unidirectional
circulation. Amphibians have a three-chambered heart, which has some mixing of the blood, and they have double
circulation. Most non-avian reptiles have a three-chambered heart, but have little mixing of the blood; they have double
circulation. Mammals and birds have a four-chambered heart with no mixing of the blood and double circulation.
31.2 Components of the Blood
Specific components of the blood include red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and the plasma, which contains
coagulation factors and serum. Bl
