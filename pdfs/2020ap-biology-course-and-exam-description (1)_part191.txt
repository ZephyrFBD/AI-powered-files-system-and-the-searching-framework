By now, students should be accustomed to 
using visual models and representations to 
explain or illustrate biological processes. This 
unit provides students the opportunity to 
gain proficiency in describing a given model 
or representation and communicating the 
biological meaning it represents. Mastery 
is demonstrated when students can create 
or use models such as cladograms and 
phylogenetic trees to communicate biological 
phenomena, analyze situations, or solve 
new problems.
Hardy-Weinberg equations are used with 
respect to a specific gene. Thus, when 
teaching students how to use the e
