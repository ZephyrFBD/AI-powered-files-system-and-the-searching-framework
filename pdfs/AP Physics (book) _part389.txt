 the piano with constant speed (set 
in this equation) thus requires
a tension in the rope, and hence a pull on the rope, of
The piano
mover can exert a force equal to half the piano’s weight.
NOTE We say the pulley has given a mechanical advantage of 2, since without
the pulley the mover would have to exert twice the force.

Accelerometer. A small mass m hangs from a thin string
and can swing like a pendulum. You attach it above the window of your car 
as shown in Fig. 4–25a. When the car is at rest, the string hangs vertically.
What angle does the string make (a) when the car accelerates at a constant
and (b) when the car moves at constant velocity,
