ult of this analysis, which Galileo himself predicted, is that an object
projected horizontally will reach the ground in the same time as an object dropped
vertically. This is because the vertical motions are the same in both cases, as shown
in Fig. 3–18. Figure 3–19 is a multiple-exposure photograph of an experiment
that confirms this.

FIGURE 3;20 Path of a projectile launched with
initial velocity 
at angle 
to the horizontal.
Path is shown dashed in black, the velocity 
vectors are green arrows, and velocity 
components are dashed. The figure does 
not show where the projectile hits the ground 
(at that point, projectile motion ceases).
