TBP-AF 
1 point 
(c) 
The scientists investigated the effect of pesticides on the expression of other genes in one 
cell type of a group of bees containing males and females of the same developmental 
stage. They hypothesized that TBP-AF would serve as the best control gene for this 
experiment. Use the data to evaluate their hypothesis. 
• 
Their hypothesis is supported because TBP-AF has the smallest Cq range/most 
constant expression (when comparing sexes).

(d) 
 Explain how expression of a gene such as GAPDH can vary from one cell type to another 
within the same bee. 
• 
Different cell types contain different levels of/different transcription factors, and 
therefore regulate the expression of genes in different ways.
