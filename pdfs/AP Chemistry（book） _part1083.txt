 ion depends on its nuclear charge, the number of elec-
trons it possesses, and the orbitals in which the valence electrons reside. When a cation 
is formed from a neutral atom, electrons are removed from the occupied atomic orbit-
als that are the most spatially extended from the nucleus. Also, when a cation is formed 
the number of electron–electron repulsions is reduced. Therefore, cations are smaller than 
their parent atoms (Figure 7.8). The opposite is true of anions. When electrons are added to 
an atom to form an anion, the increased electron–electron repulsions cause the electrons 
to spread out more in space. Thus, anions are larger than their parent atoms.
Arrange Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and Ca in order of decreasing radius.
Sample Exercise 7.3 
Predicting Relative Sizes of Atomic and Ionic Radii
SOLUTION
Cations are smaller than their parent atoms, and so Ca2+ 6 Ca. 
Because Ca is below Mg in group 2A, Ca2 +  is larger than Mg2 +. 
Consequently, Ca 7 Ca2+ 7 Mg2+.
