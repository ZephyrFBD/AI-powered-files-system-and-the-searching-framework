Humoral Stimuli
The term “humoral” is derived from the term “humor,” which refers to bodily fluids such as blood. A humoral stimulus
refers to the control of hormone release in response to changes in extracellular fluids such as blood or the ion concentration
in the blood. For example, a rise in blood glucose levels triggers the pancreatic release of insulin. Insulin causes blood
glucose levels to drop, which signals the pancreas to stop producing insulin in a negative feedback loop.
