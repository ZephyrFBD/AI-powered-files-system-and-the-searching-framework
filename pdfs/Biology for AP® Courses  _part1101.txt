ally on the
underside of leaves that regulate CO2, O2, and H2O
exchange between plants and the external environment.
This interaction controls photosynthetic rate and
transpiration rate. The opening and closing of stomata are
controlled by specialized guard cells that surround the
stomatal pore. The osmotic state within the guard cells
determines their turgor; when the guard cells are flaccid,
stomata close. Turgor in the guard cells is regulated by the
active transport of several ions, including K+ and H+,
across the plasma membrane. Several environmental
factors can cause stomatal closing: water deficit, darkness,
microbes, ozone, and sulfur dioxide and other pollutants.
Intracellular carbon dioxide concentration and light can
trigger stomata to open.
The system is regulated by a phytohormone (plant
hormone) called abscisic acid (ABA) and the amino acid
precursor of the synthesis of a second phytohormone
