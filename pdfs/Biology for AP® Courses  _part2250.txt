ures are not analogous. The wings of a butterfly and the wings of a bird are analogous but not
homologous. Some structures are both analogous and homologous: the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat are both
homologous and analogous. Scientists must determine which type of similarity a feature exhibits to decipher the phylogeny
of the organisms being studied.

Figure 20.8 The (c) wing of a honeybee is similar in shape to a (b) bird wing and (a) bat wing, and it serves the same
function. However, the honeybee wing is not composed of bones and has a distinctly different structure and embryonic
origin. These wing types (insect versus bat and bird) illustrate an analogyâ€”similar structures that do not share an
evolutionary history. (credit a: modification of work by Steve Hillebrand, USFWS; credit b: modification of work by U.S.
