ELECTRON AFFINITY (SECTION 7.5) The electron affinity of 
an element is the energy change upon adding an electron to an 
atom in the gas phase, forming an anion. A negative electron af-
finity means that energy is released when the electron is added; 
hence, when the electron affinity is negative the anion is stable. 
By contrast, a positive electron affinity means that the anion is 
not stable relative to the separated atom and electron. In general, 
electron affinities become more negative as we proceed from left 
to right across the periodic table. The halogens have the most 
negative electron affinities. The electron affinities of the noble 
gases are positive because the added electron would have to oc-
cupy a new, higher-energy subshell.
METALS, NONMETALS, AND METALLOIDS (SECTION 7.6) The 
elements can be categorized as metals, nonmetals, and metalloids.
