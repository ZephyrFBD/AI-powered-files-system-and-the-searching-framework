he cell cycle. Oncogenes, then, are genes that can
convert normal cells into cancerous cells. Often these are abnormal or mutated versions of normal genes. The
normal healthy version is called a proto-oncogene.
Tumor suppressor genes produce proteins that prevent the conversion of normal cells into cancer cells. They can
detect damage to the cell and work with CDK/cyclin complexes to stop cell growth until the damage can be repaired.
They can also trigger apoptosis if the damage is too severe to be repaired.
Both oncogenes and tumor suppressors can cause cancer, but oncogenes do
it by stepping on the cell cycle gas pedal, while tumor suppressors do it by
removing the brake pedal.
Cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis have been intimately linked with cancer. In order for a normal cell to become a
cancer cell, it must override cell cycle checkpoints and grow in an unregulated way. It must also avoid cell death.
Tumors often accumulate DNA damage. Cancer treatments target these changes, be
