 potential will be equal to 
the solute potential of a solution in an 
open container because the pressure 
potential of the solution in an open 
container is zero. 
The Solute Potential of a Solution 
S
Y = -iCRT
i = ionization constant (this is 1.0 for 
sucrose because sucrose does not 
ionize in water) 
C = molar concentration 
R = pressure constant 
(R = 0.0831 liter bars/mole K) 
T = temperature in Kelvin (ºC + 273) 
Gibbs Free Energy 
ΔG = ΔH – TΔS 
ΔG = change in Gibbs free energy 
ΔS  = change in entropy 
ΔH = change in enthalpy  
T = absolute temperature (in Kelvin)
