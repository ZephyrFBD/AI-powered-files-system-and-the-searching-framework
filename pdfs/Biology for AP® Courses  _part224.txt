cule. Among the hydrophilic functional groups is the carboxyl
group found in amino acids, some amino acid side chains, and the fatty acids that form triglycerides and phospholipids.
This carboxyl group ionizes to release hydrogen ions (H+) from the COOH group resulting in the negatively charged COO-
group; this contributes to the hydrophilic nature of whatever molecule it is found on. Other functional groups, such as the
carbonyl group, have a partially negatively charged oxygen atom that may form hydrogen bonds with water molecules,
again making the molecule more hydrophilic.
Figure 2.29 The functional groups shown here are found in many different biological molecules.
Hydrogen bonds between functional groups (within the same molecule or between different molecules) are important to the
function of many macromolecules and help them to fold properly into and maintain the appropriate shape for functioning.
Hydrogen bonds are also involved in various recognition processes, such as DNA co
