lled electron spin, which 
is quantized. The spin magnetic quantum number, ms, can have two 
possible values, +1
2 and -1
2, which can be envisioned as the two direc-
tions of an electron spinning about an axis. The Pauli exclusion princi-
ple states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same values 
for n, l, ml, and ms. This principle places a limit of two on the number 
of electrons that can occupy any one atomic orbital. These two elec-
trons differ in their value of ms.
ELECTRON CONFIGURATIONS AND THE PERIODIC TABLE 
(SECTIONS 6.8 AND 6.9) The electron configuration of an atom 
describes how the electrons are distributed among the orbitals of 
the atom. The ground-state electron configurations are generally 
obtained by placing the electrons in the atomic orbitals of lowest 
possible energy with the restriction that each orbital can hold no 
more than two electrons. We depict the arrangement of the elec-
trons pictorially using an orbital diagram. When electrons occupy a
