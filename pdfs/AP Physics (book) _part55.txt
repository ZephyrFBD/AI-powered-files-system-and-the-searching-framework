them with other students. Problem solving is one of the great learning tools.
Don’t just look for a formula—it might be the wrong one.
NOTES ON THE FORMAT AND PROBLEM SOLVING
1. Sections marked with a star (*) are considered optional. They can be omitted
without interrupting the main flow of topics. No later material depends on
them except possibly later starred Sections. They may be fun to read, though.
2. The customary conventions are used: symbols for quantities (such as m for
mass) are italicized, whereas units (such as m for meter) are not italicized.
Symbols for vectors are shown in boldface with a small arrow above:

3. Few equations are valid in all situations. Where practical, the limitations of
important equations are stated in square brackets next to the equation. The
equations that represent the great laws of physics are displayed with a tan
background, as are a few other indispensable equations.
