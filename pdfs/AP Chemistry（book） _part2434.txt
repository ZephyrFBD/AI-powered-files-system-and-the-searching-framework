▲ Figure 15.12 Diagram of the industrial production of ammonia. Incoming N21g2 and H21g2 are  
heated to approximately 500 °C and passed over a catalyst. When the resultant N2, H2, and NH3  
mixture is cooled, the NH3 liquefies and is removed from the mixture, shifting the reaction to  
produce more NH3.
Give It Some Thought
Does the equilibrium 2 NO1g2 + O21g2 ∆ 2 NO21g2 shift to the right (more 
products) or left (more reactants) if
(a) O2 is added to the system?
(b) NO is removed?
Effects of Volume and Pressure Changes
If a system containing one or more gases is at equilibrium and its volume is decreased, 
thereby increasing its total pressure, Le Châtelier’s principle indicates that the system 
responds by shifting its equilibrium position to reduce the pressure. A system can reduce 
its pressure by reducing the total number of gas molecules (fewer molecules of gas exert 
a lower pressure). Thus, at constant temperature, reducing the volume of
