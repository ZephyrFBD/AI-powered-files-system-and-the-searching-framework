e focal length, as we saw in Section 23–7. For closer objects, the image distance
is greater than the focal length, as can be seen from the lens equation,
(Eq. 23–8). To focus on nearby objects, the lens must there-
fore be moved away from the sensor or film, and this is usually done on a manual
camera by turning a ring on the lens.
If the lens is focused on a nearby object, a sharp image of it will be formed,
but the image of distant objects may be blurry (Fig. 25–6). The rays from a point
on the distant object will be out of focus—instead of a point, they will form a
circle on the sensor or film as shown (exaggerated) in Fig. 25–7. The distant object
will thus produce an image consisting of overlapping circles and will be blurred.
These circles are called circles of confusion. To have near and distant objects sharp 
in the same photo, you (or the camera) can try setting the lens focus at an inter-
mediate position. For a given distance setting, there is a range of distances over
