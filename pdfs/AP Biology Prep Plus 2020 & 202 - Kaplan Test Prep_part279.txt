owever, it is significantly paler and has
smaller leaves. He also notes that while the uncovered plant grew
straight up, the covered plant grew toward the hole, as shown
below:
The botanist decides to redo the experiment, but this time, he
removes the growing tips from both plants. When he returns one
week later, he once again finds that the covered plant is pale with
small leaves. However, this time, it did not grow toward the light,
instead growing upward. Which of the following best explains
what has occurred?
By cutting the growing tip, the botanist blocked all
photoperiodic eﬀects by eliminating all of the plant’s
photoreceptors.
(A)
By cutting the growing tip, the botanist blocked all
phototropic eﬀects by eliminating all of the plant’s
photoreceptors.
(B)
By cutting the growing tip, the botanist eliminated all
photoperiodic eﬀects by blocking a signal to a growth
repressor responsible for slower elongation on the lit side.
(C)
By cutting the growing tip, the botanist eliminated
