of action against certain viruses remains unclear.
Figure 21.16 (a) Oseltamivir inhibits a viral enzyme called neuraminidase (NA) found in the influenza viral envelope.
(b) Neuraminidase cleaves the connection between viral hemagglutinin (HA), also found in the viral envelope, and
glycoproteins on the host cell surface. Inhibition of neuraminidase prevents the virus from detaching from the host cell,
thereby blocking further infection. (credit a: modification of work by M. Eickmann)
By far, the most successful use of antivirals has been in the treatment of the retrovirus HIV, which causes a disease that, if
untreated, is usually fatal within 10â€“12 years after infection. Anti-HIV drugs have been able to control viral replication to
the point that individuals receiving these drugs survive for a significantly longer time than the untreated.
Anti-HIV drugs inhibit viral replication at many different phases of the HIV replicative cycle (Figure 21.17). Drugs
have been developed that
