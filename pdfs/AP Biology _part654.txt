restrial organisms face entirely different problems. They have had
to evolve mechanisms and structures that enable them to rid themselves of
metabolic wastes while retaining as much water as possible.
EXCRETION
Different excretory mechanisms have evolved in various organisms for the
purpose of osmoregulation and for the removal of metabolic wastes. Here
are some organisms matched with their excretory structures:
Organism
Structures
Protista
Contractile vacuole
Platyhelminthes (planaria)
Flame cells
Earthworm
Nephridia (metanephridia)
Insects
Malpighian tubules
Humans
Nephrons
Excretion is the removal of metabolic wastes, which include carbon
dioxide and water from cell respiration and nitrogenous wastes from
protein metabolism. The organs of excretion in humans are the skin,
lungs, kidneys, and the liver (where urea is produced). There are three
nitrogenous wastes: ammonia, urea, and uric acid. Which waste an
organism excretes is the result of the environment it evolved in and lives
in
