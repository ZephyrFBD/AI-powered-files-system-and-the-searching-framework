Note that in both cases the formal charges add up to zero, as they must because CO2 is a neu-
tral molecule. So, which is the dominant structure? As a general rule, when more than one 
Lewis structure is possible, we will use the following guidelines to choose the dominant one:
How to Identify the Dominant Lewis Structure 
 
1. The dominant Lewis structure is generally the one in which the atoms bear formal 
charges closest to zero.
 
2. A Lewis structure in which any negative charges reside on the more electronegative 
atoms is generally more dominant than one that has negative charges on the less 
electronegative atoms.
Thus, the first Lewis structure of CO2 is the dominant one because the atoms carry no 
formal charges and so satisfy the first guideline. The other Lewis s
