ines to 
quantities that describe interactions among living systems 
and their environment that result in the movement of 
matter and energy.
The correct answer is 26 or 25. The problem is an application of the first law of 
thermodynamics, not the “10 percent rule” of energy transformation. To work this 
problem, all numbers should be converted to the same KJ/m2. There are TWO possible 
ways to arrive at the correct answer.
First, 14,100 KJ/m2 is 74.3 percent of the total accumulated biomass, so the shrubs would 
possess 25.7 percent of the total biomass.
 
A more complex pathway to the same answer is as follows: Energy accumulated as 
biomass is 1.9 x 104 KJ/m2 or 19,000 KJ/m2 and is distributed among the tree layer, shrub 
layer, and herb layer. The energy accumulated as biomass in the tree layer is 1.3 x 104 KJ/
m2 or 13,000 KJ/m2, and the energy accumulated as biomass in the herb layer is 1.1 x 
103 KJ/m2 or 1,100 KJ/m2. Together, the energy accumulated as biomass in the tree and
