Example 24–11. The incident and
reflected rays are assumed to be
perpendicular to the bubble’s
surface. They are shown at a slight
angle so we can distinguish them.

A formula is not enough: you must also
check for phase changes at surfaces
†Why? Recall that red starts at 600 nm in air; so most colors in the spectrum lie between 450 nm and
600 nm in air; but in water the wavelengths are 
times smaller, 340 nm to 450 nm, so a
100-nm thickness is a 200-nm path difference, not far from 
for most colors.

Farther down in Fig. 24–29b, with increasing thickness , a path difference
corresponds nicely to 
for blue, but not for other colors, so we see
blue (
path difference plus 
phase 
interference). Other
colors experience constructive interference (at 
and then at 
) at still greater
thicknesses, so going down we see a series of separated colors som
