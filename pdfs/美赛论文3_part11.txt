2.1.2 Hypothesis of model
During the process of water being cool in the bathtub, the temperature of the water
is the same throughout the whole bathtub and changes at the same pace.
The temperature of the air does not change as the time flows. In other words,
during the process of heat exchange between the water and the air, the temperature
of the air is literal.

0
k is only related to the area a
