 formed by 
adding a proton to the base. Thus, H3O+ is the conjugate acid of H2O, and HA is the con-
jugate acid of A-.
In any acid–base (proton-transfer) reaction, we can identify two sets of conjugate 
acid–base pairs. For example, consider the reaction between nitrous acid and water:
 
 
[16.7]
Likewise, for the reaction between NH3 and H2O (Equation 16.5), we have
 
[16.8]

Sample Exercise 16.1 
Identifying Conjugate Acids and Bases
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to give the conjugate base for several acids 
and the conjugate acid for several bases.
Plan The conjugate base of a substance is simply the parent sub-
stance minus one proton, and the c
