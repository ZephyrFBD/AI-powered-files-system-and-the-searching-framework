 
coordination complexes and how the 
geometries relate to coordination numbers.
 23.4 ▶  Nomenclature and Isomerism 
in Coordination Chemistry Learn 
the nomenclature used for naming metal 
complexes and become familiar with 
the concept of isomerism, where two 
compounds have the same composition but 
different structures.
 23.5 ▶  Color and Magnetism in 
Coordination Chemistry Discover 
the underlying causes of color in 
coordination compounds, emphasizing 
the visible portion of the electromagnetic 
spectrum and the notion of complementary 
colors. We then see that many transition-
metal complexes are paramagnetic because 
they contain unpaired electrons.
 23.6 ▶  Crystal-Field Theory Apply the 
concept of crystal-field theory to explain 
some of the interesting spectral and 
magnetic properties of coordination 
compounds.
