Sample Exercise 22.2 
Predicting the Products of Chemical Reactions
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the reactants for two chemical equations and 
asked to predict the products and then balance the equations.
Plan We need to examine the reactants to see if we might recog-
nize a reaction type. In (a) the carbon compound is reacting with 
O2, which suggests a combustion reaction. In (b) water reacts with 
an ionic compound. The anion P3- is a strong base and H2O is able 
to act as an acid, so the reactants suggest an acid–base  
(proton-transfer) reaction.
Solve
(a) Based on the elemental composition of the carbon com-
pound, this combustion reaction should produce CO2,  H2O, 
and N2 :
2 CH3NHNH21g2 + 5 O21g2 ¡ 2 CO21g2 + 6 H2O1g2 + 2 N21g2
(b) Mg3P2 is ionic, consisting of Mg2+ and P3- io
