postulate (the relati£ity principle): The laws of physics have the same
form in all inertial reference frames.
The first postulate can also be stated as: there is no experiment you can do in an
inertial reference frame to determine if you are at rest or moving uniformly at
constant velocity.
The second postulate is consistent with the first:
Second postulate (constancy of the speed of light): Light propagates through
empty space with a definite speed c independent of the speed of the source or
observer.
These two postulates form the foundation of Einstein’s special theory of relativity.
It is called “special” to distinguish it from his later “general theory of relativity,”
which deals with noninertial (accelerating) reference frames (Chapter 33). The
special theory, which is what we discuss here, deals only with inertial frames.
The second postulate may seem hard to accept, for it seems to violate common
sense. First of all, we have to think of light traveling through empty space. Givi
