4. Which of the following best describes the differences between saturated and unsaturated lipids?
(A) Saturated lipids have at least one C=C double bond and tend to be solid at room temperature. Unsaturated
lipids have no double bonds and tend to be liquid at room temperature.
(B) Saturated lipids have at least one C=C double bond, which makes them amphipathic. Unsaturated lipids
have no double bonds and are hydrophilic.
(C) Saturated lipids have no C=C double bonds and tend to be solid at room temperature. Unsaturated lipids
have at least one C=C double bond and tend to be liquid at room temperature.
(D) Saturated and unsaturated lipids both have C=C double bonds. Saturated lipids are hydrophobic, and
unsaturated lipids are hydrophilic.
