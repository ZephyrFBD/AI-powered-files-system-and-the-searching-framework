erturbations in the frequencies of alleles. There are no
bottleneck eï¬€ects.
1.
The population is isolated from both immigration and
emigration. There is no gene flow.
2.
There is no mutation.
3.
There is no selective breeding, and mating is random between
individuals.
4.
Keep in mind that the theoretical Hardy-Weinberg population is the
benchmark to which all naturally occurring populations are compared.
There are probably few if any populations in complete equilibrium.
Comparing the expected frequencies under the previously given
assumptions to what actually occurs in a population gives insight into
which of these assumptions is being violated. In this way, a scientist can
determine which evolutionary or environmental forces prevent a
population from maintaining equilibrium.
AP EXPERT NOTE
There is a good likelihood that you will see some sort of Hardy-
Weinberg question in either the grid-in or free-response section of
the exam.
For this experiment, we can make assumptions about the
