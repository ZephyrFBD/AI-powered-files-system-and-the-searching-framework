e CO21g2 as the only 
carbon-containing product. (b) Write a balanced chemi-
cal equation for the incomplete combustion of methane 
to produce CO(g) as the only carbon-containing product. 
(c) At 25 °C and 1.0 atm pressure, what is the minimum 
quantity of dry air needed to combust 1.0 L of CH41g2 com-
pletely to CO21g2?
 18.70  It was estimated that the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo 
volcano resulted in the injection of 20 million metric tons 
of SO2 into the atmosphere. Most of this SO2 underwent 
oxidation to SO3, which reacts with atmospheric water to 
form an aerosol. (a) Write chemical equations for the pro-
cesses leading to formation of the aerosol. (b) The aero-
sols caused a 0.590.6 °C drop in surface temperature in the 
northern hemisphere. What is the mechanism by which 
this occurs? (c) The sulfate aerosols, as they are called, 
also cause loss of ozone from the stratosphere. How might 
this occur?
 18.71  One of the possible consequences of climate change is an
