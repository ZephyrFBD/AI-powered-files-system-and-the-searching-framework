Chapter 7
Cell Communication and Cell Cycle
CELL COMMUNICATION
Communication is important for organisms and involves transduction of stimulatory or inhibitory signals from other
cells, organisms, or the environment. Unicellular organisms detect and respond to environmental signals. For
example, they can use cell communication to locate a suitable mate, adapt metabolism rates in response to changes
in nutrient availability, or make their numbers known to other members of their species (a phenomenon known as
quorum sensing).
