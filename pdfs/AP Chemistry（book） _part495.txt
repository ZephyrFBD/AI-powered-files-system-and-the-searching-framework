Formula Weights (Section 3.3)
 3.23 Determine the formula weights of each of the following com-
pounds: (a) nitric acid, HNO3; (b) KMnO4; (c) Ca31PO422;  
(d) quartz, SiO2; (e) gallium sulfide, (f) chromium(III) sulfate, 
(g) phosphorus trichloride.
Chemical Equations and Simple Patterns  
of Chemical Reactivity (Sections 3.1 and 3.2)
 
3.9 Write “true” or “false” for each statement. (a) We balance 
chemical equations as we do because energy must be con-
served. (b) If the reaction 2 O3(g) S 3 O2(g) goes to comple-
tion and all O3 is converted to O2, then the mass of O3 at 
the beginning of the reaction must be the same as the mass 
of O2 at the end of the reaction. (c) You can balance the 
 
“water-splitting” reaction H2O(l) S H2(g) + O2(g) by writing 
it this way: H2O2(l) S H2(g) + O2(g).
