5. 
Speciation involves the evolutionary formation of new and genetically
distinct species. Figure 1 shows two types of speciation.
Figure 1.  Allopatric and Sympatric Speciation
Describe the three stages of speciation shown in the figure.
(a)
Explain the diﬀerence between allopatric and sympatric speciation.
(b)
Selecting from allopatric and sympatric speciation, identify which
type of speciation A and B in the figure represent.
(c)
Explain whether allopatric or sympatric specification is the more
common mode of speciation.

6. Point mutations that involve the substitution of a base can result in a
silent, missense, or nonsense mutation. Scientists investigated three
diﬀerent point mutations in the genes of hemoglobin. The results are
shown in the table.
