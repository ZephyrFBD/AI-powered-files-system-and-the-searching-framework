ilaments begin
to overlap with each otherâ€”reducing cross-bridge formation even further, and producing even less tension. Conversely, if
the sarcomere is stretched to the point at which thick and thin filaments do not overlap at all, no cross-bridges are formed
and no tension is produced. This amount of stretching does not usually occur because accessory proteins, internal sensory
nerves, and connective tissue oppose extreme stretching.
The primary variable determining force production is the number of myofibers within the muscle that receive an action
potential from the neuron that controls that fiber. When using the biceps to pick up a pencil, the motor cortex of the brain
only signals a few neurons of the biceps, and only a few myofibers respond. In vertebrates, each myofiber responds fully
if stimulated. When picking up a piano, the motor cortex signals all of the neurons in the biceps and every myofiber
participates. This is close to the maximum force the muscle can produce. As men
