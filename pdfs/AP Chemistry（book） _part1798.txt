tractive force operates 
between all molecules? (b) Which type of intermolecular 
attractive force operates only between polar molecules? 
 
(c) Which type of intermolecular attractive force operates 
only between the hydrogen atom of a polar bond and a 
nearby small electronegative atom?
 11.16  (a) Which is generally stronger, intermolecular interac-
tions or intramolecular interactions? (b) Which of these 
kinds of interactions are broken when a liquid is converted 
to a gas?
 11.17  Describe the intermolecular forces that must be overcome 
to convert these substances from a liquid to a gas: (a) SO2, 
(b) CH3COOH, (c) H2S.
 11.18  Which type of intermolecular force accounts for each of 
these differences? (a) CH3OH boils at 65 °C; CH3SH boils at 
6 °C. (b) Xe is a liquid at atmospheric pressure and 120 K, 
 
whereas Ar is a gas under the same conditions. (c) Kr, 
atomic weight 84 amu, boils at 120.9 K, whereas Cl2, molec-
ular weight about 71 amu, boils at 238 K. (d) Acetone boils
