*All metals become liquids if heated sufficiently. Hg simply has the lowest melting point of any 
metallic element. Although sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), and gal-
lium (Ga) are solids at room temperature, they all melt at temperatures below 100 °C.

The Periodic Table

The metals are separated from the nonmetallic elements, or nonmetals, by a stepped 
line that runs from boron (B) to astatine (At). (Note that hydrogen, although on the left 
side of the table, is a nonmetal.) At room temperature and pressure, some of the nonmet-
als are gaseous, some are solid, and one is liquid. Nonmetals generally differ from metals 
in appearance (Figure 2.16) and in other physical properties. Many of the elements that 
lie along the line that separates metals from nonmetals have
