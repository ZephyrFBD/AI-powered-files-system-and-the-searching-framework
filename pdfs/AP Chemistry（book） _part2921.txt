 particles, the water may first be made slightly basic with CaO.
2. Then Al21SO423 is added and reacts with OH- ions to form a spongy, gelatinous 
precipitate of Al1OH23 1Ksp = 1.3 * 10-332. This precipitate settles slowly, carrying 
suspended particles down with it, thereby removing nearly all finely divided matter 
and most bacteria.
3. The water is then filtered through a sand bed.
4. Following filtration, the water may be sprayed into the air (aeration) to hasten oxi-
dation of dissolved inorganic ions of iron and manganese, reduce concentrations of 
any H2S or NH3 that may be present, and reduce bacterial concentrations.
