Adenine and thymine form two
hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine form
three hydrogen bonds. The two individual
strands of DNA are held together by covalent
bonds between the phosphate of one nucleotide
and sugar of the next. The two strands run
antiparallel to each other.
b.
DNA is composed of nucleotides, consisting of a
5 carbon sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous
base. DNA is a double helical structure in which
complementary base pairing occurs. Adenine
pairs with cytosine and guanine pairs with
thymine. Adenine and cytosine form two
hydrogen bonds and guanine and thymine form
three hydrogen bonds. The two individual
strands of DNA are held together by covalent
bonds between the phosphate of one nucleotide
and sugar of the next. The two strands run
antiparallel to each other.
