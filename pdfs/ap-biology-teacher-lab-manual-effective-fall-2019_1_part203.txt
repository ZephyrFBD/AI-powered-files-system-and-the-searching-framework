thematical equations, several of which are based on the Hardy-
Weinberg (H-W) equilibrium. Students (and their teachers) have traditionally found the 
topic of population genetics in an introductory biology class to be challenging, due in 
part to the fact that for the last couple of generations biology has been thought of as the 
science with only a minimal mathematics foundation — particularly in comparison to 
chemistry or physics. Modern biology, however, is vastly different.  
One of the specific difficulties of the H-W null hypothesis is that it is the null 
hypothesis — it is what would happen to allele frequencies in the absence of any 
evolutionary parameter. This is counterintuitive for most students. H-W is the standard 
by which evolution can be measured. To that end, most simulations that try to create 
a population manipulated by students to model H-W are flawed from the beginning. 
Student classroom populations, by definition, are so small that genetic drift will swamp
