polarizability The ease with which the electron cloud of an 
atom or a molecule is distorted by an outside influence, thereby 
inducing a dipole moment. (Section 11.2)
polar molecule A molecule in which the centers of positive and 
negative charge do not coincide; a molecule that possesses a 
nonzero dipole moment. (Section 8.4)
polyatomic ion An electrically charged group of two or more 
atoms. (Section 2.7)
polydentate ligand A ligand in which two, three, or more donor 
atoms can coordinate to the same metal ion. (Section 23.3)
polymer Large molecules with long chains of atoms (usually 
carbon), where the atoms within a given chain are connected 
by covalent bonds and adjacent chains are held to one another 
largely by weaker intermolecular forces. (Sections 12.1 and 12.8)
polypeptide A polymer of amino acids formed when a large 
number of amino acids (730) are linked together by peptide 
bonds. (Section 24.7)
