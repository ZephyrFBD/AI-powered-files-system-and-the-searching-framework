hange the shape of the binding site. 
The optimum reaction conditions are different for each enzyme. The correct 
environmental conditions, proper substrates, and, often, particular cofactors associated 
with an enzyme are needed. In some instances, the optimum conditions can be deduced 
fairly accurately based on the following:
Bullet The organism from which the enzyme is derived 
Bullet The part of the organism in which the enzyme functions
Bullet The environmental conditions in which that organism lives
For example, this investigation mentions lactase, the enzyme that catabolizes the 
disaccharide sugar lactose into the two monosaccharides, glucose and galactose. In 
humans, lactase is found mostly in the small intestine, where the pH is around 7. It 
would be reasonable to hypothesize that human lactase is optimally active at pH 7 and 
at 37Â°C. Free-living decomposer fungi in soil also produce lactase. However, soil pH 
usually is between 5 and 6.5. As could be predicted, the purif
