t is,
would sunlight still be white, or would it be some other color?

1. Light passing through a double-slit arrangement is viewed
on a distant screen. The interference pattern observed on the
screen would have the widest spaced fringes for the case of
(a) red light and a small slit spacing.
(b) blue light and a small slit spacing.
(c) red light and a large slit spacing.
(d) blue light and a large slit spacing.
2. Light from a green laser of wavelength 530 nm passes
through two slits that are 400 nm apart. The resulting pattern
formed on a screen in front of the slits is shown in Fig.24–55.
If point A is the same distance from both slits, how much
closer is point B to one slit than to the other?
(a) 530 nm.
(b) 265 nm.
(c) 400 nm.
(d) 0 nm.
(e) It depends on the distance to the screen.
4. A double-slit experiment yields an interference pattern due
to the path length difference from light traveling through one
slit versus the other. Why does a single slit show a di
