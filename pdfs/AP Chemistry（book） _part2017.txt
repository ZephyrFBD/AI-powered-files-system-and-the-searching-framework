One method to synthesize ionic solids is by the heating of 
two reactants at high temperatures. Consider the reaction 
of FeO with TiO2 to form FeTiO3. Determine the amount of 
each of the two reactants to prepare 2.500 g FeTiO3, assum-
ing the reaction goes to completion.
(a) Write a balanced chemical reaction.
(b) Calculate the formula weight of FeTiO3.
(c) Determine the moles of FeTiO3.
(d) Determine moles and mass (g) of FeO required.
(e) Determine moles and mass (g) of TiO2 required.

Look up the diameter of a silicon atom, in Å. The latest 
semiconductor chips have fabricated lines as small as 14 
nm. How many silicon atoms does this correspond to?

As we noted in the earlier chapters, homogeneous mixtures are called 
solutions. 
 (Sections 1.2 and 4.1)
When we think of solutions, we usually think of liquids, like those 
in this chapter’s opening
