y, from 200 to 1000 K in Figure 10.19—
the negative deviation of PV>RT from the ideal value of 1 disappears. As noted earlier, 
the deviations seen at high temperatures stem mainly from the effect of the finite vol-
umes of the molecules.
The van der Waals Equation
Engineers and scientists who work with gases at high pressures often cannot use the 
ideal-gas equation because departures from ideal behavior are too large. One useful 
equation developed to predict the behavior of real gases was proposed by the Dutch 
scientist Johannes van der Waals (1837–1923).
As we have seen, a real gas has a lower pressure due to intermolecular forces, and a 
larger volume due to the finite volume of the molecules, relative to an ideal gas. Van der 
Waals recognized that it would be possible to retain the form of the ideal-gas equation, 
PV = nRT, if corrections were made to the pressure and the volume. He introduced two 
constants for these corrections: a, a measure of how strongly the gas molecules
