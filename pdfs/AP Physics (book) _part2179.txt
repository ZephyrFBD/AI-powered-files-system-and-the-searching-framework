 Just as we drew electric field lines, we
can also draw magnetic field lines.They can be drawn, as for electric field lines, so that
1. the direction of the magnetic field is tangent to a field line at any point, and
2. the number of lines per unit area is proportional to the strength of the
magnetic field.
The direction of the magnetic field at a given location can be defined as the
direction that the north pole of a compass needle would point if placed at that loca-
tion. (We will give a more precise definition of magnetic field shortly.) Figure 20–4a
shows how thin iron filings (acting like tiny magnets) reveal the magnetic field
lines by lining up like the compass needles. The magnetic field determined in this
way for the field surrounding a bar magnet is shown in Fig. 20–4b. Notice that
because of our definition, the lines always point out from the north pole and in
toward the south pole of a magnet (the north pole of a magnetic compass needle
is attracted to the south pole of the
