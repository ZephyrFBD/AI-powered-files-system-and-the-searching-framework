enetic analysis has shown that a single gene controls tail-feather length in the finch populations and that the 
allele for long tail feathers (L) is dominant to the allele for short tail feathers (l). On two separate islands, the 
scientists recorded the number of finches with long tail feathers and the number of finches with short tail 
feathers. The results are shown in the table below.
