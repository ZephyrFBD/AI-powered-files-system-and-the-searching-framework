analyze your data. (3 points)
State whether you would reject the null hypothesis or fail to
reject the null hypothesis, given the data. Explain your
reasoning for your statistical decision. (2 points)
Cellular respiration is the process by which living cells extract
energy from the oxidation of glucose, which results in the formation
of the waste products CO2 and H2O. The rate of cellular respiration
can be determined by measuring the volume of oxygen used or the
volume of carbon dioxide released. The overall equation for the
complete oxidation of glucose is:
C6H12O6+6O2â†’6CO2+6H2O + 36 ATP
Devise an experiment that will measure the rate of cellular
respiration in a living organism. Create TWO treatments under
different conditions. Draw and label your apparatus, and
explain how it works. (2 points)
Graph the predicted data from your experiment on the grid
lines below. Be sure that your graph has an appropriately
labeled x-axis and y-axi
