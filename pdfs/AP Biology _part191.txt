product. Therefore, malonate must have blocked the receptor on the
SDH enzyme, preventing succinate from doing so. The description
of the experiment states that production of fumarate decreased, not
increased. (ENE-1)
(D) The question asks about malonate combining with SDH.
Therefore, eliminate choices A and B. When malonate binds to the
SDH enzyme, no product is formed. That is what choice D shows.
(SP 4)
(D) The lock and key model is outdated, which eliminates choices A
and B. We now know that when the substrate binds to the enzyme, it
induces the enzyme to change its shape a bit in order to make a tight
fit. That is what is shown in illustration B and described in choice D.
