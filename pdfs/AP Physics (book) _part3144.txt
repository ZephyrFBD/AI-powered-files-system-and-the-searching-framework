thin) at places,
especially far away, but never becomes zero. So quantum mechanics suggests
that an atom is not mostly empty space, and that there is no truly empty space in
the universe.

28–6 Quantum Mechanics of the 
Hydrogen Atom; Quantum Numbers
We now look more closely at what quantum mechanics tells us about the
hydrogen atom. Much of what we say here also applies to more complex atoms,
which are discussed in the next Section.
Quantum mechanics is a much more sophisticated and successful theory than
Bohr’s. Yet in a few details they agree. Quantum mechanics predicts the same
basic energy levels (Fig. 27–29) for the hydrogen atom as does the Bohr model.
That is,
where n is an integer. In the simple Bohr model, there was only one quantum
number, n. In quantum mechanics, four different quantum numbers are needed
to specify each state in the atom:
(1) The quantum number, n, from the Bohr model is found also in quantum
mechanics and is
