 the 
helium-4 nucleus (an alpha particle) has a mass of 4.00150 amu. The mass of a proton is 
1.00728 amu and that of a neutron is 1.00866 amu. Consequently, two protons and two 
neutrons have a total mass of 4.03188 amu:
 
Mass of two protons = 211.00728 amu2 = 2.01456 amu
 
Mass of two neutrons = 211.00866 amu2 = 2.01732 amu
         
 
 
 
 
  Total mass = 4.03188 amu
The mass of the individual nucleons is 0.03038 amu greater than that of the helium-4 nucleus:
 
Mass of two protons and two neutrons = 4.03188 amu
 
Mass of 4
2He nucleus = 4.00150 amu
 
Mass difference ∆m = 0.03038 amu
The mass difference between a nucleus and its constituent nucleons is called the 
mass defect. The origin of the mass defect is readily understood if we consider that 
energy must be added to a nucleus to break it into separated protons and neutrons:
 
Energy + 4
2He ¡ 2 1
1H + 2 1

By Einstein’s relation, the addition of energy to a system must be accompanied by a pro-
portional increase in
