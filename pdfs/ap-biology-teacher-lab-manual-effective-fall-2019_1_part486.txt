■ Case 2: Philadelphia Chromosomes 
In normal cells, mitosis usually is blocked if there is DNA damage. Sometimes, though, 
DNA damage makes cells divide more often. Certain forms of leukemia have a unique 
feature called a Philadelphia chromosome. Look at the karyotype of leukemia cells in 
Figure 5, and answer the following questions: 
•  What happens in a normal cell if the DNA has mutations? 
•  What would happen if cells with mutated DNA replicated? 
•  How do cells monitor DNA integrity? 
•  How are the chromosomes different in the cancer cells compared to normal cells? 
•  How could these differences lead to cancer?

Meiosis resembles mitosis but serves a very different purpose. Me
