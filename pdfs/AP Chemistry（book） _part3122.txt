 19.42  Predict the sign of ∆Ssys for each of the following processes: 
(a) Molten gold solidifies. (b) Gaseous Cl2 dissociates 
in the stratosphere to form gaseous Cl atoms. (c) Gas-
eous CO reacts with gaseous H2 to form liquid methanol,

Entropy Changes in Chemical Reactions  
(Section 19.4)
 19.43  (a) Using Figure 19.12 as a model, sketch how the entropy 
of water changes as it is heated from -50 °C to 110 °C at 
sea level. Show the temperatures at which there are verti-
cal increases in entropy. (b) Which process has the larger 
entropy change: melting ice or boiling water? Explain.
 19.44  Propanol 1C3H7OH2 melts at -126.5 °C and boils at 
97.4 °C. Sketch how the entropy changes as propanol is 
heated from -150 °C to 150 °C at 1 at
