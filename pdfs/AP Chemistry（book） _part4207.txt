Figure 6.4 Longer by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude (depending on 
what part of the microwave spectrum is considered). Figure 6.5  
The part of the nail glowing yellow is hotter than the part glow-
ing red. Figure 6.7 As the frequency of the incoming light is 
increased the photon energy will increase and the kinetic energy 
of the ejected electrons will increase. Figure 6.12 The n = 2 to 
n = 1 transition involves a larger energy change than the n = 3 to 
n = 2 transition. (Compare the lengths of the arrows connecting the 
states in the figure.) If the n = 3 to n = 2 transition produces visible 
light, the n = 2 to n = 1 transition must produce radiation of greater 
energy. Of the two choices only ultraviolet radiation has higher  
frequency and greater energy than visible light. Figure 6.13  
The n = 4 to n = 3 transition involves a smaller
