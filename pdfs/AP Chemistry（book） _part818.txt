We can esti-
mate the enthalpy changes during chemical reactions involving gas-
eous substances by adding the average bond enthalpies of the bonds 
that are broken and subtracting the average bond enthalpies of the 
bonds that are formed. When the energy needed to break bonds is 
larger than the energy released by forming bonds the reaction en-
thalpy is positive; when the opposite situation holds the reaction 
enthalpy is negative.
FOODS AND FUELS (SECTION 5.9) The fuel value of a substance 
is the heat released when one gram of the substance is com-
busted. Different types of foods have different fuel values and 
differing abilities to be stored in the body. The most common fu-
els are hydrocarbons that are found as fossil fuels, such as natu-
ral gas, petroleum, and coal. Renewable energy sources include solar 
energy, wind energy, biomass, and hydroelectric energy. Nuclear 
power does not utilize fossil fuels but does create controversial 
waste-disposal problems.
