se in frequency within the population. This leads to two kinds of sexual selection, as follows:
Male competition leads to contests of strength that award mating opportunities to the strongest males. The
evolution of antlers, horns, and large stature or musculature are examples of this kind of sexual selection.
Female choice leads to traits or behaviors in males that are attractive to females. Colorful bird plumage (the
peacock’s tail is an extreme example) or elaborate mating behaviors are examples. Sexual selection often leads to
sexual dimorphism, differences in the appearance of males and females. When this occurs, sexual selection is a
form of disruptive selection.

that possess desirable traits. Since it is carried out by humans, it is not “natural” selection, but is given here for
comparison.
