16. Using the model of speciation and applying it to  
a different population, which of the following 
outcomes is most consistent for a different species 
in which the males are homogametic and the 
females are heterogametic? 
(A) Sterility would appear in females before 
appearing in males. 
(B) Speciation would occur more rapidly because 
females would produce more offspring. 
(C) Behavioral isolation would occur sooner in 
species exhibiting nonrandom mating. 
(D) The population would reach  
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at  
an accelerated rate.
