ted against mass number. Binding energy per nucleon at first increases in magni-
tude as mass number increases, reaching about 1.4 * 10-12 J for nuclei whose mass 
numbers are in the vicinity of iron-56. It then decreases slowly to about 1.2 * 10-12 J 
for very heavy nuclei. This trend indicates that nuclei of intermediate mass numbers are 
more tightly bound (and therefore more stable) than those with either smaller or larger mass 
numbers.
This trend has two significant consequences: First, heavy nuclei gain stability and 
therefore give off energy if they are fragmented into two midsized nuclei. This process, 
known as fission, is used to generate energy in nuclear power plants. Second, because of 
the sharp increase in the graph for small mass numbers, even greater amounts of energy 
are released if very light nuclei are combined, or fused togethe
