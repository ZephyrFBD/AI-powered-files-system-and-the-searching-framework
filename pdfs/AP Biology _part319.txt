ligase.
Other proteins and enzymes assist in replication of the DNA.
Helicases are enzymes that untwist the double helix at the
replication fork. They separate the two parental strands, making
these strands available as templates. Single-stranded binding
proteins act as scaffolding, holding the two DNA strands apart.
Topoisomerases lessen the tension on the tightly wound helix by
breaking, swiveling, and rejoining the DNA strands.
DNA polymerases carry out mismatch repair, a kind of
proofreading that corrects errors. Damaged regions of DNA are
excised by DNA nuclease.
Each time the DNA replicates, some nucleotides from the ends of
the chromosomes are lost. To protect against the possible loss of
genes at the ends of the chromosomes, eukaryotes have special

nonsense nucleotide sequences (TTAGGG) at the ends of the
chromosomes that repeat thousands of times. These protective ends
are called telomeres. Telomeres are created and maint
