tissues during
embryological development confirms that they have evolved independently.
3. Parallel evolution describes two related species or two related lineages that have made similar evolutionary
changes after their divergence from a common ancestor.
 
Species from two groups of mammals, the marsupial mammals and the placental mammals, have independently
evolved similar adaptations when ancestors encountered comparable environments.
4. Coevolution is the tit-for-tat evolution of one species in response to new adaptations that appear in another
species. Suppose a prey species gains an adaptation that allows it to escape its predator. Although most of the
predators will fail to catch prey, some variants in the predator population will be successful. Selection favors these
successful variants and subsequent evolution results in new adaptations in the predator species.
Coevolution occurs between predator and prey, plants and planteating insects, pollinators and flowering plants, and
