s and
less reliable, so there is more uncertainty in the measurements of large distances.
33â€“4 General Relativity: Gravity
and the Curvature of Space
We have seen that the force of gravity plays an important role in the processes
that occur in stars. Gravity too is important for the evolution of the universe as
a whole. The reasons gravity plays a dominant role in the universe, and not one
of the other of the four forces in nature, are (1) it is long-range and (2) it is always
attractive. The strong and weak nuclear forces act over very short distances only,
on the order of the size of a nucleus; hence they do not act over astronomical
distances (they do act between nuclei and nucleons in stars to produce nuclear
reactions). The electromagnetic force, like gravity, acts over great distances. But
it can be either attractive or repulsive. And since the universe does not seem to
contain large areas of net electric charge, a large net force does not occur. But
gravity acts only as an attra
