portant example of ligand-gated ion channel involves acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that is the signaling
molecule that transmits nerve impulses between nerve cells (neurons). A neuron that is transmitting a signal releases
acetylcholine into the extracellular space between neurons (the synaptic cleft, or synapse). When acetylcholine
binds to the ligandgated receptor molecules of the receiving neuron, the receptor molecules
open a gated channel that allows sodium ions (Na+) to enter the cell. As Na+enters the cell, the inside of the cell
becomes more positive. This
change in membrane voltage (called an action potential) initiates a nerve impulse. Neurons stimulate muscle
contraction in a similar process. (More details on nerve transmission and muscle contraction are presented in
Chapter 13, “Animal Form and Function.”)
