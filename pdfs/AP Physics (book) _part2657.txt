To see how a diffraction pattern arises, we analyze the important case of
monochromatic light passing through a narrow slit (as for Fig. 24–19c). We assume
that parallel rays (plane waves) of light pass straight through a slit of width D
to a viewing screen very far away.† As we know from studying water waves and
from Huygens’ principle, waves passing through a slit spread out in all directions.
We will now examine how the waves passing through different parts of the slit
interfere with each other.

†If the viewing screen is not far away, lenses can be used to make the rays parallel.
