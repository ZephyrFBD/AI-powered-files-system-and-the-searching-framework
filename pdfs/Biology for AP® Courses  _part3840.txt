retic hormone
(ADH) from the hypothalamus, leading to water retention in the kidneys. It acts directly on the nephrons and decreases
glomerular filtration rate. Medically, blood pressure can be controlled by drugs that inhibit ACE (called ACE inhibitors).

Mineralocorticoids
Mineralocorticoids are hormones synthesized by the adrenal cortex that affect osmotic balance. Aldosterone is a
mineralocorticoid that regulates sodium levels in the blood. Almost all of the sodium in the blood is reclaimed by the renal
tubules under the influence of aldosterone. Because sodium is always reabsorbed by active transport and water follows
sodium to maintain osmotic balance, aldosterone manages not only sodium levels but also the water levels in body fluids.
