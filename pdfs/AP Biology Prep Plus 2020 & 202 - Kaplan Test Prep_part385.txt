t of protons across the thylakoid
membrane. Synthesized ATP and NADPH are then used to
produce carbohydrates in the chloroplast stroma. Which of the
following figures most accurately illustrates ETC reactions and
ATP synthesis in chloroplasts?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
2. The diagram above illustrates cyclic and noncyclic
photophosphorylation. High concentrations of NADPH in the
chloroplast of a plant cell will cause a shiȇ from noncyclic
photophosphorylation to cyclic photophosphorylation. Which of
the following best describes a likely result of this shiȇ?
ATP levels will increase to meet cell energy demands.
(A)
ATP levels will become depleted as oxygen is produced.
(B)
NADPH and ATP will be used in the Krebs cycle to synthesize
carbohydrates.
(C)
The reaction center in photosystem I will produce increased
levels of oxygen and NADPH.
(D)
3. Human red blood cells lack mitochondria. Which of the following
correctly explains the primary pathway that red blood cells use to
produce energy?
Red bloo
