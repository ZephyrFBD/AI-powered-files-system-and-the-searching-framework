ow atomic number  
and mass number can be used to express  
the number of each subatomic particle—
protons, neutrons, and electrons—in a  
given atom.
 
2.4 ▶ Atomic Weights Learn about the 
concept of atomic weights and how they are 
derived from the masses and abundances of 
individual atoms.
 
2.5 ▶ The Periodic Table Examine the 
organization of the periodic table, in which 
elements are put in order of increasing atomic 
number and grouped by chemical similarity.
 
2.6 ▶ Molecules and Molecular 
Compounds Explore the assemblies of 
atoms called molecules and learn how their 
compositions are represented by empirical 
and molecular formulas.
 
2.7 ▶ Ions and Ionic Compounds Realize 
that atoms can gain or lose electrons to form 
ions and learn how to use the periodic table 
to predict the charges on ions as well as the 
empirical formulas of ionic compounds.
 
2.8 ▶ Naming Inorganic Compounds  
Consider the systematic way in which 
substances are named, called nomenclature, 
and ho
