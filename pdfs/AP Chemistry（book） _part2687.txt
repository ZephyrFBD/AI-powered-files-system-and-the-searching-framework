ibrium constants, and so 
the amount of acetate formed will only be limited by the relative amounts of the acid 
and strong base that are mixed. The resulting solution is the same as if you added sodium 
acetate to the acetic acid solution: You will have comparable quantities of both acetic 
acid and its conjugate base in solution.
By choosing appropriate components and adjusting their relative concentrations, 
we can buffer a solution at virtually any pH.
Give It Some Thought
If solutions of NH4Cl1aq2 and NH31aq2 are mixed, which ions in the resulting 
solution are spectator ions in any acid–base chemistry occurring in the solution? 
What equilibrium reaction determines 3OH-4 and, therefore, the pH of the 
solution?

Give It Some Thought
Which of these conjugate acid–base pairs will not function as a buffer: 
C2H5COOH and C2H5COO-, HCO3
- and CO3
