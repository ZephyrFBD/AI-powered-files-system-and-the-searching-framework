 osmotic balance important to body functions?
•
What is osmolarity and how is it measured?
•
What are osmoregulators or osmoconformers, and how do these tools allow animals to adapt to different
environments?
Connection for AP® Courses
Much of the information in this chapter is not within the scope for AP®. However, the chapter is filled with illustrative
examples that are applicable to concepts we’ve explored previously, including chemistry, structure of the plasma cell
membrane, and movement of molecules across membranes. With this in mind, it is helpful to have a general understanding
how the human body, specifically the excretory system, maintains osmotic homeostasis despite the influence of external
factors like temperature, diet, and varying environmental conditions. For example, if we drink eight to ten glasses of water
per day, the human body excretes that water via urination, defecation, sweating, and, to a small extent, respiration.
