the second law of thermodynamics explains why these tasks are harder than they appear. None of the energy transfers
weâ€™ve discussed, along with all energy transfers and transformations in the universe, is completely efficient. In every
energy transfer, some amount of energy is lost in a form that is unusable. In most cases, this form is heat energy.
Thermodynamically, heat energy is defined as the energy transferred from one system to another that is not doing work.
For example, when an airplane flies through the air, some of the energy of the flying plane is lost as heat energy due to
friction with the surrounding air. This friction actually heats the air by temporarily increasing the speed of air molecules.
Likewise, some energy is lost as heat energy during cellular metabolic reactions. This is good for warm-blooded creatures
like us, because heat energy helps to maintain our body temperature. Strictly speaking, no
