cytoplasm. As the central vacuole shrinks, it leaves
the cell wall unsupported. This loss of support to the cell walls of plant cells results in the wilted appearance of the plant.
The central vacuole also supports the expansion of the cell. When the central vacuole holds more water, the cell gets larger
without having to invest a lot of energy in synthesizing new cytoplasm.
Activity
•
Construct a concept map or Venn diagram to describe the relationships that exist among the three
domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya) based on cellular features. Share your diagram with
other students in the class for review and revision.
•
Mystery Cell ID. Using a microscope, identify several types of cells, e.g., prokaryote/eukaryote, plant/
animal, based on general features and justify your identification.
•
Ten-Minute Debate. Working in small teams, create a visual representation to support the claim that
eukaryotes evolved from symbiotic relationships among groups of prokaryotes.
