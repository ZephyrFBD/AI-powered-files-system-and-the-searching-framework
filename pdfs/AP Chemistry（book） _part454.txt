 in the H2O—the masses of C and H in the alcohol 
before combustion. The mass of O in the compound equals the mass 
of the original sample minus the sum of the C and H masses. Once we 
have the C, H, and O masses, we can proceed as in Sample Exercise 3.13.
 
Check We can have confidence in the result because dividing mo-
lecular weight by empirical formula weight yields nearly a whole 
number.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Cyclohexane, a commonly used organic solvent, is 85.6% C 
and 14.4% H by mass with a molar mass of 84.2 g>mol.  
What is its  
molecular formula?  
(a) C6H (b) CH2 (c) C5H24 (d) C6H12 (e) C4H8
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Ethylene glycol, used in automobile antifreeze, is 38.7% C, 
9.7% H, and 51.6% O by mass. Its molar mass is 62.1 g/mol.  
(a) What is the empirical formula of ethylene glycol? (b) What 
is its molecular formula?
O2
