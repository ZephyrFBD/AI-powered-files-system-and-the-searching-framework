utrients for
the cell.
d.
The extracellular matrix connects the cell to the
external environment and ensures correct
positioning of the cell to prevent metastasis.
27. Give an example for each one of the following effects
of a cell signal: on protein expression, cellular metabolism,
and cell division.
a.
protein expression: binding of epinephrine
(adrenaline) to a G-protein-linked receptor;
cellular metabolism: the MAP-kinase cascade;
cell division: promoted by the binding of the
EGF to its receptor tyrosine kinase
b.
protein expression: the MAP-kinase cascade;
cellular metabolism- binding of epinephrine
(adrenaline) to a G-protein-linked receptor; cell
division promoted by the binding of the EGF to
its receptor tyrosine kinase
c.
protein expression: binding of the EGF to its
receptor tyrosine kinase; cellular metabolism:
the MAP-kinase cascade; cell division: FAS-
RAS signaling.
d.
protein expression: RAS signaling; cellular
metabolism: binding of the EGF to its receptor
tyrosine kina
