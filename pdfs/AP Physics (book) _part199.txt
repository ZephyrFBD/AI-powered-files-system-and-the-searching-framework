that accelerates from rest to 
in the same time.
5. Can an object have a northward velocity and a southward
acceleration? Explain.
6. Can the velocity of an object be negative when its accel-
eration is positive? What about vice versa? If yes, give
examples in each case.
7. Give an example where both the velocity and acceleration
are negative.
8. Can an object be increasing in speed as its acceleration
decreases? If so, give an example. If not, explain.
9. Two cars emerge side by side from a tunnel. Car A is trav-
eling with a speed of 
and has an acceleration of
Car B has a speed of 
and has an
acceleration of 
Which car is passing the other
as they come out of the tunnel? Explain your reasoning.
10. A baseball player hits a ball straight up into the air. It
leaves the bat with a speed of 
In the absence of
air resistance, how fast would the ball be traveling when it is
caught at the same height above the ground as it left the
bat? Explain.
