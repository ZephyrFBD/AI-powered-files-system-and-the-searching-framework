You have just read about two pathways Introduce glucose catabolism—glycolysis and the citric acid cycle—that generate
ATP. Most of the ATP generated during the aerobic catabolism of glucose, however, is not generated directly from these

pathways. Rather, it is derived from a process that begins with moving electrons through a series of electron transporters
that undergo redox reactions. This causes hydrogen ions to accumulate within the matrix space. Therefore, a concentration
gradient forms in which hydrogen ions diffuse out of the matrix space by passing through ATP synthase. The current of
hydrogen ions powers the catalytic action of ATP synthase, which phosphorylates ADP, producing ATP.
Electron Transport Chain
The electron transport chain (Figure 7.11) is the last component of aerobic respiration and is the only part of glucose
metabolism th
