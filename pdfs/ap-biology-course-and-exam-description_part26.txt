ications that can overburden the course. 
Illustrative examples are provided that offer you a 
variety of optional instructional contexts to help your 
students achieve deeper understanding. Content  
that is outside the scope of the course and exam is 
also identified.
This framework encourages student development 
of inquiry and reasoning skills, such as designing 
a plan for collecting data, analyzing data, applying 
mathematical routines, and justifying arguments 
using evidence. The result will be readiness for the 
study of advanced topics in subsequent college 
courses—a goal of every AP course.
