formance to
be, assuming all else stays the same?
APPROACH We use the definitions of coefficient of performance, which are
different for the two devices in (a) and (b).
SOLUTION (a) We use Eq. 15–7 for the heat pump, and, since our device does
1500 J of work per second, it can pour heat into the room at a rate of
per second, or at a rate of 4500 W.
(b) If our device is turned around in summer, it can take heat 
from inside the
house, doing 1500 J of work per second to then dump
per second
to the hot outside. Energy is conserved, so
(see Fig. 15–18, but
reverse the inside and outside of the house). Then
The coefficient of performance as an air conditioner would thus be (Eq. 15–6a)
NOTE The coefficients of performance are defined differently for heat pumps
and air conditioners.
COP = QL
W
= 3000 J
1500 J = 2.0.
QL = QH - W = 4500 J - 1500 J = 3000 J.
QL + W = QH
QH = 4500 J
QL
[L 4 Btus.]
QH = COP * W = 3.0 * 1500 J = 4500 J
