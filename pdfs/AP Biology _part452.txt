Habitat isolation: Two organisms live in the same area but
encounter each other rarely. Two species of one genus of snake can
be found in the same geographic area, but one inhabits the water
while the other is mainly terrestrial.
Behavioral isolation: Sticklebacks, small saltwater fish that have
been studied extensively, have elaborate mating behavior. At
breeding time, in response to increased sunlight, the males change
in color and develop a red underbelly. The male builds a nest and

Male fireflies of various species signal to females of their kind
by blinking the lights on their tails in a particular pattern. Females
respond only to characteristics of their own species, flashing back
to attract males. If, for any reason, the female does not respond w
