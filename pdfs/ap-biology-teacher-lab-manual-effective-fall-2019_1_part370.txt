 step to master. Once you learn to do this, you will 
be able to complete the entire exercise successfully. Create the vacuum by holding 
a finger over the narrow syringe opening while drawing back the plunger (see 
Figure 6a). Hold this vacuum for about 10 seconds. While holding the vacuum, 
swirl the leaf disks to suspend them in the solution. Now release the vacuum 
by letting the plunger spring back. The solution will infiltrate the air spaces in 
the leaf disk, causing the leaf disks to sink in the syringe. If the plunger does 
not spring back, you did not have a good vacuum, and you may need a different 
syringe. You may have to repeat this procedure two to three times in order to 
get the disks to sink. (If you have any difficulty getting your disks to sink after 
three tries, it is usually because there is not enough soap in the solution. Try 
adding a few more drops of soap to the cup and replacing the liquid in the 
syringe.) Placing the disks under vacuum more than three tim
