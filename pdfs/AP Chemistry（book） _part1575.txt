Which gas deviates most from ideal behavior?
In deriving the ideal-gas equation, we make two assumptions:
• the molecules of an ideal gas do not interact with one another,
•  
the combined volume of the molecules is much smaller than the volume the gas 
occupies.
For these reasons, we consider the molecules as taking up no space in the container. In 
many cases, the small error introduced by these assumptions is acceptable. If more accu-
rate calculations are needed, we can correct for the assumptions if we know something 
about the attraction molecules have for one another and the size of the molecules.
The term R in the ideal-gas equation is the gas constant. The value and units of R 
depend on the units of P, V, n, and T. The value for T in the ideal-gas equation must always 
be the absolute temperature (in kelvins instead of degrees Celsius). The quantity of gas, n, 
is normally expressed in moles. The units chosen for pressure and volume are most often 
atmospheres and lite
