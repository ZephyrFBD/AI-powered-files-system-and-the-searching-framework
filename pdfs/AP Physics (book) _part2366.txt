 the induced emf?
RESPONSE (a) From Lenz’s law we know that the induced emf must oppose
the change in magnetic flux. If the current is increasing, so is the magnetic flux.
The induced emf acts to oppose the increasing flux, which means it acts like a
source of emf that opposes the outside source of emf driving the current. So 
the induced emf in the coil acts to oppose I in Fig. 21–36a. In other words, the
inductor might be thought of as a battery with a positive terminal at point A
(tending to block the current entering at A), and negative at point B.
(b) If the current is decreasing, then by Lenz’s law the induced emf acts to
bolster the flux—like a source of emf reinforcing the external emf. The induced
emf acts to increase I in Fig. 21–36b, so in this situation you can think of the
induced emf as a battery with its negative terminal at point A to attract more
current (conventional,
) to move to the right.
