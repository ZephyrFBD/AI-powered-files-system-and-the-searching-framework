lane of the px orbital. (a) Determine 
the nodal plane of the pz orbital. (b) What are the two nodal 
planes of the dxy  
orbital? (c) What are the two nodal planes of 
the dx2 - y2 orbital?
[6.100] The Chemistry and Life box in Section 6.7 described the tech-
niques called NMR and MRI. (a) Instruments for obtaining 
MRI data are typically labeled with a frequency, such as 600 
MHz. In what region of the electromagnetic spectrum does 
a photon with this frequency belong? (b) What is the value 
of ∆E in Figure 6.27 that would correspond to the absorption 
of a photon of radiation with frequency 450 MHz? (c) When 
the 450-MHz photon is absorbed, does it change the spin of 
the electron or the proton on a hydrogen atom?
 
[6.101] Suppose that the spin quantum number, ms, could have 
three allowed values instead of two. How would this affect 
the number of elements in the ﬁrst four rows of the periodic 
table?
