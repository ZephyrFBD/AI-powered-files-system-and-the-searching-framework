This reaction is the first step in the Ostwald process, by which NH3 is converted com-
mercially into nitric acid 1HNO32.
When exposed to air, nitric oxide reacts readily with O2 (Figure 22.23):
 
2 NO1g2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 NO21g2 
[22.38]
When dissolved in water, NO2 forms nitric acid:
 
3 NO21g2 + H2O1l2 ¡ 2 H+1aq2 + 2 NO3
-1aq2 + NO1g2 
[22.39]
Nitrogen is both oxidized and reduced in this reaction, which means it disproportionates. 
The NO can be converted back into NO2 by exposure to air (Equation 22.38) and thereaf-
ter dissolved in water to prepare more HNO3.
NO is an important neurotransmitter in the human body. It causes the muscles that 
line blood vessels to relax, thus allowing an increased passage of blood (see “Chemistry 
and Life: Nitroglycerin, Nitric Oxide, and Heart Disease”).
Nitrogen dioxide 1NO22 is a yellow-brown gas (Figure 22.23). Like NO, it is a major con-
stituent of smog. 
 (Section 18.2) It is poisonous and has a choking odor. As discussed
