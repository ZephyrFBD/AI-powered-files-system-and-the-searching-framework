31. How can squamous epithelia, which have a high
surface area-to-volume ratio, both facilitate diffusion and
prevent damage from abrasion?
a.
Single layers of squamous epithelia facilitate
gas, nutrient or waste exchange, whereas
stratified layers provide protection but are not
replaceable following damage.
b.
Stratified layers of squamous epithelia facilitate
gas, nutrient or waste exchange, whereas single
layers provide protection and are replaceable
following damage.
c.
Single layers of squamous epithelia facilitate
gas, nutrient or waste exchange whereas
stratified layers provide protection and are
replaceable following damage.
d.
Single layers of squamous epithelia facilitate
only exchange of gases by diffusion, whereas
stratified layers provide protection and are
replaceable follow
