h their new baby, Maisie. He 
 
 holds her bottle and sings, 
 
 Clap hands, clap hands, 
 
 Till Daddy comes home, 
 
 With buns in his pocket 
 
 For Maisie alone. 
 
 Clap hands, clap hands, 
 
 Till Daddy comes home, 
 
 For Daddy has money 
 
 And Mammy has none. 
 
 Malachy tries to sing that song but I tell him stop, it’s Maisie’s song. 
 
 He starts to cry and Minnie says,There, there.You can sing the song. 
 
 That’s a song for all the children. Mr. MacAdorey smiles at Malachy 
 
 and I wonder what kind of world is it where anyone can sing anyone 
 
 else’s song. 
 
 Minnie says, Don’t frown, Frankie. It makes your face dark and God 
 
 knows it’s dark enough. Some day you’ll have a little sister and you can 
 
 sing that song to her. Och, aye.You’ll have a little sister, surely. 
 
 Minnie is right and Mam gets her wish.There’s a new baby soon, a little 
 
  
  
 girl, and they call her Margaret.We all love Margaret. She has black 
 
 curly hair and blue eyes like Mam and she
