 membranes of neighboring plant cells cannot touch one another because they are
separated by the cell wall that surrounds each cell (Figure 4.8b). How then, can a plant transfer water and other soil nutrients
from its roots, through its stems, and to its leaves? Such transport uses the vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) primarily.
There also exist structural modifications called plasmodesmata (singular = plasmodesma), numerous channels that pass
between cell walls of adjacent plant cells, connect their cytoplasm, and enable materials to be transported from cell to cell,
and thus throughout the plant (Figure 4.28).

Figure 4.28 A plasmodesma is a channel between the cell walls of two adjacent plant cells. Plasmodesmata allow
materials to pass from the cytoplasm of one plant cell to the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell.
Tight Junctions
A tight junction is a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells (Figure 4.29). The cells are held tightly against each
