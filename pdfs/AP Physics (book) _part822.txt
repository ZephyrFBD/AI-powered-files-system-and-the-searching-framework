 we
must use the distance from the axis of rotation that is perpendicular to the line of
action of the force (Fig. 8–13a).
An equivalent way of determining the torque associated with a force is to
resolve the force into components parallel and perpendicular to the line that con-
nects the axis to the point of application of the force, as shown in Fig. 8–13b. The
component 
exerts no torque since it is directed at the rotation axis (its lever
arm is zero). Hence the torque will be equal to 
times the distance r from the
axis to the point of application of the force:
(8;10b)
This gives the same result as Eq. 8–10a because 
and 
Thus
(8;10c)
in either case. [Note that is the angle between the directions of 
and r (radial
line from the axis to the point where 
acts).] We can use any of Eqs. 8–10 to 
calculate the torque, whichever is easiest.
Because torque is a distance times a force, it is measured in units of 
in
SI units,†
in the cgs system, and 
in the English system.
