Theodor Engelmann carried out a now famous experiment in 1883
to determine which wavelengths of light are most important for
photosynthesis to occur in green plants. He placed a single strand of
the green algae Spirogyra on a microscope slide along with a drop of
water containing aerobic (oxygen-requiring) bacteria. At first, the
bacteria distributed themselves ran
