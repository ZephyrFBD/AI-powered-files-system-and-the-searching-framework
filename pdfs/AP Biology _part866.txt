uestion told us to assume that each bacterium took up the
plasmid it was exposed to. Therefore, the bacteria in culture A took
up the plasmid that is resistant to ampicillin, and the bacteria in
culture B took up the plasmid that is resistant to tetracycline.
Bacteria A are resistant to ampicillin and can thus grow on plates I
and III. Bacteria B are resistant to tetracycline and can thus grow on
plates II and III. No bacteria can grow on plate IV, and both can
grow on plate III. (SP 3)
(C) If approximately 84% of the population show the dominant trait,
then 16% show the recessive phenotype and are homozygous
recessive. Therefore, the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.4, and
the frequency of the dominant allele is 0.6. The frequency of the
hybrid in the Hardy-Weinberg equation is 2pq: 2(0.6 Ã— 0.4) = .48 =
48%. (SP 5)
(C) The frequency of a dominant allele is p; the frequency of a
recessive allele is q. If the dominant phenotype appears 91% of the
time, then the recessive phenotype
