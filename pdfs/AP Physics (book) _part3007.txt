he wave theory makes the following predictions:
1. If the light intensity is increased, the number of electrons ejected and their
maximum kinetic energy should be increased because the higher intensity
means a greater electric field amplitude, and the greater electric field should
eject electrons with higher speed.
2. The frequency of the light should not affect the kinetic energy of the ejected
electrons. Only the intensity should affect 
The photon theory makes completely different predictions. First we note that
in a monochromatic beam, all photons have the same energy 
Increasing
the intensity of the light beam means increasing the number of photons in the
beam, but does not affect the energy of each photon as long as the frequency is
not changed. According to Einsteinâ€™s theory, an electron is ejected from the metal
by a collision with a single photon. In the process, all the photon energy is trans-
ferred to the electron and the photon ceases to exist. Since electrons are held in
