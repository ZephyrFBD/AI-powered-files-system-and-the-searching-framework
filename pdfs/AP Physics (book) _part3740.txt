The intensity of this CMB measured at 
corresponds to black-
body radiation (see Section 27–2) at a temperature of about 3 K. When radiation
at other wavelengths was measured by the COBE satellite (COsmic Background
Explorer), the intensities were found to fall on a nearly perfect blackbody curve
as shown in Fig. 33–24, corresponding to a temperature of 2.725 K 
.
The remarkable uniformity of the CMB was in accordance with the
cosmological principle. But theorists felt that there needed to be some small
inhomogeneities, or “anisotropies,” in the CMB that would have provided
“seeds” at which galaxy formation could have started. Small areas of slightly
higher density, which could have contracted under gravity to form clusters of
galaxies, were indeed found. Thes
