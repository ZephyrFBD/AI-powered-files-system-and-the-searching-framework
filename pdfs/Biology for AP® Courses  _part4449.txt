ity (geotaxis) and can be directed
toward (positive) or away (negative) from the source of the stimulus. An example of a positive chemotaxis is exhibited by
the unicellular protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. This organism swims using its cilia, at times moving in a straight line,
and at other times making turns. The attracting chemotactic agent alters the frequency of turning as the organism moves
directly toward the source, following the increasing concentration gradient.
Fixed Action Patterns
A fixed action pattern is a series of movements elicited by a stimulus such that even when the stimulus is removed, the
pattern goes on to completion. An example of such a behavior occurs in the three-spined stickleback, a small freshwater
fish (Figure 36.35). Males of this species develop a red belly during breeding season and show instinctual aggressiveness
to other males during this time. In laboratory experiments, researchers exposed such fish to objects that in no way resemble
a fish in the
