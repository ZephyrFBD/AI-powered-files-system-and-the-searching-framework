ology exam,
it is an important and timely topic, so a brief discussion of CRISPR is included here.
CRISPR can be used to edit DNA sequences. The Cas9 enzyme uses a piece of guide RNA to find where to cut
DNA. By using synthetic guide RNA pieces that correspond to the desired location of the cut to be made, one can
direct the Cas9 enzyme to cut at a specific DNA sequence. If this cut is in the middle of a gene or one of its
regulatory regions, this can create a “knockout” of the gene in which the gene is no longer functional. Observing the
effects of this knockout can help scientists understand the function of that gene.
Sometimes instead of a knockout, a different DNA sequence at the site cut by the Cas9 enzyme is desired.
Inserting multiple copies of a donor DNA sequence into the cell allows the cell’s own DNA repair mechanisms to
use the donor DNA as a template. The cell can then replace the DNA sequence at the cut site with a copy of the
donor sequence.
