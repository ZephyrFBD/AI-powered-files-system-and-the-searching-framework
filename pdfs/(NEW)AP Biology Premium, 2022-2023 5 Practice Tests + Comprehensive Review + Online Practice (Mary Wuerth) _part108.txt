Overview
In prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (no matter the size), the basic unit of life is the cell. This chapter reviews
the functions of different parts of the cell and how cells maintain an internal environment (homeostasis) that
supports life.
Cell Organelles and Their Functions
The two major types of cells are prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. (See Figure 5.1.) Prokaryotic cells are
simpler in structure. Bacteria are prokaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles and are
much more complex than prokaryotic cells. Animals, plants, fungi, and protists are all composed of eukaryotic cells.
All cells (both prokaryotic and eukaryotic) contain genetic material, ribosomes, cytosol, and a plasma
