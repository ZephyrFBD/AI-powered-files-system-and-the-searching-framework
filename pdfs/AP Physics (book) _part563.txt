urn’s own rotation period of 10 hours and 39 minutes.
The mass of Saturn is
80. During an Apollo lunar landing mission, the command
module continued to orbit the Moon at an altitude of about
100 km. How long did it take to go around the Moon once?
81. The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) utilizes a
group of 24 satellites orbiting the Earth. Using “triang-
ulation” and signals transmitted by these satellites, the
position of a receiver on the Earth can be determined to
within an accuracy of a few centimeters. The satellite orbits
are distributed around the Earth, allowing continuous
navigational “fixes.” The satellites orbit at an altitude
of approximately 11,000 nautical miles  [1 nautical mile

satellite. (b) Determine the period of each satellite.
82. The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft,
after traveling 2.1 billion km, is meant to orbit the asteroid
Eros with an orbital radius of about 20 km. Eros is
