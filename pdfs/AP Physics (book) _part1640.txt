urn to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 412, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.
If the second law were not true, so that a perfect engine could be built, rather
remarkable things could happen. For example, if the engine of a ship did not
need a low-temperature reservoir to exhaust heat into, the ship could sail across
the ocean using the vast resources of the internal energy of the ocean water.
Indeed, we would have no fuel problems at all!
The coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigerator is defined as the 
heat 
removed from the low-temperature area (inside a refrigerator) divided
by the work W done to remove the heat (Fig. 15â€“16):
(15;6a)
We use 
because it is the heat removed from inside that matters from a practical
point of view. This makes sense because the more heat
that can be removed
from inside the refrigerator for a given amount of work, the better (more efficient)
the refrigerator is. Energy is conserved, so
