One final note: the motion of particles and objects in rotating frames of 
reference is extremely interesting, though a bit advanced and so is treated at the
end of the book in Appendix C.

Summary

When a rigid object rotates about a fixed axis, each point of the
object moves in a circular path. Lines drawn perpendicularly
from the rotation axis to various points in the object all sweep
out the same angle in any given time interval.
Angles are conventionally measured in radians, where one
radian is the angle subtended by an arc whose length is equal
to the radius, or
Ang
