anobacteria, and others) are Gram-negative. The Gram staining method is named after its inventor, Danish
scientist Hans Christian Gram (1853â€“1938). The different bacterial responses to the staining procedure are ultimately due to
cell wall structure. Gram-positive organisms typically lack the outer membrane found in Gram-negative organisms (Figure
22.15). Up to 90 percent of the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan, and most of the rest
is composed of acidic substances called teichoic acids. Teichoic acids may be covalently linked to lipids in the plasma
membrane to form lipoteichoic acids. Lipoteichoic acids anchor the cell wall to the cell membrane. Gram-negative bacteria
have a relatively thin cell wall composed of a few layers of peptidoglycan (only 10 percent of the total cell wall), surrounded
by an outer envelope containing lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and lipoproteins. This outer envelope is sometimes referred to as
a second lipid bilayer. The chemistry
