tree, which shows degrees of relatedness without necessarily
oﬀering information about the ancestral relationships between
species or the timescale of divergences.

Phylogenetic trees and cladograms can show anagenetic
evolutionary changes (which do not lead to speciation), as well
as cladogenetic evolutionary changes (which do).

1. The figure below shows a recent reptile cladogram developed
using molecular, morphological, and paleontological data. The
Gekkota, Anguimorpha, Scincidae, Teiidae, and Iguania are lizard
groups. The Mosasauria is a group of extinct marine reptiles. The
Serpentes are the snakes.
Which of the following statements is best supported by the
cladogram?

The snakes are more closely related to the Iguania than to
the Gekkota.
