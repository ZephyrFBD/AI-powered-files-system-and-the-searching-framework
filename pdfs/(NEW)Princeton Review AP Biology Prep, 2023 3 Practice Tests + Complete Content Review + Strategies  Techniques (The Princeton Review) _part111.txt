ferent based on confidence intervals or error bars, and you may be asked to perform chi-
square statistics. While Argumentation questions also ask you to support claims with evidence, Statistical Tests &
Data Analysis questions will focus more on the data than the scientific principles and theories behind the data.
The most obvious feature of Statistical Tests & Data Analysis questions is the associated numerical data and

In case you were curious, the answers to the questions modeled on these
