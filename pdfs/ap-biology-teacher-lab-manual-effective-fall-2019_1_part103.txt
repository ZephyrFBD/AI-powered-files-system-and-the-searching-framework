ypes. How are these patterns inherited? 
In a classic study, Steven C. Anderson and E. Peter Volpe (Anderson and Volpe 1958) 
reported the results from experiments to determine how skin pattern is inherited in 
leopard frogs. 
The segregation observed in the progeny of the cross, kandiyohi female x burnsi 
 
male, was 15 kandiyohi, 11 burnsi, 10 pipiens, and 14 mottled burnsi (see Figure 5). 
The reciprocal cross, burnsi female x kandiyohi male, yielded 10 kandiyohi, 7 burnsi, 8 
pipiens, and 5 mottled burnsi (see Figure 6). Neither of these ratios differs significantly

from 1:1:1:1 (p>0.70 in the former, p>0.50 in the latter). The results are interpretable on 
the basis that the parental kandiyohi and burnsi frogs in each cross were heterozygous. 
The p-values were calculated from a chi-square test for goodness of fit. 
What is the underlying genetic causal model? There are actually two hypotheses that 
could account for an observed ratio in the offspring of a
