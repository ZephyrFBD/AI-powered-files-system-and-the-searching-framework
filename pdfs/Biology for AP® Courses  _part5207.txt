omes from as we now have ﬁve diﬀerent sources of rich
genetic material in our mix?’ Remember, he says, that all genetic
material, whether from monkey kidney tissues, bovine serum, milk,
etc., is made from the exact same components. The same central
question returns: ‘How are you possibly going to know that it was
the virus that killed the kidney tissue and not the toxic antibiotic and
starvation rations on which you are growing the tissue?’ John Enders
answered the question himself – you can’t:
A second agent was obtained from an uninoculated culture of monkey kidney cells. The
cytopathic changes [death of the cells] it induced in the unstained preparations could not be
distinguished with confidence from the viruses isolated from measles.
The death of the cells (‘cytopathic changes’) happened in exactly
the same manner, whether they inoculated the kidney tissue with the
measles snot or not, Cowan says. ‘This is evidence that the
destruction of the tissue, the very proof of viral causat
