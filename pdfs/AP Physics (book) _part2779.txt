e lens
to be at least that good.
SOLUTION We can either take the image height (3000 pixels in 24 mm) or the
width (4000 pixels in 32 mm):
We would like the lens to match this resolution of 125 lines or dots per mm,
which would be a quite good lens. If the lens is not this good, fewer pixels and
less memory could be used.
NOTE Increasing lens resolution is a tougher problem today than is squeezing
more pixels on a CCD or CMOS sensor. The sensor for high quality cameras
must also be physically larger for better image accuracy and greater light
sensitivity in low light conditions.
