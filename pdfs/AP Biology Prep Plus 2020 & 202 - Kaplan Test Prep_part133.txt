d in protein production (translation) and are
synthesized in the nucleolus. They consist of two subunits, one large and
one small. Each ribosomal subunit is composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
and many proteins. Free ribosomes are found in the cytoplasm, while
bound ribosomes line the outer membrane of the endoplasmic
reticulum. Proteins that are destined for the cytoplasm are synthesized
by ribosomes free in the cytoplasm, while proteins that are bound for one
of the several membranes or that are to be secreted from the cell are
translated on ribosomes bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
Prokaryotic ribosomes are similar to those of eukaryotes, composed of
rRNA and proteins that form two diï¬€erent size subunits that come
together to perform DNA synthesis. Prokaryotic ribosomes are, however,
smaller and simpler than eukaryotic ribosomes. Mitochondria and
chloroplasts also have their own ribosomes, which are distinct from
those of the eukaryotic cytoplasm and more closely resemble
pro
