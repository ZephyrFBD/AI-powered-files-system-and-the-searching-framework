(Section 11.2)
ionic bond A bond formed by the electrostatic attractions 
between oppositely charged ions. The ions are formed from 
atoms by transfer of one or more electrons. (Chapter 8: 
Introduction)
ionic compound A compound composed of cations and anions. 
(Section 2.7)
ionic hydrides Compounds formed when hydrogen reacts with 
alkali metals and also the heavier alkaline earths (Ca, Sr, and Ba); 
these compounds contain the hydride ion, H-. (Section 22.2)
ionic solids Solids that are held together by the mutual 
electrostatic attraction between cations and anions. (Sections 
12.1 and 12.5)
ionization energy The minimum energy required to remove an 
electron from the ground state of an isolated gaseous atom or 
ion. (Section 7.4)
ionizing radiation Radiation that has sufficient energy to remove 
an electron from a molecule, thereby ionizing it. (Section 21.9)
ion-product constant For water, Kw is the product of the 
aquated hydrogen ion and hydroxide ion concentrations: 
3H+43OH-4
