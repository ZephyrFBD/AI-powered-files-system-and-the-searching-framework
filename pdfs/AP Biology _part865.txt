(C) NaHCO3 is the source of CO2 for photosynthesis. As
photosynthesis occurs, this CO2 from the air spaces in the leaves is
used up and replaced by bubbles of oxygen. This oxygen rises
upward in the beaker, carrying the leaves with it. While it is correct
that the test for the presence of oxygen is a glowing splint that bursts
into flames, you did not test for the presence of oxygen in this
experiment. You inferred oxygenâ€™s presence. The leaves did not lose
mass because the CO2 was replaced by O2. (SP 3)
(B) If the gel is more concentrated, it will present more of an
impediment and separate the two bands more effectively. Another
method would be to lower the voltage and allow them to run very
slowly and overnight. One must simply try both techniques to see
which works better. (SP 6)
