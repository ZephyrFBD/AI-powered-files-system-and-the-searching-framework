 be expressed in offspring, but not in either
parent, because the parents are heterozygous carriers of the trait. Sex-linked recessive traits usually appear more
often in males than in females. Chapter 14 will discuss the patterns of inheritance seen in non-Mendelian traits.
Before practicing some genetics problems, review the following terms:
■Genotype—the genetic makeup or alleles for the trait in an organism (i.e., AA or Aa or aa)
■Phenotype—the physical expression of the genotype in an organism (i.e., purple flowers or white flowers)
■Homozygous—having two copies of the same allele for a trait (i.e., AA or aa)
■Heterozygous—having two different alleles for a trait (i.e., Aa); Mendel referred to this as “hybrid”
■Dominant—requires only one copy of the allele for the trait to be expressed in the phenotype; dominant
traits are those that are expressed in organisms that are heterozygous
■Recessive—requires two copies of the allele for the trait to be expressed in the phenotype; recessi
