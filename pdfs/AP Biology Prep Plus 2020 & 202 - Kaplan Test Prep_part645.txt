Based on the information in the tables, how could the researchers
best design their mutation protocol?
Researchers should use the highest possible EMS dose to
reduce the mutation rate to a manageable amount and then
begin by examining splicing mutations to determine whether
any produce new enzymes that improve melon quality.
(A)
Researchers should use the highest possible EMS dose and
then begin by examining the silent mutations to determine
whether any are associated with improved melon quality.
(B)
Researchers should use a relatively low EMS dose and then
begin by examining the missense mutations to determine
whether any are associated with improved melon quality.
(C)
Researchers should use a relatively low EMS dose and then
begin by examining the nonsense mutations to determine
whether any produce new enzymes that improve melon
quality.

2. Human ABO blood types are inherited through a codominant
pattern of inheritance. The possible blood types include A, B, AB,
and O
