h its environment. This is true whether it is a unicellular organism or one
of many cells forming a larger organism. In order to respond to external stimuli, cells have developed complex mechanisms
of communication that can receive a message, transfer the information across the plasma membrane, and produce changes
within the cell in response to the message. In multicellular organisms, cells send and receive chemical messages constantly
to coordinate the actions of distant organs, tissues, and cells.
While the necessity for cellular communication in larger organisms seems obvious, even single-celled organisms
communicate with each other. Yeast cells signal each other to aid in mating. Some forms of bacteria coordinate their actions
in order to form large complexes called biofilms (Figure 9.18) or to organize the production of toxins to remove competing
organisms. The ability of cells to communicate through chemical signals originated in single cells and was essential for the
