other change occurring at higher temperatures is the skewing of molecular speeds 
toward higher values (Figure 10.13(a)). The expansion of the range of speeds leads to 
increased kinetic energy and increased disorder and, hence, increased entropy. The con-
clusions we reach in examining Figure 10.13 are consistent with what we noted earlier: 
Entropy generally increases with increasing temperature because the increased motional 
energy leads to a greater number of possible microstates.
Entropy versus temperature graphs such as Figure 19.12 can be obtained by carefully 
measuring how the heat capacity of a substance 
 (Section 5.5) varies with tempera-
ture, and we can use the data to obtain the absolute entropies at different temperatures. 
(The theory and methods used for these measurements and calculations are beyond the 
scope of this text.) Entropies are usually tabulated as molar quantities, in units of joules 
per mole-kelvin 1J>mol@K2.
