 ionized. How will their positions on the
film of a mass spectrometer (Fig. 20–41) differ? Explain.
*24. Why will either pole of a magnet attract an unmagnetized
piece of iron?
*25. An unmagnetized nail will not attract an unmagnetized
paper clip. However, if one end of the nail is in contact with
a magnet, the other end will attract a paper clip. Explain.

MisConceptual Question 9.
7. Which of the following statements is false? The magnetic
field of a current-carrying wire
(a) is directed circularly around the wire.
(b) decreases inversely with the distance from the wire.
(c) exists only if the current in the wire is changing.
(d) depends on the magnitude of the current.
8. A wire carries a current directly away from you. Which way
do the magnetic field lines produced by this wire point?

current.
(b) They point parallel to the wire opposite the direction
of the current.
(c) They point toward the wire.
