ving obstacle, the frequency of the
reflected wave will, because of the Doppler effect, be different from that of the inci-
dent wave. This is illustrated in the following Example.

FIGURE 12–22 Example 12–16.
Two Doppler shifts. A 5000-Hz sound wave is emitted 
by a stationary source. This sound wave reflects from an object moving 
toward the source (Fig. 12–22). What is the frequency of the wave reflected by
the moving object as detected by a detector at rest near the source?
APPROACH There are actually two Doppler shifts in this situation. First, the
moving object acts like an observer moving toward the source with speed
(Fig. 12–22a) and so “detects” a sound wave of frequency
(Eq. 12–3a)
Second
