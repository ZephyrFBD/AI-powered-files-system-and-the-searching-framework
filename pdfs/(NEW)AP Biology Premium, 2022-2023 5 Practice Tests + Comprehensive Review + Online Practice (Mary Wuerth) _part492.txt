s increased over time.
(d) If there are far fewer D. ingens in this area, there will be fewer burrows for the lizard species to occupy and
the diversity of the lizard species in the area will decrease.

Overview
The evolutionary history of life is driven by speciation and extinction. This chapter will review how scientists trace
the evolutionary history of a species, the processes that lead to speciation and extinction, and modern-day examples
of continuing evolution of species.
Phylogeny and Common Ancestry
Phylogeny is the history of the evolution of a species or group. Phylogeny shows lines of ancestry, common
descent, and relationships among groups of organisms. Phylogenetic trees and cladograms are hypotheses about
the history of evolution over time, with phylogenetic trees indicating th
