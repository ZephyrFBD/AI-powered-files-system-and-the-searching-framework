†A breeder reactor does not produce more fuel than it uses.

Fukushima, Japan, after the nuclear
power plant meltdown in 2011.
The energy released in the fission process appears as heat, which is used to boil
water and produce steam to drive a turbine connected to an electric generator
(Fig. 31–8). The core of a nuclear reactor consists of the fuel and a moderator
(water in most U.S. commercial reactors). The fuel is usually uranium enriched
so that it contains 2 to 4 percent 
Water at high pressure or other liquid (such
as liquid sodium) is allowed to flow through the core. The thermal energy it
absorbs is used to produce steam in the heat exchanger, so the
