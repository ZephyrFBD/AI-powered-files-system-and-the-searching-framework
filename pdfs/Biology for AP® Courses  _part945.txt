the same time, splitting of water adds protons to the lumen, and reduction of NADPH removes protons from the
stroma. The net result is a low pH in the thylakoid lumen, and a high pH in the stroma. ATP synthase uses this
electrochemical gradient to make ATP.
What is the external source of the electrons that ultimately pass through photosynthetic electron transport chains?
a.
carbon dioxide
b.
NADPH
c.
oxygen
d.
water
The reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules with a special property. Those two chlorophylls can undergo
oxidation upon excitation; they can actually give up an electron in a process called a photoact. It is at this step in the reaction
center, this step in photosynthesis, that light energy is converted into an excited electron. All of the subsequent steps involve
getting that electron onto the energy carrier NADPH for delivery to the Calvin cycle where the electron is deposited onto
carbon for long-term storage in the form of a carbohydrate.PSII an
