CHAPTER 15 Chemical Equilibrium
Chapter summary and Key Terms
THE CONCEPT OF EQUILIBRIUM (SECTION 15.1) A chemical 
reaction can achieve a state in which the forward and reverse pro-
cesses are occurring at the same rate. This condition is called chemical 
equilibrium, and it results in the formation of an equilibrium mixture 
of reactants and products. The composition of an equilibrium mix-
ture does not change with time if temperature is held constant.
THE EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANT (SECTION 15.2) An equilib-
rium that is used throughout this chapter is the reaction N21g2 +
3 H21g2 ∆ 2 NH31g2. This reaction is the basis of the Haber process 
for the production of ammonia. The relationship between the con-
centrations of the reactants and products of a system at equilibrium 
is given by the law of mass action. For an equilibrium equation of the 
form a A + b B ∆d D + e E, the equilibrium-cons
