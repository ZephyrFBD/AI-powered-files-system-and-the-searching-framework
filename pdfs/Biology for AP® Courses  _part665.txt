that same motionless wrecking ball is lifted two stories above a car with a crane? If the suspended wrecking
ball is unmoving, is there energy associated with it? The answer is yes. The suspended wrecking ball has energy associated
with it that is fundamentally different from the kinetic energy of objects in motion. This form of energy results from the
fact that there is the potential for the wrecking ball to do work. If it is released, indeed it would do work. Because this type
of energy refers to the potential to do work, it is called potential energy. Objects transfer their energy between kinetic and
potential in the following way: As the wrecking ball hangs motionless, it has 0 kinetic and 100 percent potential energy.
Once it is released, its kinetic energy begins to increase because it builds speed due to gravity. At the same time, as it nears
the ground, it loses potential energy. Somewhere mid-fall it has 50 percent kinetic and 50 percent potential energy. Just
