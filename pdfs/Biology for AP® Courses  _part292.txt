cules of water are released in the process.
During this ester bond formation, three water molecules are released. The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be
similar or dissimilar. Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure. Some fatty
acids have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the
palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea, the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts.
Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons
in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is said to be saturated. Saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen; in other
words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized. Stearic acid is an example of a saturated
fatty acid (Figure 3.15)
Figure 3.15 Stearic acid is a common saturated fatty acid.
