ins just after
the football loses contact with the foot until the ball reaches its maximum height.
During this time interval, the acceleration is g downward. At the maximum
height, the velocity is horizontal (Fig.3–23), so
This occurs at a time given
by
with
(see Eq. 2–11a in Table 3–2), so
and
From Eq. 2–11b, with
we can solve for y at this time 
:
The maximum height is 7.35 m. [Solving Eq. 2–11c for y gives the same result.]
(b) To find the time it takes for the ball to return to the ground, we consider a
different time interval, starting at the moment the ball leaves the foot  
and ending just before the ball touches the ground (
again).
We can use Eq. 2–11b with
and also set
(ground level):
This equation can be factored:
There are two solutions,
(which corresponds to the initial point,
), and
which is the total travel time of the football.
(c) The total distance traveled in the x direction is found by applying Eq. 2–11b
with
, and
:
