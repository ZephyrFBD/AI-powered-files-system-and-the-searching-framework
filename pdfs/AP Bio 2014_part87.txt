ation of birds on 
a remote island. Birds in the population are found 
to have either red crest feathers or white crest 
feathers on their heads. Genetic analysis indicates 
that the allele for red crest feathers is dominant 
over the allele for white crest feathers. In a survey 
of the population, the researchers determine the 
frequencies of the crest-feather phenotypes. The 
results of the survey are shown in the table below.

Assuming that the bird population is in Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium, what proportion of future 
populations is expected to be heterozygous for the 
allele controlling crest feather color? Give your 
answer as a value between 0 and 1, rounded to 
two decimal places.
