e cell would not undergo depolarization and
hyperpolarization, which are necessary to fire an
action potential and then return the cell to the
resting state.
23.
When an action potential is fired, what happens
immediately after the peak action potential occurs?
a.
Na+ channels open.
b.
K+ channels open.
c.
K+ channels close.
d.
Na+/K+ transporter restores resting potential.
24. Potassium channel blockers, such as amiodarone and
procainamide, which are used to treat abnormal electrical
activity in the heart, impede the movement of K+through
voltage-gated K+channels. Which part of the action
potential would potassium channels affect, and why?
a.
Depolarization after peak action potential would
be affected because that is the point when K+
begins to leave the cell.
b.
Repolarization after peak action potential would
be affected because that is the point when K+
begins to leave the cell.
c.
Repolarization after peak action potential would
be affected because that is the point when K+
begin
