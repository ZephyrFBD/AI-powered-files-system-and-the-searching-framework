46. The last part of the metamorphosis of a tadpole  
to an adult frog results in the disappearance of  
the tail. This stage of development most likely 
occurs by 
(A) cells of the tail dying and the nutrients being 
absorbed and reused by the body 
(B) shedding of the tail so energy is not spent  
on maintenance of an unneeded part 
(C) bilateral division of the tail and fusion with 
the developing hind limbs 
(D) individual cells of the tail migrating to the 
developing gonads

47. MRSA is the acronym for methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus. Many of the strains of the 
common bacterium are also resistant to other 
antibiotics in use today. The resistance is linked to 
a collection of genes carried on plasmids that are 
passed from one bacterium to another by 
conjugation. Suppose a newly
