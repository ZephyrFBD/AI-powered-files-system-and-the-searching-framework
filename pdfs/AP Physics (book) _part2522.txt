make as sharp an image as a plane mirror will. However, as we show below,
if the mirror is small compared to its radius of curvature, so that a reflected ray
makes only a small angle with the incident ray (
in Fig. 23–14), then the rays
will cross each other at very nearly a single point, or focus. In the case shown in
Fig. 23–14, the incoming rays are parallel to the principal axis, which is defined 
as the straight line perpendicular to the curved surface at its center (line CA in
Fig. 23–14). The point F, where incident parallel rays come to a focus after reflec-
tion, is called the focal point of the mirror. The distance between F and the center
of the mirror, length FA, is called the focal length, f, of the mirror. The focal
point is also the image point for an object infinitely far away along the principal
axis. The image of the Sun, for example, would be at F.
