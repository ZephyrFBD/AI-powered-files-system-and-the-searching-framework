n of the egg is called the
vegetal pole. The top half of the egg is called the animal pole and has a
pigmented cap. The animal-vegetal asymmetry dictates where the
anterior-posterior axis forms in the embryo. Eggs are laid directly into
water and fertilization is external. When the sperm penetrates the egg, the
pigmented cap rotates toward the point of penetration and a gray crescent
appears on the side opposite the point of entry of the sperm. The gray
crescent is a marker of the future dorsal side and is critical to normal
development of the growing embryo. (See “The Gray Crescent” on page
397.)

is uneven. The blastopore forms at the border of the gray crescent and the
vegetal pole. Cells at the dorsal lip above (dorsal to) the blastopore begin
to stream over the dorsal lip and into the blastopore in a process called
involution. As these ectoderm cells stream inward by wh
