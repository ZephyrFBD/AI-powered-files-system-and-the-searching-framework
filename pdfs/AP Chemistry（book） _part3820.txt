burning of the gasoline should create a strong, smooth expan-
sion of gas, forcing the piston outward and imparting force along 
the driveshaft of the engine. If the gas burns too rapidly, the piston 
receives a single hard slam rather than a strong, smooth push. The 
result is a “knocking” or “pinging” sound and a reduction in the effi-
ciency with which energy produced by the combustion is converted 
to work.
The octane number of a gasoline is a measure of its resistance to 
knocking. Gasolines with high octane numbers burn more smoothly 
and are thus more effective fuels (Figure 24.6). Branched alkanes 
and aromatic hydrocarbons have higher octane numbers than 
straight-chain alkanes. The octane number of gasoline is obtained 
by comparing its knocking characteristics with those of isooctane 
 
(2,2,4-trimethylpentane) and heptane. Isooctane is assigned an 
octane number of 100, and heptane is assigned 0. Gasoline with the 
same knocking characteristics as a mixture of 91% isooctane
