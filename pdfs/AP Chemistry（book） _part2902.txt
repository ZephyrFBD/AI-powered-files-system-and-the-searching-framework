oxygen environments. Anaerobic bacteria, which ﬂourish in swamps 
and landﬁlls, near the roots of rice plants, and in the digestive systems 
of cows and other ruminant animals, produce methane (Figure 18.15). 
It also leaks into the atmosphere during natural-gas extraction and 
transport. It is estimated that about two-thirds of present-day meth-
ane emissions, which are increasing by about 1% per year, are related 
to human activities.
Methane has a half-life in the atmosphere of about 10 years, 
whereas CO2 is much longer-lived. This might seem a good thing, 
but there are indirect effects to consider. Methane is oxidized in the 
stratosphere, producing water vapor, a powerful greenhouse gas that 
is otherwise virtually absent from the stratosphere. In the tropo-
sphere, methane is attacked by reactive species such as OH radicals or 
nitrogen oxides, eventually producing other greenhouse gases, such 
as O3. It has been estimated that on a per-molecule level, the global 
warming po
