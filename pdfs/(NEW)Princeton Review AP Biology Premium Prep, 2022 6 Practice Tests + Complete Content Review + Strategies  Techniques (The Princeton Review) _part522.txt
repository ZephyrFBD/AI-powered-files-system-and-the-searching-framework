 it also does not
require energy. Movement of sodium ions by a voltage-gated ion channel, (B), is an example of facilitated
diffusion. Because the sodium ions are still undergoing diffusion from high to low concentrations without
the need of ATP, this does not represent a form of active transport.

Bacterial cells can be visualized using light microscopy. In fact, back in the 17th century, some of the
earliest studies using primitive microscopes recorded the shape and organization of bacteria. Choices (A),
(B), and (D) are incorrect because virus and cell organelle structures are too small to be observed using
light microscopy and require electron microscopy.

D
The cell wall is a structure that is present in bacteria but absent in animal cells. Consequently, this
structure is targeted by several leading classes of antibiotics and would be an effective target of
therapeutics against V. cholerae. Cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and ribosomes—(A), (B), and (C),
respectively—are all str
