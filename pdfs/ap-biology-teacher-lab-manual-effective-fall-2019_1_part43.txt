g, black-bellied fly will continue to make contributions to the scientific 
community and to student projects.
We begin our investigation with a few simple questions. What do you know about 
fruit flies? Have you seen fruit flies outside the lab and, if so, where? Describe where and 
when you have noted fruit flies.
Background is drawn from the elements of the 
curriculum framework. Background information 
explains how the lab provides opportunities for 
students to review, scaffold, and apply concepts.

Learning objectives indicate what 
students should know and be able to 
do as they conduct their laboratory 
investigations. In the Teacher Manual, 
the learning objectives come directly 
from the AP Biology Curriculum 
Framework. Each learning objective 
integrates science practices with 
specific concepts and enduring 
understandings outlined in the 
curriculum framework.
