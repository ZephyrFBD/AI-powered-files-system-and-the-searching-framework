sorted. The most frequent modification is the addition of short chains of sugar molecules. These newly modified proteins
and lipids are then tagged with phosphate groups or other small molecules so that they can be routed to their proper
destinations.
Finally, the modified and tagged proteins are packaged into secretory vesicles that bud from the trans face of the Golgi.
While some of these vesicles deposit their contents into other parts of the cell where they will be used, other secretory
vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents outside the cell.
In another example of form following function, cells that engage in a great deal of secretory activity (such as cells of the
salivary glands that secrete digestive enzymes or cells of the immune system that secrete antibodies) have an abundance of
Golgi.
In plant cells, the Golgi apparatus has the additional role of synthesizing polysaccharides, some of which are incorporated
into the cell wall and some of wh
