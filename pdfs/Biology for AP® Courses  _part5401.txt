compared with the work of the UK government’s reframing network
that includes the Behavioural Insights Team ‘nudge unit’ and
‘Covid’ reframing specialists at SPI-B. WikiLeaks described
Common Purpose long ago as ‘a hidden virus in our government

the EU, instead of to their own departments, which they then
undermine or subvert, the NHS [National Health Service] being an

NHS over ‘Covid’ and we have seen the same in every other major
