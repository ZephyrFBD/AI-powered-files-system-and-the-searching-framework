sils can be dated by a variety of methods. See the section
entitled “Half-Life.”
Morphological homologies provide evidence for evolution and
common ancestry, such as similarity of front limb bones in whales,
humans, and bats.
Biochemical similarities across all kingdoms provide evidence for
evolution and common ancestry. Examples include cytochrome c
and the fact that major features of the genetic code are shared by all
organisms.
Cladograms can be constructed to demonstrate common ancestry
and speciation using traits that are shared and derived. (See
Chapter 10.)
The rate of evolution can vary (gradualism versus punctuated
equilibrium). Evolution is rapid in times of stress, such as
peppered moths, bacterial antibiotic resistance, and insect DDT
resistance.
There are several hypotheses about the natural origin of life on
Earth: RNA World hypothesis, heterotroph hypothesis, theory
of endosymbiosis, the experiments of Miller and Urey, and so on.
