 mark be placed?
APPROACH The hydrometer will float in water if its density 
is less than
the density of water. The fraction of the hydrometer sub-
merged 
is equal to the density ratio 
SOLUTION The hydrometer has an overall density
Thus, when placed in water, it will come to equilibrium when 0.900 of its volume
is submerged. Since it is of uniform cross section,
of its length will be submerged. The specific gravity of water is defined to be
1.000, so the mark should be placed 22.5 cm from the weighted end.
NOTE Hydrometers can be used to measure the density of liquids like car
antifreeze coolant, car battery acid (a measure of its charge), wine fermenting
in casks, and many others.
