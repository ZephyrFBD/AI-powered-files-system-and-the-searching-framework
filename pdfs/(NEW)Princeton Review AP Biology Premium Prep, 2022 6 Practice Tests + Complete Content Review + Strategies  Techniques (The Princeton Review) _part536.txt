e, as genes cannot turn into other genes simply by being in a different cell
context.

C
If there are DNA/RNA fragments, then helicase, (A), is present and has opened the strands. RNA
primase, (D), is also present because RNA primers have been added. DNA polymerase, (B), must be
present because there are small chunks and long chunks. If there was not polymerase, then there wouldn’t
be small chunks because nothing new would be made. It is likely that DNA ligase, (C), is missing and
couldn’t attach the short Okazaki fragments and the longer leading strand fragments.
CHAPTER 10 DRILL: NATURAL SELECTION
1.
D
Mammals and cephalopods developed similar eye structures independently due to similar selective
pressures. This is an example of convergent evolution.
2.
B
The data provided show a transition toward one extreme (black) and away from another (white). This is
an example of directional selection.

B
Based on the data, the number of white-bodied pepper moths decreased between 1802 and
