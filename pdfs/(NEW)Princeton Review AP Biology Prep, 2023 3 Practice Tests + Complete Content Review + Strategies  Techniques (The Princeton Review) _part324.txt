abrador puppies notices that in his line a gene predisposing his dogs for white spots has
arisen. He believes the white spot allele is autosomal recessive, and he wants to prevent it from continuing in
his dogs. He sees that one of his female dogs, Speckle, has white spots, and he therefore assumes she is
homozygous for the gene. But he must determine which males in his pack are heterozygous to avoid breeding
them in the future. What is a reasonable plan?
(A) Stop breeding Speckle.
(B) Pair Speckle with a male with white spots.
(C) Perform a test cross of Speckle with a black Labrador male. If any pups are born with white spots, stop
breeding that male because he is heterozygous.
(D) Breed Speckle with a chocolate Labrador.
9. Which of the following is a reason why certain traits do not follow Mendelâ€™s Law of Independent Assortment?

(B) It applies only to eukaryotes.
(C) Certain traits are not completely dominant.
(D) Heterozygotes have
