ant roles in immunity. Platelets and plasma proteins function in normal blood clotting; alterations in the feedback
mechanism(s) that result in normal clotting can have deleterious effects, including hemophilia and stroke.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 and Big Idea 4
of the AP速 Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP速 exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
