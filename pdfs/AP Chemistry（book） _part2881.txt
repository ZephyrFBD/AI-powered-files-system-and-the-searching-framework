xtent in the natural, unpolluted 
atmosphere. They originate in the bacterial decay of organic matter, in volcanic gases, 
and from other sources listed in Table 18.2. The amount of these compounds released 
into the atmosphere worldwide from natural sources is about 24 * 1012 g per year, less 
than the amount from human activities, about 80 * 1012 g per year (principally related 
to combustion of fuels).
Sulfur compounds, chiefly sulfur dioxide, SO2, are among the most unpleasant and 
harmful of the common pollutant gases. Table 18.4 shows the concentrations of several 
pollutant gases in a typical urban environment (where by typical we mean one that is not 
particularly affected by smog). According to these data, the level of sulfur dioxide is 0.08 
ppm or higher about half the time. This concentration is considerably lower than that 
of other pollutants, notably carbon monoxide. Nevertheless, SO2 is regarded as the most 
serious health hazard among the pollutants shown, especially f
