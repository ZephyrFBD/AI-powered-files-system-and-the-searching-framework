se cells (which form a connective tissue)
convert the glucose to fat. In this way, glucose concentration decreases in the blood. When blood glucose reaches
normal concentrations, insulin secretion stops.
Alpha cells secrete glucagon. When the concentration of blood glucose drops (during exercise, for example), alpha
cells secrete glucagon into the blood. Glucagon stimulates the liver to release glucose. The glucose in the liver
originates from the breakdown of glycogen and the conversion of amino acids, lactic acid, and glycerol into glucose.
When blood glucose reaches normal concentrations, glucagon secretion stops.
Diabetes mellitus is a disease that occurs when blood glucose levels are sustained at higher than normal levels. One
cause of this is an autoimmune response that destroys beta cells. The second and much more common cause is the
inability of body cells to respond to insulin. This condition is associated with excess body weight and a lack of
adequate exercise. If left untrea
