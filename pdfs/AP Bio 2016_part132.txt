inserted a small fragment of human DNA into the pTET-KAN plasmid. Cultures of 
E. coli were transformed with the modified plasmid. The transformed bacterial cells were able to 
survive in the presence of tetracycline but were unable to 
survive in the presence of kanamycin. Draw an X on the 
plasmid template provided below to indicate where the 
human DNA fragment was most likely inserted. Justify 
your placement of the inserted human DNA. (2 points) 
 
Identification (1 point) 
• make an X in the area within the kan gene or 
kan promoter 
 
Justification (1 point) 
• They must not have had an intact kan 
gene/promoter  
• The human DNA disrupted the kan gene/promoter
