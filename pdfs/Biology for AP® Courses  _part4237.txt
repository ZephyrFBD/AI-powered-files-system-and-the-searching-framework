challenge for the plants and animals that inhabit estuaries. Many estuarine plant species are halophytes: plants that can
tolerate salty conditions. Halophytic plants are adapted to deal with the salinity resulting from saltwater on their roots or
from sea spray. In some halophytes, filters in the roots remove the salt from the water that the plant absorbs. Other plants are
able to pump oxygen into their roots. Animals, such as mussels and clams (phylum Mollusca), have developed behavioral
adaptations that expend a lot of energy to function in this rapidly changing environment. When these animals are exposed to
low salinity, they stop feeding, close their shells, and switch from aerobic respiration (in which they use gills) to anaerobic
respiration (a process that does not require oxygen). When high tide returns to the estuary, the salinity and oxygen content
of the water increases, and these animals open their shells, begin feeding, and return to aerobic res
