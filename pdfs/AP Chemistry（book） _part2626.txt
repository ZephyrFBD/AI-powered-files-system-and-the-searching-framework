Chapter Summary and Key Terms
ARRHENIUS ACIDS AND BASES (SECTION 16.1) Acids and 
bases were first recognized by the properties of their aqueous 
solutions. For example, acids turn litmus red, whereas bases turn 
litmus blue. Arrhenius recognized that the properties of acidic 
solutions are due to H+1aq2 ions and those of basic solutions are 
du
