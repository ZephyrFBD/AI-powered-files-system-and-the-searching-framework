em because it occurred a very long time ago, and presumably it just occurred
once. Importantly, biologists believe that the presence of life on Earth precludes the possibility that the events that led to
life on Earth can be repeated because the intermediate stages would immediately become food for existing living things.
However, once a mechanism of inheritance was in place in the form of a molecule like DNA either within a cell or pre-cell,
these entities would be subject to the principle of natural selection. More effective reproducers would increase in frequency
at the expense of inefficient reproducers. So while evolution does not explain the origin of life, it may have something to
say about some of the processes operating once pre-living entities acquired certain properties.
Organisms Evolve on Purpose
Statements such as “organisms evolve in response to a change in an environment” are quite common, but such statements
can lead to two types of misunderstandings. First, the statem
