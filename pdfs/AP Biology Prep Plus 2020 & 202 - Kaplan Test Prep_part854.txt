(C) is incorrect because non-Mendelian traits are also subject to

(B) If the drop in the lynx population levels was due to a lack of food,
providing the lynx with alternative food sources when the snowshoe
hare population falls should remove that eﬀect and prevent the
cycling. (A) is incorrect because a lack of cycling might simply be
caused by the fact that the animals are in enclosure. (C) is incorrect
because this experiment would not test th
