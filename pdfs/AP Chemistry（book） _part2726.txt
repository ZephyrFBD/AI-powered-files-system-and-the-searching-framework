 pH of the solution of a weak base is described 
in Section 16.7 and is shown in Sample Exercise 17.8.
4. After equivalence point (excess base): In this region, 3OH-4 from the reac-
tion of CH3COO- with water is negligible relative to 3OH-4 from the excess NaOH. 
Thus, the pH is determined by the concentration of OH- from the excess NaOH. The 
method for calculating pH in this region is therefore like that illustrated in Sample 
Exercise 17.7(b). Thus, the addition of 51.0 mL of 0.100 M NaOH to 50.0 mL of either 
0.100 M HCl or 0.100 M CH3COOH yields the same pH, 11.00. Notice by comparing 
Figures 17.7 and 17.9 that the titration curves for a strong acid and a weak acid are 
the same after the equivalence point.
Go Figure
If the acetic acid being titrated here were replaced by hydrochloric acid, 
would the amount of base needed to reach the equivalence point change? 
Would the pH at the equivalence point change?
