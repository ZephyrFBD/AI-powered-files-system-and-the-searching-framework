d membrane. If unsaturated fatty acids are compressed, the “kinks” in their tails
elbow adjacent phospholipid molecules away, maintaining some space between the phospholipid molecules. This “elbow
room” helps to maintain fluidity in the membrane at temperatures at which membranes with saturated fatty acid tails in
their phospholipids would “freeze” or solidify. The relative fluidity of the membrane is particularly important in a cold
environment. A cold environment tends to compress membranes composed largely of saturated fatty acids, making them
less fluid and more susceptible to rupturing. Many organisms (fish are one example) are capable of adapting to cold
environments by changing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in their membranes in response to the lowering of the
temperature.
