ree possible ‘hosts’ or models on which they can test.
The ﬁrst was humans. Exposure to humans was generally not done
for ethical reasons and has never been done with SARS-CoV-2 or any
coronavirus. The second possible host was animals. Cowan said that
forgeĴing for a moment that they never actually use puriﬁed virus
when exposing animals they do use solutions that they claim contain
the virus. Exposure to animals has been done with SARS-CoV-2 in
an experiment involving mice and this is what they found: None of
the wild (normal) mice got sick. In a group of genetically-modiﬁed
mice, a statistically insigniﬁcant number lost weight and had slightly
bristled fur, but they experienced nothing like the illness called
‘Covid-19’. Cowan said the third method – the one they mostly rely
on – is to inoculate solutions they say contain the virus onto a variety
of tissue cultures. This process had never been shown to kill tissue
unless the sample material was starved of nutrients and poisoned as
