 of the relative energy budget of the 4 kg
male Adélie penguin?
The threshold potential of a particular membrane measures –70 mV
at time zero. After 10 minutes, it measures –90 mV. What is the best
explanation for what has happened to the membrane?
It became depolarized.
The concentrations of Na+ and K+ became balanced.
The membrane became hyperpolarized.

The membrane became hypopolarized.
Changes in the membrane potential of a neuron occur because
neuronal membranes have gated ion channels that open and close in
response to various stimuli. For example, opening potassium ion
gated channels in a resting neuron increases the membrane’s
permeability to potassium ions (K+). The result is an increase in the
net diffusion of K+ out of the neuron, which results in a
hyperpolarized (more polarized) membrane.
Which of the following graphs correctly shows the resting
membrane becoming hyperpolarized when a stimulus is applied?
