processes. (a) An endothermic process 
1∆H 7 02 deposits heat into the system.  
(b) An exothermic process 1∆H 6 02 
withdraws heat from the system.
Give It Some Thought
When a reaction occurs in a flask, you notice that the flask gets colder. What is the 
sign of ∆H?
Because H is a state function, ∆H (which equals qP) depends only on the initial and 
 
final states of the system, not on how the change occurs. At first glance this statement

Determining the Sign of 횫H
Indicate the sign of the enthalpy change, ∆H, in the following processes carried out under  
atmospheric pressure and indicate 
whether each process is endothermic or exothermic: (a) An ice cube melts; (b) 1 g of butane 1C4H102 is combusted in sufficient 
oxygen to give complete combustion to CO2 and H2O.
