of this light, in joules? (b) Write an equation that shows the 
process corresponding to the ﬁrst ionization energy of Hg.

of mercury.
 7.112  Mercury in the environment can exist in oxidation states 0, 
+1, and +2. One major question in environmental chemistry 
research is how to best measure the oxidation state of mercu-
ry in natural systems; this is made more complicated by the 
fact that mercury can be reduced or oxidized on surfaces dif-
ferently than it would be if it were free in solution. XPS, X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy, is a technique related to PES (see 
Exercise 7.111), but instead o
