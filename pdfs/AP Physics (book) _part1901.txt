The 6000 vertical wires (data lines) get their signal voltages
(data stream) updated just before each row is activated in order to establish the
brightness of each subpixel in that next row. All 1080 rows are activated, one-by-one,
within 
to complete that frame. Then a new frame is started.
New TV sets today can often refresh the screen at a higher rate. A refresh rate
of 120 Hz (or 240 Hz) means that frames are interpolated between the normal ones,
by averaging, which produces less blurring in fast action scenes.
Digital TV is transmitted at about 19 MB s as mentioned in Section 17–10.
(This rate is way too slow to do a full refresh every 
—try the calculation and
see—so a lot of compression is done and the areas where most movement occurs get
refreshed.) The TV set or “box”that receives the digital video signal has to decode the
signal in order to send analog voltages to the pixels of the screen, and at just the
right time. TV stations in the U.S.a
