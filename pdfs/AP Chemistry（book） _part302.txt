nsists of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms and is therefore 
represented by the chemical formula CH4. Lack of a subscript on the C indicates one 
atom of C per methane molecule. Several common molecules of both elements and 
compounds are shown in Figure 2.17. Notice how the composition of each substance is 
given by its chemical formula. Notice also that these substances are composed only of 
nonmetallic elements. 
Most of the molecular substances we will encounter contain only nonmetals.
Molecular and empirical Formulas
Chemical formulas that indicate the actual numbers of atoms in a molecule are called 
molecular formulas. (The formulas in Figure 2.17  are molecular formulas.) Chemical 
formulas that give only the relative number of atoms of each type in a molecule are called 
empirical formulas. The subscripts in an empirical formula are always the smallest 
possible whole-number ratios. The molecular formula for hydrogen peroxide is H2O2, 
for example, whereas its empirical
