If X were 
a metal, the compound would be ionic and the charge on X would be 
4+. The bonding (ionic) radius of X4+ would be much smaller than 
that of ﬂuorine. 7.9 (a) The results are 2, 8, 18, 32. (b) The atomic 
numbers of the noble gases are 2, 10, 18, 36, 54, and 86. The differ-
ences between sequential pairs of these atomic numbers is 8, 8, 18, 18, 
and 32. These differences correspond to the results in (a). They rep-
resent the ﬁlling of new subshells when moving across the next row 
of the periodic chart. (c) The Pauli exclusion principle is the source 
of the “2”. 7.11 (a) Of the elements listed, only Fe was known before 
1700. (b) The seven metals known in ancient times, Fe, Cu, Ag, Sn, Au, 
Hg, and Pb, are mostly near the bottom of the activity series, Table 
4.5. 7.13 For elements 1–18, H, Li, and Na have minimum values of 
Zeff; Ne and Ar have maximum values. 7.15 (a) For both Na and K, 
Zeff = 1. (b) For both Na and K, Zeff = 2.2. (c) Slater’s rules give values 
closer to
