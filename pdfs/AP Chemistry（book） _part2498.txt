f a CO pressure of 150 torr is to be 
employed in the furnace and total pressure never exceeds 
760 torr, will reduction occur?
 15.88 Le Châtelier noted that many industrial processes of his 
time could be improved by an understanding of chemical 
equilibria. For example, the reaction of iron oxide with 
carbon monoxide was used to produce elemental iron 
and CO2 according to the reaction
Fe2O31s2 + 3 CO1g2 ∆ 2 Fe1s2 + 3 CO21g2
 
 Even in Le Châtelier’s time, it was noted that a great deal 
of CO was wasted, expelled through the chimneys over the 
furnaces. Le Châtelier wrote, “Because this incomplete reac-
tion was thought to be due to an insufficiently prolonged 
contact between carbon monoxide and the iron ore [oxide], 
the dimensions of the furnaces have been increased. In 
England, they have been made as high as 30 m. But the pro-
portion of carbon monoxide escaping has not diminished, 
thus demonstrating, by an experiment costing several hun-
dred thousand francs, that the reduc
