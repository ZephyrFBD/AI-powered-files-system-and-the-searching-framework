Where the Cult came from
When I realised in the early 1990s there was a Cult network behind
global events I asked the obvious question: When did it start? I took
it back to ancient Rome and Egypt and on to Babylon and Sumer in
Mesopotamia, the ‘Land Between Two Rivers’, in what we now call
Iraq. The two rivers are the Tigris and Euphrates and this region is of
immense historical and other importance to the Cult, as is the land
called Israel only 550 miles away by air. There is much more going
with deep esoteric meaning across this whole region. It’s not only
about ‘wars for oil’.
