he
object undergoes an acceleration a. Let’s do a dimensional check to see if this
equation could be correct or is surely incorrect. Note that numerical factors,
like the 
here, do not affect dimensional checks. We write a dimensional
equation as follows, remembering that the dimensions of speed are 
and
(as we shall see in Chapter 2) the dimensions of acceleration are 
The dimensions are incorrect: on the right side, we have the sum of quantities
whose dimensions are not the same. Thus we conclude that an error was made
in the derivation of the original equation.
A dimensional check can only tell you when a relationship is wrong. It can’t
tell you if it is completely right. For example, a dimensionless numerical factor
(such as or 
) could be missing.
Dimensional analysis can also be used as a quick check on an equation you
are not sure about. For example, consider a simple pendulum of length . Suppose
that you can’t remember whether the equation for the period T (the time to make
one
