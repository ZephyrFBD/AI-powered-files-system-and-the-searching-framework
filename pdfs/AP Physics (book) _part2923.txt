two distances, one for each reference frame. [This surprising result is explored
in the next Section (26–5).]
SOLUTION (a) The given 10.0-min time interval is the proper time 
—starting
and finishing the magazine happen at the same place on the spaceship. Earth
clocks measure
(b) In the Earth frame,
the rocket travels a
distance 
In the spaceship’s frame, the Earth is moving away from the spaceship at 0.75c,
but the time is only 10.0 min, so the distance is measured to be
Space Travel?
Time dilation has aroused interesting speculation about space travel. According
to classical (Newtonian) physics, to reach a star 100 light-years away would not
be possible for ordinary mortals (1 light-year is the distance light can travel 
in
). Even if a spaceship
could travel at close to the speed of light, it would take over 100 years to reach
such a star. But time dilation tells us that the time involved could be less. In
a spaceship traveling at 
the time for such a trip would be only about
Thus t
