27–2 Blackbody Radiation;
Planck’s Quantum Hypothesis
Blackbody Radiation
One of the observations that was unexplained at the end of the nineteenth cen-
tury was the spectrum of light emitted by hot objects. We saw in Section 14–8
that all objects emit radiation whose total intensity is proportional to the fourth
power of the Kelvin (absolute) temperature 
At normal temperatures
we are not aware of this electromagnetic radiation because of its low
intensity. At higher temperatures, there is sufficient infrared radiation that we
can feel heat if we are close to the object. At still higher temperatures (on the
order of 1000 K), objects actually glow, such as a red-hot electric stove burner or
the heating element
