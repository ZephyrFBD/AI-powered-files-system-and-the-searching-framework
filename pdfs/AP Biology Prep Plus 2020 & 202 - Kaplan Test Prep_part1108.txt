Irrigation for agriculture can lead to salinization of soils, especially in arid and
semi-arid climates. In order to study the eﬀects of saline soils on plant
development, students collected soil samples from a variety of locations. They
noted the soil texture and measured electrical conductivity (EC), measured in
decisiemens per meter (dS/m), which reflects the soil’s salinity, or total soluble
salt concentration, as shown in Table 1.

Pea (Pisum sativum) seeds were planted in each type of soil. Following the
emergence of the cotyledon leaves, each plant was placed in a sunny location and
watered with 50 mL of water each morning for 60 days. The plants (n = 10) were
then clipped close to ground level and weighed (fresh weight). R
