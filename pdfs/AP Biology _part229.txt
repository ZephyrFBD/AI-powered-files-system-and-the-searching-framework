er the production of sugar,
the Calvin cycle uses ATP formed during the light reactions. Both
reactions occur only when light is present. See Figure 7.6 for an overview
of photosynthesis.

PHOTOSYNTHETIC PIGMENTS
Photosynthetic pigments absorb light energy and use it to provide energy
to carry out photosynthesis. Plants contain two major groups of pigments:
the chlorophylls and carotenoids. Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are
green and absorb all wavelengths of light in the red, blue, and violet
ranges. The carotenoids are yellow, orange, and red. They absorb light in
the blue, green, and violet ranges. Xanthophyll, another photosynthetic
pigment, is a carotenoid with a slight chemical variation. Pigments found
in red algae, the phycobilins, are reddish and absorb light in the blue and
green range. Chlorophyll b, the carotenoids, and the phycobilins are
known as antenna pigments because they capture light in wav
