 When the cough passes he falls back on the pillow. Ah, Frankie, I knew 
 
 your mother well. Danced with her, Mother o’ Christ, I’m dying inside, 
 
 danced with her I did below in the Wembley Hall and a champion 
 
 dancer she was too. 
 
 He hangs over the bucket again. He gasps for air and reaches his 
 
 arms out to get it. He suffers but he won’t stop talking. 
 
 Champion dancer she was, Frankie. Not skinny mind you but a 
 
  
  
 feather in my arms and there was many a sorry man when she left Limerick. 
 
 Can you dance, Frankie? 
 
 Ah, no, Mr. Clohessy. 
 
 Paddy says, He can, Dada. He had the lessons from Mrs. O’Connor 
 
 and Cyril Benson. 
 
 Well, dance, Frankie. Round the house an’ mind the dresser, 
 
 Frankie. Lift the foot, lad. 
 
 I can’t, Mr. Clohessy. I’m no good.
