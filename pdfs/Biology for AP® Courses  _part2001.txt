18.2 | Formation of New Species
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What defines a species, and how can different species be distinguished from each other?
•
How does genetic variation lead to speciation?
•
What is the role of pre-zygotic and post-zygotic reproductive barriers in speciation?
•
What is the difference between allopatric speciation and sympatric speciation?
•
How does adaptive radiation explain the diversification?

Speciation explains the diversity of organisms that inhabit the Earth. Although all life shares various genetic similarities,
only certain organisms combine genetic information by sexual reproduction and produce viable and fertile offspring that, in
turn, can successfully reproduce. Scientists call such organisms members of a biological species. As we will study in later,
changes in allele frequencies within a pop
