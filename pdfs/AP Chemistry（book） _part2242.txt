ward rate constants from smallest to largest assuming all three reactions have nearly the same value for the frequency factor A.
Sample Exercise 14.10
 Activation Energies and Speeds of Reaction
SOLUTION
The lower the activation energy, the larger the rate constant and the 
faster the reaction. The value of ∆E does not affect the value of the 
rate constant. Hence, the order of the rate constants is 2 6 3 6 1.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of the following changes always leads to an increase in 
the rate constant for a reaction:
 (i) Decreasing the temperature
 (ii) Decreasing the activation energy
(iii) Making the value of ∆E more negative
(a) Only one—(i), or (ii), or (iii)—increases the reaction rate.
(b) (i) and (ii)
(c) (i) and (iii)
(d) (ii) and (iii)
(e) All three—(i), (ii), and (iii)—increase the reaction rate.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Rank the rate constants of the reverse reactions from slowest 
to fastest.
Determining the Activation Energy
We can calculate the activation energy
