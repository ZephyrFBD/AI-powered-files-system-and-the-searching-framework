e of ATP and NADPH to convert CO2 to sugars using the Calvin
Cycle.
B. STEP 1—Light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts in eukaryotes.
1. Pigment molecules collect light energy.
i.
Chlorophyll a—main photosynthetic pigment.
ii. Chlorophyll b and carotenoids—accessory pigments that allow leaves to capture a wider spectrum
of visible light than chlorophyll alone.
iii. The following graph shows the absorption spectra of photosynthetic pigments:
2. Photosystems (PS) I and II are embedded in the internal membranes of chloroplasts (thylakoids) and
consist of hundreds of pigment molecules that funnel light energy to two chlorophyll a molecules at
the reaction center of each photosystem. Essentially, they use an electron transport system to transfer
higher free energy electrons.
3. Electron Transport Chain (ETC)—an electrochemical gradient of hydrogen ions (protons) across the
thylakoid membranes that undergoes redox reactions in a series.
i.
Electrons are tran
