n target (protons). The number of
interactions (
scattered) plotted versus the pion’s kinetic energy is shown in
Fig. 32–14. The large number of interactions around 200 MeV led Fermi to
conclude that the 
and proton combined momentarily to form a short-lived
particle before coming apart again, or at least that they resonated together for a
short time. Indeed, the large peak in Fig. 32–14 resembles a resonance curve (see
Figs. 11–18 and 21–46), and this new “particle”—now called the 
—is referred
to as a resonance. Hundreds of other resonances have been found, and are
regarded as excited states of lighter mass particles such as a nucleon.
