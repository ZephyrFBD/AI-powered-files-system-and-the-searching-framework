ted in bacteria that can protect plants from insect pests
and restore ecosystems. Biotechnologies also have been used to produce insulin, hormones, antibiotics, and medicine that
dissolve blood clots. Comparative genomics yields new insights into relationships among species, and DNA sequences
reveal our personal genetic make-up. However, manipulation of DNA comes with social and ethical responsibilities, raising
questions about its appropriate uses.
Nucleic acids can be isolated from cells for analysis by lysing cell membranes and enzymatically destroying all other
macromolecules. Fragmented or whole chromosomes can be separated on the basis of size (base pair length) by gel
electrophoresis. Short sequences of DNA or RNA can be amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Recombinant DNA technology can combine DNA from different sources using bacterial plasmids or viruses as vectors to
carry foreign genes into host cells, resulting in genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Tran
