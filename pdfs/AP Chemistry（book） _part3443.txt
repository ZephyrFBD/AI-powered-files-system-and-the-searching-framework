Tumor cells are killed or damaged by exposure to the alpha particles. 
Healthy tissue farther away from the tumor is unaffected because 
of the short-range penetrating power of alpha particles. Thus, 
neutron-capture therapy has the promise to be a “silver bullet” that 
speciﬁcally targets unhealthy cells for exposure to radiation.
