he diameter and length of cells can be made.
Cells in the growing tip of the root rapidly undergo mitosis, just as the whitefish blastula described in Figure 10.10.
With increasing distance from the growing tip, the rate at which mitosis occurs slows until tissue is reached in which
the initiation of the cell cycle is delayed.
A. Describe a sequence of measurements that could be used to test the assumption that the cell cycle, once started, has
a total time interval of 24 hours. Hint: Rather than counting cells, it might be useful to measure the length of the root
tip and the average length of a cell.
B. Using the data obtained from your measurements described in part A, how can the rate of cell division be calculated?
An experiment that is perhaps similar to one you have proposed was conducted previously (Beemster and Baxter,
1998), and the results are shown in the table.
