cose is described by this equation (notice that it is the reverse of the previous equation):
6CO2 + 6H2 O + energy â†’C6 H12 O6 + 6O2
During the chemical reactions of photosynthesis, energy is provided in the form of a very high-energy molecule called ATP,
or adenosine triphosphate, which is the primary energy currency of all cells. Just as the dollar is used as currency to buy
goods, cells use molecules of ATP as energy currency to perform immediate work. The sugar (glucose) is stored as starch
or glycogen. Energy-storing polymers like these are broken down into glucose to supply molecules of ATP.
Solar energy is required to synthesize a molecule of glucose during the reactions of photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, light
energy from the sun is initially transformed into chemical energy that is temporally stored in the energy carrier molecules
ATP and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). The stored energy in ATP and NADPH is then used
later in photosynthesis to build one
