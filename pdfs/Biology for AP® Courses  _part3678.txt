brates; however, there are
significant differences in the structure of the heart and the circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due
to adaptation during evolution and associated differences in anatomy. Figure 31.4 illustrates the basic circulatory systems
of some vertebrates: fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals.

Figure 31.4 (a) Fish have the simplest circulatory systems of the vertebrates: blood flows unidirectionally from the two-
chambered heart through the gills and then the rest of the body. (b) Amphibians have two circulatory routes: one for
oxygenation of the blood through the lungs and skin, and the other to take oxygen to the rest of the body. The blood
is pumped from a three-chambered heart with two atria and a single ventricle. (c) Reptiles also have two circulatory
routes; however, blood is only oxygenated through the lungs. The h
