opment of a suitable catalyst 
thus became the focus of Haber’s research efforts.
After trying different substances to see which would be most effective, Carl Bosch 
settled on iron mixed with metal oxides, and variants of this catalyst formulation are 
still used today. 
 (Section 15.2, “The Haber Process”) These catalysts make it possi-
ble to obtain a reasonably rapid approach to equilibrium at around 400 to 500 °C and 
200 to 600 atm. The high pressures are needed to obtain a satisfactory equilibrium 
amount of NH3. If a catalyst could be found that leads to sufficiently rapid reaction 
at temperatures lower than 400 °C, it would be possible to obtain the same extent of 
equilibrium conversion at pressures much lower than 200 to 600 atm. This would 
result in great savings in both the cost of the high-pressure equipment and the energy 
consumed in the production of ammonia. It is estimated that the Haber process con-
sumes approximately 1% of the energy generated in the world each
