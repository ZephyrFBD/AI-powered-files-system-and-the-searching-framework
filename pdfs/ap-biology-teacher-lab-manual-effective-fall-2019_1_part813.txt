ent investigation, graph the results. 
Based on the graph and your observations, compare the effects of biotic and abiotic 
environmental factors on the rate(s) of enzymatic reactions and explain any differences. 
â–  Additional Information 
If a spectrophotometer is available, the following information is useful. 
The use of measuring devices can better quantify your results. Using a 
spectrophotometer, you can select a specific wavelength to fit the color/pigment 
expected in an experiment. The change in the amount or concentration of color/pigment 
may be measured as absorbance (amount of the wavelength trapped by the pigment) or 
transmittance (amount of the wavelength that is not trapped by the pigment). 
For Procedure 1: 
1. Turn on your spectrophotometer approximately 10 to 15 minutes prior to 
starting the investigation so that it will warm up appropriately. 
2. To measure the amount of the compound tetraguaiacol, set the wavelength to  
470 nm.
