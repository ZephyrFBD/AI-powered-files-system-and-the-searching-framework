 something other than chance is influencing your results. Crossing over, deleterious
mutations, or nonrandom mating (perhaps some traits produce poor breeders) are
factors to consider. High values of Ï‡2 may also result if the expected values used do not account for sex linkage or
are otherwise in error.
Investigation 1: Artificial Selection
In this investigation, you explore the effect of artificial selection. Artificial selection is selection by humans. We
have used this kind of selection for thousands of years to breed animals for special purposes and to raise plants to
yield larger or more flavorful fruits and vegetables. The investigation suggests using fast-growing plants to examine
trichomes (plant hairs) on leaves, but it also encourages using other observable, heritable traits on these plants. Your
teacher may substitute other organisms.
In this investigation you gain experience observing biological phenomena and collecting and analyzing data. You
learn, first hand, how selecti
