60. A cube of side rests on a rough floor. It is subjected to a
steady horizontal pull F, exerted a distance h above the floor
as shown in Fig.9–79. As F is increased, the block will either
begin to slide, or begin to tip over.
Determine the coefficient of static
friction 
so that (a) the block
begins to slide rather than tip;
(b) the block begins to tip.
[Hint: Where will the normal
force on the block act if it tips?]

63. A uniform meter stick with a mass of 180 g is supported
horizontally by two vertical strings, one at the 0-cm mark
and the other at the 90-cm mark (Fig. 9–82). What is the
tension in the string (a) at 0 cm? (b) at 90 cm?
