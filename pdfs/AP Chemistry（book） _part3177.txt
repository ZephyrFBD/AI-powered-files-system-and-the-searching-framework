CHAPTER 20 Electrochemistry
The two solid metals connected by the external circuit are called electrodes. By defi-
nition, the electrode at which oxidation occurs is the anode and the electrode at which 
reduction occurs is the cathode.* The electrodes can be made of materials that participate 
in the reactio
