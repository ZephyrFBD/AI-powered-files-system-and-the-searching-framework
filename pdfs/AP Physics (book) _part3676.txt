back toward the origin of the
universe. How far back do they look?
RESPONSE The distance in light-years measures how long in years the light
has been traveling to reach us, so Table 33–1 tells us also how far back in time
we are looking. For example, if we saw Proxima Centauri explode into a super-
nova today, then the event would have really occurred about 4.2 years ago. The
most distant galaxies emitted the light we see now roughly 
ago.
What we see was how they were then,
ago.
EXERCISE A Suppose we could place a huge mirror 1 light-year away from us. What
would we see in this mirror if it is facing us on Earth? When did what we see in the
mirror take place? (This might be called a “time machine.”)
Besides the usual stars, clusters of stars, galaxies, and clusters and super-
clusters of galaxies, the universe contains many other interesting objects. Among
these are stars known as red giants, white dwarfs, neutron stars, exploding stars
called novae and supernovae, and black holes who
