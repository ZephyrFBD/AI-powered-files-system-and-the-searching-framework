ave this solution and
more likely to flow into it. This makes sense because the added solute makes the solution more concentrated, and the
water is now unlikely to diffuse away. The more solute molecules present, the more negative the solute potential is.
Remember It Like This
An area of high water potential is an area of high water concentration (e.g., low
solute).
A red blood cell dropped into a hypotonic solution (such as distilled water) will expand because water will move
into the cell, an area of lower water potential. Eventually, the red blood cell will pop. If a similar experiment is done
with a plant cell, water will still move into the cell, but the cell wall will exert pressure, increasing the water
potential and limiting the gain of water. Water potential also explains how water moves from soil into plant roots
and how plants transport water from roots to leaves to support photosynthesis.
Active Transport
Suppose a substance wants to move in the opposite directionâ€”from a re
