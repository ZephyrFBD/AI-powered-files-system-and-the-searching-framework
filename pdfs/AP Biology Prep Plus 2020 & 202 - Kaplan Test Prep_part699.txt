rtificial selection by humans, which has resulted
in todayâ€™s domestic animals, as well as crops with desired traits. Human
populations who live in extremely high-altitude areas (for example, Tibet,
the Andes, and Ethiopia) have evolved enhanced respiratory mechanisms
that allow them to survive in low-oxygen environments.
AP Biology Lab 1: Artificial Selection
Investigation
In this inquiry investigation, you will explore real-time natural selection
using Wisconsin Fast Plants (Brassica), just as Mendel did with pea plants.
This is a long-term laboratory investigation in which you will select, plant,
grow, and tend to a population of plants to observe how natural selection
acts on phenotypic variations. This is a pretty simple investigation in
terms of content and equipment. However, throughout the course of this
seven-week investigation, you must keep detailed records in which you
quantify variation, record images of that variation, and evaluate and
explain your results. These skills wi
