ncreatic juices in an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that
neutralizes the acidity of chyme and acts as a buffer. Pancreatic juices also contain several digestive enzymes. Digestive
juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, as well as from gland cells of the intestinal wall itself, enter the duodenum.
Bile is produced in the liver and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. Bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids
while the pancreas produces enzymes that catabolize starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats. These digestive juices break
down the food particles in the chyme into glucose, triglycerides, and amino acids. Some chemical digestion of food takes
place in the duodenum. Absorption of fatty acids also takes place in the duodenum.
The second part of the small intestine is called the jejunum, shown in Figure 25.11. Here, hydrolysis of nutrients is
continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining. The bulk
