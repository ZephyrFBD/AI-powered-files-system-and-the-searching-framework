Genetic Variation in Prokaryotes and Viruses
A. Prokaryotes reproduce asexually, but they also have several methods of genetic recombination.
1. Transformation occurs when a prokaryote takes up foreign DNA from its environment.
2. Transduction is when a virus transfers prokaryotic DNA from one cell to another.
3. Conjugation occurs when a plasmid is transferred from one prokaryote to another through a special
tube-like structure called a pilus.
B. Because prokaryotes have a very short generation time, mutation and genetic recombination play
important roles in producing and maintaining genetic diversity.
C. Virus replication involves invading a host cell and eventually living off of the host by taking over the
metabolic machinery (parasitic).
1. Viruses cannot reproduce independently.
2. Viruses attach to the host via cell surface receptors and inject their DNA into the host.
3. During the lytic cycle, which is a type of viral reproduction, the virus eventually kills the
