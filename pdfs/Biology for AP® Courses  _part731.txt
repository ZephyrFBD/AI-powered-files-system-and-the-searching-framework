l environment, made up of certain amino acid R groups (residues). This unique environment
is perfectly suited to convert particular chemical reactants for that enzyme, called substrates, into unstable intermediates
called transition states. Enzymes and substrates are thought to bind with an induced fit, which means that enzymes undergo
slight conformational adjustments upon substrate contact, leading to full, optimal binding. Enzymes bind to substrates and
catalyze reactions in four different ways: bringing substrates together in an optimal orientation, compromising the bond
structures of substrates so that bonds can be more easily broken, providing optimal environmental conditions for a reaction
to occur, or participating directly in their chemical reaction by forming transient covalent bonds with the substrates.
Enzyme action must be regulated so that in a given cell at a given time, the desired reactions are being catalyzed and
the undesired reactions are not. Enzymes are regulated
