ay of wavelength 5.5 * 10–11 m?
Cell phone antenna. The antenna of a cell
phone is often wavelength long. A particular cell phone has an 8.5-cm-long
straight rod for its antenna. Estimate the operating frequency of this phone.
APPROACH The basic equation relating wave speed, wavelength, and frequency
is
the wavelength 
equals four times the antenna’s length.
SOLUTION The antenna is
long, so
Then
NOTE Radio antennas are not always straight conductors. The conductor may
be a round loop to save space. See Fig. 22–18b.
f = cl = A3.0 * 108 msB(0.34 m) = 8.8 * 108 Hz = 880 MHz.
l = 4(8.5 cm) = 34 cm = 0.34 m.

FIGURE 22–9 Coaxial cable.
Electromagnetic waves can travel along transmission lines as well as in empty
space. When a source of emf is connected to a transmission line—be it two parallel
wires or a coaxial cable (Fig. 22–9)—the electric field within th
