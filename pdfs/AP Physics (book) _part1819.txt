P is a distance x from the
midpoint between the two charges. Express your answer in
terms of Q, x, a, and k.

held together by electrostatic forces as shown in Fig. 16–39.
Assume that the net average charge (due to electron sharing)
indicated on H and N atoms has magnitude 0.2e and on 
the indicated C and O atoms is 0.4e. Assume also that atoms
on each molecule are separated by 
Estimate
the net force between (a) a thymine and an adenine; and
(b) a cytosine and a guanine. For each bond (red dots) 
consider only the three atoms in a line (two atoms on one mol-
ecule, one atom on the other). (c) Estimate the total force for
a DNA molecule containing 
pairs of such molecules.
Assume half are A–T pairs and half are C–G pairs.
