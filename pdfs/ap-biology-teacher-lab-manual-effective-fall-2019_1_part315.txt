 water because of their hydrophobic characteristics. 
The cellular environment is aqueous, meaning that the solvent in which the solutes, 
such as salts and organic molecules, dissolve is water. Water may pass slowly through 
the membrane by osmosis or through specialized protein channels called aquaporins. 
Aquaporins allow the water to move more quickly than it would through osmosis. Most 
other substances, such as ions, move through protein channels, while larger molecules, 
including carbohydrates, move through transport proteins. 
The simplest form of movement is diffusion, in which solutes move from an area 
of high concentration to an area of low concentration; diffusion is directly related 
to molecular kinetic energy. Diffusion does not require energy input by cells. The 
movement of a solute from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration 
requires energy input in the form of ATP and protein carriers called pumps.
