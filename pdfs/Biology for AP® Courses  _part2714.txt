cuticle can protect against
predators. Other adaptations against herbivory include thorns, which are modified branches, and spines, which are modified
leaves. They discourage animals by causing physical damage and inducing rashes and allergic reactions. A plantâ€™s exterior
protection can be compromised by mechanical damage, which may provide an entry point for pathogens. If the first line of
defense is breached, the plant must resort to a different set of defense mechanisms, such as toxins and enzymes.
Secondary metabolites are compounds that are not directly derived from photosynthesis and are not necessary for respiration
or plant growth and development. Many metabolites are toxic, and can even be lethal to animals that ingest them. Some
metabolites are alkaloids, which discourage predators with noxious odors (such as the volatile oils of mint and sage) or
repellent tastes (like the bitterness of quinine). Other alkaloids affect herbivores by causing either excessive stimulation
