object is defined as its mass divided by its
volume. Suppose a rock’s mass and volume are measured to
be 6 g and 
To the correct number of significant
figures, determine the rock’s density (mass volume).

able universe can be modeled as a sphere of radius

Only
about 4% of total mass is due to “ordinary” matter (such as
protons, neutrons, and electrons). Estimate how much
ordinary matter (in kg) there is in the observable universe.
