 taken for each slide. Because the standard error of
group A is larger than that of group B and because the two groups have the same sample size, the standard
deviation of group A must also be larger than that of group B. Note that this may or may not be the case if the
sample sizes were different. A larger standard deviation means the data is more variable, so you can conclude
that the data from group A has a larger spread than the data from group B.
(c) As with most datasets, the researcher is assuming the data fits a normal distribution and that her sample size is
large enough to be meaningful.
(d) More data allows for more confident conclusions. The researcher could therefore take more pictures from each
slide to increase the sample size.
Chi-Square (Ï‡2) Tests
A chi-square test is a statistical tool used to measure the difference between observed and expected data. For
example, suppose you roll a die 120 times. You would expect a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio between all the numbers that come
