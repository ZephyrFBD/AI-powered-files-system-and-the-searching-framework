e and below the center, is twice this, or 98°.
(b) The width of the central maximum is 2x, where 
So
NOTE A large width of the screen will be illuminated, but it will not normally
be very bright since the amount of light that passes through such a small slit will
be small and it is spread over a large area. Note also that we cannot use the
small-angle approximation here 
because is large.
EXERCISE C In Example 24–5, red light 
was used. If instead yellow light
had been used, would the central maximum be wider or narrower?
Diffraction spreads. Light shines through
a small rectangular slit that is narrower in the vertical direction than the 
horizontal, Fig. 24–23. (a) Would you expect the diffraction pattern to be more
spread out in the vertical direction or in the horizontal direction? (b) Should
a rectangular loudspeaker horn at a stadium be tall and narrow, or wide and flat?
RESPONSE (a) From Eq. 24–3a we can see that if we make the slit width D
smaller, the pattern spreads out more
