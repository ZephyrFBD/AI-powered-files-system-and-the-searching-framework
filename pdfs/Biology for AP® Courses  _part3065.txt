 along an axon is
influenced by both the diameter of the axon and the axon’s resistance to current leak. Myelin acts as an insulator that
prevents current from leaving the axon; this increases the speed of action potential conduction. In demyelinating diseases
like multiple sclerosis, action potential conduction slows because current leaks from previously insulated axon areas. The
nodes of Ranvier, illustrated in Figure 26.13 are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon. These unmyelinated spaces
are about one micrometer long and contain voltage gated Na+ and K+ channels. Flow of ions through these channels,
particularly the Na+ channels, regenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon. This ‘jumping’ of the
action potential from one node to the next is called saltatory conduction. If nodes of Ranvier were not present along an
axon, the action potential would propagate very slowly since Na+ and K+ channels would have to continuously regenerate
action potentials at e
