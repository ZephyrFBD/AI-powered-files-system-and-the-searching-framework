order for F3 generation daughter #1 to have
the condition, she would have had to inherit two mutant traits (X–X–), one
from each parent. However, her father does not have the condition.
Therefore, the trait must be autosomal recessive.

X INACTIVATION—THE BARR BODY
Early in the development of the embryo of a female mammal, one of the X
chromosomes is inactivated in every somatic (body) cell. This inactivation
occurs randomly. The process results in an embryo that is a genetic
mosaic; some cells have one X inactivated, some cells have the other X
inactivated. Therefore, all the cells of female mammals are not identical.
The inactivated chromosome condenses into a dark spot of chromatin and

can be seen at the outer edge of the nucleus of all somatic cells in the
female. This dark spot is called a Barr body.
STUDY TIP
All female body cells have one Barr body. Normal male cells have none.
