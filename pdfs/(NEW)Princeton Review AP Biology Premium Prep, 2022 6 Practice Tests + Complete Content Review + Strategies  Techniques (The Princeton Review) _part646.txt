ng about genetic variation. It is true that the rainfall could
affect evolution of the population, but the graph doesn’t address evolution. It shows only the decrease in
biomass. Choice (C) is the best answer since it addresses how the environmental effects ripple through the
levels of the ecosystem. Invasive species do not need an unoccupied niche, and that is not shown in the
graph.

A
The biomass seems to correlate fairly well with the rainfall. Therefore, a rainfall higher than any recorded
would give a biomass higher than any recorded. The axis on the right shows the biomass. With a rainfall
of 120, the biomass should be greater than 150.

A
The secondary consumers’ biomass should always be less than that of the primary consumers, so the only
option is (A).

This is an example of mutualism. Both organisms benefit. Choice (A), parasitism, is a type of symbiotic
relationship in which one organism benefits and the other is harmed. Choice (B), commensalism, occurs
when one
