dst promise us, We would
behold that famous conqueror, Great Alexander, and his paramour, In their
true shapes and state majestical, That we may wonder at their excellence.
FAUSTUS. Your majesty shall see them presently.-- Mephistophilis,
away, And, with a solemn noise of trumpets' sound, Present before
this<156> royal Emperor Great Alexander and his beauteous paramour.
MEPHIST. Faustus, I will. [Exit.]
BENVOLIO. Well, Master Doctor, an your devils come not away
quickly, you shall have me asleep presently:  zounds, I could eat myself
for anger, to think I have been such an ass all this while, to stand gaping
after the devil's governor, and can see nothing!
FAUSTUS. I'll make you feel something anon, if my art fail me not.--
My lord, I must forewarn your majesty, That, when my spirits present the
royal shapes Of Alexander and his paramour, Your grace demand<157> no
questions of the king, But in dumb silence let them come and go.
EMPEROR. Be it as Faustus please; we are content.
BENVOLIO
