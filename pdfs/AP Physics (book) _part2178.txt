 two new magnets are produced, Fig. 20–3, each with north (N) and
south (S) poles. If the cutting operation is repeated, more magnets are produced,
each with a north and a south pole. Physicists have searched for isolated single
magnetic poles (monopoles), but no magnetic monopole has ever been observed.
Besides iron, a few other materials, such as cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, and
some of their oxides and alloys, show strong magnetic effects. They are said to be
ferromagnetic (from the Latin word ferrum for iron). Other materials show some
slight magnetic effect, but it is very weak and can be detected only with delicate
instruments. We will look in more detail at ferromagnetism in Section 20–12.
In Chapter 16, we used the concept of an electric field surrounding an electric
charge. In a similar way, we can picture a magnetic field surrounding a magnet. The
force one magnet exerts on another can then be described as the interaction between
one magnet and the magnetic field of the other.
