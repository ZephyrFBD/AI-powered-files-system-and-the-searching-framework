ture, ¬ R represents ¬ H, ¬CH3, or another 
group of atoms; there are 20 different natural amino acids, 
and each has one of 20 different R groups. (a) Draw the general 
structure of a protein formed by condensation polymeriza-
tion of the generic amino acid shown here. (b) When only a 
few amino acids react to make a chain, the product is called a 
“peptide” rather than a protein; only when there are 50 amino 
acids or more in the chain would the molecule be called a pro-
tein. For three amino acids (distinguished by having three dif-
ferent R groups, R1, R2, and R3), draw the peptide that results 
from their condensation reactions. (c) The order in which the 
R groups exist in a peptide or protein has a huge influence on 
its biological activity. To distinguish different peptides and 
proteins, chemists call the first amino acid the one at the “N 
terminus” and the last one the one at the “C terminus.” From 
your drawing in part (b) you should be able to figure out what 
“N terminus”
