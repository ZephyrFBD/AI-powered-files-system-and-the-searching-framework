ing frame shift. A reading frame shift at the beginning of an
exon or of a coding sequence would be most serious because it
would disrupt the lengthy sequence that follows. One at the end of
an exon would likely be less serious for the same reason. (IST-4)
(A) This answer is true because alternative splicing enables more
than one polypeptide to be formed from one region of DNA,
depending on which parts of the region are transcribed and which
parts are suppressed. Most of the human genome consists of introns
(noncoding sequences), not exons (coding regions). Spliceosomes
are structures that remove introns and are unrelated to the question.

it has been translated. This degradation is a mechanism that controls
how much protein is produced. (IST-2)
(C) Transcription is the process by which DNA makes RNA. There
are three types of RNA: mRNA, tRNA, and r
