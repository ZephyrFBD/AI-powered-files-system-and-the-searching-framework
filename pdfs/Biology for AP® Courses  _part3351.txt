sed into the blood as glucose.
Blood glucose levels increase as most tissues are utilizing fatty acids instead of glucose for their energy needs. The GH
mediated increase in blood glucose levels is called a diabetogenic effect because it is similar to the high blood glucose
levels seen in diabetes mellitus.
The indirect mechanism of GH action is mediated by insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) or somatomedins, which are a
family of growth-promoting proteins produced by the liver, which stimulates tissue growth. IGFs stimulate the uptake of
amino acids from the blood, allowing the formation of new proteins, particularly in skeletal muscle cells, cartilage cells,
and other target cells, as shown in Figure 28.13. This is especially important after a meal, when glucose and amino acid
concentration levels are high in the blood. GH levels are regulated by two hormones produced by the hypothalamus. GH
release is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and is inhibited by growth ho
