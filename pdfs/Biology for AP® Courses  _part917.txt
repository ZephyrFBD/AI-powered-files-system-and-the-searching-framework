eria synthesize sugars, not by using sunlightâ€™s energy, but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical
compounds; hence, they are referred to as chemoautotrophs.

Figure 8.2 Photoautotrophs including (a) plants, (b) algae, and (c) cyanobacteria synthesize their organic compounds
via photosynthesis using sunlight as an energy source. Cyanobacteria and planktonic algae can grow over enormous
areas in water, at times completely covering the surface. In a (d) deep sea vent, chemoautotrophs, such as these
(e) thermophilic bacteria, capture energy from inorganic compounds to produce organic compounds. The ecosystem
surrounding the vents has a diverse array of animals, such as tubeworms, crustaceans, and octopi that derive
energy from the bacteria. (credit a: modification of work by Steve Hillebrand, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; credit b:
