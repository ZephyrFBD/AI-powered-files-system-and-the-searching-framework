A is the area of the surface parallel to the applied force (and not perpendicular as
for tension and compression), and 
is perpendicular to 
The constant of pro-
portionality G is called the shear modulus and is generally one-half to one-third
the value of Young’s modulus E (see Table 9–1). Figure 9–23 suggests why
the fatter book shifts more for the same shearing force.

Volume Change—Bulk Modulus
If an object is subjected to inward forces from all sides, its volume will decrease.
A common situation is an object submerged in a fluid. In this case, the fluid exerts
a pressure on the object
