EVO-3.H
Explain how the risk of 
extinction is affected by 
changes in the environment.
EVO-3.I
Explain species diversity in 
an ecosystem as a function 
of speciation and extinction 
rates.
EVO-3.J
Explain how extinction can 
make new environments 
available for adaptive 
radiation.
EVO-3.H.1
Human activity can drive changes in 
ecosystems that cause extinctions.
EVO-3.I.1
The amount of diversity in an ecosystem can 
be determined by the rate of speciation and the 
rate of extinction.
EVO-3.J.1
Extinction provides newly available niches that
can then be exploited by different species.
