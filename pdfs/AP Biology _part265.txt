 on the same chromosome tend to move
as a unit and not segregate.
Figure 8.3 Linked Genes
The following describes a cross that adheres to the law of independent
assortment. Two flowers are crossed that are homozygous for different
traits and have the genes for height and seed color on different
homologous chromosomes.

The TT YY parent can produce gametes carrying only TY genes. The tt
yy parent can produce gametes carrying only ty genes. A Punnett square is
not needed because only one outcome is possible in the F1: Tt Yy. The
phenotype of all members of the F1 generation is tall plants with yellow
seeds. Their genotype is known as dihybrid.
The Dihybrid Cross
A cross between two F1 plants is called a dihybrid cross because it is a
cross between individuals that are hybrid for two different traits, such as
height and seed color. This cross can produce four different types of
gametes: TY, Ty, tY, and ty. The figure below shows how to set up th
