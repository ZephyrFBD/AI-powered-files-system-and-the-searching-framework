5. Assuming the population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium during year 10, what would be a characteristic of
the population during year 10 of the study?
(A) small population size
(B) random mating
(C) extensive migration
(D) heterozygote advantage
6. Which of the following statements best describes the change in the population between year 6 and year 7 and a
possible reason for the change?
(A) The frequency of the recessive phenotype decreased because the black body phenotype was 100% lethal.
(B) The frequency of the recessive phenotype increased because a change in the environment provided a
selective advantage to flies with the black body phenotype.
(C) The frequency of the recessive phenotype decreased because the dominant phenotype is always the most
common phenotype.
(D) The frequency of the recessive phenotype increased because individual flies adapted to a new, darker
environment.
