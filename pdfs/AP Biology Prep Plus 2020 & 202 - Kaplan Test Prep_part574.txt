mination
to rule out impossible or unlikely conclusions. The percentages given
in the question stem add up to 72%, so the remaining base (whether
uracil or thymine) would have to constitute 28% of the nucleotides.
This eliminates (A) and (B). If the molecule were double-stranded, it
would be expected that there would be equal amounts of cytosine and
guanine, as well as equal amounts of adenine and either thymine or
uracil. Because the percentages are unequal, (C) can also be ruled out.
Thus, the most probable conclusion is that this a single-stranded RNA
molecule, (D).

Learning Objective: 13.7
The EcoRI enzyme would only cleave the plasmid at one location,
which would not separate the plasmid into multiple fragments, but
would leave a single linear strand of DNA 2,000 base pairs long. (B) is
thus correct. (A) is incorrect because it is too short. (C) and (D) are
incorrect because the plasmid is cleaved in only one location, not two,
as would be required to have two fragments.
