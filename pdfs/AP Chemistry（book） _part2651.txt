 acts as a base, 
which atom in hydroxylamine accepts a proton? (c) There 
are two atoms in hydroxylamine that have nonbonding 
electron pairs that could act as proton acceptors. Use Lewis 
structures and formal charges 
 (Section 8.5) to rational-
ize why one of these two atoms is a much better proton ac-
ceptor than the other.
 16.68  The hypochlorite ion, ClO-, acts as a weak base. (a) Is ClO- 
a stronger or weaker base than hydroxylamine? (b) When 
ClO- acts as a base, which atom, Cl or O, acts as the proton 
acceptor? (c) Can you use formal charges to rationalize your 
answer to part (b)?
 16.69  Write the chemical equation and the Kb expression for the 
reaction of each of the following bases with water: (a) dime-
thylamine, 1CH322NH; (b) carbonate ion, CO3
2-; (c) formate 
ion, CHO2
-.
 16.70  Write the chemical equation and the Kb expression for the 
reaction of each of the following bases with water: (a) pro-
pylamine, C3H7NH2; (b) monohydrogen phosphate ion, 
HPO4
2-; (c) ben
