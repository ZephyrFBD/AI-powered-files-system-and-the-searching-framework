 most likely
effect on the snake species in that environment.

(B) Snake species that are resistant to the cane toads’ toxin will increase in numbers.

7. The human TAS2R38 gene encodes a cell membrane protein that influences the ability to taste bitter
compounds. Individuals who possess at least one TAS2R38 allele have the “taster” phenotype and can taste
certain types of bitter compounds. It is estimated that about 70% of humans have the taster phenotype. Which of
the following best explains the frequency of the taster phenotype?
(A) Many toxic compounds have a bitter taste, so the TAS2R38 allele provided a survival advantage in
ancestral humans.
(B) Ancestral humans with the TAS2R38 allele were more likely to consume bitter-tasting foods.
(C) Bitter
