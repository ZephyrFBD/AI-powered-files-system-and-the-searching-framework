e not interested in the energy in any one
particular aqueous system, but are very interested in water movement between two systems. In practical terms, therefore,
water potential is the difference in potential energy between a given water sample and pure water (at atmospheric pressure
and ambient temperature). Water potential is denoted by the Greek letter Ψ (psi) and is expressed in units of pressure
(pressure is a form of energy) called megapascals (MPa). The potential of pure water (Ψwpure H2O) is, by convenience of
definition, designated a value of zero (even though pure water contains plenty of potential energy, that energy is ignored).
Water potential values for the water in a plant root, stem, or leaf are therefore expressed relative to Ψwpure H2O.
The water potential in plant solutions is influenced by solute concentration, pressure, gravity, and factors called matrix
effects. Water potential can be broken down into its individual components using the following equation:
