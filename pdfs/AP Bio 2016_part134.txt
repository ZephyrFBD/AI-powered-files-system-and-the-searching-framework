Question 7 
 
Figure 1. Simplified starch biosynthesis pathway in plants 
A rice grain is a fruit that encloses a seed. Most of the dry mass of a rice grain is starch. In rice plants, 
starch is produced by hydrolyzing sucrose and then linking the released glucose molecules together 
into starch (Figure 1). The optimal temperature range for starch synthase activity in a particular strain 
of rice is 27°C–30°C. The optimal temperature range for sucrose synthase in the strain is 30°C–35°C. 
Describe how temperatures above 35°C most likely affect the structure and function of the starch 
synthase in the particular strain. Using the information provided, predict the most likely 
consequences to starch content in mature rice grains if the rice is grown in
