 smaller organisms have a greater surface area to volume ratio and therefore lose more heat to
their environment. Smaller animals need higher metabolic rates to compensate for this loss of heat.
Access to energy is key to maintaining the health of an organism. Organisms are constantly expending energy to
survive and obtaining energy from the food they eat (or the carbon-containing molecules they produce if the
organism is photosynthetic). A net gain in energy can result in energy storage (such as in fat tissues of animals) or
the growth of an organism. A net loss of energy can result in the loss of mass or even the death of the organism.
Changes in energy availability in an ecosystem, such as a reduction in sunlight or in the number of producers,
can result in changes in population size. If energy becomes less available in an ecosystem (for example, if a large
building reduces the amount of sunlight available), the producersâ€™ ability to perform photosynthesis will be reduced,
and some
