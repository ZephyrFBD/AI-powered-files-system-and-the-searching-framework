General Problems
74. (a) What value of magnetic field would make a beam of
electrons, traveling to the west at a speed of 
go undeflected through a region where there is a uniform
electric field of 
pointing south? (b) What 
is the direction of the magnetic field if it is perpendicular
to the electric field? (c) What is the frequency of the circular
orbit of the electrons if the electric field is turned off?
75. Magnetic fields are very useful in particle accelerators for
“beam steering”; that is, the magnetic fields can be used 
to change the direction of the beam of charged particles
without altering their speed (Fig.20–65). Show how this could
work with a beam of protons. What happens to protons
that are not moving with the speed for which the magnetic
field was designed? If the field extends over a region 5.0 cm
wide and has a magnitude
of 0.41 T, by approximately
what angle
