Measurement
Give It Some Thought
What happens to the chemical energy of a lithium-ion battery as it is discharged to 
power a laptop computer? Does it increase, decrease, or remain unchanged?
All other forms of energy—the energy stored in a stretched spring, in a weight held 
above your head, or in a chemical bond—are classified as potential energy. An object has 
potential energy by virtue of its position relative to other objects. Potential energy is, 
in essence, the “stored” energy that arises from the attractions and repulsions an object 
experiences in relation to other objects.
We are familiar with many instances in which potential energy is converted into 
kinetic energy. For example, think of a cyclist poised at the top of a hill (Figure 1.16). 
Because of the attractive force of gravity, the potential energy of the bicycle is greater at 
the top of the hill than at the bottom. As a result, the bicycle easily rolls down the hill 
with increasing speed. As it does so, potential
