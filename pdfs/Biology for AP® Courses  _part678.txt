 an energy-releasing, negative ∆G reaction actually require some energy to proceed? The reason lies in the
steps that take place during a chemical reaction. During chemical reactions, certain chemical bonds are broken and new
ones are formed. For example, when a glucose molecule is broken down, bonds between the carbon atoms of the molecule
are broken. Since these are energy-storing bonds, they release energy when broken. However, to get them into a state that
allows the bonds to break, the molecule must be somewhat contorted. A small energy input is required to achieve this
contorted state. This contorted state is called the transition state, and it is a high-energy, unstable state. For this reason,
reactant molecules don’t last long in their transition state, but very quickly proceed to the next steps of the chemical reaction.
