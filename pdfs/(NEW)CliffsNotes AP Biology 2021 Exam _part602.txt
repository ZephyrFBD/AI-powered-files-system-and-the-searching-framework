dometrium thickens. Estrogen and progesterone stimulate the development of the endometrium, the
inside lining of the uterus. It thickens with nutrient-rich tissue and blood vessels in preparation for the implantation
of a fertilized egg.
7. The hypothalamus and anterior pituitary terminate the reproductive cycle. Negative feedback from high
levels of estrogen and progesterone cause the anterior pituitary (through the hypothalamus) to abate production of
FSH and LH.
8. The endometrium disintegrates. In the absence of FSH and LH, the corpus luteum deteriorates. As a result,
estrogen and progesterone production stops. Without estrogen and progesterone, growth of the endometrium is no
longer supported, and it disintegrates, sloughing off during menstruation (flow phase of the menstrual cycle).
9. The implanted embryo sustains the endometrium. If implantation occurs, the implanted embryo secretes
human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to sustain the corpus luteum. As a result, the corpus luteum
