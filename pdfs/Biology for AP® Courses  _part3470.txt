iphyses, are covered with articular cartilage and are filled with red
bone marrow, which produces blood cells (Figure 29.17). Most of the limb bones are long bonesâ€”for example, the femur,
tibia, ulna, and radius. Exceptions to this include the patella and the bones of the wrist and ankle.

Figure 29.17 The long bone is covered by articular cartilage at either end and contains bone marrow (shown in yellow
in this illustration) in the marrow cavity.
Short bones, or cuboidal bones, are bones that are the same width and length, giving them a cube-like shape. For example,
the bones of the wrist (carpals) and ankle (tarsals) are short bones (Figure 29.16).
Flat bones are thin and relatively broad bones that are found where extensive protection of organs is required or where
broad surfaces of muscle attachment are required. Examples of flat bones are the sternum (breast bone), ribs, scapulae
(shoulder blades), and the roof of the skull (Figure 29.16
