n. So the Moon needs more time (
2 days)
to be fully aligned with the Sun and Earth and be a Full moon, Fig. 5–31e. The
red dot in Figs.5–31a, b, and e represents an observer at the same location on Earth,
which in (a) is when the Full moon is rising and the Sun is just setting.
5–10 Types of Forces in Nature
We have already discussed that Newton’s law of universal gravitation, Eq. 5–4,
describes how a particular type of force—gravity—depends on the masses of the
objects involved and the distance between them. Newton’s second law,
on the other hand, tells how an object will accelerate due to any type of force. But
what are the types of forces that occur in nature besides gravity?
In the twentieth century, physicists came to recognize four fundamental forces
in nature: (1) the gravitational force; (2) the electromagnetic force (we shall see
later that electric and magnetic forces are intimately related); (3) the strong nuclear
force (which holds protons and neutrons together to form ato
