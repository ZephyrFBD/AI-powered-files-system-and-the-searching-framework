agrass has been a common grass
grown by many ranchers for cattle, the development of GMO haygrazer has
produced a faster-growing grass. The same amount of sun, water, and fertilizer
can produce up to over 100 times more dry weight of haygrazer than
bermudagrass. Unfortunately, while the bermudagrass can be used at any stage
for grazing, haygrazer can only be fed to cattle aȇer it reaches a height of 18
inches. Before then, the haygrazer has toxic levels of nitrate that may cause death
in cattle. So while the haygrazer may allow for more cattle to live on a smaller plot
of land, ranchers must work to grow grass and rotate the cattle such that the cows
are only grazing on the low nitrate grass.
