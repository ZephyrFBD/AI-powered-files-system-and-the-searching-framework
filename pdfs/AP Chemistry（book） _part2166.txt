pair domains around the central atom in each of these 
anions?
(b) What is the electron-domain geometry around the 
central B in BARF?
(c) Which, if any, of these anions has an expanded octet

(a) A sample of hydrogen gas is generated in a closed 
container by reacting 2.050 g of zinc metal with 15.0 mL 
of 1.00 M sulfuric acid. Write the balanced equation for 
the reaction, and calculate the number of moles of hy-
drogen formed, assuming that the reaction is complete. 
(b) The volume over the solution in the container is 122 
mL. Calculate the partial pressure of the hydrogen gas in 
this volume at 25 Â°C, ignoring any solubility of the gas in
