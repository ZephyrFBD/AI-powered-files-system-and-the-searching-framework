B. Shivering occurs when you have a fever even though
your body temperature has not fallen. Identify the

can cause this effect and describe how the brain has
integrated the immune system and nervous system to

Thermogenesis from accelerated metabolism in adipose
(fat) tissue is a non-shivering response to a cold stimulus.
Using a neurotropic virus, investigators are able to trace
the paths of nerves in animals. Neurons infected by virus
can then be visualized by exposing the tissue to antibodies
that can be stained or using dyes that fluoresce. Ryu and
