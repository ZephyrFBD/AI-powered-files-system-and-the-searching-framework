There are multiple types of viruses and virus-like
structures. Bacteriophages, or phages, are viruses that infect
bacteria. Viroids and prions are not viruses in the traditional
sense but are still infectious. One of the most famous prions is
responsible for causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or
mad cow disease.

Viruses can replicate in several ways, including the lytic and
lysogenic cycles.
3.
Bacteria use four distinctive mechanisms to increase genetic
variation: transformation, transduction, conjugation, and
transposition.

study of genetic transformations and why?
Escherichia coli, because they have short generation times
