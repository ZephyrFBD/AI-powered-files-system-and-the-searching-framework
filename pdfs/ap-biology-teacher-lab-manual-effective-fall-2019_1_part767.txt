flies were attracted? 
2. Is there anything that was shared by all of the environmental factors to which the 
flies were repelled? 
3. How do you explain the behavior of fruit flies in someone’s kitchen or in nature 
based on the information you collected? Do your data explain all fruit fly

organisms.
