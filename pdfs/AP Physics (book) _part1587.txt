39. (II) How long does it take the Sun to melt a block of ice at
0°C with a flat horizontal area 
and thickness 1.0 cm?
Assume that the Sun’s rays make an angle of 35° with the
vertical and that the emissivity of ice is 0.050.
40. (II) Heat conduction to skin. Suppose 150 W of heat flows by
conduction from the blood capillaries beneath the skin to
the body’s surface area of 
If the temperature differ-
ence is 0.50 C°, estimate the average distance of capillaries
below the skin surface.
41. (II) Two rooms, each a cube 4.0 m per side, share a 14-cm-
thick brick wall. Because of a number of 100-W lightbulbs
in one room, the air is at 30°C, while in the other room it is
at 10°C. How many of the 100-W bulbs are needed to
maintain the temperature difference across the wall?
42. (II) A 100-W lightbulb generates 95 W of heat, which is
dissipated through a glass bulb that has a radius of 3.0 cm
and is 0.50 mm thick. What is the difference in temperature
between the inner and out
