es. A solution contain-
ing an unknown concentration of the acid is titrated with 
NaOH. It requires 24.65 mL of 0.2500 M NaOH solution to 
titrate both acidic protons in 50.00 mL of the tartaric acid 
solution. Write a balanced net ionic equation for the neu-
tralization reaction, and calculate the molarity of the tartaric 
acid solution.
 4.103 (a) A strontium hydroxide solution is prepared by dissolv-
ing 12.50 g of Sr1OH22 in water to make 50.00 mL of solu-
tion. What is the molarity of this solution? (b) Next the 
strontium hydroxide solution prepared in part (a) is used 
to titrate a nitric acid solution of unknown concentration. 
Write a balanced chemical equation to represent the reaction 
between strontium hydroxide and nitric acid solutions. (c) If 
23.9 mL of the strontium hydroxide solution was needed to 
neutralize a 37.5 mL aliquot of the nitric acid solution, what 
is the concentration (molarity) of the acid?
