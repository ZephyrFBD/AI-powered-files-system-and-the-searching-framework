brane protein
of the vesicles that bud from the Golgiâ€™s trans face. When the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane, the protein
becomes an integral portion of that cell membrane. (credit: modification of work by Magnus Manske)
If a peripheral membrane protein were synthesized inside the lumen of the ER, would it end up on the inside or outside
of the plasma membrane?
a.
The vesicle travels from the endoplasmic reticulum to get embedded in plasma membrane.
b.
The vesicle travels from the Golgi to the plasma membrane to release the protein outside.
c.
The vesicle travels from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, and returns to the Golgi
apparatus to get modified.
d.
The vesicle moves from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasmic area, remaining there.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 4.18) is a series of interconnected membranous sacs and tubules that col
