 naturally occurring mixture of gaseous 
hydrocarbon compounds composed of hydrogen and carbon. 
(Section 5.8)
nematic liquid crystalline phase A liquid crystal in which the 
molecules are aligned in the same general direction, along 
their long axes, but in which the ends of the molecules are not 
aligned. (Section 11.7)
Nernst equation An equation that relates the cell emf, 
E, to the standard emf, E°, and the reaction quotient, 
Q: E = E° - 1RT>nF2 ln Q. (Section 20.6)
net ionic equation A chemical equation for a solution reaction 
in which soluble strong electrolytes are written as ions and 
spectator ions are omitted. (Section 4.2)
neutralization reaction A reaction in which an acid and a 
base react in stoichiometrically equivalent amounts; the 
neutralization reaction between an acid and a metal hydroxide 
produces water and a salt. (Section 4.3)
neutron An electrically neutral particle found in the nucleus 
of an atom; it has approximately the same mass as a proton.
