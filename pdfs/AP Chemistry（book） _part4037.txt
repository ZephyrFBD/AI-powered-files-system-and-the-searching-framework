e electrons (b) 16 valence electrons form s 
bonds. (c) 2 valence electrons form p bonds. (d) No valence electrons 
are nonbonding. (e) The left and central C atoms are sp2 hybridized; 
the right C atom is sp3 hybridized. 9.61 (a) ~109.5° about the leftmost 
C, sp3; ~120° about the right-hand C, sp2 (b) The doubly bonded O can 
be viewed as sp2, and the other as sp3; the nitrogen is sp3 with bond 
angles less than 109.5°. (c) nine s bonds, one p bond 9.63 (a) In a 
localized p bond, the electron density is concentrated between the two 
atoms forming the bond. In a delocalized p bond, the electron density 
is spread over all the atoms that contribute p orbitals to the network. 
(b) The existence of more than one resonance form is a good indica-
tion that a molecule will have delocalized p bonding. (c) delocalized
