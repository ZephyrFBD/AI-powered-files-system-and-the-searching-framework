Animal Viruses
Animal viruses, unlike the viruses of plants and bacteria, do not have to penetrate a cell wall to gain access to the host cell.
Non-enveloped or “naked” animal viruses may enter cells in two different ways. As a protein in the viral capsid binds to
its receptor on the host cell, the virus may be taken inside the cell via a vesicle during the normal cell process of receptor-
mediated endocytosis. An alternative method of cell penetration used by non-enveloped viruses is for capsid protein
