Notice also that
and by the law of exponents,
Therefore,
When writing a number in exponential notation, it is usual to make the simple
number be between 1 and 10. Thus it is conventional to write
rather than
although they are the same number.† This notation also allows the number
of significant figures to be clearly expressed. We write
if this value is
accurate to three significant figures, but 
if it
is accurate to only two.
A–4 Algebra
Physical relationships between quantities can be represented as equations 
involving symbols (usually letters of the Greek or Roman alphabet) that repre-
sent the quantities. The manipulation of such equations is the field of algebra,
and it is used a great deal in physics. An equation involves an equals sign, which
tells us that the quantities on either side of the equals sign have the same value.
Examples of equations are
The first equation involves only numbers, so is called an arithmetic equation. The
other
