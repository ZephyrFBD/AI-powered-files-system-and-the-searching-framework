reds-fold greater antibody amounts than were secreted during the primary response, as the graph in Figure 33.17
illustrates. This rapid and dramatic antibody response may stop the infection before it can even become established, and the
individual may not realize they had been exposed.
Figure 33.17 In the primary response to infection, antibodies are secreted first from plasma cells. Upon re-exposure
to the same pathogen, memory cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells that output a greater amount of
antibody for a longer period of time.
Vaccination is based on the knowledge that exposure to noninfectious antigens, derived from known pathogens, generates
a mild primary immune response. The immune response to vaccination may not be perceived by the host as illness but still
confers immune memory. When exposed to the corresponding pathogen to which an individual was vaccinated, the reaction
is similar to a secondary exposure. Because each reinfection generates more memory
