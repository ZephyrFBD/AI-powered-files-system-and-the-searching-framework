creen the fetus for the presence of the FBN1
mutation, and aﬀected fetuses may be aborted. Over time, reducing the
number of those born with the FBN1 mutation would also decrease the
incidence of those with MFS in the general population. (C) is correct. (A),
(B) and (D) are all incorrect because they are all factors—better treatment,
early diagnosis, genotyping, and identifying the disease in individuals
with mild symptoms even in later adulthood—that would also increase
the prevalence of MFS.
17. A
While those with MFS still produce fibrillin-1, one of those two alleles has a
mutation that causes it to produce less than the normal amount, resulting
in less than the normal amount of fibrillin-1 than those without MFS. (A) is
correct. (B) is incorrect because it is stating the opposite. Those with MFS
have inherited a genetic mutation (or spontaneous) that aﬀects the
function of one of the alleles of the gene, which encodes for fibrillin-1,
such that it produces little or no fibrillin-1
