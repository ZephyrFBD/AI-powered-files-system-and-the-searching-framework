population can dramatically impact the spread of a disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) an
emerging disease (Figure 22.22) is one that has appeared in a population for the first time, or that may have existed
previously but is rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range. This definition also includes re-emerging diseases
that were previously under control. Approximately 75 percent of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are
zoonotic diseases, zoonoses, diseases that primarily infect animals and are transmitted to humans; some are of viral origin
and some are of bacterial origin. Brucellosis is an example of a prokaryotic zoonosis that is re-emerging in some regions,
and necrotizing fasciitis (commonly known as flesh-eating bacteria) has been increasing in virulence for the last 80 years
for unknown reasons.
