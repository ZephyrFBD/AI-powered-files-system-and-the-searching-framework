can play key roles in ecosystems or be considered
rare and in need of protection. When discovered, these important species can be used as evidence for
environmental regulations and laws.
Processes and Patterns of Evolution
Natural selection can only take place if there is variation, or differences, among individuals in a population. Importantly,
these differences must have some genetic basis; otherwise, the selection will not lead to change in the next generation.
This is critical because variation among individuals can be caused by non-genetic reasons such as an individual being taller
because of better nutrition rather than different genes.
Genetic diversity in a population comes from two main mechanisms: mutation and sexual reproduction. Mutation, a change
in DNA, is the ultimate source of new alleles, or new genetic variation in any population. The genetic changes caused
by mutation can have one of three outcomes on the phenotype. A mutation can affect the phenotype of the organism
