n the immune system’s memory
cells. The body then has specific immunity toward the virus that has
already invaded.
Vaccination works by stimulating the adaptive immune system to produce
antibodies against invading organisms. This vaccine contains inactivated
virus strains or parts, which activate the production of cells and
antibodies that remove the foreign invaders from the body. Now the body
knows how to fight off that particular invading organism and has
immunization against that virus. If the body is exposed to an active strain
of the same virus, the immune system elicits a rapid and large secondary
response against the antigen. Thus, the body is protected from the viral
infection.
(d) Explain the purpose of a booster dose (the re-exposure to an
antigen aȇer initial immunization). (1 point)

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
If memory against the antigen has declined through time, a booster dose
re-exposes the immune system to the ant
