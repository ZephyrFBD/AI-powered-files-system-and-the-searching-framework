 that convert glucose to two three-carbon
compounds called pyruvic acid.
Figure 3.38
A. Create visual representations to show how when
bonds in the glucose molecules are broken between carbon
number 1 and the oxygen atom and between carbons 3 and
4, two molecules of pyruvic acid are produced.
Several enzymes in the cell are involved in converting
glucose to pyruvic acid. These enzymes are proteins
whose amino acid sequences provide these functions. This
protein structure is information that was inherited from the
cell’s parent, and is stored in deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA). The “deoxyribo” component of that name is a
shorthand for 2-deoxyribose.
B. Create a visual representation of 2-deoxyribose,
5-phosphate by replacing the OH at carbon 2 with a
hydrogen atom and replacing the OH at carbon 5 with a
hydrogen phosphate ion, HPO3-2, whose structure is
shown in problem AP3.2. Use your representation to show
that both phosphorylation (the addition of a phosphate ion)
at carbon 5 and removal
