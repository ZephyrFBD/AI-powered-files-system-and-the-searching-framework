n be 
rotated so that they are equivalent, they are not isomers of each 
other. The problem of identifying isomers is compounded by the 
difficulty we often have in visualizing three-dimensional mole-
cules from their two-dimensional representations. It is sometimes 
easier to determine the number of isomers if we use three-dimen-
sional models.

Optical isomers are usually distinguished from each other by their interaction with 
plane-polarized light. If light is polarized—for example, by being passed through a sheet 
of polarizing film—
