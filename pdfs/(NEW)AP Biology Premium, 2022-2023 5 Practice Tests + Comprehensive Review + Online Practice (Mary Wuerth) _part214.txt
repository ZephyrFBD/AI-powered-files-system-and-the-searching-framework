 per glucose
molecule, both the oxidation of pyruvate and the Krebs cycle occur twice per glucose molecule.
Before moving on to oxidative phosphorylation, review Table 9.5 for a recap of what has been generated for each
glucose molecule that entered cellular respiration.
Table 9.5 Total Products of Glycolysis, Oxidation of Pyruvate, and the Krebs Cycle for Each Glucose
Molecule that Entered Cellular Respiration
When reviewing Table 9.5, notice that all six carbons in the glucose molecule that entered cellular respiration
have been released as carbon dioxide. Four molecules of ATP have been produced by substrate-level
phosphorylation (two in glycolysis and two in the Krebs cycle). A total of 12 high-energy electron carriers (10
NADH and two FADH2) have been produced and will enter the next stage of cellular respiration: oxidative
phosphorylation.
Oxidative Phosphorylation
Oxidative phosphorylation involves the electron transport chain (ETC) and chemiosmosis, both of which occur
on the i
