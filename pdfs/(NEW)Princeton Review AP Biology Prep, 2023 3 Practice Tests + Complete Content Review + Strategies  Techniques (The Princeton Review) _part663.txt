umbers 72 and 83 seem different, when
the std error is considered, the values overlap: 72 + 7.9 = 79.9 and 83 â€“ 4.8 = 78.2. The lean and T2DM participants
each saw an increase in cardiolipin with exercise.
d. If another measure of the citric acid cycle were added in a future experiment, explain what results you would
expect. (2 points)
If another measure were included, I would expect an increase for all groups after exercise.
Question 3
a. In mitochondrial inheritance the offspring have the genotype and phenotype of the mother. Under Mendelian
inheritance it is possible for the offspring to have a different genotype but the same phenotype as the mother.
Describe how this is possible.
It is possible for a mother and offspring to have a different genotype and the same phenotype under classic
Mendelian inheritance because there are more than one genotype that have the same phenotype. For example, a
homozygous dominant and a heterozygous genotype will both have the dominant phenotype.
