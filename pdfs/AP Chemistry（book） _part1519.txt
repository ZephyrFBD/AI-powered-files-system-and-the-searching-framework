 order and magnetic behavior of (a) CO+, (b) NO-, 
(c) OF+, (d) NeF+.
 9.81 Determine the electron configurations for CN+, CN, and 
CN-. (a) Which species has the strongest C ¬ N bond? 
(b) Which species, if any, has unpaired electrons?
 9.82  (a) The nitric oxide molecule, NO, readily loses one electron 
to form the NO+ ion. Which of the following is the best ex-
planation of why this happens: (i) Oxygen is more electro-
negative than nitrogen, (ii) The highest energy electron in 
NO lies in a p
2p
*  molecular orbital, or (iii) The p
2p
*  MO in NO 
is completely filled. (b) Predict the order of the N ¬ O bond 
strengths in NO, NO+, and NO-, and describe the magnetic 
properties of each. (c) With what neutral homonuclear di-
atomic molecules are the NO+ and NO- ions isoelectronic 
(same number of electrons)?
 [9.83] Consider the molecular orbitals of the P2 molecule. Assume 
that the MOs of diatomics from the third row of the periodic 
table are analogous to those from the second row
