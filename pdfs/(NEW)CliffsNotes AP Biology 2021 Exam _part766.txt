The direction of water movement can be determined by
weighing the “cells” before and after immersion.
There are several things to remember for this investigation:
 
1. Diffusion is net movement of substances from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
 
2. Diffusion results from random movement of molecules.
 
3. Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane.
 
Also, keep in mind that the rate of diffusion (and osmosis) is influenced by these factors:
1. The initial rate of diffusion is faster when the concentration gradient is greater. But equilibrium is reached sooner
when the concentration gradient is smaller. This is because the movement of a fewer number of solute molecules is
necessary to establish equilibrium.
2. The rate of diffusion is faster when the temperatures of the solutions are greater. This is because molecules at
higher temperatures have more kinetic energy and are moving faster.
3. The rate of diffusio
