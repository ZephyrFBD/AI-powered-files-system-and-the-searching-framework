FIGURE 20–20 (a) Diagram showing
a charged particle that approaches
the Earth and is “captured” by the
magnetic field of the Earth. Such
particles follow the field lines toward
the poles as shown. (b) Photo of

EXERCISE G What is the sign of the charge in Fig. 20–19? How would you modify the
drawing if the charge had the opposite sign?
Aurora Borealis
Charged ions approach the Earth from the Sun (the “solar wind”) and enter the
atmosphere mainly near the poles, sometimes causing a phenomenon called the
aurora borealis or “northern lights” in northern latitudes. To see why, consider
Example 20–8 and Fig. 20–20 (see also Fig. 20–19). In Fig. 20–20 we
