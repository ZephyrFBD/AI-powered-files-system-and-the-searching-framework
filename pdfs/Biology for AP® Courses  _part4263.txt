ends, shorter, milder winters fail to kill pests increasing the
risk of large, damaging infestations in subsequent seasons.
b.
Warmer temperatures extend growing season of plants, which increases their nutrient requirements
throughout the season. The nutrient requirements are not met once the growing season ends, increasing the
risk of low productivity.
c.
Warmer temperatures reduce the growing season of plants, which increase the risk of low productivity. Once
the growing season ends, shorter, milder winters fail to kill pests increasing the risk of damaging infestations
in subsequent seasons, which also leads to low productivity.
d.
Warmer temperatures reduce the growing season of plants, which increase the risk of low productivity. Once
the growing season ends, milder and shorter winters fail to provide sufficient nutrients to plants increasing
the risk of plant death.
Present Climate Change
A number of global events have occurred that may be attributed to climate change during our
