propriate for the specimen being examined 
and label the side of leaf from which the peel was taken. 
g. Examine the leaf impression under a light microscope to at least 400X (or highest 
magnification). Draw and label what you observe. Can you observe any stomata? 
Search for areas where there are numerous stomata. 
h. Count all the stomata in one microscopic field. Record the number. 
i.  Repeat counts for at least three other distinct microscopic fields and record the 
number of stomata. 
j.  Determine an average number of stomata per microscopic field. 
k. From the average number per microscopic field, calculate the number of stomata 
per 1 mm2. You can estimate the area of the field of view by placing a transparent 
plastic ruler along its diameter, measuring the field’s diameter, and then 
calculating area by using πr2. (Most low-power fields have a diameter between 
1.5–2.0 mm.) 
l.  Trade slides with two other lab teams so you examine three different slides under 
the microscop
