back starting around 1988, and by
the end of the graph the numbers of each were approaching 50% again, suggesting the drought conditions might be
disappearing.
(d) Explain how natural selection led to the rise of the beige moth in the late 1970s?
Natural selection caused the beige moths to become more plentiful because they survive better when the grass
turns brown from the drought. This is probably because the birds cannot find them to eat them as well as the green
moths, which are not camouflaged against the grass because the grass is dry and brown and not green. As the green
moths get eaten, they do not reproduce, and the population becomes filled with a higher percentage of beige moths.
