o bacteria by transformation. Using the same restriction enzyme produces the same sticky ends as that produced
in the foreign DNA. To help in the identification of the copied gene, use a plasmid that has one restriction site for
the restriction enzyme and is engineered to contain the following:
ampR gene . This gene gives a bacterium resistance against the antibiotic ampicillin.
GFP gene. This gene, originally obtained from jellyfish, presents a bright green fluorescence.
lacZ gene. This gene codes for an enzyme that naturally breaks down lactose. Conveniently, the enzyme also breaks
down a related, but artificially made, molecule called X-gal. X-gal is colorless, but it forms a blue product when
broken down by the lacZ enzyme. The one restriction site for the restriction enzyme occurs within the lacZ gene.
3. Mix cut foreign DNA with cut plasmids. As fragments reattach by base-pairing at their sticky ends, foreign
fragments, some of which contain the gene to be copied, will fuse with
