n atoms whose
total mass is 
and whose moment of inertia
about an axis perpendicular to the line joining the two atoms,
midway between them, is 
From these
data, estimate the effective distance between the atoms.
34. (II) A grinding wheel is a uniform cylinder with a radius of
8.50 cm and a mass of 0.380 kg. Calculate (a) its moment of
inertia about its center, and (b) the applied torque needed
to accelerate it from rest to 1750 rpm in 5.00 s. Take into
account a frictional torque that has been measured to slow
down the wheel from 1500 rpm to rest in 55.0 s.
35. (II) The forearm in Fig. 8–46 accelerates a 3.6-kg ball at
by means of the triceps muscle, as shown. Calcu-
late (a) the torque needed, and
(b) the force that must be exerted
by the triceps muscle. Ignore the
mass of the arm.
36. (II) Assume that a 1.00-kg ball
is thrown solely by the action
of the forearm, which
rotates about the elbow
joint under the action 
of the triceps muscle,
Fig. 8–46. The ball is
accelerated
