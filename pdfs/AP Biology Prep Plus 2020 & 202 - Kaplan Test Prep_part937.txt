 number of individuals at this
point is known as the carrying capacity, or the maximum population
size that can be sustained by an ecosystem for an extended period of
time. However, though it is known that this population will eventually
reach its carrying capacity, it is not possible to know when that will
occur, eliminating (A), and there is no data to suggest that it has
already been reached and exceeded, as stated in (D).

Organisms are oȇen grouped into trophic levels of feeding
relationships to allow the transformation of energy in a certain
environment to be studied. Because energy transfer between trophic
levels is usually less than 20 percent eﬀicient, organisms at higher
levels of the pyramid must consume a greater quantity of the
organisms under them in the pyramid to fulfill their energy demands.
As a result, most food pyramids narrow sharply, to reflect
corresponding biomass, from the primary producers (in this case,
algae) to the top-level carnivores (in this case, r
