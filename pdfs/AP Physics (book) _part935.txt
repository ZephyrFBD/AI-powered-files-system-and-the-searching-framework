FIGURE 9–10 Example 9–6.
Our next Example involves a beam that is attached to a wall by a hinge and
is supported by a cable or cord (Fig. 9–10). It is important to remember that a
flexible cable can support a force only along its length. (If there were a compo-
nent of force perpendicular to the cable, it would bend because it is flexible.)
But for a rigid device, such as the hin
