s as if it is open
at both ends. A bugler, by adjusting his lips correctly and
blowing with proper air pressure, can cause a harmonic
(usually other than the fundamental) of the air column
within the tube to sound loudly. Standard military tunes
like Taps and Reveille require only four musical notes:
G4 (392 Hz), C5 (523 Hz), E5 (659 Hz), and G5 (784 Hz).
(a) For a certain length 
a bugle will have a sequence of
four consecutive harmonics whose frequencies very nearly
equal those associated with the notes G4, C5, E5, and G5.
Determine this 
(b) Which harmonic is each of the
(approximate) notes G4, C5, E5, and G5 for the bugle?
