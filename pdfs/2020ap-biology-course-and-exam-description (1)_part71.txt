Structure and function of polymers are derived 
from the way their monomers are assembled—
a.	In nucleic acids, biological information 
is encoded in sequences of nucleotide 
monomers. Each nucleotide has structural 
components: a five-carbon sugar 
(deoxyribose or ribose), a phosphate, and a 
nitrogen base (adenine, thymine, guanine, 
cytosine, or uracil). DNA and RNA differ in 
structure and function.
b.	In proteins, the specific order of amino 
acids in a polypeptide (primary structure) 
determines the overall shape of the protein. 
Amino acids have directionality, with 
an amino (NH2) terminus and a carboxyl 
(COOH) terminus. The R group of an amino 
acid can be c
