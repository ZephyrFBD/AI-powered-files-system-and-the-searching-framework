 PCR, over one million copies of the DNA sequence can be generated.
PCR can also be used to rapidly sequence segments of DNA. DNA sequencing is important in forensics,
bioinformatics, medicine, and evolutionary biology.
CRISPR-Cas9
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system functions in nature as an
adaptive immune system in bacteria. Bacteria can be infected by viruses called bacteriophages. When a
bacteriophage infects a bacterium, it cuts up the viral DNA and inserts those pieces between short palindromic
repeats in the bacteriaâ€™s DNA. This allows the bacteria to store information on which viruses have previously
infected its cell. When another virus infects the bacteria, the bacteria compare the DNA from the new virus to these
stored DNA sequences. If it finds a match, it cuts the DNA of the virus with the Cas9 enzyme.
While CRISPR-Cas9 is not part of the latest AP Biology Course and Exam Description and likely will not be tested on the AP Bi
