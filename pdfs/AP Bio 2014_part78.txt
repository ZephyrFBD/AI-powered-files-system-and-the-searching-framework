 decrease in aspen growth. 
(C) An increase in the growth of aspens will lead 
to a decrease in the wolf population. 
(D) A decrease in the wolf population will lead to 
a decrease in the mean aspen height. 
 
44. Based on the data, which of the following 
behaviors in elk could account for the differences 
between the percent of aspens browsed by 
herbivores and the height of aspen trees in 
riparian and upland environments? 
(A) Elk tend to avoid riparian areas where the 
steep, wooded riverbanks make it difficult 
to escape predators. 
(B) Elk tend to prefer riparian areas where there 
is easy access to water. 
(C) Elk tend to avoid upland areas where trees 
are too tall to be easily eaten. 
(D) Elk tend to prefer upland areas where there 
are richer sources of mineral nutrients, such 
as potassium and iodine. 
 
 
 
45. Which of the following models best predicts the 
effect on the ecosystem if a deadly communicable 
disease is introduced into the wolf population? 
(A) 
 
 
(B)
