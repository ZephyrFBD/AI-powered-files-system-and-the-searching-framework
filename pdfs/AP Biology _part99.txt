ng is how helper T white blood cells send out an alarm to
the entire immune system that the body is being invaded.
Three Stages of Cell Signaling
Regardless of the type of cell communication, local or long-distance, cell
signaling occurs in three stages: reception, transduction, and response.
IMPORTANT
Reception: A chemical signal is detected when the signaling molecule binds to a receptor,
either on the surface of a cell or inside the cell.
RECEPTION—a signal molecule (ligand) from outside the target cell
binds to a receptor either on the cell membrane of or inside the target
cell.
TRANSDUCTION—the signal is converted to a form that can bring about
a specific cellular response.
RESPONSE—a specific cellular response occurs, either by regulation of
transcription or by cytoplasmic action.
WHEN THE RECEPTORS ARE ON THE CELL
SURFACE
Cell membrane receptors span the entire thickness of the membrane and
are therefore in contact with both the extracellular environment and the
cytoplasm. Since
