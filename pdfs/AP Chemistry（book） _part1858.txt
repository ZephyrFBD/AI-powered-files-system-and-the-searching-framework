of a unit cell is shared 
among eight unit cells, and only 1>8 of the atom is in one particular unit cell. Because a 
cube has eight corners, each primitive cubic unit cell contains 11>82 * 8 = 1 atom, as 
shown in Figure 12.12(a). Similarly, each body-centered cubic unit cell [Figure 12.12(b)] 
contains two atoms, 11>82 * 8 = 1 from the corners and 1 at the center of the unit 
cell. Atoms that lie on the face of a unit cell, as they do in a face-centered cubic metal, 
are shared by two unit cells so that only one-half of the atom belongs to each unit 
cell. Therefore, a face-centered cubic unit cell [Figure 12.12(c)] contains four atoms, 
11>82 * 8 = 1 atom from the corners and 11>22 * 6 = 3 atoms from the faces.
Table 12.1 summarizes how the fractional part of each atom that resides within a 
unit cell depends on the atomâ€™s location within the cell.

The shortage of valence electrons and the fact that they are collectively shared make it 
favorable for the atoms in a met
