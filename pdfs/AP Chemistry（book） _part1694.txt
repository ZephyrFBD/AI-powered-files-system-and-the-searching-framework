Lewis structure for ClO2

angle in the ClO2
- ion.  (e) One method of preparing ClO2 
is by the reaction of chlorine and sodium chlorite:
 
 
Cl21g2 + 2 NaClO21s2 ¡ 2 ClO21g2 + 2 NaCl1s2
 
    
If you allow 15.0 g of NaClO2 to react with 2.00 L of chlo-
rine gas at a pressure of 1.50 atm at 21 °C, how many grams 
of ClO2 can be prepared?
   
10.125   
Natural gas is very abundant in many Middle Eastern oil 
fields. However, the costs of shipping the gas to markets in 
other parts of the world are high because it is necessary to 
liquefy the gas, which is mainly methane and has a boiling 
point at atmospheric pressure of -164 °C. One possible 
strategy is to oxidize the methane to methanol, CH3OH, 
which has a boiling point of 65 °C and can therefore be 
shipped more readily. Suppose that 10.7 * 109 ft3 of meth-
ane at atmospheric pressure and 25 °C is oxidized to meth-
anol. (a) What volume of methanol is formed if the density
