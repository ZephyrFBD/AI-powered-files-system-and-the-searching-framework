at stick together
or two railroad cars that couple together when they collide are examples of com-
pletely inelastic collisions. The kinetic energy in some cases is all transformed to
other forms of energy in an inelastic collision, but in other cases only part of it is.
In Example 7–3, for instance, we saw that when a traveling railroad car collided
with a stationary one, the coupled cars traveled off with some kinetic energy. In a
completely inelastic collision, the maximum amount of kinetic energy is transformed
to other forms consistent with conservation of momentum. Even though kinetic
energy is not conserved in inelastic collisions, the total energy is always conserved,
and the total vector momentum is also conserved.

Ballistic pendulum. The ballistic pendulum is a device used
to measure the speed of a projectile, such as a bullet. The projectile, of mass m,
is fired into a large block (of wood or other material) of mass M, which is
