answers to these questions, design a set of experiments to distinguish 
each salt and thus determine which label goes on which bottle.
 
 (a) Is Ritalin an acid or a base? An electrolyte or a non-
electrolyte? (b) A tablet contains a 10.0-mg dose of Rit-
alin. Assuming all the drug ends up in the bloodstream, 
and the average man has a total blood volume of 5.0 L, 
calculate the initial molarity of Ritalin in a manâ€™s blood-
stream. (c) Ritalin has a half-life of 3 hours in the blood, 
which means that after 3 hours the concentration in the 
blood has decreased by half of its initial value. For the 
man in part (b), what is the concentration of Ritalin in 
his blood after 6 hours?
 4.112 The mass percentage of chloride ion in a 25.00-mL sample 
of seawater was determined by titrating the sample with 
silver nitrate, precipitating silver chloride. It took 42.58 mL 
of 0.2997 M silver nitrate solution to reach the equivalence 
point in the titration. What is the mass percentage o
