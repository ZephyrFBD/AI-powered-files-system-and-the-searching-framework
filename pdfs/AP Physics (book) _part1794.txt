within that surface. This is Gauss’s law.
Coulomb’s law and Gauss’s law can be used to determine the electric field
due to a given (static) charge distribution. Gauss’s law is useful when the charge
distribution is simple and symmetrical. However, we must choose the closed
“gaussian” surface very carefully so we can determine 
We normally choose a
surface that has just the symmetry needed so that E will be constant on all or on
parts of its surface.

The results of Example 16–12 also apply to a uniform solid spherical conductor
that is charged, since all the charge would lie in a thin layer at the surface
(Section 16–9). In particula
