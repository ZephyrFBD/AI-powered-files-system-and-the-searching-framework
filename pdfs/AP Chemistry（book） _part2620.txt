s definition. Instead, substances that function as electron-pair 
acceptors are referred to explicitly as “Lewis acids.”
 
SECTION 16.11  Lewis Acids and Bases 
705
Lewis acids include molecules that, like BF3, have an incomplete octet of electrons. 
In addition, many simple cations can function as Lewis acids. For example, Fe3+ interacts 
strongly with cyanide ions to form the ferricyanide ion:
 
Fe3+ + 6 3:C ‚N:4- ¡  3Fe1C ‚N:2643- 
The Fe3 + ion has vacant orbitals that accept the electron pairs donated by the cya-
nide ions. (We will learn more in Chapter 23 about just which orbitals are used by the 
Fe3+ ion.) The metal ion is highly charged, too, which contributes to the interaction with 
CN- ions.
Some compounds containing multiple bonds can behave as Lewis acids. For exam-
ple, the reaction of carbon dioxide with water to form carbonic acid 1H2CO32 can be pic-
tured as an attack by a water molecule on CO2, in which the water acts as an electron-pair 
donor and the CO2 as an ele
