 CH4. Each of its four hydrogen atoms forms a single covalent bond with the carbon atom by sharing a
pair of electrons. This results in a filled outermost shell.
Hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbons are organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen, such as methane (CH4) described above.
We often use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuelsâ€”like the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a lighter. The many
covalent bonds between the atoms in hydrocarbons store a great amount of energy, which is released when these molecules
are burned (oxidized). Methane, an excellent fuel, is the simplest hydrocarbon molecule, with a central carbon atom bonded
to four different hydrogen atoms, as illustrated in Figure 2.23. The geometry of the methane molecule, where the atoms
reside in three dimensions, is determined by the shape of its electron orbitals. The carbons and the four hydrogen atoms
form a shape known as a tetrahedron, with four triangular faces; for this reason, methane is describe
