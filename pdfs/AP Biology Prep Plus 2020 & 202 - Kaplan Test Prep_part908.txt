two cell types are radically diﬀerent in
both form and function. How is it that two cell types within an organism
can arise from the same progenitor cell, yet perform vastly diﬀerent
specialized functions?
Because the cells contain the same DNA, they also contain the same
mRNA transcripts. However, these transcripts are expressed by
ribosomes in diﬀerent ways, leading to diﬀerences between cells.
(A)
The cells contain all the same DNA, but diﬀerent transcription
factors and other regulatory proteins promote the synthesis of
diﬀerent sets of mRNA in each cell type.
(B)
During development, genetic information is lost as cells develop
into their mature forms, thereby silencing genes that will not be
useful to the cell’s intended function.
(C)
The proteins created within the cell are ultimately the same, but
they perform diﬀerent functions based on the signals that the cell
receives from neighboring cells.
(D)
