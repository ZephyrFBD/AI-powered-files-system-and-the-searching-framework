l groups. Notice that, except for C “C and C ‚C, they 
all contain either O, N, or a halogen atom, X.
We can think of organic molecules as being composed of functional groups bonded 
to one or more alkyl groups. The alkyl groups, which are made of C ¬C and C ¬H single 
bonds, are the less reactive portions of the molecules. In describing general features of 
organic compounds, chemists often use the designation R to represent any alkyl group: 
methyl, ethyl, propyl, and so on. Alkanes, for example, which contain no functional 
group, are represented as R¬H. Alcohols, which contain the functional group ¬OH, 
are represented as R¬OH. If two or more different alkyl groups are present in a mole-
cule, we designate them R, R′, R″, and so forth.
Alcohols
Alcohols are compounds in which one or more hydrogens of a parent hydrocarbon 
have been replaced by the functional group ¬OH, called either the hydroxyl group or the 
alcohol group. Note in Figure 24.11 that the name for an alcohol ends in
