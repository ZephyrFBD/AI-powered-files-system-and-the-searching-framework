be metabolized to produce this quantity of 
CO2? (The chemical reaction is the same as that for com-
bustion of C6H12O6. See Section 3.2 and Problem 10.57.)

A 1.42-g sample of helium and an unknown mass of O2 are 
mixed in a flask at room temperature. The partial pressure 
of the helium is 42.5 torr, and that of the oxygen is 
 
158 torr. What is the mass of the oxygen?

An ideal gas at a pressure of 1.50 atm is contained in a 
bulb of unknown volume. A stopcock is used to con-
nect this bulb with a previously evacuated bulb that has 
a volume of 0.800 L as shown here. When the stopcock 
is opened, the gas expands into the empty bulb. If the 
temperature is held constant during this process and the 
final pressure is 695 torr, what is the volume of the bulb 
that was originally filled with gas?
 
10.110  The density of a gas of unknown molar mass was 
measured as a function of pressure at 0 Â°C, as in the table 
that follows. (a) Determine a precise molar mass for t
