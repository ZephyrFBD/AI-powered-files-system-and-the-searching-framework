Describe the relationship between the dimensions of the rectangular solids 
and their surface area-to-volume ratios (SA:V).
•	As the rectangular solid becomes longer, wider, AND thinner, the SA:V 
increases.

Using the data from the model, evaluate the hypothesis that cells shaped 
like rectangular solids 1 and 2 are better suited for slow metabolism and the 
long-term storage of energy-containing molecules than are cells shaped like 
rectangular solids 4 and 5.
•	The data in the table support the hypothesis, since cells with lower surface 
area-to-volume ratios, such as rectangular solids 1 and 2, require smaller 
amounts of plasma membrane and other cellular material to contain a given 
volume of materials than do cells with higher surface area-to-volume ratios, 
such as rectangular solids 4 and 5.
