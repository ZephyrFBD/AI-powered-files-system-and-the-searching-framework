Figure 1. Schematic drawing of the transmembrane sodium channel targeted by pyrethroids and 
other insecticides. The arrow points to the position of amino acid 1014.
To investigate pyrethroid resistance, mosquitoes were collected four times over a two-year period from the following  
two regions.
l Region A: a southern vegetable-growing region where large amounts of insecticide are applied for crop protection
l Region B: a northern rice-growing region where very little insecticide is applied for rice protection
Scientists exposed the collected mosquitoes to filter papers soaked in two different pyrethroid insecticides, deltamethrin 
and permethrin, and the percent mortality of the mosquitoes was determined after 24 hours (Figure 2). The scientists 
simultaneously determined whether leucine or phenylalanine was encoded at position 1014 by each of the two copies of the 
sodium channel g
