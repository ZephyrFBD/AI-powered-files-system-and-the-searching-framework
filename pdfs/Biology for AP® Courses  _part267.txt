creating a high osmotic pressure that could cause excessive water uptake by the cell. Insects have a hard outer skeleton
made of chitin, a unique nitrogen-containing polysaccharide.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in Big
Idea 4 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP® Exam questions. A Learning Objective merges required content with one or more of the seven Science Practices.
