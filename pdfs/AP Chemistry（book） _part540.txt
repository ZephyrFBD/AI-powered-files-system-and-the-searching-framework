 Greek letter 
delta 1d2 is used to denote partial charge: A partial negative charge 
is denoted d- (“delta minus”), and a partial positive charge is 
denoted by d+ (“delta plus”). Cations are attracted by the negative 
end of H2O, and anions are attracted by the positive end.
As an ionic compound dissolves, the ions become surrounded by H2O molecules, as 
shown in Figure 4.3(a). The ions are said to be solvated. In chemical equations, we denote 
solvated ions by writing them as Na+1aq2 and Cl-1aq), where aq is an abbreviation for 
“aqueous.” 
(Section 3.1) Solvation helps stabilize the ions in solution and prevents 
cations and anions from recombining. Furthermore, because the ions and their shells 
of surrounding water molecules are free to move about, the ions become dispersed uni-
formly throughout the solution.
We can usually predict the nature of the ions in a solution of an ionic compound 
from the chemical name of the substance. Sodium sulfate 1Na2SO4), for example, disso-
