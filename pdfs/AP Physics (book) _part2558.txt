may be viewed directly or on a monitor screen
or film. The fibers must be optically insulated from one another, usually by a thin
coating of material with index of refraction less than that of the fiber. The more fibers
there are, and the smaller they are, the more detailed the picture. Such instruments,
including bronchoscopes, colonoscopes (for viewing the colon), and endoscopes
(stomach or other organs), are extremely useful for examining hard-to-reach 
places.
