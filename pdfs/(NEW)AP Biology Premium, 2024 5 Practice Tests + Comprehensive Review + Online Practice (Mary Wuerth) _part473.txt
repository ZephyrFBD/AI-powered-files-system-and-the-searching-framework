 what percentage
of the population possesses at least one copy of the allele for black fur?
In this problem, you are asked to find the frequency of an allele (p). First, start with the recessive
phenotype, brown fur: q2 = 0.10, so q = 0.32. Since p + q = 1, p = 1 – q = 1 – 0.32 = 0.68. So the frequency
of the allele for black fur (p) is 0.68. The second part of the question asks for the percentage of the population
that possesses at least one copy of the allele for black fur. Since black fur is a dominant trait, alleles for black
fur will be found in both homozygous dominant individuals (p2) and heterozygous individuals (2pq). The
frequency of homozygous dominant individuals is p2 = (0.68)2 = 0.46. The frequency of heterozygous
individuals is 2pq = 2(0.68)(0.32) = 0.44. Adding the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals and
heterozygous individuals gives you 0.46 + 0.44 = 0.90, or 90% of the population has at least one copy of the
dominant allele.
