, liquid, and gas-
eous phases coexist. It is marked point 1 in the phase diagram 
and located at approximately -180 °C and 0.1 atm.
(c) The intersection of 0 °C and 1 atm is marked point 2 in the 
phase diagram. It is well within the gaseous region of the 
phase diagram.
(d) If we start in the solid region at P = 1 atm and move hor-
izontally (this means we hold the pressure constant), we 
cross ﬁrst into the liquid region, at T ≈-180 °C, and then 
into the gaseous region, at T ≈-160 °C. Therefore, solid 
methane melts when the pressure is 1 atm. (For methane  
to sublime, the pressure must be below the triple point 
pressure.)
(e) Moving vertically up from point 2, which is 1 atm and 0 °C, 
the ﬁrst phase change we come to is from gas to supercritical 
ﬂuid. This phase change happens when we exceed the critical 
pressure 1∼50 atm2.

Based on the phase diagram for methane (Figure 11.30), what 
happens to methane as it is heated from -250 to 0 °C at a
