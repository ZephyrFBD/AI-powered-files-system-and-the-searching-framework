(a) Describe how CO2 is a measure of respiration. Explain why temperature might affect the rate of
respiration.
(b) On a set of axes, construct an appropriately labeled graph to demonstrate the CO2 levels with changing
temperature. Please include all temperatures, timepoints, and error bars.
(c) Identify which temperature was associated with the highest respiration rate in the crickets.
(d) Predict what would happen to the CO2 levels in the chamber with an additional 5°C increase above the
highest temperature. Justify your prediction with evidence from the data.
3. A researcher was trying to determine why a strain of influenza spreads more easily than other strains. She
suspected that the answer
