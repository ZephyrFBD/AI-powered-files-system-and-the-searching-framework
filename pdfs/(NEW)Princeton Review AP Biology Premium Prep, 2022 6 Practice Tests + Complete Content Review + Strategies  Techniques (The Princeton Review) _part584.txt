in the nucleus. Transcription, (II), the synthesis of RNA from DNA, occurs in the nucleus.

Crossing-over permits scientists to determine chromosome mapping. Chromosome mapping is a detailed
map of all the genes on a chromosome. The frequency of crossing-over between any two alleles is
proportional to the distance between them. The farther apart the two linked alleles are on a chromosome,
the more often the chromosome will break between them. Crossing-over does not tell us about the chance
of variation in zygotes, the rate of mutations, or whether the traits are dominant, recessive, or masked.

In this scenario, the inside of the cell is hypertonic to the outside environmentâ€”this will cause water to
move into the cell and can cause the cell to lyse.

The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that these birds have different ecological niches. An
ecological niche is the position or function of an organism or population in its envir
