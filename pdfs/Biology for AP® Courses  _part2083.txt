The drug-resistant viruses were more fit than
their non-resistant counterparts to begin with,
and over time they dominated the population.
This illustrates evolution as an ongoing process
because natural selection favored one phenotype
over another.
57. A friend says: “Natural selection is about the survival
of the very fittest in a population. The fittest are those that

are strongest, largest, fastest.”
Would you agree with that statement? Explain. What
evidence from scientific disciplines can you offer to
support your agreement or your disagreement?
a.
The statement is true. If an organism is not
strong and fast, it will not survive long enough
to reproduce and pass on its genes, and if it is
not large and fitter than the other individuals
around it then it will not be able to compete for a
mate. Many seal species, for example, have only
a single male who gets to mate. He must be the
very fittest seal to w
