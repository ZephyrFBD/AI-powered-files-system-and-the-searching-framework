 who are exposed to them.
These chemicals work by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase that
is necessary for normal nerve transmission at all neuromuscular junctions
in the body. When insects are exposed to organophosphates, they twitch
for a brief period and then die.
Which of the following explains why animals exposed to this
chemical respond as they do?
The pesticide blocks the release of the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine from presynaptic vesicles, which prevents the
skeletal muscle from contracting.
Acetylcholine is released into the synapse but gets broken
down by the pesticide before it can stimulate a skeletal muscle
to contract.
Muscle contraction is permanently inhibited because the
pesticide prevents acetylcholine from binding to the
postsynaptic receptors on the skeletal muscle.
The pesticide inhibits the enzyme that breaks down
acetylcholine; therefore, the skeletal muscle keeps contracting
until the animal becomes paralyzed and dies.
Because organophosphates affect
