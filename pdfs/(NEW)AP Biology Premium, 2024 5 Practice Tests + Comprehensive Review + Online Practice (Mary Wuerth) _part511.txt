(c) Analyze the data in the graph, and determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in the
number of females approaching males with bird songs in the 120–299 second range and the number of
females approaching males with bird songs in the 300–480 second range.
(d) Predict the number of females that would approach a male with a bird song that is longer than eight
minutes (480 seconds). Justify your prediction.

2. (D) DNA evidence strongly supports a degree of ancestry of organisms. The location of fossils in rock layers
can change due to geological events, so ch
