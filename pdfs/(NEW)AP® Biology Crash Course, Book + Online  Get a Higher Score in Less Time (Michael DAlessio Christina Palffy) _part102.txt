recognized by the ribosome.
i.
A tRNA—which carries the amino acid methionine and has the anticodon UAC—attaches to the
ribosome at one of the sites set aside for tRNA on the ribosome, and its anticodon hydrogen bonds
to the start codon, AUG.
2. Elongation—once the binding occurs, the entire ribosome translocates down another 3 bases and reads
another codon sequence, where another tRNA brings in the appropriate amino acid.
i.
A peptide bond between the amino acids is formed via an enzymatic reaction promoted by the
rRNA portion of the ribosome.
3. Termination—occurs when one of the stop codons (UAA, UGA, UAG) is read and the protein is
released from the ribosome.
E. Protein activities can, in turn, affect the phenotype of an organism. Comparison of normal proteins with
proteins that an abnormal allele is coding for allows scientists to begin to determine possible courses of
treatments, if any. For example, in the case of albinism, the colorless compound DOPA is not converted
to m
