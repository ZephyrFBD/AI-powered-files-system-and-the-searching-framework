sulators that do not allow heat to be trans-
ferred. What is the value of q for the state change? What is 
the sign of w for the state change? What can be said about ∆E 
for the state change? (b) Now assume that the cylinder and 
piston are made up of a thermal conductor such as a metal. 
During the state change, the cylinder gets warmer to the 
touch. What is the sign of q for the state change in this case?

is burned, the temperature rises 1.525 °C. Using the value 
26.38 kJ>g for the heat of combustion of benzoic acid, cal-
culate the heat of combustion per mole of caffeine at constant 
volume. (b) Assuming that there is an uncertainty of 0.002 °C 
in each temperature reading and that the masses of samples 
are measured to 0.001 g, what is the estimated uncertainty in 
the value calculated for the heat of combustion per mole of 
caffeine?
