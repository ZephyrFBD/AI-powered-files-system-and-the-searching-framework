ned and (2) the N¬H and C “O functional groups on adjacent turns are in 
proper position for hydrogen bonding. An arrangement of this kind is possible for 
some amino acids along the chain but not for others. Large protein molecules may 
contain segments of the chain that have the a@helical arrangement interspersed with 
sections in which the chain is in a random coil.
The other common secondary structure of proteins is the B (beta)-sheet. Beta sheets 
are made of two or more strands of peptides that hydrogen-bond from an amide H in one 
strand to a carbonyl O in the other strand. Like the alpha helix, the hydrogen bonding in 
beta sheets is between the peptide backbones, not the side chains.
Give It Some Thought
If you heat a protein to break the intramolecular hydrogen bonds, will you maintain 
the a@helical or b@sheet structure?
