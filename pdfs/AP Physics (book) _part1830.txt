We are used to voltage in our
lives—a 12-volt car battery, 110 V
or 220 V at home, 1.5-volt flashlight
batteries, and so on. Here we see
displayed the voltage produced
across a human heart, known as an
electrocardiogram. Voltage is the
same as electric potential difference
between two points. Electric
potential is defined as the potential
energy per unit charge.
We discuss voltage and its 
relation to electric field, as well as 
electric energy storage, capacitors,
and applicati
