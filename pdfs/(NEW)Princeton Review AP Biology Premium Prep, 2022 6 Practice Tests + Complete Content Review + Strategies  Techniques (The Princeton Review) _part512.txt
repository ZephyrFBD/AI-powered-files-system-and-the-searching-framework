Cl2, (2) heat shock the cells, and (3)
incubate them in order to allow the plasmid to cross the plasma membrane.
LAB 9: BIOTECHNOLOGY: RESTRICTION ENZYME ANALYSIS OF
DNA
This laboratory introduces you to the technique of gel electrophoresis. This technique is used in genetic engineering
to separate and identify DNA fragments. You need to know the steps of this lab technique for the AP Exam:
1. DNA is cut with various restriction enzymes.
2. The DNA fragments are loaded into wells on an agarose gel.
3. As electricity runs through the gel, the fragments move according to their molecular weights. DNA is a
negatively charged molecule; therefore, it will migrate toward the positive electrode. The longer the DNA
fragment, the slower it moves through the gel.
4. The distance that each fragment has traveled is recorded.
Restriction mapping allows scientists to distinguish between the DNA of different individuals. Since a restriction
enzyme will cut only a specific DNA sequence, it will cause e
