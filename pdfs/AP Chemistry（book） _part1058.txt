technology developed during the twentieth century.
The majority of elements readily form compounds and, consequently, are not found 
in nature in their elemental form. For centuries, therefore, scientists were unaware of 
their existence. During the early nineteenth century, advances in chemistry made it eas-
ier to isolate elements from their compounds. As a result, the number of known elements 
more than doubled from 31 in 1800 to 63 by 1865.
As the number of known elements increased, scientists began classifying them. 
In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907) in Russia and Lothar Meyer (1830–1895) in 
Germany published nearly identical classification schemes. Both noted that similar 
chemical and physical properties recur periodically when the elements are arranged 
in order of increasing atomic weight. Scientists at that time had no knowledge of 
atomic numbers. Atomic weights, however, generally increase with increasing atomic 
number, so both Mendeleev a
