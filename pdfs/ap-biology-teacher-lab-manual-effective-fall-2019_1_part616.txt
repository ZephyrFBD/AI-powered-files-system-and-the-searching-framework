Calculating the Sizes of Restriction Fragment Length  
Polymorphisms  
Mathematical formulas have been developed for describing the relationship between 
the molecular weight of a DNA fragment and its mobility (i.e., how far it migrates in the 
gel). In general, DNA fragments, like the ones in your evidence samples, migrate at rates 
inversely proportional to the log10 of their molecular weights. For simplicity’s sake, base 
pair length (bp) is substituted for molecular weight when determining the size of 
DNA fragments. Thus, the size in base pair length of a DNA fragment can be calculated 
using the distance the fragment travels through the gel. To calculate the base pair length, 
a DNA standard, composed of DNA fragments of known base pair length, is run on 
the same gel as the unknown fragments an
