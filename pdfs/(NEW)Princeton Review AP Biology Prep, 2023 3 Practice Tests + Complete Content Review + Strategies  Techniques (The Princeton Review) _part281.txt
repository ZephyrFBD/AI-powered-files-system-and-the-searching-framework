ices that all of the cells appear as shown below. Which of the following best
explains how the chemical is likely acting on the cells?
(A) The chemical has arrested the cells in prophase and has prevented attachment of the spindle fibers to the
kinetochore.
(B) The chemical has arrested the cells in metaphase and has prevented dissociation of the spindle fibers from
the centromere.
(C) The chemical has arrested the cells in metaphase and is preventing the shortening of the spindle fibers.
(D) The chemical has arrested the cells in anaphase and is preventing the formation of a cleavage furrow.
Questions 2 and 3 refer to the following graph and paragraph.
An experiment is performed to evaluate the amount of DNA present during a complete cell cycle. All of the cells
were synced prior to the start of the experiment. During the experiment, a fluorescent chemical was applied to cells,
which would fluoresce only when bound to DNA. The results of the experiment are shown above. Differences in
