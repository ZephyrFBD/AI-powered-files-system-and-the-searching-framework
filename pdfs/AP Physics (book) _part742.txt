nents of a “representative” person. Of course, there are wide variations among
people, so these data represent only a very rough average. The numbers represent
a percentage of the total height, which is regarded as 100 units; similarly, the total
mass is 100 units. For example, if a person is 1.70 m tall, his or her shoulder joint
would be
above the floor.
(1.70 m)(81.2100) = 1.38 m
