n large numbers. Because water
reacts well with other polar substances, it makes a great solvent; it can dissolve many kinds of substances. The
hydrogen bonds that hold water molecules together contribute to a number of special properties, including cohesion,
adhesion, surface tension, high heat capacity, and expansion on freezing.
Cohesion and Adhesion
As mentioned above, water molecules have a strong tendency to stick together. That is, water exhibits cohesive
forces. These forces are extremely important to life. For instance, during transpiration, water molecules evaporate
from a leaf, “pulling” on neighboring water molecules. These, in turn, draw up the molecules immediately behind
them, and so on, all the way down the plant vessels. The resulting chain of water molecules enables water to move
up the stem.
Water molecules also like to stick to other substances—that is, they’re adhesive. Have you ever tried to separate two
glass slides stuck together by a film of water? They’re diff
