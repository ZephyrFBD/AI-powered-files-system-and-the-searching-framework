WHO, which are red dots marked in Figure 2. 
As the figure shows, our model can well simulate the situation of the spread of 
Ebola without vaccines or drugs. 
Figure 2 shows the change of I(t) and S(t). Under the condition of lack of 
the medical control, the susceptible rate will continuingly decrease because of 
the death and cure of infected patient. Finally, the rate of susceptible will 
maintain a constant, but at a low lever. The infective rate increases at first, but 
decline then. The reason is that the infected people will infect the susceptible 
and the number of the infected increases. At the same time, the infected people 
will die of the disease, which will decline the infective rate. About 120 weeks 
later, the infective rate rises to the summit and then the rate begins to decrease. 
During this period, the number of people infected is smaller than the number 
of people died of the disease or recover.
