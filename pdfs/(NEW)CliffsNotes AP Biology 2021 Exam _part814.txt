emical by adding it to
cotton balls that you place at opposite ends of the chamber. You can assess the strength of the response by the
number of flies that move toward the chemical after a given amount of time (e.g., 30 seconds). For each chemical
test, you should rule out the influence of environmental variables such as light, gravity, and background colors or
motion. You can do this by evaluating fruit fly behavior with the choice chamber positioned in different orientations.
Chemicals to consider testing include the following:
1. Water. Use water as your first chemical to establish a control to which other chemicals can be compared.
If there is a significant movement toward or away from the water, evaluate the integrity of your choice chamber or
surrounding environment to determine to what, if anything, the flies are responding.
2. Alcohol. In alcohol fermentation, glucose is broken down anaerobically (in the absence of oxygen) by yeasts to
produce ethanol
 
(ethyl alcohol) and CO2.
