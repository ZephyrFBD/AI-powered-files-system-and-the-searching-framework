The work-energy principle is a very useful reformulation of Newton’s laws.
It tells us that if (positive) net work W is done on an object, the object’s kinetic
energy increases by an amount W. The principle also holds true for the reverse
situation: if the net work W done on an object is negative, the object’s kinetic
energy decreases by an amount W. That is, a net force exerted on an object oppo-
site to the object’s direction of motion decreases its speed and its kinetic energy.
An example is a moving hammer (Fig. 6–8) striking a nail. The net force on the
hammer (
in Fig. 6–8, where 
is assumed constant for simplicity) acts toward
the left, whereas the displacement of the hammer is toward the right. So the net
work done on the hammer,
is negative and the
hammer’s kinetic energy decreases (usually to zero).
Figure 6–8 also illustrates how energy can be considered the ability to 
do work. The hammer, as it slows down, does positive w
