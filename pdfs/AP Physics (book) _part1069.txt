EXERCISE F As water in a level pipe passes from a narrow cross section of pipe to a wider
cross section, how does the pressure against the walls change?
Flow and pressure in a hot-water heating system.
Water circulates throughout a house in a hot-water heating system. If the water
is pumped at a speed of 
through a 4.0-cm-diameter pipe in the base-
ment under a pressure of 3.0 atm, what will be the flow speed and pressure in a
2.6-cm-diameter pipe on the second floor 5.0 m above? Assume the pipes do not
divide into branches.
APPROACH We use the equation of continuity at constant density to determine
the flow speed on the second floor, and then Bernoulli’s equation to find the
pressure.
SOLUTION We take 
in the equation of continuity, Eq. 10–4, as the flow speed
on the second floor, and 
as the flow speed in the basement. Noting that the
areas are proportional to the radii squared
we obtain
To find the pressure on the second floor,
