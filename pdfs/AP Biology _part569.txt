particularly after a storm or from snowmelt. Oils, soaps, sewage, and
chemicals (like nitrogen and phosphorus) that run into the lake foster
the growth of algae. The algae can grow so thick that light is
blocked, and algae at the lower depths cannot survive. The lower
algae die and are decomposed by bacteria, which use up available
oxygen. The situation can get bad enough to kill fish and other
living things in the water. (ENE-1 & SYI-2)
(D) The population at D fluctuates around the carrying capacity (C)
for that environment. (SYI-1)
(C) The carrying capacity is the maximum population size that can
be supported by the available resources. It is symbolized as K.
