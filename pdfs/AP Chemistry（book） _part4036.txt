2p orbital is unhybridized. It lies perpendicular to the trigonal plane 
of the sp2 hybrid orbitals. 9.51 (a) sp2 (b) sp3 (c) sp (d) sp3 9.53 Left, 
no hybrid orbitals discussed in this chapter form angles of 90° with 
each other; p atomic orbitals are perpendicular to each other; center,

(c) A s bond is generally stronger than a p bond because there is more 
extensive orbital overlap. (d) No. Overlap of two s orbitals results in 
electron density along the internuclear axis, while a p bond has none.
