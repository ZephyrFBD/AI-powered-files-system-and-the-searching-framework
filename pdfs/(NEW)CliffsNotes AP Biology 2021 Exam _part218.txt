se, a nuclear envelope is restored around
each pole, forming two nuclei. The chromosomes within each of these nuclei disperse into chromatin, and the
nucleoli reappear.

Cytokinesis
Whereas mitosis divides the nucleus into two daughter nuclei, cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm to form two cells.
Cytokinesis differs in plants and animals by the formation of two kinds of structures, as follows:
Cell plate. In plants, vesicles originating from Golgi bodies migrate to the plane between the two newly forming
nuclei. The vesicles fuse to form a cell plate, which subsequently becomes the plasma membranes for the two
daughter cells. Cell walls develop between the membranes.
Cleavage furrow. In animals, actin filaments (microfilaments) form a ring inside the plasma membrane between the
two newly forming nuclei. As the actin filaments shorten, they act like purse strings to pull the plasma membrane
into the center, dividing the cell into two daughter cells. The groove that forms as the
