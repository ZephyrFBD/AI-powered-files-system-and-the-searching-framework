 not present in their historic range. One such unexpected species contact is between
polar bears and grizzly bears. Previously, these two species had separate ranges. Now, their ranges are overlapping and
there are documented cases of these two species mating and producing viable offspring. Changing climates also throw
off speciesâ€™ delicate timing adaptations to seasonal food resources and breeding times. Many contemporary mismatches to
shifts in resource availability and timing have already been documented.
Figure 38.16 Since 2008, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) have been spotted farther north than their historic
range, a possible consequence of climate change. As a result, grizzly bear habitat now overlaps polar bear
(Ursus maritimus) habitat. The two kinds of bears, which are capable of mating and producing viable offspring, are
considered separate species as historically they lived in different habitats and never met. However, in 2006 a hunter
shot a wild grizzly-polar bea
