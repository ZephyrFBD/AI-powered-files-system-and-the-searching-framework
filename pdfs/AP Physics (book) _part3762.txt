ing Flatness,
Uniformity, and Structure
The idea that the universe underwent a period of exponential inflation early in its
life, expanding by a factor of 
or more (previous Section), was first put forth
by Alan Guth and Andreí Linde. Many sophisticated models based on this general
idea have since been proposed. The energy required for this wild expansion may
have been due to fields somewhat like the Higgs field (Section 32–10). So far, the
evidence for inflation is indirect; yet it is a feature of most viable cosmological
models because it alone is able to provide natural explanations for several
remarkable features of our universe.

†This Standard Model prediction of a 25% primordial production of helium agrees with what we
observe today—the universe does contain about 25% He—and it is strong evidence in support of the
Standard Big Bang Model. Furthermore, the theory says that 25% He abundance is fully consistent
