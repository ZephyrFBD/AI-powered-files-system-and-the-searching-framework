Intermediate Filaments
Intermediate filaments are made of several strands of fibrous proteins that are wound together (Figure 4.24). These elements
of the cytoskeleton get their name from the fact that their diameter, 8 to 10 nm, is between those of microfilaments and
microtubules.
Figure 4.24 Intermediate filaments consist of several intertwined strands of fibrous proteins.
Intermediate filaments have no role in cell movement. Their function is purely structural. They bear tension, thus
maintaining the shape of the cell, and anchor the nucleus and other organelles in place. Figure 4.22 shows how intermediate
filaments create a supportive scaffolding inside the cell.
The intermediate filaments are the most diverse group
