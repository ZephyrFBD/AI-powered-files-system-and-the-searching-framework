empties into the body cavity. Hemolymph returns to the blood vessel through openings called ostia. Arthropods like
this bee and most mollusks have open circulatory systems.
Circulatory System Variation in Animals
The circulatory system varies from simple systems in invertebrates to more complex systems in vertebrates. The simplest
animals, such as the sponges (Porifera) and rotifers (Rotifera), do not need a circulatory system because diffusion allows
adequate exchange of water, nutrients, and waste, as well as dissolved gases, as shown in Figure 31.3a. Organisms that
are more complex but still only have two layers of cells in their body plan, such as jellies (Cnidaria) and comb jellies
(Ctenophora) also use diffusion through their epidermis and internally through the gastrovascular compartment. Both their
internal and external tissues are bathed in an aqueous environment and exchange fluids by diffusion on both sides, as
