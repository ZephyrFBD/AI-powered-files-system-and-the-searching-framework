ge, bone abnormalities, and impaired mental functioning. Heterozygous
individuals (sickle-cell trait ) are generally without symptoms, as the normal allele is sufficient to produce adequate
amounts of normal hemoglobin.
Tay-Sachs disease , usually caused by a nucleotide insertion, results when lysosomes lack the functional enzyme to
break down certain fats (glycolipids). When these fats accumulate in the nerve cells of the brain, brain cells die and
death usually follows early in childhood.
2. Aneuploidy is a genome with extra or missing chromosomes. It is most often caused by nondisjunction. Although
most aneuploid gametes do not produce viable offspring, some zygotes, with certain chromosome imbalances,
survive. These almost always lead to genetic disorders. Three examples follow:
Down syndrome occurs when an egg or sperm with an extra number 21 chromosome fuses with a normal gamete.
The result is a zygote with three copies of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21). Down syndrome individuals bea
