hen nuclei of much lighter elements 
collide with high energy. For example, in 1996 a team of European scientists based in 
Germany synthesized element 112, copernicium, Cn, by bombarding a lead target con-
tinuously for three weeks with a beam of zinc atoms:
 
208
82Pb + 70
30Zn ยก 277
112Cn + 1
0n 
[21.15]
Amazingly, their discovery was based on the detection of only one atom of the 
new element, which decays after roughly 100 ms by alpha decay to form darmstad-
tium-273 (element 110). Within one minute, another five alpha decays take place 
producing fermium-253 (element 100). The finding has been verified in both Japan 
and Russia.
Because experiments to create new elements are very complicated and produce 
only a very small number of atoms of the new elements, they need to be carefully eval-
uated and reproduced before the new element is made an official part of the periodic 
table.
