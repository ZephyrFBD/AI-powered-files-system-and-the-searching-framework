 forms, postzygotic barriers can prevent reproduction. Hybrid individuals in
many cases cannot form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages. This is called hybrid
inviability because the hybrid organisms simply are not viable. In another postzygotic situation, reproduction leads to the
birth and growth of a hybrid that is sterile and unable to reproduce offspring of their own; this is called hybrid sterility.
Habitat Influence on Speciation
Sympatric speciation may also take place in ways other than polyploidy. For example, consider a species of fish that lives in
a lake. As the population grows, competition for food also grows. Under pressure to find food, suppose that a group of these
fish had the genetic flexibility to discover and feed off another resource that was unused by the other fish. What if this new
food source was found at a different depth of the lake? Over time, those feeding on the second food source would interact
more with each other t
