various cell types able to carry out different cellular processes? Chapter 9, “Molecular Biology,” will review
how genes, the units of heredity, are able to produce traits. In short, the information stored in DNA is used to make
another nucleic acid, messenger RNA (mRNA). The information in mRNA is then used to make proteins. As
enzymes, proteins regulate chemical reactions that generate traits. Other proteins may serve to regulate gene
expression. In summary:
genes (DNA) → mRNA → proteins (enzymes) → structure, physiology, behavior
Still, this does not explain how the same set of genes can produce different kinds of structures or promote different
cellular processes. Cells become different because gene expression varies among cells; that is, in some cells genes
are turned on, while in others, those same genes are turned off. The major factor that influences which genes will be
expressed is the environment. Each cell receives chemical and physical signals from its surroundings that tri
