CHAPTER 26
The Special Theory of Relativity
70. A spaceship and its occupants have a total mass of
160,000 kg. The occupants would like to travel to a star
that is 35 light-years away at a speed of 0.70c. To accelerate,
the engine of the spaceship changes mass directly to energy.
(a) Estimate how much mass will be converted to energy
to accelerate the spaceship to this speed. (b) Assuming the
acceleration is rapid, so the speed for the entire trip can be
taken to be 0.70c, determine how long the trip will take
according to the astronauts on board.
71. In a nuclear reaction two identical particles are created,
traveling in opposite directions. If the speed of each particle
is 0.82c, relative to the laboratory frame of reference, what
is one particle’s speed relative to the other particle?
72. A 36,000-kg spaceship is to travel to the
