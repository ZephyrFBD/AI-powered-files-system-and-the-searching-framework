Enzymes can be influenced by reaction conditions such as high
temperatures, detergents, or acidic/basic conditions.

1. Researchers are studying the reaction rate of mevalonate-5-
phosphate (Mev-P), an enzyme. The graph below shows the rate
of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction as the initial concentration of
Mev-P is increased.
What would happen if the concentration of Mev-P was doubled
from 6.0 mM to 12.0 mM?

“Kinetics of Phosphomevalonate Kinase from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae,” PLoS ONE 9, no. 1 (January
2014): e87112.
The reaction rate would increase significantly.
(A)
The reaction rate would decrease sharply.
(B)
The reaction rate would not change much.
(C)
The reaction rate would change in an unpredictable way.
(D)
2. The figure below shows how the rate of an enzymatic reaction
changed as the pH of the reaction changed.
How would increasing the concentration of substrate most likely
aﬀect the rate of reaction
