Question 6 refers to the following experiment
A group of Daphnia, small crustaceans known as water fleas, was placed in one of three culture jars of different
sizes to determine their reproductive rate. There were 100 females in the jar. The graph below shows the average
number of offspring produced per female each day in each jar of pond water.
6. The data in the figure above would best support which conclusion?
(A) If you decreased the number of females, the container would have to remain constant.
(B) The number of offspring produced scales proportionally with the containerâ€™s size.
(C) The number of offspring produced increases with time.
(D) Daphnia prefer high-density conditions to have the most efficient reproductive rate.
7. Compact bone contains rings of osteons, each of which contains a central canal housing the blood vessels,
which can be accessed only by those osteocytes adjacent to it. Gap junctions, which are tunnels between
