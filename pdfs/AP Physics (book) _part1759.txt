the individual fields (call them 
etc.) due to each charge are added vecto-
rially to get the total field at that point:
The validity of this superposition principle for electric fields is fully confirmed by
experiment.

(a) Determine the direction and magnitude of the electric field at
a point P between the two charges that is 2.0 cm from the negative charge 
(Fig. 16–27a). (b) If an electron
is placed at rest at P
and then released, what will be its initial acceleration (direction and magnitude)?
