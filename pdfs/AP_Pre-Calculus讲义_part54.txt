Example 3 
Find the amount after 3 years if $1000 is invested at an interest rate of 12% per year, 
compounded continuously. 
 
 
 
 
 
If the interest is reinvested, then the new principal is P(1 + i), and the amount after another 
time period is

2.4.1 Sums, Differences, Products and Quotients 
Two functions f and g can be combined to form new functions f + g, f − g, fg, and f/g in a 
manner similar to the way we add, subtract, multiply and divide real numbers.

2.4.2 Composite Functions 
Now let’s consider a very important way of combining two functions to get a new function.
