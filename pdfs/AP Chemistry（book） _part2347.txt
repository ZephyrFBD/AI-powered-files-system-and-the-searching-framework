opes? (b) Which one decays at 
a faster rate? (c) How much of a 1.00-mg sample of each 
isotope remains after three half-lives? (d) How much of a 
1.00-mg sample of each isotope remains after 4 days?
 14.105 At 28 °C, raw milk sours in 4.0 h but takes 48 h to sour 
in a refrigerator at 5 °C. Estimate the activation energy in 
kJ>mol for the reaction that leads to the souring of milk.
 
[14.106] The following is a quote from an article in the August 18, 
1998, issue of The New York Times about the breakdown of 
cellulose and starch: “A drop of 18 degrees Fahrenheit [from 
77 °F to 59 °F4 lowers the reaction rate six times; a 36-degree 
drop [from 77 °F to 41°F] produces a fortyfold decrease in 
the rate.” (a) Calculate activation energies for the breakdown 
process based on the two estimates of the effect of tempera-
ture on rate. Are the values consistent? (b) Assuming the 
value of Ea calculated from the 36° drop and that the rate of 
breakdown is ﬁrst order with a half-life at 25 °C
