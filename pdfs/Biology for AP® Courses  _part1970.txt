servation led Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck to hypothesize that organisms adapted to
their environment by changing over time. As organisms used different parts of their body, those parts improved, and these
changes were passed down to their offspring. Ultimately, these theories were disproven by scientists, but their development
contributed to the theory of evolution that was finally formulated by Charles Darwin.
Charles Darwin and Natural Selection
In the mid-nineteenth century, the actual mechanism for evolution was independently conceived of and described by two
naturalists: Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. Importantly, each naturalist spent time exploring the natural world
on expeditions to the tropics. From 1831 to 1836, Darwin traveled around the world on H.M.S. Beagle, including stops
in South America, Australia, and the southern tip of Africa. Wallace traveled to Brazil to collect insects in the Amazon
rainforest from 1848 to 1852 and to the Malay Archipelago from 1854 to 1
