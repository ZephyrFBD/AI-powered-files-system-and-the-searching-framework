understanding of replication, transcription, and translation of DNA was
worked out using bacteria as a model. Their understanding of how viruses
and bacteria infect cells is the basis for how diseases are treated and how
vaccines are developed. A worldwide industry of genetic engineering and
recombinant DNA relies on bacteria like Escherichia coli and viruses like
the phage viruses for research and therapeutic endeavors. Whereas Gregor
Mendel depended on the garden pea and Thomas Hunt Morgan depended
on the fruit fly, researchers now depend on bacteria and viruses.
The Genetics of Viruses
A virus is a parasite that can live only inside another cell. It commandeers
the host cell machinery to transcribe and translate all the proteins it needs
to fashion new viruses. In the process, thousands of new viruses are
formed and the host cell is often destroyed. A virus consists of DNA or
RNA enclosed in a protein coat called a capsid. Some viruses also have a
viral envelope that i
