s. However, 
mosquito resistance to pyrethroids has now become widespread. Pyrethroids 
interfere with the function of a transmembrane sodium channel found in cells 
of the mosquitoes (Figure 1). In one common mutation to the channel protein, a 
phenylalanine is substituted for a leucine at amino acid position 1014. Scientists 
hypothesize that this mutation is responsible for some cases of pyrethroid resistance.
