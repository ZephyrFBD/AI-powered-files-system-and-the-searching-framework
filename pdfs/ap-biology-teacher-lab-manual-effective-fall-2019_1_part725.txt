ld you conduct to determine the 
relationship between the number of stomata and the rate of transpiration?

.
 Create a diagram with annotation to explain how the TACT (transpiration, adhesion, 
cohesion, tension) mechanism enables water and nutrients to travel up a 100-ft. tree. 
Predict how a significant increase in ambient (environmental) temperature might 
affect the rate of transpiration in this tree. Explain your prediction in terms of TACT 
and the role of guard cells in regulating the opening and closing of stomata. 
â–  Evaluating Results 
1. Was your initial hypothesis about the effect of your environmental variable on the 
rate of transpiration supported by the data you collected? Why or why not? 
2. What were some challenges you had in performing your experiment? Did you make 
any incorrect assumptions about the effect of environmental variables on the rate(s) 
of transpiration? 
3. Were you able to perform without difficulty the mathematical routines required to 
analyze y
