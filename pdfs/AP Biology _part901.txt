d to
an exposure to another antigen for the first time.
Below is a graph that depicts a first exposure to Antigen A on Day 3
with a subsequent, primary immune response. A second exposure to
Antigen A on Day 30 results in a secondary immune response due to
the presence of circulating memory cells that release antibodies
against Antigen A.

Graph A. The primary response to Antigen B is almost as fast
and large as the secondary immune response to Antigen A
because the entire immune system was activated by the first
exposure to Antigen A.
Graph B. Immune responses are specific. The fact that there
was an earlier exposure to Antigen A has no bear
