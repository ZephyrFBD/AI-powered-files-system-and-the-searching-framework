gosaccharins also play a role in plant defense against bacterial and fungal infections. They act locally at the site of
injury, and can also be transported to other tissues. Strigolactones promote seed germination in some species and inhibit
lateral apical development in the absence of auxins. Strigolactones also play a role in the establishment of mycorrhizae, a
mutualistic association of plant roots and fungi. Brassinosteroids are important to many developmental and physiological
processes. Signals between these compounds and other hormones, notably auxin and GAs, amplifies their physiological
effect. Apical dominance, seed germination, gravitropism, and resistance to freezing are all positively influenced by
hormones. Root growth and fruit dropping are inhibited by steroids.
Plant Responses to Wind and Touch
The shoot of a pea plant winds around a trellis, while a tree grows on an angle in response to strong prevailing winds. These
are examples of how plants respond to touch or wind
