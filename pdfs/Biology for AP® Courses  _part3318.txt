nside the cell. The hormone that initiates the
signaling pathway is called a first messenger, which activates a second messenger in the cytoplasm, as illustrated in Figure
28.6.
Figure 28.6 The amino acid-derived hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine bind to beta-adrenergic receptors on
the plasma membrane of cells. Hormone binding to receptor activates a G-protein, which in turn activates adenylyl
cyclase, converting ATP to cAMP. cAMP is a second messenger that mediates a cell-specific response. An enzyme
called phosphodiesterase breaks down cAMP, terminating the signal.
One very important second messenger is cyclic AMP (cAMP). When a hormone binds to its membrane receptor, a G-
protein that is associated with the receptor is activated; G-proteins are proteins separate from receptors that are found in
the cell membrane. When a hormone is not bound to the receptor, the G-protein is inactive and is bound to guanosine
diphosphate, or GDP. When a hormone binds to the receptor, the G-pro
