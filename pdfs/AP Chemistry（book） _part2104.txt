The limiting value of i can be determined for a salt from the num-
ber of ions per formula unit. For NaCl, for example, the limiting van’t 
Hoff factor is 2 because NaCl consists of one Na+ and one Cl- per formula

CHAPTER 13 Properties of Solutions
13.6 ∣ Colloids
Some substances appear to initially dissolve in a solvent, but over time, the substance 
separates from the pure solvent. For example, finely divided clay particles dispersed in 
water eventually settle out because of gravity. Gravity affects the clay particles because 
they are much larger than most molecules, consisting of thousands or even millions of 
atoms. In contrast, the dispersed particles in a true solution (ions in a salt solution or glu-
cose molecules in a sugar solution) are small. Between these extremes lie dispersed par-
ticles that are larger than typical molecules but not so large that the components of the 
mixture separate under the influence of gravity. These int
