What is the role of joints in skeletal movement?
Connection for AP® Courses
The information in this section is not within the scope for AP® and does not align with the curriculum framework. However,
the material in this section is important to understanding how joints provide stability to the skeletal system. Furthermore,
understanding the different types of joints will help one understand how the muscles are able to move bones in specific
ways.
The point at which two or more bones meet is called a joint, or articulation. Joints are responsible for movement, such as
the movement of limbs, and stability, such as the stability found in the bones of the skull.
Classification of Joints on the Basis of Structure
There are two ways to classify joints: on the basis of their structure or on the basis of their function. The structural
classification divides joints into bony, fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints depending on the material composing
