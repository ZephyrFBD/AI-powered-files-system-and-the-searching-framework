 heat of the solution.
Plan The total heat produced can be calculated using  
Equation 5.22. The number of moles of HCl consumed in the  
reaction must be calculated from the volume and molarity of 
this  
substance, and this amount is then used to determine the 
heat produced per mol HCl.
Solve
Because the total volume of the solution is 100 mL, its mass is:
∆T = 27.5 °C - 21.0 °C = 6.5 °C = 6.5 K
The temperature change is:
1100 mL211.0 g>mL2 = 100 g
Because the process occurs at constant pressure,
∆H = qP = -2.7 kJ
To express the enthalpy change on a molar basis, we use the  
fact that the number of moles of HCl is given by the product  
of the volume 150 mL = 0.050 L2 and concentration 
11.0 M = 1.0 mol>L2 of the HCl solution:
 qrxn = -Cs * m * ∆T 
 = -14.18 J>g@K21100 g216.5 K2 = -2.7 * 103 J = -2.7 kJ
Using Equation 5.22, we have:
Thus, the enthalpy change per mole of HCl is:
10.050 L211.0 mol>L2 = 0.050 mol
∆H = -2.7 kJ>0.050 mol = -54 kJ>mol
Check ∆H is negative (exothermic), as
