are usually found below the epidermis. The “strings” of
a celery stalk are an example of collenchyma cells.

plant structures. (credit: modification of work by Carl Szczerski; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
Sclerenchyma cells also provide support to the plant, but unlike collenchyma cells, many of them are dead at maturity.
There are two types of sclerenchyma cells: fibers and sclereids. Both types have secondary cell walls that are thickened
with deposits of lignin, an organic compound that is a key component of wood. Fibers are long, slender cells; sclereids are
smaller-sized. Sclereids give pears their gritty texture. Humans use sclerenchyma fibers to make linen and rope (Figure
23.7).
