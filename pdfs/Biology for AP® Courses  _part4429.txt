ogic time (time since glaciations). The predictability of climate or productivity is
also an important factor. Other factors influence species richness as well. For example, the study of island biogeography
attempts to explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains, including the Galápagos
Islands that inspired the young Darwin. Relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the
total number of individuals in all species within a habitat, ecosystem, or biome. Foundation species often have the highest
relative abundance of species.

Keystone Species
A keystone species is one whose presence is key to maintaining biodiversity within an ecosystem and to upholding an
ecological community’s structure. The intertidal sea star, Pisa
