The model is erroneously based on many
analogous traits, which have no basis in
evolutionary relationships.
c.
The model cannot be experimentally verified.
d.
The model does not consider the possibility that
genes could be transferred between unrelated
species.
17. Compare three different ways that eukaryotic cells may
have evolved.
a.
Some hypotheses propose that mitochondria
were acquired first. Others propose that the
nucleus evolved first. Still others hypothesize
that prokaryotes descended from eukaryotes by
the loss of genes and complexity.
b.
Some hypotheses propose that eukaryotic cells
are a combination of bacterial and archaeal cells.
Others propose that eukaryotic cells are a
combination of bacterial and fungal cells. Still
others hypothesize that eukaryotic and
prokaryotic cells developed independently.
c.
Some hypotheses propose that mitochondria
developed from bacterial cells. Others propose
that they developed from archaeal cells. Still
others hypothesize that bacteria d
