To evaluate the geographic isolation of invertebrate
populations in these two habitats, copepods are sampled at
the points labeled 1 and 2 on the photograph. These points
lie at either ends of the Carrying Place Inlet. Enzymes
encoded by three alleles, labeled A, B, and C, were
determined by gel electrophoresis of equal numbers of the
organisms collected at the two sites. Numbers of each
genotype are given in the following table:

B. Using a χ2 test, evaluate these data to determine if the
aminopeptidase gene in these two populations is evolving.
State your conclusion as claims supported by evidence at
both the 95% and 99% confidence levels. The formula for
the χ2 test is provided on the AP Biology Exam.
