he distorting force. (Section 12.8)
electrochemistry The branch of chemistry that deals with 
the relationships between electricity and chemical reactions. 
(Chapter 20: Introduction)
electrolysis reaction A reaction in which a nonspontaneous 
redox reaction is brought about by the passage of current 
under a sufficient external electrical potential. The devices in 
which electrolysis reactions occur are called electrolytic cells. 
(Section 20.9)
electrolyte A solute that produces ions in solution; an 
electrolytic solution conducts an electric current. (Section 4.1)
electrolytic cell A device in which a nonspontaneous oxidation–
reduction reaction is caused to occur by passage of current 
under a sufficient external electrical potential. (Section 20.9)
electromagnetic radiation (radiant energy) A form of energy that 
has wave characteristics and that propagates through a vacuum 
at the characteristic speed of 3.00 * 108 m>s. (Section 6.1)
electrometallurgy The use of electrolysis to r
