ans there is a high level of potassium in the cell and the pump makes it even more plentiful.

C
ATP inhibits its production since it inhibits phosphofructokinase. This eliminates (A) and (D). Citrate
stimulates turning fructose 1,6-bisphosphate into fructose 6-phosphate, which eliminates (B). Choice (C)
includes two things that stimulate phosphofructokinase and lead to production of fructose 1,6-
bisphosphate.

B
Insulin is needed when blood glucose gets too high. Eating a cookie would increase blood sugar more
than eating celery, fasting, or drinking water.

C
Gluconeogenesis is the formation of glucose. If the body had high insulin, then it would already have lots
of glucose, so (A) is eliminated, but if the body had high glucagon, it would need glucose, (C). High ADP
would inhibit gluconeogenesis as shown in the figure, (D). High F-2,6-BP would also inhibit
gluconeogenesis, (B).

The blastomere is shown prior to the inner cell mass; therefore, it cannot be a different
