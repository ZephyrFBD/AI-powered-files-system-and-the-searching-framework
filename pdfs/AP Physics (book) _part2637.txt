the observer and follows a
straight-line path, and represents the normal view of the distant car. Ray B is a
ray initially directed slightly downward but, instead of hitting the road, it bends
slightly as it moves through layers of air of different index of refraction. The wave
fronts, shown in blue in Fig. 24–4b, move slightly faster in the layers of (less dense)
air nearer the ground. Thus ray B is bent as shown, and seems to the observer to
be coming from below (dashed line) as if reflected off the road. Hence the mirage.
24–3 Interference—Young’s
Double-Slit Experiment
In 1801, the Englishman Thomas Young (1773–1829) obtained convincing evidence
for the wave nature of light and was even able to measure wavelengths for visible
light. Figure 24–5a shows a schematic diagram of Young’s famous double-slit
experiment. To have light from a single source, Young used the sunlight passing
through a very narrow slit in a window covering. This beam of parallel rays falls
on a screen containing
