FIGURE 7;21 Translation plus 
rotation: a wrench moving over a
smooth horizontal surface. The CM,
marked with a red cross, moves in 
a straight line because no net 
force acts on the wrench.
Figure 7–21 shows a wrench acted on by zero net force, translating and rotating
along a horizontal surface. Note that its CM, marked by a red cross, moves in a
straight line, as shown by the dashed white line.
We will show in Section 7–10 that the important properties of the CM follow from
Newton’s laws if the CM is defined in the following way. We can consider any extended
object as being made up of many tiny particles. But first we consider a system made
up
