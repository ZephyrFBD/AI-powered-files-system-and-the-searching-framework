A major reason today for building high-energy accelerators is that new par-
ticles of greater mass can be produced at higher collision energies, transforming
the kinetic energy of the colliding particles into massive particles by 
as
we will discuss shortly. Now we look at particle accelerators.
Cyclotron
The cyclotron was developed in 1930 by E. O. Lawrence (1901–1958; Fig. 32–1)
at the University of California, Berkeley. It uses a magnetic field to maintain
charged ions—usually protons—in nearly circular paths. Although particle physi-
cists no longer use simple cyclotrons, they are used in medicine for treating cancer,
and their operating principles are useful for understanding modern accelerators.
