Sulfur tetrafluoride 1SF42 reacts slowly with O2 to form sul-
fur tetrafluoride monoxide 1OSF42 according to the follow-
ing unbalanced reaction:
SF41g2 + O21g2 ยก OSF41g2
 
 
The O atom and the four F atoms in OSF4 are bonded to a 
central S atom. (a) Balance the equation. (b) Write a Lewis 
structure of OSF4 in which the formal charges of all atoms 
are zero. (c) Use average bond enthalpies (Table 8.3) to esti-
mate the enthalpy of the reaction. Is it endothermic or exo-
thermic? (d) Determine the electron
