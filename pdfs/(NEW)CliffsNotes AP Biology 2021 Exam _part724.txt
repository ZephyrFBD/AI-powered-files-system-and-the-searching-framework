acity of the habitat. Describe the
interaction of predator and prey and why population sizes fluctuate around the carrying capacity. For this question,
it is important that you supplement your discussion with graphs of each kind of population growth pattern because
they demonstrate your ability to express and interpret data in analytical form.
Question 2
a. Succession describes the series of communities that occupy an area over time. If the process begins on a newly
exposed surface, it is called primary succession. If it occurs on a substrate previously supporting life, such as is the
case with most lakes, then it is called secondary succession. Succession occurs because each community changes the
habitat in such a way that it becomes more suitable to new species. Soil, light, and other growing conditions change
as each community occupies a region. The final, climax community is a stable community that remains unchanged
until destroyed by some catastrophic event, such as fire. Then the
