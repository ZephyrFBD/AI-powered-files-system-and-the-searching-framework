by scattering high-speed electrons off nuclei. It is found that nuclei
have a roughly spherical shape with a radius that increases with A according to
the approximate formula
(30;1)
Since the volume of a sphere is
we see that the volume of a nucleus is
approximately proportional to the number of nucleons,
(because
).
This is what we would expect if nucleons were like impenetrable billiard balls: if
you double the number of balls, you double the total volume. Hence, all nuclei
have nearly the same density, and it is enormous (see Example 30–2).
The metric abbreviation for 
is the fermi (after Enrico Fermi,
Fig. 30–7) or the femtometer, fm (see Table 1–4 or inside the front cover). Thus
