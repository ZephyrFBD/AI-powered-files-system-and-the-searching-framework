es FSH and LH at
puberty by secreting of GnRH. FSH stimulates
the Leydig cells in the testes and LH stimulates
the Sertoli cells to synthesize and secrete
testosterone.
b.
The hypothalamus releases FSH and LH at
puberty by the secretion of GHRH. FSH
stimulates the Sertoli cells in the testes and LH
stimulates the Leydig cells to synthesize and
secrete testosterone.
c.
The hypothalamus stimulates the release of FSH
and LH at puberty by secreting of GnRH. FSH
stimulates the Sertoli cells in the testes and LH
stimulates the Leydig cells to synthesize and
secrete testosterone.
d.
The hypothalamus releases TSH and LH at
puberty by the secretion of GnRH. TSH
stimulates the Sertoli cells in the testes and LH
stimulates the Leydig cells to synthesize and
secrete testosterone.
