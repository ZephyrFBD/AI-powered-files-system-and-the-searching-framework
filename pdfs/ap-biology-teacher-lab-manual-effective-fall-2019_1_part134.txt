uld be a central part of your 
experience in AP Biology. Performing labs also gives you insight into the nature of 
science, and helps you appreciate the investigations and processes that result in the 
collection of facts that your textbook and your teacher often present to you. 
This suite of AP Biology laboratory investigations helps you gain enduring 
understandings of biological concepts and the scientific evidence that supports them. 
The investigations allow you to develop and apply practices and skills used by scientists. 
You make observations, ask questions, and then design plans for experiments, data 
collection, application of mathematical routines, and refinement of testable explanations 
and predictions. As you work through your experiments, your teacher will ask 
follow-up questions to assess how well you understand key concepts. Finally, you will 
communicate your findings and your interpretation of them to your classmates and 
instructor(s).
