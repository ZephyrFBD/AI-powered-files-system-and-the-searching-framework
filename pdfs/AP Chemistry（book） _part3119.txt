anges increase, decrease, or 
have no effect on the number of microstates available to a 
system: (a) increase in temperature, (b) decrease in volume, 
(c) change of state from liquid to gas?
 19.32  (a) Using the heat of vaporization in Appendix B, calculate 
the entropy change for the vaporization of water at 25 °C 
and at 100 °C. (b) From your knowledge of microstates and 
the structure of liquid water, explain the difference in these 
two values.
 19.33  (a) What do you expect for the sign of ∆S in a chemical 
reaction in which 2 mol of gaseous reactants are converted 
to 3 mol of gaseous products? (b) For which of the processes 
in Exercise 19.11 does the entropy of the system increase?
 19.34  (a) In a chemical reaction, two gases combine to form 
a solid. What do you expect for the sign of ∆S? (b) How 
does the entropy of the system change in the processes 
described in Exercise 19.12?
 19.35  Does the entropy of the system increase, decrease, or stay 
the same when (a) a solid
