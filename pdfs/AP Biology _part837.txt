a in which scientists have inserted a gene that
produces human insulin. This insulin is not similar to human insulin; it is
human insulin. Several scientists took many years to figure out how to
accomplish this. However, now it is done routinely.
Genes have been inserted in bacteria so the bacteria can “eat” oil and
clean up major oil spills. Rice has been genetically modified to produce
more protein. Cows have been genetically engineered to produce more
milk. You may have seen the term GMO—genetically modified organism
—on milk cartons or some other foods. The term means that the organism
or food has been modified by altering its genes—by adding a foreign gene
into its genome.
The science of inserting genes into a cell of an organism depends on
small circles of exogenous DNA called plasmids that were first discovered
in bacteria. Scientists insert a particular gene into a plasmid and then insert
the plasmid into a bacterial cell. The host cell begins to produce the
proteins encoded by
