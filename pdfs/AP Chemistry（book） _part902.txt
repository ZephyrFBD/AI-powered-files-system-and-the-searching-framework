physics? Bohr approached this problem in much the same way that Planck 
had approached the problem of the nature of the radiation emitted by hot objects: He 
assumed that the prevailing laws of physics were inadequate to describe all aspects of 
atoms. Furthermore, he adopted Planck’s idea that energies are quantized.
Bohr based his model on three postulates:
 1. Only orbits of certain radii, corresponding to certain specific energies, are  
permitted 
for the electron in a hydrogen atom.
 2. An electron in a permitted orbit is in an “allowed” energy state. An electron in an 
allowed energy state does not radiate energy and, therefore, does not spiral into the 
nucleus.
 3. Energy is emitted or absorbed by the electron only as the electron changes from one 
allowed energy state to another. This energy is emitted or absorbed as a  
photon that 
has energy E = hn.
