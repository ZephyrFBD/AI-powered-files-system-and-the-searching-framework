A species of marine snail is found in shallow waters near
coastlines. This snail feeds on detritus on the ocean
bottom. Researchers noticed that snails in one area had a
mottled appearance, while snails in another area were solid
in color. The researchers set up areas in each region for
study and then released both mottled and solid snails into
the solid snail region and released both mottled and solid
snails into the mottled snail region. The survival rate of
each variant was measured. Results are summarized in this
table. Construct a possible hypothesis that accounts for
these data. Explain your reasoning.

A possible hypothesis is that the coloration of
the snail is dependent on environmental
