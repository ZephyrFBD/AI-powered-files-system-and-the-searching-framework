r the treatment group, you submerge leaves in a bicarbonate
 
solution (to supply CO2). For the control group, you submerge leaves in a
solution without bicarbonate. Here is a brief summary of the procedure:
1. Cut disks of leaf tissue from leaves using a hole punch.
2. Fill one beaker with a bicarbonate solution. Fill a second beaker with a solution without bicarbonate. Add a drop
of soap into each solution, as it will reduce the hydrophobic characteristic of the leaf’s cuticle and will facilitate
submerging the leaf disks.
3. Use a syringe to remove the gases that fill the air spaces in the spongy mesophyll. For each treatment, withdraw
the plunger of a syringe, insert the cut leaf disks, and replace the plunger. For the treatment group, add bicarbonate
solution (taken from the beaker) by dipping the syringe into the beaker and pulling on the syringe. Repeat for the
control group, except use the solution without bicarbonate.
4. Submerge each group of disks into its respective beaker—
