Standard deviation (SD) is a tool for measuring the deviation or
variability from the mean in the sample population. In turn, this provides
an estimate of the variation from the mean in the entire population from
which the sample was taken. A large sample standard deviation indicates
that the data have a lot of deviation from the mean. A small sample
standard deviation indicates that the data are clustered close to the sample
mean. On a graph that shows a normal distribution, about 68% of the data
points will fall between +1 standard deviation and −1 standard deviation
from the sample mean. More than 95% of the data will fall between ±2
standard deviations from the sample mean. See the graph that follows.
Standard error (SE) is a statistic that indicates the reliability of the
mean, or how well the sample mean matches up to the true population
mean. A small SE is an indication that the sample mean is a more accurate
reflection of the actual populat
