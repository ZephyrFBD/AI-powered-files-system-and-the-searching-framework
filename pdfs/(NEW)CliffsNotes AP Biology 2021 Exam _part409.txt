allowing the nonsusceptible individuals to reproduce rapidly without
competition.
2. Sexual reproduction creates individuals with new combinations of alleles. These rearrangements, or genetic
recombinations, originate from three events during the sexual reproductive process, as follows. 
Crossing over, or exchanges of DNA between nonsister chromatids of homologous chromosomes, occurs during
prophase I of meiosis.
Independent assortment of homologues during metaphase I creates daughter cells with random combinations of
maternal and paternal chromosomes.
Random joining of gametes during fertilization contributes to the diversity of gene combinations in the zygote.
3. Diploidy is the presence of two copies of each chromosome in a cell. In the heterozygous condition (when two
different alleles for a single gene locus are present), the recessive allele is hidden from natural selection allowing
variation to be “stored” for future generations. As a result, more variation is maintained in the
