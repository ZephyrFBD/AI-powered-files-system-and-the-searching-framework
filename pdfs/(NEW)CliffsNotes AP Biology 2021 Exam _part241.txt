phase II, these two chromosomes would line up on the metaphase plate. When anaphase II begins, each of
the chromosomes would split into two chromatids. One of each of these chromatids (now called chromosomes)
would migrate to one or the other pole.
13. B. If the cell began with four chromosomes, then after meiosis I, each daughter cell would have two complete
chromosomes. At metaphase II, the two chromosomes would align, unpaired, on the metaphase plate.
14. A. Only in mitosis would you see four chromosomes spread out, unpaired, on the metaphase plate. If this were
metaphase I, the chromosomes would appear in pairs; if metaphase II, there would be only two chromosomes.
15. D. The pairing of homologous chromosomes occurs only in meiosis and at metaphase I.

1. During chromosome alignment in meiosis I (metaphase I), homologous chromosomes pair on the equatorial plate
and subsequently homologues separate to opposite poles. In
