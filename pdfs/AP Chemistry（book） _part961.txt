med with knowledge of the relative energies of orbitals and the Pauli exclusion prin-
ciple, we are in a position to consider the arrangements of electrons in atoms. The way 
electrons are distributed among the various orbitals of an atom is called the electron 
configuration of the atom.
The most stable electron configuration—the ground state—is that in which the elec-
trons are in the lowest possible energy states. If there were no restrictions on the possible 
values for the quantum numbers of the electrons, all the electrons would crowd into the 
1s orbital because it is the lowest in energy (Figure 6.25). The Pauli exclusion principle 
Give It Some Thought
In a many-electron atom, can we predict unambiguously whether the 4s orbital is 
lower or higher in energy than the 3d orbitals?

behaves as if it were spinning about an axis, 
thereby generating a magnetic field whose 
direction depends on the direction of spin.
