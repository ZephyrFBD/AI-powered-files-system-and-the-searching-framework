All the above aberrations occur for monochromatic light and hence are
referred to as monochromatic aberrations. Normal light is not monochromatic,
and there will also be chromatic aberration. This aberration arises because of
dispersion—the variation of index of refraction of transparent materials with
wavelength (Section 24–4). For example, blue light is bent more than red light by
glass. So if white light is incident on a lens, the different colors are focused at
different points, Fig. 25–27, and have slightly different magnifications resulting in
colored fringes in the image. Chromatic aberration can be eliminated for any two
colors (and reduced greatly for all others) by the use of two lenses made of
different materials with different indices of refraction and dispersion. N
