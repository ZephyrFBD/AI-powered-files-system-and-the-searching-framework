 To initiate transcription, RNA
polymerase must bind to the promoter. This process requires the
assistance of transcription factors, whose presence or absence enables or
inhibits transcription.
Regulation at the Post-Transcriptional Regulation Level
Alternative RNA splicing is an important means of regulating gene
expression in which different mRNA molecules are produced from the
same primary transcript, depending on which RNA segments are treated
as introns (intervening sequences) and which are treated as exons
(expressed sequences). Regulatory proteins specific to a cell type control
intron-exon choices by binding to RNA sequences within the primary
transcript. It has been estimated that 90% of human-protein coding genes
are subject to alternative splicing. (See Figure 9.7.)

Degradation of mRNA
The span of time after gene transcription before the degradation of
mRNA is another opportunity to regulate gene expression. Bacterial
