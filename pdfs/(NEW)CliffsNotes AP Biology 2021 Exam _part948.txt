chloroplasts do not function independently from the eukaryotic host cell. Some of the
ancestral mitochondria and chloroplast genes are now located in the genome of the host cell. Thus, respiration and
photosynthesis cannot occur without the manufacture of necessary enzymes by the host genome.
26. A. The graph shows that the cuvette with the higher concentration of substrate (succinate) has a higher rate of
respiration. The vertical axis of the graph records the percent transmittance of the solution; the greater the
transmittance, the more reduced DPIP in the cuvette, and the greater amount of respiration. Since the y-axis
represents respiration and the x- axis represents time, the respiratory rate is the slope of a plotted line.
(Note that rate means a change in a variable with time, or 
 , graphically represented by the slope of a plotted line.)
27. B. Pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, is the initial substrate for the Krebs cycle. All of the steps of the Krebs
cycle that normally r
