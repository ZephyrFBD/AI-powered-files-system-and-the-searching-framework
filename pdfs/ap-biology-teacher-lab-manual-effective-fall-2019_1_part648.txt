 in grams of each plant. This is the 
individual plant biomass. They should record their answers to the following questions  
in their lab notebooks (see Table 1): 
•  What is the mean value for all the dry seven-day-old Fast Plants? 
•  What percentage of the average mass of a living seven-day-old Fast Plant comes  
from water? 
•  What percentage comes from the dry mass (biomass)? (Note: You might want to 
remind students that this percentage will be used later. Students should indicate in 
their notebooks the range or variation in the data set with appropriate analysis. In 
particular, they should consider range, standard deviation, and standard error.)
