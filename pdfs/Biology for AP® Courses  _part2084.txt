in all the females.
b.
The very fittest organisms are not necessarily the
ones that survive. Sometimes it is the least fit
organisms that survive and reproduce. For
example, in one generation the mice who are bad
at foraging for seeds may reproduce prolifically
and dominate the mice who are good at foraging.
In this case, natural selection will select for the
less-fit phenotype and spread it in the
population.
c.
The definition of fitness is not correct. The
strongest and fastest organisms are more fit than
the weaker and slower ones, but large
individuals are often at a disadvantage to smaller
ones because they are easily spotted by
predators. For example, a large rabbit will stick
out on a field more than a small one and will get
eaten by a hawk.
d.
What is meant by “fittest” is not necessarily
strong, large, and fast. Fitness, as defined in
evolutionary terms, has to do with survival and
the reproduction of genetic material. For
example, a small but showy male bird may be
selected b
