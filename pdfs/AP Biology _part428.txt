genetics, published in 1865, would have given Darwin an
understanding of why variation occurs in a population. However,
the ramifications of Mendel’s theories were not understood until
many years after he presented them.)
Only the best-fit individuals survive and get to pass on their
traits to offspring.
Evolution occurs as advantageous traits accumulate in a
population. No individual organism changes in response to
pressure from the environment. Rather, the frequency of an allele
within a population changes.
How the Giraffe Got Its Long Neck
According to Darwin’s theory, ancestral giraffes were short-necked
animals although neck length varied from individual to individual. As the
population of animals competing for the limited food supply increased, the
taller individuals had a better chance of surviving than those with shorter
necks. Over time, the proportion of giraffes in the population with longer
necks increased until only long-necked giraffes existed.
