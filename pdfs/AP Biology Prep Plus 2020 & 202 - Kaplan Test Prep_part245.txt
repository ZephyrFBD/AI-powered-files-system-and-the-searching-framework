6. A researcher decides to compare the response of two plants to
desiccation by growing them in a hot, dry environmental chamber
and then returning the chamber to normal climate conditions.
One plant showed a dramatic increase in transpiration relative to
its initial transpiration rate as the environment became drier, but
then reverted to a normal transpiration rate when the normal
climate was restored. The other plant showed a much smaller
change in transpiration relative to its initial transpiration rate
under the same conditions. What conclusion can most likely be
drawn from these results?
Answers to this quiz can be found at the end of this chapter.
The plant that had a smaller change in transpiration probably
normally lives in a moist environment and had water
reserves. In contrast, the plant that had a larger change in
transpiration is a xerophyte, a plant that is adapted to a dry
environment.
