ed to use crystal-field splitting diagrams from the 
text to determine which complex has which geometry.
Plan We need to determine the number of d electrons in Ni2+ and 
then use Figure 23.33 for the tetrahedral complex and Figure 23.34 
for the square-planar complex.
Solve Nickel(II) has the electron configuration 3Ar43d8. With 
very few exceptions tetrahedral complexes are high spin and 
square-planar complexes are low spin. Therefore, the population 
of the d orbitals in the two geometries is
dx2−y2

Tetrahedral

The tetrahedral complex has two unpaired electrons, and the 
square-planar complex has none. We know from Section 23.1 that 
the tetrahedral complex must be paramagnetic and the square pla-
nar must be diamagnetic. Therefore, 3NiCl442- is tetrahedral, and 
3Ni(CN)442- is square planar.
Comment Nickel(II) forms octahedral complexes more frequently 
than square-planar ones, whereas d8 metals from periods 5 and
