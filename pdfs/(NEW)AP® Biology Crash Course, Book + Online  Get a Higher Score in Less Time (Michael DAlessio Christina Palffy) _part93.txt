1. Purines—adenine (A) and guanine (G), consist of two rings.
2. Pyrimidines—thymine (T) and cytosine (C) have a single ring.
D. Complementary pairing—the complementary pairing of nitrogenous bases is the basis of the double-
stranded structure of a DNA molecule.
1. Base pairing involves the formation of hydrogen bonds between the bases that are located toward the
center of each DNA molecule, and they serve to hold the two strands together.
i.
Hydrogen bonds are weaker than covalent bonds, allowing the two strands of the DNA molecule
to be separated for DNA replication and transcription.
ii. A pyrimidine can only pair with a purine due to their sizes and the types of hydrogen bonds
possible between the bases.
2. Base pairing occurs along the entire length of the two DNA strands and results in one strand being an
exact complement of the other.
3. Knowing the sequence of one strand of DNA, the sequence of its complement can be deduced by the
use of the base pairing rules.
