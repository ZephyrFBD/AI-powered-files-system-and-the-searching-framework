of the throw, so we set  
and we assume  
is in the horizontal direction. We ignore all other
forces on the ball during this brief time interval, such as gravity, in comparison
to the force exerted by the tennis racket.
SOLUTION The force exerted on the ball by the racket is
This is a large force, larger than the weight of a 60-kg person, which would
require a force  
to lift.
NOTE The force of gravity acting on the tennis ball is
which justifies our ignoring it compared to the enormous force the
racket exerts.
NOTE High-speed photography and radar can give us an estimate of the contact
time and the velocity of the ball leaving the racket. But a direct measure-
ment of the force is not practical. Our calculation shows a handy technique for 
determining an unknown force in the real world.
