In a real situation, the roller-coaster car in Fig. 6â€“18, for example, will not in fact
reach the same height on the second hill as it had on the first hill because of fric-
tion. In this, and in other natural processes, the mechanical energy (sum of the
kinetic and potential energies) does not remain constant but decreases. Because
frictional forces reduce the mechanical energy (but not the total energy), they are
called dissipative forces. Historically, the presence of dissipative forces hindered
the formulation of a comprehensive conservation of energy law until well into 
the nineteenth century. It was only then that heat, which is always produced
when there is friction (try rubbing your hands together), was interpreted in terms
of energy. Quantitative studies by nineteenth-century scientists (discussed in
Chapters 14 and 15) demonstrated that if heat is considered as a transfer of
energy (thermal energy), then the total energy is conserved in any process. For
