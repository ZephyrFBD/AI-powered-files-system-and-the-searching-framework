 Notice that the term 10.26 atm is the pressure corrected 
for molecular volume. This value is higher than the ideal value, 
10.00 atm, because the volume in which the molecules are free 
to move is smaller than the container volume, 22.41 L. Thus, the 
molecules collide more frequently with the container walls and 
the pressure is higher than that of a real gas. The term 1.29 atm 
makes a correction in the opposite direction for intermolecular 
forces. The correction for intermolecular forces is the larger of the 
two, and thus the pressure 8.97 atm is smaller than would be  
observed for an ideal gas.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Calculate the pressure of a 2.975-mol sample of N2 in a 
0.7500-L flask at 300.0 °C using the van der Waals equation 
and then repeat the calculation using the ideal-gas equation. 
Within the limits of the significant figures justified by these 
parameters, will the ideal-gas equation overestimate or un-
derestimate the pressure, and if so by how much?
