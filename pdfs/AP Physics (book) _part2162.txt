ction to a ground has
broken (or was not there in the first place). If a nurse touches
the bed and the patient at the same time, the nurse becomes
a conductor and a complete circuit can be made through the
patient to ground through the ECG apparatus. This is shown
schematically in Fig.19â€“75. Calculate the current through the
patient.
71. A heart pacemaker is designed to operate at 
using a 
capacitor in a simple RC circuit. What value of
resistance should be used if the pacemaker is to fire (capac-
itor discharge) when the voltage reaches 75% of maximum
and then drops to 0 V (72 times a minute)?
6.5-mF
72 beatsmin
75. The internal resistance of a 1.35-V mercury cell is 
whereas that of a 1.5-V dry cell is 
Explain why
three mercury cells can more effectively power a 2.5-W
hearing aid that requires 4.0 V than can three dry cells.
76. How many
resistors, each of the same resistance, must
be used to produce an equivalent 
3.5-W resistor?
What is the resistance of each, and how must they
