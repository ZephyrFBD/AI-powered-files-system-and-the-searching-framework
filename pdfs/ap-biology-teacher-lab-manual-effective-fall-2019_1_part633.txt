cabbage white butterflies (Pieris rapae). Methods for estimating the efficiency of transfer 
of energy from producer to consumer are also introduced. Together, these model 
organisms and methods create a rich, accessible research environment that facilitates

student exploration of basic ecological concepts of energy flow, the role of producers, the 
role of primary consumers, and the complex interactions between organisms. 
The first portion of this laboratory investigation, Getting Started, serves as a prelab 
activity designed to help students establish a context for energy dynamics in living 
systems. The analogy of accounting or budgeting provides the students with a useful tool 
to guide their questions and strategies for investigating those questions.
