eria, fungi, plants, and animals. Viruses consist of a nucleic acid core surrounded by a protein capsid with or
without an outer lipid envelope. The capsid shape, presence of an envelope, and core composition dictate some elements
of the classification of viruses. The most commonly used classification method, the Baltimore classification, categorizes
viruses based on how they produce their mRNA.

Viral replication within a living cell always produces changes in the cell, sometimes resulting in cell death and sometimes
slowly killing the infected cells. There are six basic stages in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration,
uncoating, replication, assembly, and release. A viral infection may be productive, resulting in new virions, or
nonproductive, which means that the virus remains inside the cell without producing new virions. Bacteriophag
