30. Describe the process of Southern blotting.
a.
Southern Blotting is used to find DNA
sequences. Fragments are separated on gel,
incubated with probes to check for the sequence
of interest, and transferred to a nylon membrane.

Southern blotting is used to find DNA
sequences. Fragments are separated on gel,
transferred to a nylon membrane, and incubated
with probes to check for the sequence of interest.
c.
When RNA is used, the process is called
Northern blotting.
d.
