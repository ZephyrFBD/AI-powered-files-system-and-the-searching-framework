plete normal development. In contrast, daughter cells produced
by a determinate cleavage cannot develop into a complete embryo if separated from other cells. Instead, their
developmental program is limited to the production of definite (or determined) cells that contribute to only a part of
a complete embryo. Because cytoplasmic influences can be narrowed by each successive cell division, cells are
more likely to be determined later in the developmental sequence than earlier.
2. Influence of the egg cytoplasm (cytoplasmic determinants). Cytoplasmic material is distributed unequally in
the egg (or in subsequent daughter cells). When cleavages divide the egg, the quality of cytoplasmic substances will
vary among the daughter cells. Nonuniform distribution of cytoplasm results in embryonic axes. In addition,
substances unique to certain daughter cells may promote gene expression that turns on (or off) genes specific to the
development and differentiation of that cell.
