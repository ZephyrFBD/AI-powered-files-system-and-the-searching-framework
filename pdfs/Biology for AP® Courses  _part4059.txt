include ovaries, oviducts, the uterus, and the vagina, shown in Figure 34.12. The
pair of ovaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments. Ovaries consist of a medulla and cortex:
the medulla contains nerves and blood vessels to supply the cortex with nutrients and remove waste. The outer layers of
cells of the cortex are the functional parts of the ovaries. The cortex is made up of follicular cells that surround eggs that
develop during fetal development in utero. During the menstrual period, a batch of follicular cells develops and prepares
the eggs for release. At ovulation, one follicle ruptures and one egg is released, as illustrated in Figure 34.13a.
Figure 34.13 Oocytes develop in (a) follicles, located in the ovary. At the beginning of the menstrual cycle, the follicle
matures. At ovulation, the follicle ruptures, releasing the egg. The follicle becomes a corpus luteum, which eventually
degenerates. The (b) follicle in this light micrograph has an oocy
