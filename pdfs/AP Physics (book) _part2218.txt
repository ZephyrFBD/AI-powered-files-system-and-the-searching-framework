 the other when the current is
on, so we can apply Eq. 20–7.
SOLUTION Equation 20–7 gives
The currents are in opposite directions (one toward the appliance, the other away
from it), so the force would be repulsive and tend to spread the wires apart.

of a solenoid. The north pole of this
solenoid, thought of as a magnet, is
on the right, and the south pole is on
the left. (b) Photo of iron filings

The field is smoother if the loops are
closely spaced.

Definition of the Ampere and the Coulomb
You may have wondered how the constant 
in Eq. 20–6 could be exactly
Here is how it happened. With an older definition of the
ampere,
was measured experimentally to be very close to this value. Today,
is defined to be exactly
This could not be done if the amp
