 Frankie, Frankie, you’re bringin’ the cough on me.Will you dance 
 
 for the love o’ Jesus so I can remember me youth with your mother in 
 
 the Wembley Hall.Take off the feckin’ shoe, Frankie, an’ dance. 
 
 I have to make up dances and tunes to go with them the way I did 
 
 a long time ago when I was young. I dance around the room with one 
 
 shoe because I forgot to take it off. I try to make up words, Oh,The 
 
 Walls of Limerick are falling down, falling down, falling down, The 
 
 Walls of Limerick falling down and the River Shannon kills us. 
 
 Mr. Clohessy is laughing in the bed. Oh, Jaysus, I never heard likes 
 
 o’ that on land or sea.That’s a great leg for the dancing you have there, 
 
 Frankie. Oh, Jaysus. He coughs and brings up ropes of green and yellow 
 
  
  
 stuff. It makes me sick to look at it and I wonder if I should go home 
 
 from all this sickness and this bucket and let my parents kill me if they 
 
 want to.
