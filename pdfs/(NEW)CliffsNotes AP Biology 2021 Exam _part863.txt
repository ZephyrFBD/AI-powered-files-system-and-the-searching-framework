1. In peas, the allele for yellow seed color (Y) is dominant to the allele for green seed color (y). A student crossed
plants that came from yellow seeds with plants that came from green seeds. He believed that the yellow seeds were
heterozygous. The observed results are reported in the following table.
Calculate the chi-squared (Ï‡2) value for the null
hypothesis that the
 
yellow seed plants were heterozygous. Express your answer to the nearest tenth.
 
2. In a classroom investigation, students filled two bottles with pond water containing only photosynthesizing
organisms. They used a
 
dissolved oxygen (DO2) sensor to measure the amount of dissolved
 
oxygen in each bottle. One bottle was put under a light. The second bottle was wrapped with aluminum foil to block
all light and was put
 
under the same light. After 24 hours, pond water DO2 in the two bottles was again measured. Average values for
DO2 from all students are
