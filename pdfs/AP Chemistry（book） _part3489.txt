right portion of the periodic table. This division of elements relates nicely to trends in 
their properties as summarized in Figure 22.1. Electronegativity, for example, increases 
as we move left to right across a period and decreases as we move down a group. The 
nonmetals thus have higher electronegativities than the metals. This difference leads 
to the formation of ionic solids in reactions between metals and nonmetals. 
 (Sec-
tions 7.6, 8.2, and 8.4) In contrast, compounds formed between two or more nonmet-
als are usually molecular substances.
