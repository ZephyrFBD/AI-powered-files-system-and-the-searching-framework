elative number of molecules
with kinetic energy above a particular value (such as 
in Fig. 13â€“20) increases
with temperature. This is in accord with the well-known observation that the
evaporation rate is greater at higher temperatures.
Because it is the fastest molecules that escape from the surface, the average
speed of those remaining is less. When the average speed is less, the absolute tem-
perature is less. Thus kinetic theory predicts that evaporation is a cooling process.
You may have noticed this effect when you stepped out of a warm shower and
felt cold as the water on your body began to evaporate; and after working up a
sweat on a hot day, even a slight breeze makes you feel cool through evaporation.
Try licking your finger and then blow on it.
Vapor Pressure
Air normally contains water vapor (water in the gas phase), and it comes mainly
from evaporation. To look at this process in a little more detail, consider a closed
container that is partially filled with water (or anot
