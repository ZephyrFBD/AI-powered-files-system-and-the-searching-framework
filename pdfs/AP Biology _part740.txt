that identify the cells as self. No two people, except identical twins, have
the same MHC markers. There are two main classes of MHC markers:
class I and class II.
Class I MHC molecules are found on the surfaces of every
nucleated body cell. They signal the immune system that they are
“self,” not foreign.
Class II MHC molecules are found on specialized cells, including
macrophages, B cells, dendritic cells, and activated T cells; see
Figure 17.1.
 
APCs have both MHCI and MHCII on the cell surface.

REMEMBER
Cells communicate with each other through direct contact with other cells or from a distance
via chemical signaling.
 
APCs: Antigen-Presenting Cells
APCs do just what their name says. They present an antigen or a piece of

an antigen, an epitope, to the immune system. In effect, they are saying,
“Here is the enemy!” The process begins when an APC—a m
