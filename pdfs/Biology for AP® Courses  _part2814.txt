Animal Bioenergetics
All animals must obtain their energy from food they ingest or absorb. These nutrients are converted to adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) for short-term storage and use by all cells. Some animals store energy for slightly longer times as
glycogen, and others store energy for much longer times in the form of triglycerides housed in specialized adipose tissues.
No energy system is one hundred percent efficient, and an animalâ€™s metabolism produces waste energy in the form of heat.
If an animal can conserve that heat and maintain a relatively constant body temperature, it is classified as a warm-blooded
animal and called an endot
