d chemiosmosis. Chemiosmosis is also used in mitochondria to generate ATP during cellular respiration,
which will be reviewed in Chapter 9.

The electron from the ETC (that is now on PSI) is boosted by another photon of light energy from the sun. The
electron again passes through a series of carriers, although much shorter than that of the ETC, where it is finally
transferred, along with a proton, to NADP+ by the enzyme NADP+ reductase. This produces a molecule of NADPH
as shown in Figure 8.4, which will provide reducing power for the light-independent reactions.

Light-Independent Reactions (The Calvin Cycle)
The light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle) occur in the stroma of the chloroplast, which is the
liquid surrounding the stacks of thylakoids. The Calvin cycle, as shown in Figure 8.5, is a complicated, multistep
process that can be broken down into three main par
