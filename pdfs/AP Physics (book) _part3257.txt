e of the possible arrangements of atoms in a crystal: simple cubic,
face-centered cubic, and body-centered cubic. The NaCl crystal lattice is shown 
in Fig. 29–20.
The molecules of a solid are held together in a number of ways. The most
common are by covalent bonding (such as between the carbon atoms of the diamond
crystal) and by ionic bonding (as in a NaCl crystal). Often the bonds are partially
covalent and partially ionic. Our discussion of these bonds earlier in this Chapter
for molecules applies equally well to solids.
Let us look for a moment at the NaCl crystal of Fig. 29–20. Each 
ion
feels an attractive Coulomb potential due to each of the six “nearest neighbor”
ions surrounding it. Note that one 
does not “belong” exclusively to 
one 
so we must not think of ionic solids as consisting of individual mole-
cules. Each 
also feels a repulsive Coulomb potential due to other 
ions,
although this is weaker since the 
ions are farther away.
A different type of bond occurs in metals
