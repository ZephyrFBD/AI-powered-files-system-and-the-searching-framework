etween joules 
and kilojoules to make the units of ∆H° and ∆S° match.
Calculate ∆G at 298 K for a mixture of 1.0 atm N2, 3.0 atm H2, and 0.50 atm NH3 being used in the Haber process:
N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ∆2 NH31g2
Solve 
The partial-pressures form of Equation 15.24 gives:
Analyze We are asked to calculate ∆G under nonstandard 
conditions.
Plan We can use Equation 19.19 to calculate ∆G. Doing so 
requires that we calculate the value of the reaction quotient Q 
for the specified partial pressures, for which we use the  
partial-pressures form of Equation 15.24 (the equilibrium con-
stant expression). We then use a table of standard free energies 
of formation to evaluate ∆G°.
