 mass) is swung in a vertical circle. (a) Deter-
mine the minimum speed the ball must have at the top of its arc so that the ball
continues moving in a circle. (b) Calculate the tension in the cord at the bottom
of the arc, assuming the ball is moving at twice the speed of part (a).
APPROACH The ball moves in a vertical circle and is not undergoing uniform
circular motion. The radius is assumed constant, but the speed v changes
because of gravity. Nonetheless, Eq. 5–1  
is valid at each point along
the circle, and we use it at the top and bottom points. The free-body diagram is
shown in Fig. 5–8 for both positions.
SOLUTION (a) At the top (point 1), two forces act on the ball:
the force of
gravity, and
the tension force the cord exerts at point 1. Both act down-
ward, and their vector sum acts to give the ball its centripetal acceleration 
We apply Newton’s second law, for the vertical direction, choosing downward as
positive since the acceleration is downward (toward the center):
