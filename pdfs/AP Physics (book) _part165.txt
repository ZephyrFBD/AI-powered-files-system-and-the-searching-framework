he car to travel 
5. The physics: the car, starting from rest
at 
increases in speed as it
covers more distance. The acceleration is constant, so we can use the kine-
matic equations, Eqs. 2–11.
6. Equations: we want to find the time, given the distance and acceleration;
Eq. 2–11b is perfect since the only unknown quantity is 
Setting
and 
in Eq. 2–11b
we have
We solve for by multiplying both sides by
:
Taking the square root, we get :
7. The calculation:
This is our answer. Note that the units come out correctly.
8. We can check the reasonableness of the answer by doing an alternate calcu-
lation: we first find the final velocity
and then find the distance traveled 
which checks with our given distance.
9. We checked the units in step 7, and they came out correctly (seconds).
NOTE In steps 6 and 7, when we took the square root, we should have written
Mathematically there are two solutions. But the
second solution,
is a time before our chosen time interval and
makes no sense physically
