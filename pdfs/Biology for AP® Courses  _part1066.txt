signaling systems that allow for the efficient inner workings
that keep humans and other complex life forms functioning correctly.
Kinases are a major component of cellular communication, and studies of these enzymes illustrate the
evolutionary connectivity of different species. Yeasts have 130 types of kinases. More complex organisms
such as nematode worms and fruit flies have 454 and 239 kinases, respectively. Of the 130 kinase types
in yeast, 97 belong to the 55 subfamilies of kinases that are found in other eukaryotic organisms. The
only obvious deficiency seen in yeasts is the complete absence of tyrosine kinases. It is hypothesized that
phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is needed to control the more sophisticated functions of development,
differentiation, and cellular communication used in multicellular organisms.
Because yeasts contain many of the same classes of signaling proteins as humans, these organisms
are ideal for studying signaling cascades. Yeasts multiply quickly a
