2 and 3 and how are their functions related?
Structure 2 is the nucleoprotein that acts as a protective
coating for structure 3, the capsid, which contains the genetic
material of the virus.
(A)
Structure 3 is the lipid envelope that acts as a protective
coating for structure 2, the capsid, which contains the genetic
material of the virus.
(B)
Structure 2 is the lipid envelope that acts as a protective
coating for structure 3, the neuraminidase, which contains
the genetic material of the virus.
(C)
Structure 2 is the lipid envelope that acts as a protective
coating for structure 3, the capsid, which contains the genetic
material of the virus.
