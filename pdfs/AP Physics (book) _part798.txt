out 
(a) How many degrees is this? (b) How small an object can the bird just distin-
guish when flying at a height of 100 m (Fig. 8–2a)?
APPROACH For (a) we use the relation 
For (b) we use Eq.8–1b,
to find the arc length.
SOLUTION (a) We convert 
to degrees:
(b) We use Eq. 8–1b,
For small angles, the arc length and the chord
length are approximately† the same (Fig. 8–2b). Since
and
we find
A bird can distinguish a small mouse (about 3 cm long) from a height of 100 m.
That is good eyesight.
NOTE Had the angle been given in degrees, we would first have had to convert
it to radians to make this calculation. Equations 8–1 are valid only if the angle is
specified in radians. Degrees (or revolutions) won’t work.
To describe rotational motion, we make use of angular quantities, such as
angular velocity and angular acceleration. These are defined in analogy to the
corresponding quantities in linear motion, and are chosen to describe the rotat-
ing object as a whole, so they are the same for e
