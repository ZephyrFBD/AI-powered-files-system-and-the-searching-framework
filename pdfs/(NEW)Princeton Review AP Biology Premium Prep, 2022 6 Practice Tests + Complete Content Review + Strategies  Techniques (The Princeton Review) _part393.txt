hic events can speed up natural selection and adaptation. When
the rules change, sometimes odd variations are selected for. Earth has undergone several mass extinction events. The
tree of life would look much different if these events had not occurred.
Genetic drift is something that causes a change in the genetics of a population, but it is not natural selection.
Instead, it is caused by random events that drastically reduce the number of individuals in a population. Often called
the bottleneck effect or the founder effect, this occurs when only a few individuals are left to mate and regrow a
population. If those individuals were the only survivors due to random luck, that means that the alleles that are
present to regrow the population are just random alleles. They are not necessarily the fittest alleles. For example, if a
hurricane swept through and only 4 birds were left on an island, the traits that they have will be the traits of the
population going forward, even if those traits
