58. Two different plant species expend approximately the
same amount of energy on reproduction, yet one produces

Explain what is likely to be true of the seeds of these two

In the plant species that produces many seeds,
most of the energy is used to produce seeds, of
which only a few will germinate and produce
another plant. In the species that produces few
seeds, most of the energy is used to increase the
chances of seeds produced to germinate and
grow into an adult plant.
