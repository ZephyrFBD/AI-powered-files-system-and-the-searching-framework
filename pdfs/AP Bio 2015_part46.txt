 Prairie dogs are small mammals that live in large 
colonies in burrows in the ground. Prairie dogs 
that are near their own relatives when a predator 
approaches are much more likely to issue a 
warning bark than those that are near unrelated 
prairie dogs. The prairie dogs that hear a warning 
bark are more likely to hide in their burrows than 
to remain above ground. However, the prairie dog 
that gives the warning bark is putting itself at 
increased risk of being identified and killed by the 
predator.
