amu
88.0 amu = 2
Consequently, we multiply the subscripts in the empirical formula by this multiple, 
 
giving the molecular formula: C6H8O6.
 
(3) We determine the simplest whole-number ratio of moles by dividing each number of moles by the smallest number of moles.

C :  3.407
3.406 = 1.000 H : 4.54
3.406 = 1.33 O : 3.406
3.406 = 1.000
The ratio for H is too far from 1 to attribute the difference to experimental error; in fact, it is quite close to 11
3. This suggests we should 
multiply the ratios by 3 to obtain whole numbers:
C : H : O = 13 * 1 : 3 * 1.33 : 3 * 12 = 13 : 4 : 32
Thus, the empirical formula is C3H4O3.
