 by the problem in other parts of the world—especially 
in Bangladesh, where the problem is tragic. Historically, surface 
water sources in that country have been contaminated with 
microorganisms, causing signiﬁcant health problems. During the 
1970s, international agencies, headed by the United Nations Chil-
dren’s Fund (UNICEF), began investing millions of dollars of aid 
money in Bangladesh for wells to provide “clean” drinking water. 
Unfortunately, no one tested the well water for the presence of arse-
nic; the problem was not discovered until the 1980s. The result has 
been the biggest outbreak of mass poisoning in history. Up to half 
of the country’s estimated 10 million wells have arsenic concentra-
tions above 50 ppb.
In water, the most common forms of arsenic are the arse-
nate ion and its protonated hydrogen anions (AsO4
