chanisms of natural selection. Differential
reproductive success in different environments results in changes in populations.
Artificial Selection
Individuals in a population can also experience differential reproductive success through artificial selection. In
artificial selection, humans selectively breed domesticated plants or animals to produce populations with desired
traits. Instead of the environment selecting for individuals with favorable phenotypes, humans select which
individuals in a population survive and reproduce.
An example of artificial selection in plants can be seen in Brassica oleracea wild cabbage. Over the years,
farmers have selectively bred wild cabbage for desired traits, as shown in Figure 19.6. By selectively breeding plants
with bigger leaves, farmers have developed kale. Selecting for plants with more flower clusters led to cauliflower.
Crossbreeding plants with lateral buds has produced Brussels sprouts. Broccoli was produced by selectively
breeding plants
