-out Examples, including
an Approach and Solution, which should be studied as an integral part of 
the text; (b) some of the worked-out Examples are Estimation Examples,
which show how rough or approximate results can be obtained even if 
the given data are sparse (see Section 1–7); (c) Problem Solving Strategies
placed throughout the text to suggest a step-by-step approach to problem
solving for a particular topic—but remember that the basics remain the
same; most of these “Strategies” are followed by an Example that is solved
by explicitly following the suggested steps; (d) special problem-solving
Sections; (e) “Problem Solving” marginal notes which refer to hints within
the text for solving Problems; (f) Exercises within the text that you should
work out immediately, and then check your response against the answer
given at the bottom of the last page of that Chapter; (g) the Problems them-
selves at the end of each Chapter (point 4 above).
