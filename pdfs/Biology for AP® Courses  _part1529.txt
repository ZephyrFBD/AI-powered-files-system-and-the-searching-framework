 bond between the 3'-OH end and the 5' phosphate
of the next nucleotide. This essentially means that it cannot add nucleotides if a free 3'-OH group is not available. Then how
does it add the first nucleotide? The problem is solved with the help of a primer that provides the free 3'-OH end. Another
enzyme, RNA primase, synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the
DNA. Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis, it is appropriately called the primer. DNA polymerase can now
extend this RNA primer, adding nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand (Figure 14.14).

Figure 14.14 A replication fork is formed when helicase separates the DNA strands at the origin of replication.
The DNA tends to become more highly coiled ahead of the replication fork. Topoisomerase breaks and reforms
DNAâ€™s phosphate backbone ahead of the replication fork, thereby relieving the pressure that
