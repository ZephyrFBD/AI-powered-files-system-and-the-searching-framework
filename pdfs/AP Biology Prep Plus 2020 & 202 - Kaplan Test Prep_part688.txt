raphic area. Sympatric speciation requires some other
form of reproductive isolation, such as those previously mentioned.
Parapatric speciation is less definitive. This occurs when two
populations are able to interbreed along a border, but the exchange of
alleles is negligible compared to the amount of genetic exchange
occurring within each population. A narrow zone of hybridization exists at
the meeting of the two populations, but the two populations never
coalesce into one.
A variety of factors such as species interactions, environmental changes,
and population size can lead to extinctionâ€”the termination of an
organism or species. For two species whose niches overlap, typically the
species that is better adapted will drive the other species to extinction.
Human activities (for example, hunting, habitat destruction, introduction
of disease, and changing the climate) have become a predominant cause
of extinction.
Species that are unable to adapt to a changing environment may die out
