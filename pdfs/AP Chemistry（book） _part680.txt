THERMOCHEMISTRY
◀ THERMITE REACTION. The reaction between aluminum metal and 
iron oxide produces aluminum oxide and iron metal. It also generates 
enough heat to melt the iron metal formed in the reaction. The thermite 
reaction is a dramatic illustration of how potential energy stored in 
chemical bonds can be converted to heat.
 
5.1  ▶ The Nature of Chemical 
Energy Learn that chemical energy 
is a form of potential energy that arises 
largely from the electrostatic interactions 
of charged particles at the atomic level. 
Describe energy changes associated with 
chemical reactions by defining the reactants 
and products as the system and everything 
else in the universe as the surroundings.
 
5.2  ▶ The First Law of Thermodynamics 
 
Explore the first law of thermodynamics, 
which states that energy cannot be created 
or destroyed but can be transformed from 
one form to anoth
