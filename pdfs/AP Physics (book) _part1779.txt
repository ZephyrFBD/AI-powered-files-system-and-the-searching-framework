 forces—that is,
by the attraction of positive charges to negative charges that exist on parts of the
molecules. We see in Fig. 16–39a that an A (adenine) on one strand is always oppo-
site a T on the other strand; similarly, a G is always opposite a C. This important
ordering effect occurs because the shapes of A, T, C, and G are such that a T fits
closely only into an A, and a G into a C. Only in the case of this close proximity of
the charged portions is the electrostatic force great enough to hold them together
even for a short time (Fig. 16–39b), forming what are referred to as “weak bonds.”
