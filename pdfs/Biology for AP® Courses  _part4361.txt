4.13 The student is able to predict the effects of a change in the communityâ€™s populations on
the community.
Although life histories describe the way many characteristics of a population (such as their age structure) change over time
in a general way, population ecologists make use of a variety of methods to model population dynamics mathematically.
These more precise models can then be used to accurately describe changes occurring in a population and better predict
future changes. Certain models that have been accepted for decades are now being modified or even abandoned due to their
lack of predictive ability, and scholars strive to create effective new models.
