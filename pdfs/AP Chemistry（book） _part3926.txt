f this molecule.
 24.73  Indicate whether each statement is true or false: (a) Fat 
molecules contain amide bonds. (b) Phosphoplipids can 
be zwitterions. (c) Phospholipids form bilayers in water in 
order to have their long hydrophobic tails interact favor-
ably with each other, leaving their polar heads to the aque-
ous environment.
 24.74  Indicate whether each statement is true or false: (a) If you use 
data from Table 8.3 on bond enthalpies, you can show that 
the more C ¬ H bonds a molecule has compared to C ¬ O 
and O¬H bonds, the more energy it can store. (b) Trans fats 
are saturated. (c) Fatty acids are long-chain carboxylic acids. 
(d) Monounsaturated fatty acids have one CC single bond in 
the chain, while the rest are double or triple bonds.
Nucleic Acids (section 24.10)
 24.75  Adenine and guanine are members of a class of molecules 
known as purines; they have two rings in their structure. 
Thymine and cytosine, on the other hand, are pyrimidines, 
and have only one ring
