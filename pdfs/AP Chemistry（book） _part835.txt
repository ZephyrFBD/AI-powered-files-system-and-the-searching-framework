t absorbs 824 J of heat from 
its surroundings and has 0.65 kJ of P–V work done on it by 
its surroundings. What are the values of ∆H and ∆E for this 
process?
 5.38 A gas is confined to a cylinder under constant atmospheric 
pressure, as illustrated in Figure 5.4. When 0.49 kJ of heat is 
added to the gas, it expands and does 214 J of work on the 
surroundings. What are the values of ∆H and ∆E for this 
process?
 5.39 The complete combustion of ethanol, C2H5OH1l2, to form 
H2O1g2 and CO21g2 at constant pressure releases 1235 kJ of 
heat per mole of C2H5OH. (a) Write a balanced thermochem-
ical equation for this reaction. (b) Draw an enthalpy diagram 
for the reaction.
 5.40 The decomposition of Ca1OH221s2 into CaO(s) and H2O1g2 
at constant pressure requires the addition of 109 kJ of heat 
per mole of Ca1OH22. (a) Write a balanced thermochemical 
equation for the reaction. (b) Draw an enthalpy diagram for 
the reaction.
