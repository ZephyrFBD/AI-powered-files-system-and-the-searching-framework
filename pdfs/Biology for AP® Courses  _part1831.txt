acA will produce a protein that will
transfer an acetyl group to Î² galactosidase.
d.
Transcription will continue but lactose will not
be metabolized properly.
29. In some diseases, alteration to epigenetic modifications
turns off genes that are normally expressed.
Hypothetically, how could you reverse this process to turn
these genes back on?
30. Flowering Locus C (FLC) is a gene that is responsible
for flowering in certain plants. FLC is expressed in new
seedlings, which prevents flowering. Upon exposure to
cold temperatures, FLC expression decreases and the plant
flowers. FLC is regulated through epigenetic
modifications. What type of epigenetic modifications are
present in new seedlings and after cold exposure?
a.
In new seedlings, histone acetylations are
present; upon cold exposure, methylation occurs.
b.
In new seedlings, histone deacetylations are
present; upon cold exposure, methylation occurs.
c.
In new seedlings, histone methylations are
present; upon cold exposure, acetylati
