Structural changes around a 
double bond in the retinal portion of the molecule trigger a series of 
chemical reactions that result in vision.
We know that a double bond between two atoms is stronger 
than a single bond between those same two atoms (Table 8.3). We are 
now in a position to appreciate another aspect of double bonds: They 
introduce rigidity into molecules.
Consider the C ¬C double bond in ethylene. Imagine rotating 
one ¬CH2 group in ethylene relative to the other ¬ CH2 group, 
as pictured in Figure 9.29. This rotation destroys the overlap of the 
 
p orbitals, breaking the p bond, a process that requires considerable 
energy. Thus, the presence of a double bond restricts bond rotation
