In any graph of the distribution of molecular speeds in a gas sample, the peak of 
the curve represents the most probable speed, ump [Figure 10.12(b)]. The most prob-
able speeds in Figure 10.12(a), for instance, are 4 * 102 m>s for the 0 °C sample and 
5 * 102 m>s for the 100 °C sample. Figure 10.12(b) also shows the root-mean-square 
(rms) speed, urms, of the molecules. This is the speed of a molecule possessing a kinetic 
energy identical to the average kinetic energy of the sample. The rms speed is not quite 
the same as the average (mean) speed, uav. The difference between the two is small, how-
ever. In Figure 10.12(b), for example, the root-mean-square speed is about 4.9 * 102 m>s 
and the average speed is about 4.5 * 102 m>s.
If you calculate the rms speeds (as we will in Section 10.8), you will find that the rms 
speed is almost 6 * 102 m>
