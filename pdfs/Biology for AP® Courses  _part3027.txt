73. We need an explanation of the common experience
that an "upset stomach" (functional dyspepsia) or
constipation can result from stress. Irritable bowel
syndrome is a chronic gastrointestinal disease and is
treated with the neurotransmitter serotonin. Serotonin
receptors are located on the cell membranes of neurons
and activate second messenger cascades that regulate gene
expression. In humans most serotonin is synthesized in
neurons that enervate smooth muscle cells lining the
gastrointestinal tract. There is an association of serotonin
with a sense of well-being.
A. Based on these data, justify the claim that timing of
the passage of food in the gastrointestinal tract is regulated
by serotonin.
The effect of serotonin on smooth muscle is a clue but it
doesn't provide a mechanism connecting stress to the
symptoms of functional dyspepsia. Serotonin is
