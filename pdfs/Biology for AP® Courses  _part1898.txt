nated at different points. The DNA is separated on the basis of size, and these bands, based on
the size of the fragments, can be read.
Early Strategies: Shotgun Sequencing and Pair-Wise End Sequencing
In shotgun sequencing method, several copies of a DNA fragment are cut randomly into many smaller pieces (somewhat
like what happens to a round shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun). All of the segments are then sequenced using
the chain-sequencing method. Then, with the help of a computer, the fragments are analyzed to see where their sequences
overlap. By matching up overlapping sequences at the end of each fragment, the entire DNA sequence can be reformed.
A larger sequence that is assembled from overlapping shorter sequences is called a contig. As an analogy, consider that
someone has four copies of a landscape photograph that you have never seen before and know nothing about how it should
appear. The person then rips up each photograph with their hands, so that different size pi
