Body size was larger when temperatures were colder and smaller
when temperatures were warmer. Thus, body size decreases when

inversely correlated with ambient temperature. (C) is incorrect
because it states the opposite of what occurs. (D) is incorrect because

Thyroid hormone production is regulated by a negative feedback loop.
If insuï¬€icient iodine is available to produce thyroxine, the anterior

(C) is incorrect because the thyroxine precursors do not form new
