 answering how the drug targets
bacterial DNA. Likewise, histones are only found in eukaryotes, and
lysosomes are found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, meaning
neither (B) nor (C) could explain why the drug targets only bacterial DNA.
3. A
As stated in the question, mitochondrial inheritance is maternal, meaning
that if the mother is aﬀected by the disorder, then all oﬀspring will be
aﬀected as well. Since males don’t pass on mitochondria to oﬀspring, an
aﬀected male will have unaﬀected oﬀspring. (A) is the only pedigree that
shows this pattern of inheritance. The pattern of inheritance shown in (B)
is X-linked dominant, in (C) is autosomal recessive, and in (D) is X-linked
recessive.

Since the student noticed a membrane-bound nucleus in the cell, the
organism must be a eukaryote. While eukaryotes do have free-floating
ribosomes, they also possess membrane-bound ribosomes in a region of
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) referred to as the rough ER. Therefore, the
student would ob
