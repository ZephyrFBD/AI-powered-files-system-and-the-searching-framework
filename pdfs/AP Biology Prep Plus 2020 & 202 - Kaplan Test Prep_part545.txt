AP EXPERT NOTE
Replication always adds new nucleotides in the 5′ to 3′ direction—
no exceptions! To help you remember, use the mnemonic device:
You read up on a topic and write down your notes. Polymerase
reads up (3′ to 5′) and writes down (5′ to 3′).
MUTATIONS
DNA Replication
The goal of a cell is usually to maintain the same code in its DNA, base
pair by base pair. Sometimes changes occur spontaneously during
replication or are due to environmental factors such as irradiation. These
changes in the DNA code are called mutations. Mutations can involve a
change in only one base or several bases. Mutations are also placed in
one of two categories, base-pair substitutions or insertions and deletions.
Base-pair substitutions occur when one base pair is incorrectly
reproduced and exchanged with a diﬀerent base pair. An insertion is
when any number of extra base pairs are added to the code, and a
deletion is when any number are removed from the code.
