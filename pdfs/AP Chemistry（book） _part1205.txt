acter than does cesium. (ii) The ﬁrst ionization energy of 
cesium is less than that of sodium. (iii) The electron affinity 
of sodium is smaller than that of cesium. (iv) The effective 
nuclear charge for cesium is less than that of sodium. (v) The 
atomic radius of cesium is smaller than that of sodium.
 7.104  (a) One of the alkali metals reacts with oxygen to form a solid 
white substance. When this substance is dissolved in water, 
the solution gives a positive test for hydrogen peroxide, H2O2. 
When the solution is tested in a burner ﬂame, a lilac-purple 
ﬂame is produced. What is the likely identity of the metal? 
(b) Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction of 
the white substance with water.
 7.105  Zinc in its 2+ oxidation state is an essential metal ion for life. 
Zn2+ is found bound to many proteins that are involved in 
biological processes, but unfortunately Zn2+ is hard to detect 
by common chemical methods. Therefore, scientists wh
