ph of pressure P vs. volume V, a PV diagram, would
follow a curve like AB in Fig. 15–2 for an isothermal process. Each point on the
curve, such as point A, represents the state of the system at a given moment—
that is, its pressure P and volume V. At a lower temperature, another isothermal
process would be represented by a curve like 
in Fig. 15–2 (the product
is less when T is less). The curves shown in Fig. 15–2
are referred to as isotherms.
We assume the gas is in contact with a heat reservoir (a body whose mass is so
large that, ideally, its temperature does not change significantly when heat is exchanged
with our system). We also assume that a process of compression (volume decrease) 
or expansion (volume increase) is done very slowly, so that the process can be
considered a series of equilibrium states all at the same constant temperature.†
