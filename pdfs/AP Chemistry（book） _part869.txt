tal kinetic energy of 1 mol of N2 molecules moving at this 
speed?
 5.119 Suppose an Olympic diver who weighs 52.0 kg executes a 
straight dive from a 10-m platform. At the apex of the dive, 
the diver is 10.8 m above the surface of the water. (a) What 
 
is the potential energy of the diver at the apex of the dive, 
relative to the surface of the water? (b) Assuming that all the 
potential energy of the diver is converted into kinetic energy 
at the surface of the water, at what speed, in m>s, will the 
diver enter the water? (c) Does the diver do work on entering 
the water? Explain.
 5.120 Consider the combustion of a single molecule of CH41g2, 
forming H2O1l2 as a product. (a) How much energy, in J, 
is produced during this reaction? (b) A typical X-ray light 
source has an energy of 8 keV (see inside back cover for 
conversion between eV and J). Is the energy released by the 
combustion of a CH4 molecule larger or smaller than the en-
ergy of an X-ray from this source?
