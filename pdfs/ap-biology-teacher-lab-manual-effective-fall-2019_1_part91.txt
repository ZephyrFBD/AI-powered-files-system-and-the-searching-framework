■ Graphing, Mapping, and Ordering 
Students need to graph different data sets, and graphing by scatter plots is an ordinary 
scientific activity (see Figure 2).

Temperature (˚F) from Cricket Chirps 
Figure 2. Sample Scatter Plot Graph. Often we would like a straight-line relationship 
between our predicted value (temperature) based on actual measurements of another 
variable (number of chirps) and our observed value (temperature). 
The more data students graph, the sooner students begin to understand that certain 
plot shapes or forms are easily associated with models that make it easier to infer 
causal mechanisms. For example, a bell-shaped curve (see Figure 3) is associated with 
random samples and normal dis
