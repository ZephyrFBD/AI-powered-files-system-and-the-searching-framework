ect is moving but also to its direction. A quantity such as velocity, which has
direction as well as magnitude, is a vector quantity. Other quantities that are also
vectors are displacement, force, and momentum. However, many quantities have no
direction associated with them, such as mass, time, and temperature. They are speci-
fied completely by a number and units. Such quantities are called scalar quantities.
Drawing a diagram of a particular physical situation is always helpful in
physics, and this is especially true when dealing with vectors. On a diagram, each
vector is represented by an arrow. The arrow is always drawn so that it points in
the direction of the vector quantity it represents. The length of the arrow is drawn
proportional to the magnitude of the vector quantity. For example, in Fig. 3–1,
green arrows have been drawn representing the velocity of a car at various places
as it rounds a curve. The magnitude of the velocity at each point can be read off
