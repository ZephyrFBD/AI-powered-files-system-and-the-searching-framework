u2+ is E °
red (cathode). Know-
ing E °
cell and E °
red (anode), we can use Equation 20.8 to solve for 
E °
red (cathode).

1.10 V = E°
red 1cathode2 - 1-0.76 V2
 
E°
red 1cathode2 = 1.10 V - 0.76 V = 0.34 V
Check This standard reduction potential agrees with the one listed 
in Table 20.1.
Comment The standard reduction potential for Cu2+ can be rep-
resented as E°
Cu2+ = 0.34 V and that for Zn2+ as E°
Zn2+ = -0.76 V. 
The subscript identifies the ion that is reduced in the reduction 
half-reaction.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
A voltaic cell based on the reaction 
2 Eu2+1aq2 + Ni2+1aq2 ¡ 2 Eu3+1aq2 + Ni1s2 generates 
E°
cell = 0.07 V. Given the standard reduction potential of 
Ni2+ given in Table 20.1, what is the standard reduction 
potential for the reaction Eu3+1aq2 + e- ¡ Eu2+1aq2?  
(a) -0.35 V (b) 0.35 V (c) -0.21 V (d) 0.21
