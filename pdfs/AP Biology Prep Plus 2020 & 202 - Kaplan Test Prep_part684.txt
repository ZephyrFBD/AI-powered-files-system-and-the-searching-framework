the same principles of filtration and active transport to excrete
waste products from the body, and fish, protists, and bacteria use
analogous osmoregulatory mechanisms to control water and solute
concentrations in order to maintain internal water balance. Similar
morphological features (for example, skeletal components of vertebrates)
can also be seen across living organisms. Homologous structures,
however, may or may not be used for the same function. Vestigial
structures like the wings of a flightless bird have lost their original
function. Phylogenetic trees, which represent evolutionary relationships,
also provide evidence for common descent and are discussed in chapter
17.
Genetic Driƞ and Gene Flow
Biodiversity arises from genetic driȇ, a random sampling process that
occurs in small populations. Two examples of genetic driȇ are the
bottleneck eﬀect and the founder eﬀect. The bottleneck eﬀect generally
occurs when a catastrophe like a natural disaster leaves behind only a
small g
