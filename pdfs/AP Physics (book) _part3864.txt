ulate in the theory of relativity). That is, light traveling in 
with speed
will have speed 
in S, according to Eq.E–2, whereas the theory of
relativity insists it must be c in S. Clearly, then, a new set of transformation equa-
tions is needed to deal with relativistic velocities.
We will derive the required equations, again looking at Fig. E–1. We assume
the transformation is linear and for x is of the form
(i)
That is, we modify the first of Eqs.E–1 by multiplying by a factor which is yet to
be determined.† We assume the y and z equations are unchanged 
because there is no length contraction in these directions. We will not assume a
form for , but will derive it. The inverse equations must have the same form with
v replaced by
(The principle of relativity demands it, since 
moving to the
right with respect to S is equivalent to S moving to the left with respect to 
)
Therefore

Suppose a light pulse leaves the common origin of S and 
at time t = t¿ = 0.
