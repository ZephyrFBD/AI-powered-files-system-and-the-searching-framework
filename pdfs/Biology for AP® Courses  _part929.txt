water, releasing oxygen into the atmosphere; the electrons released from the oxidation of water replace the electrons that
were boosted from the reaction center chlorophyll. As the electrons from the reaction center chlorophyll pass through the
series of electron carrier proteins, hydrogen ions (H+) are pumped across the membrane via chemiosmosis into the interior
of the thylakoid. (If this sounds familiar, it should. We studied chemiosmosis in our exploration of cellular respiration
in Cellular Respiration.) This action builds up a high concentration of H+ ions, and as they flow through ATP synthase,
molecules of ATP are formed. These molecules of ATP will be used to provide free energy for the synthesis of carbohydrate
in the Calvin cycle, the second stage of photosynthesis. The electron transport chain connects PS II and PS I. Similar to the
events occurring in PS II, this second photosystem absorbs a second photon of light, resulting in the formation of a molecule
of NADPH fro
