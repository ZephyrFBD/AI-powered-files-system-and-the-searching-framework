ing emitted by the cathode traveled across to the opposite end of the
tube. These “somethings” were named cathode rays.
There was much discussion at the time about what these rays might be. Some
scientists thought they might resemble light. But the observation that the bright
spot at the end of the tube could be deflected to one side by an electric or magnetic
field suggested that cathode rays were charged particles; and the direction of the
deflection was consistent with a negative charge. Furthermore, if the tube con-
tained certain types of rarefied gas, the path of the cathode rays was made visible
by a slight glow.
Estimates of the charge e of the cathode-ray particles, as well as of their
charge-to-mass ratio 
had been made by 1897. But in that year, J. J. Thomson
(1856–1940) was able to measure 
directly, using the apparatus shown in 
Fig. 27–2. Cathode rays are accelerated by a high voltage and then pass between
a pair of parallel plates built into the tube. Another voltage app
