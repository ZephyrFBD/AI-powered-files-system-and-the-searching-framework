the rate of respiration and
communication between the different organ
systems.
c.
Different regions of the kidneys have specialized
cells that respond to chemical messengers and
hormones like epinephrine, renin, aldosterone,
ADH, and ANP. These regulate the rate of
respiration and communication between the
different organ systems.
d.
Different regions of the nephrons have
specialized cells that respond to chemical
messengers and hormones like epinephrine,
renin, aldosterone, ADH, and ANP. These
regulate the needs of the body and
communication between the different organ
systems.
42. How does the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
mechanism function?
Chapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion

a.
Renin, which is secreted by part of the
juxtaglomerular complex, acts on angiotensin to
form angiotensin I, which is then converted to
angiotensin II by ACE. Angiotensin II then
stimulates the release of aldosterone and ADH.
Angiotensin II acts to destabilize blood pressure
and volume.

Ren
