Making ice. A freezer has a COP of 2.8 and uses 200 watts
of power. How long would it take to freeze an ice-cube tray that contains 600 g
of water at 0°C?
APPROACH In Eq. 15–6b,
is the heat that must be transferred out of the
water so it will become ice. To determine 
we use the latent heat of fusion L
of water and Eq. 14–4,
SOLUTION From Table 14–3,
for water. Hence
is the total energy that needs to be removed from the water. The freezer does
work at the rate of
which is the work W it can do in
seconds. We solve for :
For W, we can also use Eq. 15–6b:
Thus
or about 6 min.
