1. Lymnaea stagnalis snails can have leȇ-coiling (sinistral) or right-
coiling (dextral) shells, shown in the figure as A and B,
respectively.
Although researchers know that shell development is heavily
influenced by genetics, they are interested in the eﬀects of the
environment on shell development as well. To study this,
researchers could raise snails in diﬀerent laboratory
environments. Which of the following possibilities would be least
likely from crosses of true-breeding, male, leȇ-coiling snails and
true-breeding, female, right-coiling snails?

Aȇer the oﬀspring were randomly divided into groups to be
raised in two diﬀerent laboratory environments, those in one
environment all resembled type A, while those in the other
environment all resembled type B.
