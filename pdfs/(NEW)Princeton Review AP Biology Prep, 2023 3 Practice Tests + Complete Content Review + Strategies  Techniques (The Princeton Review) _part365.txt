RNA viruses have extremely high rates of
mutation because they lack proofreading mechanisms when they replicate their genomes. This high rate of mutation
will create lots of variety, which makes these viruses difficult to treat. They evolve quickly, as drug-resistant
mutations become naturally selected. New drugs must constantly be identified to treat the resistance.
Viruses can sometimes change quickly if two viruses infect the same cell. The gene segments of each virus can
recombine and mix with each other and package into mixed viruses that are a chimera of the original two viruses.
This can increase genetic variation among viruses.

Recombinant DNA
Scientists have learned how to harness the Central Dogma in order to research and cure diseases. Recombinant
DNA is generated by combining DNA from multiple sources to create a unique DNA molecule that is not found in
nature. A common application of recombinant DNA technology is the introduction of a eukaryotic gene of inter
