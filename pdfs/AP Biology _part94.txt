Receptor-mediated endocytosis enables a cell to take up
large quantities of very specific substances. It is a process by
which extracellular substances bind to receptors on the cell
membrane. Once the ligand (the general name for any
molecule that binds specifically to a receptor site of another
molecule) binds to the receptors, endocytosis begins. The
receptors, carrying the ligand, migrate and cluster along the
membrane, turn inward, and become a coated vesicle that
enters the cell. This is the way cells take in cholesterol from
the blood; see Figure 3.20.

Bulk Flow
Bulk flow is a general term for the overall movement of a fluid in one
direction in an organism. In humans, blood moves around the body by
bulk flow as a result of blood pressure created by the pumping he
