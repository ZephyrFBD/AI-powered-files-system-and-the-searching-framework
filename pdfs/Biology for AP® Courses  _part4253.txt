째C above the norm. Although 0.10 째C does not seem large enough to produce any noticeable change, it did free
seas of ice. Because of this warming, the Vikings were able to colonize Greenland.
The Little Ice Age was a cold period that occurred between 1550 AD and 1850 AD. During this time, a slight cooling of
a little less than 1 째C was observed in North America, Europe, and possibly other areas of the Earth. This 1 째C change in
global temperature is a seemingly small deviation in temperature (as was observed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly);
however, it also resulted in noticeable changes. Historical accounts reveal a time of exceptionally harsh winters with much
snow and frost.
The Industrial Revolution, which began around 1750, was characterized by changes in much of human society. Advances
in agriculture increased the food supply, which improved the standard of living for people in Europe and the United States.
New technologies were invented and provided jobs and cheaper goods.
