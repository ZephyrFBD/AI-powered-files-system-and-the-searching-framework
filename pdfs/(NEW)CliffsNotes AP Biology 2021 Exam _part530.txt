es, but recognition sites for molecules displayed by nonself cells. Self and nonself cells are distinguished
as follows:
The MHC markers on the plasma membrane of cells distinguish between self and nonself cells.
When a body cell is invaded by a virus, by a foreign cell, or by any antigen, the body cell displays a combination of
self and nonself markers. T cells interpret this aberrant display of markers as nonself.
Cancer cells or tissue transplant cells, or other cells that display aberrant markers, are recognized as nonself cells by
T cells. When T cells encounter nonself cells, they divide and produce two kinds of cells, as follows:
Cytotoxic T cells (or killer T cells) recognize and destroy nonself cells by puncturing them, thus causing them to
lyse.
Helper T cells stimulate the proliferation of B cells and cytotoxic T cells.
When an antigen binds to a B cell or when a nonself cell binds to a T cell, the B cell or T cell begins to divide,
producing numerous daughter cells, all ide
