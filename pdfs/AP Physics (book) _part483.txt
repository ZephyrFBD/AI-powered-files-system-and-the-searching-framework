 The centripetal
acceleration is horizontal (not
parallel to the sloping road). The
friction force on the tires, not 
shown, could point up or down 
along the slope, depending on the
carâ€™s speed. The friction force will 
be zero for one particular speed.
EXERCISE D To negotiate a flat (unbanked) curve at a faster speed, a driver puts a couple
of sand bags in his van aiming to increase the force of friction between the tires and the
road. Will the sand bags help?
Banking angle. (a) For a car traveling with speed v around
a curve of radius r, determine a formula for the angle at which a road should 
be banked so that no friction is required. (b) What is this angle for a road which
has a curve of radius 50 m with a design speed of 
APPROACH Even though the road is banked, the car is still moving along a
horizontal circle, so the centripetal acceleration needs to be horizontal. We
choose our x and y axes as horizontal and vertical so that 
which is hori-
zontal, is along the x axis. The fo
