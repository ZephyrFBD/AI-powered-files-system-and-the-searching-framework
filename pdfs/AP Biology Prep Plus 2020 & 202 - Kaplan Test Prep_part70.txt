ration. Animals
use cellular respiration to synthesize ATP from molecules in food,
giving oﬀ CO2 as a byproduct. (D) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect
because it describes decomposition, in which dead plants and animals
are broken down by bacteria. (B) is incorrect because it describes the
process of photosynthesis, which actually removes carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere and which is not performed by animals. (C) is
incorrect because it describes the formation of fossil fuels.

Living systems require a continuous input of energy to maintain their
ordered state. During the process of maintaining order (dynamic
homeostasis), some energy is transferred to the surroundings, thereby
increasing the total entropy of the universe. The tendency of the
universe to increase in entropy over time is described in the second
law of thermodynamics, making (D) correct. (A) and (B) are incorrect
because energy can never be created or destroyed, but only converted
into other
