 wire is 1.00-mm-diameter copper wire
and is suspended in air due to the two magnetic forces
from the bottom two wires. The current flow through the
two bottom wires is 75 A in each. Calculate the required
current flow in the suspended wire (M).

Problem 92.
1. How many magnetic force equations are there in
Chapter 20? List each one and explain when it applies. For
each magnetic force equation, show how the units work
out to give force in newtons.
2. An electron is moving north at a constant speed of
(a) In what direction should an electric field
point if the electron is to be accelerated to the east? (b) In
what direction should a magnetic field point if the electron
is to be accelerated to the west? (c) If the electric field of
part a has a strength of 
what magnetic field
(magnitude and direction) will produce zero net force on
the electron? (d) If the electron in part c is moving faster
than 
in which direction will it be accel-
erated? What if
