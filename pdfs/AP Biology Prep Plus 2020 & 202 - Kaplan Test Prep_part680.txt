 two basic kinds of mechanisms: sources of
variation (which increase genetic diversity) and selective pressures
(which decrease genetic diversity).
Sources of variation have already been discussed in multiple places
throughout this book. At the most foundational level, all heritable
variations ultimately arise from mutations (discussed in chapter 16),
direct changes to the genetic code, which impact the proteins produced
by an organism’s cells and, consequently, the phenotypes of that
organism. Genetic variation can also arise from other sources, such as the
shuﬀling of genes that occurs when sexual reproduction leads to a new
organism with a novel combination of parental genes. For instance,
immigration of new organisms into a population, followed by
interbreeding, can lead to an influx of new genes in a population.
If sources of variation acted alone, then species would just become more
and more diverse over time, but selective pressures serve to weed out
some phenotypes (and their a
