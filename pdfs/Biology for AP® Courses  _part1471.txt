eparate during meiosis II,
resulting in the formation of gametes containing
n+1 and n-1 chromosomes. This results in heart
and bleeding defects.
c.
Nondisjunction is the failure of homologous
chromosomes to separate during meiosis I or
failure of sister chromatids to separate during
meiosis II. This results in aneuploid gametes.
d.
Nondisjunction occurs when a pair of
homologous chromosomes fails to segregate
during meiosis II resulting in the formation of
gametes containing n+1, n-1, or n numbers of
chromosomes. This results in abnormal growth
patterns.
18. If the effects of Klinefelter syndrome are compared to
the effects of Down Syndrome, this disorder is ______.
a.
more severe than Down syndrome, due to gene
deletions in this syndrome
b.
more severe than Down syndrome, due to
trisomy in Klinefelter syndrome
c.
less severe than Down syndrome, due to
monosomy in Down Syndrome
d.
less severe than Down syndrome, due to X-
inactivation in this disorder
