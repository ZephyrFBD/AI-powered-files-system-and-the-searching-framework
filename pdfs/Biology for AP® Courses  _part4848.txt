lls of bivalves 2.
Chips of corals 3. The partial imprint of a trilobite 4. A
few vertebrae dated to 250 million years ago. The table of
extinction summarizes information on the five major
extinction events.
According to the table of extinction, which conclusion
about the fossils is most reasonable?
a.
The trilobites were the first animals to conquer
land.
b.
The rocks can be dated to the Cretaceous
Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary.
c.
The farmland was probably part of the seafloor
in the Permian period
d.

The average temperatures varied during the Pleistocene as
glaciation periods were followed by warm intervals. Using
the graph above and your existing knowledge, discuss
what happened to woolly mammoths and other cold-
adapted megafauna 10,000 years ago.
a.
Habitat destruction due to varying temperatures
and over-hunting by humans leading to their
extinction.
b.
Sudden increase in temperature and over-hunting
by humans leading to the
