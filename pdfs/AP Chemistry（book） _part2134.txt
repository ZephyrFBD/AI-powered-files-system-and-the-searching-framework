 benzene has zero dipole moment. (c) NaCl dissolves 
in water but not in benzene because the water–ion interac-
tions are stronger than benzene–ion interactions.
 13.15  Indicate the type of solute–solvent interaction (Section 11.2) 
 
that should be most important in each of the follow-
ing solutions: (a) CCl4 in benzene 1C6H62, (b) methanol 
1CH3OH2 in water, (c) KBr in water, (d) HCl in acetonitrile 
1CH3CN2.
 13.16  Indicate the principal type of solute–solvent interaction 
in each of the following solutions and rank the solutions 
from weakest to strongest solute–solvent interaction: 
 
(a) KCl in water, (b) CH2Cl2 in benzene 1C6H62, (c) metha-
nol 1CH3OH2 in water.
 13.17  An ionic compound has a very negative ∆Hsoln in water. 
 
(a) Would you expect it to be very soluble or nearly insol-
uble in water? (b) Which term would you expect to be the 
largest negative number: ∆Hsolvent, ∆Hsolute, or ∆Hmix?
 13.18  When ammonium chloride dissolves in water, the solution 
becomes colder.
