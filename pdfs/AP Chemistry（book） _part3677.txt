 how the two N and 
four O donor atoms coordinate to cobalt.
Give It Some Thought
Both H2O and ethylenediamine (en) have two nonbonding pairs of electrons. Why 
can en act as a bidentate ligand whereas water cannot?
In general, the complexes formed by chelating ligands (that is, bidentate and 
polydentate ligands) are more stable than the complexes formed by related monodentate 
ligands. The equilibrium formation constants for 3Ni(NH3)642+ and 3Ni(en)342+ illustrate 
this observation:
 
3Ni(H2O)642+(aq) + 6 NH3(aq) ∆ 3Ni(NH3)642+(aq) + 6 H2O(l)
 
 
 
 
 
 
Kf = 1.2 * 109 
 
[23.4]
 
3Ni(H2O)642+(aq) + 3 en(aq) ∆ 3Ni(en)342+(aq) + 6 H2O(l)
 
 
 
 
 
 
Kf = 6.8 * 1017  
[23.5]
Although the donor atom is nitrogen in both instances, 3Ni(en)342+ has a formation con-
stant that is more than 108 times larger than that of 3Ni(NH3)642+. This trend of generally 
larger formation constants for bidentate and polydentate ligands, known as the chelate 
effect, is examined in the “A Closer Look” essa
