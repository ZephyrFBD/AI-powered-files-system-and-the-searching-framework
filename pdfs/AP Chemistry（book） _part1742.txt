ter glass tube, or capillary, is placed in 
water, water rises in the tube. The rise of liquids up very narrow 
tubes is called capillary action. The adhesive forces between 
the liquid and the walls of the tube tend to increase the surface 
area of the liquid. The surface tension of the liquid tends to 
reduce the area, thereby pulling the liquid up the tube. The liquid 
climbs until the force of gravity on the liquid balances the adhe-
sive and cohesive forces.
Capillary action is widespread. For example, towels absorb 
liquid, and “stay-dry” synthetic fabrics move sweat away from 
the skin by capillary action. Capillary action also plays a role 
in moving water and dissolved nutrients upward through 
plants.
11.4 ∣ Phase Changes
Liquid water left uncovered in a glass eventually evaporates. An 
ice cube left in a warm room quickly melts. Solid CO2 (sold as a 
product called dry ice) sublimes at room temperature; that is, it 
changes directly from solid to gas. In general, each state
