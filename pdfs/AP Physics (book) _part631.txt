CHAPTER 6
Work and Energy
One of the great results of physics is that whenever energy is transferred or
transformed, it is found that no energy is gained or lost in the process.
This is the law of conservation of energy, one of the most important princi-
ples in physics; it can be stated as:
The total energy is neither increased nor decreased in any process. Energy
can be transformed from one form to another, and transferred from one
object to another, but the total amount remains constant.
We have already discussed the conservation of energy for mechanical systems
involving conservative forces, and we saw how it could be derived from Newton’s
laws and thus is equivalent to them. But in its full generality, the validity of the
law of conservation of energy, encompassing all forms of energy including those
associated with nonconservative forces like friction, rests on experimental obser-
vation. Even though Newton’s laws are found to fail in the sub
