nd are much simpler organisms than
humans or other multicellular animals. Therefore, the signaling cascades are also simpler and easier to
study, although they contain similar counterparts to human signaling. [2]
Based on the Evolution Connection, which of the following best describes the evolution of kinases?
a.
The tyrosine kinases evolved before yeast diverged from other eukaryotes, but the other fifty-five subfamilies
of kinases evolved after yeast diverged.
b.
Fifty-five subfamilies of kinases evolved before yeast diverged from other eukaryotes, but the tyrosine
kinases evolved after yeast diverged.
c.
All kinases evolved in yeast, but yeast later lost the tyrosine kinases because they do not need them.
d.
The evolution of tyrosine kinases involved in cellular communication occurred about 2.5 billion years ago.
