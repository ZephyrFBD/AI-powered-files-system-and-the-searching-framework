es’s, or 
Gay-Lussac’s law when either T, P, or V, respectively, is held constant.
Finally, we must incorporate the effect of the amount of gas present. For exam-
ple, when more air is forced into a balloon, the balloon gets bigger (Fig. 13–16).
Indeed, careful experiments show that at constant temperature and pressure, the
volume V of an enclosed gas increases in direct proportion to the mass m of gas
present. Hence we write
This proportion can be made into an equation by inserting a constant of propor-
tionality. Experiment shows that this constant has a different value for different
gases. However, the constant of proportionality turns out to be the same for all
gases if, instead of the mass m, we use the number of moles.
The “mole” is an official SI unit for the amount of substance. One mole
(abbreviated mol) is the amount of substance that contains
objects
(usually atoms, molecules, or ions, etc.). This number is called Avogadro’s number,
as discussed in Section 13–8. Its value co
