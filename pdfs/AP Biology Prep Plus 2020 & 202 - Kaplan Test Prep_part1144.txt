, here you see that only one aﬀected parent is
needed to produce oﬀspring with the mutation. Lastly, (D) is incorrect
because the pedigree shows three consecutive generations within the
same family that have aﬀected relatives at every generation. 
15. B
MFS is an autosomal dominant trait. Individual A, a 3rd generation child,
has MFS through an unaﬀected mom and an aﬀected dad. On that basis,
individual A must be heterozygous dominant. The probability of her
passing on the dominant allele is ½, and the probability of her passing on
the recessive allele is also ½. Having a child with an unaﬀected individual
means the probability of her partner passing on a recessive allele is 1/1.
Therefore, there is a (½)x(1/1.) = ½ or 1:2 chance the child will be born with
two recessive alleles and be unaﬀected. (B) is correct.
16. C
Women that are aﬀected by MFS are able to seek genetic counseling to
discuss the possibility of passing on the MFS mutation to their unborn
child. They are also able to s
