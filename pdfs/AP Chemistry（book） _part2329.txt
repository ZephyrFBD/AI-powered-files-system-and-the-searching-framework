 the overall en-
thalpy change for the reaction.
(b) Exothermic reactions are faster than endothermic 
reactions.
(c) If you double the temperature for a reaction, you cut 
the activation energy in half.
 14.59 Based on their activation energies and energy changes 
and assuming that all collision factors are the same, rank 
the following reactions from slowest to fastest.
(a) Ea = 45 kJ>mol; ∆E = -25 kJ>mol
(b) Ea = 35 kJ>mol; ∆E = -10 kJ>mol
(c) Ea = 55 kJ>mol; ∆E = 10 kJ>mol
 14.60 Which of the reactions in Exercise 14.59 will be fastest in 
the reverse direction? Which will be slowest?
 14.61 (a) A certain first-order reaction has a rate constant of 
2.75 * 10-2 s-1 at 20 °C. What is the value of k at 60 °C 
if Ea = 75.5 kJ>mol ? (b) Another first-order reaction also 
has a rate constant of 2.75 * 10-2 s-1 at 20 °C. What is 
the value of k at 60 °C if Ea = 125 kJ>mol ? (c) What as-
sumptions do you need to make in order to calculate an-
swers for parts (a) and (b)?
