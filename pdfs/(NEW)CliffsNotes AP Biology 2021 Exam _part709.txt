y CO2 and other gases. These gases,
called greenhouse gases, are transparent to visible and UV radiation, but absorb infrared radiation, reemitting it
again as infrared, which, subsequently, is trapped and reemitted again by more greenhouse gases. As a result, the
energy content of the atmosphere, and its temperature, increases. Because the glass enclosures of a greenhouse also
traps heat, the trapping of heat in the atmosphere by energy absorbing gases is called the greenhouse effect. As the
food and energy needs of the human population rise, forests are burned for agricultural land and fossil
fuels are burned for energy. Burning releases CO2, and more CO2 traps
more heat. As a result, global temperatures are rising. Warmer temperatures raise sea levels (by melting more ice),
decrease agriculture output (by affecting weather patterns), increase human disease (by broadening the range of
tropical disease vectors), and threaten extinction to species (by disrupting the environmental condi
