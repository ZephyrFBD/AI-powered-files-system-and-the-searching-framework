 (a) By plotting these data in a suitable fashion, determine 
whether the Clausius–Clapeyron equation (Equation 11.1) 
is obeyed. If it is obeyed, use your plot to determine ∆Hvap 
for C6F6. (b) Use these data to determine the boiling point 
of the compound.
 11.85  Suppose the vapor pressure of a substance is measured at two 
different temperatures. (a) By using the Clausius–Clapeyron 
equation (Equation 11.1) derive the following relationship 
between the vapor pressures, P
1 and P
