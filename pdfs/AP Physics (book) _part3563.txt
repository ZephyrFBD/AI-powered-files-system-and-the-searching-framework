atron accelerated protons

in 2011.
These large synchrotrons use a narrow ring of magnets (see Fig. 32–3) with
each magnet placed at the same radius from the center of the circle. The magnets
are interrupted by gaps where high voltage accelerates the particles to higher
speeds. Another way to describe the acceleration is to say the particles “surf” on
a traveling electromagnetic wave within radiofrequency (RF) cavities. (The par-
ticles are first given considerable energy in smaller accelerators, “injectors,”
before being injected into the large ring of the large synchrotron.)
One problem of any accelerator is that accelerating electric charges radiate
electromagnetic energy (see Chapter 22). Since ions or electrons are accelerated
in an accelerator, we can expect considerable energy to be lost by radiation.
The effect increases with energy and is especially important in circular machines
where centripetal acceleration is present, such as sy
