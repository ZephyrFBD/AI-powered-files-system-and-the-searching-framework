of bonded atoms. Such orbitals, designated as s* or p*, are less stable 
(of higher energy) than bonding molecular orbitals. (Section 9.7)
antiferromagnetism A form of magnetism in which unpaired 
electron spins on adjacent sites point in opposite directions and 
cancel each other’s effects. (Section 23.1)
aqueous solution A solution in which water is the solvent. 
(Chapter 4: Introduction)
aromatic hydrocarbons Hydrocarbon compounds that contain 
a planar, cyclic arrangement of carbon atoms linked by both s 
and delocalized p bonds. (Section 24.2)
Arrhenius equation An equation that relates the rate constant 
for a reaction to the frequency factor, A, the activation energy, 
Ea, and the temperature, T: k = Ae-Ea>RT. In its logarithmic form it is 
written ln k = -Ea>RT + ln A. (Section 14.5)
atmosphere (atm) A unit of pressure equal to 760 torr; 
1 atm = 101.325 kPa. (Section 10.2)
atom The smallest representative particle of an element. The 
almost infinitesimally small building block
