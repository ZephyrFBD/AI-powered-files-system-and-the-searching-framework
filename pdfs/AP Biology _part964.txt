“II” on the model. Finally, the last relay
molecule enters the nucleus and initiates a response that is
carried out when a gene is transcribed. In the model shown, the
ligand is probably a polypeptide or protein because it cannot
dissolve through the cell membrane, which consists of a lipid
bilayer. Only lipid signaling molecules have the characteristics
to do that. If the ligand were a lipid, it could dissolve directly
through the cell membrane and bind with a receptor inside the
cell in the cytoplasm.
The response to the signal in the cytoplasm (at the area labeled
“II” on the model) is like dominoes falling one after the other.
Each domino knocks over the next one in line to fall. Similarly,
the ligand triggers a transducer, which triggers another
transducer (and so on and so on) until there is a final response.
