the gas will occupy a much larger volume at 85 km than at 50 km. 
(c) We expect gases to behave most ideally in the thermosphere, 
around the stratopause and in the troposphere at low altitude. 
18.3 (a) A = troposphere, 0–10 km; B = stratosphere, 12–50 km; 
C = mesosphere, 50–85 km (b) Ozone is a pollutant in the tropo-
sphere and ﬁlters UV radiation in the stratosphere. (c) The tropo-
sphere (d) Only region C in the diagram is involved in an aurora 
borealis, assuming a narrow “boundary” between the stratosphere 
and mesosphere at 50 km. (e) The concentration of water vapor is 
greatest near Earth’s surface in region A and decreases with altitude. 
Water’s single bonds are susceptible to photodissociation in regions B 
and C, so its concentration is likely to be very low in these regions. The 
relative concentration of CO2, with strong double bonds, increases in 
regions B and C, because it is less susceptible to photodissociation.
