m air temperature is 
The speed of sound 
as a function of temperature can be approximated by
where T is in °C.
*60. (III) A longitudinal earthquake wave strikes a boundary
between two types of rock at a 38° angle. As the wave
crosses the boundary, the specific gravity changes from 3.6
to 2.5. Assuming that the elastic modulus is the same for
both types of rock, determine the angle of refraction.

same size as a 0.75-m-wide window? (The speed of sound
is 
at 20°C.) What frequencies would diffract
through the window?

62. A 62-kg person jumps from a window to a fire net 20.0 m
directly below, which stretches the net 1.4 m. Assume that
the net behaves like a simple spring. (a) Calculate how much it
would stretch if the same person were lying in it. (b) How
much would it stretch if the person jumped from 3
