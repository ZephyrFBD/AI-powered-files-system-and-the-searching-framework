Other 
substances follow graphs similar to Fig. 14–5, although the melting-point and
boiling-point temperatures are different, as are the specific heats and heats of
fusion and vaporization. Values for the heats of fusion and vaporization, which
are also called the latent heats, are given in Table 14–3 for a number of substances.

Making ice. How much energy does a freezer have to
remove from 1.5 kg of water at 20°C to make ice at 
APPROACH We need to calculate the total energy removed by adding the heat
outflow (1) to reduce the water temperature from 20°C to 0°C, (2) to change
the liquid water to solid ice at 0°C, and (3) to lower the ice temperature from
0°C to 
SOLUTION The heat Q that needs to be removed from the 1.5 kg of water is
= 6.6 * 105 J = 660 kJ.
