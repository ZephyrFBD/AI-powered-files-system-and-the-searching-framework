subunit is exchanged for GTP. The
β and γ subunits dissociate from the α subunit, and a cellular response is triggered either by the α subunit or the
dissociated βγ pair. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP terminates the signal.

G-protein-linked receptors have been extensively studied and much has been learned about their roles in maintaining health.
Bacteria that are pathogenic to humans can release poisons that interrupt specific G-protein-linked receptor function, leading
to illnesses such as pertussis, botulism, and cholera. In cholera (Figure 9.7), for example, the water-borne bacterium Vibrio
cholerae produces a toxin, choleragen, that binds to cells lining the small intestine. The toxin then enters these intestinal
cells, where it modifies a G-protein that controls the opening of a chloride channel and causes it to remain continuously
active, resulting in large losses of flui
