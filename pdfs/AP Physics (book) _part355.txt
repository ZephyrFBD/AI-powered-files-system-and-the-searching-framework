tter how hard I pull, the backward reaction force always equals
my forward force, so the net force must be zero. I’ll never be able to move this
load.” Is he correct?
RESPONSE No. Although it is true that the action and reaction forces are equal
in magnitude, the assistant has forgotten that they are exerted on different
objects. The forward (“action”) force is exerted by the assistant on the sled 
(Fig. 4–12), whereas the backward “reaction” force is exerted by the sled on the
assistant. To determine if the assistant moves or not, we must consider only 
the forces on the assistant and then apply  
where 
is the net force
on the assistant,
is the acceleration of the assistant, and m is the assistant’s mass.
There are two forces on the assistant that affect his forward motion; they are
shown as bright red (magenta) arrows in Figs.4–12 and 4–13: they are (1) the hori-
zontal force 
exerted on the assistant by the ground (the harder he pushes
backward against the ground, the harder the gr
