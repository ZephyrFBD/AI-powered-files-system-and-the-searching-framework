me molecular formula but different arrangements of  
atoms 
are called isomers. For example, 1-propanol and 2-propanol are structural isomers, com-
pounds that have the same molecular formula but different structural formulas. There 
are many different kinds of isomers, as we will discover later in this book.

Much of the richness of organic chemistry is possible because organic compounds 
can form long chains of carbon–carbon bonds. The series of alkanes that begins with 
methane, ethane, and propane and the series of alcohols that begins with methanol, 
ethanol, and propanol can both be extended for as long as we desire, in principle. The 
Give It Some Thought 
Draw the structural formulas of the two isomers of butane, C4H10.
As already noted, many different functional groups can replace one or more of the 
hydrogens on an alkane—for example, one or m
