nsufficient
for cellular respiration. For energy, muscle fibers will switch from aerobic
respiration to anaerobic respiration, which produces lactic acid. Buildup of lactic
acid triggers a cramp during exercise.
(c) The reaction of phosphocreatine + ADP to ATP + creatine is reversible, and
during periods of rest the store of phosphocreatine is regenerated. Explain
how cellular respiration returns muscles to normal aȇer exercise. (1 point)
Explanation (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Since during periods of rest after exercise cells do not require as much ATP,
excess ATP produced via cellular respiration is used to replenish stores of ATP
and phosphocreatine in muscle fibers.
During periods of rest, cellular respiration uses excess ATP to replenish stores of ATP and
phosphocreatine in muscle fibers
