ome is composed of a single, double-stranded DNA molecule in the form of a loop or circle (Figure
10.2). The region in the cell containing this genetic material is called a nucleoid. Some prokaryotes also have smaller loops
of DNA called plasmids that are not essential for normal growth. Bacteria can exchange these plasmids with other bacteria,
sometimes receiving beneficial new genes that the recipient can add to their chromosomal DNA. Antibiotic resistance is
one trait that often spreads through a bacterial colony through plasmid exchange.

Figure 10.2 Prokaryotes, including bacteria and archaea, have a single, circular chromosome located in a central
region called the nucleoid.
In eukaryotes, the genome consists of several double-stranded linear DNA molecules (Figure 10.3). Each species of
eukaryotes has a characteristic number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells.
