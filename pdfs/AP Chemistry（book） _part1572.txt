he pressure 
of the gas, (2) the number of moles of gas in the cylinder, and  
(3) the average distance between molecules.
Plan We can use the gas laws to evaluate the changes in pressure. 
The number of moles of gas in the cylinder will not change unless 
gas is either added or removed. Assessing the average distance 
between molecules is not quite as straightforward. For a given 
number of gas molecules, the average distance between mole-
cules increases as the volume increases. Conversely, for constant 
volume, the average distance between molecules decreases as the 
number of moles increases. Thus, the average distance between 
molecules will be proportional to V/n.

(a)  
Because it is stipulated that the pressure remains constant, pres-
sure is not a variable in this problem, and the total number of 
moles of gas will also remain constant. We know from Charlesâ€™s 
law, however, that heating the gas while maintaining constant 
pressure will cause the piston to move and the vol
