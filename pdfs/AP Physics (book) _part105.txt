needs about 80 piano tuners. This is, of course, only a rough estimate.† It tells 
us that there must be many more than 10 piano tuners, and surely not as many
as 1000.
A Harder Example—But Powerful
Estimating the radius of Earth. Believe it or
not, you can estimate the radius of the Earth without having to go into space
(see the photograph on page 1). If you have ever been on the shore of a large
lake, you may have noticed that you cannot see the beaches, piers, or rocks at
water level across the lake on the opposite shore. The lake seems to bulge out
between you and the opposite shore—a good clue that the Earth is round.
Suppose you climb a stepladder and discover that when your eyes are 10 ft (3.0 m)
above the water, you can just see the rocks at water level on the oppos
