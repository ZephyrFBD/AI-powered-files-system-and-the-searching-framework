 increased, is a
force required to do so? Is the potential difference changed?
What happens to the work done in the pulling process?
13. If the electric field 
is uniform in a region, what can you
infer about the electric potential V? If V is uniform in a
region of space, what can you infer about 
14. Is the electric potential energy of two isolated unlike charges
positive or negative?What about two like charges?What is the
significance of the sign of the potential energy in each case?
15. If the voltage across a fixed capacitor is doubled, the amount 
of energy it stores (a) doubles; (b) is halved; (c) is quadrupled;
(d) is unaffected; (e) none of these. Explain.
16. How does the energy stored in a capacitor change when a
dielectric is inserted if (a) the capacitor is isolated so Q
does not change; (b) the capacitor remains connected to 
a battery so V does not change? Explain.
17. A dielectric is pulled out from between the plates of a
capacitor which remains connected to a battery.
