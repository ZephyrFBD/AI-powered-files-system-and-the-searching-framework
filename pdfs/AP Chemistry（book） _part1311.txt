Notice that the reaction is exothermic.  
Nevertheless, energy is needed from sunlight or  
another source for the reaction to begin, as is the 
case for the combustion of H21g2 and O21g2 to form  
H2O1g2.

CHEMICAL BONDS, LEWIS SYMBOLS, AND THE OCTET RULE 
 
(INTRODUCTION AND SECTION 8.1) In this chapter, we have 
focused on the interactions that lead to the formation of chem-
ical bonds. We classify these bonds into three broad groups: ionic 
bonds, which result from the electrostatic forces that exist be-
tween ions of opposite charge; covalent bonds, which result from 
the sharing of electrons by two atoms; and metallic bonds, which 
result from a delocalized sharing of electrons in metals. The 
 
formation of bonds involves interactions of the outermost elec-
trons of atoms, their valence electrons. The valen
