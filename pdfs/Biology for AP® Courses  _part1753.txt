ed to as the coding region. The five coding regions for the tryptophan
biosynthesis enzymes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon. Just before the coding region is the
transcriptional start site. This is the region of DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription. The promoter
sequence is upstream of the transcriptional start site; each operon has a sequence within or near the promoter to which
proteins (activators or repressors) can bind and regulate transcription.
A DNA sequence called the operator sequence is encoded between the promoter region and the first trp coding gene.
This operator contains the DNA code to which the repressor protein can bind. When tryptophan is present in the cell,
two tryptophan molecules bind to the trp repressor, which changes shape to bind to the trp operator. Binding of the
tryptophanâ€“repressor complex at the operator physically prevents the RNA polymerase from binding, and transcribing the
downstream genes.
When trypto
