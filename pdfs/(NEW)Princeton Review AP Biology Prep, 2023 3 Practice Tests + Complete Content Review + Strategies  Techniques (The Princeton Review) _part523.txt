, they have both a positive and a negative charge. Free amino acids are not
found in the membrane.

C
Glucose is C6H12O6, and three of them are equal to C18H36O18, as in (A), but the dehydration reactions to
produce two glycosidic bonds between the three monosaccharides would remove two H2O molecules, or four
hydrogens and two oxygens. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).
7.
B
The hypothesis that life may have arisen from formation of complex molecules from the primordial “soup” of
Earth is not supported by the absence of nucleic acids. All life is DNA-based, yet no nucleic acid molecules
were detected. The presence of carbon molecules, amino acids, and sugars, which are common compounds and
compose life, supports the hypothesis, so eliminate (A), (C), and (D). Choice (B) is correct.
8.
C
The amino acids cysteine and methionine contain the element sulfur (as indicated by the S in the amino acid
structure shown). However, no sulfur-based compounds were included in the Miller-Urey exp
