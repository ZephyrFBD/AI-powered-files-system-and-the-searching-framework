FIGURE 15–14 The Carnot cycle. Heat engines work in 
a cycle, and the cycle for the theoretical Carnot engine 
begins at point “a” on this PV diagram for an ideal gas.
(1) The gas is first expanded isothermally, with the addition
of heat 
along the path “ab” at temperature 
(2) Next the gas expands adiabatically from “b” to “c”—
no heat is exchanged, but the temperature drops to 
(3) The gas is then compressed at constant temperature 
path cd, and heat 
flows out. (4) Finally, the gas is 
compressed adiabatically, path da, back to its original state.

Steam engine efficiency. A steam engine operates
between 500°C and 270°C. What is the maximum possible efficiency of this
engine?
APPROACH The maximum possible efficiency is the idealized Carnot efficiency,
Eq. 15–5. We must use kelvin temperatures.
SOLUTION We first change the temp
