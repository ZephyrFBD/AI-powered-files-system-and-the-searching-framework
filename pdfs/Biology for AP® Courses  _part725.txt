 need to know how the target acts inside the cell and which reactions go awry in
the case of disease. Once the target and the pathway are identified, then the actual process of drug design
begins. During this stage, chemists and biologists work together to design and synthesize molecules that
can either block or activate a particular reaction. However, this is only the beginning: both if and when a drug
prototype is successful in performing its function, then it must undergo many tests from in vitro experiments
to clinical trials before it can get FDA approval to be on the market.
