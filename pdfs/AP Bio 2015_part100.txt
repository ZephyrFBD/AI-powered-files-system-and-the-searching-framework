1. To determine the likelihood that a patient with a bacterial infection who is in the intensive care unit (ICU)
of a hospital could be successfully treated with antibiotic therapies, researchers investigated the frequency of 
antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from patients in ICUs in the United States from 1994 to 2000. The data 
from the study are shown in the table, along with the overall change in the frequency of bacterial resistance in 
patient samples from 1994 to 2000.
