liquid benzene? (c) Determine the fuel value, in 
kJ>g, for acetylene and benzene.
 5.113 Ammonia 1NH32 boils at -33 °C; at this temperature it has a 
density of 0.81 g>cm3. The enthalpy of formation of NH31g2 
is -46.2 kJ>mol, and the enthalpy of vaporization of NH31l2 
is 23.2 kJ>mol. Calculate the enthalpy change when 1 L of 
liquid NH3 is burned in air to give N21g2 and H2O1g2. How 
does this compare with ∆H for the complete combustion of 
1 L of liquid methanol, CH3OH1l2? For CH3OH1l2, the den-
sity at 25 °C is 0.792 g>cm3, and ∆Hf° = -239 kJ>mol.
 5.103 Limestone stalactites and stalagmites are formed in caves by 
the following reaction:
Ca2 +1aq2 + 2 HCO3
-1aq2 ¡ CaCO31s2 + CO21g2 + H2O1l2
 
 If 1 mol of CaCO3 forms at 298 K under 1 atm pressure, the 
 
reaction performs 2.47 kJ of P–V work, pushing back the atmo-
sphere as the gaseous CO2 forms. At the same time, 38.95 kJ 
 
of heat is absorbed from the environment. What are the 
 
values of ∆H and of ∆E for this reaction?
