 proton was created. Therefore, beta emission is 
equivalent to the conversion of a neutron (1
0n or simply n) to a proton (1
1H or simply p):

Just because an electron is emitted from a nucleus in beta decay, we should not think that 
the nucleus is composed of these particles any more than we consider a match to be com-
posed of sparks simply because it gives them off when struck. The beta-particle electron 
comes into being only when the nucleus undergoes a nuclear reaction. Furthermore, the 
speed of the beta particle is sufficiently high that it does not end up in an orbital of the 
decaying atom.
Gamma Radiation Gamma 1G2 radiation (or gamma rays) consists of high-energy 
photons (that is, electromagnetic radiation of very short wavelength). It changes neither 
the atomic number nor the mass number of a nucleus and is represented as either 0
0g or 
simply g. Gamma radiation usually accompanies other radioactive emission because it
