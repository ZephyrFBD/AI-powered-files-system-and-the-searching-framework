l compound NaCl2, where the sodium ion has a 2+ 
charge (the second ionization energy for sodium is given in 
Table 7.2). (a) How large would the lattice energy need to be 
for the formation of NaCl2 to be exothermic? (b) If we were 
to estimate the lattice energy of NaCl2 to be roughly equal 
to that of MgCl2 (2326 kJ>mol from Table 8.1), what value 
would you obtain for the standard enthalpy of formation, 
∆Hf°, of NaCl2?
 8.84 A classmate of yours is convinced that he knows everything 
about electronegativity. (a) In the case of atoms X and Y hav-
ing different electronegativities, he says, the diatomic mole-
cule X¬Y must be polar. Is your classmate correct? (b) Your 
classmate says that the farther the two atoms are apart in a 
bond, the larger the dipole moment will be. Is your classmate 
correct?
