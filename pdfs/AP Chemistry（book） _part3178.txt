n, as in the present example. Over the course of the reaction, the Zn electrode 
gradually disappears and the copper electrode gains mass. More typically, the electrodes 
are made of a conducting material, such as platinum or graphite, that does not gain or lose 
mass during the reaction but serves as a surface at which electrons are transferred.
Each compartment of a voltaic cell is called a half-cell. One half-cell is the site of the 
oxidation half-reaction, and the other is the site of the reduction half-reaction. In our 
present example, Zn is oxidized and Cu2+ is reduced:
Anode 1oxidation half@reaction2  
Zn1s2 ยก Zn2+1aq2 + 2 e-
Cathode 1reduction half@reaction2  
Cu2+1aq2 + 2 e- ยก Cu1s2
Electrons become available as zinc metal is oxidized at the anode. They flow through 
the external circuit to the cathode, where they are consumed as Cu2+1aq2 is reduced. 
Because Zn(s) is oxidized in the cell, the zinc electrode loses mass, and the concentration of 
the Zn2+1aq2 solution increas
