the cell were very large
or thick, diffusion would not be able to provide oxygen quickly enough to the inside of the cell. Therefore, dependence
on diffusion as a means of obtaining oxygen and removing carbon dioxide remains feasible only for small organisms or
those with highly-flattened bodies, such as many flatworms (Platyhelminthes). Larger organisms had to evolve specialized
respiratory tissues, such as gills, lungs, and respiratory passages accompanied by complex circulatory systems, to transport
oxygen throughout their entire body.
Figure 30.2 The cell of the unicellular algae Ventricaria ventricosa is one of the largest known, reaching one to five
centimeters in diameter. Like all single-celled organisms, V. ventricosa exchanges gases across the cell membrane.
Direct Diffusion
For small multicellular organisms, diffusion across the outer membrane is sufficient to meet their oxygen needs. Gas
exchange by direct diffusion across surface membranes is efficient for organisms less t
