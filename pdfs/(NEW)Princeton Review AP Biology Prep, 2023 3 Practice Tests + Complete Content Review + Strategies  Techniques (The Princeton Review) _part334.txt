mplished by an enzyme called helicase. The exposed DNA strands now
form a y-shaped replication fork.
Now each strand can serve as a template for the synthesis of another strand. DNA replication begins at specific sites
called origins of replication. Because the DNA helix twists and rotates during DNA replication, another class of
enzymes, called DNA topoisomerases, cuts, and rejoins the helix to prevent tangling. The enzyme that performs the
actual addition of nucleotides to the freshly built strand is DNA polymerase. But DNA polymerase, oddly enough,
can add nucleotides only to the 3â€² end of an existing strand. Therefore, to start off replication, an enzyme called
RNA primase adds a short strand of RNA nucleotides called an RNA primer. After replication, the primer is
degraded by enzymes and replaced with DNA so that the final strand contains only DNA.
Neither DNA strand is directly copied; however, by building a new partner
strand for each of them, a two-stranded molecule is created
