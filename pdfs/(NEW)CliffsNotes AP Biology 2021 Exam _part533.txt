ring pathogen must first be engulfed by a macrophage.
T cells then bind to the macrophage in a cell-mediated response. Interleukins secreted by the helper T cells stimulate
the production of B cells.
Humans have learned to supplement natural body defenses. Three important approaches follow:
 
1. Antibiotics are chemicals derived from bacteria or fungi that are harmful to other microorganisms.
2. Vaccines are substances that stimulate the production of memory cells. Inactivated viruses or fragments of
viruses, bacteria, or other microorganisms are used as vaccines. Once memory cells are formed, the introduction of
the live microorganism will stimulate a swift response by the immune system before any disease can become
established.
3. Passive immunity is obtained by transferring antibodies from an individual who previously had a disease to a
newly infected individual. Newborn infants are protected by passive immunity through the transfer of antibodies
across the placenta and by antibodie
