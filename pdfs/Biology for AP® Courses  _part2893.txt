 heat at a faster rate than larger
organisms because they have a smaller surface
area for their mass.
40. If an American alligator has been basking but gets too
hot, how might the alligator cool itself?
a.
increase vasodilation
b.
sweat
c.
move into shade
d.
increase metabolic rate
41.
During torpor, arctic ground squirrels reduce their energy
requirements by reducing their core body temperature and
metabolic rate. Why would an active ground squirrel’s
ATP synthesis also increase in proportion to metabolic rate
when temperatures fall below 0°?
a.
Colder temperatures causes ATP to degrade.
b.
ATP is synthesized through cellular respiration,
which provides body heat.
c.
ATP synthesis is needed to provide more oxygen
to the cells.
d.
ATP is consumed by the cells to generate body
heat.
