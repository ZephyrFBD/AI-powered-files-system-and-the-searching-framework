 My mother says,Go down the hall and tell Freddie you’re sorry. 
 
 But Dad says, Do you want to tell Freddie you’re sorry? 
 
 I don’t. 
 
 My parents look at one another. Dad says, Freddie is a good boy.He 
 
 was only pushing your little brother on the swing. Isn’t that right? 
 
 He was trying to steal my Cuchulain story. 
 
 Och, now. Freddie doesn’t care about the Cuchulain story. He has 
 
 his own story. Hundreds of stories. He’s Jewish. 
 
 What’s Jewish? 
 
 Dad laughs. Jewish is, Jewish is people with their own stories.They 
 
 don’t need Cuchulain.They have Moses.They have Samson. 
 
 What’s Samson? 
 
 If you go down and talk to Freddie I’ll tell you about Samson later. 
 
 You can tell Freddie you’re sorry and you’ll never do it again and you 
 
 can even ask him about Samson.Anything you like as long as you talk 
 
 to Freddie.Will you?
