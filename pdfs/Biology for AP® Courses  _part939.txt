 (lycopene), the yellow of corn seeds (zeaxanthin), or the orange of an orange peel (β-carotene)—are used
as advertisements to attract seed dispersers. In photosynthesis, carotenoids function as photosynthetic pigments that are
very efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy. When a leaf is exposed to full sun, the light-dependent reactions
are required to process an enormous amount of energy; if that energy is not handled properly, it can do significant damage.
Therefore, many carotenoids reside in the thylakoid membrane, absorb excess energy, and safely dissipate that energy as
heat.
Each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light, which is the
absorption spectrum. The graph in Figure 8.13 shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and a type
of carotenoid pigment called β-carotene (which absorbs blue and green light). Notice how each pigment has a distinct set
of peaks and troughs, revealing a
