n 3, the one we want, is 
the sum of the ∆G° values for reactions 1 and 2:
We can convert this to E ° from the relation-
ship ∆G° = -nFE °:
 1.17 * 105 J>mol = -122196,485 C>mol2E °
 E ° =
1.17 * 105 J>mol
-122196,485 C>mol2 = -0.606 J>C = -0.606 V
(c) The standard reduction potential for 
FeF21-0.606 V2 is more negative than that 
for Fe2+1-0.440 V2, telling us that the re-
duction of FeF2 is the less favorable process. 
When FeF2 is reduced, we not only reduce 
the Fe2+ but also break up the ionic solid. 
Because this additional energy must be over-
come, the reduction of FeF2 is less favorable 
than the reduction of Fe2+.
Chapter Summary and Key terms
OXIDATION STATES AND OXIDATION–REDUCTION REACTIONS 
(INTRODUCTION AND SECTION 20.1) In this chapter, we have 
focused on electrochemistry, the branch of chemistry that relates elec-
tricity and chemical reactions. Electrochemistry involves oxidation– 
reduction reactions, also called redox reactions. These reactions 
involve a change i
