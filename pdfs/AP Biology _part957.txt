n that was soaked with KOH into the bottom of
all three respirometers to bind with the CO2 that is released
during cellular respiration. CO2 combines with KOH to form a
precipitate that will prevent the CO2 from interfering with the
results.) Finally, I submerged the three respirometers
completely into a bucket of water that was 0°C, keeping them
upright.
Treatment Group 2: I set up another three respirometers
(exactly like the ones used in Treatment Group 1), but I placed

them in a water bath that was 25°C, keeping them upright.
Finally, for both treatment groups, I allowed 15 minutes for the
respirometer tubes to equilibrate with the water temperature.
Since the respirometers were filled with air, the water entered
the pipette but did not completely fill it. I then observed and
recorded the level of water in each pipette at time zero. I made
observations and took measurements every 10 minutes for 60
minutes. As the peas respire
