the 
sequence of bases that appear to align with your gene of interest. 
If you click on the link titled “Distance tree of results,” you will see a cladogram with 
the species with similar sequences to your gene of interest placed on the cladogram 
according to how closely their matched gene aligns with your gene of interest. 
■ Analyzing Results 
Recall that species with common ancestry will share similar genes. The more similar 
genes two species have in common, the more recent their common ancestor and the 
closer the two species will be located on a cladogram. 
As you collect information from BLAST for each of the gene files, you should be 
thinking about your original hypothesis and whether the data support or cause you to 
reject your original placement of the fossil species on the cladogram. 
For each BLAST query, consider the following: 
•  The higher the score, the closer the alignment. 
•  The lower the e value, the closer the alignment. 
•  Sequences with e values less than
