 complexes of chelating agents. A related group of plant 
pigments known as chlorophylls are important in photosynthesis, the 
process by which plants use solar energy to convert CO2 and H2O 
into carbohydrates.
NOMENCLATURE AND ISOMERISM IN COORDINATION CHEM-
ISTRY (SECTION 23.4) In naming coordination compounds, the 
number and type of ligands attached to the metal ion are specified, 
as is the oxidation state of the metal ion. Isomers are compounds 
with the same composition but different arrangements of atoms and 
therefore different properties. Structural isomers differ in the bond-
ing arrangements of the ligands. Linkage isomerism occurs when a 
ligand can coordinate to a metal ion through different donor atoms. 
 
Coordination-sphere isomers contain different ligands in the 
coordination sphere. Stereoisomers are isomers with the same chem-
ical bonding arrangements but different spatial arrangements of 
ligands. The most common forms of stereoisomerism are geometric 
isomerism
