using appropriate enthalpy 
changes for related reactions. To do so, we 
apply Hess’s law.
 
5.7  ▶ Enthalpies of Formation  
Establish standard values for enthalpy 
changes in chemical reactions and use them 
to calculate enthalpy changes for reactions.
 
5.8  ▶ Bond Enthalpies Use average bond 
enthalpies to estimate gas-phase reaction 
enthalpies.
 
5.9  ▶ Foods and Fuels Examine foods and 
fuels as sources of energy and discuss some 
related health and social issues.
WHaT’s aHEad
Everything we do is connected  
in one way or another with energy. Without 
energy modern society could not function and 
life itself would not exist. The issues surrounding 
energy—its sources, production, distribution, 
consumption, and environmental impact—
pervade conversations in science, politics, 
economics, and public policy.
With the exception of the energy from the Sun, most of the energy used 
in our daily lives comes from chemical reactions. The combustion of 
gasoline, the production of electr
