5. In pea plants, the tall (T) allele is dominant to the dwarf (t) allele. Two heterozygous (Tt) pea plants are crossed
and produce 400 offspring. Three hundred offspring are expected to be tall, and 100 are expected to be short.
There are 290 tall offspring observed and 110 dwarf offspring observed. Calculate the chi-square value from
this data (using a p-value of 0.05), and state whether there is likely a statistically significant difference between
the observed and expected data.
(A) The chi-square value is 0.67. There is a statistically significant difference between the observed and
expected data.
(B) The chi-square value is 0.67. There is NOT a statistically significant difference between the observed and
expected data.
(C) The chi-square value is 1.33. There is a statistically significant difference between the observed and
expected data.
(D) The chi-square value is 1.33. There is NOT a statistically significant difference between the observed an
