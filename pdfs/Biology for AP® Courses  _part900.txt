phosphorylation.
b.
The citric acid produces pyruvate, which
converts to glucose to enter glycolysis. This
pathway produces NADH and FADH2 , which
enter oxidative phosphorylation to produce
ATP through chemiosmosis.
c.
Citric acid produces NADH and FADH2 ,
which undergo oxidative phosphorylation. This
produces ATP by pumping protons through
chemiosmosis. The ATP produced is utilized in
large amount in the process of glycolysis.
d.
Glycolysis produces pyruvate, which directly
enters the citric acid cycle. This cycle produces
the energy currency that undergoes the electron
transport chain to produce water and ATP.
SCIENCE PRACTICE CHALLENGE QUESTIONS
53. Combustion of carbohydrates, like in a fireplace, is a
reduction-oxidation reaction in which the carbon atom is
oxidized and the oxygen atom is reduced, producing water
and carbon dioxide. Oxidative phosphorylation and
glycolysis are also reduction-oxidation reactions that
produce the same products. Explain the differences and
