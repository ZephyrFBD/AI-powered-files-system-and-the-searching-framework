of genes that
have been implicated in this disorder have led researchers
to refer to the characteristics as autisms described by a
spectrum of disorders, ASD. One of the gene implicated is
bola2. While humans and other primates have genomes
that are reported to have only a 2% deviation the particular
form of bola2 that occurs in 99% of human genomes that
have been mapped does not occur in other primates. And
bola2 is not present in the Neanderthal genome. Even
more interesting is that single nucleotide variations in
human bola2 are significantly less frequent than genes

schizophrenia.
C. Evaluate the selection pressure and direction (positive
or negative) indicated by this observation.
D. Several hundred genes have been implicated in ASD
and many others probably will eventually be discovered.
Expression in a gene networks can depend on factors that
are both genetic and environmental. Given the complexity
