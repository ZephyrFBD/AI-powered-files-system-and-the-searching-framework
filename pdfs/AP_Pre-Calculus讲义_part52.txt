f $1000 is invested at an interest rate of 12% per year. Find the amounts in the 
account after 3 years if interest is compounded annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, 
and daily.

2.3.1 The Number e 
The number e is defined as the value that (1+1/n)n approaches as n becomes large. 
 
It appears that, rounded to five decimal places, e ≈ 2.71828; in fact, the approximate value 
to 20 decimal places is 
e ≈ 2.71828182845904523536 
It can be shown that e is an irrational number, so we cannot write its exact value in 
decimal form. 
 
2.3.2 The Natural Exponential Function 
The natural exponential function is the exponential function

with base e. It is often referred to as the exponential function. 
Since 2 < e < 3, the graph of the natural exponential function lies between the graphs of 
y=2x and y=3x, as shown below.
