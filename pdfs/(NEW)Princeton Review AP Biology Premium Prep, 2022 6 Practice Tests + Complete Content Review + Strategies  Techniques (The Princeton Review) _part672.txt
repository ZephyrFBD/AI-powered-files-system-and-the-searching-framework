Questions 17â€“19 refer to the following passage.
The extracellular environment of the human body is typically abundant in sodium and calcium. In skeletal
muscle cells, the sarcoplasmic reticulum is a specialized organelle that actively sequesters calcium from the cytosol.
It stockpiles the calcium until a motor neuron triggers its release through an action potential, which opens voltage-
gated calcium channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The calcium is necessary for the calcium-mediated
functions of the protein troponin. In the presence of calcium, troponin removes tropomyosin from the myosin
binding sites on actin filaments. This attachment is essential for sarcomere and muscle contraction.
17. Which of the following statements best describes the uptake of calcium by skeletal muscles and the
sarcoplasmic reticulu
