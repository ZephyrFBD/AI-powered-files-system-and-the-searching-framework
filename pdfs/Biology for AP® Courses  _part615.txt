he fatty acid tails (some kinked by double bonds), the presence of
cholesterol embedded in the membrane, and the mosaic nature of the proteins and protein-carbohydrate combinations,
which are not firmly fixed in place. Plasma membranes enclose and define the borders of cells, but rather than being a
static bag, they are dynamic and constantly in flux.
5.2 Passive Transport
The passive forms of transport, diffusion and osmosis, move materials of small molecular weight across membranes.
Substances diffuse from areas of high concentration to areas of lower concentration, and this process continues until the
substance is evenly distributed in a system. In solutions containing more than one substance, each type of molecule
diffuses according to its own concentration gradient, independent of the diffusion of other substances. Many factors can
affect the rate of diffusion, including concentration gradient, size of the particles that are diffusing, temperature of the
system, and so on.
