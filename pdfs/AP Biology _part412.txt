position, rotating around the upright line. (EVO-3)
(D) Begin with the species with no traits: that is Species C. It must be
placed on a line separated from the others. It is an “outgroup.” Then,
notice that all the other Species (A, B, and D) have Trait 1. Thus,
Trait 1 must appear below all of them on the cladogram. Next,
notice that only Species A and B have Trait 2. Thus, they must be off
on a line and above Trait 2. Then, you’ll see that only Species B has
Trait 3, so it must be diverted off on a line above Trait 3. Finally,
Species D has Trait 4 and Trait 5, but no other species has those
traits. Thus, Species D must be above Trait 1 (because it has that
trait), below Trait 2 a
