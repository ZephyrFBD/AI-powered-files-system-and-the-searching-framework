The surface area of a sphere is proportional to the square of its radius, as shown in the following formula:
Dividing the surface area of a sphere formula by the volume of a sphere formula gives you the surface area to
volume ratio:
Note that since r (the radius) is in the denominator, as the radius increases, the surface area to volume ratio will
decrease. All materials that are exchanged between a cell and its environment must pass through the surface area of
the cell. As the radius of a cell increases, the amount of surface area available per unit volume for exchange of
materials gets smaller and smaller. Eventually, this will limit the cell’s ability to efficiently exchange materials with
its environment and ultimately impact how big the cell can grow. Larger cells have a lower surface area to volume
ratio and a less efficient exchange of materials with the cell’s environment. For this reason, it can be advantageous
for an organism to be
