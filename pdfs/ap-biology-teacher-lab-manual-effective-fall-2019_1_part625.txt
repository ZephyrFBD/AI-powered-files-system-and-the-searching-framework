ey technique that molecular biologists 
use to amplify a specific sequence of DNA. Developed by Kary Mullis in 1983, PCR 
produces millions of copies of a DNA sequence in a few hours, with the original 
sequence serving as the template for replication. PCR has a variety of applications, 
including DNA cloning, determining DNA-based phylogeny, diagnosing hereditary 
diseases, and identifying genetic fingerprints. Ask your teacher if you can learn to 
perform PCR. PCR usually requires a relatively expensive piece of equipment, a 
DNA thermocycler; however, you can investigate less expensive methods of PCR.
