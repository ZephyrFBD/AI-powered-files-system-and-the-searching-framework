In sickle cell anemia, the shape of the red blood cell is crescent-shaped, elongated, and stiffened,
reducing its ability to deliver oxygen (Figure 30.21). In this form, red blood cells cannot pass through the capillaries. This
is painful when it occurs. Thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in either the alpha or the beta subunit
of Hb. Patients with thalassemia produce a high number of red blood cells, but these cells have lower-than-normal levels of
hemoglobin. Therefore, the oxygen-carrying capacity is diminished.
