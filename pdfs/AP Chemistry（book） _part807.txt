explosive. Alfred Nobel used 
it to make dynamite in 1866. Rather surprisingly, it also is used as a medication, to relieve angina (chest pains resulting from 
partially blocked arteries to the heart) by dilating the blood vessels. At 1 atm pressure and 25 °C, the enthalpy of decomposition 
of trinitroglycerin to form nitrogen gas, carbon dioxide gas, liquid water, and oxygen gas is -1541.4 kJ>mol.
(a) Write a balanced chemical equation for the decomposition of trinitroglycerin.
(b) Calculate the standard heat of formation of trinitroglycerin.
(c) A standard dose of trinitroglycerin for relief of angina is 0.60 mg. If the sample is eventually oxidized in the body (not explosively, 
though!) to nitrogen gas, carbon dioxide gas, and liquid water, what number of calories is released?
(d) One common form of trinitroglycerin melts at about 3 °C. From this information and the formula for the substance, would you 
expect it to be a molecular or ionic compound? Explain.
(e) Describe the variou
