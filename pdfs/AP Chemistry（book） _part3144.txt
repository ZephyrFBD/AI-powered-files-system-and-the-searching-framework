 a nonspontaneous 
reaction, as discussed in the “Chemistry and Life” box in 
Section 19.7. (d) The reaction of CH4 and O2 to form C2H6 
and H2O must be carried out carefully to avoid a competing 
reaction. What is the most likely competing reaction?

Cells use the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as 
a source of energy (Figure 19.16). The conversion of ATP to 
ADP has a standard free-energy change of -30.5 kJ>mol. If 
all the free energy from the metabolism of glucose,
C6H12O61s2 + 6 O21g2 ¡ 6 CO21g2 + 6 H2O1l2
goes into the conversion of ADP to ATP
, how many moles of 
ATP can be produced for each mole of glucose?
 
[19.102] The potassium-ion concentration in blood plasma is 
about 5.0 * 10-3 M, whereas the concentration in mus-
cle-cell fluid is much greater (0.15 M ). The plasma and 
intracellular fluid are separated by the cell membrane, 
which we assume is permeable only to K+. (a) What is ∆G 
for the transfer of 1 mol of K+ from blood plasma to the
