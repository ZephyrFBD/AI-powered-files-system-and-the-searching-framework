t in neutral variation—variations between organisms that do not seem to
affect evolutionary fitness.
ii. Many, if not most, of the DNA differences between members of the same species, such as those
revealed by DNA fingerprinting, may not affect an organism’s fitness.
iii. Neutral variation may be important during evolution because environmental conditions vary over
time, and a variation that is neutral under one set of conditions may be beneficial under a different
set of conditions.
iv. Sometimes the variation can improve the evolutionary fitness of the individual under a certain set
of conditions; for example, sickle cell anemia allows those with this condition to be less likely to
contract malaria, and in parts of the world in which malaria is rampant, avoiding contracting
malaria improves one’s evolutionary fitness under those conditions.
3. Polyploidy—occurs in plants, can create new species in one or a few generations.
4. Allelic variation—germ cell mutations create the allelic v
