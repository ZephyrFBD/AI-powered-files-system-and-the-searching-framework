photographic film placed on the
viewing screen. The arrow marks the
central fringe. (b) Graph of the
intensity of light in the interference
pattern. Also shown are values of m
for Eq. 24–2a (constructive
interference) and Eq. 24–2b
(destructive interference).

The intensity of the bright fringes is greatest for the central fringe 
and
decreases for higher orders, as shown in Fig. 24–9. How much the intensity
decreases with increasing order depends on the width of the two slits.
Line spacing for double-slit interference. A screen
containing two slits 0.100 mm apart is 1.20 m from the viewing screen. Light of
wavelength
falls on the slits from a distant source. Approximately
how far apart will adjacent bright interference fringes be on the screen?
APPROACH The angular position of bright (constructive interference) fringes
is found using Eq. 24–2a.
