s citrus fruits their characteristic tangy, sour 
tastes (Figure 16.1).
ACID–BASE 
EQUILIBRIA
◀ CITRUS FRUITS. Oranges, lemons, and other fruits contain several 
acids that contribute to their characteristic flavors.
 
16.1 ▶  Arrhenius Acids and Bases Recall 
that the Arrhenius definitions of acids and 
bases are the ones we learned early on: 
acids are compounds that increase the 
proton ion concentration in water, and bases 
are compounds that increase the hydroxide 
ion concentration in water.
 16.2 ▶  Brønsted–Lowry Acids and Bases  
Learn that a Brønsted–Lowry acid is a 
proton donor and a Brønsted–Lowry base is 
a proton acceptor. Two species that differ 
by the presence or absence of a proton are 
known as a conjugate acid–base pair.
 
16.3 ▶  The Autoionization of Water  
Recognize that the autoionization of water 
produces small quantities of H3O+ and 
OH- ions. The equilibrium constant for 
autoionization, Kw = 3H3O+43OH-4 defines 
the relationship between H3O+ and OH-
