uaternary structure is maintained by the same types of 
interactions that maintain the tertiary structure.
One of the most fascinating current hypotheses in biochemistry is that misfolded 
proteins can cause infectious disease. These infectious misfolded proteins are called pri-
ons. The best example of a prion is the one thought to be responsible for mad cow dis-
ease, which can be transmitted to humans.
24.8 ∣ Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are an important class of naturally occurring substances found in both 
plant and animal matter. The name carbohydrate (“hydrate of carbon”) comes 
from the empirical formulas for most substances in this class, which can be written as 
Cx1H2O2y. For example, glucose, the most abundant carbohydrate, has the molecular 
formula C6H12O6, or C61H2O26. Carbohydrates are not really hydrates of carbon; rather, 
they are polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones. Glucose, for example, is a six-carbon alde-
hyde sugar, whereas fructose, the sugar that occurs widely in
