(a) 65Cu contains two more protons than 63Cu.
(b) 63Cu must be more abundant than 65Cu.
(c) All copper atoms have a mass of 63.546 amu.
 
â–¶Practice Exercise 2
Three isotopes of silicon occur in nature: 28Si 192.23%2, atomic 
mass 27.97693 amu; 29Si 14.68%2, atomic mass 28.97649 amu; 
and 30Si 13.09%2, atomic mass 29.97377 amu. Calculate the 
atomic weight of silicon.
SOLUTION
We can calculate the atomic weight by multiplying the abun-
dance of each isotope by its mass and summing these products. 
Because 75.78% = 0.7578 and 24.22% = 0.2422,  
we have
 Atomic weight = 10.75782134.969 amu2 + 10.24222136.966 amu2 
 = 26.50 amu + 8.953 amu 
 = 35.45 amu
This answer makes sense: The atomic weight, which is actually 
the average atomic mass, is between the masses of the two isotopes 
and is closer to the value of 35Cl, the more abundant isotope.
