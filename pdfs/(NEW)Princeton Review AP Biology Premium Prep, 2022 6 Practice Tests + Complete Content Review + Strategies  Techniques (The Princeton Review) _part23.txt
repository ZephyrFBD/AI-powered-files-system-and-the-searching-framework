f beak size and strength. The
differences are believed to have occurred as a result of allopatric speciation acting on the finch populations.
Which of the following best explains how the finch populations developed different beaks?
(A) As finches migrated between islands, alleles were transferred between populations through the process of
gene flow.
(B) Genetic drift occurred due to a hurricane near the islands, causing a bottleneck effect.
(C) Through convergent evolution, the finches developed comparable features due to being exposed to
comparable selective pressures.
(D) Geographic isolation between the different islands kept the populations from breeding with each other, and
each population evolved separately.
11. Figure 1 shows a cell at the onset of meiosis (just prior to initiation of prophase I) and the resulting 4 gametes
achieved at the end of meiosis. Select the statement that is likely true.

(A) Meiosis occurred as it should.
(B) The
