g pool filled
with water by measuring the width 
and then
noting that the far bottom edge of the pool is just visible 
at an angle of 13.0° above the horizontal as shown in
Fig. 23–62. Calculate the depth of the pool.
(x = 6.50 m)
78. (a) A plane mirror can be considered a limiting case of a
spherical mirror. Specify what this limit is. (b) Determine
an equation that relates the image and object distances in
this limit of a plane mirror. (c) Determine the magnification
of a plane mirror in this same limit. (d) Are your results in
parts (b) and (c) consistent with the discussion of Section 23–2
on plane mirrors?

Problem 84.
81. Suppose a ray strikes the left face of the prism in Fig. 23–64
at 45.0° as shown, but is totally internally reflected at the
opposite side. If the apex angle (at the top) is
what can you say about the index of refraction of the prism?
82. (a) An object 37.5 cm in front of a certain lens is imaged
8.20 cm in front of that lens (on the same side as the
