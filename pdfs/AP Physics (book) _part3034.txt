Electron diffraction. The wave nature of electrons is mani-
fested in experiments where an electron beam interacts with the atoms on the
surface of a solid, especially crystals. By studying the angular distribution of the
diffracted electrons, one can indirectly measure the geometrical arrangement of
atoms. Assume that the electrons strike perpendicular to the surface of a solid
(see Fig. 27–13), and that their energy is low,
so that they interact
only with the surface layer of atoms. If the smallest angle at which a diffraction
maximum occurs is at 24°, what is the separation d between the atoms on the
surface?
SOLUTION Treating the electrons as waves, we need to determine the condi-
tion where the difference in path traveled by the wave diffracted from adjacent
atoms is an integer multiple of the de Broglie wavelength, so that constructive
interference occurs. The path length difference is 
(Fig. 27–13); so for the
smallest value of we must have
