et reaction, equation (3). Because equation (1) has 
C(s) as a reactant, we can use that equation just as it is. We need to 
turn equation (2) around, however, so that CO(g) is a product. Re-
member that when reactions are turned around, the sign of ∆H is 
reversed. We arrange the two equations so that they can be added  
to give the desired equation:
 C1s2 + O21g2 ¡ CO21g2  
∆H = -393.5 kJ
 
CO21g2 ¡  CO1g2 + 1
2 O21g2 
- ∆H =    283.0 kJ
C1s2 + 1
2 O21g2 ¡  CO1g2  
∆H = -110.5 kJ
When we add the two equations, CO21g2 appears on both sides 
of the arrow and therefore cancels out. Likewise, 1
2 O21g2 is elimi-
nated from each side.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Calculate ∆H for 2 NO1g2 + O21g2 ¡ N2O41g2, using the 
following information:
N2O41g2 ¡ 2 NO21g2   
∆H = +57.9 kJ
2 NO1g2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 NO21g2   
∆H = -113.1 kJ
(a) 2.7 kJ  (b) -55.2 kJ  (c) -85.5 kJ  (d) -171.0 kJ  (e) +55.2 kJ
