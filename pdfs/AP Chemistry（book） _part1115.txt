How do the periodic trends in metallic character compare to those for 
ionization energy?

and ductile.
The elements can be broadly grouped as metals, nonmetals, and metalloids 
(Figure 7.13). 
 (Section 2.5) Some of the distinguishing properties of metals and non-
metals are summarized in Table 7.3.
In the following sections, we explore some common patterns of reactivity across 
the periodic table. We will examine reactivity for selected nonmetals and metals in more 
depth in later chapters.
The more an element exhibits the physical and chemical properties of metals, the 
greater its metallic character. As indicated in Figure 7.13, metallic character generally 
increases as we proceed down a group of the periodic table and decreases as we proceed 
right across a period. Let’s now examine the close relationships that exist between elec-
