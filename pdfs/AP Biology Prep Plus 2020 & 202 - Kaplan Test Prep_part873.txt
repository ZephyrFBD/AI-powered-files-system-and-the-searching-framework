, graph the predicted shape of the aerobic respiration
energy curve as oxygen becomes limited aȇer a few hours of exercise. 
(c)
The reaction of phosphocreatine + ADP to ATP + creatine is reversible, and
during periods of rest the store of phosphocreatine is regenerated.
Explain how cellular respiration returns muscles to normal aȇer exercise.
(d)
The trp operon encodes biosynthetic enzymes to produce the amino acid
tryptophan in E. coli. The expression of the structural genes (trpE to trpA) is
regulated by a repressor protein (encoded by trpR) that binds the operator.
When tryptophan is present, the operon is not transcribed.
6.
Answers and Explanations
Figure 1. trp operon in E. coli
Describe how the trp operon is turned oﬀ when tryptophan levels are
high.
(a)
Describe how the trp operon is turned on when tryptophan levels are low.
(b)
Predict ONE eﬀect a mutation in the trpR gene might have on gene
regulation.
(c)
Explain the feedback mechanism used by the trp operon.
