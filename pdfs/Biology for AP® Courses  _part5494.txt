t of mammalian
genomes results from reverse transcription. On the most basic level
if messaging changes then that sequence must lead to changes in
DNA which is receiving and transmiĴing those communications.
How can introducing synthetic material into cells not change the
cells where DNA is located? The process is known as transfection
which is deﬁned as ‘a technique to insert foreign nucleic acid (DNA
or RNA) into a cell, typically with the intention of altering the
properties of the cell’. Researchers at the Sloan KeĴering Institute in
New York found that changes in messenger RNA can deactivate
tumour-suppressing proteins and thereby promote cancer. This is
what happens when you mess with messaging. ‘Covid vaccine’
maker Moderna was founded in 2010 by Canadian stem cell
biologist Derrick J. Rossi aĞer his breakthrough discovery in the ﬁeld
of transforming and reprogramming stem cells. These are neutral
cells that can be programmed to become any cell including sperm
cells. Moderna was
