General Conclusions about s and p Bonding
On the basis of the examples we have seen, we can draw a few helpful conclusions for 
using hybrid orbitals to describe molecular structures:
 t Every pair of bonded atoms shares one or more pairs of electrons. Each bond line 
we draw in a Lewis structures represents two shared electrons. In every s bond one 
pair of electrons is localized in the space between the atoms. The appropriate set of 
hybrid orbitals used to form the s bonds between an atom and its neighbors is deter-
mined by the observed geometry of the molecule. The correlation between the set of 
hybrid orbitals and the geometry about an atom is given in Table 9.4.
 t Because the electrons in s bonds are localized in the region between two bonded 
 
atoms, they do not make a significant contribut
