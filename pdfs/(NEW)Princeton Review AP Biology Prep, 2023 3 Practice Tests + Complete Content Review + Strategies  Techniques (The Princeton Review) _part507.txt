LAB 3: COMPARING DNA SEQUENCES TO UNDERSTAND
EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS WITH BLAST
This laboratory uses BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool), a database that allows you to input a DNA
sequence for a gene to look for similar or identical sequences present in other species. In order to understand
everything you need for the AP Exam, you need to be able to do the following:
Look at a phylogenic tree, which is a way to visually represent evolutionary relatedness. Endpoints of each
branch correspond to a specific species, and each junction on the tree represents a common ancestor. Species
that are closer on a phylogenic tree are more closely related.
Understand BLAST scoring. Most phylogenic trees are constructed by examining nucleotide sequences; the
more identical two speciesâ€™ sequences are for a specific gene, the more closely related they are. BLAST is able
to analyze different sequences to tell you how similar they are to one another b
