 three types of ecosystem pyramids are
pyramids of energy, number and biomass out of
which number and biomass pyramids can be
inverted. Examples of inverted pyramids of
number and biomass are temperate forests in
summer and Silver Springs ecosystem in Florida
respectively.

31. Why do scientists more commonly analyze net primary
productivity compared with gross primary productivity?
a.
Net primary productivity incorporates features
like production at present and next trophic
levels, whereas gross primary productivity does
not.
b.
Net primary productivity is the rate at which
photosynthetic primary producers incorporate
energy from the sun.
c.
As net primary productivity is the energy content
available to the organisms
