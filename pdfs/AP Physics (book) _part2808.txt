 the field of view is small.
The second type, shown in Fig. 25–23b, is often called a spyglass and makes use 
of a third convex lens that acts to make the image upright as shown. A spyglass
must be quite long. The most practical design today is the prism binocular which
was shown in Fig. 23–28. The objective and eyepiece are converging lenses. The
prisms reflect the rays by total internal reflection and shorten the physical size of
the device, and they also act to produce an upright image. One prism reinverts
the image in the vertical plane, the other in the horizontal plane.

25–5 Compound Microscope
The compound microscope, like the telescope, has both objective and eyepiece
(or ocular) lenses, Fig. 25–24. The design is different from that for a telescope
because a microscope is used to view objects that are very close, so the object
distance is very small. The object is
