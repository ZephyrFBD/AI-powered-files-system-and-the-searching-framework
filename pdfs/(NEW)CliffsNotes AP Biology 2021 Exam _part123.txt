rgonic metabolic reactions.

In order for life to persist, living things require a constant input of free energy. That energy is used to maintain order
in opposition to the entropy that increases as a result of chemical reactions. Without an input of free energy, entropy
increases, cells deteriorate, and death follows. Photosynthesis, the process of incorporating energy from sunlight
into carbohydrates, and respiration, the process of extracting energy from those carbohydrates, provide the free
energy that allows cells to maintain order, minimize entropy, and remain alive.
Generating ATP
Phosphorylation is the process of adding energy and an inorganic phosphate to ADP to make ATP:
 
energy + Pi + ADP â†’ ATP There are two basic mechanisms of phosphorylation in cells:
1. Substrate level phosphorylation occurs when a phosphate group and its associated energy are transferred to
ADP to form ATP. The substrate molecule (a molecule with the phosphate group) donates the high energy
