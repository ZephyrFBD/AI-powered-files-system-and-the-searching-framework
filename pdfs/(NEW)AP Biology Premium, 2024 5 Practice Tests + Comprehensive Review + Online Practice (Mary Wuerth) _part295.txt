ss in living organisms. Information is transferred within an
organism from the nucleus to the ribosome during the synthesis of proteins (which will be reviewed in Chapter 16).
Information is transferred from generation to generation through inherited units of chemical information called
genes. Information can be transferred between members of the same generation through the processes of
conjugation, transformation, or transduction (all of which will be discussed in Chapter 17). In all cases, the carriers
of this genetic information are DNA and RNA.
DNA, RNA, and ribosomes are found in all forms of life. DNA and RNA use a genetic code that is shared by all
living organisms. This provides powerful evidence to support the common ancestry of all living organisms on Earth.
Mendel’s laws of segregation and independent assortment explain how genetic information can be transferred
from one generation to the next.
It is important to note that Mendel’s laws of segregation and independent assortm
