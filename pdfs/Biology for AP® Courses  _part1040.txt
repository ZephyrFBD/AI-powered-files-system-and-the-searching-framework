second messengers. Because these molecules are membrane components, they are located near membrane-bound receptors
and can easily interact with them. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is the main phospholipid that plays a role in cellular signaling.
Enzymes known as kinases phosphorylate PI to form PI-phosphate (PIP) and PI-bisphosphate (PIP2).
The enzyme phospholipase C cleaves PIP2 to form diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) (Figure 9.13).
These products of the cleavage of PIP2 serve as second messengers. Diacylglycerol (DAG) remains in the plasma membrane
and activates protein kinase C (PKC), which then phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in its target proteins. IP3
diffuses into the cytoplasm and binds to ligand-gated calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2+ that
continues the signal cascade.
Figure 9.13 The enzyme phospholipase C breaks down PIP2 into IP3 and DAG, both of which serve as second
messengers.
