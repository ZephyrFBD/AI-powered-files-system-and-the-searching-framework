mass (the total weight of all the organisms in an area) and the greatest numbers. Did you know that
plants make up about 99 percent of the Earthâ€™s total biomass?
Consumers (heterotrophs)
Consumers, or heterotrophs, are forced to find their energy sources in the outside world. Basically, heterotrophs
digest the carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids of their prey into carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, etc. and use
these molecules to make organic substances. Recall that organisms digest macromolecules into smaller monomers
by utilizing a hydrolysis reaction.
The bottom line is that heterotrophs, or consumers, get their energy from the things they consume.
Primary consumers are organisms that directly feed on producers. A good example is a cow. These organisms are
also known as herbivores. They make up the second trophic level.
The next level consists of organisms that feed on primary consumers. They are the secondary consumers, and they
make up the third trophic level. Above these ar
