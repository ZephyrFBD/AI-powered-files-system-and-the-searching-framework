 cholesterol molecules are also found in the phospholipid bilayer
because they help stabilize membrane fluidity in animal cells.
The Nucleus
The nucleus is usually the largest organelle in the cell. The nucleus not only directs what goes on in the cell, but is
also responsible for the cell’s ability to reproduce. It’s the home of the hereditary information—DNA—which is
organized into large structures called chromosomes. The most visible structure within the nucleus is the nucleolus,
which is where rRNA is made and ribosomes are assembled.
Ribosomes
The ribosomes are sites of protein synthesis. Their job is to manufacture all the proteins required by the cell or
secreted by the cell. Ribosomes are round structures composed of two subunits, the large subunit and the small
subunit. The structure is composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins. Ribosomes can be either free floating in
the cell or attached to another structure called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
Ribosomes are found in b
