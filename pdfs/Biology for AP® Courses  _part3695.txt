which include the neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, and the agranulocytes, which include the monocytes and
lymphocytes.

Figure 31.7 (a) Granulocytes—including neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils—are characterized by a lobed nucleus
and granular inclusions in the cytoplasm. Granulocytes are typically first-responders during injury or infection. (b)
Agranulocytes include lymphocytes and monocytes. Lymphocytes, including B and T cells, are responsible for adaptive
immune response. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells, which in turn respond to infection or
injury.
Granulocytes contain granules in their cytoplasm; the agranulocytes are so named because of the lack of granules in their
cytoplasm. Some leukocytes become macrophages that either stay at the same site or move through the blood stream and
gather at sites of infection or inflammation where they are attracted by chemical signals fro
