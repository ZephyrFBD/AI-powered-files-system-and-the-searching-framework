cell contact initiates a series of events that leads
to production of antibodies by B lymphocytes.
b.
The vaccine introduces antigens specific to a
pathogen into the person’s blood. These antigens
bind to the receptors on the surface of T cells.

c.
The vaccine introduces antigens specific to a
pathogen into the person’s blood. These antigens
are moved to the cell surface of antigen-
presenting cells present in the blood. This direct

The vaccine introduces antigens specific to a
pathogen into the person’s blood. These antigens
are moved to the cell surface of antigen-
presenting cells present in the blood. Receptors
on helper T cells bind to the antigens present on
the antigen-presenting cell. This direct cell-to-
