 written out in paragraph form; outline form 
is not acceptable . Do not spend time restating the questions or 
providing more than the number of examples called for . For instance, 
if a question calls for two examples, you can earn credit only for the 
first two examples that you provide . Labeled diagrams may be used 
to supplement discussion, but unless specifically called for by the 
question, a diagram alone will not receive credit . Write clearly and 
legibly . Begin each answer on a new page . Do not skip lines . Cross out 
any errors you make; crossed-out work will not be scored .
Manage your time carefully . You may proceed freely from one question 
to the next . You may review your responses if you finish before the end 
of the exam is announced .
