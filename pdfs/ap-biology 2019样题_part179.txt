o 
promoter regions affects 
gene expression and/or the 
phenotype of the organism.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-2.C.1
Promoters are DNA sequences upstream of the 
transcription start site where RNA polymerase 
and transcription factors bind to initiate 
transcription.
IST-2.C.2
Negative regulatory molecules inhibit gene 
expression by binding to DNA and blocking 
transcription.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
IST-2
Differences in the expression of genes account for some of the phenotypic 
differences between organisms.

IST-2.D
Explain the connection 
between the regulation 
of gene expression and 
phenotypic differences in 
cells and organisms.
IST-2.D.1
Gene regulation results in differential gene 
expression and influences cell products and 
function.
