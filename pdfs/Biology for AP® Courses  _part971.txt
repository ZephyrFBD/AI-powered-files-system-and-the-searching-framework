ons of the visible spectrum and can capture energy from sunlight.
Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to assemble carbohydrate molecules and release oxygen as a waste product
into the atmosphere. Eukaryotic autotrophs, such as plants and algae, have organelles called chloroplasts in which
photosynthesis takes place, and starch accumulates. In prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, the process is less localized and
occurs within folded membranes, extensions of the plasma membrane, and in the cytoplasm.
8.2 The Light-Dependent Reaction of Photosynthesis
The pigments of the first part of photosynthesis, the light-dependent reactions, absorb energy from sunlight. A photon
strikes the antenna pigments of photosystem II to initiate photosynthesis. The energy travels to the reaction center that
contains chlorophyll a and then to the electron transport chain, which pumps hydrogen ions into the thylakoid interior.
This action builds up a high concentration of ions. The ions flow through A
