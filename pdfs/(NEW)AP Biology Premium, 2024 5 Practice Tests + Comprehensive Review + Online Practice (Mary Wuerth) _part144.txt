T is the temperature of the solution. The temperature is in Kelvin, NOT degrees Celsius. There are two reasons
why temperature must be stated in Kelvin:
The pressure constant, R, uses temperature units of Kelvin, so consistent units for temperature are needed
throughout the formula.
The Kelvin temperature scale is an absolute scale, meaning there are no negative numbers in the Kelvin scale.
Using negative temperatures in this formula would result in incorrect water potential calculations.
Converting temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin is simple: Kelvin = °C + 273.
The reference solution for solute potential is distilled water. Because distilled water has no solutes, C = 0, and the
solute potential for distilled water is 0 bars at any temperature. As soon as any amount of solute is added to distilled
water, the solution’s solute potential will become negative. The more solute that is added, the more negative
