number of chromosomes of the parent cell. 
b. Meiosis involves two rounds of a sequential 
series of steps (meiosis I and meiosis II).

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-1.H
Explain how the process of 
meiosis generates genetic 
diversity.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.H.1
Separation of the homologous chromosomes 
in meiosis I ensures that each gamete 
receives a haploid (1n) set of chromosomes 
that c
