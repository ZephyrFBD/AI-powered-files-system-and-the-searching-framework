igens are present on their blood cells.

3. Eukaryotic chromosomes can be tightly packed as
heterochromatin or can be more loosely packed as euchromatin.
What is the best prediction regarding the expression of genes in
heterochromatin and euchromatin?
RNA polymerase can access the promoters in euchromatin
more easily than it can access the promoters in
heterochromatin, so euchromatin is transcribed more readily
than heterochromatin.
(A)
RNA polymerase can access the promoters in
heterochromatin more easily than it can access the
promoters in euchromatin, so heterochromatin is transcribed
more readily than euchromatin.
(B)
DNA polymerase can access promoters in euchromatin more
easily than it can access the promoters in heterochromatin,
so euchromatin is transcribed more readily than
heterochromatin.
(C)
DNA polymerase can access promoters in heterochromatin
more easily than it can access the promoters in euchromatin,
so heterochromatin is transcribed more readily than
euchromatin.
