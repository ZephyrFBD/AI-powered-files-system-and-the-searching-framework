rt chain reactions occur in 
chloroplasts, mitochondria, and prokaryotic 
plasma membranes.
b. In cellular respiration, electrons delivered 
by NADH and FADH  are passed to a series 
of electron acceptor
2
s as they move toward 
the terminal electron acceptor, oxygen. 
In photosynthesis, the terminal electron 
acceptor is NADP+. Aerobic prokaryotes use 
oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, while 
anaerobic prokaryotes use other molecules.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-1.K
Describe the processes 
that allow organisms to use 
energy stored in biological 
macromolecules.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
ENE-1
The highly complex organization of living systems requires constant input of energy 
and the exchange of macromolecules.
SUGGESTED SKILL
Representing and 
Describing Data
4.A
Construct a graph, plot,  
or chart.
