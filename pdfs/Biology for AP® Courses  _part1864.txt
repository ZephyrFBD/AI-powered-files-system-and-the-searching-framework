left the foreign genomic DNA
you are planning to clone on the lab bench overnight instead of storing it in the freezer. As a result, it was degraded
by nucleases, but still used in the experiment. The plasmid, on the other hand, is fine. What results would you expect
from your molecular cloning experiment?
a.
There will be no colonies on the bacterial plate.
b.
There will be blue colonies only.
c.
There will be blue and white colonies.
d.
The will be white colonies only.

What are the functions of the restriction enzymes and DNA ligase in recombination?
a.
Restriction enzymes restrict the recombination process. DNA ligase ligates the products of recombination
with each other.
b.
DNA ligase splices DNA at a specific point, so the new piece of DNA
