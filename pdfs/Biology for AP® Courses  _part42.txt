The AP® Biology Science Practices are presented to students through several active learning features.
Science Practice Connections for AP® Courses provide a context and suggested activity linking the concepts with the
relevant science practices. Students are often asked to build representations, undertake brief research, or answer critical
thinking questions.
Science Practice Questions, designed and authored by John Eggebrecht and Julianne Zedalis, present a complex scenario
