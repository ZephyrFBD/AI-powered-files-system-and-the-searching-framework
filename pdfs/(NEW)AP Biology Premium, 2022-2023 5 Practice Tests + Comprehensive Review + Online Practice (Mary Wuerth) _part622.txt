nd plate D contains agar with streptomycin, no E. coli will grow
on plate D. Choices (A) and (C) are incorrect because both of those plates do NOT contain streptomycin, so
many, many E. coli colonies will be found on those plates. Choice (B) is incorrect because although this plate
does contain agar with streptomycin, Tube 1 received the plasmid that confers resistance to streptomycin, so
some E. coli will grow on that plate. However, not every E. coli cell will absorb the plasmid, so plate B will
have fewer bacterial colonies than plates A or C.
6. (C) The E. coli in Tube 2 did not receive the plasmid, so no growth is expected on plate D; however, there is a
very small probability that a spontaneous mutation occurred in some of the E. coli cells that gave them
resistance to streptomycin. Choice (A) is incorrect because no plasmid was added to Tube 2. There is no
evidence that E. coli catabolize the antibiotic and individual bacteria do not learn how to catabolize an
antibiotic, so cho
