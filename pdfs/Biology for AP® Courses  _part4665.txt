per underground,
on land and at sea, are fossil fuels: the anaerobically decomposed remains of plants that take millions of years to form.
Fossil fuels are considered a non-renewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation. A non-renewable
resource, such as fossil fuel, is either regenerated very slowly or not at all. Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere
is from land (including land beneath the surface of the ocean) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems.
Carbon sediments from the ocean floor are taken deep within the Earth by the process of subduction: the movement of one
tectonic plate beneath another. Carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal
vents.
Carbon dioxide is also added to the atmosphere by the animal husbandry practices of humans. The large numbers of land
animals raised to feed the Earthâ€™s growing population results in increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere due to
