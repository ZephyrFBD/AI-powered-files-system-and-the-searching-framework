In a well-designed laser, the spreading of the beam is limited only by diffrac-
tion, so the angular spread is
(see Eq.24–3 or 25–7) where D is the diameter
of the end mirror. The diffraction spreading can be incredibly small. The light
energy, instead of spreading out in space as it does for an ordinary light source, can
be a pencil-thin beam.
Creating an Inverted Population
The excitation of the atoms in a laser can be done in several ways to produce the
necessary inverted population. In a ruby laser, the lasing material is a ruby rod
consisting of 
with a small percentage of aluminum (Al) atoms replaced b
