hese very high tempera-
tures); the first reaction can be written as
where
proton and
deuteron. The net effect of this sequence, which is
called the proton;proton chain, is for four protons to combine to form one 
nucleus plus two positrons, two neutrinos, and two gamma rays:
(31;7)
Note that it takes two of each of the first two reactions (Eqs.31–6a and b) to produce
the two 
for the third reaction. So the total energy release for the net reaction,
Eq. 31–7, is
In addi-
tion, each of the two 
(Eq.31–6a) quickly annihilates with an electron to produce
rays (Section 27–6) with total energy
so the total energy
released is
The first reaction, the
formation of deuterium from two protons (Eq. 31–6a), has a very low probability,
and so limits the rate at which the Sun produces energy. (Thank goodness! This 
is why the Sun is still shining brightly.)
