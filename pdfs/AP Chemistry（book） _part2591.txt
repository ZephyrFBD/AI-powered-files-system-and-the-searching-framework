▶Practice Exercise 2
(a) Based on information in Appendix D, which of these anions 
has the largest base-dissociation constant: NO2
-, PO4
3 -, or N3
-?
(b) The base quinoline has the structure
N
Its conjugate acid is listed in handbooks as having a pKa of 4.90. 
What is the base-dissociation constant for quinoline?
Kb =
Kw
Ka
= 1.0 * 10-14
6.8 * 10-4 = 1.5 * 10-11
Ka =
Kw
Kb
= 1.0 * 10-14
1.8 * 10-5 = 5.6 * 10-10
SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 16.17 
Calculating Ka or Kb for a Conjugate Acid–Base Pair
Plan We can use the tabulated K values for HF and NH3 and the 
relationship between Ka and Kb to calculate the dissociation con-
stants for their conjugates, F - and NH4
+.
