S EQUILIBRIA (SECTION 15.4) Equilibria can 
be divided into two types: homogeneous equilibria where all of the 
reactants and products are in the same phase, and heterogeneous 
equilibria where more than one phase is present. Because their activ-
ities are exactly 1, the concentrations of pure solids and liquids are 
left out of the equilibrium-constant expression for a heterogeneous 
equilibrium.
CALCULATING EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANTS (SECTION 15.5) If 
the concentrations of all species in an equilibrium are known, the 
 
equilibrium-constant expression can be used to calculate the equilib-
rium constant. The changes in the concentrations of reactants and 
products on the way to achieving equilibrium are governed by the 
stoichiometry of the reaction.
APPLICATIONS OF EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANTS (SECTION 15.6)  
The reaction quotient, Q, is found by substituting reactant and product 
concentrations or partial pressures at any point during a reaction into 
the equilibrium-constant expression. If t
