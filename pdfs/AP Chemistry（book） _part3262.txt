iron, which is iron coated with a thin layer of zinc, the iron is pro-
tected from corrosion even after the surface coat is broken. The standard reduction 
potentials are
Fe2+1aq2 + 2 e- ¡ Fe1s2 E°
red = -0.44 V
Zn2+1aq2 + 2 e- ¡ Zn1s2 E°
red = -0.76 V
Because E°
red for Fe2+ is less negative (more positive) than E°
red for Zn2+, Zn1s2 is more read-
ily oxidized than Fe(s). Thus, even if the zinc coating is broken and the galvanized iron is 
exposed to oxygen and water, as in Figure 20.26, the zinc serves as the anode and is cor-
roded (oxidized) instead of the iron. The iron serves as the cathode at which O2 is reduced.
Protecting a metal from corrosion by making it the cathode in an electrochemical 
cell is known as cathodic protection. The metal that is oxidized while protecting the 
cathode is called the sacrificial anode. Underground pipelines 
and storage tanks made of iron are often protected against 
corrosion by making the iron the cathode of a voltaic cell. For 
example, piec
