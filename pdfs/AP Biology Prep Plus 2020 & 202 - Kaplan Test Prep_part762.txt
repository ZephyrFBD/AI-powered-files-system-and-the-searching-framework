es between cladograms A and B are the locations of
Entelognathus and Guiyu-lineage. Entelognathus diverges before the
crown gnathostomes in cladogram A and aȇer the crown
gnathostomes in cladogram B. Guiyu-lineage diverges from the
sarcopterygian lineage in cladogram A and from the actinopterygian
lineage in cladogram B. Thus, the correct answer is (D). (A) is incorrect
because the crown gnathostomes and crown osteichthyans diverged
into more than one clade in both cladograms, as indicated by the lines
branching from nodes (the dark, filled-in circles). (B) is incorrect
because, in both cladograms, the crown gnathostomes were a
common ancestor for the conventionally-defined chondrichthyans
(found at the end of the line extending from the crown gnathostome
node). (C) is incorrect because Entelognathus forms its own clade in
both cladograms, but diverges at diﬀerent points.
