Ozone is an important component of the upper atmosphere, where it screens out 
ultraviolet radiation and so protects us from the effects of these high-energy rays. For this 
reason, depletion of stratospheric ozone is a major scientific concern. 
 (Section 18.2) 
In the lower atmosphere, ozone is considered an air pollutant and is a major constituent 
of smog. 
 (Section 18.2) Because of its oxidizing power, ozone damages living systems 
and structural materials, especially rubber.
Oxides
The electronegativity of oxygen is second only to that of fluorine. As a result, oxygen has 
negative oxidation states in all compounds except OF2 and O2F2. The -2 oxidation state 
2 C2H2(g) + 5 O2(g)
∆H° = −2510 kJ
4 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g);
