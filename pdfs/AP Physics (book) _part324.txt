2. Two balls are thrown in the air at different angles, but each
reaches the same height. Which ball remains in the air longer?
Explain, using equations.
3. Show that the speed with which a projectile leaves the
ground is equal to its speed just before it strikes the
ground at the end of its journey, assuming the firing level
equals the landing level.
4. The initial angle of projectile A is 30°, while that of projec-
tile B is 60°. Both have the same level horizontal range.
How do the initial velocities and flight times (elapsed time
from launch until landing) compare for A and B?
