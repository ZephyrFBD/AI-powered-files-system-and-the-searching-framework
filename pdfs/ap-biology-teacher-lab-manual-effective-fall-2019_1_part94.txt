 sequence of a protein 
or a nucleic acid; the sequence of genes along a chromosome; the pecking order of a 
hierarchically organized social group within a chicken coop; the trophic levels from 
producers to primary, secondary, tertiary consumers in a food chain; or the substrate-
product series of metabolic pathways or signal cascades. 
â–  Problem Solving 
Students learn to become good problem solvers by doing problem solving, rather than 
just hearing or reading about how scientists solve problems. This requires a great deal 
of practice, with students working on many different types of problems, such as (1) 
determining the sequence of a nucleic acid from a series of overlapping fragments 
generated by the use of fragments by restriction endonucleases; (2) determining the 
frequency of an allele in a population from electrophoretic analysis of enzymes or DNA 
fragments from several individuals; (3) determining the genotype of an individual given 
its phenotype and the genotypes of se
