Other Types of Fermentation
Other fermentation methods occur in bacteria. Many prokaryotes are facultatively anaerobic. This means that they can
switch between aerobic respiration and fermentation, depending on the availability of oxygen. Certain prokaryotes, like
Clostridia, are obligate anaerobes. Obligate anaerobes live and grow in the absence of molecular oxygen. Oxygen is a
poison to these microorganisms and kills them on exposure. It should be noted that all forms of fermentation, except lactic
acid fermentation, produce gas. The production of particular types of gas is used as an indicator of the fermentation of
specific carbohydrates, which plays a role in the laboratory identification of the bacteria. Various methods of fermentation
are used by assorted organisms to ensure an adequate supply of NAD+ for the sixth step in glycolysis. Without these
pathways, that step would not occ
