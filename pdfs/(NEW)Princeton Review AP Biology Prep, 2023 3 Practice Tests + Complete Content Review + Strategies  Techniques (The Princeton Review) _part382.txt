We know now that Lamarck’s theory was wrong: acquired changes—that is, changes at a “macro” level in an
organism’s regular (somatic) body cells—will not appear in gamete cells. For example, if you were to lose one of
your fingers, your children would not inherit this trait. The gametes that your body makes include copies of your
regular old genome, not a new version of a genome that is determined by how careful you are with a table saw.
Don’t be Lamarck!
Remember, Lamarck was wrong. Do not take a Lamarckian position on the AP
Exam..
Evidence for Evolution
In essence, nature “selects” which living things survive and reproduce. Evidence supports the theory that all living
organisms share a common ances
