9. If Figure 1 were to include additional data for higher concentrations of JB-76, how would the reaction rate
change?
(A) The reaction rate would be lower than any reaction rate shown in Figure 1.
(B) The reaction rate would be higher than any reaction rate shown in Figure 1.
(C) The reaction rate would be equal to the highest reaction rate shown in Figure 1.
(D) The reaction rate would increase gradually for each concentration of JB-76 added.
10. The Galapagos Islands contain about 15 species of finches that vary in terms of beak size and strength. The
differences are believed to have occurred as a result of allopatric speciation acting on the finch populations.
Which of the following best explains how the finch populations developed different beaks?
(A) As finches migrated between islands, alleles were transferred between populations through the process of
gene flow.
(B) Genetic drift occurred due to a hurricane near the islands, causing a bottleneck effect.
(C) Through
