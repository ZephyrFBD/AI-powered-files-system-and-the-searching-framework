Problem 47.
51. (II) A child on a sled reaches the bottom of a hill with a
velocity of 
and travels 25.0 m along a horizontal
straightaway to a stop. If the child and sled together have 
a mass of 60.0 kg, what is the average retarding force on
the sled on the horizontal straightaway?
52. (II) (a) A box sits at rest on a rough 33° inclined plane.
Draw the free-body diagram, showing all the forces acting
on the box. (b) How would the diagram change if the box
were sliding down the plane? (c) How would it change if 
the box were sliding up the plane after an initial shove?

48. (II) A small box is held in place against a rough vertical
wall by someone pushing on it with a force directed upward
at 28° above the horizontal. The coefficients of static and
kinetic friction between the box and wall are 0.40 and 
0.30, respectively. The box slides down unless the applied
