 must be sufficient to run 
all intended experiments so that 
there is consistency of the enzyme 
concentration in each phase. Your 
sample may be frozen if time does not 
permit you to complete your intended 
series and used at a later time, as long 
as the frozen material is not older than 
three months. 
•  Hydrogen Peroxide (0.1%): A standard 
solution of 3% H2O2 is available at most 
drug stores. Combine 15 mL of
with 435 mL of distilled water to make 
a 0.1% solution. Keep refrigerated, and 
store in brown bottles. 
•  Guaiacol: Available from numerous 
suppliers. Dilute 1.5 mL with 500 mL 
distilled water. Although very rarely, 
guaiacol has been reported as a skin 
irritant at high concentrations. Care 
should be taken when making the 
first dilution since the stock solution 
is 96–98 percent pure. Guaiacol is 
weakly soluble in water, so make the 
solution the day before and store it 
in a refrigerator. On the day of the 
experiment, place the solution in small 
brown bottles
