ne molecule of A is consumed for every molecule of B that forms, the aver-
age rate of disappearance of A equals the average rate of appearance of B:

Now let’s consider the reaction between butyl chloride 1C4H9Cl2 and water to form butyl 
alcohol 1C4H9OH2 and hydrochloric acid:
 
C4H9Cl1aq2 + H2O1l2 ¡ C4H9OH1aq2 + HCl1aq2 
[14.3]
Suppose we prepare a 0.1000@M aqueous solution of C4H9Cl and then measure 
the concentration of C4H9Cl at various times after time zero (which is the instant 
at which the reactants are mixed, thereby initiating the reaction). We can use the 
resulting data, shown in the first two columns of Table 14.1, to calculate the average 
rate of disappearance of C4H9Cl over various time intervals; these rates are given in 
the third column. Notice that the average rate decreases over each 50-s interval for 
the first several measurements and continues to decrease over
