the same layer to form interconnected hexagonal rings. The distance between adjacent 
carbon atoms in the plane, 1.42 Å, is very close to the C ¬C distance in benzene, 1.395 
Å. In fact, the bonding resembles that of benzene, with delocalized p bonds extending 
over the layers. 
 (Section 9.6) Electrons move freely through the delocalized orbitals, 
making graphite a good electrical conductor along the layers. (In fact, graphite is used 
as a conducting electrode in batteries.) These sp2@hybridized sheets of carbon atoms are 
separated by 3.35 Å from one another, and the sheets are held together only by disper-
sion forces. Thus, the layers readily slide past one another when rubbed, giving graphite 
a greasy feel. This tendency is enhanced when impurity atoms are trapped between the 
layers, as is typically the case in commercial forms of the material.
Graphite is used as a lubricant and as the “lead” in pencils. The enormous differ-
ences in physical properties of graphite and
