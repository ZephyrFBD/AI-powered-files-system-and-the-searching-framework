1. Divergent evolution describes two or more species that originate from a common ancestor and become
increasingly different over time. This may happen as a result of allopatric or sympatric speciation or by adaptive
radiation.
2. Convergent evolution describes two unrelated species that share similar traits. The similarities arise, not because
the species share a common ancestor, but because each species has independently adapted to similar ecological
conditions or lifestyles. The traits that resemble one another are called analogous traits.
Sharks, porpoises, and penguins have torpedo-shaped bodies with peripheral fins. These traits arise as a result of
adaptations to aquatic life and not because these animals inherited the traits from a recent, common ancestor.
The eyes of squids and vertebrates are physically and functionally similar. However, these animals do not share a
recent common ancestor. The fact that the eyes in these two groups of animals originate from different
