These core science practices are woven throughout the course content and throughout the course labs. Designing
an experiment and analyzing the experimental data are key skills assessed on the AP Biology exam.
On Section II of the exam, each of the long free-response questions (#1 and #2) likely involve analyses of lab
experiments. Question 1 may assess your ability to interpret and evaluate experimental results. You might be
required to describe and explain a biological process or model and identify design procedures from the experiment.
You might also need to analyze data and make and justify predictions. Question 2 may ask you to construct a graph
of experimental results using confidence intervals or error bars. You might again need to show that you can analyze
the data and predict what could happen based on the data provided. One of the four short free-response questions
might also revolve around a lab investigation, requiring you to describe the biological concept that is being
