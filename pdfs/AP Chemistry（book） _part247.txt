 1.89  A 25.0-cm-long cylindrical glass tube, sealed at one end, is 
filled with ethanol. The mass of ethanol needed to fill the tube 
is found to be 45.23 g. The density of ethanol is 0.789 g/mL. 
 
Calculate the inner diameter of the tube in centimeters.
 1.90  Gold is alloyed (mixed) with other metals to increase its 
hardness in making jewelry. (a) Consider a piece of gold jew-
elry that weighs 9.85 g and has a volume of 0.675 cm3. The 
jewelry contains only gold and silver, which have densities 
of 19.3 and 10.5 g>cm3, respectively. If the total volume of 
the jewelry is the sum of the volumes of the gold and silver 
that it contains, calculate the percentage of gold (by mass) 
in the jewelry. (b) The relative amount of gold in an alloy is 
commonly expressed in units of carats. Pure gold is 24 carat, 
and the percentage of gold in an alloy is given as a percent-
age of this value. For example, an alloy that is 50% gold is 
 
12 carat. State the purity of the gold je
