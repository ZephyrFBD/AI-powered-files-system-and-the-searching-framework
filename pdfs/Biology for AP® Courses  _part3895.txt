ever, was chosen for in-depth exploration because all organisms, including humans, must maintain
dynamic homeostasis to survive within changing environments. Even the simplest multicellular eukaryotes like sponges
and cnidarians have developed cells that specialize in immune defenses to protect against disruptions to homeostasis. News
headlines warn us of outbreaks of diseases, including Ebola, measles, flu, and insect-borne viruses such as West Nile
and chikungunya, that spread rapidly through populations, often with devastating consequences. We also hear about the
emergence of new infections, especially ones caused by bacteria that have evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Immune systems in animals range from a loose cluster of phagocytic cells in sponges to complex interactions of molecules,
cells, tissues, and organs that provide immunity in mammals. Components of the immune system constantly search the
body for signs of disease-causing microorganisms called pathogens. Immune factors
