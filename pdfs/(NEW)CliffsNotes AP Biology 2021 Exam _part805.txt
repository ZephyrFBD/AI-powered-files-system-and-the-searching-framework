ated water away from the leaf. As a result, the humidity and
the water potential in the air around the leaf drops, and the rate of transpiration increases.
4. Light intensity. When light is absorbed by the leaf, some of the light energy is converted to heat. Transpiration
rate increases with temperature. Leaves of plants growing in bright sunlight sustain higher temperatures than plants
growing in shade, and such exposure may influence stomatal density. However, somewhat countering the increase in
temperature is the cooling effect caused by heat removal through transpiration.
5. Leaf size. Because larger leaves have a greater surface area than smaller leaves, there is a greater potential for
heating and transpiration. Plants with larger leaves often grow in shade where they balance surface area and the need
for light against the need to minimize transpiration. Stomatal density may also be affected.
6. Leaf orientation. A horizontally oriented leaf maximizes surface area for the capture
