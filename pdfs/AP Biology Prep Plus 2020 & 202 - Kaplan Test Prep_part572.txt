Given that the extract contains all the cellular machinery necessary for
translation of insulin except for mRNA, the insulin will only be
produced when pancreatic mRNA (some of which will code for insulin)
is added to the mixture. (C) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because the
gene for insulin cannot be transcribed and translated without mRNA.
(B) is incorrect because the mixture already contains ribosomes and
because mRNA is needed. (D) is incorrect because the DNA is not
necessary; the mRNA transcripts are suï¬€icient, given that all of the
machinery for translation is already present in the mixture.

The conversion of the fourth codon from UAU to UAA, changes it from a
tyr to a stop signal. This is a nonsense mutation that will cause the
sequence to be prematurely terminated, generating a shorter peptide
sequence, (B). (A) is incorrect because the amino acids
