 interatomic spacing have to change
in order to produce the normal force required to support
the man? [Note: Neighboring atoms repel each other, and
this repulsion accounts for the observed normal force.]
73. A home mechanic wants to raise the 280-kg engine out of a
car. The plan is to stretch a rope vertically from the engine
to a branch of a tree 6.0 m above, and back to the bumper
(Fig. 9–88). When the mechanic climbs up a stepladder
and pulls horizontally on the rope at its midpoint, the
engine rises out of the car. (a) How much force must the
mechanic exert to hold the engine 0.50 m above its normal
position? (b) What is the system’s mechanical advantage?

74. A 2.0-m-high box with a 1.0-m-square base is moved across
a rough floor as in Fig. 9–89. The uniform box weighs 250 N
and has a coefficient of static friction with the floor of 0.60.
What minimum force must be
exerted on the box to make it
slide? What is the maximum
height h above the floor that thi
