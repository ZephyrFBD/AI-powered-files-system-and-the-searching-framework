ment? A phototactic response is a movement in response to 
light. A geotactic response is a movement in response to gravity.
You will investigate fruit fly movement using a choice chamber that exposes the flies 
to different substances that you insert into the chamber. Because flies are very common 
in households (in fact, fruit flies live almost everywhere that humans live), think about 
using foods or condiments that might result in a positive or a negative chemotactic 
response from the flies. What foods or condiments do you think would attract or repel 
flies? Why? Do fruit flies exhibit a response to light or to gravity? How can you alter the 
chamber to investigate those variables?
Step 1 Prepare a choice chamber by labeling both ends with a marker — one end “
A” and 
the other “B” (see Figure 3). Cut the bottom of the bottles, dry the interior thoroughly, 
and tape them together. Remove any paper labels.
