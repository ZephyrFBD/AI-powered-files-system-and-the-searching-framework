tal capacity (VC) measures the maximum amount of air that
can be inhaled or exhaled during a respiratory cycle. It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, and
inspiratory reserve volume. The inspiratory capacity (IC) is the amount of air that can be inhaled after the end of a normal
expiration. It is, therefore, the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume. The functional residual capacity
(FRC) includes the expiratory reserve volume and the residual volume. The FRC measures the amount of additional air that
can be exhaled after a normal exhalation. Lastly, the total lung capacity (TLC) is a measurement of the total amount of air
that the lung can hold. It is the sum of the residual volume, expiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, and inspiratory reserve
volume.
Lung volumes are measured by a technique called spirometry. An important measurement taken during spirometry is the
forced expiratory volume (FEV), which measures how much air can be forced out
