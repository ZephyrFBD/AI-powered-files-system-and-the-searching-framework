opulation. Logistic growth can be described by the following equation:
In this equation, N still represents the population size, and rmax again is the maximum per capita growth rate of
the population. K represents the carrying capacity of the environment. Carrying capacity is defined as the
maximum population that can be supported by the available resources in an environment. Notice that as the
population size increases (N becomes closer to K), the rate of growth of the population will decrease. Smaller
population sizes that are far below the carrying capacity of an environment will experience higher growth rates.
Logistic growth curves are S-shaped, as shown in Figure 23.2. Logistic growth curves start with a relatively flat
lag phase, followed by a period of exponential growth (also called the log phase), which slows as the population
reaches the carrying capacity of the environment. Logistic growth curves stabilize at or near the carrying capacity of
the environment.
