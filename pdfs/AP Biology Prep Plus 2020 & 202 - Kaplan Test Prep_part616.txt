is incorrect because transcription would not
occur without the gibberellin-dependent transcription factors, so they
are essential for the synthesis of gibberellin-dependent proteins. (D) is
incorrect because gibberellins act through gibberellin-dependent
transcription factors for transcription.

The average number of sperms per mL is the sum of the three samples
divided by 3: (125,000,000 + 95,000,000 + 110,000,000)/3 or
110,000,000. Since the number of sperms that reached the fallopian
tubes is 1,100 per mL, the percentage of sperm cells that will reach the
fallopian tubes is 1,100/110,000,000*100% or 0.001%. Therefore, (A) is
correct.

The 5’-UTR region of the RNA thermometer enables growth at 40oC.
The data shows that a mutation in this area prevents growth at 40oC
regardless of whether the coding sequence of Hps70 is mutated or not.
Thus, the correct answer is (A). (B) is incorrect because the Hsp70
protein from the mutant c
