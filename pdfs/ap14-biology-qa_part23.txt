s. Students were 
then asked to explain a process that could lead to genetic variation. Finally, students were asked to 
describe how genetic variation in a population contributes to the process of evolution, using the 
engineered fruit flies as a model. 
How well did students perform on this question? 
The mean score for this question was 1.19 out of a possible 3 points. 
What were common student errors or omissions?  
Many students confused mechanisms that lead to new genetic variation with processes that stabilize allele 
frequencies in populations (i.e., maintain Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). Students often used buzzwords 
such as “fitness” and “natural selection” without demonstrating a conceptual understanding of the terms. 
Students demonstrated misconceptions about fitness, describing it in terms of “stronger” vs. “weaker” 
individuals, or “good” vs. “bad” traits. 
Many students failed to connect the effect of new genetic variation in the population with the outcome of 
natural
