to
chemical dating techniques, geological layers were considered to be very
old. Chemical dating has allowed modern scientists to assess the age of
geological layers accurately.
Scientists have proposed two more hypotheses related to the rate of
evolution. The first hypothesis is punctuated equilibrium. The
hypothesis of punctuated equilibrium suggests that changes in
organismal form did not take millions of years. Instead, very large
changes in form happened relatively quickly (i.e., over thousands or tens
of thousands of years) and were maintained therea»áer over long periods
of time. There is some evidence to suggest this hypothesis may be true,
such as the Cambrian explosion in the fossil record, the discovery of
cascading developmental genes, and the observation of large changes in
phenotypic expression caused by single base-pair mutations. The second,
the molecular clock hypothesis, is the notion that genetic mutations
occur in a genome at a linear rate. Assuming the molecular clo
