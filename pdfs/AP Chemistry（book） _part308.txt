 
scaled up in size (Figure 2.18). These models show the relative sizes of the atoms, 
but the angles between atoms, which help define their molecular geometry, are 
often more difficult to see than in ball-and-stick models. Because space-filling 
models give a good representation of the true size of a molecule, they are useful 
for picturing how two molecules might fit together or pack in the solid state. As with 
ball-and-stick models, the identities of the atoms are typically indicated by color.

(c) Can we infer from this drawing that the H—C—H bond angles are 90 degrees?
2.7 ∣ Ions and Ionic Compounds
If electrons are removed from or added to an atom, a charged particle called an ion is 
formed. An ion with a positive charge is a cation (pronounced CAT-ion); a negatively 
charged ion is an anion (AN-ion).
To see how ions form, c
