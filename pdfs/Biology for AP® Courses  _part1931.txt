 species, usually generated by molecular cloning techniques. Vaccines,
antibiotics, and hormones are examples of products obtained by recombinant DNA technology. Transgenic plants are
usually created to improve characteristics of crop plants.
17.2 Mapping Genomes
Genome mapping is similar to solving a big, complicated puzzle with pieces of information coming from laboratories all
over the world. Genetic maps provide an outline for the location of genes within a genome, and they estimate the distance
between genes and genetic markers on the basis of recombination frequencies during meiosis. Physical maps provide
detailed information about the physical distance between the genes. The most detailed information is available through
sequence mapping. Information from all mapping and sequencing sources is combined to study an entire genome.
17.3 Whole-Genome Sequencing
Whole-genome sequencing is the latest available resource to treat genetic diseases. Some doctors are using whole-genome
sequ
