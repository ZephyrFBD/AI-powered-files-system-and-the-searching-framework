at manufacture these enzymes to combat invading viruses. Restriction
enzymes are very specific, cutting DNA at specific recognition sequences of nucleotides called restriction sites
(Figure 9-8). The cut across a double-stranded DNA is usually staggered, producing fragments that have one strand
of the DNA extending beyond the complementary strand. The unpaired extension is called a sticky end.

DNA Cloning
DNA cloning is a procedure that allows DNA fragments or genes to be copied. The major features of the process
follow:
1. Use a restriction enzyme to cut up the foreign DNA that contains a gene to be copied. The restriction enzyme
produces multiple fragments of the foreign DNA with sticky ends. Some of these fragments will contain the gene to
be copied.
2. Use the same restriction enzyme to cut up the DNA of a cloning vector. A cloning vector is a vehicle used to
transfer DNA between cells. Plasmids are commonly used as vectors because they can subsequently be introduced
