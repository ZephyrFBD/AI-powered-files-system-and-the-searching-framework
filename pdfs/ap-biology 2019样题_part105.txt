 molecular events 
connect to overall function of organisms 
and to carbon transfer within ecosystems. 
Students should have an understanding 
of cellular respiration and photosynthesis 
to predict and justify the effect of 
environmental changes on those processes. 
Students may be required to graph data 
from an experiment—using the skills 
learned in Unit 2—and calculate reaction 
rates. Students are advised to show their 
calculations, ensuring that units are included 
in their final answer.
Developing Understanding
In Unit 3, students build on knowledge gained in Unit 2 about the structure and function of 
cells, focusing on cellular energetics. Living systems are complex in their organization and 
require constant energy input. This unit will provide students with the knowledge necessary to 
master the concepts of energy capture and use. Students work through enzyme structure and 
function, learning the ways in which the environment plays a role in how enzymes perform their
