l species at the different temperatures. 
 
 (Section 14.2) We can then calculate the equilibrium constant at each temperature. 
How do we explain why the equilibrium constants and therefore the position of equilib-
rium both depend on temperature?
We can deduce the rules for the relationship between K and temperature from Le 
Châtelier’s principle. We do this by treating heat as a chemical reagent. In an endother-
mic (heat-absorbing) reaction, we consider heat a reactant, and in an exothermic (heat- 
releasing) reaction, we consider heat a product:
 
Endothermic: 
Reactants + heat ∆ products
 
Exothermic:  
Reactants ∆ products + heat

CoCl42–
Solution appears violet because 
appreciable amounts of both pink 
Co(H2O)6
2+ and blue CoCl4
2– are 
present.
Solution appears pink because 
lowering the temperature shifts the 
equilibrium to favor formation of 
the pink Co(H2O)6
2+ ion.
Solution appears blue because
