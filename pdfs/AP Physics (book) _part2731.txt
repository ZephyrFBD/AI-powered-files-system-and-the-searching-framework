ffrac-
tion pattern?
(a) There is a path length difference from waves originating
at different parts of the slit.
(b) The wavelength of the light is shorter than the slit.
(c) The light passing through the slit interferes with light
that does not pass through.
(d) The single slit must have something in the middle of it,
causing it to act like a double slit.
5. If you hold two fingers very close together and look at a bright
light, you see lines between the fingers. What is happening?
(a) You are holding your fingers too close to your eye to
be able to focus on it.
(b) You are seeing a diffraction pattern.
(c) This is a quantum-mechanical tunneling effect.
(d) The brightness of the light is overwhelming your eye.
6. Light passes through a slit that is about 
high and
wide. The central bright light visible on a
distant screen will be
(a) about 
high and about 
wide.
(b) about 
high and wider than 
(c) about 
high and narrower than 
(d) taller than 
high and wider than 
(e) taller than
