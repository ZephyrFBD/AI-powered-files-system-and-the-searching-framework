ined with RuBP do not lead to the production of
useful, energy-rich molecules like glucose. Instead, specialized cellular organelles, the peroxisomes, are found near
chloroplasts, where they function to break down photorespiration products. Thus, considerable effort is made by
plants to rid the cell of the products of photorespiration. Since the early atmosphere in which primitive plants
originated contained very little oxygen, it is hypothesized that the early evolution of rubisco was not
influenced by its O2-fixing handicap.
Capturing Free Energy without Light
Organisms that use sunlight as a source of free energy to drive photosynthesis and to produce carbohydrates are
called photoautotrophs. Some prokaryotes, called chemoautotrophs (or chemolithoautotrophs), are able to use
inorganic substances as a source of energy to generate organic molecules. This process, generally referred to as
chemosynthesis,
uses H2S (hydrogen sulfide), NH3 (ammonia), or NO2âˆ’ (nitrite) as a source
 
of fre
