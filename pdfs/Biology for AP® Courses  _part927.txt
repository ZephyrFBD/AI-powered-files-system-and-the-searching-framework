Photosynthesis consists of two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions or Calvin cycle.
The light-dependent reactions occur when light is available. The overall equation for photosynthesis shows that is it a redox
reaction; carbon dioxide is reduced and water is oxidized to produce oxygen:
Energy + 6CO2  + H2 O  → C6 H12 O6  + 6O2
The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, whereas the Calvin cycle occurs in the
stroma of chloroplasts. Embedded in the thylakoid membranes are two photosystems (PS I and PS II), which are complexes
of pigments that capture solar energy. Chlorophylls a and b absorb violet, blue, and red wavelengths f
