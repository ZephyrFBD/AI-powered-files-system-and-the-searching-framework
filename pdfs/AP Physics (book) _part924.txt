4. For the torque equation,
choose any axis perpendicular to the xy plane that
might make the calculation easier. (For example, you
can reduce the number of unknowns in the resulting
equation by choosing the axis so that one of the
unknown forces acts through that axis; then this force
will have zero lever arm and produce zero torque, and
so wonâ€™t appear in the torque equation.) Pay careful
attention to determining the lever arm for each force
correctly. Give each torque a 
or 
sign to indicate
torque direction. For example, if torques tending
to rotate the object counterclockwise are positive,
then those tending to rotate it clockwise are negative.
