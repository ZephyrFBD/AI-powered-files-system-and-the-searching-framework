lt of the perchlorate ion 
(ClO4
-). Like MnO4
-, ClO4
- is tetrahedral and has its central atom in 
the +7 oxidation state. However, because the Cl atom does not have 
low-lying d orbitals, exciting an electron from O to Cl requires a more 
energetic photon than does it does in MnO4
-. The Ô¨Årst absorption for 
ClO4
- is in the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum, so no visible light 
is absorbed and the salt appears white.
Other complexes exhibit charge-transfer excitations in which 
an electron from the metal atom is excited to an empty orbital on a 
ligand. Such an excitation is called a metal-to-ligand charge-transfer 
(MLCT) transition.
Charge-transfer transitions are generally more intense than d-d 
transitions. Many metal-containing pigments used for oil paint-
ing, such as cadmium yellow (CdS), chrome yellow (PbCrO4), and 
red ochre (Fe2O3), have intense colors because of charge-transfer 
 
transitions.
