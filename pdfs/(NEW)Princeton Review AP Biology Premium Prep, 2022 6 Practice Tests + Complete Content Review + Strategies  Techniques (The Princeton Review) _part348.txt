the control of a single
promoter; these functioning units of DNA are called operons. One of the best-understood operons is the lac operon,
which controls expression of the enzymes that break down (catabolize) lactose.
The operon consists of four major parts: structural genes, promoter genes, the operator, and the regulatory gene:
Structural genes code for enzymes needed in a chemical reaction. These genes will be transcribed at the same
time to produce particular enzymes. In the lac operon, three enzymes (beta galactosidase, galactose permease,
and thiogalactoside transacetylase) involved in digesting lactose are coded for.
The promoter gene is the region where the RNA polymerase binds to begin transcription.
The operator is a region that controls whether transcription will occur; this is where the repressor binds.
The regulatory gene codes for a specific regulatory protein called the repressor. The repressor is capable of
attaching to the operator and blocking transcription. If the re
