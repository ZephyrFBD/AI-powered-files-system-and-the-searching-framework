k many kinds of single chemical bonds. Thus, the “ozone shield” is essential for 
our continued well-being. The ozone molecules that form this essential shield against 
high-energy radiation represent only a tiny fraction of the oxygen atoms present in the 
stratosphere, however, because these molecules are continually destroyed even as they 
are formed.

Human Activities  
and Earth’s Atmosphere
Both natural and anthropogenic (human-caused) events can modify Earth’s atmo-
sphere. One impressive natural event was the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 
(Figure 18.6). The volcano ejected approximately 10 km3 of material into the strato-
sphere, causing a 10% drop in the amount of sunlight reaching Earth’s surface during 
the next 2 years. That drop in sunlight led to a temporary 0.5 °C drop in Earth’s surface 
temperature. The volcanic particles that made it to the stratosphere remained there for 
approximately 3 years, raising the temperature of the stratosphere by several
