p, ruling out (C) and (D). In
Experiment 2, the addition of protein Y by itself does not change protein X
levels, while in Experiment 3, the addition of protein Y with protein X
prevents an increase in protein X levels over time, indicating protein Y is
most likely inhibiting rather than promoting the transcription of the X
operon. This observation is the opposite of (B), but matches (A).
24. C
Adding lactose to E. coli cells increases protein Y levels, suggesting lactose
is increasing the transcription of the Y operon. Inhibiting RNA polymerase
from binding to the promoter would instead decrease transcription, ruling
out (D). Experiments 1, 2, and 3 also show that protein X does not aï¬€ect
protein Y levels, so even if lactose did decrease transcription of the X
operon, protein Y levels would not change, eliminating (B). Inducers
increase gene expression by binding to and disabling repressors, which
matches (C). While enhancers also increase transcription, they are DNA
sequences, not di
