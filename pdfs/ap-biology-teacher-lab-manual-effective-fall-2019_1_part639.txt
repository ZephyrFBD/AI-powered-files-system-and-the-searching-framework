 highly complex organization of living systems requires constant input of 
energy and the exchange of macromolecules. 
•  SYI-3: Naturally occurring diversity among and between components within  
biological systems affects interactions with the environment.  
■ Learning Objectives 
•  ENE-1.M: Describe the strategies organisms use to acquire and use energy.  
•  ENE-1.N: Explain how changes in energy availability affect populations and  
ecosystems.   
•  ENE-1.O: Explain how the activities of autotrophs and heterotrophs enable the flow of 
energy within an ecosystem. 
•  SYI-3.A: Explain the connection between variation in the number and types of 
molecules within cells to the ability of the organism to survive and/or reproduce in 
different environments. 
■ Science Skills 
•  6.C: Provide reasoning to justify a claim by connecting evidence to biological theories. 
•  6.D: Explain the relationship between experimental results and larger biological 
concepts, processes, or theories
