 implying that there is little evidence supporting it and that it is still in the process of being rigorously tested. This
is a mischaracterization.
Individuals Evolve
Evolution is the change in genetic composition of a population over time, specifically over generations, resulting from
differential reproduction of individuals with certain alleles. Individuals do change over their lifetime, obviously, but this is
called development and involves changes programmed by the set of genes the individual acquired at birth in coordination
with the individual’s environment. When thinking about the evolution of a characteristic, it is probably best to think about
the change of the average value of the characteristic in the population over time. For example, when natural selection leads
to bill-size change in medium-ground finches in the Galápagos, this does not mean that individual bills on the finches are
