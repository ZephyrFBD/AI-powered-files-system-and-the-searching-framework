 10.19  The typical atmospheric pressure on top of Mount Everest 
 
129,028 ft2 is about 265 torr. Convert this pressure to (a) atm, 
(b) mm Hg, (c) pascals, (d) bars, (e) psi.
 10.20  Perform the following conversions: (a) 0.912 atm to torr, 
 
(b) 0.685 bar to kilopascals, (c) 655 mm Hg to atmospheres, 
(d) 1.323 * 105 Pa to atmospheres, (e) 2.50 atm to psi.
 10.21  In the United States, barometric pressures are generally reported 
in inches of mercury (in. Hg). On a beautiful summer day in 
Chicago, the barometric pressure is 30.45 in. Hg. (a) Convert 
this pressure to torr. (b) Convert this pressure to atm.
 10.22  Hurricane Wilma of 2005 is the most intense hurricane on 
record in the Atlantic basin, with a low-pressure reading of 
882 mbar (millibars). Convert this reading into (a) atmo-
spheres, (b) torr, and (c) inches of Hg.
