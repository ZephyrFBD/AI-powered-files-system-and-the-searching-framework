 produces a
response, and once the response reaches a certain level, it sends a signal that stops additional release of the hormone. In
this way, the concentration of hormones in blood is maintained within a narrow range. For example, the anterior pituitary
stimulates the thyroid gland to release thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Increased levels of these hormones result in feedback
to the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit further signaling to the thyroid gland.
Some hormones are regulated by positive feedback in which the response is amplified; an example of hormone regulation
by positive feedback is the production of oxytocin during labor and childbirth as uterine contractions cause the production
and release of more oxytocin. Disruptions in the mechanisms of feedback often result in deleterious consequences, such as
diabetes mellitus resulting in decreased insulin production.
