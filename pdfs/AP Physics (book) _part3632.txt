electron clouds are distributed
preferentially along the lines (bonds) joining the atoms in the crystal. In a similar
way, at 
the force between elementary particles is theorized to be a single
force—it is symmetrical and does not single out one type of “charge” over
another. But at larger distances, that symmetry is broken and we see three dis-
tinct forces. (In the “Standard Model” of electroweak interactions, Section 32–10,
the symmetry breaking between the electromagnetic and the weak interactions
occurs at about 
)
Symmetry. The table in Fig. 32–21 has
four identical place settings. Four people sit down to eat. Describe the symmetry
of this table and what happens to it when someone starts the meal.
RESPONSE The table has several kinds of symmetry. It is symmetric to
rotations of 90°: that is, the table will look the same if everyone moved one
chair to the left or to the right. It is also north–south symmetric and east–west
symmetric, so that swaps across the table don’t affect the
