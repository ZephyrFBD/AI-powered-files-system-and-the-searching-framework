ng prometaphase, mitotic spindle microtubules from opposite poles attach to each sister chromatid at
the kinetochore. In anaphase, the connection between the sister chromatids breaks down, and the microtubules pull
the chromosomes toward opposite poles.
During metaphase, the “change phase,” all the chromosomes are aligned in a plane called the metaphase plate, or the
equatorial plane, midway between the two poles of the cell. The sister chromatids are still tightly attached to each other by
cohesin proteins. At this time, the chromosomes are maximally condensed.
During anaphase, the “upward phase,” the cohesin proteins degrade, and the sister chromatids separate at the centromere.
Each chromatid, now called a chromosome, is pulled rapidly toward the centrosome to which its microtubule is attached.
The cell becomes visibly elongated (oval shaped) as the polar microtubules slide against each other at the metaphase plate
where they overlap.
During telophase, the “distance phase,” the chro
