for human use begins. In the United States, drug approval is
handled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and involves a series of large-scale experiments using
human subjects to make sure the drug is not harmful and effectively treats the condition it aims to treat. This
process often takes several years and requires the participation of physicians and scientists, in addition to
chemists, to complete testing and gain approval.
An example of a drug that was originally discovered in a living organism is Paclitaxel, an anti-cancer drug.
This drug was discovered in the bark of the pacific yew tree. Another example is aspirin, originally isolated
from willow tree bark. Finding drugs often means testing hundreds of samples of plants, fungi, and other
forms of life to see if any biologically active compounds are found within them. Sometimes, traditional
medicine can give modern medicine clues to where an active compound can be found. For example, the
use of willow bark to make medicine
