1? (b) What is the empirical 
formula for Compound 2?  Upon determining the melting 
points of these two compounds, you find that the yellow 
compound melts at 25 °C, while the black powder does not 
melt up to the maximum temperature of your apparatus, 
1200 °C. (c) What is the identity of the yellow compound? 
(d) What is the identity of the black compound? (e) Which 
compound is molecular? (f) Which compound is ionic?
 8.102 One scale for electronegativity is based on the concept that 
the electronegativity of any atom is proportional to the 
ionization energy of the atom minus its electron affinity: 
electronegativity = k1I - EA2, where k is a proportionality 
constant. (a) How does this definition explain why the elec-
tronegativity of F is greater than that of Cl, even though Cl 
has the greater electron affinity? (b) Why are both ioniza-
tion energy and electron affinity relevant to the notion of 
electronegativity? (c) By using data in Chapter 7, determine 
the value of k that
