ation that possesses the neces-
sary energy to break the bond? What type of electromagnetic 
radiation is this?
 6.31  A diode laser emits at a wavelength of 987 nm. (a) In what por-
tion of the electromagnetic spectrum is this radiation found? 
(b) All of its output energy is absorbed in a detector that mea-
sures a total energy of 0.52 J over a period of 32 s. How many 
photons per second are being emitted by the laser?
 6.32  A stellar object is emitting radiation at 3.55 mm. (a) What 
type of electromagnetic spectrum is this radiation? (b) If a 
detector is capturing 3.2 * 108 photons per second at this 
wavelength, what is the total energy of the photons detected 
in 1.0 hour?
 6.33  Molybdenum metal must absorb radiation with a minimum 
frequency of 1.09 * 1015 s - 1 before it can eject an electron 
from its surface via the photoelectric effect. (a) What is the 
minimum energy needed to eject an electron? (b) What 
wavelength of radiation will provide a photon of this energy?
