gs are
replaced by split-ring commutators, Fig. 21–15a, just as in a dc motor (Figs. 20–37
and 20–38). The output of such a generator is as shown and can be smoothed out
by placing a capacitor in parallel with the output.† More common is the use of
many armature windings, as in Fig. 21–15b, which produces a smoother output.

†A capacitor tends to store charge and, if the time constant RC
is long enough, helps to smooth out the voltage as shown in 
the figure to the right.

Alternators
Automobiles used to use dc generators. Today they mainly use alternators, which
avoid the problems of wear and electrical arcing (sparks) across the split-ring
commutators of dc generators. Alternators differ from
