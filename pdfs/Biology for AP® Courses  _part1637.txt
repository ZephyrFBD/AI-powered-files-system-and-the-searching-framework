Prokaryotic Promoters
A promoter is a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription. In most cases,
promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate. The specific sequence of a promoter is very important because
it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all the time, some of the time, or infrequently. Although
promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes, a few elements are conserved. At the -10 and -35 regions upstream of the
initiation site, there are two promoter consensus sequences, or regions that are similar across all promoters and across
various bacterial species (Figure 15.7). The -10 consensus sequence, called the -10 region, is TATAAT. The -35 sequence,
TTGACA, is recognized and bound by σ. Once this interaction is made, the subunits of the core enzyme bind to the site.
The A–T-rich -10 region facilitates unwinding of the DNA template, and several phosphodiester bonds are made. The
tran
