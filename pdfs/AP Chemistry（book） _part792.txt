l value, or caloric content, of the food we ingest 
exceeds the energy we expend, our body stores the surplus as fat.
Give It Some Thought
Which releases the greatest amount of energy per gram when metabolized? 
Carbohydrates, proteins, or fats.
Fuels
During the complete combustion of fuels, carbon is converted to CO2 and hydrogen is 
converted to H2O, both of which have large negative enthalpies of formation. Conse-
quently, the greater the percentage of carbon and hydrogen in a fuel, the higher its fuel 
value. In Table 5.6, for example, compare the compositions and fuel values of bituminous 
coal and wood. The coal has a higher fuel value because of its greater carbon content.
In 2013 the United States consumed 1.02 * 1017 kJ of energy. This value corresponds to 
an average daily energy consumption per person of 9.3 *  
105 kJ, roughly 100 times greater 
than the per capita food-energy needs. Figure 5.26 illustrates the sources of this energy.
Coal, petroleum, and natural gas, which
