Developing Understanding
Unit 5 focuses on heredity and the biological concepts and processes involved in ensuring the 
continuity of life. Students learn that the storage and transmission of genetic information via 
chromosomes from one generation to the next occur through meiosis. Meiotic division ensures 
genetic diversity, which is crucial to the survival of a species. In this unit, students gain a deeper 
understanding of Mendelian genetics and learning how non-Mendelian genetics describes 
those patterns of inheritance that seem to violate Mendel’s laws. This unit also teaches the role 
played by chromosomal inheritance, environmental factors, and nondisjunction on an individual’s 
phenotype. In Unit 6, students move on to learn about gene expression and regulation.
