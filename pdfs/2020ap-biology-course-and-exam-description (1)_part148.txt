Data can convey important information about 
biological systems. In order to understand 
that information, students need to practice 
describing data and then identifying and 
describing the patterns and trends that might 
make the data meaningful for the researcher 
and possibly lead to the discovery of new 
information or the development of new 
concepts. Comparing patterns and trends 
in data helps students describe biological 
changes that occur over time, predict 
short-term and long-term changes, and 
draw conclusions about the causes and/or 
solutions to problems in biological systems.
Students should understand the value and 
application of the chi-square test in additional 
contexts beyond genetics. Students should 
learn the difference between null and 
alternate hypotheses
