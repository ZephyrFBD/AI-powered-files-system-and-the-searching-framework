 chapter, as well as 
in most other undergraduate-level chemistry texts. In reality, however, there is a continuum 
between the extremes of ionic and covalent bonding. This lack of a well-defined separation 
between the two types of bonding may seem unsettling or confusing at first.
The simple models of ionic and covalent bonding presented in this chapter go a long 
way toward understanding and predicting the structures and properties of chemical com-
pounds. When covalent bonding is dominant, we expect compounds to exist as mole-
cules,* having all the properties we associate with molecular substances, such as relatively 
low melting and boiling points and nonelectrolyte behavior when dissolved in water. When 
ionic bonding is dominant, we expect the compounds to be brittle, high-melting solids with 
extended lattice structures, exhibiting strong electrolyte behavior when dissolved in water.
Naturally, there are exceptions to these general characterizations, some of which 
we examine
