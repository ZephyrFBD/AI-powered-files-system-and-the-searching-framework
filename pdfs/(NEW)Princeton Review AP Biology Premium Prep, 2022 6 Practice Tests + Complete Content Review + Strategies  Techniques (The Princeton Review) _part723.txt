ince Cornwall sharks show an increase in
jump height compared to Isle of Man, we could predict that the Cornwall site had a higher temperature compared to the
Isle of Man site.
Question 3
a. Describe how photosynthesis is different from the energy-producing reactions of aerobic respiration.
Photosynthesis takes sunlight and water and carbon dioxide and produces sugar and oxygen. Cell respiration
requires sugar and oxygen to make ATP and carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis gathers energy from sunlight.
Cell respiration makes energy as ATP. The end products of photosynthesis get used as reactants in aerobic
respiration.
b. Identify the hypothesis the researcher was testing.
The researcherâ€™s hypothesis was that a hexachloroplatinate composite made from chloroplasts and
hexachloroplatinate ions would be photosynthetic.
c. Predict how the dark phases of photosynthesis were affected during this experiment.
The dark phases would be active.
d. Justify your prediction.
They would be active
