olve this problem. The probability of having a boy and then a
girl is 12×12=14. The probability of having a girl and then a boy is
12×12=14. Therefore, the probability of having one boy and one girl (in
either order) is 14×14=12.
LAW OF DOMINANCE
Mendel’s first law is the law of dominance, which states that when two
organisms, each homozygous (pure) for two opposing traits are crossed,
the offspring will be hybrid (carry two different alleles) but will exhibit
only the dominant trait. The trait that remains hidden is known as the
recessive trait.
LAW OF SEGREGATION
The law of segregation states that during the formation of gametes, the
two traits carried by each parent separate. See Figure 8.1.
SYI-3
Segregation and independent assortment of chromosomes result in genetic variation.

The cross that best exemplifies this law is the monohybrid cross, Tt × Tt.
In the monohybrid cross, a trait that was not evident in
