vision of the cytoplasm to form
two new cells, each with one nucleus. Together, they occur during the M phase of the cell cycle.
Mitosis
There are four phases in mitosis (adjective, mitotic): prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase (Figure 7-3).
Cytokinesis begins during telophase.
The AP exam does not require you to use the names of the phases of the cell cycle (prophase, metaphase, anaphase,
telophase) in your responses. You would receive an equal amount of credit for your response if you omitted these
words and only described the events of mitosis in the correct sequence of occurrence. However, the names of the
phases are universally found in biology textbooks and are used here to provide you with the terminology that you
will find in your textbook. In the following descriptions, a word in parentheses highlights what happens in each
phase:
1. In prophase (condensation), three activities occur simultaneously. First, the nucleoli disappear and the chromatin
condenses into chromos
