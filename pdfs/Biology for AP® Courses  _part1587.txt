yotes have multiple sites of origin and use
fourteen polymerases. Telomerase is absent in
prokaryotes. DNA pol I is the primer remover in
eukaryotes, while in prokaryotes it is RNase H.
DNA pol III performs strand elongation in
prokaryotes and pol δ and pol ε do the same
in eukaryotes.
50. What would be the consequence of a mutation in a
mismatch repair enzyme? How will this affect the function
of a gene?
a.
Mismatch repair corrects the errors after the
replication is completed by excising the
incorrectly added nucleotide and adding the
correct base. Any mutation in a mismatch repair
enzyme would lead to more permanent damage.
b.
Mismatch repair corrects the errors during the
replication by excising the incorrectly added
nucleotide and adding the correct base. Any
mutation in the mismatch repair enzyme would
lead to more permanent damage.
c.
Mismatch repair corrects the errors after the
replication is completed by excising the added
nucleotides and adding more bases. Any
