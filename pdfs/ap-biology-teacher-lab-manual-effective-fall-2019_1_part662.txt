y from plants to cabbage white butterfly larvae (the consumers) as the larvae eat 
cabbage-family plants.
The following exercises describe skills and methods for estimating energy flow in 
a terrestrial ecosystem. Note and record any questions that occur to you as you work 
through this activity.
Questions might include the following:
Bullet What kinds of things affect plant productivity, the growth of cabbage white butterfly 
larvae, or the interactions of these organisms? 
Bullet How do you keep track of energy as it moves through the biological system? Can the 
techniques used for tracking energy be improved?
Bullet What is the role of energy in ecosystems?
