o has the trait will be carriers for the trait
(unless they also receive an aﬀected X from their mother as well, in
which case they will express the trait).
There is no male-to-male transmission.
All sons of an aﬀected female will have the trait, while all daughters of
an aﬀected female will be carriers (unless they received an aﬀected X
from their father as well, in which case they will express the trait).
Non-Mendelian Inheritance
Mendelian genetics, however, does not apply to all genes. Inheritance
patterns that do not follow Mendelian laws fall under non-Mendelian
inheritance. For instance, genes may be linked to other genes on the
same chromosome. Thus, the linked genes may not sort independently
and may be inherited together. If linked genes are far apart on the
chromosome, crossing over (exchange of genes between homologous
chromosomes) during meiosis may separate them. The farther away
genes are from each other, the more likely they are to be separated as a
result of crossing o
