t), the five
bones of the metacarpus (palm), and the 14 bones of the phalanges (digits). Each digit consists of three phalanges, except
for the thumb, when present, which has only two.
The Pelvic Girdle
The pelvic girdle attaches to the lower limbs of the axial skeleton. Because it is responsible for bearing the weight of the
body and for locomotion, the pelvic girdle is securely attached to the axial skeleton by strong ligaments. It also has deep
sockets with robust ligaments to securely attach the femur to the body. The pelvic girdle is further strengthened by two large
hip bones. In adults, the hip bones, or coxal bones, are formed by the fusion of three pairs of bones: the ilium, ischium, and
pubis. The pelvis joins together in the anterior of the body at a joint called the pubic symphysis and with the bones of the
sacrum at the posterior of the body.
The female pelvis is slightly different from the male pelvis. Over generations of evolution, females with a wider pubic
angle and la
