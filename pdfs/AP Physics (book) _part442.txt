Problem 73.
74. Bob traverses a chasm by stringing a rope between a tree
on one side of the chasm and a tree on the opposite side,
25 m away, Fig. 4–65. Assume the rope can provide a 
tension force of up to 29 kN before breaking, and use a
“safety factor” of 10 (that is, the rope should only be
required to undergo a tension force of 2.9 kN). (a) If Bob’s
mass is 72.0 kg, determine the distance x that the rope
must sag at a point halfway across if it is to be within its
recommended safety range. (b) If the rope sags by only one-
fourth the distance found in (a), determine the tension
force in the rope. Will the rope break?
