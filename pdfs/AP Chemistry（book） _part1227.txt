The arrow indicates the transfer of an electron from the Na atom to the Cl atom. Each 
ion has an octet of electrons, the Na+ octet being the 2s22p6 electrons that lie below the 
single 3s valence electron of the Na atom. We have put a bracket around the chloride ion 
to emphasize that all eight electrons are located on it.
