Adding Electric Forces; Principle of Superposition
When dealing with several charges, it is helpful to use double subscripts on each
of the forces involved. The first subscript refers to the particle on which the force
acts; the second refers to the particle that exerts the force. For example, if we
have three charges,
means the force exerted on particle 3 by particle 1.

As in all problem solving, it is very important to draw a diagram, in particular
a free-body diagram (Chapter 4) for each object, showing all the forces acting on
