CHAPTER 17
Electric Potential
1. If two points are at the same potential, does this mean that
no net work is done in moving a test charge from one point to
the other? Does this imply that no force must be exerted?
Explain.
2. If a negative charge is initially at rest in an electric field,
will it move toward a region of higher potential or lower
potential? What about a positive charge? How does the
potential energy of the charge change in each instance?
Explain.
3. State clearly the difference (a) between electric potential
and electric field, (b) between electric potential and elec-
tric potential energy.
4. An electron is accelerated from rest by a potential differ-
ence of 0.20 V. How much greater would its final speed 
be if it is accelerated with four times as much voltage?
Explain.
5. Is there a point along the line joining two equal positive
charges where the electric field is zero? Where the electric
potential i
