repeated
exposure. This is a form of non-associative learning, as the stimulus is not associated with any punishment or reward.
Prairie dogs typically sound an alarm call when threatened by a predator, but they become habituated to the sound of human
footsteps when no harm is associated with this sound, therefore, they no longer respond to them with an alarm call. In this
example, habituation is specific to the sound of human footsteps, as the animals still respond to the sounds of potential
predators.
Imprinting
Imprinting is a type of learning that occurs at a particular age or a life stage that is rapid and independent of the species
involved. Hatchling ducks recognize the first adult they see, their mother, and make a bond with her. A familiar sight is
ducklings walking or swimming after their mothers (Figure 36.40). This is another type of non-associative learning, but
is very important in the maturation process of these animals as it encourages them to stay near their mother so t
