Referring to Example 4–21, show that if a skier moves at
constant speed straight down a slope of angle , then the
coefficient of kinetic friction between skis and snow is
mk = tan u.

97. An 18-kg child is riding in a
child-restraint chair, securely
fastened to the seat of a car
(Fig. 4–77). Assume the car
has speed 
when it hits
a tree and is brought to rest 
in 0.20 s. Assuming constant
deceleration during the colli-
sion, estimate the net horizontal
force F that the straps of the
restraint chair exert on the child
to hold her in the chair.
