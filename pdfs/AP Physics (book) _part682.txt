 cubic meters of water will
have to be pumped from the lower to the upper reservoir?
Assume the upper reservoir is an average of 380 m above
the lower one. Water has a mass of

By the time it reaches the plate, it may have
slowed by 10%. Neglecting gravity, estimate the average
force of air resistance during a pitch. The distance between
the plate and the pitcher is about 15 m.

1. We studied forces earlier and used them to solve Problems.
Now we are using energy to solve Problems, even some that
could be solved with forces. (a) Give at least three advan-
tages of using energy to solve a Problem. (b) When must
you use energy to solve a Problem? (c) When must you use
forces to solve a Problem? (d) What information is not
available when solving Problems with energy? Look at the
Examples in Chapters 6 and 4.
