7. (III) Electrons are accelerated by 6.0 kV in a CRT. The screen
is 30 cm wide and is 34 cm from the 2.6-cm-long deflection
plates. Over what range must the horizontally deflecting
electric field vary to sweep the beam fully across the screen?

77. A 
and a 
charge are placed 2.5 cm apart. At
what points along the line joining them is (a) the electric
field zero, and (b) the electric potential zero?
78. Near the surface of the Earth there is an electric field of
about 150
which points downward. Two identical balls
with mass 
are dropped from a height of 2.00 m,
but one of the balls is positively charged with 
and the second is negatively charged with
