 reaction. Assuming that the 
drug that binds more strongly will be more effective, which 
drug is the better choice for further research?
Applications of Equilibrium Constants  
(section 15.6)
 15.41 (a) If Q c 6 Kc, in which direction will a reaction proceed 
in order to reach equilibrium? (b) What condition must 
be satisfied so that Q c = Kc?
 15.42 (a) If Q c 7 Kc, how must the reaction proceed to reach 
equilibrium? (b) At the start of a certain reaction, only 
reactants are present; no products have been formed. 
What is the value of Q c at this point in the reaction?
 15.43 At 100 °C, the equilibrium constant for the reaction 
COCl21g2 ∆ CO1g2 + Cl21g2 has the value Kc =
2.19 * 10-10. Are the following mixtures of COCl2, CO, 
and Cl2 at 100 °C at equilibrium? If not, indicate the direc-
tion that the reaction must proceed to achieve equilibrium.
(a) 3COCl24 = 2.00 * 10-3 M, 3CO4 = 3.3 * 10-6 M,
 3Cl24 = 6.62 * 10-6 M
(b) 3COCl24 = 4.50 * 10-2 M, 3CO4 = 1.1 * 10-7 M, 
3Cl24 = 2.
