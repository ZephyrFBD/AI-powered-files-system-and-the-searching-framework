yleigh criterion states that two images are just resolvable when
the center of the diffraction disk of one image is directly over the first minimum in
the diffraction pattern of the other. This is shown in Fig. 25–31. Since the first
minimum is at an angle
from the central maximum, Fig. 25–31
shows that two objects can be considered just resolvable if they are separated by
at least an angle given by
(25;7)
In this equation, D is the diameter of the lens, and applies also to a mirror
diameter. This is the limit on resolution set by the wave nature of light due to
diffraction. A smaller angle means better resolution: you can make out closer
objects. We see from Eq. 25–7 that using a shorter wavelength can reduce and
thus increase resolution.
