1. Five equally sized cubes of turnips are massed and placed in five different sucrose solutions at 21°C. The turnip
cubes are massed again after 24 hours, and the percent change in mass is calculated. A graph of the data is
constructed.
(a) Explain the percent change in mass for each of the cubes tested.
(b) Analyze the graph and predict the molarity of a turnip cell, giving evidence to support your claim.
(c) Calculate the solute potential of a turnip cell.
(d) A new turnip cube is placed in a 0.5 M solution. Predict the percent change in mass of the turnip cube
after 24 hours. Justify your prediction.
2. Transpiration rate was measured for three different plant species. Ten plants of each species were kept under
the same experimental conditions for three days. Total water loss for each plant was me
