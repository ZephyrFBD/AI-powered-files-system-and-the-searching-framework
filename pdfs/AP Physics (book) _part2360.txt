it and sent to its own solenoid circuit breaker that opens the circuit at the
switch S, thus protecting your life.
If the case of the faulty device is grounded, the difference in current is even
higher when there is a fault, and the GFCI trips very quickly.
GFCIs can sense current differences as low as 5 mA and react in 1 ms, saving
lives. They can be small to fit as a wall outlet (Fig. 21–34a), or as a plug-in unit
into which you plug a hair dryer or toaster (Fig.21–34b).It is especially important to
have GFCIs installed in kitchens, in bathrooms, outdoors, and near swimming pools,
where people are most in danger of touching ground. GFCIs always have a “test”
button (to be sure the GFCI itself works) and a “reset” button (after it goes off).
