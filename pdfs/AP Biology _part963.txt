This model demonstrates how a signal that is sent to a cell
triggers a response from the cell. This process consists of three
parts: reception, transduction, and response. It is a major way in
which cells communicate. It exists in cells across every
kingdom and controls a myriad of cellular processes, like the
initiation of apoptosis or the release of hormones. One version
of this process is the signal transduction pathway.
This complex process relies on the interaction of many
molecules that must bind to each other in specific ways. The
three shapes at “L” in the model (called ligands) represent
hundreds of molecules that send a signal. At the area labeled
“I” on the model, you see that only one specially shaped ligand
can bind to the receptor on the membrane surface. This binding
triggers a chain reaction in the transducers, or relay molecules,
at the area labeled
