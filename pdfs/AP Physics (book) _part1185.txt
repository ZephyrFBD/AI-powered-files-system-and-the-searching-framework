 if you take a picture of the wave in
space at a given instant of time, the wave will have the shape of a sine or cosine as
a function of position. (2) In time: if you look at the motion of the medium at one
place over a long period of time—for example, if you look between two closely
spaced posts of a pier or out of a ship’s porthole as water waves pass by—the
up-and-down motion of that small segment of water will be simple harmonic
motion. The water moves up and down sinusoidally in time.
Some of the important quantities used to describe a periodic sinusoidal wave
are shown in Fig. 11–24. The high points on a wave are called crests; the low points,
troughs. The amplitude, A, is the maximum height of a crest, or depth of a trough,
relative to the normal (or equilibrium) level. The total swing from a crest to a trough
is 2A (twice the amplitude). The distance between two successive crests is the
wavelength,
(the Greek letter lambda). The wavelength is also equal to the dis-
tance betwe
