To better appreciate the amount of labor and ingenuity that went into Mendel’s experiments, proceed through one of
Mendel’s dihybrid crosses.
Question: What will be the offspring of a dihybrid cross?
Background: Consider that pea plants mature in one growing season, and you have access to a large garden in
which you can cultivate thousands of pea plants. There are several true-breeding plants with the following pairs of

traits: tall plants with inflated pods, and dwarf plants with constricted pods. Before the plants have matured, you
remove the pollen-producing organs from the tall/inflated plants in your crosses to prevent self-fertilization. Upon plant
maturation, the plants are manually crossed by transferring pollen from the dwarf/constricted plants to the stigmata of
the tall/inflated plants.
Hypothesis: Both trait pairs will sort independently accor
