Many low-molecular-weight amines have a fishy odor. Amines and NH3 
are produced by the anaerobic (absence of O2) decomposition of dead 
animal or plant matter. Two such amines with very disagreeable aromas 
are H2N1CH224NH2, putrescine, and H2N1CH225NH2, cadaverine. The 
names of these substances are testaments to their repugnant odors!
Many drugs, including quinine, codeine, caffeine, and amphet-
amine, are amines. Like o
