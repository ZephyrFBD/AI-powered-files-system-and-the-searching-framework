A self-cross of one of the Yy heterozygous offspring can be represented in a 2 × 2 Punnett square because each parent
can donate one of two different alleles. Therefore, the offspring can potentially have one of four allele combinations: YY,
Yy, yY, or yy (Figure 12.4). Notice that there are two ways to obtain the Yy genotype: a Y from the egg and a y from the
sperm, or a y from the egg and a Y from the sperm. Both of these possibilities must be counted. Recall that Mendel’s pea-
plant characteristics behaved in the same way in reciprocal crosses. Therefore, the two possible heterozygous combinations
produce offspring that are genotypically and phenotypically identical despite their dominant and recessive alleles deriving

be equally lik
