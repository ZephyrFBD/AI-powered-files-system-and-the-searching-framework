75. Two equal-mass stars maintain a constant distance apart 
of 
and revolve about a point midway between
them at a rate of one revolution every 12.6 yr. (a) Why
don’t the two stars crash into one another due to the 
gravitational force between them? (b) What must be the
mass of each star?
76. How far above the Earth’s surface will the acceleration of
gravity be half what it is at the surface?
77. Is it possible to whirl a bucket of water fast enough in a
vertical circle so that the water won’t fall out? If so, what 
is the minimum speed? Define all quantities needed.
78. How long would a day be if the Earth were rotating so fast
that objects at the equator were apparently weightless?
79. The rings of Saturn are composed of chunks of ice that
orbit the planet. The inner radius of the rings is 73,000 km,
and the outer radius is 170,000 km. Find the period of an
orbiting chunk of ice at the inner radius and the period of 
a chunk at the outer radius. Compare your numbers with
