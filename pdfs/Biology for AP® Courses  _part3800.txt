ace. The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule. Internally, the kidney has three regions—an outer cortex, a
medulla in the middle, and the renal pelvis in the region called the hilum of the kidney. The hilum is the concave part of
the bean-shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney; it is also the point of exit for the ureters. The renal
cortex is granular due to the presence of nephrons—the functional unit of the kidney. The medulla consists of multiple
pyramidal tissue masses, called the renal pyramids. In between the pyramids are spaces called renal columns through
which the blood vessels pass. The tips of the pyramids, called renal papillae, point toward the renal pelvis. There are, on
average, eight renal pyramids in each kidney. The renal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the
lobes of the kidney. The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney. On the inside of the kidney, the renal
pelvis branches out into
