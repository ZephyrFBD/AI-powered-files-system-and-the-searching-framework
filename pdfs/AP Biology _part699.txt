NERVOUS SYSTEM
The vertebrate nervous system consists of central and peripheral
components.
THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) consists of the brain and spinal
cord.
THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (PNS) consists of all nerves outside
the CNS.
The peripheral nervous system is then further divided and subdivided
into various systems. Table 16.2 gives an overview of the peripheral
nervous system.
