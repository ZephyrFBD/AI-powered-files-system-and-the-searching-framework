5 atoms from 3RuBP = 18 atoms in 3 atoms of
3-PGA). This process is called carbon fixation, because CO2 is “fixed” from an inorganic form into organic molecules.
Stage 2: Reduction
ATP and NADPH are used to convert the six molecules of 3-PGA into six molecules of a chemical called glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate (G3P). That is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by 3-PGA. Recall that a reduction
is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule. Six molecules of both ATP and NADPH are used. For ATP, energy is
released with the loss of the terminal phosphate atom, converting it into ADP; for NADPH, both energy and a hydrogen
atom are lost, converting it into NADP+. Both of these molecules return to the nearby light-dependent reactions to be reused
and reenergized.
Stage 3: Regeneration
Interestingly, at this point, only one of the G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle and is sent to the cytoplasm to contribute
to the formation of other compounds needed by the plant
