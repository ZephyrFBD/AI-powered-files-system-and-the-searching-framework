ic acid group. In 
the C ¬O¬ H bond system, the electrons are shifted from H, 
facilitating loss of the H as a proton. 
 (Section 16.10)
(b) To determine the extent of ionization, we first set up the ion-
ization equilibrium and equilibrium-constant expression. 
Using HPv as the symbol for the acid, we have
HPv ∆H+ + Pv-
Ka =
3H+43Pv-4
3HPv4
= 3.2 * 10-3
Let 3Pv-4 = x. Then the concentration of undissociated acid is 
2 * 10-4 - x. The concentration of 3H+4 is ﬁxed at 4.0 * 10-8 M 
(the antilog of the pH value). Substituting, we obtain
3.2 * 10-3 =
14.0 * 10-821x2
12 * 10-4 - x2
Solving for x, we obtain
x = 3Pv-4 = 2 * 10-4 M
This is the initial concentration of acid, which means that es-
sentially all the acid has dissociated. We might have expected 
this result because the acid is quite dilute and the acid- 
dissociation constant is fairly high.
(c) Pyruvic acid should be quite soluble in water because it has 
polar functional groups and a small hydrocarbon component. 
We would predic
