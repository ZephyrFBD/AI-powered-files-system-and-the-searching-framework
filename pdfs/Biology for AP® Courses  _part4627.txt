Activity
Investigate a food web in an aquatic or terrestrial ecosystem of your choice, for example, coral reef. Create
a diagram of the food web and describe the role of each organism in the web. Then arbitrarily remove one
organism from the food web and predict how this will affect the ecosystem with respect to the movement of
matter and energy. Put that organism back in your food web and remove a different organism. Predict how
the ecosystem will be affected. Was your prediction the same as it was for the first organism?
