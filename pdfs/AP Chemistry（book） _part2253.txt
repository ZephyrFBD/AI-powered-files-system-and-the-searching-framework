 O1g2 ¡ 3 O21g2 + O1g2
Because O(g) appears in equal amounts on both sides of the equa-
tion, it can be eliminated to give the net equation for the chemical 
process:
2 O31g2 ¡ 3 O21g2
(c) The intermediate is O(g). It is neither an original reactant nor 
a ﬁnal product but is formed in the ﬁrst step of the mecha-
nism and consumed in the second.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Consider the following two-step reaction mechanism:
 A1g2 + B1g2 ¡ X1g2 + Y1g2

or are true?
 (i) Both of the steps in this mechanism are bimolecular.
 (ii) The overall reaction is A1g2 + B1g2 + C1g2 ¡ Y1g2 + Z1g2.
 (iii) The substance X(g) is an intermediate in this mechanism.
(a) Only one of the statements is true.
(b) Statements (i) and (ii) are true.
(c) Statements (i) and (iii) are true.
(d) Statements (ii) and (iii) are true.
(e) All three statements are true.
