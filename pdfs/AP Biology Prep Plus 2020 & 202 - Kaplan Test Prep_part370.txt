Which of the following can most reasonably be concluded from
the experimental results?
The optimum pH of the lactase-catalyzed reaction is pH 11.
(A)
Maximum lactase activity is reached when the lactose
concentration is 0.05 g/mL.
(B)
Lactase concentration decreases as pH decreases.
(C)
As lactose concentration approaches 0.4 g/mL, lactase
becomes saturated.

8. Amylase catalyzes the breakdown of starch into maltose. Students
used the iodine test to investigate the hydrolysis of starch at
varying temperatures over time. Adding iodine to starch results in
a dark blue-black complex. The results of the reactions are shown
in the figure below.
Based on this data, what is the optimum temperature range of
amylase? 
21oC ≤ t ≤ 30oC
(A)
31oC ≤ t ≤ 40oC
(B)
41oC ≤ t ≤ 50oC
(C)
51oC ≤ t ≤ 60oC
