• The  described experiment could produce these data
 
( Experimental design included sufficient range, varied the temp/pH of the reaction mix not the enzyme, what
was measured, and how it was measured)
• Held experimental factors constant (specified at least one )
• 
Specified a control group for comparison (no enzyme or  boiled enzyme or no substrate)
• Verified results (e.g. repeated trials; results represent an average)
• Hypothesis clearly related to experiment  of choice, and clearly  identified as a hypothesis;
