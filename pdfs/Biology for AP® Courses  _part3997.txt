ple of induced
immune response as they are induced after cell
surface markers on invading pathogens are
recognized by host cells. Interferons are an
example of immediate immune response as they
attack host cells that have lost normal cell
surface markers.
31. Why might different MHC I molecules between donor
and recipient cells lead to rejection of a transplanted organ
or tissue?
a.
The natural killer cells in the recipient will
identify the MHC I molecules on transplanted
organ as non-self proteins, causing lysis of
transplanted cells. Other host cells will join to
phagocytize the foreign cells.
b.
The neutrophils in the recipient will identify the
MHC I molecules on transplanted organ as non-
self proteins, causing lysis of transplanted cells.
Other host cells will join to phagocytize the
foreign cells.
c.
B lymphocytes in the recipient will identify the
MHC I molecules on transplanted organ as non-
self proteins. The foreign cells will then be
engulfed and destroyed by B lymphocytes
