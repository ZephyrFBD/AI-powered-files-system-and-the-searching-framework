ure pyramid. It shows a distribution
of the population by age and percentage of the entire population.
There are very few elderly people, and the population of young
people approaching reproductive age is very large and getting even
larger. One can assume that barring some disaster or law limiting the
number of children a couple can have, a larger and larger number of
people in the future will have children. (ENE-1)
(C) The main point here is that with an increased population, there
will be increase in the demand for resources, regardless of any other
variable. (ENE-4)
(D) The graph shows a population whose size is rapidly decreasing.
Choice A shows a population that will get much larger in the future
because there is a large number of children who have yet to reach
procreation age. Choice B is a population with an even age
distribution. One can expect that the population size will not change
in the near future. Choice C shows a population with a fairly even
distribution, except for pe
