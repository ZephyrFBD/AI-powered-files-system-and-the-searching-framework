ion. This
is called the chloride shift. Bicarbonate leaves the red blood cells and enters the blood plasma. In the lungs, bicarbonate is
transported back into the red blood cells in exchange for chloride. The H+ dissociates from hemoglobin and combines with
bicarbonate to form carbonic acid with the help of carbonic anhydrase, which further catalyzes the reaction to convert
carbonic acid back into carbon dioxide and water. The carbon dioxide is then expelled from the lungs.
