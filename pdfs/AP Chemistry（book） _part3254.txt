ey do have one important short-
coming—the capacity of batteries made from LiMn2O4 is only 
about two-thirds that of batteries with LiCoO2 cathodes. Scientists 
and engineers are intensively looking for new materials that will 
lead to further improvements in the energy density, cost, lifetime, 
and safety of batteries.

a higher rate of conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy. Voltaic cells that per-
form this conversion using conventional fuels, such as H2 and CH4, are called fuel cells. 
Fuel cells are not batteries because they are not self-contained systems—the fuel must be 
continuously supplied to generate electricity.
The most common fuel-cell systems involve the reaction of H21g2 and O21g2 to form 
H2O1l2. These cells can generate electricity twice as efficiently as the best internal com-
bustion engine. Under acidic conditions, the reactions are
