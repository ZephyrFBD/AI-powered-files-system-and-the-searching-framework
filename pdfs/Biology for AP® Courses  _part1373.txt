pical of a two-gene interaction. Recall the phenotypic inheritance pattern for Mendel’s dihybrid cross, which
considered two non-interacting genes—9:3:3:1. Similarly, we would expect interacting gene pairs to also exhibit ratios
expressed as 16 parts. Note that we are assuming the interacting genes are not linked; they are still assorting independently
into gametes.

For an excellent review of Mendel’s experiments and to perform your own crosses and identify patterns of inheritance,
visit the Mendel’s Peas (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/mendels_peas) web lab.
Explain how Mendel’s experiments help modern-day farmers breed crops that exhibit preferred traits, like tall height
or large fruit size.
