ward and  
we have
so the normal force is  
Now we apply Newton’s second law for the
horizontal (x) direction (positive to the right), and include the friction force:
The friction force is kinetic friction as long as
is less than
which it is:
Hence the box does accelerate:
In the absence of friction, as we saw in Example 4–11, the acceleration would be
much greater than this.
NOTE Our final answer has only two significant figures because our least sig-
nificant input value
has two.

o push or to pull a sled? Your little sister
wants a ride on her sled. If you are on flat ground, will you exert less force if you
push her or pull her? See Figs. 4–31a and b
