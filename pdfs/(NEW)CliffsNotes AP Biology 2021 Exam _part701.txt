ces biodiversity. Temperature is strongly correlated with elevation, decreasing as elevation
increases. Precipitation often increases with elevation, although the water content of snow deposited at higher
elevations is only available to plants after it has melted.
Coniferous forests heavily laden with snow during the winter months become productive only after the snow has
melted. The stability of an ecosystem increases with increases in biodiversity. This occurs because, in a highly
diverse system, disturbances may adversely affect only a few of the components (species) of the ecosystem, while
one or more unaffected components can replace them. In systems with low biodiversity, disturbances may have a
more permanent effect. Disturbances that threaten the stability of ecosystems include fires, floods, disease, and the
various effects caused by humans (discussed in “Human Impact on Ecosystems” later in this chapter). Some
environmental disturbances are extremely disruptive, however, and
