 of
returning the mass to the equilibrium position; hence it is called a restoring force.
We consider the common situation where we can assume the restoring force F
is directly proportional to the displacement x the spring has been stretched 
(Fig. 11–1b) or compressed (Fig. 11–1c) from the equilibrium position:
[force exerted by spring]
(11;1)
Note that the equilibrium position has been chosen at
and the minus sign
in Eq. 11–1 indicates that the restoring force is always in the direction opposite 
to the displacement x. For example, if we choose the positive direction to the
right in Fig. 11–1, x is positive when the spring is stretched (Fig. 11–1b), but the
direction of the restoring force is to the left (negative direction). If the spring 
is compressed, x is negative (to the left) but the force F acts toward the right
(Fig. 11–1c).
Equation 11–1 is often referred to as Hooke’s law (Sections 6–4 and 9–5), and
is accurate only if the spring is not compressed to where the coils are cl
