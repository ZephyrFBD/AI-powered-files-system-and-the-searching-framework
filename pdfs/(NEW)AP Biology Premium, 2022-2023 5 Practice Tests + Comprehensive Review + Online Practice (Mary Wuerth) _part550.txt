heir lifetime. Each reproductive cycle
produces large numbers of offspring. However, r-selected populations invest little or no parental care in their
offspring, leading to much lower survival rates in the offspring. r-selected populations experience “boom or bust”
cycles, with periods of exponential growth leading to populations that far exceed the carrying capacity of an
environment (“booms”), followed by rapid decreases in the population size (“busts”). The size of r-selected
populations is usually not sensitive to population densities. Many fish and amphibian species have r-selected
reproductive strategies.
Community Ecology and Simpson’s Diversity Index
A community is a group of interacting populations living in the same habitat. Communities can be described by
their species composition and species diversity. Species composition is the number of species that live in an area.
Species diversity reflects the number of species in an area and the number of members of each of those spec
