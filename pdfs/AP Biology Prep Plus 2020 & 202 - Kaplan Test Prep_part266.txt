entering the
plant due to transpiration can be measured. The potometer tube takes
the place of soil as a source of water. The plant is then subjected to a
number of treatment eﬀects that might include increased light, darkness,
heat, or air movement. Changes in transpiration, if any, are compared to
the rate of transpiration of a control plant that is under stable conditions,
usually room temperature and room lighting. The control plant serves as
the benchmark with which all other treatment eﬀects are compared.
7.6 Investigate water movement through plants
Transpiration is aﬀected by environmental conditions in a way very
similar to human skin. Increasing the amount of heat around skin causes
increased sweat and air movement, which increases evaporation on the
skin surface; the result is increased water loss. The same is true for the
leaf surface of a plant—increased heat causes an increase in water loss.
Light or darkness in the absence of changes in temperature only aﬀects a
leaf by
