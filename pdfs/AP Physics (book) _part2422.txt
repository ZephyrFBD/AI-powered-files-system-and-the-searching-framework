*72. (III) A resonant circuit using a 260-nF capacitor is to reso-
nate at 18.0 kHz. The air-core inductor is to be a solenoid
with closely packed coils made from 12.0 m of insulated
wire 1.1 mm in diameter. How many loops will the inductor
contain?

Problem 74.
74. Suppose you are looking at two wire loops in the plane 
of the page as shown in Fig. 21–64. When switch S is closed
in the left-hand coil, (a) what is the direction of the induced
current in the other loop? (b) What is the situation after
a “long” time? (c) What is the direction of the induced 
current in the right-hand loop if that loop is quickly pulled
horizontally to the right? (d) Suppose the right-hand loop
also has a switch like the left-hand loop. The switch in the
left-hand loop has been closed a long time when the switch
in the right-hand loop is closed. What happens in this case?
Explain each answer.
