r the movement of water
through xylem. Because mature xylem consists of dead cells, osmotic pressure generated by concentration gradients
across plasma membranes cannot occur in xylem. The transport of water does not occur in phloem cells.
2. B. Chlorophyll is not known to be directly involved in flowering. 3. D. The last light to which the plants were
exposed makes the final
 
conversion between Pr and Pfr. Since red light was used last, all of the Pr is converted to Pfr, a shorter night period
is measured, and the
 
circadian clock is reset. Short-day plants are unaffected, but flowering in long-day plants (short-night plants) is
induced.
 
4. A. CO2 levels are relatively low in leaves when photosynthesis is
 
active, which occurs only during the day and when the stomata are open. At night or when daytime environmental
conditions are severe (hot and
 
dry), stomata close, photosynthesis stops, and CO2 levels increase as a
 
result of respiration. Guard cells close when water moves ou
