ndel performed seven monohybrid crosses involving
contrasting traits for each characteristic. On the basis of his results in F1 and F2 generations, Mendel postulated that each
parent in the monohybrid cross contributed one of two paired unit factors to each offspring, and every possible combination
of unit factors was equally likely.
To demonstrate a monohybrid cross, consider the case of true-breeding pea plants with yellow versus green pea seeds.
The dominant seed color is yellow; therefore, the parental genotypes were YY for the plants with yellow seeds and yy for
the plants with green seeds, respectively. A Punnett square, devised by the British geneticist Reginald Punnett, can be
drawn that applies the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected
frequencies. To prepare a Punnett square, all possible combinations of the parental alleles are listed along the top (for one
parent) and side (for the other parent) of a grid, repr
