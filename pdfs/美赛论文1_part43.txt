due to the index is linear. In fact, it is very difficult to achieve in the reality. 
ÔÅ¨ Incomplete assumptions. Although some assumptions are made, they are not 
comprehensive. For example, we consider the relationship among the main 
factors. However, the factors in the secondary criteria layer also have links and 
the corresponding situations are more complex. Thus, we do not consider them.

7. Conclusion 
Our evaluation model is the combination of analytic hierarchy process model, 
dynamic weighted comprehensive model and connection model, which illuminates the 
influence of unexpected data as well as shows the link between main factors to 
present a relatively objective, available index to determine the sustainability. Then we 
take the additional uncertain factors into consideration and put a sub model into our 
model. Through our model, by using control variate method, we can determine which 
policies or strategies are the most effective.
