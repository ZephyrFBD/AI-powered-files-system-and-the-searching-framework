2.B.2: Growth and dynamic homeostasis are maintained 
by the constant movement of molecules across 
membranes.
Science Practice
1.4: The student can use representations and models to 
analyze situations or solve problems qualitatively 
and quantitatively.
Learning Objective 
2.12: The student is able to use representations and models 
to analyze situations or solve problems qualitatively and 
quantitatively to investigate whether dynamic homeostasis 
is maintained by the active movement of molecules across 
membranes.
(A)
This option is incorrect because the cells would shrink in a hypertonic solution, 
not a physiological saline solution, which means the solution is isotonic to a 
normal RBC.
(B)
This option is incorrect because RBCs do not have the ability to pump water out. 
Red blood cells lack internal membrane-bound organelles.
(C)
This option is correct. The saline solution is isotonic relative to the RBCâ€™s 
cytoplasm. This will result in a dynamic equilibrium. Vi
