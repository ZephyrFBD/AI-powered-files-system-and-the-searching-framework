ving leaves on a pond as waves move
by. The leaves (or a cork) are not carried forward by the waves, but oscillate more
or less up and down about an equilibrium point because this is the motion of the
water itself.
Waves can move over large distances, but the medium (the water or the rope)
itself has only a limited movement, oscillating about an equilibrium point as in
simple harmonic motion. Thus, although a wave is not itself matter, the wave 
pattern can travel in matter. A wave consists of oscillations that move without
carrying matter with them.
Wave vs. particle velocity. Is the velocity
of a wave moving along a rope the same as the velocity of a particle of the rope?
See Fig. 11–22.
RESPONSE No. The two velocities are different, both in magnitude and direc-
tion. The wave on the rope of Fig. 11–22 moves to the right along the tabletop,
but each piece of the rope only vibrates to and fro, perpendicular to the traveling
wave. (The rope clearly does not travel in the direction that
