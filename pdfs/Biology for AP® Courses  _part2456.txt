es. Therefore, they do not have a nucleus but instead generally have a single chromosomeâ€”a piece of circular,
double-stranded DNA located in an area of the cell called the nucleoid. Most prokaryotes have a cell wall outside the plasma
membrane.
Figure 22.10 The features of a typical prokaryotic cell are shown.
Recall that prokaryotes are divided into two different domains, Bacteria and Archaea, which together with Eukarya,
comprise the three domains of life (Figure 22.11).

Figure 22.11 Bacteria and Archaea are both prokaryotes but differ enough to be placed in separate domains. An
ancestor of modern Archaea is believed to have given rise to Eukarya, the third domain of life. Archaeal and bacterial
phyla are shown; the evolutionary relationship between these phyla is still open to debate.
The composition of the cell wall differs significantly between the domains Bacteria and Archaea. The composition of
their cell walls also differs from
