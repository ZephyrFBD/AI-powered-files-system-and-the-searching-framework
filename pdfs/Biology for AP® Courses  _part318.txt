rotein Structure
As discussed earlier, the shape of a protein is critical to its function. For example, an enzyme can bind to a specific substrate
at a site known as the active site. If this active site is altered because of local changes or changes in overall protein structure,
the enzyme may be unable to bind to the substrate. To understand how the protein gets its final shape or conformation, we
need to understand the four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.
Primary Structure
The unique sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure. For example, the pancreatic hormone
insulin has two polypeptide chains, A and B, and they are linked together by disulfide bonds. The N terminal amino acid of
the A chain is glycine, whereas the C terminal amino acid is asparagine (Figure 3.27). The sequences of amino acids in the
A and B chains are unique to insulin.
