in SCl2? (d) What valence orbitals, if any, remain unhybrid-
ized on the S atom in SCl2?
 9.51 Indicate the hybridization of the central atom in (a) BCl3,  
(b) AlCl4
-, (c) CS2, (d) GeH4.
 9.52  What is the hybridization of the central atom in (a) SiCl4,  
(b) HCN, (c) SO3, (d) TeCl2?
 9.53 Shown here are three pairs of hybrid orbitals, with each set 
at a characteristic angle. For each pair, determine the type of 
hybridization, if any, that could lead to hybrid orbitals at the 
specified angle.

you expect for the magnitude and direction of the bond 
dipoles in this series? (c) Write the formulas for the anal-

atom?
