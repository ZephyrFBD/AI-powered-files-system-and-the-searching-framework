However, when the bat or racket hits the ball, during the brief time of the colli-
sion those external forces are insignificant compared to the collision force the bat
or racket exerts on the ball. Momentum is conserved (or very nearly so) as long
as we measure 
and 
just before the collision and 
and 
immediately
after the collision (Eq. 7–3). We can not wait for external forces to produce their
effect before measuring 
and 
The above derivation can be extended to inclu
