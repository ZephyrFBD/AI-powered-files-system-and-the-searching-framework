An enzyme is a protein catalyst that reacts with every substrate
and speeds up every type of reaction. An enzyme speeds up
reactions by lowering the reaction’s energy of activation (Ea),
which is the amount of energy that is required to start the
reaction. Enzymes are specific, meaning they only react in
certain ways with certain substrates. This specificity is
determined by the shape of the substrate and the shape
(conformation) of the enzyme. The specific shape of an enzyme
results from interactions among the R-groups of the amino acids
that make up the enzyme. In order for the substrate to bond to an
enzyme, the substrate slightly alters the shape of an enzyme, so
that the fit is exact. The model for the specificity of enzyme
function is called “lock and key.”

I would choose an enzyme that was recently extracted from the
human liver. The easiest way to measure the amount of oxygen
that is released is to use an indicator called guaiacol, which turns
a
