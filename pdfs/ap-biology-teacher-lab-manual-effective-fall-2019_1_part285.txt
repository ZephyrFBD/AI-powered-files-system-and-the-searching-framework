eractions (big idea 4), and even evolution (big idea 1) 
if students raise questions about cellular respiration as a conserved core process, or 
compare different processes such as C3, C4, and CAM plants and the environments in 
which they evolved.

DIFFUSION AND OSMOSIS
What causes my plants to wilt if I forget to water them?
 
â– BACKGROUND
Cells must move materials through membranes and throughout cytoplasm in order 
to maintain homeostasis. The movement is regulated because cellular membranes, 
including the plasma and organelle membranes, are selectively permeable. Membranes 
are phospholipid bilayers containing embedded proteins. The phospholipid fatty acids 
limit the movement of water because of their hydrophobic characteristics. 
The cellular environment is aqueous, meaning that the solvent is water, in which 
the solutes, such as salts and organic molecules, are dissolved. Water may pass freely 
through the membrane by osmosis or through spec
