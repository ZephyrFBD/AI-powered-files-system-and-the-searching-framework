by three hydrogen bonds. Which base pair is more stable to 
heating? Why?
 11.80  Ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH) and pentane (C5H12) are 
both liquids at room temperature and room pressure, and 
have about the same molecular weight. (a) One of these liq-
uids is much more viscous than the other. Which one do 
you predict is more viscous? (b) One of these liquids has a 
much lower normal boiling point (36.1 °C) compared to the

CHAPTER 11 Liquids and Intermolecular Forces
Octane has a vapor pressure of 13.95 torr at 25 °C and a vapor 
pressure of 144.78 torr at 75 °C. Use these data and the equa-
tion in part (a) to calculate the heat of vaporization of octane. 
(c) By using the equation in part (a) and the data given in part 
(b), calculate the normal boiling point of octane. Compare 
your answer to the one you obtained from Exercise 1
1.81.
