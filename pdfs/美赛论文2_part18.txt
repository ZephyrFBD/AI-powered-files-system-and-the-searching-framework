Since the world medical association has announced that their new 
medication could stop Ebola and cure patients whose disease is not advanced. 
Medication will be used to cure the infected people and prevent the further 
spread later, thus λ is assumed to be a time-dependent variable .The effective 
contact people would decrease. The relationship between λ and t is assumed to 
be index according to the actual situation. 
We analyze the number of infected people during the recent weeks and 
predict to give the mathematical expression of effective contact people λ and 
time t: 
(t)= 0.13e^(a*t)  
                         (t)= 0.018*e^(b*t) 
 
Similarly, we consider the proportion of patients in the initial time（t=0）is 
I0，
the proportion of susceptible is S0，
taking t
