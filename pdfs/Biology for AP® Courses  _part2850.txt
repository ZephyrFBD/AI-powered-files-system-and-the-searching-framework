ocin, another hormone. However, the
loss of internal equilibrium due to positive feedback can be detrimental; for example, a small area of damaged heart tissue
can precipitate a heart attack which, in turn, damages even more cardiac muscle.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP
Biology速 Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP速 exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven Science Practices.
Big Idea 2
Biological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,
and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.
Enduring
Understanding
2.C
Organisms use feedback mechanisms to regulate growth and reproduction, and to maintain
dynamic homeostasis.
