Does the coordination number of iron change during this 
reaction? Does the oxidation number of iron change?

only four chlorides in 3FeCl44-. Ligands that transfer substantial 
negative charge to the metal also produce reduced coordination 
numbers. For example, six ammonia molecules can coordinate to 
nickel(II), forming 3Ni(NH3)642+, but only four cyanide ions can 
coordinate to this ion, forming 3Ni(CN)442-.
The most common coordination geometries for coordination 
complexes are shown in Figure 23.10. Complexes in which the coor-
dination number is 4 have two geometries—tetrahedral and square 
planar. The tetrahedral geometry is the more common of the 
two and is especially prevalent among nontransition metals. The 
square planar geometry is characteristic of transition-metal ions 
with eight d electrons in the valence shell, such as platinum(I
