Peroxisomes
Peroxisomes are small, round organelles enclosed by single membranes. They carry out oxidation reactions that break
down fatty acids and amino acids. They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body. (Many of these oxidation
reactions release hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, which would be damaging to cells; however, when these reactions are confined
to peroxisomes, enzymes safely break down the H2O2 into oxygen and water.) Glyoxysomes, which are specialized
peroxisomes in plants, are responsible for converting stored fats into sugars.
Vesicles and Vacuoles
Vesicles and vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs that function in storage and transport. Other than the fact that vacuoles are
somewhat larger than vesicles, there is a very subtle distinction between them: The membranes of vesicles can fuse with
either the plasma membrane or other membrane systems within the cell. Additionally,
