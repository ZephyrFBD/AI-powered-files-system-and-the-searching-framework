 2. Loeys-Dietz syndrome (type 2B) is a human genetic disorder associated with mutations in the LDS2B gene. 
Researchers have proposed that the LDS2B gene produces a growth factor receptor protein that regulates cell 
signaling pathways. The predicted product of the gene is a 565-amino acid protein with structural regions that 
bind to signaling molecules, span the plasma membrane, and have protein kinase activity. Protein kinases are 
cellular enzymes that transfer phosphate groups from AT
