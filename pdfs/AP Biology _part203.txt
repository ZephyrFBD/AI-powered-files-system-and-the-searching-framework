 result, NADH provides more energy for
ATP synthesis than does FADH2. Theoretically, each NADH
produces 3 ATP molecules, while each FADH2 produces 2 ATP
molecules.
The ETC consists mostly of cytochromes. These are proteins
structurally similar to hemoglobin. Cytochromes are present in all
aerobes and are used to trace evolutionary relationships.
One component of the ETC is labeled Q, which stands for
ubiquinone, or alternately coenzyme Q. The important thing about
Q is that it is a mobile electron carrier. It diffuses within and
along the membrane. If the cristae membrane were not fluid, Q
could not move through it, and the ETC could not operate. This
phenomenon is a great example of how the structure of a fluid
membrane relates to its function.
Exergonic reactions are coupled with endergonic ones. The
exergonic flow of electrons toward the highly electronegative
oxygen provides the energy for the endergonic pumping of protons
from the inner matrix to the outer compartment to create a
