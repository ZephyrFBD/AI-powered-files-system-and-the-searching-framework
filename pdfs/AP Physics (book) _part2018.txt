n you are standing outside in bare feet than when you
are inside wearing shoes with thick soles?
*19. Compare the drift velocities and electric currents in two
wires that are geometrically identical and the density of
atoms is similar, but the number of free electrons per atom
in the material of one wire is twice that in the other.
*20. A voltage V is connected across a wire of length 
and
radius r. How is the electron drift speed affected if (a) is
doubled, (b) r is doubled, (c) V is doubled, assuming in
each case that other quantities stay the same?

Question 8.
1. When connected to a battery, a lightbulb glows brightly. If
the battery is reversed and reconnected to the bulb, the bulb
will glow
(a) brighter.
(c) with the same brightness.
(b) dimmer.
(d) not at all.
2. When a battery is connected to a lightbulb properly, cur-
rent flows through the lightbulb and makes it glow. How
much current flows through the battery compared with the
lightbulb?
(a) More.
(b)
