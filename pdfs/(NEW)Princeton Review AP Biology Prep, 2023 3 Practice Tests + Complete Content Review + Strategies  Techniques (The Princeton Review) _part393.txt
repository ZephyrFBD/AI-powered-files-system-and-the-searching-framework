n see them; the dark moths continued doing their thing—above all, reproducing. And
when they reproduced, they had more and more offspring carrying the dark allele.
After a few generations, the peppered moth gene pool in City 2 changed. Although our original moth gene pool was
50 percent light and 50 percent dark, excessive predation changed the population’s genetic makeup. By about 1950,
the gene pool reached 90 percent dark alleles and only 10 percent light alleles. This occurred because the light moths
didn’t stand a chance in an environment where they were so easy to spot. The dark moths, on the other hand,
multiplied just as fast as they could.
In the southern city, you’ll remember, there was very little pollution. What happened there? Things remained pretty
much the same. The gene pool was unchanged, and the population continued to have roughly equal proportions of
light moths and dark moths.
