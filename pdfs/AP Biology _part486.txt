nd freshwater. In 1955, the saltwater
sticklebacks in Lake Washington tended to have up to 30 plates on
their bodies to protect them from large marine predators. However,
the freshwater species of sticklebacks in Lake Washington tended to
have little protective armor in 1955, when scientists began to study
the fish in the lake.
Which of the following statements predicts what you would expect
to happen to the freshwater sticklebacks in Lake Washington after
the cleanup in 1968 and provides the correct reasoning for that
prediction?
The number of plates on any individual freshwater stickleback
fish would increase if the threat from predation were great
enough.
The average number of plates in the freshwater stickleback fish
population would not change, even though the water became
clearer, because the number of plates on a fish is genetically
determined.
The average number of plates in the freshwater stickleback fish
population would increase as the water became clearer because
