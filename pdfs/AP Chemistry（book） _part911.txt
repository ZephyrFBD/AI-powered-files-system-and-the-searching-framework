an electron makes a transition from the ni = 4 level to a lower-energy level, nf = 3, 2, or 1, which transition would 
produce a photon with the shortest wavelength?
(b) What are the energy and wavelength of such a photon, and in which region of the electromagnetic spectrum does it lie?
(c) The image on the right shows the output of a detector that measures the intensity of light emitted from a sample of hydrogen atoms 
that have been excited so that each atom begins with an electron in the n = 4 state. What is the final state, nf, of the transition being 
detected?

SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to determine the energy and wavelength 
associated with various transitions involving an electron relaxing 
from the n = 4 state of the hydrogen atom to one of three lower- 
energy states.
Plan Given the integers representing the initial and final states of 
the electron, we can use Equation 6.6 t
