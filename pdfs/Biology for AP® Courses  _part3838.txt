Epinephrine and Norepinephrine
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are released by the adrenal medulla and nervous system respectively. They are the flight/
fight hormones that are released when the body is under extreme stress. During stress, much of the bodyâ€™s energy is used
to combat imminent danger. Kidney function is halted temporarily by epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones
