is applied to the rod, it moves to the right at a constant
speed of 
What is the magnetic field?
17. (III) In Fig. 21–11, the rod moves with a speed of 
on
rails 30.0 cm apart. The rod has a resistance of 
The
magnetic field is 0.35 T, and the resistance of the 
conductor is 
at a given instant. Calculate (a) the
induced emf, (b) the current in the 
conductor,
and (c) the external force needed to keep the rod’s velocity
constant at that instant.
18. (III) A 22.0-cm-diameter coil consists of 30 turns of circular
copper wire 2.6 mm in diameter. A uniform magnetic field,
perpendicular to the plane of the coil, changes at a rate of
Determine (a) the current in the loop, and
(b) the rate at which thermal energy is produced.
19. (III) The magnetic field perpendicular to a single 13.2-cm-
diameter circular loop of copper wire decreases uniformly
from 0.670 T to zero. If the wire is 2.25 mm in diameter,
how much charge moves past a point in the coil during this
operation?
