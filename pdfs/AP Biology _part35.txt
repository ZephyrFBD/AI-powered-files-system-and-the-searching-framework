Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons. The resulting
structure is called a molecule. A single covalent bond (—) results when
two atoms share a pair of electrons. A double covalent bond (=) results
when two atoms share two pairs of electrons. A triple covalent bond (≡)
results when two atoms share three pairs of electrons. If electrons are
shared equally between two identical atoms, the bond is a nonpolar bond.
This is the type of bond found in diatomic molecules, such as H2 (H—H)
and O2 (O=O). If electrons are shared unequally, the bond is referred to as
a polar covalent bond. This is the case between any two different atoms,
such as between atoms of carbon and oxygen in CO2.

MOLECULES—POLAR AND NONPOLAR
When two or more atoms form a bond, the entire resulting molecule is
either nonpolar (balanced or symmetrical) or polar (unbalanced). CO2
