CHAPTER 23 Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry
The chlorophylls, which are porphyrins that contain Mg(II) 
(Figure 23.13), are the key components in the conversion of solar energy 
into forms that can be used by living organisms. This process, called photo-
synthesis, occurs in the leaves of green plants:
6 CO2(g) + 6 H2O(l) ¡  C6H12O6(aq) + 6 O2(g) 
[23.6]
The formation of 1 mol of glucose, C6H12O6, requires the absorption of 
48 mol of photons from sunlight or other sources of light. Chlorophyll- 
containing pigments in the leaves of plants absorb the photons. Fig-
ure 23.13 shows that the chlorophyll molecule has a series of alternating, 
or conjugated, double bonds in the ring surrounding the metal ion. This 
system of conjugated double bonds makes it possible for chloroph
