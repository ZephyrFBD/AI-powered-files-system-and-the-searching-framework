are environmentally friendly 
(0.1% hydrogen peroxide and 0.3% guaiacol), they can be rinsed down a standard 
laboratory drain. The concentrations used in the investigations are deemed to be safe 
by all chemical standards, but recall that any compound has the potential to harm the 
environment. 
■ ALIGNMENT TO THE AP BIOLOGY CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK 
This investigation can be conducted during the study of concepts pertaining to cellular 
processes (big idea 2), including the structure and function of enzymes, or while 
exploring interactions at the molecular level (big idea 4). As always, it is important to 
make connections between big ideas and enduring understandings, regardless of where 
in the curriculum the lab is taught. The concepts align with the enduring understandings 
and learning objectives from the AP Biology Curriculum Framework, as indicated below. 
■ Enduring Understandings 
•  ENE-1: The highly complex organization of living systems requires constant input of 
energy and
