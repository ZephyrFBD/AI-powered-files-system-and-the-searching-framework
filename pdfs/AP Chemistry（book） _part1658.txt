ure and pressure, 1.2 L of N2 reacts with 
3.6 L of H2. If all the N2 and H2 are consumed, what volume of 
NH3, at the same temperature and pressure, will be produced?
The Ideal-Gas Equation (Section 10.4)
 10.29  (a) What conditions are represented by the abbreviation 
STP? (b) What is the molar volume of an ideal gas at STP? 
(c) Room temperature is often assumed to be 25 °C. Calcu-
late the molar volume of an ideal gas at 25 °C and 1 atm 
pressure. (d) If you measure pressure in bars instead of 
atmospheres, calculate the corresponding value of R in 
L-bar/mol-K.
 10.30  To derive the ideal-gas equation, we assume that the vol-
ume of the gas atoms/molecules can be neglected. Given the 
atomic radius of neon, 0.69 Å, and knowing that a sphere has 
a volume of 4pr3>3, calculate the fraction of space that Ne 
atoms occupy in a sample of neon at STP
.
 10.31  Suppose you are given two 1-L flasks and told that one con-
tains a gas of molar mass 30, the other a gas of molar mass 60,
