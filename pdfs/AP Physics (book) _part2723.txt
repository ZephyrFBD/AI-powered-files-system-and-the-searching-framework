ouble-slit experiment demonstrated the inter-
ference of light. The observed bright spots of the interference
pattern are explained as constructive interference between the
beams coming through the two slits, where the beams differ in
path length by an integral number of wavelengths. The dark
areas in between are due to destructive interference when the
path lengths differ by 
and so on. The angles at which
constructive interference occurs are given by

slits, and m is an integer

Two sources of light are perfectly coherent if the waves
leaving them are of the same single frequency and maintain the
same phase relationship at all times. If the light waves from the
two sources have a random phase with respect to each other
over time (as for two lightbulbs), the two sources are 
incoherent.
The frequency or wavelength of light determines
