Predicting the Effect of Acid on Solubility
dissolves in the presence of aqueous ammonia because Ag+ interacts with the Lewis base 
NH3, as shown in Figure 17.19. This process can be viewed as the sum of two reactions:
AgCl1s2 ∆ Ag+1aq2 + Cl-1aq2 
[17.21]
Ag+1aq2 + 2 NH31aq2 ∆ Ag1NH322
+1aq2 
[17.22]
 
Overall: AgCl1s2 + 2 NH31aq2 ∆
 
 Ag1NH322
+1aq2 + Cl -1aq2 
[17.23]
The presence of NH3 drives the reaction, the dissolution of AgCl, to the right as Ag+1aq2 is 
consumed to form Ag1NH322
+, which is a very soluble species.
For a Lewis base such as NH3 to increase the solubility of a metal salt, the base must 
be able to interact more strongly with the metal ion than water does. In other words, the 
NH3 must displace solvating H2O molecules  
 (Sections 13.1 and 16.11) in order to 
form 3Ag1NH3224+:
