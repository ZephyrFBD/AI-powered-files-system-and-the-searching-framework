 energies associated with dispersion forces are 0.1–30 kJ>mol. The 
wide range reflects the wide range in polarizabilities of molecules. By comparison, the 
energies associated with dipole–dipole interactions and hydrogen bonds are approxi-
mately 2–15 kJ>mol and 10–40 kJ/mol, respectively. Ion–dipole forces tend to be stron-
ger than the aforementioned intermolecular forces, with energies typically exceeding 
50 kJ>mol. All these interactions are considerably weaker than covalent and ionic bonds, 
which have energies that are hundreds of kilojoules per mole.

be larger than the energy of hydrogen bonding between the two 
molecules?
