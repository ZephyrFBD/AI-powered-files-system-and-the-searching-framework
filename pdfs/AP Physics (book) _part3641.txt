 LHC (Section 32–1).
Some theorists think SUSY and other theories are approximations to a more
fundamental, still undiscovered, M-theory. Edward Witten coined the term 
when proposing an 11 dimensional approximation, but never said what “M”
stands for.
The world of elementary particles is opening new vistas. What happens in the
future is bound to be exciting.

CHAPTER 32
Elementary Particles
Particle accelerators are used to accelerate charged particles,
such as electrons and protons, so they can have very high
energy collisions with other particles. High-energy particles
have short wavelength and so can be used to probe the structure
of matter in great detail (very small distances). High kinetic
energy also allows the creation of new particles through colli-
sions (via 
).
Cyclotrons and synchrotrons use a magnetic field to keep
the particles in a circular path and accelerate them at intervals
by high voltage. Linear accelerators accelerate particles along
a line. Colliding
