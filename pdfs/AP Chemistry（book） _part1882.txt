, where all interactions are antibonding (three nodal planes).
As the length of the chain increases, the number of molecular orbitals increases. 
Regardless of chain length, the lowest-energy orbitals are always the most bonding and 
the highest-energy orbitals always the most antibonding. Furthermore, because each 
lithium atom has only one valence shell atomic orbital, the number of molecular orbitals 
is equal to the number of lithium atoms in the chain. Because each lithium atom has one 
valence electron, half of the molecular orbitals are fully occupied and the other half are 
empty, regardless of chain length.*
electronic Band Structure If the chain becomes very long, there are so many molec-
ular orbitals that the energy separation between them becomes vanishingly small. As 
the chain length goes to infinity, the allowed energy states become a continuous band. 
For a crystal large enough to see with the eye (or even an optical microscope), the num-
ber of atoms is extremely larg
