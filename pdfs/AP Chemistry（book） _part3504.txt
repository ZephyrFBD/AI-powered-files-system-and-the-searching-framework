hydrogen–oxygen mix-
tures is used in liquid-fuel rocket engines such as those of the Space Shuttle. The hydro-
gen and oxygen are stored at low temperatures in liquid form.
Production of Hydrogen
When a small quantity of H2 is needed in the laboratory, it is usually obtained by the reac-
tion between an active metal such as zinc and a dilute strong acid such as HCl or H2SO4:
 
Zn1s2 + 2 H+1aq2 ¡ Zn2 +1aq2 + H21g2 
[22.7]
Large quantities of H2 are produced by reacting methane with steam at 1100 °C. We 
can view this process as involving two reactions:
 
CH41g2 + H2O1g2 ¡ CO1g2 + 3 H21g2 
[22.8]
 
CO1g2 + H2O1g2 ¡ CO21g2 + H21g2 
[22.9]
Carbon heated with water to about 1000 °C is another source of H2:
 
C1s2 + H2O1g2 ¡ H21g2 + CO1g2 
[22.10]
This mixture, known as water gas, is used as an industrial fuel.
Electrolysis of water consumes too much energy and is consequently too costly to be 
used commercially to produce H2. However, H2 is produced as a by-product in the electrol-
ysis of
