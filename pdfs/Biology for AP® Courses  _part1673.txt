ine to a growing
polypeptide chain. The anticodon AAG binds the Codon UUC on the mRNA. The amino acid phenylalanine is attached
to the other end of the tRNA.

What is the role of ribosomes in protein synthesis?
Connection for AP® Courses
After the information in the gene has been transcribed to mRNA, it is ready to be translated to polypeptide. The players in
translation include the mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNA molecules, amino acids, and various enzymes. Ribosomes consist
of small and large subunits of protein and rRNA which bind with mRNA; many ribosomes can move along the same mRNA
at a time. Translation begins at the initiating AUG on mRNA, specifying methionine, the first amino acid in any polypeptide.
Each amino acid is carried to the ribosome by attaching to a specific molecule of tRNA. A tRNA molecule often is depic
