onitoring the dialysis process. Treatment may include
taking and reporting a patient’s vital signs and preparing solutions and equipment to ensure accurate and
sterile procedures.

Patients undergoing dialysis use dialysis machines such as the one shown here. Their blood runs through
a tube that is immersed in a solution, with the walls of the tube actually being semipermeable membranes.
The solution is made so that urea, the main waste product produced by humans, is pulled out of the blood
through diffusion. The semi-permeable tube wall allows urea through, but keeps the larger components of
the blood, such as proteins and blood cells, within the tube. The “cleaned” blood is eventually returned to
the body.

by facilitated diffusion that allows urea to diffuse out of the blood

by active transport, which allows urea to diffuse out of the blood
