idence that acetyl-CoA negatively
regulates pyruvate dehydrogenase activity?
(A) The rate of the pyruvate
dehydrogenaseâ€“catalyzed reaction is
slower in the presence of a higher 
concentration of acetyl-CoA. 
(B)
The gene that encodes pyruvate
dehydrogenase is transcribed when excess
acetyl-CoA is detected. 
(C)
The accumulation of acetyl-CoA stops
after 70 seconds, regardless of the
reaction mixture. 
(D) Acetyl-CoA is continuously broken down
in the Krebs cycle.

8. Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is a genetic 
disease most commonly linked to a mutation in 
the a -subunit of the mitochondrial enzyme that 
causes the enzyme to cease functioning. As a 
result of the mutation, affected individuals build 
up dangerous amounts of lactic acid. Which of 
the following best explains the buildup of lactic 
acid in
