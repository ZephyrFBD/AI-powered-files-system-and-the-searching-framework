 down by enzymes in the synaptic cleft. For example, a common neurotransmitter,
acetylcholine, is broken down by cholinesterase. Degraded neurotransmitters are recycled by the presynaptic cell.
Some of the common neurotransmitters and the kind of activity they generate are summarized below:
1. Acetylcholine is commonly secreted at neuromuscular junctions, the gaps between motor neurons and muscle
cells, where it stimulates muscles to contract. At other kinds of junctions, it may produce an inhibitory postsynaptic
potential.
2. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin are derived from amino acids and are mostly secreted
between neurons of the central nervous system.
3. GABA is usually an inhibitory neurotransmitter among neurons in the brain.
A reflex arc is a rapid, involuntary response to a stimulus. It consists of two or three neuronsâ€”a sensory and motor
neuron and, in some reflex arcs, an interneuron. Although neurons may transmit information about the reflex
response to
