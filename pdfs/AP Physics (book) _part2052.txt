eries with a resistor r,
as shown in Fig. 19–1. Since this resistance r is inside the battery, we can never sepa-
rate it from the battery. The two points a and b in Fig. 19–1 represent the two
terminals of the battery. What we measure is the terminal voltage
When no current is drawn from the battery, the terminal voltage equals the emf,
which is determined by the chemical reactions in the battery:
However,
when a current I flows from the battery there is an internal drop in voltage 
equal to Ir. Thus the terminal voltage (the actual voltage applied to a circuit) is
[current I flows from battery] (19;1)
For example, if a 12-V battery has an internal resistance of 
then when 10 A
flows from the battery, the terminal voltage is 
The
internal resistance of a battery is usually small. For example, an ordinary flashlight
battery when fresh may have an internal resistance of perhaps 
(However, as
it ages and the electrolyte dries out, the internal resistance increases to many ohms.)
