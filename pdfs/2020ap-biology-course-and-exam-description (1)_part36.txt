mon ancestry or evolutionary change in 
response to distinct selective pressures.
BIG IDEA 3: INFORMATION STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION (IST)
Living systems store, retrieve, transmit, and respond to information 
essential to life processes. Genetic information provides for continuity 
of life, and, in most cases, this information is passed from parent to 
offspring via DNA. Nonheritable information transmission influences 
behavior within and between cells, organisms, and populations. These 
behaviors are directed by underlying genetic information, and responses to 
information are vital to natural selection and evolution. Genetic information 
is a repository of instructions necessary for the survival, growth, and 
reproduction of the organism. Genetic variation can be advantageous for 
the long-term survival and evolution of a species. 
BIG IDEA 4: SYSTEMS INTERACTIONS (SYI)
Biological systems interact, and these systems and their interactions 
exhibit complex properties. All biological sy
