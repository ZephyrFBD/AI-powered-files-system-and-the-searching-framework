The minus signs in Eqs. 21–2a and b are there to remind us in which direction
the induced emf acts. Experiments show that
a current produced by an induced emf moves in a direction so that the
magnetic field created by that current opposes the original change in flux.
This is known as Lenz’s law. Be aware that we are now discussing two distinct mag-
netic fields: (1) the changing magnetic field or flux that induces the current, and
(2) the magnetic field produced by the induced current (all currents produce a
magnetic field). The second (induced) field opposes the change in the first.
Lenz’s law can be said another way, valid even if no current can flow (as when
a circuit is not complete):
An induced emf is always in a direction that opposes the original change in
flux that caused it.
Let us apply Lenz’s law to the relative motion between a magnet and a coil,
