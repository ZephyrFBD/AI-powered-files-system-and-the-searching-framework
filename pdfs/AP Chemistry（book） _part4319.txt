ion in which the 
substrate molecule is pictured as fitting rather specifically 
into the active site on the enzyme. It is assumed that in being 
bound to the active site, the substrate is somehow activated for 
reaction. (Section 14.7)
low-spin complex A metal complex in which the electrons are 
paired in lower-energy orbitals. (Section 23.6)
macroporous Solids having pores that are visible to the naked 
eye. (Section 12.9)
magic numbers Numbers of protons and neutrons that result in 
very stable nuclei. (Section 21.2)
main-group elements Elements in the s and p blocks of the 
periodic table. (Section 6.9)
mass A measure of the amount of material in an object. In SI 
units, mass is measured in kilograms. (Section 1.5)
mass defect The difference between the mass of a nucleus and 
the total masses of the individual nucleons that it contains. 
(Section 21.6)
mass number The sum of the number of protons and neutrons 
in the nucleus of a particular atom. (Section 2.3)
mass percentage The n
