ntiﬁc studies on this at
davidicke.com, but when I went back to them as I was writing this
book the links to the science research website where they were
hosted were dead. Anything that challenges the oﬃcial narrative in
any way is either censored or viliﬁed. The oﬃcial narrative is so
unsupportable by the evidence that only deleting the truth can
protect it. A study by Chinese scientists still survived – with the
usual twist which it why it was still active, I guess. Yes, they found
that virtually all the masks they tested increased the daily intake of
microplastic ﬁbres, but people should still wear them because the
danger from the ‘virus’ was worse said the crazy ‘team’ from the
Institute of Hydrobiology in Wuhan. Scientists ﬁrst discovered
microplastics in lung tissue of some patients who died of lung cancer
in the 1990s. Subsequent studies have conﬁrmed the potential health
damage with the plastic degrading slowly and remaining in the
lungs to accumulate in volume. Wuhan researche
