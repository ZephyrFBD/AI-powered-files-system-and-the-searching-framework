evaluate cuticle thickness, as the stomatal peel you prepare only allows you to examine the surface.
Part II: Factors That Influence Transpiration Rate
In this part of the investigation, you design an experiment to investigate the effect of an environmental factor on
transpiration rate. In brief, the procedure is as follows:
1. Choose an environmental factor to investigate. Many of the factors above, such as temperature, humidity, light
intensity, and air movement, are appropriate environmental factors for this investigation because they can easily be
manipulated (varied over a range of different values).
2. Set up apparatus.
 
To measure transpiration rate using a single cutting of a plant, assemble a potometer by inserting a calibrated pipette
into one end of a flexible plastic tube. Bend the flexible tube into a U shape so that the open ends of the pipette and
tube are pointing up, and mount the tube and pipette on a ring stand. If available, you can substitute a gas pressure
sensor
