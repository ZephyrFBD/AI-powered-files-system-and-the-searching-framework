Required Course Content 
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
SYI-1
Living systems are organized in a hierarchy of structural levels that interact.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
SYI-1.E
Explain how subcellular 
components and organelles 
contribute to the function of 
the cell.
SYI-1.F
Describe the structural 
features of a cell that allow 
organisms to capture, store, 
and use energy.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SYI-1.E.1
Organelles and subcellular structures, and 
the interactions among them, support cellular 
function—
a. Endoplasmic reticulum provides mechanical 
support, carries out protein synthesis on 
membrane-bound ribosome
