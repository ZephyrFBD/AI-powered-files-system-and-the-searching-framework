3. Maternal inheritance is one pattern of inheritance which does not follow the rules of Mendelian genetics. It is
an example of uniparental inheritance in which all progeny have the genotype and phenotype of the female
parent.
Maternal inheritance can be demonstrated in the haploid fungus Neurospora by crossing the fungi in such a
way that one parent contributes the bulk of the cytoplasm to the progeny. This cytoplasm-contributing parent is
called the fe​male parent, even though no true sexual re​production occurs. The inheritance patterns of a mutant
strain of Neurospora called poky have been studied using such crosses. Poky differs from the wild-type in that
it is slow-growing and has abnormal quantities of cytochromes.
