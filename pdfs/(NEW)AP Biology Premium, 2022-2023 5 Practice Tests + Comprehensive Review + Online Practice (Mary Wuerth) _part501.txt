xual organs of the organisms are incompatible and prevent the transfer of
gametes, the species will remain reproductively isolated. Many species of snails are mechanically isolated
due to their reproductive organs being located in different parts of their shells. If their shell shapes are too
different, the sex organs of the snails cannot successfully copulate.
■Gametic isolation—Even if two organisms are able to successfully copulate, if their gametes are
incompatible, no zygote will be produced and the organisms will be reproductively isolated. Many examples
of this are found in plants, in which the pollen of one plant species cannot successfully fertilize the ova of
another plant species.
Postzygotic barriers include:
■Reduced hybrid viability—Two organisms that can form a zygote may still be reproductively isolated if that
zygote does not survive to adulthood. A number of species of salamanders can interbreed and produce
zygotes, but those zygotes do not survive to reproductive age
