nsume the next level. In the Silver Springs ecosystem
example (Figure 37.8), we see that the primary consumers produced 1103 kcal/m2/yr from the 7618 kcal/m2/yr of energy
available to them from the primary producers. The measurement of energy transfer efficiency between two successive
trophic levels is termed the trophic level transfer efficiency (TLTE) and is defined by the formula:
TLTE =  production at present trophic level
production at previous trophic level Ã— 100
In Silver Springs, the TLTE between the first two trophic levels was approximately 14.8 percent. The low efficiency of
energy transfer between trophic levels is usually the major factor that limits the length of food chains observed in a food

web. The fact is, after four to six energy transfers, there is not enough energy left to support another trophic level. In
the Lake Ontario example shown in Ecology of Ecosystems, only three energy transfers occurred between the primary
producer, (green
