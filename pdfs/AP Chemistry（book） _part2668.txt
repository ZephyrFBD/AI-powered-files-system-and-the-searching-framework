The volume of an adult’s stomach ranges from about 50 
mL when empty to 1 L when full. If the stomach volume is 
400 mL and its contents have a pH of 2, how many moles 
of H+ does the stomach contain? Assuming that all the H+ 
comes from HCl, how many grams of sodium hydrogen 
carbonate will totally neutralize the stomach acid?
