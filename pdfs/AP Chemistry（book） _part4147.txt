directly at the ligands will have higher energy than an electron in a d 
orbital with lobes that do not point directly at the ligands.
23.53 (a) 
dxy, dxz, dyz
dx2y2, dz2
∆
(b) The magnitude of ∆ and the energy of the d-d transition for a 
d1 complex are equal. (c) ∆= 220 kJ  >  mol 23.55 (a) Both min-
erals contain Cu2 +, 3Ar43d9. (b) Azurite will probably have the 
larger ∆. It absorbs orange visible light, which has shorter wave-
lengths than the red light absorbed by malachite. 23.57 (a) Ti3+, d1  
(b) Co3 +, d6 (c) Ru3 +, d5 (d) Mo5 +, d1 (e) Re3 +, d4 23.59 Yes. A weak-
ﬁeld ligand leads to a small ∆ value and a small d-orbital splitting 
energy. If the splitting energy of a complex is smaller than the energy 
required to pair electrons in an orbital, the complex is high spin.
