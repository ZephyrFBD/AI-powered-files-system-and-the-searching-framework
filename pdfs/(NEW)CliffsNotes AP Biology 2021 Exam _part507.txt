Question 1
Water enters roots through root hairs, hair-like extensions of cells that increase the absorptive surface area of roots.
In many cases, mycorrhizae, a mutualistic relationship between the plant roots and fungi, further increases surface
area and aids in the absorption of water and minerals. Once inside the root, water moves toward xylem cells by
moving from one cell to the next through plasmodesmata or through the cell walls. The xylem, dead cells consisting
only of cell walls, provides a tube through which water moves to the leaves and other plant parts. Water in the leaves
is used for photosynthesis or is lost by transpiration.
The movement of water is explained by the cohesion-tension theory. In this mechanism, tension is developed when
water is pulled up a column by the transpiration of water through stomata. An entire column of water moves as a
unit because of the cohesion of water molecules that results from hydrogen bonding. In addition, th
