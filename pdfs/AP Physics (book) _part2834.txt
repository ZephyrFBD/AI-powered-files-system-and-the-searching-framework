hase-contrast microscopes.
An interference microscope makes use of the wave properties of light in a
direct way to increase contrast in a transparent object. Consider a transparent
object—say, a bacterium in water (Fig. 25–34). Coherent light enters uniformly
from the left and is in phase at all points such as a and b. If the object is as trans-
parent as the water, the beam leaving at d will be as bright as that at c. There will
be no contrast and the object will not be seen. However, if the object’s refractive
index is slightly different from that of the surrounding medium, the wavelength
within the object will be altered as shown. Hence light waves at points c and d
will differ in phase, if not in amplitude. The interference microscope changes this
difference in phase into a difference of amplitude which our eyes can detect. Light
that passes through the sample is superimposed onto a reference beam that does
not pass through the object, so that they interfere. One way of doing this
