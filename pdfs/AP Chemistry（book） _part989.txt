ment 79), we see that Au has a completely full 4f 14 subshell 
beyond its noble-gas core, but those 4f electrons are not involved in bonding. In general, 
for representative elements we do not consider the electrons in completely filled d or f subshells to 
be valence electrons, and for transition elements we do not consider the electrons in a completely 
filled f subshell to be valence electrons.
Anomalous Electron Configurations
The electron configurations of certain elements appear to violate the rules we have 
just discussed. For example, Figure 6.31 shows that the electron configuration of 
chromium (element 24) is 3Ar43d54s1 rather than the 3Ar43d44s2 configuration we
