2.8 Exponential and Logarithmic Equations 
2.8.1 Exponential Equations 
An exponential equation is one in which the variable occurs in the exponent. 
Some exponential equations can be solved by using the fact that exponential functions are 
one-to-one.  
This means that

GUIDELINES FOR SOLVING EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS 
1. Isolate the exponential expression on one side of the equation. 
2. Take the logarithm of each side, then use the Laws of Logarithms to “bring down 
the exponent.” 
3. Solve for the variable. 
 
Example 1 
Consider the exponential equation 3x+2 =7. 
(a) Find the exact solution of the equation expressed in terms of logarithms. 
(b) Use a calculator to find an approximation to the solution rounded to six decimal places.
