an exert a force on a wad of paper and accelerate it to fly across the room.
Other materials may not stretch as readily as rubber, but they do stretch or
compress when a force is applied to them. And just as a stretched rubber band
exerts a force, so does a stretched (or compressed) wall, desk, or car fender.
From the examples discussed above, we can see how important it is to
remember on what object a given force is exerted and by what object that force 
is exerted. A force influences the motion of an object only when it is applied on
that object. A force exerted by an object does not influence that same object; it
only influences the other object on which it is exerted. Thus, to avoid confusion,
the two prepositions on and by must always be used—and used with care.
One way to keep clear which force acts on which object is to use double sub-
scripts. For example, the force exerted on the Person by the Ground as the person
walks in Fig. 4–11 can be labeled 
And the force exerted on the
