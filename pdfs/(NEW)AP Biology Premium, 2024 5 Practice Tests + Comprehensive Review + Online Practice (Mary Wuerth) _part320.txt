Linked Genes
As discussed in Chapter 12, genes that are close together on the same chromosome are said to be linked. Since
linked genes are on the same chromosome (which is a long piece of DNA), they tend to be inherited together more
often than unlinked genes (which are on separate chromosomes).
During prophase I of meiosis, genetic recombination may occur between linked genes. The farther apart two
linked genes are on a chromosome, the more likely a genetic recombination event will occur because there is more
space in which recombination can happen. The closer together two linked genes are on a chromosome, the less
likely a genetic recombination event will occur. Recombination frequencies can be used to create genetic maps that
show the distance between genes on a chromosome, as shown in Table 14.1 and Figure 14.1. The distance between
genes is measured in map units. A recombination frequency of 10% between two genes would place those two
genes 10 map units apart. A recomb
