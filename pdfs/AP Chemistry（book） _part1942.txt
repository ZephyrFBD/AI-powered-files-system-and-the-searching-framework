e band gap is tunable with 
the crystal size, and thus all the colors of the rainbow can be obtained from just one 
material, as shown for CdSe in Figure 12.45.

Decreasing size
Go Figure
As the size of the quantum dots decreases, does the 
wavelength of the emitted light increase or decrease?

▲ Figure 12.45 Photoluminescence depends on particle 
size at the nanoscale. When illuminated with ultraviolet 
light, these solutions, each containing nanoparticles of the 
semiconductor CdSe, emit light that corresponds to their 
respective band gap energies. The wavelength of the light 
emitted depends on the size of the CdSe nanoparticles.
Give It Some Thought
Large crystals of ZnS can show photoluminescence, emitting 
ultraviolet photons with energies equal to the band gap energy and 
a wavelength of 340 nm. Is it
