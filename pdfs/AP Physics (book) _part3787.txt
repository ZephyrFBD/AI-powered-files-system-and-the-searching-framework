Summary
A universe in which life as we know it could not exist. [For example, if the difference
in mass between a proton and a neutron were zero, or less than the mass of 
the electron,
, there would be no atoms: electrons would be
captured by protons to make neutrons.] Such results have contributed to a
philosophical idea called the anthropic principle, which says that if the universe
were even a little different than it is, we could not be here. We physicists are
trying to find out if there are some undiscovered fundamental laws that
determined those conditions that allowed us to exist. A poet might say that the
universe is exquisitely tuned, almost as if to accommodate us.

the energy generated in its core. What happens when it
