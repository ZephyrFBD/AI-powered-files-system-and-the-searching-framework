a terminal electron acceptor for oxidative phosphorylation.
10. D
Choices (A) and (B) are clearly wrong, as they defy physics. Choice (C) is not correct because the anabolic
and catabolic reactions are not necessarily equal nor are they direct opposites. Choice (D) is the correct answer
because it explains the increase in entropy. Even though organisms build and develop as ordered systems, heat
is lost continuously. Additionally, organisms exhale gases and produce waste products that balance the effect
of order.

C
During anaphase, the chromatids are separated by shortening of the spindle fibers. Chemically blocking the
shortening of these fibers would arrest the cell in metaphase. The cells are arrested in metaphase as indicated
by the alignment of the chromosomes in the center of the cell and their attachment to spindle fibers,
eliminating (A) and (D). The chromosomes still seem to be attached to the fibers, so there doesnâ€™t appear
