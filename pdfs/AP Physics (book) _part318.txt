General Problems
57. Apollo astronauts took a “nine iron” to the Moon and hit
a golf ball about 180 m. Assuming that the swing, launch
angle, and so on, were the same as on Earth where the
same astronaut could hit it only 32 m, estimate the accel-
eration due to gravity on the surface of the Moon. (We
neglect air resistance in both cases, but on the Moon there
is none.)
61. Raindrops make an angle with the vertical when viewed
through a moving train window (Fig. 3–52). If the speed
of the train is 
what is the speed of the raindrops in the
reference frame of
the Earth in which
they are assumed to
fall vertically?
