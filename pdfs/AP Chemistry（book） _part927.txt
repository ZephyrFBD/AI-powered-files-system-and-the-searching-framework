 which the electron’s position can be determined. This is 
the essence of the uncertainty principle: There is an uncertainty 
in simultaneously knowing both the position and the momentum of 
the electron that cannot be reduced beyond a certain minimum level. 
The more accurately one is known, the less accurately the other 
is known.
Although we can never know the exact position and momen-
tum of the electron, we can talk about the probability of its being 
at certain locations in space. In Section 6.5, we introduce a model 
of the atom that provides the probability of finding electrons of 
specific energies at certain positions in atoms.

string have nodes, points where the magnitude of the wave is zero, so do the waves char-
