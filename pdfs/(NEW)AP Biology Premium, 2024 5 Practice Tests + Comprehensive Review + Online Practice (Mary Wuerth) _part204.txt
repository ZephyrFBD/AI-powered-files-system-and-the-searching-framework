pendent reactions is
released to the atmosphere and the Calvin cycle consumes, not produces, carbon dioxide. Choice (C) is incorrect
because the carbon dioxide needed for the Calvin cycle is absorbed from the atmosphere and the Calvin cycle
does not produce oxygen. Choice (D) is incorrect because the light-dependent reactions send NADPH to the
Calvin cycle and the Calvin cycle returns NADP+ to the light-dependent reactions.
10. (D) NADP+ is the final electron acceptor in the light-dependent reactions. NADP+ becomes NADPH after
accepting electrons. Choice (A) is incorrect because oxygen is the final electron acceptor in cellular respiration,
not photosynthesis. Water does not function as an electron acceptor, so choice (B) is incorrect. NAD+ is not
used in photosynthesis; it is used in cellular respiration. Thus, choice (C) is incorrect.
