CHARACTERISTICS OF ENZYMES
Enzymes are globular proteins that exhibit tertiary structure.
Enzymes are substrate specific. In Figure 5.3, only substrate A will
bind to the enzyme.

Figure 5.3 Enzymes Are Specific
The induced-fit model describes how enzymes work. As the
substrate enters the active site, it induces the enzyme to alter its
shape slightly so the substrate fits better. The old lock and key
model was abandoned because it falsely implied that the lock and
the key were unchanging.
The enzyme binds to its substrate(s), forming an enzyme-substrate
complex.
Figure 5.4 Enzyme Reactions Are Reversible
Enzymes are not destroyed during a reaction. They are reused.
Enzymes are named after their substrate, and the name ends in the
suffix “ase.” For example, sucrase is the name of the enzyme that
hydrolyzes sucrose, and lactase is the name of
