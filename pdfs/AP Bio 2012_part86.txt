Science Practice
2.2: The student can apply mathematical routines to 
quantities that describe natural phenomena.
Learning Objective 
2.6: The student is able to use calculated surface area-to-
volume ratios to predict which cell(s) might eliminate 
wastes or procure nutrients faster by diffusion.
(A)
This option is correct. It demonstrates the ability to calculate surface area-to-
volume ratios and predict their effects on a cellâ€™s ability to exchange materials 
with its environment. The cell shown in A has the greatest surface area-to-
volume ratio at 0.6:1.
(B)
This option is incorrect. That cell does not have the greatest surface area-to-
volume ratio at 0.3:1.
(C)
This option is incorrect. That cell does not have the greatest surface area-to-
volume ratio at 0.2:1.
(D)
This option is incorrect. That cell does not have the greatest surface area-to-
volume ratio at 0.1:1.
