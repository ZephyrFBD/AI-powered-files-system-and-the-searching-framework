cells. The division of somatic cells, like those in tissues, can also be regulated by density-dependent inhibition.
When cells in tissues, for example, become too crowded, they will stop dividing. Many types of somatic cells also
exhibit anchorage dependence, which is when cells need to be attached to a surface in order to divide. Cancer cells
are not regulated by density-dependent inhibition or anchorage dependence and can continue to grow and divide
under conditions that would cause normally functioning somatic cells to stop dividing.
TIP
While it IS important to know that cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases work together to regulate the cell cycle, you do NOT need to know the
names of specific cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase pairs.
Many genes are also involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. Proto-oncogenes propel cell division at a
specific rate, much as an accelerator propels a car. Proto-oncogenes are necessary for regulated and controlled cell
growth. If mutated, pro
