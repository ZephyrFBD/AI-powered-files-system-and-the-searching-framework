CHAPTER 12 Solids and Modern Materials
extra bonds provided by the interstitial component causes the metal lattice to become 
harder, stronger, and less ductile. For example, steel, which is much harder and stronger 
than pure iron, is an alloy of iron that contains up to 3% carbon. Other elements may be 
added to form alloy steels. Vanadium and chromium may be added to impart strength, for 
instance, and to increase resistance to fatigue and corrosion.
