are metals. Referring to Table 4.5, are these metals mostly 
found at the bottom or top of the activity series?
 7.12  Moseley’s experiments on X rays emitted from atoms led to 
the concept of atomic numbers. (a) If arranged in order of 
increasing atomic mass, which element would come after 
chlorine? (b) Describe two ways in which the properties of 
this element differ from the other elements in group 8A.
 7.13  Among elements 1–18, which element or elements have the 
smallest effective nuclear charge if we use Equation 7.1 to cal-
culate Zeff? Which element or elements have the largest effec-
tive nuclear charge?
 7.14  Which of the following statements about effective nuclear 
charge for the outermost valence electron of an atom is incor-
rect? (i) The effective nuclear charge can be thought of as the 
true nuclear charge minus a screening constant due to the other 
electrons in the atom. (ii) Effective nuclear charge increases
