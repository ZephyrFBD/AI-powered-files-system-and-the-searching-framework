e crystal lattice (as counterions), we have the 
violet compound 3Cr(H2O)64Cl3. When the ligands are five H2O and one Cl-, with 
the sixth H2O and the two Cl- out in the lattice, we have the green compound 
3Cr(H2O)5Cl4Cl2 # H2O. The third isomer, 3Cr(H2O)4Cl24Cl # 2 H2O, is also a green 
compound. In the two green compounds, either one or two water molecules have 
been displaced from the coordination sphere by chloride ions. The displaced H2O 
molecules occupy a site in the crystal lattice.
Stereoisomerism
Stereoisomers have the same chemical bonds but different spatial arrangements. In 
the square-planar complex 3Pt(NH3)2Cl24, for example, the chloro ligands can be 
either adjacent to or opposite each other (Figure 23.21). (We saw an earlier example 
of this type of isomerism in the cobalt complex of Figure 23.8, and we will return 
to that complex in a moment.) This form of stereoisomerism, in which the arrange-
ment of the atoms is different but the same bonds are present, is calle
