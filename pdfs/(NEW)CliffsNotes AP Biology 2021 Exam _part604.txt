from the hypothalamus, the anterior pituitary in males secretes FSH and LH. LH stimulates the
Leydig cells, located between the seminiferous tubules, to produce testosterone and other male sex hormones
(androgens). Under the influence of FSH and testosterone, Sertoli cells promote the development of sperm. In
contrast to females, however, hormone and gamete production are constant during the reproductive life of the male.
In addition to influencing the production of sperm and eggs, testosterone and estrogen stimulate the development of
the secondary sex characteristics in males and females, respectively.
Factors That Influence Embryonic Development
Fertilization occurs when the sperm penetrates the plasma membrane of the secondary oocyte. The fertilized egg, or
zygote, now begins a series of cleavage divisions, rapid cell divisions without cell growth. As a result, each of the
resulting cells contains substantially less cytoplasm than the original zygote.
