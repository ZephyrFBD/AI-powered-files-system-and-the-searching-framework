an you make about the genetic and phenotypic
variation of future populations for this group of voles?
a.
Either there was fewer food available or the
degree of predation increased. The future
generations of this group of voles should
evidence fewer genetic variation.
b.
Either there was fewer food available or the
degree of predation increased. The future
generations of this group of voles should
evidence greater genetic variation.
c.
Either there was more food available or the
degree of predation decreased. The future
generations of this group of voles should
evidence less genetic variation.
d.
Either there was more food available or the
degree of predation decreased. The future
generations of this group of voles should
evidence greater genetic variation.
67. There are years of drought in a small, relatively
isolated community. During the drought, small seeds with
thin shells become rare. Large seeds with hard cases
become increasingly common. The large, tough seeds are
