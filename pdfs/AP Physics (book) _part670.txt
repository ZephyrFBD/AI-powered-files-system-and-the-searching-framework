he average coefficient of
friction?
52. (II) You drop a ball from a height of 2.0 m, and it bounces
back to a height of 1.6 m. (a) What fraction of its initial
energy is lost during the bounce? (b) What is the ball’s speed
just before and just after the bounce? (c) Where did the
energy go?
53. (II) A 66-kg skier starts from rest at the top of a 1200-m-
long trail which drops a total of 230 m from top to bottom.
At the bottom, the skier is moving 
How much
energy was dissipated by friction?
54. (II) A projectile is fired at an upward angle of 38.0° from
the top of a 135-m-high cliff with a speed of 
What
will be its speed when it strikes the ground below? (Use
conservation of energy.)
55. (II) The Lunar Module could make a safe landing if its 
vertical velocity at impact is 
or less. Suppose that
you want to determine the greatest height h at which the
pilot could shut off the engine if the velocity of the lander
relative to the surface at that moment is (a) zero; (b)
downward; (c)
