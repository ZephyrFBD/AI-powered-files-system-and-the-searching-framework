is the spread of disease. The brown bat pictured
below has a contagious fungal infection called white nose syndrome.

How would infection of zebras by Bacillus anthracis be describedâ€”as a density-dependent or density-independent
factor that regulates population growth?
a.
This is an example of a density-independent factor because it becomes worse as the population density
increases.
b.
This is an example of a density-dependent factor because it becomes better as the population density
increases.
c.
This is an example of a density-dependent factor because it becomes worse as the population density
increases.
d.
This is an example of a density-independent factor since it becomes better as the population density
increases.
Density-independent Regulation and Interaction with Density-
dependent Factors
Many factors, typically physical or chemical in nature (abiotic), influence the mortality of a population regardless of its
