hydrazine (bottom, CH3NHNH2).
Oxides and Oxyacids of Nitrogen
Nitrogen forms three common oxides: N2O (nitrous oxide), NO (nitric oxide), and NO2 
(nitrogen dioxide). It also forms two unstable oxides that we will not discuss, N2O3 (dini-
trogen trioxide) and N2O5 (dinitrogen pentoxide).
Nitrous oxide 1N2O2 is also known as laughing gas because a person becomes giddy 
after inhaling a small amount. This colorless gas was the first substance used as a general 
anesthetic. It is used as the compressed gas propellant in several aerosols and foams, such 
as in whipped cream.
Hydroxylamine 1NH2OH2 reduces copper(II) to the free metal in acid solutions. Write a balanced equation for the reaction, 
assuming that N2 is the oxidation product.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to write a balanced oxidationâ€“reduction 
equation in which NH2OH is converted to N2 and Cu2 +  is con-
verted to Cu.
Plan Because this is a redox reaction, the equation can be balanced 
by the method of half-reactions discusse
