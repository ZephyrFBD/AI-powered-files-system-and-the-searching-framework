77. A solar cell, 3.0 cm square, has an output of 350 mA at
0.80 V when exposed to full sunlight. A solar panel that
delivers close to 1.3 A of current at an emf of 120 V to an
external load is needed. How many cells will you need to
create the panel? How big a panel will you need, and how
should you connect the cells to one another?
78. The current through the 
resistor in Fig. 19–77 is
3.10 mA. What is the
terminal voltage 
of
the “unknown”battery?

and 47.3 V when 2.80 A is drawn. What are the emf and
internal resistance of the battery?
