stive
enzymes, which they use to break down old, worn-out organelles, debris, or large ingested particles. Lysosomes
make up the cell’s clean-up crew, helping to keep the cytoplasm clear of unwanted flotsam. Lysosomes contain
hydrolytic enzymes that function only at acidic pH, which is enclosed inside the lumen of the lysosome. Lysosomes
are made when vesicles containing specific enzymes from the trans Golgi fuse with vesicles made during
endocytosis (which you’ll learn about in a bit). Lysosomes are also essential during programmed cell death called
apoptosis.
There are lots of examples in biology in which folding is used to increase
surface area. This is similar to the surface area-to-volume ratio concept we
mentioned earlier. Some common examples are inner mitochondrial
membrane, ER membrane, convoluted membranes in chloroplasts, brain
tissue, small intestine (villi and microvilli), alveoli in the lungs, or root hairs in
plants.
Centrioles
The centrioles are small, paired, cylindric
