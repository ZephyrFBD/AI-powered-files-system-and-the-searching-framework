ovide a variety or
a solution to a problem. Mutations just occur. If it is advantageous,
that new characteristic may increase in frequency in a population. If
it is deleterious, that trait may disappear.

The phenomenon of transpiration is dependent on the fact that
water molecules are strongly attracted to each other. The first
property of water, known as cohesion tension, is the force of
attraction between molecules of water as a result of hydrogen
bonding. Hydrogen bonding is the attraction of an oxygen atom
from one molecule of water to a hydrogen atom from another
molecule of water. The second property of water that is
responsible for water molecules “sticking” together is water’s
strong polarity. The positive side of one water molecule is
attracted to the negative side of an adjacent water molecule.

For this experiment, I would use three geranium plants (that are
similar in size, age, and appearance) and place the
