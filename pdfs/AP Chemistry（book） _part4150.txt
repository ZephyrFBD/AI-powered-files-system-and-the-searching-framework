 the only complex with a 
counter ion that can also be a ligand. 23.41 Yes. No structural or ste-
reoisomers are possible for a tetrahedral complex of the form MA2B2. 
The complex must be square planar with cis and trans geometric 
isomers. 23.43 (a) Unique structure, no other isomers (b) two geo-
metric isomers, trans and cis isomers with 180° and 90° Cl¬ Ir¬Cl 
angles, respectively (c) three geometric isomers; trans and cis iso-
mers with 180° and 90°  Cl¬Fe¬Cl angles, respectively; the cis iso-
mer has enantiomers 23.45 (a) Not chiral (b) not chiral (c) chiral, 
has optical isomers 23.47 (a) Blue (b) E = 3.26 * 10-19 J>photon  
(c) E =  196 kJ  >  mol 23.49 (a) Diamagnetic. Zn2 +, 3Ar43d10. There 
are no unpaired electrons. (b) Diamagnetic. Pd2 +, 3Kr44d8. Square pla-
nar complexes with 8 d-electrons are usually diamagnetic, especially 
with a heavy metal center like Pd. (c) Paramagnetic. V3 +, 3Ar43d2. 
The two d-electrons would be unpaired in any of the d-orbital energy 
level dia
