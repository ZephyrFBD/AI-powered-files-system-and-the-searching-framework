ach of the capacitors. That is, since the left-
hand plates of all the capacitors are connected by conductors, they all reach the
same potential 
when connected to the battery; and the right-hand plates each
reach potential 
Each capacitor plate acquires a charge given by 
and
The total charge Q that must leave the battery is then
Let us try to find a single equivalent capacitor that will hold the same charge Q at
the same voltage
It will have a capacitance 
given by
Combining the two previous equations, we have

[parallel] (19;5)
The net effect of connecting capacitors in parallel is thus to increase the capaci-
tance. Connecting capacitors in parallel is essentially increasing the area of the
plates where charge can accumulate (see, for example, Eq. 17–8).
Capacitors can also be connected in series: that is, end to end as shown in
Fig. 19–18. A charge 
flows from the battery to one plate of

flows
to one plate of
