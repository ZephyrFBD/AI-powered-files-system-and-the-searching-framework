 6. In a study of bacterial communities, researchers investigated interactions among naturally occurring strains of 
Vibrio bacteria. The researchers found that some Vibrio bacteria secrete antimicrobial substances that inhibit the 
growth and reproduction of other bacteria (antagonism). The researchers also found that some strains of Vibrio 
bacteria produce no antimicrobial substances themselves but instead live in close proximity to other bacteria that 
produce antimicrobial substances to which they are not susceptible (cooperation). 
  By testing approximately 35,000 pairs of naturally occurring strains of Vibrio bacteria, the researchers identified 
830 antagonistic interactions among genetically related Vibr
