aken to limit their manufacture and use. A major step was the signing in 1987 of 
the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer, in which par-
ticipating nations agreed to reduce CFC production. More stringent limits were set 
in 1992, when representatives of approximately 100 nations agreed to ban the pro-
duction and use of CFCs by 1996, with some exceptions for “essential uses.” Since 
then, the production of CFCs has indeed dropped precipitously. Images such as that 
shown in Figure 18.7 taken annually reveal that the depth and size of the ozone hole 
has begun to slowly decline. Nevertheless, because CFCs are unreactive and because 
they diffuse so slowly into the stratosphere, scientists estimate that it will take many 
decades for ozone concentrations in the stratosphere to return to pre-1980 levels. 
What substances have replaced CFCs? At this time, the main alternatives are hydro-
fluorocarbons (HFCs), compounds in which C¬H bonds replace the C¬Cl bonds of
