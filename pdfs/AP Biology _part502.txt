istories
Some species are opportunistic; they reproduce rapidly when the
environment is uncrowded and resources are vast. They are referred to as
r-strategists. Other organisms, the K-strategists, live in a dense
population near the carrying capacity (K), where the competition is fierce.
Table 12.1 compares the two life strategies.

r-strategists are organisms that sometimes undergo a big bang
pattern of reproduction. An example of this in the plant kingdom is
the agave (century plant), which grows for many years in the desert,
accumulating resources and waiting for the “right moment.” In an
unusually wet year, it suddenly sends up a large flowering stalk,
produces seed
