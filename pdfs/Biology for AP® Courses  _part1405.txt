y years
later, based on his reported outcomes and analysis of the
inheritance of a single characteristic, Mendel developed
the concepts of genes, their alleles, and dominance. These
concepts are defined in the second column of the table
using conventional symbols for the dominant allele for
each characteristic. Even later, the location of each of
these genes on one of the seven chromosomes in P.
sativum were determined, as shown in the third column.
A. Before the acceptance of what Mendel called “factors”
as the discrete units of inheritance, the accepted model was
that the traits of progeny were “blended” traits of the
parents. Evaluate the evidence provided by Mendel’s
experiments in disproving the blending theory of
inheritance.
B. Mendel published experimental data and analysis for
two experiments involving the inheritance of more than a
single characteristic. He examined two-character
inheritance of seed shape and seed color. He also reported
three-character inheritance of seed sh
