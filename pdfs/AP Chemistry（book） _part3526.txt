forms one oxyacid, HOF
. Because the electronegativity of fluorine is greater than that 
of oxygen, we must consider fluorine to be in a -1 oxidation state and oxygen to be in the 0 oxi-
dation state in this compound.

with the increasing oxidation state of the central halogen atom. 
 (Section 16.10) 
All the oxyacids are strong oxidizing agents. The oxyanions, formed on removal of H+ 
from the oxyacids, are generally more stable than the oxyacids. Hypochlorite salts are 
used as bleaches and disinfectants because of the powerful oxidizing capabilities of the 
ClO -  ion. Chlorate salts are similarly very reactive. For example, potassium chlorate is 
used to make matches and fireworks.
