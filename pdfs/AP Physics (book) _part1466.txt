Gas diffusion is important too. Plants require carbon dioxide for photosyn-

(stomata). As 
is utilized by the cells, its concentration drops below that in
the air outside, and more diffuses inward. Water vapor and oxygen produced by
the cells diffuse outward into the air.
Animals also exchange oxygen and

required for energy-producing reactions and must diffuse into cells.
is 
produced as an end product of many metabolic reactions and must diffuse out of
cells. But diffusion is slow over longer distances, so only the smallest organisms in
the animal world could survive without having developed complex respiratory and
circulatory systems. In humans, oxygen is taken into the lungs, where it diffuses
short distances across lung tissue and into the blood. Then the blood circulates 
it to cells throughout the body. The blood also carries
