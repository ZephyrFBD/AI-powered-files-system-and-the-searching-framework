e repulsion from the 
ligands and, therefore, do not all have the same energy under the influence of the octa-
hedral crystal-field. To see why, we must consider the shapes of the d orbitals and how 
their lobes are oriented relative to the ligands.
Figure 23.28 shows that the lobes of the dz2 and dx2 - y2 orbitals are directed along 
the x-, y-, and z-axes and so point directly toward the ligand point charges. The lobes of 
the dxy, dxz, and dyz orbitals, however, are directed between the axes and so do not point 
directly toward the charges. The result of this difference in orientation—dx2 - y2 and dz2 
lobes point directly toward the ligand charges; dxy, dxz, and dyz lobes do not—is that an 
electron residing in either the dx2 - y2 or dz2 orbitals feels more repulsion from the nega-
tively charged ligands. Hence the energy of the dx2 - y2 and dz2 orbitals is higher than the 
energy of the dxy, dxz, and dyz orbitals. This difference in energy is represented by the red 
boxes in the e
