ty of a gas kept at constant temperature. If either the pressure
or volume of a fixed amount of gas is allowed to vary, the other variable also
changes so that the product PV remains constant.
Temperature also affects the volume of a gas, but a quantitative relationship
between V and T was not found until more than a century after Boyle’s work.
The Frenchman Jacques Charles (1746–1823) found that when the pressure is not
too high and is kept constant, the volume of a gas increases with temperature at 
a nearly linear rate, as shown in Fig. 13–15a. However, all gases liquefy at low
temperatures (for example, oxygen liquefies at 
), so the graph cannot be
extended below the liquefaction point. Nonetheless, the graph is essentially a
straight line and if projected to lower temperatures, as shown by the dashed line,
it crosses the axis at about 
Such a graph can be drawn for any gas, and a straight line results which
always projects back to 
at zero volume. This seems to imply that if a ga
