neration. 6. When the second generation plants are
mature, score the trait a second time.
 
7. Compile the data and present them in a graph, such as a histogram.
Part II: Further Investigation of a Trait
Design an experiment to investigate a different trait or further investigate some aspect of the trait you selected for in
part I. For example, if you investigated trichomes in part I, consider investigating what, if any, advantage trichomes
contribute to the survival or reproductive success of the plant.
Investigation 2: Modeling Evolution
The goal of this investigation is to create a mathematical model of evolution. You enter data into a spreadsheet,
make “what if” changes in the data, and observe the results. By doing this, you discover the variables that influence
evolution and what kind of influence those variables have. Ultimately, you confirm that Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium describes a population that is not evolving; deviations from equilibrium indicate that the population is
ev
