ion of endocytosis that imports macromolecules that the cell needs from the extracellular fluid
detaching of the cell membrane from the cell wall and constriction of the cell membrane when a plant cell is
in a hypertonic solution
variation of pinocytosis that uses a different coating protein (caveolin) on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma
membrane
active transport that moves ions or small molecules across a membrane and may create a
difference in charge across that membrane
active transport mechanism that works against electrochemical gradients
variation of endocytosis that involves the use of specific binding proteins in the
plasma membrane for specific molecules or particles, and clathrin-coated pits that become clathrin-coated vesicles
movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary
active transport
characteristic of a membrane that allows some substances through but not others
substance dissolved in a liquid to form a solution
transporter th
