Eukaryotic cells possess many features that prokaryotic cells lack, including a nucleus with a double membrane that
encloses DNA. In addition, eukaryotic cells tend to be larger and have a variety of membrane-bound organelles that
perform specific, compartmentalized functions. Evidence supports the hypothesis that eukaryotic cells likely evolved
from prokaryotic ancestors; for example, mitochondria and chloroplasts feature characteristics of independently-living
prokaryotes. Eukaryotic cells come in all shapes, sizes, and types (e.g. animal cells, plant cells, and different types of cells
in the body). (Hint: This a rare instance where you should create a list of organelles and their respective functions because
later you will focus on how
