farming practices and the respiration and methane production. This is another example of how human activity indirectly
affects biogeochemical cycles in a significant way. Although much of the debate about the future effects of increasing
atmospheric carbon on climate change focuses on fossils fuels, scientists take natural processes, such as volcanoes and
respiration, into account as they model and predict the future impact of this increase.
The Nitrogen Cycle
Getting nitrogen into the living world is difficult. Plants and phytoplankton are not equipped to incorporate nitrogen from
the atmosphere (which exists as tightly bonded, triple covalent N2) even though this molecule comprises approximately
78 percent of the atmosphere. Nitrogen enters the living world via free-living and symbiotic bacteria, which incorporate
nitrogen into their macromolecules through nitrogen fixation (conversion of N2). Cyanobacteria live in most aquatic
ecosystems where sunlight is present; they play a key ro
