 new types of particles similar to the neutron
and proton were discovered, as well as many “midsized” particles called mesons
whose masses were mostly less than nucleon masses but more than the electron
mass. (Other mesons, found later, have masses greater than nucleons.) Physicists
felt that these particles could not all be fundamental, and must be made up of
even smaller constituents (later confirmed by experiment), which were given the
name quarks.
By the term fundamental particle, we mean a particle that is so simple, so
basic, that it has no internal structure† (is not made up of smaller subunits)—see
Chapter-Opening Question 1.
Today, the fundamental constituents of matter are considered to be quarks (they
make up protons and neutrons as well as mesons) and leptons (a class that includes
electrons, positrons, and neutrinos). There are also the “carriers of force” known
as gauge bosons, including the photon, gluons, and W and Z bosons. In addition
there is the elusive Higgs boson,
