The Quadratic Formula
We sometimes encounter equations that involve an unknown, say x, that appears
not only to the first power, but squared as well. Such a quadratic equation can
be written in the general form
The quantities a, b, and c are typically numbers or constants that are given.† The
general solutions to such an equation are given by the quadratic formula:
