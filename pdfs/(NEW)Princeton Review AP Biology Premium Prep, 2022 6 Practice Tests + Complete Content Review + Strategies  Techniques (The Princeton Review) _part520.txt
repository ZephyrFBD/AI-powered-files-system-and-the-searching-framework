DNA. Choice (C), cholesterol, is a steroid and therefore does not undergo hydrolysis.
Dipeptides, (D), could result from the hydrolysis of proteins, which are composed of polypeptides.

B
Phospholipids have a long fatty acid tail and a polar head group. The fatty acid tails associate in the
membrane, and the phospholipid head group associates with water at the boundary of the membrane.
Nucleotides, (A), are mostly polar and found in DNA and RNA. Water, (C), is polar and not found in
plasma membranes. Amino acids, (D), are zwitterionic, that is, they have both a positive and a negative
charge. Free amino acids are not found in the membrane.

C
(CH2O)3 = C18H36O18, as in (A), but the dehydration reactions to produce two glycosidic bonds between
the three monosaccharides would remove two H2O molecules, or four hydrogens and two oxygens.
Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

All isotopes of hydrogen will contain one proton, by definition. All atoms that have only one proton are
