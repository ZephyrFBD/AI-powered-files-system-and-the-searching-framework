he Doppler effect occurs for waves other than sound. Light and other types 
of electromagnetic waves (such as for radar) exhibit the Doppler effect: although
the formulas for the frequency shift are not identical to Eqs. 12–2 and 12–3,
the effect is similar (see Chapter 33). One important application is for 
weather forecasting using radar. The time delay between the emission of a radar 
pulse and its reception after being reflected off raindrops gives the position of
precipitation. Measuring the Doppler shift in frequency (as in Example 12–16)
tells how fast the storm is moving and in which direction. “Radar guns”used by police
work similarly, measuring a car’s speed by the Doppler shift of electromagnetic waves.
Another important application is to astronomy, where the velocities of galaxies
can be estimated from the Doppler shift. Light from distant galaxies is shifted
toward lower frequencies, indicating that the galaxies are moving away from us.
This is called the redshift since re
