Although eukaryotic cells have many organelles in common, they also
have organelles that are unique to each cell type, such as cell walls in plant
cells. Figure 3.4 shows a typical plant cell.

The human body consists of approximately two hundred different cell
types, each with a different function and, therefore, a different form.
Although different cell types have different appearances, they all contain

Nucleolus
The nucleus of a nondividing cell contains one or more prominent
nucleoli, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is synthesized according to
instructions from the DNA. Large and small subunits of ribosomes are also
assembled there. A nucleolus combines proteins imported from the
cytoplasm with rRNA made in the nucleolus. Nucleoli are not membrane-
bound structures but are actually a tangle of chromatin
