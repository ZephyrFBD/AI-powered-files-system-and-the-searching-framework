If the plant has receptors on guard cell membranes, it can
increase its rate of photosynthesis by closing its stomata in
response to light.

4. Researchers examined diﬀerent methods of growing pineapples
in Benin, Africa, to understand why some methods yielded larger
pineapples than others. The figures below show two experiments.
In both cases, plants were either artificially induced to flower
(artificial flowering induction) or allowed to flower naturally
(natural flowering induction). Additionally, the
