al reagents. Only in a chiral envi-
ronment do they behave differently from each other. One interesting property of chiral 
substances is that their solutions may rotate the plane of polarized light, as explained in 
Section 23.4.
Chirality is common in organic compounds. It is often not observed, however, 
because when a chiral substance is synthesized in a typical reaction, the two enantio-
mers are formed in precisely the same quantity. The resulting mixture is called a racemic 
mixture, and it does not rotate the plane of polarized light because the two forms rotate 
the light to equal extents in opposite directions. 
 (Section 23.4)
Many drugs are chiral compounds. When a drug is administered as a racemic 
mixture, often only one enantiomer has beneficial results. The other is often inert, or 
nearly so, or may even have a harmful effect. For example, the drug (R)-albuterol (Fig-
ure 24.15(a)) is a bronchodilator used to relieve the symptoms of asthma. The enantio-
mer (S)-albuter
