er degrades.
d.
The movement does not require light once it is
set and it will eventually slow down, suggesting
that a “clock” molecule is degraded over time.

A student randomly chose 40 tobacco seeds of the same
species from a packet. He placed 20 seeds on moist paper
towels in each of two petri dishes. He wrapped dish A
completely in an opaque cover to exclude all light. He did
not wrap dish B. He placed the dishes equidistant from a
light source set to a cycle of 14 hours of light and 10 hours
of dark. All other conditions were the same for the two
dishes. He examined the dishes after 7 days, and
permanently removed the opaque cover from dish A. This
table shows the student’s data. The most probable cause
for the difference in mean stem length between plants in
dish A and plants in dish B is ____.
a.
shortening of cells in the stem in response to the
lack of light
b.
elongation of the stem in response to the lack of
light
c.
enhancement of stem elongation by light
d.
genetic di
