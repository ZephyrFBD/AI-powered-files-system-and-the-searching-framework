The more water there is in a solution, the higher its water potential will be. The less water there is in a solution, the
lower its water potential will be. Water flows from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water potential.
This is similar to how a ball at the top of a hill, which has higher potential energy, will roll down a hill to an area of
lower potential energy. (See Figure 6.1.)

TIP
Remember, hypertonic solutions have more solute and less water, so their water potential is lower. Hypotonic solutions have less solute and more
water, so their water potential is higher.
Water potential focuses on the concentration of water in a solution. If there is more solute in a solution, the water
is less concentrated in that solution. A hypertonic solution that has more solute will have less concentrated water and
a lower water potential. A hypotonic solution has less solute and therefore more concentrated water and a higher
water potent
