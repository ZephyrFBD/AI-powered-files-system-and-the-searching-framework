duct are called 
precipitation reactions. A precipitate is an insoluble solid formed by a reaction 
in solution. In Figure 4.4 the precipitate is lead iodide 1PbI22, a compound that has a very 
low solubility in water:
 
Pb1NO3221aq2 + 2 KI1aq2 ยก PbI21s2 + 2 KNO31aq2 
[4.3]
The other product of this reaction, potassium nitrate 1KNO32, remains in solution.
Precipitation reactions occur when pairs of oppositely charged ions attract each 
other so strongly that they form an insoluble ionic solid. To predict whether certain 
combinations of ions form insoluble compounds, we must consider some guidelines 
concerning the solubilities of common ionic compounds.
Solubility Guidelines for Ionic Compounds
The solubility of a substance at a given temperature is the amount of the substance that 
can be dissolved in a given quantity of solvent at the given temperature. Any substance
