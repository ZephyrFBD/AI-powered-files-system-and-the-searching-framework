tinct molecules located on the surface of the red blood cells. There
is a single gene locus at which two allelic variants are possible. A person
can be homozygous for one type of molecule (MM), be homozygous for
the other molecule (NN), or be hybrid and have both molecules (MN) on
their red blood cells. The MN genotype is not intermediate between M and
N phenotypes. Both M and N traits are expressed because both molecules
are present on the surface of the red blood cells; see Figure 8.4.

Multiple Alleles
Many genes in a population exist in only two allelic forms. For example,
pea plants can be either tall (T) or short (t). When there are more than two
allelic forms of a gene, that is referred to as multiple alleles. In humans
there are four different blood types: A, B, AB, and O determined by the
presence of specific molecules on the surface of the red blood cells. There
are three alleles, A, B, and O, which determine the four different blood
types. A and B are c
