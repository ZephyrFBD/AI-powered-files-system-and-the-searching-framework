Parallel rays of monochromatic light pass through the narrow slit as shown in
Fig. 24–20a. The slit width D is on the order of the wavelength 
of the light, but
the slit’s length (into and out of page) may be large compared to 
The light falls
on a screen which is assumed to be very far away, so the rays heading toward any
point are very nearly parallel before they meet at the screen. First we consider
rays that pass straight through as in Fig. 24–20a. They are all in phase, so there
will be a central bright spot on the screen (see Fig. 24–19c). In Fig. 24–20b, we
consider rays moving at an angle such that the ray from the top of the slit travels
exactly one wavelength farther than the ray from the bottom edge to reach the
screen. The ray passing through the very center
