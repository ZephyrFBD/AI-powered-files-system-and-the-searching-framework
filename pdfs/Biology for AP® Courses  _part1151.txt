ce into G0 and await further signals when conditions improve.
The G2 Checkpoint
The G2 checkpoint bars entry into the mitotic phase if certain conditions are not met. As at the G1 checkpoint, cell size
and protein reserves are assessed. However, the most important role of the G2 checkpoint is to ensure that all of the
chromosomes have been replicated and that the replicated DNA is not damaged. If the checkpoint mechanisms detect
problems with the DNA, the cell cycle is halted, and the cell attempts to either complete DNA replication or repair the
damaged DNA.
The M Checkpoint
The M checkpoint occurs near the end of the metaphase stage of karyokinesis. The M checkpoint is also known as
the spindle checkpoint, because it determines whether all the sister chromatids are correctly attached to the spindle
microtubules. Because the separation of the sister chromatids during anaphase is an irreversible step, the cycle will not
proceed until the kinetochores of each pair of sister chromatids a
