side. This separation of charge produces a dipole, the 
magnitude of which is given by the dipole moment, which is measured 
in debyes (D). Dipole moments increase with increasing amount of 
charge separated and increasing distance of separation. Any diatomic 
molecule X:Y in which X and Y have different electronegativities is 
a polar molecule.
Most bonding interactions lie between the extremes of cova-
lent and ionic bonding. While it is generally true that the bonding 
between a metal and a nonmetal is predominantly ionic, exceptions 
to this guideline are not uncommon when the difference in electro-
negativity of the atoms is relatively small or when the oxidation state 
of the metal becomes large.
DRAWING LEWIS STRUCTURES AND RESONANCE STRUCTURES 
(SECTIONS 8.5 AND 8.6) If we know which atoms are connected 
to one another, we can draw Lewis structures for molecules and ions 
by a simple procedure. Once we do so, we can determine the formal 
charge of each atom in a Lewis structure
