Draw the correct isomer.
 [24.89]  Indole smells terrible in high concentrations but has a 
pleasant floral-like odor when highly diluted. Its structure is
N
H
The molecule is planar, and the nitrogen is a very weak 
base, with Kb = 2 * 10-12. Explain how this information 
indicates that the indole molecule is aromat
