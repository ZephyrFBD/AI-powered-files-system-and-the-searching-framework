n sustaining certain organisms. Density and temperature shape the structure of aquatic systems. Oceans
may be thought of as consisting of different zones based on water depth and distance from the shoreline and light
penetrance. Different kinds of organisms are adapted to the conditions found in each zone. Coral reefs are unique marine
ecosystems that are home to a wide variety of species. Estuaries are found where rivers meet the ocean; their shallow
waters provide nourishment and shelter for young crustaceans, mollusks, fishes, and many other species. Freshwater
biomes include lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, and wetlands. Bogs are an interesting type of wetland characterized by
standing water, lower pH, and a lack of nitrogen.
35.5 Climate and the Effects of Global Climate Change
The Earth has gone through periodic cycles of increases and decreases in temperature. During the past 2000 years, the
Medieval Climate Anomaly was a warmer period, while the Little Ice Age was unusually cool.
