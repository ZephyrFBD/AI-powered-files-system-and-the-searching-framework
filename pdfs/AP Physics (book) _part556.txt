distance of the Moon.
61. (II) Our Sun revolves about the center of our Galaxy
at a distance of about
light-
years
What is the period of the Sun’s orbital motion about the
center of the Galaxy?
62. (II) Table 5–3 gives the mean distance, period, and mass
for the four largest moons of Jupiter (those discovered by
Galileo in 1609). Determine the mass of Jupiter: (a) using
the data for Io; (b) using data for each of the other three
moons. Are the results consistent?

63. (II) Determine the mean distance from Jupiter for each of
Jupiter’s principal moons, using Kepler’s third law. Use the
distance of Io and the periods given in Table 5–3. Compare
your results to the values in Table 5–3.
64. (II) Planet A and planet B are in circular orbits around a
distant star. Planet A is 7.0 times farther from the star than
is planet B. What is the ratio of their speeds
