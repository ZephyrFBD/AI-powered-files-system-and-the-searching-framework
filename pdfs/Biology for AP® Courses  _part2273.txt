 bacteria is well known to microbiology students. These gene transfers
between species are the major mechanism whereby bacteria acquire resistance to antibiotics. Classically, this type of transfer
has been thought to occur by three different mechanisms:
1.
Transformation: naked DNA is taken up by a bacteria
2.
Transduction: genes are transferred using a virus
3.
Conjugation: the use a hollow tube called a pilus to transfer genes between organisms
More recently, a fourth mechanism of gene transfer between prokaryotes has been discovered. Small, virus-like particles
called gene transfer agents (GTAs) transfer random genomic segments from one species of prokaryote to another. GTAs
have been shown to be responsible for genetic changes, sometimes at a very high frequency compared to other evolutionary
processes. The first GTA was characterized in 1974 using purple, non-sulfur bacteria. These GTAs, which are thought to be
bacteriophages that lost the ability to reproduce on their own, carry
