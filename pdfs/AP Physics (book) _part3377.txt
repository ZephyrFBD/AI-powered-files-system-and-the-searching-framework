30–9 Calculations Involving Decay
Rates and Half-Life
Let us now consider Examples of what we can determine about a sample of
radioactive material if we know the half-life.
Sample activity. The isotope 
has a half-life of 5730 yr.
If a sample contains 
carbon-14 nuclei, what is the activity of the
sample?
APPROACH We first use the half-life to find the decay constant (Eq. 30–6),
and use that to find the activity, Eq. 30–3b. The number of seconds in a year is
SOLUTION The decay constant from Eq. 30–6 is
From Eqs. 30–3b and 30–5, the activity or rate of decay is
Notice that the graph of Fig. 30–10b starts at this value, corresponding to the
original value of
nuclei in Fig. 30–10a.
NOTE The unit “decays/s” is often written simply as 
since “decays” is not a
unit but refers only to the n
