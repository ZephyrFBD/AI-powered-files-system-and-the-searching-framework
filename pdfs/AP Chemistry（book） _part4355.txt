ls with the same set of quantum 
numbers n and l. For example, we speak of the 2p subshell 
1n = 2, l = 12, which is composed of three orbitals (2px, 2py, and  
2pz). (Section 6.5)
substitutional alloy An alloy formed when atoms of the solute 
in a solid solution occupy positions normally occupied by a 
solvent atom. (Section 23.6)
substitution reactions Reactions in which one atom (or group 
of atoms) replaces another atom (or group) within a molecule; 
substitution reactions are typical for alkanes and aromatic 
hydrocarbons. (Section 24.3)
substrate A substance that undergoes a reaction at the active 
site in an enzyme. (Section 14.7)
supercritical fluid The state that exists when liquid and gas 
phases are indistinguishable from each other as the temperature 
exceeds the critical temperature and the pressure exceeds the 
critical pressure. (Section 11.4)
supercritical mass An amount of fissionable material larger 
than the critical mass. (Section 21.7)
supersaturated solution A sol
