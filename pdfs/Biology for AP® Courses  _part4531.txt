have been selected by stable, predictable
environments, therefore they do not feel the need
to care for their offspring like wolves.
b.
Frogs use very little energy to produce large
numbers of offspring, therefore they do not have
enough remaining to nurture them.
c.
Smaller animals like frogs do not care for their
offspring as a lot of them are produced whereas
larger animals like wolves only produce a few.
d.
Frogs expend a lot of energy to produce large
numbers of offspring, therefore they do not have
enough to nurture them.
64. Explain which features of a logistic growth curve are
the same for every population exhibiting logistic growth
and which features might vary from one population to
another.
a.
The overall S-shape would be the same for all
populations. The actual x-y values on the graphs,
population numbers corresponding to starting
populations, and the ending carrying capacities
could differ.
b.
The overall carrying capacities would be the
same for all populations. The actua
