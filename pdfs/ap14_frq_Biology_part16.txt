ors during DNA replication. The 
team claims that this will eliminate genetic variation in the engineered flies. A second research team claims that 
eliminating errors during DNA replication will not entirely eliminate genetic variation in the engineered flies. 
(a) Provide ONE piece of evidence that would indicate new genetic variation has occurred in the engineered 
flies. 
(b) Describe ONE mechanism that could lead to genetic variation in the engineered strain of flies. 
(c) Describe how genetic variation in a population contributes to the process of evolution in the population.
