, 
 
 so I am, disgraced. My daughters can’t wash theirselves of a Friday night 
 
 without the whole world gawking in the window and them boys there 
 
 189 
 
 are in a state of sin and should be taken to the priest for confession 
 
 before their Confirmation tomorrow. 
 
 But Mam says, I don’t know about the rest of the world but I saved 
 
 a whole year for Frank’s Confirmation suit and I’m not going to the 
 
 priest to have him tell me my son is not fit for Confirmation so that I’ll 
 
 have to wait another year when he grows out of this suit and all because 
 
  
  
 he climbed a spout for an innocent gawk at the scrawny arse of Mona 
 
 Dooley. 
 
 She drags me home by the ear and makes me kneel before the Pope. 
 
 Swear, she says, swear to that Pope that you didn’t look at Mona Dooley 
 
 in her pelt. 
 
 I swear. 
 
 If you’re lying you won’t be in a state of grace for Confirmation 
 
 tomorrow and that’s the worst kind of sacrilege. 
 
 I swear. 
 
 Only the bishop himself
