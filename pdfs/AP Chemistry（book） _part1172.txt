bond length in this molecule is d1, 
and the four A ¬ X bond lengths are each d2. (a) In terms of 
d1 and d2, how could you define the bonding atomic radii of 
atoms A and X? (b) In terms of d1 and d2, what would you pre-
dict for the X¬X bond length of an X2 molecule? [Section 7.3]

 (a)  
Are all of the subshells for n = 1, n = 2, and n = 3 
shown? If not, what is missing?
 
(b)  
The 2s and 2p energy levels are different. Which of the 
following is the best explanation for why this is the case? 
(i) The 2s and 2p energy levels have different energies in 
the hydrogen atom, so of course they will have different 
energies in the sodium atom, (ii) The energy of the 2p 
orbital is higher than that of the 2s in all many-electron 
atoms. (iii) The 2s level in Na has electrons in it, whereas 
the 2p does not.
 
(c)  
Which of the energy levels holds the highest-energy elec-
tron in a sodium atom?
