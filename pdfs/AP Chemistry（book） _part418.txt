ed. We can place the coefficient 3
2 in front of O2  
to give four O atoms in the reactants 13
2 * 2 = 3 O atoms in 3
2 O22:
CH3OH1l2 + 3
2 O21g2 ¡ CO21g2 + 2 H2O1g2
Although this equation is balanced, it is not in its most conven-
tional form because it contains a fractional coefficient. However, 
multiplying through by 2 removes the fraction and keeps the 
equation balanced:
2 CH3OH1l2 + 3 O21g2 ¡ 2 CO21g2 + 4 H2O1g2
3.3 ∣ Formula Weights
Chemical formulas and chemical equations both have a quantitative significance in that 
the subscripts in formulas and the coefficients in equations represent precise quantities. 
The formula H2O indicates that a molecule of this substance (water) contains exactly two 
*When there is an insufficient quantity of O2 present, carbon monoxide (CO) is produced along 
with CO2; this is called incomplete combustion. If the quantity of O2 is severely restricted, the fine 
particles of carbon we call soot are produced. Complete combustion produces only CO2 a
