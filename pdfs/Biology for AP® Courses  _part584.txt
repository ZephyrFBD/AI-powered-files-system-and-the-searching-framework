requires free energy. The sodium-potassium pump, which maintains electrochemical gradients across the membranes of
nerve cells in animals, is an example of primary active transport. The formation of H+ gradients by secondary active
transport (co-transport) is important in cellular respiration and photosynthesis and moving glucose into cells.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined in Big
Idea 2 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The learning objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP® exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science pra
