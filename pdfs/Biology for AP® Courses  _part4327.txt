Populations are dynamic entities. Populations consist all of the species living within a specific area, and populations
fluctuate based on a number of factors: seasonal and yearly changes in the environment, natural disasters such as forest
fires and volcanic eruptions, and competition for resources between and within species. The statistical study of population
dynamics, demography, uses a series of mathematical tools to investigate how populations respond to changes in their
biotic and abiotic environments. Many of these tools were or
