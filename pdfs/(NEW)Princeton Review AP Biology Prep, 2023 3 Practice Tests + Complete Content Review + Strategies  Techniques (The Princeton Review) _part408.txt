 the number of individuals with the dominant phenotype
includes those with the homozygous dominant genotype and those with the
heterozygous genotype.
Both of these equations are listed on the AP Biology Equations and Formulas sheet. But how do you use them? Use
proportions in the population to figure out both the allele and genotype frequencies. Let’s calculate the frequency of
the genotype for green-eyed fruit flies. If 9% of the fruit flies are green-eyed, then the genotype frequency, q2, is
0.09. You can now use this value to figure out the frequency of the recessive allele in the population. The allele
frequency for green eyes is equal to the square root of 0.09—that’s 0.3. If the recessive allele is 0.3, the dominant
allele must be 0.7. That’s because 0.3 + 0.7 equals 1.
Using the second equation, you can calculate the genotypes of the homozygous dominants and the heterozygotes.
The frequency for the homozygous dominants, p2, is 0.7 × 0.7, which equals 0.49. The frequency for the
