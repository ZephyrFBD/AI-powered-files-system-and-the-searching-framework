Figure 28.9 Hormonal regulation of the female reproductive system involves hormones from the hypothalamus,
pituitary, and ovaries.
In addition to producing FSH and LH, the anterior portion of the pituitary gland also produces the hormone prolactin (PRL)
in females. Prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands following childbirth. Prolactin levels are
regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH) and prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH),
which is now known to be dopamine. PRH stimulates the release of prolactin and PIH inhibits it.
The posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth. The uterine
smooth muscles are not very sensitive to oxytocin until late in pregna
