es when resources such as food, territories, and mates
that two or more individuals depend upon become limited. Direct
competition occurs when individuals compete for the same resource (for
example, two males competing to mate with a single female), and
indirect competition occurs when organisms use the same resource (for
example, a waterhole) but may not interact with each other. The use of
resources by one individual decreases the availability for use by others,
so the less competitive individual will be forced to go elsewhere, resulting
in competitive exclusion. When sunlight is limited, plants unable to
outgrow surrounding plants may use energy to produce many seeds in
order to spread their oﬀspring to areas with more sunlight. Species may
coexist if intraspecific competition is stronger than interspecific
competition because then each species limits their own growth and
population size.
In addition to cooperation and competition, ecological relationships that
