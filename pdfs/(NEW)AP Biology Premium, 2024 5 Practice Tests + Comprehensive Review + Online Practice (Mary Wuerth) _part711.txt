36. Rinderpest is a viral disease that affects cattle and wildebeests on the plains of the Serengeti in Africa. In the
1950s, a vaccine against rinderpest became available, and the number of wildebeests on the plains of the
Serengeti increased. As the number of wildebeests increased, park rangers found that more grass was eaten by
the wildebeests, and the number of wildfires in the area decreased. The decrease in frequency of wildfires led
to increased tree density in the area. This increased tree density led to greater biodiversity of species in the
area. Based on this information, what role in t
