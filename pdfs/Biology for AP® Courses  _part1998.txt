ent must not be understood to mean that individual organisms
evolve. The statement is shorthand for “a population evolves in response to a changing environment.” However, a
second misunderstanding may arise by interpreting the statement to mean that the evolution is somehow intentional.
A changed environment results in some individuals in the population, those with particular phenotypes, benefiting and
therefore producing proportionately more offspring than other phenotypes. This results in change in the population if the
characteristics are genetically determined.
It is also important to understand that the variation that natural selection works on is already in a population and does not
arise in response to an environmental change. For example, applying antibiotics to a population of bacteria will, over time,
select a population of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. The resistance, which is caused by a gene, did not arise by
mutation because of the application of the antibio
