at an X chromosome (maternally or paternally derived) is inactivated in each cell is random, but once the
inactivation occurs, all cells derived from that one will have the same inactive X chromosome or Barr body. By this
process, females compensate for their double genetic dose of X chromosome. In so-called “tortoiseshell” cats, embryonic X
inactivation is observed as color variegation (Figure 13.9). Females that are heterozygous for an X-linked coat color gene
will express one of two different coat colors over different regions of their body, corresponding to whichever X chromosome
is inactivated in the embryonic cell progenitor of that region.
Figure 13.9 In cats, the gene for coat color is located on the X chromosome. In the embryonic development of female
cats, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated in each cell, resulting in a tortoiseshell pattern if the cat
has two different alleles for coat color. Male cats, having only one X chromosome, never exhibit a tortoises
