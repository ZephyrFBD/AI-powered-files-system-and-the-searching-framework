tron acquires 
of kinetic energy
when it is accelerated by an electric field from plate A to
plate B. What is the potential difference between the plates,
and which plate is at the higher potential?
6. (I) How strong is the electric field between two parallel
plates 6.8 mm apart if the potential difference between
them is 220 V?
7. (I) An electric field of 525
is desired between two
parallel plates 11.0 mm apart. How large a voltage should
be applied?
8. (I) The electric field between two parallel plates connected
to a 45-V battery is 1900
How far apart are the 
plates?
9. (I) What potential difference is needed to give a helium
nucleus 
85.0 keV of kinetic energy?
10. (II) Two parallel plates, connected to a 45-V power supply,
are separated by an air gap. How small can the gap be if the
air is not to become conducting by exceeding its breakdown
value of
11. (II) The work done by an external force to move a
charge from point A to point B is 
If the charge
was started from rest and had
