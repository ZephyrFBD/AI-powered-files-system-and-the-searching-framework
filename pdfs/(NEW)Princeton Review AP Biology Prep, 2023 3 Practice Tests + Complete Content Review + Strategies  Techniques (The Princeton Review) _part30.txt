Questions 23–26 refer to the following passage.
Proteins often need the equivalent of a shipping label so that they can be sent intracellularly or
extracellularly to the correct location. These labels are typically found in three forms: signal
sequences, target signals, or localization signals. A signal sequence is a stretch of hydrophobic
amino acid residue that is only located within polypeptides destined to fold into EITHER
extracellular proteins, i
