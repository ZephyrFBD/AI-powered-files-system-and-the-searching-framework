‡The Society of Automotive Engineers assigns numbers to represent the viscosity of oils: 30-weight
(SAE 30) is more viscous than 10-weight. Multigrade oils, such as 20–50, are designed to maintain
viscosity as temperature increases; 20–50 means the oil acts like 20-weight when cool and is like 
50-weight when it is
