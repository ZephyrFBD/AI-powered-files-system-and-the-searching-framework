lativity which represents
our most complete understanding of gravitation. Many other aspects of physics
are involved, from electromagnetism and thermodynamics to atomic and nuclear
physics as well as elementary particles. General Relativity serves also as the
foundation for modern cosmology, which is the study of the universe as a whole.
Cosmology deals especially with the search for a theoretical framework to under-
stand the observed universe, its origin, and its future. The questions posed by
cosmology are profound and difficult; the possible answers stretch the imagina-
tion. They are questions like “Has the universe always existed, or did it have
a beginning in time?” Either alternative is difficult to imagine: time going back
indefinitely into the past, or an actual moment when the universe began (but,
