chestnuts) with each having a good chance
to germinate into a new organism; plants with high fecundity usually have many small, energy-poor seeds (like orchids)
that have a relatively poor chance of surviving. Although it may seem that coconuts and chestnuts have a better chance
of surviving, the energy tradeoff of the orchid is also very effective. It is a matter of where the energy is used, for large
numbers of seeds or for fewer seeds with more energy.
Early versus Late Reproduction
The timing of reproduction in a life history also affects species survival. Organisms that reproduce at an early age have
a greater chance of producing offspring, but this is usually at the expense of their growth and the maintenance of their
health. Conversely, organisms that start reproducing later in life often have greater fecundity or are better able to provide
parental care, but they risk that they will not survive to reproductive age. Examples of this can be seen in fishes. Small
fish like guppies
