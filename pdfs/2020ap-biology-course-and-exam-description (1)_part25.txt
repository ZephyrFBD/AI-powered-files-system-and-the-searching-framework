Introduction 
Given the speed with which scientific discoveries and 
research continuously expand scientific knowledge, 
many educators are faced with the challenge of 
balancing breadth of content coverage with depth 
of understanding. The AP Biology course outlined 
in this framework embraces this challenge by 
deemphasizing a traditional “content coverage” 
model of instruction in favor of one that focuses 
on enduring, conceptual understandings and the 
content that supports them. This approach enables 
students to spend less time on factual recall and 
more time on
