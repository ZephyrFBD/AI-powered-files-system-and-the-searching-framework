Figure 32.13 The urea cycle converts ammonia to urea.
Excretion of Nitrogenous Waste
The theory of evolution proposes that life started in an aquatic environment. It is not surprising to see
that biochemical pathways like the urea cycle evolved to adapt to a changing environment when terrestrial
life forms evolved. Arid conditions probably led to the evolution of the uric acid pathway as a means of
conserving water.

ammonia and K+ only
