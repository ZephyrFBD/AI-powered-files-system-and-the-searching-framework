ex transfers protons across the
thylakoid membrane and transfers electrons
from PS-I to PS-II. The products of the light
dependent reaction are used to power the Calvin
cycle to produce glucose.
d.
When photons strike photosystem (PS) II,
pigments pass the light energy to chlorophyll
molecules that excite electrons, which is then
passed to the electron transport chain. The
cytochrome complex transfers protons across the
thylakoid membrane and transfers electrons
from PS II to PS I. The products of the light
independent reaction are used to power the
Calvin cycle to produce glucose.
26. Explain why X-rays and ultraviolet light wavelengths
are dangerous to living tissues.
a.
UV and X-rays are high energy waves that
penetrate the tissues and damage cells.
b.
UV and X-rays are low energy waves that
penetrate the tissues and damage cells.
c.
UV and X-rays cannot penetrate tissues and thus
damage the cells.
d.
UV and X-rays can penetrate tissues and thus do
not damage the cells.
