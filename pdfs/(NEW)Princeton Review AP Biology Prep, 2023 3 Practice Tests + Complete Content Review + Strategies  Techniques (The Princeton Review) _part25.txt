 appears pure white. Expression of
Fursilla (frsl) depends on the binding/lack of binding of several proteins: Nefur (NEFR), Lesfur
(LSFR), and Dirkfur (DRKFR). Figure 2 shows the relative levels of frsl transcript as measured
via RT-qPCR when each protein is overexpressed or unexpressed in the cell.

12. Scientists identified a mutant allele of the Fursilla gene caused by a deletion of bases 1231â€“1295 on
chromosome 8. What is the likely effect of this mutation?
(A) No transcription and no translation of Fursilla will occur.
(B) Transcription will not occur, but translation will be unaffected.
(C) Transcription of Fursilla will occur, but no translation will occur.
(D) Both transcription and translation of Fursilla will be unaffected.
13. Which of the following would likely produce a dog with the darkest fur?
(A) High levels of LSFR and high levels of DRKFR
(B) High levels of LSFR and
