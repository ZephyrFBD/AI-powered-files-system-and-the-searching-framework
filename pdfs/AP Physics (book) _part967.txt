FIGURE 9–25 A beam sags, at least 
a little (but is exaggerated here), even 
under its own weight. The beam thus 
changes shape: the upper edge is 
compressed, and the lower edge is 
under tension (elongated). Shearing 
stress also occurs within the beam.
Reinforced concrete, in which iron rods are embedded in the concrete (Fig. 9–26),
is much stronger. But the concrete on the lower edge of a loaded beam still tends
to crack because it is weak under tension. This problem is solved with prestressed
concrete, which also contains iron rods or a wire mesh, but during the pouring of
the concrete, the rods or wire are held under tension. After the concrete dries,
the tension on the iron is released, putting the concrete under compression.
The amount of compressive stress is carefully predetermined so that when loads
are applied to the beam, the compression on the lower edge is never allowed 
to be reduced so far as to put the concrete into tension.
