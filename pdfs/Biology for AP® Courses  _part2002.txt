ulation over generations result in microevolution. However, macroevolution leads
to the evolution of new species when populations diverge from a common ancestor and, for one reason or another, become
reproductively isolated from the original population.
Speciation occurs along two main pathways: geographic separation (allopatric speciation) and through mechanisms that
occur within a shared habitat (sympatric speciation). In both cases, populations become reproductively isolated. When
populations become geographically isolated, the free-flow of alleles is prevented. Over time—and because of different
selective pressures—the populations diverge and become genetically independent species. Prezygotic barriers block
reproduction prior to formation of a zygote, whereas postzygotic barriers block reproduction after fertilization occurs.
Obviously, if two populations are separated by a vast ocean, they will not come in contact with each other to reproduce.
However, if speciation has occurred,
