2 = -0.120 using the ex or 
INV LN function of a calculator:
Because N0 = 1.000 g, we have:
Nt = 10.8872N0 = 10.887211.000 g2 = 0.887 g 
Solve 
(a) Equation 21.20 is solved for the decay constant, k, and then 
Equation 21.19 is used to calculate half-life, t1>2:
Solve Letâ€™s assume that the rock currently contains 1.000 mg  
of uranium-238 and therefore 0.257 mg of lead-206. The 
amount of uranium-238 in the rock when it was first formed 
therefore equals 1.000 mg plus the quantity that has decayed 
to lead-206. Because the mass of lead atoms is not the same as 
the mass of uranium atoms, we cannot just add 1.000 mg and 
0.257 mg. We have to multiply the present mass of lead-206 
(0.257 mg) by the ratio of the mass number of uranium to that 
of lead, into which it has decayed. Therefore, the original mass 
of 238
92U was
 Original 238
92U = 1.000 mg + 238
206 10.257 mg2
 = 1.297 mg
Using Equation 21.19, we can calculate the decay constant for the 
process from its half-life:
k =
