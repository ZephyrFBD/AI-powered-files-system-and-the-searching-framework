 be generalizable.
(B)
There was a net increase in biomass growth rate in some
plots but not in others. More research is needed to determine
whether there is a consistent pattern.
(C)
There is not a change in biomass growth rate in these
locations. More research is needed to determine whether
there is a change in underground biomass growth rate.

Population Dynamics
Ecology is the study of interactions between organisms and the
environments they inhabit. Organisms face the daily challenge of finding
nutrients (oȇen in the form of other organisms), safe havens, and mates.
Organisms must not only adjust to the abiotic (nonliving) factors
presented by the environment but also compete for resources with other
organisms while avoiding being eaten. There are many levels of
interaction between members of the same species, members of diﬀerent
species, and between species and the natural world around them.
Fortunately, the questions on the AP Biology exam about this hypothesis-
