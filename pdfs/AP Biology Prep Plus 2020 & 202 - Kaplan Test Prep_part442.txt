ctly into pyruvate decarboxylation and then the
Krebs cycle. Therefore, for each molecule of pyruvate consumed, 1
NADH would be generated through the oxidation reaction converting
pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. One round of the Krebs cycle would then
produce 3 molecules of NADH, 1 molecule of FADH2, and 1 molecule of
ATP. The NADH and FADH2 would then enter the electron transport
chain. where they would be used to generate more ATP. This best
matches (A). (B) is incorrect because NADH and FADH2 are made
during the Krebs cycle. NAD+ and FAD are regenerated through the
electron transport chain to allow the Krebs cycle to run continuously.
(C) and (D) are incorrect because the pyruvate would not go through
glycolysis since the purpose of glycolysis is to generate pyruvate from
glucose.

As photosynthesis occurs, the dense bicarbonate is converted to
oxygen, which aﬀects the buoyancy of the plant disc, allowing it to
rise. However, when the student accidentally shuts
