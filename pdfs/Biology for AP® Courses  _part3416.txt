ses antidiuretic hormone
production, which is a hormone that helps with
water loss.
c.
Drinking alcohol reduces thyroid stimulating
hormone production, which is a hormone that
helps retain water.
d.
Drinking alcohol increases thyroid stimulating
hormone production, which is a hormone that
helps with water loss.
42. Describe how gonadotropin-releasing hormone
production is controlled by a negative feedback loop.
a.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone decreases
production of follicle stimulating hormone,
which decreases hormone production in the
gonads. An increase in gonad hormone
production then inhibits gonadotropin-releasing
hormone production.
b.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulates
production of follicle stimulating hormone,
which regulates hormone production in the
gonads. An increase in gonad hormone
production then inhibits gonadotropin-releasing
hormone production.
c.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone decreases
production of luteinizing hormone, which
decreases hormone production
