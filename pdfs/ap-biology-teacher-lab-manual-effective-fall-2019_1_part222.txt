nges from 
one generation to the next. This model will let you explore parameters that affect allele 
frequencies, such as selection, mutation, and migration. 
The second part of the investigation asks you to generate your own questions 
regarding the evolution of allele frequencies in a population. Then you are asked to 
explore possible answers to those questions by applying more sophisticated computer 
models. These models are available for free.
This investigation also provides an opportunity for you to review concepts you 
might have studied previously, including natural selection as the major mechanism 
of evolution; the relationship among genotype, phenotype, and natural selection; and 
fundamentals of classic Mendelian genetics.

■ Learning Objectives 
•  EVO-1.K: Describe the conditions under which allele and genotype frequencies will 
change in populations.
