oxide buildup in the alveoli. There are two ways to keep
the alveolar ventilation constant: increase the respiratory rate while decreasing the tidal volume of air per breath (shallow

breathing), or decrease the respiratory rate while increasing the tidal volume per breath. In either case, the ventilation
remains the same, but the work done and type of work needed are quite different. Both tidal volume and respiratory rate are
closely regulated when oxygen demand increases.
There are two types of work conducted during respiration, flow-resistive and elastic work. Flow-resistive refers to the work
of the alveoli and tissues in the lung, whereas elastic work refers to the work of the intercostal muscles, chest wall, and
diaphragm. Increasing the respiration rate increases the flow-resistive work of the airways and decreases the elastic work of
the muscles. Decreasing the respiratory rate reverses the type of work required.
