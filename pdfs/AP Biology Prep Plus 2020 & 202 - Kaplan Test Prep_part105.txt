bin gene. If only
one faulty gene is inherited, the oﬀspring is oȇen asymptomatic
or may display a very mild sickling of cells.
Researchers who observe that the incidence of sickle cell anemia
is significantly higher in Americans whose grandparents or great-
grandparents immigrated from the Middle East, India, or Africa,
begin to investigate possible reasons for this occurrence. They
come across the map below, displaying the risk of malaria
worldwide, and find that it matches the increased frequency of
the sickled hemoglobin gene observed in diﬀerent American
populations.
Which of the following conclusions is best supported by this data?
There is no correlation between the increased frequency of
the sickled hemoglobin gene in locations known for a high
risk of malaria.
(A)
Individuals who are carriers of the sickled hemoglobin gene
have an advantage over individuals without it in countries
known for a high risk of malaria.
(B)
Individuals who are carriers of the sickled hemoglobin gene
