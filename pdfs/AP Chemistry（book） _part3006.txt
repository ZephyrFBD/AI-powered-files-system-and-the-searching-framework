sorbed (or released) by the system plus the work done on (or by) the system. 
 (Section 5.2) If we return a system to its original condition, no net change in energy 
takes place, but there is a change in the nature of the energy. Returning the system to its 
initial condition requires us to do work on the system. Doing work requires a focused, 
relatively concentrated application of energy. During the process, that focused, con-
centrated energy gets converted to a more diffuse form. Thus, the net change in the sur-
roundings involves the nature of the energyâ€”it becomes more dispersed and disordered 
and therefore less able to do work.
What we observe about energy changes is that energy has a tendency to spread out. Con-
sider a hot cup of tea. As it cools, energy spreads (or disperses) from the smaller volume of 
the tea into the greater volume of its surroundings. On a molecular level, the random, cha-
otic motion of particles (thermal motion) transfers energy through molecular coll
