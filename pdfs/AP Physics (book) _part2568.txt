n Fig. 23–37c, so that some of the rays diverging from each point
on the image can enter the eye. We can see a sharp image only for rays diverging
from each point on the image, because we see normal objects when diverging rays
from each point enter the eye as shown in Fig. 23–1. A normal eye cannot focus
converging rays; if your eye was positioned between points F and I in Fig. 23–37c,
it would not see a clear image. (More about our eyes in Section 25–2.) Figure 23–38
shows an image seen (a) on a white surface and (b) directly by the eye (and a camera)
placed behind the image. The eye can see both real and virtual images (see next
page) as long as the eye is positioned so rays diverging from the image enter it.

lens can form a real image (here of a
distant building, upside down) on a
white wall. (b) That same real image
is also directly visible to the eye.
