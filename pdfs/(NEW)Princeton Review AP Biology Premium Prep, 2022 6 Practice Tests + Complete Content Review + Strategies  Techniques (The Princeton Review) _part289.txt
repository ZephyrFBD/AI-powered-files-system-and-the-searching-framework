One of the major ways the testing board likes to test genetics is by having you do crosses. Crosses involve mating
hypothetical organisms with specific phenotypes and genotypes. We’ll look at some examples in a moment, but for
now, keep these test-taking tips in mind:
Label each generation in the cross. The first generation in an experiment is always called the parent, or P
generation. The offspring of the P generation are called the first filial, or F1 generation. Members of the next
generation, the grandchildren, are called the F2 generation.
Always write down the symbols you’re using for alleles, along with a key to remind yourself what the symbols
refer to. Use uppercase for dominant alleles and lowercase for recessive alleles.
Now let’s look at some basic genetic principles.
MENDELIAN GENETICS
One of Mendel’s hobbies was to study the effects of cross-br
