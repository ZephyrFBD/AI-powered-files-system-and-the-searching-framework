adiation from the Sun consists of visible
light plus many other wavelengths that the eye is not sensitive to, including
infrared (IR) radiation, which is mainly responsible for heating the Earth.
The rate at which an object radiates energy has been found to be proportional
to the fourth power of the Kelvin temperature, T. That is, an object at 2000 K,
as compared to one at 1000 K, radiates energy at a rate 
times as much.
The rate of radiation is also proportional to the area A of the emitting object,
so the rate at which energy leaves the object,
is

This is called the Stefan-Boltzmann equation, and 
is a universal constant called
the Stefan-Boltzmann constant which has the value
The factor 
called the emissivity, is a numberâ€  between 0 and 1 that is character-
istic of the surface of the radiating material. Very black surfaces, such as charcoal,
have emissivity close to 1, whereas shiny metal surfaces have 
close to zero and
thus emit correspondingly less radiation. The value o
