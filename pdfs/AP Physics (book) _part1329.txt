together (say, electronically), interfere with one another and beats are produced.
The beat frequency is equal to the difference in the two frequencies, 103 Hz. This
Doppler technique is used in a variety of medical applications, usually with ultra-
sonic waves in the megahertz frequency range. For example, ultrasonic waves
reflected from red blood cells can be used to determine the velocity of blood flow.
Similarly, the technique can be used to detect the movement of the chest of a young
fetus and to monitor its heartbeat.
For convenience, we can write Eqs. 12–2 and 12–3 as a single equation that
covers all cases of both source and observer in motion:
(12;4)
To get the signs right, recall from your own experience that the frequency is
higher when observer and source approach each other, and lower when they move
apart. Thus the upper signs in numerator and denominator apply if source and/or
observer move toward each other; the lower signs apply if they are moving apart.
