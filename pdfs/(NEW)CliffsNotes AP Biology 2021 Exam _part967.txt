ity (or, at lower depths, fewer
plants are able to carry out photosynthesis because of reduced levels of light).
1 pt: At lower depths, less oxygen is available for animals to carry out respiration.
1 pt: Less food (plants and animals) is available to animals at lower depths because most plants live closer to the
surface.
Question 2 (10 points maximum)
a. description for growth in part I (2 points maximum)
1 pt: In the beginning, the population is experiencing exponential growth (or J-shape growth).
1 pt: In the beginning, resources are readily available.
1 pt: In the beginning, competition and predation (or disease) is minimal.
1 pt: When the population approaches its peak size, competition, predation, or disease increase and resources
become more limited. b. calculation of growth rate (2 points maximum)
1 pt: The population size at the end of the first and second years is 100 and 300 individuals, respectively.
1 pt: Rate of population increase
