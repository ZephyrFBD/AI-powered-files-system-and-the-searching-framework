d their captions carefully, and make
your own series of diagrams. Despite the difficulty of the information, many concepts will seem familiar, such as the role
of proteins embedded in plasma cell membranes and interactions among different types of cells and molecules.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 and Big Idea 3
of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP® exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
Big Idea 2
Biological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,
and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.
Enduring
