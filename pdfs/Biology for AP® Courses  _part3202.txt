ly adapting mechanoreceptors that sense deep transient (but not prolonged)
pressure and high-frequency vibration. Pacinian receptors detect pressure and vibration by being compressed, stimulating
their internal dendrites. There are fewer Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings in skin than there are Merkel’s disks and
Meissner’s corpuscles.

and high-frequency vibration. (credit: modification of work by Ed Uthman; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
In proprioception, proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals travel through myelinated afferent neurons running from the spinal
cord to the medulla. Neurons are not physically connected, but communicate via neurotransmitters secreted into synapses
or “gaps” between communicating neurons. Once in the medulla, the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus.
Muscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of
