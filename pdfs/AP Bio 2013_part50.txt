ure above depicts the DNA-protein complex that is assembled at the transcriptional start site of gene X 
when the expression of gene X is activated in liver cells. Previous studies have shown that gene X is never 
expressed in nerve cells. Based on the diagram, which of the following most likely contributes to the specific 
expression pattern of gene X ? 
(A) Expression of gene X produces large amounts of tRNA but undetectable amounts of mRNA. 
(B) The general transcription factors inhibit the activation of gene X in liver cells by blocking the activator from 
binding to RNA polymerase II. 
(C) The activator is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that is present in some tissues but not in other 
tissues. 
(D) The enhancer is a unique DNA segment that is added to the nuclear DNA of some cells of an organism 
during the process of mitotic cell division but not other cells.
