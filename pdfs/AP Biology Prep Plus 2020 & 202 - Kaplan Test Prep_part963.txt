t the same rate when grown together as they
did when grown separately.
50. C
All prokaryotes contain ribosomes, cytoplasm, and a circular
chromosome, all of which are enclosed in a single plasma membrane.
Although the eukaryotic versions of these structures diﬀer, eukaryotes
also contain ribosomes, cytoplasm, chromosomes, and a cell
membrane, which eliminates (A), (B), and (D). (C) is correct because
only eukaryotes contain membrane-bound organelles, such as the
endoplasmic reticulum.
51. D
The results show that only eukaryotic organisms appear to be aﬀected
by the drug, so the cellular target is most likely an organelle that
prokaryotes do not possess. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes contain
ribosomes, DNA, cytoplasm, and a cell membrane. Most prokaryotes
and some eukaryotes, such as plants, fungi, and protists, have evolved
to possess a cell wall as well. Thus, (D) is the least likely target because
it is shared by both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Mitochondria, the
Golgi apparatus, a
