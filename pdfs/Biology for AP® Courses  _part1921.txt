 and an activator domain (AD). The binding domain is able to bind the
promoter in the absence of the activator domain, but it does not turn on transcription. A protein called the bait is
attached to the BD, and a protein called the prey is attached to the AD. Transcription occurs only if the prey “catches”
the bait.
The challenge of techniques used for proteomic analyses is the difficulty in detecting small quantities of proteins. Although
mass spectrometry is good for detecting small amounts of proteins, variations in protein expression in diseased states can
be difficult to discern. Proteins are naturally unstable molecules, which makes proteomic analysis much more difficult than
genomic analysis.
Cancer Proteomics
Genomes and proteomes of patients suffering from specific diseases are being studied to understand the genetic basis of
the disease. The most prominent disease being studied with proteomic approaches is cancer. Proteomic approaches are
being used to improve screening and e
