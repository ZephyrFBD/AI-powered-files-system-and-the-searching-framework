alence point, find the pH on the 
curve at halfway to the equivalence point. The pH you read off 
the graph at that point corresponds to the pKa of the weak acid. 
If the acid’s concentration is too low, however, the autoionization 
of water becomes significant, and this graphical way of measuring 
pKa is not as accurate.
Titrating with an Acid–Base Indicator
Often in an acid–base titration, an indicator is used rather than 
a pH meter. An indicator is a compound that changes color 
in solution over a specific pH range. Optimally, an indicator 
should change color at the equivalence point in a titration. In 
practice, however, an indicator need not precisely mark the 
equivalence point. The pH changes very rapidly near the equiv-
alence point, and in this region one drop of titrant can change 
the pH by several units. Thus, an indicator beginning and 
ending its color change anywhere on the rapid-rise portion of 
the titration curve gives a sufficiently accurate measure of the 
titrant
