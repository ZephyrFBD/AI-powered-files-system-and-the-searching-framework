 problems of replicating telomeres because circular chromosomes don’t have
ends.
Transcription in prokaryotes is also similar to that of eukaryotes. However, prokaryotic genes do not have introns.
But a single mRNA transcript may contain multiple genes whose enzyme products function sequentially as part of a
metabolic pathway. Such gene clusters are called operons. Also, translation is coupled with transcription—that is,
the ribosome attaches to one end of the mRNA transcript and begins translation while the mRNA transcript is still
being produced at the other end.
Genetic variation is introduced into prokaryotes through horizontal gene transfer. Although it occurs among both
archaea and bacteria, it is best understood among bacteria. It occurs in the following ways:
1. Conjugation is a process of DNA exchange between bacteria. A donor bacterium produces a tube, or pilus
(plural, pili), that connects to a recipient bacterium. Through the pilus, the donor bacterium sends chromosomal or
