above titration curve shows the titration of 25 mL of Na2CO3 with 
HCl, both with 0.1 M concentrations. The overall reaction between 
the two is
Na2CO31aq2 + HCl1aq2 ¡  2 NaCl1aq2 + CO21g2 + H2O1l2
The initial (pH sodium carbonate in water only) is near 11 because 
CO3

oxidation state. The reaction with water produces the oxyacid with 
phosphorus in that oxidation state, H3PO3. Thus, the reaction is anal-
ogous to Equation 22.48, which also shows a trihalide reacting with 
water. page 971 CO21g2 page 976 Silicon is the element, Si. Silica 
is SiO2. Silicones are polymers that have an O¬ Si ¬ O backbone and
