etermines the predominant
vegetation. In turn, the vegetation influences what types of animals can inhabit the area. Comparing the annual totals of
precipitation and fluctuations in precipitation from one biome to another provides clues as to the importance of abiotic
factors in the distribution of biomes. The same type of biome can occur in different areas of the world (Figure 35.12).
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP速
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP速 exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
