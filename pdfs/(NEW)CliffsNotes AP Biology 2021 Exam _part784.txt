In this part of the investigation, you explore the effect of lectins on the roots of onions. The lectins are extracted
from kidney beans and are used to simulate the effect of fungal lectins. You are provided with two kinds of onion
roots—roots that have been treated with lectins and roots that have not been treated. You follow the following steps:
1. Prepare microscope slides of treated root tips (treatment group) and untreated root tips (control group).
2. Under the microscope, count the number of cells undergoing mitosis (all stages) and the number of cells not
actively dividing (cells in interphase) for both treated and untreated root tips.
3. Calculate the percentages of cells undergoing mitosis and cells in
 
interphase for both treated and untreated root tips. Use a chi-square (χ2)
statistical analysis to evaluate whether the difference between the treated root tips (the observed data) and the
untreated root tips (the expected data) is statistically significant.
