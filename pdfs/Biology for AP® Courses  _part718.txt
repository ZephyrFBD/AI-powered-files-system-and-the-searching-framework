hemical reactions might proceed best in a slightly acidic or non-polar
environment. The chemical properties that emerge from the particular arrangement of amino acid residues within an active
site create the perfect environment for an enzyme’s specific substrates to react.
You’ve learned that the activation energy required for many reactions includes the energy involved in manipulating or
slightly contorting chemical bonds so that they can easily break and allow others to reform. Enzymatic action can aid this
process. The enzyme-substrate complex can lower the activation energy by contorting substrate molecules in such a way
as to facilitate bond-breaking, helping to reach the transition state. Finally, enzymes can also lower activation energies by
taking part in the chemical reaction itself. The amino acid residues can provide certain ions or chemical groups that actually
form covalent bonds with substrate molecules as a necessary step of the reaction process. In these cases, it is im
