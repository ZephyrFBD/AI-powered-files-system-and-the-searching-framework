have to be written out. However, if the base numbers are different but the expo-
nents are the same, we can write a second rule:
(A;2)
For example,
since
The third rule involves a power raised to another power:
means 
which is equal to
The general rule is then
(A;3)
In this case, the exponents are multiplied.
Negative exponents are used for reciprocals. Thus,
and so on. The reason for using negative exponents is to allow us to use the
multiplication rules given above. For example,
means
after canceling 3 of the a’s. Rule A–1 gives us the same result:
What does an exponent of zero mean? That is, what is 
Any number
raised to the zeroth power is defined as being equal to 1:
This definition is used because it follows from the rules for adding exponents.
For example,
But does
actually equal 1? Yes, because
Fractional exponents are used to represent roots. For example,
means the 
square root of a; that is,
Similarly,
means the cube root of a, and so
on. The fourth root of a means that if yo
