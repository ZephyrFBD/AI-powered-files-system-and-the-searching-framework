. The disaccharides are broken
down into monosaccharides by enzymes called maltases, sucrases, and lactases, which are also present in the brush border
of the small intestinal wall. Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose. Other disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose are
broken down by sucrase and lactase, respectively. Sucrase breaks down sucrose (or “table sugar”) into glucose and fructose,
and lactase breaks down lactose (or “milk sugar”) into glucose and galactose. The monosaccharides (glucose) thus produced
are absorbed and then can be used in metabolic pathways to harness energy. The monosaccharides are transported across
the intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream to be transported to the different cells in the body. The steps in carbohydrate
digestion are summarized in Figure 25.17 and Table 25.5.
Figure 25.17 Digestion of carbohydrates is performed by several enzymes. Starch and glycogen are broken down into
glucose by amylase and maltase. Sucrose (table sugar) and lac
