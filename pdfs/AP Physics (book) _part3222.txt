ther, and the
probability distribution looks like Fig. 29–2: the electrons can spend much of
their time between the two nuclei. The two positively charged nuclei are attracted
to the negatively charged electron cloud between them, and this is the attraction
that holds the two hydrogen atoms together to form a hydrogen molecule. This 
is a covalent bond.
The probability distributions of Figs. 29–1 and 29–2 can perhaps be better
understood on the basis of waves. What the exclusion principle requires is that
when the spins are the same, there is destructive interference of the electron wave
functions in the region between the two atoms. But when the spins are opposite,
constructive interference occurs in the region between the two atoms, resulting in
a large amount of negative charge there. Thus a covalent bond can be said to be
the result of constructive interference of the electron wave functions in the space
between the two atoms, and of the electrostatic attraction of the two positive
