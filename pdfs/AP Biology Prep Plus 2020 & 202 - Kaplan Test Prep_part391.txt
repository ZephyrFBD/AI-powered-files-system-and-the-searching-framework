10.2 Explain the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis
metabolic needs. In this way, photosynthesis is the energy foundation of
most living systems.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Not all autotrophs use photosynthesis. Some, such as bacteria
that live near hydrothermal vents at the ocean floor, use
chemosynthesis, a process that extracts energy through the
oxidation of inorganic compounds.
PHOTOSYNTHESIS OVERVIEW
Whereas cellular respiration takes place in all living organisms, only
certain organisms contain the necessary pigments to perform
photosynthesis, a process of capturing the energy of light and storing it in
the chemical bonds of carbohydrates for later use. Plant cells have both
chloroplasts and mitochondria to perform photosynthesis and cellular
respiration, respectively. Photosynthesis is actually the reverse reaction
of cellular respiration.

Perhaps the most surprising aspect of photosynthesis is the ability of
