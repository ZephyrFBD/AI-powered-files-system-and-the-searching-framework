ratus. Other samples can be
loaded in additional wells, including a sample of DNA of known fragment sizes to be used as a comparison
standard.
4. Begin electrophoresis. The electrophoresis apparatus applies a voltage to opposite ends of the gel. DNA carries an
overall negative charge due to its phosphate groups, and, as a result, fragments migrate from the negative to the
positive electrode. Turn off the apparatus when the tracking dye nears the end of the gel.
5. Immerse the gel in methylene blue, a dye that allows the fragments to be observed.
 
6. Record the distance each fragment has migrated from the well. The
 
migration distance for a fragment is inversely proportional to the log10
of its molecular weightâ€”longer, heavier fragments move more slowly and travel shorter distances than smaller
fragments. The number of base pairs (bp length) in a fragment can be substituted for its molecular weight.
7. Using semi-log graph paper, prepare a standard curve using the observed migration d
