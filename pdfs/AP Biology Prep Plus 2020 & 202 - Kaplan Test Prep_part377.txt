 correspond with
a concentration of 88.9 μM if you were to continue extrapolating. (C) is
the Vmax given for the concentration of 66.7 μM in the table and there is
no evidence to suggest that the Vmax won’t continue to increase with
increasing concentration, so this answer is too low. (D) is even lower
and would correspond with a concentration around 60 μM.
1. C
Learning Objective: 9.4
Because the reaction rate is already close to its maximum at 6.0 mM,
the rate would not change much if the substrate concentration was
increased further. At most, the rate would increase slightly. (C) is thus
correct. (A) is incorrect because the reaction rate would not increase
significantly, but only slightly. (B) is incorrect because the reaction rate
would not decrease. (D) is incorrect because the change is predictable.
2. B
Learning Objective: 9.5
The reaction rate is predicted to increase due to the increase in
substrate concentration. This is true unless it is already at the
maximum for that pH (
