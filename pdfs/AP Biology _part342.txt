es, β-galactosidase, permease, and
transacetylase, are coded for by three genes in the lac operon (Z, Y, and
A); see Figures 9.12 and 9.13. In order for these three genes to be
transcribed, the repressor must be prevented from binding to the operator
and RNA polymerase must bind to the promoter region. Allolactose, an
isomer of lactose, is the inducer that facilitates this process by binding to
the active repressor and inactivating it. When a person drinks milk, they
ingest allolactose, the inducer, which deactivates the repressor, allowing
RNA polymerase to bind to DNA. When RNA polymerase binds to DNA,
transcription of the lac genes occurs and lactose can be utilized as an
energy source.

Both positive and negative control mechanisms regulate gene expression in bacteria
and viruses.
