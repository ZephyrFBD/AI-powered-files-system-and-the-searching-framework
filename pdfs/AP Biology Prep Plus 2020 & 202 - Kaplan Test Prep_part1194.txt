Population Growth
= B – D
Exponential Growth
Logistic Growth
dY = amount of
change
dt = change in time
B = birth rate
D = death rate
N = population size
K = carrying capacity
rmax = maximum per
capita growth rate of
population
Water Potential (Ψ)
Ψ = ΨP + ΨS
ΨP = pressure potential
ΨS = solute potential
The water potential will be equal to
the solute potential of a solution in
an open container because the
pressure potential of the solution in
an open container is zero.
The Solute Potential of the Solution
ΨS = − iCRT
Temperature Coeﬀicient
T2 = higher
i = ionization constant (this is 1.0 for
sucrose because sucrose does not
ionize in water.)
C = molar concentration
R = pressure constant (R = 0.0831 liter
bars/mole K)
T = temperature in Kelvin (°C + 273)
