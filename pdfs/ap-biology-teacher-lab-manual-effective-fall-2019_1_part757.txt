f dew.” The explanation for the species name melanogaster should be clear after 
observing the fly’s physical features. It has a black “stomach,” or abdomen. No doubt 
the dew-loving, black-bellied fly will continue to make contributions to the scientific 
community and to student projects.
We begin our investigation with a few simple questions. What do you know about 
fruit flies? Have you seen fruit flies outside the lab and, if so, where? Describe where and 
when you have noted fruit flies.
