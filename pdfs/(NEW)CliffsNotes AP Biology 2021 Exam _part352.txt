 operator region is occupied by the repressor, RNA polymerase is unable to
transcribe several structural genes that code for enzymes that control the uptake and subsequent breakdown of
lactose. When lactose is available, however, some of the lactose (in a converted form) combines with the repressor
to make it inactive. When the repressor is inactivated, RNA polymerase is able to transcribe the genes that code for
the enzymes that break down lactose. Since a substance (lactose, in this case) is required to induce (turn on) the
operon, the enzymes that the operon produces are said to be inducible enzymes, and the operon is an inducible
operon. Because a repressor protein is involved, it is an example of negative regulation.
3. Glucose repression is a second regulatory process that influences the lac operon. Glucose is a preferential source
of energy when both glucose and lactose are present. But when only lactose is present, this process enhances the
breakdown of lactose (already permitt
