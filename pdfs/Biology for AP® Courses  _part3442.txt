D. Compared to the naïve control where homeostasis is not
disrupted, qualitatively analyze these data for the
disruption of the endocrine system in offspring of a female
rat exposed to both physical and chemical stresses.
E. In female sheep, the estrus cycle is coordinated by the

Predict the effect on fitness of this control of gene

The “ram effect” is a livestock management practice

effect.
