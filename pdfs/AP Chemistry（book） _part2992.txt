 nature of energy, the first law of thermo-
dynamics, and the concept of enthalpy. In this chapter, we discuss the second law 
of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy, a thermodynamic quantity that we 
encountered briefly in Chapter 13.

19.1 âˆ£ Spontaneous Processes
If you release a brick from your hand, it will fall. It never jumps back into your hand 
no matter how long you wait. Likewise, if you let a nail sit in the rain, it will even-
tually rust. The rusted nail will never convert to its original condition even when 
the sun shines and time passes. These are but two examples illustrating that there 
is directionality to events. We say that events like the falling brick and rusting nail 
occur spontaneously. A spontaneous process is one that occurs on its own with-
out any outside assistance.
A spontaneous process occurs in one direction only, and the reverse of any 
spontaneous process is always nonspontaneous. Drop an egg above a hard surface, for 
example,
