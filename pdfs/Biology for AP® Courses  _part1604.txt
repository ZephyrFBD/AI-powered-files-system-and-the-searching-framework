nonpathogenic bacteria
2.
plasmids were transferred to nonpathogenic
bacteria from pathogenic bacteria through
conjugation
3.
nonpathogenic bacteria acquired pathogenicity
when incubated in a broth containing heat-
treated, pathogenic bacteria
4.
polysaccharide cell capsules from pathogenic
bacteria were transferred to nonpathogenic
bacteria
B. Griffithâ€™s experiment, however, left undetermined the
identity of the cellular component that encoded genetic
information. The identity of DNA as the carrier of genetic
information was resolved through the experiments by
Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey because they observed
the following:
1.
injections with a serum containing chemically
isolated polysaccharides and nonpathogenic
bacteria were not lethal
2.
pathogenic bacterial DNA that was radioactively
labeled using a phosphorus isotope was not
present in mice that died
3.
bacteriophages from a bacterial culture grown in
a nutrient-containing medium and rad
