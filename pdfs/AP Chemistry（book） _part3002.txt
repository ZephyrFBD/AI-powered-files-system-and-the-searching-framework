f the 
surroundings are at temperature T and the system is at an infinitesimally higher tem-
perature T + dT, then an infinitesimal amount of heat flows from the system to sur-
roundings. We can reverse the direction of heat flow by making an infinitesimal change 
of temperature in the opposite direction, lowering the system temperature to T - dT. 
Now the direction of heat flow is from surroundings to system. Thus, for the process to 
be reversible, the amounts of heat must be infinitesimally small and the transfer of heat 
must occur infinitely slowly.
Reversible processes are those that reverse direction whenever an infinitesimal  
change is made in some property of the system.
Now letâ€™s consider another example, the expansion of an ideal gas at constant tem-
perature (referred to as an isothermal process). In the cylinder-piston arrangement of 
Figure 19.4, when the partition is removed, the gas expands spontaneously to fill the 
evacuated space. Can we determine whether this parti
