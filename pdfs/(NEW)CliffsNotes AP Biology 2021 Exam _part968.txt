 (4 points maximum)
1 pt: The population is fluctuating (or fluctuating about a carrying capacity that would be predicted from a logistic
model for population growth).
1 pt: Resources, living conditions, or competition may be varying from season to season.
1 pt: The life-history strategy for this population most closely resembles a K-selection strategy.
1 pt: In the K-selection strategy, individuals have multiple births over a long lifetime, producing few offspring per
pregnancy, with offspring requiring considerable parental care (all relative to species with r-selection).
1 pt: Possible examples include snowshoe hares, lynx, elephants, and humans.
d. description for growth in part III (4 points maximum)
1 pt: The population is experiencing a crash (or a catastrophic event).
1 pt: Resources may have been depleted, disease may have overwhelmed the population, or environmental
conditions may have deteriorated or otherwise changed.
1 pt: Under certain conditions (see above), any populati
