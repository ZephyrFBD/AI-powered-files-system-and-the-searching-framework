inues with its original pattern away
from the region of overlap.
(e) Waves cannot run into each other; they always come
from the same direction and so are parallel.
14. A student attaches one end of a Slinky to the top of a table.
She holds the other end in her hand, stretches it to a length ,
and then moves it back and forth to send a wave down the
Slinky. If she next moves her hand faster while keeping the
length of the Slinky the same, how does the wavelength
down the Slinky change?
(a) It increases.
(b) It stays the same.
(c) It decreases.
15. A wave transports
(a) energy but not matter.
(b) matter but not energy.
(c) both energy and matter.

1. (I) If a particle undergoes SHM with amplitude 0.21 m,
what is the total distance it travels in one period?
2. (I) The springs of a 1700-kg car compress 5.0 mm when its
66-kg driver gets into the driver’s seat. If the car goes over
a bump, what will be the frequency of oscillations? Ignore
damping.
