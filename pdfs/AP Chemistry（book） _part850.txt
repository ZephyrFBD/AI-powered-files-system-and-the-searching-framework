 The complete combustion of 1 mol of C4H10O1l2 to CO21g2 
and H2O1l2 yields ∆H° = -2723.7 kJ. (a) Write a balanced 
equation for the combustion of 1 mol of C4H10O1l2. (b) By 
using the information in this problem and data in Table 5.3, 
calculate ∆Hf° for diethyl ether.
 5.79 Ethanol 1C2H5OH2 is blended with gasoline as an automo-
bile fuel. (a) Write a balanced equation for the combustion 
of liquid ethanol in air. (b) Calculate the standard enthalpy 
change for the reaction, assuming H2O1g2 as a product. 
 
(c) Calculate the heat produced per liter of ethanol by com-
bustion of ethanol under constant pressure. Ethanol has a 
density of 0.789 g>mL. (d) Calculate the mass of CO2 pro-
duced per kJ of heat emit
