To examine this problem, we apply the Rayleigh criterion: two objects (or two
nearby points on one object) are just resolvable if they are separated by an angle 
(Fig. 25–31) given by Eq. 25–7:
This formula is valid for either a microscope or a telescope, where D is the diam-
eter of the objective lens or mirror. For a telescope, the resolution is specified 
by stating as given by this equation.†
