pportunities for students to design and conduct experiments 
to more deeply investigate questions that emerge from their observations and results. 
Students revisit the concepts of osmosis and water potential when they investigate 
transpiration in plants (big idea 4). 
 
In  Investigation 5: Photosynthesis,  students learn how to measure 
the rate of photosynthesis indirectly by using the floating leaf disk procedure to gauge 
oxygen production. Photosynthesis is a strategy employed by autotrophs to capture light 
energy to build energy-rich carbohydrates. The process is summarized by the following 
reaction:
2H2O  +  CO2  +  light â†’ carbohydrate (CH2O)  +  O2  +  H2O
To determine the rate of photosynthesis, one could measure the production of O2 or the 
consumption of CO2. The difficulty related to measuring the production of oxygen gas is 
compounded by the complementary process of aerobic respiration consuming oxygen as 
it is produced. Therefore, the rate of photosynthesis general
