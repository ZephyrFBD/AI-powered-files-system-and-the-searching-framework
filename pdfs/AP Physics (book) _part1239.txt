0-g mass is
added to m, the frequency is 0.60 Hz. What is the value
of m?
8. (II) A vertical spring with spring stiffness constant 
oscillates with an amplitude of 28.0 cm when 0.235 kg
hangs from it. The mass passes through the equilibrium
point
with positive velocity at

equation describes this motion as a function of time?
(b) At what times will the spring be longest and shortest?

9. Consider a wave traveling down a cord and the transverse
motion of a small piece of the cord. Which of the following
is true?
(a) The speed of the wave must be the same as the speed
of a small piece of the cord.
(b) The frequency of the wave must be the same as the
frequency of a small piece
