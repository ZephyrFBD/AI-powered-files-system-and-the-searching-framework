Electron in TV tube. Suppose an electron is accelerated
from rest through a potential difference
(Fig. 17–4).
(a) What is the change in electric potential energy of the electron? What is 
(b) the kinetic energy, and (c) the speed of the electron 
as a result of this acceleration?
APPROACH The electron, accelerated toward the positive plate, will change in
potential energy by an amount
