 of the p allele, which is the
dominant allele, is 0.4 because p + q = 1. (EVO-1 & SP 5)
(A) According to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, p is the dominant
allele and q is the recessive allele. (EVO-1)
(C) The black peppered moths replaced the white peppered moths.
Since one characteristic replaced another, this is directional
selection. (EVO-1)
(A) Stabilizing selection tends to eliminate the extremes in a
population. (EVO-1)
(B) Disruptive selection tends to select for the extremes. Originally,
there was probably a range of coloration of snakes in the area in
question. Over time, pressure from the environment selected against
different colorations until only two remained. (EVO-1)
(D) Sexual selection has to do with the selection for traits that attract
a mate. (EVO-1)
(C) The purpose of this now-famous experiment was to demonstrate
that life on Earth could have begun from simple inorganic
molecules. (SYI-3)
(C) Choice A is not correct because the stem of the question says
nothing about b
