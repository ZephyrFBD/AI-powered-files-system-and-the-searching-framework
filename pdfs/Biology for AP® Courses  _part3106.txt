tonomic nervous system serves as the relay between the CNS and the internal organs. It controls the lungs, the heart,
smooth muscle, and exocrine and endocrine glands. The autonomic nervous system controls these organs largely without
conscious control; it can continuously monitor the conditions of these different systems and implement changes as needed.
Signaling to the target tissue usually involves two synapses: a preganglionic neuron (originating in the CNS) synapses to a
neuron in a ganglion that, in turn, synapses on the target organ, as illustrated in Figure 26.26. There are two divisions of
the autonomic nervous system that often have opposing effects: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic
nervous system.
Sympathetic Nervous System
The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the “fight or flight” response that occurs when an animal encounters
a dangerous situation. One way to remember this is to think of the surprise a person feels when encountering a sna
