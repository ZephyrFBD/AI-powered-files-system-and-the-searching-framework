35 light-years?
6. (II) At what speed v will the length of a 1.00-m stick look
10.0% shorter (90.0 cm)?
7. (II) At what speed do the relativistic formulas for (a) length
and (b) time intervals differ from classical values by 1.00%?
(This is a reasonable way to estimate when to use relativistic
calculations rather than classical.)
8. (II) You decide to travel to a star 62 light-years from Earth
at a speed that tells you the distance is only 25 light-
years. How many years would it take you to make the trip?
2.60 * 10–8 s.
4.40 * 10–8 s?
2.90 * 108 ms.
4.76 * 10–6 s.
2.70 * 108 ms.
9. (II) A friend speeds by you in her spacecraft at a speed of
0.720c. It is measured in your frame to be 4.80 m long and
1.35 m high. (a) What will be its length and height at rest?
(b) How many seconds elapsed on your friend’s watch when
20.0 s passed on yours? (c) How fast did you appear to be
traveling according to your friend? (d) How many seconds
elapsed on your watch when she saw 20.0 s pass on hers?
