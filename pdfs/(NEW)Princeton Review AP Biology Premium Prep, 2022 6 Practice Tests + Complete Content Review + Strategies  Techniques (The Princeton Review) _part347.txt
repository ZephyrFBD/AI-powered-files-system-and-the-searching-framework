usually a bit more complicated than that because there is a group of molecules called transcription factors that can
either encourage or inhibit this from happening. This is often accomplished by making it easier or more difficult for
RNA polymerase to bind or to move to the start site.
Sometimes changes to the packaging of DNA will alter the ability of the transcription machinery to access a gene.
These types of changes are called epigenetic changes, and they usually occur through a modification to a histone
protein that is involved in winding up the DNA. A tighter wrap around a histone makes the DNA more difficult to
access and a looser wrap makes it easier to access.
The following examples are famous models of regulation. You do not need to memorize them, but you should be
familiar with the big picture of how things can come together to regulate transcription. Most of what we know about
gene regulation comes from our studies of E. coli. In bacteria, a cluster of genes can be under
