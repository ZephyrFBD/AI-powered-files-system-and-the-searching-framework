flow of electrons through the cyclic pathway. 
• 
There is less/no NADP+ to accept the electrons, so the electrons pass (instead) to the 
cyclic pathway/from ferredoxin to the cytochrome complex. 
1 point 
(c) 
Using rice plants, scientists examined the effect of a mutation that results in the loss of 
the protein CRR6. CRR6 is a part of the photosystem I complex, and its absence reduces 
the activity of photosystem I. Predict the effect of the mutation on the rate of biomass 
(dry weight) accumulation. 
• 
The rate (of biomass accumulation)/Biomass/It will be lower (in comparison with 
plants without the mutation). 
1 point 
(d) 
 Justify your prediction in part (c). 
• 
There will be insufficient ATP/NADPH produced for the synthesis of 
carbohydrates/the Calvin cycle.
