will form one particle in solution. For ionic compounds, which do
separate into ions in solution (for example, sodium chloride NaCl or calcium chloride CaCl2), the ionization constant
depends upon how many ions the compound will form in solution. NaCl forms two ions when in solution, Na+ and
Cl–, so the ionization constant for NaCl is 2. CaCl2 forms three ions when in solution, Ca2+ and two Cl– ions, so the
ionization constant for CaCl2 is 3.
C refers to the concentration of solute in the solution. Since there is a negative sign in the solute potential
formula, as the concentration of solute increases, the solute potential decreases. Solutions with more solute (higher
solute concentrations) will have lower water potentials if all other conditions are equal.
R is the pressure constant, 
. You do not need to memorize this constant; it will be on the AP
Biology Equations and Formulas sheet that you will have access to during the exam.
T is the temperature of the solution. The temperature
