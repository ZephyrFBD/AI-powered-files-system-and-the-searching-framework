metal oxides are ionic compounds. The ionic oxides that dissolve in water form 
hydroxides and, consequently, are called either basic anhydrides or basic oxides. 
Barium oxide, for example, reacts with water to form barium hydroxide (Figure 22.12). 
These kinds of reactions are due to the high basicity of the O2 -  ion and its virtually com-
plete hydrolysis in water:
 
O2 -1aq2 + H2O1l2 ¡ 2 OH -1aq2 
[22.24]
Even those ionic oxides that are insoluble in water tend to dissolve in strong acids. Iron(III) 
oxide, for example, dissolves in acids:
 
Fe2O31s2 + 6 H+1aq2 ¡ 2 Fe3 +1aq2 + 3 H2O1l2 
[22.25]
