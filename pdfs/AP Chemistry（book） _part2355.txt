ature, 
calculate the rate constant for the reaction at 50 °C.
 
[14.119] You obtain kinetic data for a reaction at a set of different 
temperatures. You plot ln k versus 1>T and obtain the fol-
lowing graph:
what familiar compound of hydrogen and oxygen does it 
appear similar?
 
[14.122]  The rates of many atmospheric reactions are accelerated 
by the absorption of light by one of the reactants. For ex-
ample, consider the reaction between methane and chlo-
rine to produce methyl chloride and hydrogen chloride:
Reaction 1: CH41g2 + Cl21g2 ¡  CH3Cl1g2 + HCl1g2
 
 This reaction is very slow in the absence of light. However, 
Cl21g2 can absorb light to form Cl atoms:
Reaction 2: Cl21g2 + hv ¡  2 Cl1g2
 
 Once the Cl atoms are generated, they can catalyze the 
reaction of CH4 and Cl2, according to the following pro-
posed mechanism:
Reaction 3: CH41g2 + Cl1g2 ¡  CH31g2 + HCl1g2
Reaction 4: CH31g2 + Cl21g2 ¡  CH3Cl1g2 + Cl1g2
 
 The enthalpy changes and activation energies for these
