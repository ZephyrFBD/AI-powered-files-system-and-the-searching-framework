Introduction
Each personâ€™s DNA is unique, and it is possible to detect differences among individuals within a species on the basis of these
unique features. DNA analysis has many practical applications, including identifying criminals (forensics), determining
paternity, tracing genealogy, identifying pathogens, researching archeological finds, tracing disease outbreaks, and studying
