diation was
trapped in the early plasma (yellow band). The time it takes light to reach us
from an event is called its lookback time. The “close-up” insert in Fig. 33–27
shows a photon scattering repeatedly inside that early plasma and then exiting
the plasma in a straight line. No matter what direction we look, our view of the
very early universe is blocked by this wall of plasma. It is like trying to look into
a very thick fog or into the surface of the Sun—we can see only as far as its
surface, called the surface of last scattering, but not into it. Wavelengths from
there are redshifted by 
Time 
in Fig. 33–27 is the lookback time
(not real time that goes forward).
Recall that when we view an object far away, we are seeing it as it was then,
when the light was emitted, not as it would appear today.
