expected increase in atomic size going from period 5 to period 6 transi-

paramagnetic material cause it to be weakly attracted into a magnetic 
field. 23.19 The diagram shows a material with misaligned spins that 
become aligned in the direction of an applied magnetic ﬁeld. This 
is a paramagnetic material. 23.21 (a) Primary valence is roughly the 
same as oxidation number. Oxidation number is a broader term than 
ionic charge, but Werner’s complexes contain metal ions where cat-
ion charge and oxidation number are equal. (b) Coordination num-
ber is the modern term for secondary valence. (c) NH3 can serve as a 
ligand because it has an unshared electron pair, while BH3 does
