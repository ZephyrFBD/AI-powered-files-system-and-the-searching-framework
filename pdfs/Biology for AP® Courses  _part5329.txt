avoid victimisation, scapegoating and misdirected criticism, but they
knew that their ‘recommendations’ would lead to exactly that and
the media were speciﬁcally used to stir-up the divide-and-conquer

conforming to fascism and impositions that the awake know are

twitchers and morons reporting neighbours and others to the face-
nappied police for breaking ‘Covid rules’ with fascist police

enslaving themselves and their kids. The words of a pastor in Nazi
