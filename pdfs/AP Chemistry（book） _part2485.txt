Le Châtelier’s Principle (section 15.7)
 15.61 Consider the following equilibrium for which ∆H 6 0
2 SO21g2 + O21g2 ∆ 2 SO31g2
 
 How will each of the following changes affect an equi-
librium mixture of the three gases: (a) O21g2 is added to 
the system; (b) the reaction mixture is heated; (c) the 
volume of the reaction vessel is doubled; (d) a catalyst is 
added to the mixture; (e) the total pressure of the system 
is increased by adding a noble gas; (f) SO31g2 is removed 
from the system?
 15.62 Consider the reaction
4 NH31g2 + 5 O21g2 ∆
 
4 NO1g2 + 6 H2O1g2, ∆H = -904.4 kJ
 
 Does each of the following increase, decrease, or leave 
unchanged the yield of NO at equilibrium? (a) increase 
3NH34; (b) increase 3H2O4; (c) decrease 3O24; (d) decrease 
the volume of the container in which the reaction occurs; 
(e) add a catalyst; (f) inc
