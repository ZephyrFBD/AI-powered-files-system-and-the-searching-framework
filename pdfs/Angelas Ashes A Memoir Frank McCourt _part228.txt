ter than Christmas because Dad takes us to the 
 
 Redemptorist church where all the priests wear white and sing.They’re 
 
 happy because Our Lord is in heaven. I ask Dad if the baby in the crib 
 
 is dead and he says, No, He was thirty-three when He died and there 
 
 He is, hanging on the cross. I don’t understand how He grew up so fast 
 
 that He’s hanging there with a hat made of thorns and blood every- 
 
 107 
 
 where, dripping from His head, His hands, His feet, and a big hole near 
 
  
  
 His belly. 
 
 Dad says I’ll understand when I grow up. He tells me that all the 
 
 time now and I want to be big like him so that I can understand everything. 
 
 It must be lovely to wake up in the morning and understand 
 
 everything. I wish I could be like all the big people in the church, standing 
 
 and kneeling and praying and understanding everything. 
 
 At the Mass people go up to the altar and the priest puts something 
 
 into their mouths.They come back to their seats wit
