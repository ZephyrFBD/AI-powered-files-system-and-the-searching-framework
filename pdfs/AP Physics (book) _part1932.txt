arge and 5.2 MJ of
energy to the Earth. (a) Across what potential difference did
it travel? (b) How much water could this boil and vaporize,
starting from room temperature? (See also Chapter 14.)
69. In an older television tube, electrons are accelerated by
thousands of volts through a vacuum. If a television set were
laid on its back, would electrons be able to move upward
against the force of gravity? What potential difference,
acting over a distance of 2.4 cm, would be needed to balance
the downward force of gravity so that an electron would
remain stationary? Assume that the electric field is uniform.
70. How does the energy stored in a capacitor change, as the
capacitor remains connected to a battery, if the separation
of the plates is doubled?
71. How does the energy stored in an isolated capacitor change
if (a) the potential difference is doubled, or (b) the separa-
tion of the plates is doubled?
72. A huge 4.0-F capacitor has enough stored energy to heat
2.8 kg of water from 21
