c substances, we 
need a different model to describe the bonding between atoms. G. N. Lewis reasoned 
that atoms might acquire a noble-gas electron configuration by sharing electrons 
with other atoms. A chemical bond formed by sharing a pair of electrons is a covalent 
bond.
The hydrogen molecule, H2, provides the simplest example of a covalent bond. 
When two hydrogen atoms are close to each other, the two positively charged 
nuclei repel each other, the two negatively charged electrons repel each other, and 
the nuclei and electrons attract each other, as shown in Figure 8.7(a). Because the 
molecule is stable, we know that the attractive forces must overcome the repul-
sive ones. Let’s take a closer look at the attractive forces that hold this molecule 
together.
