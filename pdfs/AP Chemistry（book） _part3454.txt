hlorine-32, (c) tin-108, (d) polonium-216. For any that 
do not, describe a nuclear decay process that would alter the 
 
neutron-to-proton ratio in the direction of increased stabil-
ity. [Section 21.2]
 
21.2  Write the balanced nuclear equation for the reaction repre-
sented by the diagram shown here. [Section 21.2]
 
21.7  All the stable isotopes of boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, 
and fluorine are shown in the accompanying chart (in 
red), along with their radioactive isotopes with t1>2 7 1 
min (in blue). (a) Write the chemical symbols, including 
mass and atomic numbers, for all of the stable isotopes. (b)
