o-3-methyldecanoic acid.
 24.48  Aldehydes and ketones can be named in a systematic way by 
counting the number of carbon atoms (including the car-
bonyl carbon) that they contain. The name of the aldehyde or 
ketone is based on the hydrocarbon with the same number of 
carbon atoms. The ending -al for aldehyde or -one for ketone 
is added as appropriate. Draw the structural formulas for the 
following aldehydes or ketones: (a) propanal, (b) 2-penta-
none, (c) 3-methyl-2-butanone, (d) 2-methylbutanal.
 24.49  Draw the condensed structure of the compounds formed 
by condensation reactions between (a) benzoic acid and 
ethanol, (b) ethanoic acid and methylamine, (c) acetic acid 
and phenol. Name the compound in each case.
 24.50  Draw the condensed structures of the compounds formed 
from (a) butanoic acid and methanol, (b) benzoic acid and 
2-propanol, (c) propanoic acid and dimethylamine. Name 
the compound in each case.
 24.51  Write a balanced chemical equation using condensed 
struct
