 H+1aq2 
[18.18]
Bromate ion, BrO3
-, has been shown to cause cancer in animal tests.
At present, there seem to be no completely satisfactory alternatives to chlorina-
tion or ozonation, and we are faced with a consideration of benefit versus risk. In this 
case, the risks of cancer from THMs and related substances in municipal water are 
very low relative to the risks of cholera, typhus, and gastrointestinal disorders from 
untreated water. When the water supply is cleaner to begin with, less disinfectant is 
needed and thus the risk of THMs is lowered. Once THMs form, their concentrations 
in the water supply can be reduced by aeration because the THMs are more volatile 
than water. Alternatively, they can be removed by adsorption onto activated charcoal 
or other adsorbents.
