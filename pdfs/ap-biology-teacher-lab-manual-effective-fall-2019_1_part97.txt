urrent AP Biology laboratory 
investigations is bioinformatics. In Investigation 3: Comparing DNA Sequences to 
Understand Evolutionary Relationships with BLAST, students will use the Basic Local 
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) to collect information to construct cladograms. 
Cladograms and phylogenetic trees are both visualizations of the evolutionary 
relatedness of species. A phylogentic tree will also show time and scale. 
If we use BLAST to compare several genes and use the information to construct 
cladograms, which parameters are likely to produce a relevant result? If we construct a 
multiple sequence alignment, how much do we affect our result by our choice of what 
counts as a chemically similar side chain of an amino acid in a protein? What if we 
assign different penalties for opening or closing a gap, or use different length chains for 
the size of gaps? Do the databases change sufficiently in a given time, so that we get a 
very different result from day to day? What if we
