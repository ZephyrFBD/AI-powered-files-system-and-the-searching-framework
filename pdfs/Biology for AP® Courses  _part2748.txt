Plants have many light responses, including
photosynthesis, photoperiodism, and phototropism
(growing toward a light source). Specific wavelengths of
light absorbed by different photoreceptors trigger
responses. This table shows some of the most common
photoreceptors and pigments and the major regions of the
spectrum in which they are active. Research shows that
plants bend toward blue light. Even mutant plants that lack
carotenoids will bend toward blue light. The photoreceptor
is likely _____.
a.
phytochrome
b.
chlorophyll
c.
phototro
