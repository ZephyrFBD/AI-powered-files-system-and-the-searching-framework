1. (I) Estimate the binding energy of a KCl molecule by
calculating the electrostatic potential energy when the 
and 
ions are at their stable separation of 0.28 nm.
Assume each has a charge of magnitude 1.0e.
2. (II) The measured binding energy of KCl is 4.43 eV. From
the result of Problem 1, estimate the contribution to the
binding energy of the repelling electron clouds at the
equilibrium distance 
3. (II) The equilibrium distance 
between two atoms in a
molecule is called the bond length. Using the bond lengths
of ho
