 how does it differ from potential energy? 
•  What environmental factors affect kinetic energy and diffusion? 
•  Why do these factors alter diffusion rates? How do they affect rates? 
•  How are gradients important in diffusion and osmosis? 
•  What is the explanation for the fact that most cells are small and have cell membranes 
with many convolutions? 
•  Will water move into or out of a plant cell if the cell has a higher water potential than 
the surrounding environment? 
•  What would happen if you applied saltwater to a plant? 
•  How does a plant cell control its internal (turgor) pressure?

■ Procedure 1: Surface Area and Cell Size 
Because cell size and shape are important factors in determining the rate of diffusion, 
students begin their investigation of the movement of molecules across cell membranes by 
exploring the relationship between surface area and volume. Ask students to consider cell
