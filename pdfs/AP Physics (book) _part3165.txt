time around another atom, forming a molecule. This is why the alkali metals are
very chemically reactive and have a valence of 
The other columns of the
Periodic Table can be treated similarly.
The presence of the transition elements in the center of the Periodic Table, as
well as the lanthanides (rare earths) and actinides below, is a result of incomplete
inner shells. For the lowest Z elements, the subshells are filled in a simple order:
first 1s, then 2s, followed by 2p, 3s, and 3p. You might expect that 3d
would be filled next, but it isn’t. Instead, the 4s level actually has a slightly lower
energy than the 3d (due to electrons interacting with each other), so it fills first
(K and Ca). Only then does the 3d shell start to fill up, beginning with Sc, as can
be seen in Table 28–4. (The 4s and 3d levels are close, so some elements have
only one 4s electron, such as Cr.) Most of the chemical properties of these transi-
tion elements are governed by the relatively loosely held 4s e
