se, the energy of the bonded molecule, at a separation 
is greater than
when there is no bond 
That is, an energy input is required to make the
bond (hence the binding energy is negative), and there is energy release when
the bond is broken. Such a bond is stable only because there is the barrier of the
activation energy. This type of bond is important in living cells, for it is in such
bonds that energy can be stored efficiently in certain molecules, particularly ATP
(adenosine triphosphate). The bond that connects the last phosphate group
(designated 
in Fig. 29–10) to the rest of the molecule (ADP, meaning adeno-
sine diphosphate, since it contains only two phosphates) has potential energy of
the shape shown in Fig. 29–10. Energy is stored in this bond. When the bond is
broken 
energy is released and this energy can be used to
make other chemical reactions “go.”
