rtiary consumers than they are for primary consumers.
Toxins are a concern higher up the food web because they can often become concentrated. For example, it is bad for
a toxin to be absorbed by a plant, but then a fish eats 10 toxin-affected plants and a bigger fish eats 10 of the little
fish, which is like 100 toxin-affected plants. Higher up the food web toxins can concentrate and the animals can begin
to be harmed by the level of toxin even though the primary consumers were not.
Question 6
a. Identify the null hypothesis of this experiment
Squirrels do not prefer one side of the road over another.
b. Complete the table with the average data and values necessary to test the hypothesis. (All white empty blanks
should be filled.)
c. Use statistics to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected.
Since our degree of freedom is 1 and we are using p = 0.05, our critical value is 3.841. Our Ï‡2 value is less than our
critical value, so we fail to reject our null hypothesis.
d.
