ghter cells, each of which
receives a nucleus containing the haploid number of chromosomes.
Between cell divisions, there may be a short rest period, or interkinesis,
during which the chromosomes partially uncoil.
MEIOSIS II
This second division is very similar to mitosis, except that meiosis II is not
preceded by chromosomal replication.
Prophase II
The centrioles migrate to opposite poles, and the spindle apparatus
forms.
Metaphase II
The chromosomes line up along the equatorial plane. The centromeres
divide, separating the chromosomes into two sister chromatids.
Anaphase II
The sister chromatids are pulled to opposite poles by the spindle fibers.
Telophase II
A nuclear membrane forms around each new (haploid) nucleus.
Cytokinesis follows and two daughter cells are formed. Thus, by the
completion of meiosis II, four haploid daughter cells are produced per
gametocyte. (In human females, only one of these becomes a functional
gamete.)
