f methane and oxygen below the
surface of a rice paddy are shown in the graph below (Lee
et al., Front. Microbiol, 25, 2015). Also shown are
estimates of the relative abundance of all genera of
methanotrophs (red line) and methanogens (blue line) as a
function of depth. Rice paddies are the largest contributor
to agricultural methane production. The estimates were
based on extraction and analysis of ribosomal RNA from
the soil.

D. Justify the selection of these measurements of the
concentrations of two types of microbes and the gases that
are consumed or produced to the development of a
quantitative understanding of the habitat range of both
groups and the control of methane release from rice fields.

100 trillion bacteria. Some sources claim that the surface
area of the cells lining the small and large intestines is
between 150 and 300 square meters and compare this ar
