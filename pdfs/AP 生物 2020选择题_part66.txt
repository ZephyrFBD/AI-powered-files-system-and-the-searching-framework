3. Pigeon lice (Columbicola columbae) are small parasites that feed on the feathers of the rock pigeon (Columba 
livia). The lice are host-specific, and transmission of lice between pigeons requires direct contact. Pigeons 
remove the lice with their beaks as they clean their feathers. Figure 1 shows the black and white phenotypes for 
pigeon feather color and the dark and light phenotypes for louse body color.

Researchers designed an experiment to test the hypothesis that the evolution of coloration in lice is driven by 
birds. Researchers transferred 25 lice from a random sample of lice obtained from wildâ€‘caught rock pigeons to 
each individual in groups of black pigeons and white pigeons. Half of the pigeons from
