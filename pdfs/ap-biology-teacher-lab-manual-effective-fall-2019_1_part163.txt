netic variations), they design and conduct a selection experiment based on 
observable traits in Wisconsin Fast Plants growing in the classroom. These quantitative 
traits include number of trichomes (plant hairs) and plant height. Students may benefit 
from having an understanding of evolution and natural selection prior to beginning this 
investigation.
 Investigation 2: Mathematical Modeling: Hardy-Weinberg  is 
a revision of Laboratory 8 (Population Genetics and Evolution) in the 2001 AP Biology 
Laboratory Manual. Students often find the study of population genetics challenging 
because most lab simulations in which students try to manipulate a population that is 
evolving are flawed, as the population is so small that genetic drift swamps any factors 
that promote evolution. Fortunately, the complexity of evolution in populations is 
illuminated by relatively simple mathematical equations, several of which are based on 
the Hardy-Weinberg (H-W) equilibrium formula. In this revise
