3.3.3 Solution and Result 
Since we assume that if the peak of infective rate is under 0.2, the epidemic 
situation can be under control, then a=-0.0055, b=0.0025. 
From the model analysis we get the numerical result as follows. By the 
above-mentioned can be obtained, the infection rate of Ebola virus obviously 
slow down, after using the drugs, we also significantly curb its spread.

3.3.4 Analysis of the Result 
From this figure, we can see the infective rate I(t)
（the blue line in the figure）
and the susceptible rate(the green line in the figure) changes with time. 
Compare with Improved ModelⅠ, drugs are taken int
