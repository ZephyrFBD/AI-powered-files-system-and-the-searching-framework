7 for lighting a flashlight bulb with a
flashlight battery and a single wire?
RESPONSE (a) There is no closed path for charge to flow around. Charges
might briefly start to flow from the battery toward the lightbulb, but there they
run into a “dead end,” and the flow would immediately come to a stop.
(b) Now there is a closed path passing to and from the lightbulb; but the wire
touches only one battery terminal, so there is no potential difference in the cir-
cuit to make the charge move. Neither here, nor in (a), does the bulb light up.
(c) Nothing is wrong here. This is a complete circuit: charge can flow out from
one terminal of the battery, through the wire and the bulb, and into the other
terminal. This scheme will light the bulb.
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 18;2
In many real circuits, wires are connected to a common conductor that pro-
vides continuity. This common conductor is called ground, usually represented as
or 
, and really is connected to the ground for a building or house. In a
