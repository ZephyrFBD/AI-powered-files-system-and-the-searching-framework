celeration due to gravity at the Earth’s new 
surface would equal the acceleration due to gravity at the
surface of the Sun?
88. A science-fiction tale describes an artificial “planet” in the
form of a band completely encircling a sun (Fig. 5–50). The
inhabitants live on the inside surface (where it is always
noon). Imagine that this sun is exactly like our own, that
the distance to the band is the same as the Earth–Sun
distance (to make the climate livable), and that the ring
rotates quickly enough to produce an apparent gravity of g
as on Earth. What will be the period of revolution, this
planet’s year, in Earth days?

74. Consider a train that rounds a curve with a radius of 
570 m at a speed of 
(approximately 
).
(a) Calculate the friction force needed on a train pas-
senger of mass 55 kg if the track is not banked and the
train does not tilt. (b) Calculate the friction force on 
the passenger if the train tilts at an angle of 8.0° toward the
center of the
