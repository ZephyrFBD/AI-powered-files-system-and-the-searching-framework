he emission of a photon. At room
temperature, unless extra energy is supplied (as in a discharge tube), the vast
majority of atoms are in the ground state.
We can continue in this way to describe the quantum numbers of each elec-
tron in the ground state of larger and larger atoms. The quantum numbers for
sodium, with its eleven electrons, are shown in Table 28–2.
EXERCISE E Construct a Table of the ground-state quantum numbers for beryllium,
(like those in Table 28–2).
Figure 28–10 shows a simple energy level diagram where occupied states are
shown as up or down arrows 
and possible empty states are
shown as a small circle.
