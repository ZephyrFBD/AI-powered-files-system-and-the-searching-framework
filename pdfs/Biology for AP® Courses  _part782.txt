and reduction usually occur together, these pairs of reactions are called oxidation reduction reactions, or redox reactions.
Electrons and Energy
The removal of an electron from a molecule, oxidizing it, results in a decrease in potential energy in the oxidized compound.
The electron (sometimes as part of a hydrogen atom), does not remain unbonded, however, in the cytoplasm of a cell.
Rather, the electron is shifted to a second compound, reducing the second compound. The shift of an electron from one
compound to another removes some potential energy from the first compound (the oxidized compound) and increases the
potential energy of the second compound (the reduced compound). The transfer of electrons between molecules is important
because most of the energy stored in atoms and used to fuel cell functions is in the form of high-energy electrons.
