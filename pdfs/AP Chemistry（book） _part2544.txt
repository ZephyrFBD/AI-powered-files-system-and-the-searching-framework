16.5 ∣ Strong Acids and Bases
The chemistry of an aqueous solution often depends critically on pH. It is therefore 
important to examine how pH relates to acid and base concentrations. The simplest cases 
are those involving strong acids and strong bases. Strong acids and bases are strong elec-
trolytes, existing in aqueous solution entirely as ions. There are relatively few common 
strong acids and bases (see Table 4.2).
Strong Acids
The seven most common strong acids include six monoprotic acids (HCl, HBr,  
HI, HNO3, HClO3, and HClO4), and one diprotic acid 1H2SO42. Nitric acid 1HNO32 exem-
plifies the behavior of the monoprotic strong acids. For all practical purposes, an aque-
ous solution of HNO3 consists entirely of H3O+ and NO3
- ions:
