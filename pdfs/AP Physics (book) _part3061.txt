rgy-level diagram. This is shown for hydrogen in Fig. 27–29. The electron in a
hydrogen atom can be in any one of these levels according to Bohr theory. But it
could never be in between, say at 
At room temperature, nearly all 
H atoms will be in the ground state 
At higher temperatures, or during
an electric discharge when there are many collisions between free electrons and
atoms, many atoms can be in excited states 
Once in an excited state, an
atom’s electron can jump down to a lower state, and give off a photon in the
process. This is, according to the Bohr model, the origin of the emission spectra
of excited gases.
Note that above
an electron is free and can have any energy (E is
not quantized). Thus there is a continuum of energy states above
as indi-
cated in the energy-level diagram of Fig. 27–29.
