d various combinations of them create molecules, which combine to form
organelles, cells, tissues, organ system, and organisms. Atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons, are the
smallest units of matter that retain all their characteristics and are most stable when their outermost or valence electron
shells contain the maximum number of electrons. Electrons can be transferred, shared, or cause charge disparities between
atoms to create bonds, including ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds, as well as van del Waals interactions. Isotopes are
different forms of an element that have different numbers of neutrons while retaining the same number of protons; many
isotopes, such as carbon-14, are radioactive.
