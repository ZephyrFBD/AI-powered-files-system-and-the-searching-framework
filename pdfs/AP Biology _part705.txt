long an axon in one direction only since the impulse can
move only to a region where the membrane is polarized. Figure 16.6
shows the axon of a neuron as an impulse action potential passes from left
to right, depolarizing the membrane in front of it. (Also, review Figure
3.16, which illustrates the sodium-potassium pump.)
The action potential is like a row of dominoes falling in order after the
first one is knocked over. The first action potential generates a second
action potential, which generates a third, and so on. The impulse moves
along the axon propagating itself without losing any strength. If the axon is
large or myelinated, the impulse travels faster. This occurs for two reasons.
First, the myelin reduces ion leakage. Second, because voltage-gated

channels are located on the nodes, the impulse leaps from node to node
(Ranvier) in saltatory (jumping) fashion.
