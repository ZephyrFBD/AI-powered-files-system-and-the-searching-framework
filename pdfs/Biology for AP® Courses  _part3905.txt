llsâ€™ resistance to infection. One
effect of interferon-induced gene expression is a sharply reduced cellular protein synthesis. Virally infected cells produce
more viruses by synthesizing large quantities of viral proteins. Thus, by reducing protein synthesis, a cell becomes resistant
to viral infection.

Figure 33.4 Interferons are cytokines that are released by a cell infected with a virus. Response of neighboring cells
to interferon helps stem the infection.
Phagocytosis and Inflammation
The first cytokines to be produced are pro-inflammatory; that is, they encourage inflammation, the localized redness,
swelling, heat, and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries
to a site of infection. The population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting
pathogen. Both macrophages and dendritic cells engulf pathogens and cellular debris through phagocytosi
