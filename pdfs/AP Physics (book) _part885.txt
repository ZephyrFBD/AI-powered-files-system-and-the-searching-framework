Rotational Motion
42. (II) A 0.72-m-diameter solid sphere can be rotated about
an axis through its center by a torque of 
which
accelerates it uniformly from rest through a total of
160 revolutions in 15.0 s. What is the mass of the sphere?
43. (II) Let us treat a helicopter rotor blade as a long thin 
rod, as shown in Fig. 8–49. (a) If each of the three rotor
helicopter blades is 3.75 m long and has a mass of 135 kg,
calculate the moment of inertia of the three rotor blades
about the axis of rotation. (b) How much torque must the
