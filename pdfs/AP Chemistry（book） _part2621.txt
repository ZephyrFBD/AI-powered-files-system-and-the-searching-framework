One electron pair of one of the carbon–oxygen double bonds is moved onto the oxygen, 
leaving a vacant orbital on the carbon, which means the carbon can accept an electron 
pair donated by H2O. The initial acid–base product rearranges by transferring a proton 
from the water oxygen to a carbon dioxide oxygen, forming carbonic acid.
The hydrated cations we encountered in Section 16.9, such as 3Fe1H2O2643+ in Fig-
ure 16.18, form through the reaction between the cation acting as a Lewis acid and the 
water molecules acting as Lewis bases. When a water molecule interacts with the posi-
tively charged metal ion, electron density is drawn from the oxygen (Figure 16.21). This 
flow of electron density causes the O ¬H bond to become more polarized; as a result, 
water molecules bound to the metal ion are more acidic than those in the bulk solvent. 
This effect becomes more pronounced as the charge of the cation increases, which 
explain
