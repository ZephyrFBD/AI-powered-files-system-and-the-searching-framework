 Frankie. Dead. And where is your 
 
 father? She lets my hand drop. I said where is your father? Drinking. 
 
 That’s where he is.There isn’t a penny in the house. He can’t get a job 
 
 but he finds money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the 
 
  
  
 drink, money for the drink. She rears back, knocks her head on the 
 
 wall and screams,Where is she? Where is she? Where is my little girl? 
 
 Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me this night. I’ll go mad, so I will, 
 
 I’ll go pure mad. 
 
 Mrs. Leibowitz rushes in. Missus, missus, what is it? The little girl. 
 
 Where is she? 
 
 My mother screams again, Dead, Mrs. Leibowitz. Dead. Her head 
 
 drops and she rocks back and forth. Middle of the night,Mrs.Leibowitz. 
 
 In her pram. I should have been watching her. Seven weeks she had in 
 
 37 
 
 this world and died in the middle of the night, alone,Mrs. Leibowitz, 
 
 all alone in that pram. 
 
 Mrs. Leibowitz holds my mother in her arms. Shush, now, shush.
