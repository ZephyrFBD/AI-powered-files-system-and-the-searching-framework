g that cause at least half of
the species to die out in a relatively short amount of time. Following mass
extinctions, new life-forms may emerge and evolve as new habitats open
via adaptive radiation. Five major mass extinction events occurred on
Earth in prehistoric times: Ordovician-Silurian Extinction (small marine
organisms died out), Devonian Extinction (tropical marine species died
out), Permian-Triassic Extinction (many vertebrates died out), Triassic-
Jurassic Extinction (dinosaurs flourished aȇer other species died out),
and Cretaceous-Tertiary Extinction (dinosaurs died out). The extinction of
the dinosaurs made room for other animals to diversify and evolve
rapidly.
Evidence for Evolution
TYPES OF EVIDENCE
Even though evolution is sometimes described as a “theory,” it is more
than a mere hypothesis. A wealth of evidence from a variety of fields
indicates that evolution is a well-established scientific fact.
