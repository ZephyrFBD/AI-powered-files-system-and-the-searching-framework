to
plane-polarized and reduces the intensity from 
to 
The second 
polarizer further reduces the intensity by 
Eq. 24–5:
The light leaving the second polarizer is plane-polarized at 45° (Fig. 24–45b)
relative to the third polarizer, so the third one reduces the intensity to
or
Thus of the original intensity gets transmitted.
NOTE If we don’t insert the 45° Polaroid, zero intensity results (Fig. 24–43).
EXERCISE F How much light would pass through if the 45° polarizer in Example 24–14
was placed not between the other two polarizers but (a) before the vertical (first) 
polarizer, or (b) after the horizontal polarizer?
Polarization by Reflection
Another means of producing polarized light from unpolarized light is by 
reflection. When light strikes a nonmetallic surface at any angle other than 
perpendicular, the reflected beam is polarized preferentially in the plane parallel
to the surface, Fig. 24–46. In other words, the component with polarization in the
plane perpendicular to the surf
