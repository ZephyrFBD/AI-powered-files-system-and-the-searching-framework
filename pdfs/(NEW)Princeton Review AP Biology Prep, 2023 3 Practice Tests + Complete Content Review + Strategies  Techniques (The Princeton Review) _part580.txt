If substance F leads to the inhibition of enzyme 3, then substances D and E and enzymes 3, 4, and 5 will be
affected. The activity of enzyme 6 will be increased, not decreased, which will therefore increase substance X.
The activity of enzyme 5 will be decreased, not increased.

C
If enzyme 6 were inhibited, then everything that comes after that in the pathway would be reduced. Proteins A
and C come before enzyme 6, and Protein F will be increased, not decreased.

C
Based on the graph, fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than maternal hemoglobin. Fetal
hemoglobin does not give up oxygen more readily than maternal hemoglobin, so eliminate (A). You can also
get rid of (B), as the dissociation curve of fetal hemoglobin is to the left of the maternal hemoglobin. Finally,
eliminate (D) because fetal hemoglobin and maternal hemoglobin are different structurally, but you can’t tell
this from the graph.
