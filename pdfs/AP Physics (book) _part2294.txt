5. The force on a moving particle in a magnetic field is the idea
behind electromagnetic pumping. It can be used to pump
metallic fluids (such as sodium) and to pump blood in
artificial heart machines. A basic design is shown in
Fig. 20–76. For blood, an electric field is applied perpen-
dicular to a blood vessel and to the magnetic field. Explain
in detail how ions in the blood are ca
