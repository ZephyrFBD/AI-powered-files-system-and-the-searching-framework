or ATP as
a neurotransmitter. Based on the fact that ATP has been
conserved throughout evolution of life on Earth justify
such a role for ATP. Based on these two perspectives
analyze the role of cooperative interactions in the positive
selection of ATP as a neurotransmitter.
37. Neurons and muscle cells maintain a high
concentration gradient of potassium ions across the plasma
membrane. The extracellular space has a high
concentration of sodium ions. At the rest electric potential
the cell membrane is polarized.
A. Construct a representation of the cell membrane with
annotation of the diagram below that includes the
following:
•
with a labeled arrow indicate the direction in which
the motion of potassium ions is driven by the
concentration gradient
•
with a labeled arrow indicate the direction in which
the motion of sodium ions is driven by the
concentration gradient
•
give a brief statement of the roles of potassium and
sodium ion pumps in maintaining the rest electric
potential
•
