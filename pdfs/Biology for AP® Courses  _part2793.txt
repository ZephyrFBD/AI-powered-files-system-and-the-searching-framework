s) and
an eastern North America forest ecosystem (253 species in
90 genera and 46 families) had no species in common, but
there were 20 common genera and 40 common families.
Actual evapotranspiration for the two ecosystems are 850
± 200 mm (eastern North America) and 730 ± 160 mm
(eastern Asia).

113. The evolution of vascular plants followed the
colonization of terrestrial habitats by ancestors of
Chlorophyta, green algae, during the Devonian period
(which began about 400 million years ago). The three most
significant structural innovations in that process are
responses to selection through the availability of water
resources: 1) the cuticle, a waxy covering of the epidermis
that retains water; 2) stomata, openings that penetrate the
cuticle through which water and carbon dioxide are
transported; and 3) a vascular system, plant tissues through
which water moves.
