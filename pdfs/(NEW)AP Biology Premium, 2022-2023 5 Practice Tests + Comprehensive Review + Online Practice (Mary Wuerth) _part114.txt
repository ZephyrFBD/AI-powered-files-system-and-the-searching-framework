Plant cells may contain amyloplasts, as shown in Figure 5.10. Excess glucose produced by photosynthesis is
stored as starch molecules in the amyloplasts. Amyloplasts are frequently found in the root and tubers of starchy
vegetables, such as potatoes.

There are several other structures found in both plant and animal cells. The peroxisome helps oxidize molecules
and break down toxins in the cell. The nucleolus is not a membrane-bound organelle; that term refers to the region
in the nucleus where ribosomes are assembled. Cytoskeleton fibers help give cells their shape and can be used to
move items in the cell. Figure 5.11 shows the cellular organelles that are typically found in plant and animal cells.

Endosymbiosis Hypothesis
How did the membrane-bound organelles in eukaryotes originate? The leading theory to explain the origin of
membrane-bound organelles is the endosymbiosis hypothesis. The endosymbiosis hypothesis states that m
