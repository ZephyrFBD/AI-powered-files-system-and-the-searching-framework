 C and O balanced (Step 2a). We balance the 
charge (Step 2d) by adding two electrons to the products:
 
C2O4
2-1aq2 ยก 2 CO21g2 + 2 e- 
We can check this result using oxidation states. Carbon goes from the +3 oxidation 
state in C2O4
2- to the +4 oxidation state in CO2. Thus, each C atom loses one electron; 
therefore, the two C atoms in C2O4
2- lose two electrons, in agreement with our balanced 
half-reaction.
Now we multiply each half-reaction by an appropriate integer so that the number 
of electrons gained in one half-reaction equals the number of electrons lost in the other 
(Step 3). We multiply the MnO4
- half-reaction by 2 and the C2O4
2- half-reaction by 5:
10 e- + 16 H+1aq2 + 2 MnO4
-1aq2 ยก 2 Mn2+1aq2 + 8 H2O1l2
 5 C2O4
2-1aq2 ยก 10 CO21g2 + 10 e-
16 H+1aq2 + 2 MnO4
-1aq2 + 5 C2O4
2-1aq2 ยก 2 Mn2+1aq2 + 8 H2O1l2 + 10 CO21g2
The balanced equation is the sum of the balanced half-reactions (Step 4). Note that the 
electrons on the reactant and product sides of the equation cancel
