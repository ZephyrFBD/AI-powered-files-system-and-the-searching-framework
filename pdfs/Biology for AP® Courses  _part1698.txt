lps to establish the initiation site for
transcription
strand of DNA that specifies the complementary mRNA molecule
region of locally unwound DNA that allows for transcription of mRNA
nucleotides preceding the initiation site; in general, sequences toward the 5' end relative to a site on the mRNA
CHAPTER SUMMARY
15.1 The Genetic Code
The genetic code refers to the DNA alphabet (A, T, C, G), the RNA alphabet (A, U, C, G), and the polypeptide alphabet
(20 amino acids). The Central Dogma describes the flow of genetic information in the cell from genes to mRNA to
proteins. Genes are used to make mRNA by the process of transcription; mRNA is used to synthesize proteins by the
process of translation. The genetic code is degenerate because 64 triplet codons in mRNA specify only 20 amino acids and
three nonsense codons. Almost every species on the planet uses the same genetic code.
15.2 Prokaryotic Transcription
In prokaryotes, mRNA synthesis is initiated at a promoter sequence on the DNA temp
