revents the enzyme from catalyzing the substrate.
4. In noncompetitive inhibition, a substance inhibits the action of an enzyme by binding to the enzyme at a location
other than the active site (i.e., allosteric site). The inhibitor changes the shape of the enzyme which disables its
enzymatic activity. Many toxins and antibiotics are noncompetitive inhibitors.
5. In cooperativity, an enzyme becomes more receptive to additional substrate molecules after one substrate
molecule attaches to an active site. This occurs, for example, in enzymes that consist of two or more subunits
(quaternary structure), each with its own active site. A common example of this process (though not an enzyme) is
hemoglobin, whose binding capacity to additional oxygen molecules increases after the first oxygen binds to an
active site.
