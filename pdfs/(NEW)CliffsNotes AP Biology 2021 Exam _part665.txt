apacity as limiting factors exert negative feedback on population
growth when the population size is large. When the population size is small, limiting factors exert little negative
feedback, and population growth renews.

Figure 16-6 shows population cycles in the snowshoe hare and its predator the lynx. Since changes in the number of
hares are regularly followed by similar changes in the number of lynx, it may appear that predation limits hare
populations and that food supply limits lynx populations. Such fluctuation cycles are commonly observed between
predator and prey. However, the data in Figure 16-6 indicate only an association between the two animalsâ€™
populations, not that one population causes an effect in the other population. In fact, additional data suggest that the
population size in hares is more closely related to the amount of available food (grass), which, in turn, is determined
by seasonal rainfall levels.
