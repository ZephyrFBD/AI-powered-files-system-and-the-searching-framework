Two components of acceleration. A race car starts from
rest in the pit area and accelerates at a uniform rate to a speed of 
in 
moving on a circular track of radius 500 m. Assuming constant tangential 
acceleration, find (a) the tangential acceleration, and (b) the radial acceler-
ation, at the instant when the speed is  
APPROACH The tangential acceleration relates to the change in speed of the car,
and can be calculated as  
The centripetal acceleration relates to the
change in the direction of the velocity vector and is calculated using
SOLUTION (a) During the 11-s time interval, we assume the tangential accel-
eration 
is constant. Its magnitude is
(b) When
the centripetal acceleration is
NOTE The radial (centripetal) acceleration increases continually, whereas the
tangential acceleration stays constant.
