lution. (EVO-1 & SYI-2)
(A) From the description, you learn that watermilfoil represents a
huge biomass in the lake. Once it is killed, there will be massive
decomposition by bacteria in the lake. Decomposition uses up
oxygen which, in turn, threatens the fish population. Also, consider
that this change is sudden, brought about by human intervention.
There is no time for fish to acclimatize. (EVO-1 & SYI-2)
