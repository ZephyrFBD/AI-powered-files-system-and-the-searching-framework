riments. Make sure you
understand all the basic points of an experiment—testing a
hypothesis, setting up an experiment properly to isolate a
particular variable, and so on—so that you will be able to breeze
through these questions when you come to them.
Questions with Graphs
Most graph questions require a bit of biology knowledge to determine
what the right answer is, but some graph questions only test whether or
not you can read a graph properly. If you can make sense of the vertical
and horizontal axes, then you can determine what the correct answer is.
Granted, very few graph questions are this easy but, even so, it’s nice to
have a slam-dunk question or two. Therefore, if you see a graph, look at
the problem and see if you can answer the question just by knowing how
to read a graph.
Computational Questions
To help with the more quantitative problems on the AP Biology exam,
you will be allowed to use a basic four-function, scientific, or graphing
calculator on both sections of the e
