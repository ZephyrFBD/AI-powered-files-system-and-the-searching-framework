ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES
Bullet Sex-linked genes reside 
on sex chromosomes.
Bullet In mammals and flies, 
females are XX and 
males are XY; as such, 
X-linked recessive traits 
are always expressed in 
males.
Bullet In certain species, the 
chromosomal basis 
of sex determination 
is not based on X 
and Y chromosomes 
(such as ZW in birds, 
haplodiploidy in bees).

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-1.J
Explain deviations from 
Mendel’s model of the 
inheritance of traits.
IST-1.J.4
Some traits result from non-nuclear 
inheritance—
a. Chloroplasts and mitochondria are randomly 
assorted to gametes and daughter cells; 
thus, traits determined by chloroplast and 
mitochondrial DNA do not follow simple 
Mendelian rules.
b. In animals, mitochondria are transmitted by 
the egg
