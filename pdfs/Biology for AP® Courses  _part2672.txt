n shoots and leaves are growing, plants are able to
produce their own food by photosynthesizing. The products of photosynthesis are called photosynthates, which are usually
in the form of simple sugars such as sucrose.
Structures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources. Sugars produced in sources, such
as leaves, need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation. The points of
sugar delivery, such as roots, young shoots, and developing seeds, are called sinks. Seeds, tubers, and bulbs can be either a
source or a sink, depending on the plantâ€™s stage of development and the season.
The products from the source are usually translocated to the nearest sink through the phloem. For example, the highest
leaves will send photosynthates upward to the growing shoot tip, whereas lower leaves will direct photosynthates downward
to the roots. Intermediate leaves will send products in both directions, unlike the fl
