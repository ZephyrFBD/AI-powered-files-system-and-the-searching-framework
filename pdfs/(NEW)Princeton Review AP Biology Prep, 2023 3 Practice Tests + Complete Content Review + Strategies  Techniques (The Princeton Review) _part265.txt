 is
constantly working to maintain this state by taking measurements and then responding appropriately. That might
mean shivering if it is cold or releasing the hormone insulin if blood glucose is high. Depending on the condition,
the body will respond accordingly.
Your blood glucose levels are regulated by insulin and glucagon, two
hormones released from your pancreas. For example, when youâ€™ve just eaten,
blood sugar levels are high, and this stimulates insulin release. The cells of
your body take up glucose and hepatocytes in your liver store extra glucose,
as glycogen. Blood sugar levels go down, your body reestablishes
homeostasis, and insulin release is shut off via negative feedback.
Many of these responses are controlled by negative or positive feedback pathways. A negative feedback pathway
(also called feedback inhibition) works by turning itself off using the end product of the pathway. The end product
inhibits the process from beginning, thus shutting down the pathway. This i
