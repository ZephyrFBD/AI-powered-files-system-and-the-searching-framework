ns, repressor proteins can bind to the operator without the assistance of a corepressor. In
repressible operons, the presence of a corepressor is required in order for the repressor protein to bind to the
operator sequence. Choice (A) is incorrect because both inducible and repressible operons have promoter
sequences. Operator sequences are present in both inducible and repressible operons, so choice (B) is incorrect.
RNA polymerase does not require a corepressor in order to bind to the promoter in both inducible and
repressible operons, so choice (D) is incorrect.
5. (B) Lactose is an inducer for the lac operon, so high levels of lactose would pull the repressor protein off of the
operator, increasing expression of the lac operon. Low levels of glucose would cause higher levels of cyclic
AMP, which would activate the catabolite activator protein, upregulating the expression of the lac operon. Low
levels of lactose would not result in high levels of lac operon expression, so choices (A
