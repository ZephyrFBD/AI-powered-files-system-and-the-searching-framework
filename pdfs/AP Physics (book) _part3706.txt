ctive force between all masses, and there are large
accumulations of mass in the universe. The force of gravity as Newton described
it in his law of universal gravitation was modified by Einstein. In his general
theory of relativity, Einstein developed a theory of gravity that now forms the
basis of cosmological dynamics.
In the special theory of relativity (Chapter 26), Einstein concluded that there
is no way for an observer to determine whether a given frame of reference is at
rest or is moving at constant velocity in a straight line. Thus the laws of physics
must be the same in different inertial reference frames. But what about the more
general case of motion where reference frames can be accelerating?
Einstein tackled the problem of accelerating reference frames in his general
theory of relativity and in it also developed a theory of gravity. The mathematics
of General Relativity is complex, so our discussion will be mainly qualitative.
We begin with Einsteinâ€™s principle of equiva
