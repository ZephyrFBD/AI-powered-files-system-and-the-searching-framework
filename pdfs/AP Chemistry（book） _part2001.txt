¬ n. Draw the structure of the monomer.
 12.88  Write the chemical equation that represents the formation of
(a) polychloroprene from chloroprene (polychloroprene is 
used in highway-pavement seals, expansion joints, con-
veyor belts, and wire and cable jackets)
 12.89  The polymer Kevlar, a condensation polymer, is used as re-
inforcement in car tires, strings of archery bows, and as a 
component of bulletproof vests.
