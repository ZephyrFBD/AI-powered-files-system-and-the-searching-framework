to have yellow flowers (pp). However, 
the OBSERVED offspring values from the cross were 87 purple (Pp) and 59 yellow (pp). 
These values can be put in a chart as follows: 
The chi-square formula is Х2 = ∑ (o-e)2 /e, or, for this cross, 2.68 + 2.68 = 5.36 for the null 
hypothesis. The critical value for p=0.05 with one degree of freedom is 3.84. Since 5.36 
is greater than 3.84, the null hypothesis that the purple parent was heterozygous for the 
flower-color gene is rejected.
