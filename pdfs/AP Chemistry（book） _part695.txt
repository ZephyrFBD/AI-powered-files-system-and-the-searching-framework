ot know the numerical value of a system’s internal energy. In thermodynamics, we are 
mainly concerned with the change in E (and, as we shall see, changes in other quantities as 
well) that accompanies a change in the system.
Imagine that we start with a system with an initial internal energy Einitial. The system 
then undergoes a change, which might involve work being done or heat being transferred. 
After the change, the final internal energy of the system is Efinal. We define the change in 
internal energy, denoted ∆E (read “delta E”),* as the difference between Efinal and Einitial:
 
∆E = Efinal - Einitial 
[5.3]
We generally cannot determine the actual values of Efinal and Einitial for any system of 
practical interest. Nevertheless, we can determine the value of ∆E experimentally by 
 
applying the first law of thermodynamics.
Thermodynamic quantities such as ∆E have three parts:
1. a number
2. a unit
3. a sign
(1) and (2) together give the magnitude of the change, while (3) give
