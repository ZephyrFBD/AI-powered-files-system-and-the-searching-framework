70. Until recently, these three species of short-tailed
pythons, Python curtus, Python brongersmai (middle), and
Python breitensteini were considered one species.
However, due to the different locations in which they are
found, they have become three distinct species. What is
this an example of?
a.
divergent evolution
b.
sympatric speciation
c.
allopatric speciation
d.
variation
71. Consider two species of birds that diverged while
separated geographically but resumed their contact before
reproductive isolation was complete. Which describes the
first step in what would happen over time if the two

species mated extensively and their hybrid offspring
survived and reproduced more poorly than offspring from
intra-species matings?
a.
Natural selection would cause prezygotic
barriers to reproduction between the parent
species to strengthen over time.
b.
The production of unfit hybrids would increase
and the speciation process would comple
