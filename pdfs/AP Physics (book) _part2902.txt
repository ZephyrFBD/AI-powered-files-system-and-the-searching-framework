 himself:
“What would I see if I rode a light beam?” The answer was that instead of a trav-
eling electromagnetic wave, he would see alternating electric and magnetic fields
at rest whose magnitude changed in space, but did not change in time. Such fields,
he realized, had never been detected and indeed were not consistent with Maxwell’s
electromagnetic theory. He argued, therefore, that it was unreasonable to think
that the speed of light relative to any observer could be reduced to zero, or in fact
reduced at all. This idea became the second postulate of his theory of relativity.
In his famous 1905 paper, Einstein proposed doing away with the idea of the
ether and the accompanying assumption of a preferred or absolute reference frame
at rest. This proposal was embodied in two postulates. The first was an extension 
of the Galilean–Newtonian relativity principle to include not only the laws of
mechanics but also those of the rest of physics, including electricity and magnetism:
