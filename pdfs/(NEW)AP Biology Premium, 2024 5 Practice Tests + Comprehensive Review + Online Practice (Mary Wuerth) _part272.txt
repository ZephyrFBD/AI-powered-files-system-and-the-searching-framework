 II), there
would be constantly high levels of MPF in the cell. Mitosis would constantly be stimulated, and the cell
would divide uncontrollably.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) The null hypothesis is that there is no statistically significant difference between the number of cells in
interphase and the number of cells in mitosis in the untreated cells compared to the number of cells in
interphase and the number of cells in mitosis in the cells treated with caffeine.
(b) The independent variable is the presence of caffeine. The dependent variable is the number of cells in
interphase or mitosis.
(c)
There are four possible outcomes to the experiment, so there are 3 degrees of freedom (df = number of
possible outcomes â€“ 1).
Using a p-value of 0.05, the critical value from the chi-square table is 7.81. Based on these calculations,
there is likely a statistically significant difference between the two groups of onions.
(d) Since the calculated chi-square value of 14.432 is greater than the crit
