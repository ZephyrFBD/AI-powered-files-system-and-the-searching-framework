. (C) is incorrect because those
with MFS produce less fibrillin-1 due to a genetic mutation than those that
do not have MFS. (D) Production of fibrillin-1 is not dependent on the
phenotype. The organism’s phenotype will be influenced by the lack,
overabundance, or adequate amount of fibrillin-1 being produced by the
cells.
18. B
The question stem asks what will increase cAMP levels in the cell, and so
(B) is the correct answer since PDE degrades cAMP. Inhibiting the
phosphorylation of PDE by PKA will mean less PDE activity, and thus
higher cAMP levels in the cell. (A) is incorrect because there is no PKA
phosphorylation site on cAMP, since cAMP is not a protein. This will have
no eﬀect on cAMP levels. (C) is incorrect because the dissociation of PKA is
required for PKA’s catalytic actions, but not for cAMP generation, so this
will not directly aﬀect cAMP levels. (D) is incorrect because the binding of
adenylyl cyclase to the Gs alpha subunit is required for cAMP generation,
and so blo
