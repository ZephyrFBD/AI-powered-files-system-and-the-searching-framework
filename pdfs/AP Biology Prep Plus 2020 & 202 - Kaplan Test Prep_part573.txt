 in the sequence
remain unchanged; the only diï¬€erence is that the fourth codon
becomes a stop signal. (C) is incorrect because the protein is made
shorter, not longer. (D) is incorrect because a change in fact occurred:
the peptide sequence was made shorter.

The most likely reason for an mRNA sequence to be far longer than an
active protein is some type of post-translational modification that
excises a segment of the protein. (A) thus provides the best
explanation. (B) is incorrect because insulin is secreted into the
bloodstream, as noted in the question stem, not embedded in a
membrane. (C) is incorrect because the question stem suggests that
the excised region is an inactive peptide; a dimer would be split into
two active proteins. (D) is incorrect because it would be redundant and
a waste of energy to split up the protein into amino acids and then
reassemble it.
