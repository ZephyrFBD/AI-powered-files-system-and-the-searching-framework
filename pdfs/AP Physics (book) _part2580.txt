wo lenses.
APPROACH Starting at the tip of our object O, we draw rays 1, 2, and 3 for the
first lens, A, and also a ray 4 which, after passing through lens A, acts for the
second lens, B, as ray 
(through the center). We use primes now for the standard
rays relative to lens B. Ray 2 for lens A exits parallel, and so is ray 
for lens B.
To determine the position of the image 
formed by lens A, we use Eq. 23–8
with 
and
The distance of 
(lens A’s image)
from lens B is the object distance 
for lens B. The final image is found using
the thin lens equation, this time with all distances relative to lens B. For (b) the
magnifications are found from Eq. 23–9 for each lens in turn.
SOLUTION (a) The object is a distance
from the first lens, A,
and this lens forms an image whose position can be calculated using the thin lens
equation:
So the first image 
is at
behind the first lens. This image
becomes the object for the second lens,
B.
It is a
distance 
in front of lens B (Fig. 23–44b). The image
