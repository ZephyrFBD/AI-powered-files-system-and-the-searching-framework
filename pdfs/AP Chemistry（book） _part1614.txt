e kinetic energy of the molecules, (b) their average speed, (c) the number of collisions they make with the container 
walls per unit time, (d) the number of collisions they make with a unit area of container wall per unit time, (e) the pressure?
SOLUTION
Analyze We need to apply the concepts of the kinetic-molecular 
theory of gases to a gas compressed at constant temperature.
Plan We will determine how each of the quantities in (a)â€“(e) is  
affected by the change in volume at constant temperature.
Solve (a) Because the average kinetic energy of the O2 molecules 
is determined only by temperature, this energy is unchanged by 
the compression. (b) Because the average kinetic energy of the 
molecules does not change, their average speed remains constant. 
(c) The number of collisions with the walls per unit time increases 
because the molecules are moving in a smaller volume but with 
the same average speed as before. Under these conditions they will 
strike the walls of the container m
