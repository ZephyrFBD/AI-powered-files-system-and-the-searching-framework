for gross productivity of the primary producers is the same as the value for total heat and
respiration ( 20, 810 kcal/ m2 / yr )?
a.
Total heat and respiration refers to the energy used by all trophic levels and the energy provided by the
primary producers is more than the energy provided by primary consumers to these levels.
b.
Gross productivity of primary producers is the same as the value for total heat and respiration because of the
high efficiency of conversion of solar energy to energy used by all trophic levels by primary producers.
c.
The value for gross productivity of primary producers and total heat and respiration is same as primary
producers provide energy to primary consumers and secondary consumers only.
d.
Total heat and respiration refers to energy used by all trophic levels and the only accessible energy to these
