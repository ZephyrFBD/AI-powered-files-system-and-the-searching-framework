rror.) When a narrow beam of light shines on a mirror, the light 
will not reach your eye unless your eye is positioned at just the right place where
the law of reflection is satisfied, as shown in Fig. 23–4b. This is what gives rise to
the special image-forming properties of mirrors.

FIGURE 23–4 A narrow beam of light shines on (a) white paper, and (b) a mirror. In part (a),
you can see with your eye the white light (and printed words) reflected at various positions
because of diffuse reflection. But in part (b), you see the reflected light only when your eye is
placed correctly 
mirror reflection is also known as specular reflection. (Galileo, using
similar arguments, showed that the Moon must have a rough surface rather than a highly
polished surface
