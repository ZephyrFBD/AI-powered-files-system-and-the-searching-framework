We know these things don’t happen in real life; they are processes in which order
increases—or entropy decreases. They violate the second law of thermodynam-
ics. When watching a movie (or imagining that time could go backward), we are
tipped off to a reversal of time by observing whether entropy (and disorder) is
increasing or decreasing. Hence, entropy has been called time’s arrow, because it can
tell us in which direction time is going.

Heat Death
In the process of heat conduction from a hot object to a cold one, we have seen
that entropy increases and that order goes to disorder. The separate hot and cold
objects could serve as the high- and low-temperature regions for a heat engine
and thus could be used to obtain useful work. But after the two objects are put in
contact with each other and reach the same uniform temp
