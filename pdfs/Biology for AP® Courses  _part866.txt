e rate of operation of the pathway at
this point is not necessarily negative, as the increased levels of the Î±-ketoglutarate not used by the citric acid cycle can be
used by the cell for amino acid (glutamate) synthesis.
Electron Transport Chain
Specific enzymes of the electron transport chain are unaffected by feedback inhibition, but the rate of electron transport
through the pathway is affected by the levels of ADP and ATP. Greater ATP consumption by a cell is indicated by a buildup
of ADP. As ATP usage decreases, the concentration of ADP decreases, and now, ATP begins to build up in the cell. This
change in the relative concentration of ADP to ATP triggers the cell to slow down the electron transport chain.
