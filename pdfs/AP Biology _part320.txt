ained by the
enzyme telomerase. Normal body cells contain little telomerase, so
every time the DNA replicates, the telomeres get shorter. This may
serve as a clock that counts cell divisions and causes the cell to stop
dividing as the cell ages.

FROM DNA TO PROTEIN
The process whereby DNA makes proteins has been worked out in great
detail. To summarize, the triplet code in DNA is transcribed into a
codon sequence in messenger-RNA (mRNA) inside the nucleus. Next,
this newly formed strand of RNA, known as pre-RNA, is processed or
modified in the nucleus. Then the codon sequence leaves the nucleus and
is translated into an amino acid sequence (a polypeptide) in the cytoplasm
at the ribosome.

Genetic information flows from a sequence of nucleotides in a gene to a sequence of
amino acids in a protein.
If the strand of DNA triplets to be transcribed is
5′-AAA TAA CCG
GAC-3′
Then the strand of mRNA codons that forms is
3′-UUU AUU GGC
