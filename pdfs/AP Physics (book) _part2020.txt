ice, you observe that the current increases by a factor
of 3. What can you conclude?
(a) Ohm’s law is obeyed, because the current increases
when V increases.
(b) Ohm’s law is not obeyed in this case.
(c) This situation has nothing to do with Ohm’s law.
10. Nothing happens when birds land on a power line, yet we
are warned not to touch a power line with a ladder. What
is the difference?
(a) Birds have extremely high internal resistance 
compared to humans.
(b) There is little to no voltage drop between a bird’s two
feet, but there is a significant voltage drop between
the top of a ladder touching a power line and the
bottom of the ladder on the ground.
(c) Dangerous current comes from the ground only.
(d) Most birds don’t understand the situation.
11. When a light switch is turned on, the light comes on imme-
diately because
(a) the electrons coming from the power source move
through the initially empty wires very fast.
(b) the electrons already in the wire are instantly “pushed”
by a v
