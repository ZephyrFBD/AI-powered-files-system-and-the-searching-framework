Subtropical Deserts
Subtropical deserts exist between 15 ° and 30 ° north and south latitude and are centered on the Tropics of Cancer and
Capricorn (Figure 35.12). This biome is very dry; in some years, evaporation exceeds precipitation. Subtropical hot deserts
can have daytime soil surface temperatures above 60 °C (140 °F) and nighttime temperatures approaching 0 °C (32 °F). In
cold deserts, temperatures can be as high as 25 °C and can drop below -30 °C (-22 °F). Subtropical deserts are characterized
by low annual precipitation of fewer than 30 cm (12 in) with little monthly variation and lack of predictability in rainfall.
In some cases, the annual rainfall can be as low as 2 cm (0.8 in) in subtropical deserts located in central Australia (“the
Outback”) and northern Africa.
The vegetation and low animal diversity of this biome is closely related to this low and unpredictable precipitation. Very dry
deserts lack perennial vegetation th
