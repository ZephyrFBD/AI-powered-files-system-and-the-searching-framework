 not account for the great amount of genetic variation in a
population. The mixing of genes through sexual reproduction also contributes to genetic variation. During meiosis,
crossing-over mixes alleles among homologous chromosomes, and independent assortment when chromosomes are
packaged further adds to the genetic uniqueness of each gamete.
It might be hard to think of it in this way, but genetic variation is the very foundation of evolution, as we’ll soon see.
Now that we’ve reintroduced genes, we can refine our definition of evolution. More specifically:
Evolution is the change in the gene pool of a population over time.
The Peppered Moths
Let’s look at an example. During the 1850s in England, there was a large population of peppered moths. In most
areas, exactly half of them were dark and carried alleles for dark coloring. The other half were light and carried
alleles for light coloring. This 1:1 ratio of phenotypes was observed until air pollution, due primarily to the burning
of
