Charged particles, such as and rays and protons, cause ionization because
of electric forces. That is, when they pass through a material, they can attract or
repel electrons strongly enough to remove them from the atoms of the material.
Since the 
and 
rays emitted by radioactive substances have energies on the
order of 1 MeV (
to 
), whereas ionization of atoms and molecules
requires on the order of 10 eV (Chapter 27), we see that a single 
or 
particle
can cause thousands of ionizations.
Neutral particles also give rise to ionization when they pass through materials.
For example, X-ray and -ray photons can ionize atoms by knocking out electrons
by means of the photoelectric and Compton effects (Chapter 27). Furthermore, if 
a 
ray has sufficient energy (greater than 1.02 MeV), it can undergo pair pro-
duction: an electron and a positron are produce
