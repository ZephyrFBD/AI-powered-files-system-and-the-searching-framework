energy is added to the
car engine when the gasoline combusts.
d.
The energy given to the system for cooking
helps to make food and energy in the car engine
remains conserved when gasoline combustion
takes place.
38. What does it mean for a system to be in a higher level
of entropy? How can it be reduced?
a.
Higher level of entropy refers to higher state of
disorder in the system and it can be reduced by
input of energy to lower the entropy.
b.
Higher level of entropy refers to higher state of
symmetry in the system and it can be reduced by
release of energy to lower the entropy.
c.
Higher level of entropy refers to low disorder in
the system and it can be reduced by input of
energy to increase the entropy.
d.
Higher level of entropy refers to higher state of
disorder in the system and it can be reduced by
providing a catalyst to lower the entropy.
39. When the air temperature drops and rain turns to snow,
