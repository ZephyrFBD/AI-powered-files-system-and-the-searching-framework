(B)
Having a child with red hair is possible if genes on the father’s

(C)
Giving birth to a child with red hair can occur through gene
flow, in which new genes enter a population as a result of
migration.
(D)
6. Which of the following best describes the importance of the
process shown?
The process contributes to genetic diversity by recombining
alleles in new patterns.
(A)
The process contributes to evolution by causing random point
mutations.
(B)
The process contributes to genetic driȇ by preventing
heterozygosity.
(C)
The process contributes to embryonic development by
ensuring that all cells have the same DNA.
(D)
