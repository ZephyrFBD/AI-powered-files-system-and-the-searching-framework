potential of –65mV would not be selected for, because when the cell is hyperpolarized to such a large degree, the
passage says it does not respond to light stimuli anymore. This means that the visual cues will be absent and the trait
won’t be selected for.
b. Explain how the control in Experiment 1 would differ from the control in Experiment 2. (3 points)
The control in Experiment 1 would be the rod cell in the vitreous humor that is not stimulated by light. Experiment 2
would have a similar control except that it would be in vitreous humor devoid of sodium and then without stimulation by
light.
c. Describe the relationship between a stimulus and hyperpolarization. Use evidence from the data. (3 points)
When the stimulus was a low light intensity, it caused a small hyperpolarization shown by the small downward bump
in Figure 2. However, when the stimulus was a high light intensity, the membrane potential dipped very low, all the way to
–65mV. The intensity of the light stimulus a
