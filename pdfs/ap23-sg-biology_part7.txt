(a) 
Describe the role of the inner mitochondrial membrane in cellular respiration. 
Accept one of the following: 
• 
It provides the location for the components of the electron transport chain/ATP 
synthase/oxidative phosphorylation. 
• 
It separates (reactions in) the intermembrane space from (reactions in) the matrix. 
• 
It allows the establishment of a proton gradient.
