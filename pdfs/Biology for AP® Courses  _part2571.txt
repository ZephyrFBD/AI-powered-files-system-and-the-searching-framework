il and this nutrient was
needed and used by the seedlings in the soil. The
Strain 2 bacteria increased the availability of
potassium in the soil.
69. In a hypothetical research situation, scientists discover
bacterial endospores in silt at the bottom of a marsh that
has been contaminated with a pollutant for 25 years. The
silt of the marsh was deposited in annual layers. The age
of the endospores can be estimated, then, by identifying
the layer of silt in which the endospores are found. In flask
A, researchers place 20-year-old endospores along with
growth medium and the pollutant. In flask B, researchers
place 100-year-old endospores along with growth medium
and the pollutant. Which statement describes the results
you would expect to see in the growth of the flasks?
a.
The growth in flask A will exceed that of flask
B.
b.
The growth in flask B will exceed that of flask
A.
c.
The growth each flask will be about equal.
d.
There will be little to no growth in each flask.
