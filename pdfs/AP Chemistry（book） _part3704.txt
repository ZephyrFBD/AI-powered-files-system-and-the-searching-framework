 
coordination number of the Fe and then use the coordination 
number to predict the geometry. We can then either make a series 
of drawings with ligands in different positions to determine the 
number of isomers or deduce the number of isomers by analogy 
to cases we have discussed.
Solve The name indicates that the complex has four carbonyl 
(CO) ligands and two chloro (Cl-) ligands, so its formula is 
Fe(CO)4Cl2. The complex therefore has a coordination num-
ber of 6, and we can assume an octahedral geometry. Like 
3Co(NH3)4Cl24+ (Figure 23.8), it has four ligands of one type 
and two of another. Consequently, there are two isomers possi-
ble: one with the Cl- ligands across the metal from each other, 
trans@3Fe(CO)4Cl24, and one with the Cl- ligands adjacent to each 
other, cis@3Fe(CO)4Cl24.
Comment It is easy to overestimate the number of geometric iso-
mers. Sometimes different orientations of a single isomer are in-
correctly thought to be different isomers. If two structures ca
