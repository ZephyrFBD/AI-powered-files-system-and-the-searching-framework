is an ellipse with the
Sun at one focus (Fig. 5–28).
Kepler’s second law: Each planet moves so that an imaginary line drawn from the
Sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal periods of time (Fig. 5–29).
Kepler’s third law: The ratio of the squares of the periods T of any two planets
revolving around the Sun is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their mean dis-
tances from the Sun. [The mean distance equals the semimajor axis s (
the distance from the planet’s near point N and far point M from the Sun,
Fig. 5–28).] That is, if 
and 
represent the periods (the time needed for 
one revolution about the Sun) for any two planets, and 
and 
represent their
mean distances from the Sun, then
We can rewrite Kepler’s third law as
meaning that 
should be the same for each planet. Present-day data are
given in Table 5–2; see the last column.
In Examples and Problems we usually will assume the orbits are circles,
although it is not quite true in general.
