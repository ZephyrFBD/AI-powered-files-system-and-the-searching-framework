 of the next trophic
level.
d.
As respiration and heat loss uses energy of the
primary producer, therefore, net primary
productivity is what is actually available to
primary consumers.

a.
The process of nitrate formation from ammonia
is called nitrogen fixation. It improves
agricultural production as nitrogen is required by
plants for nucleotide and protein formation.
b.
The process of nitrogen being bonded to organic
molecule is called nitrogen fixation. It improves
the crop yield by allowing the plants to compete
with weeds.
c.
The reduction of nitrates back to nitrogen gas is
called nitrogen fixation. It improves agricultural
production as nitrogen is required by plants for
nucleotide and protein formation.
d.
The process of nitrogen being bonded into
organic molecules is called nitrogen fixation. It
