. (B) and (D) are incorrect
because these actions of ANP would be best described as endocrine. (C) is
incorrect because this action of ANP would be best described as autocrine
(ANP acts on the same cells that produced the peptide).
21. B
(B) is the correct answer as all the factors listed are ways that a food web
can lose energy, and thus not pass the energy to higher trophic levels. (A)
is incorrect because energy at higher levels is not consumed by
autotrophs; autotrophs are primary producers. Any energy consumed by
an autotroph is not a source of loss for the food web, since autotrophs are
the producers in the food web. (C) is incorrect because energy is
produced, not lost, through photosynthesis and chemosynthesis. (D) is
incorrect because the remains of dead organisms are passed to
decomposers, not apex consumers (apex consumers are at the highest
trophic level).
22. D
When additional wild-type protein X is added to normal E. coli cells in
Experiment 1, the level of protein X cont
