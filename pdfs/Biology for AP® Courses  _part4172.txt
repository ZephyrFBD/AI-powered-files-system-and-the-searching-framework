atching, the larval caterpillars emerge and spend four to six weeks feeding solely on wild lupine (Figure 35.4). The
caterpillars pupate (undergo metamorphosis) and emerge as butterflies after about four weeks. The adult butterflies feed
on the nectar of flowers of wild lupine and other plant species. A researcher interested in studying Karner blue butterflies
at the organismal level might, in addition to asking questions about egg laying, ask questions about the butterfliesâ€™
preferred temperature (a physiological question) or the behavior of the caterpillars when they are at different larval stages
(a behavioral question).
