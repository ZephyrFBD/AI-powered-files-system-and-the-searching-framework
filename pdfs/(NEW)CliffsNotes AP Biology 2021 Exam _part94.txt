 through cells (rather than intercellular spaces) to enter
the bloodstream.
Communicating junctions are passageways between cells that allow the transfer of chemical or electrical signals.
Two kinds of communicating junctions occur, as follows:
• Gap junctions are narrow tunnels between animal cells. The proteins that make up these junctions prevent
cytoplasmic proteins and nucleic acids of each cell from mixing, but allow the passage of ions and small molecules.
In this manner, gap junctions allow communication between cells through the exchange of materials or through the
transmission of electrical impulses. Gap junctions are essentially channel proteins of two adjacent cells that are
closely aligned. Because the proteins of each cell extend beyond the plasma membranes before they meet, a small
gap occurs between the two plasma membranes.
• Plasmodesmata (singular, plasmodesma) are narrow channels between plant cells. A narrow tube of endoplasmic
reticulum, surrounded by cytoplasm an
