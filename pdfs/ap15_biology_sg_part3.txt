Question 1 (continued) 
 
(a) The nervous system plays a role in coordinating the observed activity pattern of the mice in 
response to light-dark stimuli. Describe ONE role of each of the following anatomical structures in 
responding to light-dark stimuli. 
• 
A photoreceptor in the retina of the eye 
• 
The brain 
• 
A motor neuron 
 
 
Descriptions (1 point per box; 3 points maximum) 
Photoreceptor 
Detects light/dark stimulus and initiates/transmits signal 
Brain 
Integrates/processes/coordinates information 
Motor neuron 
Transmits signal from brain to an effector 
 
(b) Based on an analysis of the data in F
