 4. In a population of certain frogs in which the  
allele for brown skin is dominant to the allele for 
green skin, a drought leads to selection against 
green-skinned frogs. When the drought ends,  
12 percent of the remaining frogs exhibit the 
green-skin phenotype. If the population is now in 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, what will be the 
frequency of the green-skin allele in the next 
generation? Provide your answer to the nearest 
hundredth.
