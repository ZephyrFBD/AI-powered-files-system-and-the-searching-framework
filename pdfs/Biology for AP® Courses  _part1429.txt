observed several X-linked phenotypes that were associated with a structurally unusual and dissimilar X chromosome pair
in which one X was missing a small terminal segment, and the other X was fused to a piece of the Y chromosome. By
crossing flies, observing their offspring, and then visualizing the offspringâ€™s chromosomes, Stern demonstrated that every
time the offspring allele combination deviated from either of the parental combinations, there was a corresponding exchange
of an X chromosome segment. Using mutant flies with structurally distinct X chromosomes was the key to observing the
products of recombination because DNA sequencing and other molecular tools were not yet available. It is now known that
homologous chromosomes regularly exchange segments in meiosis by reciprocally breakin
