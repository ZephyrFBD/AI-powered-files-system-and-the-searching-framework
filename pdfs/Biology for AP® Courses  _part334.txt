DNA and RNA
Nucleic acids are the most important macromolecules for the continuity of life. They carry the genetic blueprint of a cell
and carry instructions for the functioning of the cell.
The two main types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). DNA is the genetic
material found in all living organisms, ranging from single-celled bacteria to multicellular mammals. It is found in the
nucleus of eukaryotes and in the organelles, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. In prokaryotes, the DNA is not enclosed in a
membranous envelope.
The entire genetic content of a cell is known as its genome, and the study of genomes is genomics. In eukaryotic cells but not
in prokaryotes, DNA forms a complex with histone proteins to form chromatin, the substance of eukaryotic chrom
