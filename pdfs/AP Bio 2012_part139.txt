Practice
1.2: The student can describe representations and models 
of natural or man-made phenomena and systems in  
the domain.
Learning Objective 
2.29: The student can create representations and models 
to describe immune responses.
(A)
This option is correct. The graph correctly represents the humoral immune 
response of an organism to the same antigen more than once. Memory cells 
created after the first exposure result in a more rapid response in subsequent 
exposures with a greater amount of the antibody.
(B)
This option is incorrect. The graph shows that the amount of antibody during 
the first exposure is twice as much as the second exposure, whereas the second 
exposure to the antigen should show results that have a rapid increase in the 
amount of antibody.
(C)
This option is incorrect. The graph shows that during the first antigen exposure 
the antibody increased and remained at a high level, which is not what happens in 
an individualâ€™s humoral response.
(D)
This option is
