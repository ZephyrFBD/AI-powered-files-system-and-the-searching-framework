iophage provides the gene 
coding for the cholera toxin, which converts the 
bacterium to the virulent form that causes cholera. 
Which of the following best explains how the 
gene encoding cholera toxin becomes part of the 
bacterial genome? 
(A) The bacteriophage inserts the toxin gene  
into the host cell DNA, and the gene is 
expressed with the rest of the host cellâ€™s 
genes. 
(B) The bacteriophage makes copies of the toxin 
gene and expresses the copies inside the 
bacteriophage. 
(C) The bacteriophage converts its toxin gene 
into mRNA, which is then translated by the 
host cell. 
(D) The bacteriophage transforms itself into a 
self-replicating protein that can survive 
inside the host cell. 
 
 
 
 
39. A species of snail lives in the intertidal zone along 
the coast of New England. The dark-colored 
variety of the species is more common in northern 
New England, the light-colored variety is more 
common two hundred miles away in southern 
New England, and both varieties are com
