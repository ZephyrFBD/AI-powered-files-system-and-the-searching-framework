rcuits and Reactance
613
Capacitor reactance. What is the rms current in the circuit
of Fig. 21–41a if
and 
Calculate for (a)
and then for (b)
APPROACH We find the reactance using Eq. 21–12b, and solve for current in
the equivalent form of Ohm’s law, Eq. 21–12a.
SOLUTION (a)
The rms current is (Eq. 21–12a):
(b) For
will be 
and
vastly larger!
NOTE The dependence on f is dramatic. For high frequencies, the capacitive
reactance is very small.
Two common applications of capacitors are illustrated in Figs.21–42a and b. In
Fig. 21–42a, circuit A is said to be capacitively coupled to circuit B. The purpose of
the capacitor is to prevent a dc voltage from passing from A to B but allowing an
ac signal to pass relatively unimpeded (if C is sufficiently large). In Fig. 21–42b, the
