Populations of species share a gene pool: a collection of all the variants of genes in the species. Again, the basis to
any changes in a group or population of organisms must be genetic for this is the only way to share and pass on traits.
When variations occur within a species, they can only be passed to the next generation along two main pathways: asexual
reproduction or sexual reproduction. The change will be passed on asexually simply if the reproducing cell possesses
the changed trait. For the changed trait to be passed on by sexual reproduction, a gamete, such as a sperm or egg cell,
must possess the changed trait. In other words, sexually-reproducing organisms can experience several genetic changes
in their body cells, but if these changes do not occur in a sperm or egg cell, the changed trait will never reach the next
generation. Only heritable traits can evolve. Therefore
