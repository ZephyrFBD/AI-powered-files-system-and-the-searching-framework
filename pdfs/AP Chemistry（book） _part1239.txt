Step 2 involves the formation of sodium ion from solid sodium, 
which is just the heat of formation for sodium gas and the first ion-
ization energy for sodium (Appendix C and Figure 7.10 list numbers 
for these processes):
Na1s2 ¡ Na1g2 
∆H = ∆Hf°3Na1g24 = 108 kJ 
[8.6]
Na1g2 ¡ Na+1g2+ e -  
∆H = I11Na2 = 496 kJ 
[8.7]
The sum of these two processes gives us the required energy for 
Step 2 (above), which is 604 kJ.
Similarly, for Step 3, we have to create chlorine atoms, and then 
anions, from the Cl2 molecule, in two steps. The enthalpy changes 
for these two steps are the sum of the enthalpy of formation of Cl(g) 
and the electron affinity of chlorine, EA(Cl):
1
2 Cl21g2 ¡ Cl1g2 
∆H = ∆Hf°3Cl1g24 = 122 kJ 
[8.8]
e- + Cl1g2 ¡ Cl-1g2 
∆H = EA1Cl2 = -349 kJ 
[8.9]
The sum of these two processes gives us the required energy for Step 3 
(above), which is -227 kJ.
Finally, when we put it all together, we have:

2 Cl21g2
