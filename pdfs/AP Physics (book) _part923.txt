they are not needed. When using a torque equation, a torque that tends to rotate
the object counterclockwise is usually considered positive, whereas a torque that
tends to rotate it clockwise is considered negative. (But the opposite convention
would be OK too.)
One of the forces that acts on objects is the force of gravity. As we discussed
in Section 7–8, we can consider the force of gravity on an object as acting at its
center of gravity (CG) or center of mass (CM), which for practical purposes are the
same point. For uniform symmetrically shaped objects, the CG is at the geometric
center. For more complicated objects, the CG can be determined as discussed 
in Section 7–8.
