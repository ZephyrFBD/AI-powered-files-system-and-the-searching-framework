About Guessing
Many candidates wonder whether or not to guess the answers to questions about which they are not certain.
Multiple-choice scores are based on the number of questions answered correctly. Points are not deducted for
incorrect answers, and no points are awarded for unanswered questions. Because points are not deducted for
incorrect answers, you are encouraged to answer all multiple-choice questions. On any questions you do not know
the answer to, you should eliminate as many choices as you can, and then select the best answer among the
remaining choices.
