 within and between cells, organisms, and populations. These 
behaviors are directed by underlying genetic information, and responses to 
information are vital to natural selection and evolution. Genetic information 
is a repository of instructions necessary for the survival, growth, and 
reproduction of the organism. Genetic variation can be advantageous for 
the long-term survival and evolution of a species. 
BIG IDEA 4: SYSTEMS INTERACTIONS (SYI)
Biological systems interact, and these systems and their interactions 
exhibit complex properties. All biological systems comprise parts that 
interact with one another. These interactions result in characteristics and 
emergent properties not found in the individual parts alone. All biological 
systems from the molecular level to the ecosystem level exhibit properties 
of biocomplexity and diversity. These two properties provide robustness to 
biological systems, enabling greater resiliency and flexibility to tolerate and 
respond to chang
