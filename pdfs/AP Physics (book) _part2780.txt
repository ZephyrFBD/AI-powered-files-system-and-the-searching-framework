P each of red and blue). There are
more green pixels because they are most important in our eyes’ ability to note resolution. So the
distance between green pixels is a rough guide to the sharpness of a Bayer. To match a
Foveon (36 MP, or 12 MP of tri-pixel sites), a Bayer would need to have about 24 MP (because it
would then have 12 MP of green). This “equivalence” is only a rough approximation.

Blown-up photograph. A photograph looks sharp 
at normal viewing distances if the dots or lines are resolved to perhaps
Would an 
enlargement of a photo taken by the camera
in Example 25–3 seem sharp?
APPROACH We assume the image is 
on a
sensor as in Example 25–3, or 
We make an enlarged photo
SOLUTION The short side of the sensor is 
long, and that side
of the photograph is 8 inches or 20 cm. Thus the size is increased by a factor of
To fill the

assume the enlargement is 
The pixels are thus enlarged 
So the pixel
