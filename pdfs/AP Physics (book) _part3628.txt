Theoreticians have wondered why the W and Z have large masses rather
than being massless like the photon. Peter Higgs and others in 1964 used elec-
troweak theory to suggest an explanation by means of a Higgs field and its
particle, the Higgs boson, which interact with the W and Z to “slow them down.”
In being forced to go slower than the speed of light, they would have to have
mass 
only if 
Indeed, the Higgs field is thought to permeate the
vacuum (“empty space”) and to perhaps confer mass on particles that now have
mass by slowing them down. In 2012 strong evidence was announced at CERN’s
Large Hadron Collider (Section 32–1) for a particle of mass 
that is
thought to be the long-sought Higgs boson of the Standard Model. But intense
research continues, not only to better unders
