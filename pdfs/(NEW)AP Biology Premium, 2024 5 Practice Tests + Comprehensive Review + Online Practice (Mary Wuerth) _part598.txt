are exposed to a heat shock for too long, the cells may lyse, and no transformed bacteria will
result. If the amount of time of the heat shock is too short, the plasmids may not be able to enter the bacteria cells.
So it is important to have appropriate controls for this investigation so that one can ascertain which bacteria were
successfully transformed and to confirm that the heat shock procedure did not kill the bacteria. The following table
and Figure 24.9 show the components of a typical bacterial transformation experiment (that used a plasmid that
contains a gene for ampicillin resistance) and the expected results.
Figure 24.9 Expected Results
Test tube A does not contain the plasmid. Its contents are grown on LB agar, upon which both bacteria with or
without the plasmid will grow, so it is expected that there will be robust growth of bacteria on this plate.
Test tube B does not contain the plasmid. Its contents are grown on LB agar to which ampicillin has been
added. Ampicillin
