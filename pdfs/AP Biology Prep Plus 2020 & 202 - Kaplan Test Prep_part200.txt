bovine spongiform
encephalopathy), and they are connected with diseases that are typically
slow to form, taking years before symptoms develop. Despite once being
called slow viruses, prions are not viruses at all and do not contain any
DNA or RNA. Recent evidence suggests that prions are infectious because
they change the structure of an organism’s normal proteins, a switch not
encoded in genes at all, by coming into contact with the proteins. They
are not recognized by the immune system, probably because their
structure is similar  to the structure of normal proteins. Perhaps the most
fascinating implication of studying prions is that their existence shows
that more than one tertiary protein structure may form from the same
primary structure. Both prions and the normal proteins from which
prions derive have identical amino acid sequences, and no traceable DNA
mutation has yet been discovered that could lead to the formation of
prion particles.
