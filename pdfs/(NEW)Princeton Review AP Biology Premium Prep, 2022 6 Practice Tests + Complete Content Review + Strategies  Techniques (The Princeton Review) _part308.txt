are
provided by the ovule and are maternally inherited. Chloroplasts also contain DNA, in the form of one circular
double-stranded molecule. Both chloroplasts and mitochondria assort randomly into daughter cells and gametes.
Pedigrees
One way to study genetic inheritance is by looking at a special family tree called a pedigree. A pedigree shows
which family members have a particular trait and it can help determine if a trait is recessive or dominant and if it is
sex-linked. Traits that skip generations are usually recessive. Traits that appear more in one sex than the other are
usually sex-linked. In a pedigree chart, the males are squares and the females are circles. Matings are drawn with
horizontal lines and the offspring are shown below the mated couple.
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON TRAITS
Changes in genotypes can result in changes in phenotype, but environmental factors also influence many traits, both
directly and indirectly. In addition, an organismâ€™s adaptation to the local environ
