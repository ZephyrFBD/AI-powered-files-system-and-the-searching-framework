1–7 Order of Magnitude:
Rapid Estimating
We are sometimes interested only in an approximate value for a quantity. This
might be because an accurate calculation would take more time than it is worth
or would require additional data that are not available. In other cases, we may
want to make a rough estimate in order to check a calculation made on a calcu-
lator, to make sure that no blunders were made when the numbers were entered.
A rough estimate can be made by rounding off all numbers to one significant
figure and its power of 10, and after the calculation is made, again keeping only
one significant figure. Such an estimate is called an order-of-magnitude estimate
and can be accurate within a factor of 10, and often better. In fact, the phrase
“order of magnitude” is sometimes used to refer simply to the power of 10.
Let’s do some Examples.
