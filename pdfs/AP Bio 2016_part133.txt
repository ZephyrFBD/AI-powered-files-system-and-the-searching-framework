  Neuromodulin is an essential protein that is highly conserved among vertebrates. Researchers 
compared the first 60 amino acids of the neuromodulin protein from each of five different species. The 
results are shown in the table above. 
  Based on the data in the table, construct a cladogram on the template provided to represent the 
evolutionary relatedness of the five species. Using the data, justify the placement of the zebra fish on 
the cladogram. On the cladogram, circle the position of the most recent common ancestor of the two 
most closely related species. (3 points)
