Sonar generally makes use of ultrasonic frequencies: that is, sound waves whose
frequencies are above 20 kHz, beyond the range of human detection. For sonar,
the frequencies are typically in the range 20 kHz to 100 kHz. One reason for using
ultrasound waves, other than the fact that they are inaudible, is that for shorter
wavelengths there is less diffraction (Section 11–14) so the beam spreads less and
smaller objects can be detected.

on the strength of the echo. A two-dimensional image can then be formed out of
these dots from a series of scans. The transducer is moved, or an array of trans-
ducers is used, each of which sends out a pulse at each position and receives echoes
as shown in Fig. 12–28a. Each trace can be plotted, spaced ap
