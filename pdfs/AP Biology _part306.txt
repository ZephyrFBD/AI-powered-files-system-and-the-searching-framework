ack individuals. With the results of the first mating, it is most
likely that black guinea pig #1 is homozygous dominant. If it had
been hybrid, there probably would have been at least one white
offspring. The fact that there are several white offspring from the
second mating indicates that the second black male, #3, is hybrid for
certain. (IST-1)
(D) A testcross is carried out on an organism that shows the dominant
trait to determine if it is homozygous dominant or hybrid (BB or
Bb). You cross the organism in question with an organism that
shows the recessive trait (bb). For example, if white fur is a
recessive trait (b), and an organism has white fur, you know the
organismâ€™s genotype by looking at it (bb). Below are the Punnett
squares and results from a testcross:
If the parent with the unknown genotype is homozygous dominant
(BB), there will never be any offspring that show the recessive trait
in a testcross (see Punnett Square A). However, if the parent with
the unknown genotype i
