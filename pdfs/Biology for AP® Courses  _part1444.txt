. This underscores the importance of “gene dosage” in humans. Most autosomal trisomies also fail
to develop to birth; however, duplications of some of the smaller chromosomes (13, 15, 18, 21, or 22) can result in offspring
that survive for several weeks to many years. Trisomic individuals suffer from a different type of genetic imbalance: an
excess in gene dose. Individuals with an extra chromosome may synthesize an abundance of the gene products encoded
by that chromosome. This extra dose (150 percent) of specific genes can lead to a number of functional challenges and
often precludes development. The most common trisomy among viable births is that of chromosome 21, which corresponds
to Down Syndrome. Individuals with this inherited disorder are characterized by short stature and stunted digits, facial
distinctions that include a broad skull and large tongue, and significant developmental delays. The incidence of Down
syndrome is correlated with maternal age; older women are more like
