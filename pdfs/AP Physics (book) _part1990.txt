ave to be turned off to get this circuit below 20 A. (Houses
and apartments usually have several circuits, each with its own fuse or circuit
breaker; try moving one of the devices to another circuit.) If the circuit is designed
with heavier wire and a 30-A fuse, the fuse shouldn’t blow—if it does, a short may be
the problem. (The most likely place for a short is in the cord of one of the devices.)
Proper fuse size is selected according to the wire used to supply the current. A prop-
erly rated fuse should never be replaced by a higher-rated one, even in a car.
A fuse blowing or a circuit breaker opening is acting like a switch, making an
“open circuit.” By an open circuit, we mean that there is no longer a complete
conducting path, so no current can flow; it is as if R = q.
Will a fuse blow? Determine the total current drawn by
all the devices in the circuit of Fig. 18–20.
APPROACH Each device has the same 120-V voltage across it. The current each
draws from the source is found from
