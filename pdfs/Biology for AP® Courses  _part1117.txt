o a 30-nm chromatin fiber. When a cell undergoes mitosis, the
chromosomes condense even further.
DNA replicates in the S phase of interphase. After replication, the chromosomes are composed of two linked sister
chromatids. When fully compact, the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins.
The connection between the sister chromatids is closest in a region called the centromere. The conjoined sister chromatids,
with a diameter of about 1 Âµm, are visible under a light microscope. The centromeric region is highly condensed and thus
will appear as a constricted area.

This animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Packaged_DNA) illustrates the different levels of chromosome packing.
Why is nucleosome formation required for the packaging of DNA?
a.
Nucleosome formation results in compaction of the DNA to form chromatin.
b.
Nucleosome formation results in DNA synthesis.
c.
Nucleosome formation decreases the number of i
