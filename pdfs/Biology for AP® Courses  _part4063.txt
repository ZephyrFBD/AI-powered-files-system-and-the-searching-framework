n, the uterus and vaginal muscles contract in waves that may last slightly less than a
second each. During phase four, or resolution, the processes described in the first three phases reverse themselves and return
to their normal state. Men experience a refractory period in which they cannot maintain an erection or ejaculate for a period
of time ranging from minutes to hours.
Gametogenesis (Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis)
Gametogenesis, the production of sperm and eggs, takes place through the process of meiosis. During meiosis, two cell
divisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that were made during an earlier
stage of the cellâ€™s life cycle. Meiosis produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid
cells. The production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis.
Spermatogenesis
