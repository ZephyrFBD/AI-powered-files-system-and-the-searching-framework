ght (not shown), thus making
north and south poles of the plates attached at either end. These end plates are made with triangular fingers that are bent 
over the coil—hence there are alternating N and S poles quite close to one another, with magnetic field lines between 
them as shown by the blue lines. As the rotor turns, these field lines pass through the fixed stator coils (shown on the 
right for clarity, but in operation the rotor rotates within the stator), inducing a current in them, which is the output.

nating (see Fig.21–18 and Section 18–7). Since

we can write
