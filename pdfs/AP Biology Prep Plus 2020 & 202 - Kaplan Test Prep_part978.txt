(d)Â The tetrazolium test is an alternative test for seed viability, in which
seeds are incubated in tetrazolium, rinsed, and then evaluated for
color. In the presence of hydrogen ions, tetrazolium is reduced from a
colorless compound to a red compound. Predict the color of non-
germinating and germinating corn seeds. Justify your response. (2

Here is one possible response that would earn full credit:
Germinating seeds will be red because they have a higher rate of cellular
respiration than non-germinating seeds, which will be white. At a higher
rate of cellular respiration, the germinating seeds produce more hydrogen
ions, which will reduce tetrazolium to a red compound, and thus turn the
seeds red. Non-germinatin
