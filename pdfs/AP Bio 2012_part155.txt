en from being taken from the blood.
(B)
This option is incorrect. The fact that myoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen 
retards anaerobic respiration in the muscles.
(C)
This option is incorrect. The increased availability of oxygen allows the use of 
glucose for energy following breakdown of glycogen by other pathways.
(D)
This option is correct. Because myoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen 
than hemoglobin, it takes oxygen from the blood into the muscles. This 
answer reflects the claim that the student can analyze the data to identify how 
molecular interactions (hemoglobin and myoglobin with O2) affect function 
(binding of O2).
