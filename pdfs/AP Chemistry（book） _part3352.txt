Because the electron is consumed rather than formed in the process, it is shown on the 
reactant side of the equation. Electron capture, like positron emission, has the effect of 
converting a proton to a neutron:

Table 21.2 summarizes the symbols used to represent the particles commonly 
encountered in nuclear reactions. The various types of radioactive decay are summarized 
in Table 21.3.
