(c) An AP Biofeast! 
None of those titles is especially useful or informative because none of them tells what 
the graph is all about. Now look at these two titles: 
(d) Anticipated Consumption of Slices of Pizza at the AP Biology Party, March 9 
(e) Anticipated Consumption of Slices of Pizza at the AP Biology Party, March 9, 
2011, 7:00 p.m.â€“11:00 p.m. 
You should be able to see that only title (e) is helpful and useful. It enables you to tell, by
