water and old agarose, old agar, or even unflavored 
gelatin (use three times the normal amount of gelatin called for on the package for a 
given volume of water). Put the comb in as usual, allow the gel to solidify, and then 
pull the comb out. Cover the gel with water and store refrigerated. These practice gels 
keep for a week and can be loaded and reloaded repeatedly by students; just use a 
plastic pipette and blow the practice samples out of the wells. 
â€¢  Practice samples: Mix 10 drops of glycerol or corn syrup with 50 drops of water and 
one drop of blue food coloring. The final concentration of water may need to be more 
or less, depending on the density of the other liquids, so try pipetting the samples 
with your instruments. 
Students should carefully read through the procedures before conducting the  
investigation, especially if this is the first time they have run an electrophoresis gel.  
Despite the claim that they carefully loaded their samples into the wells of the g
