uch complex assemblies of metal ions 
surrounded by molecules and ions. Metal compounds of this 
kind are called coordination compounds, and the branch of chem-
istry that focuses on them is called coordination chemistry.
23.1 ∣ The Transition Metals
The part of the periodic table in which the d orbitals are being 
filled as we move left to right across a row is the home of the 
transition metals (Figure 23.2). 
 (Section 6.8)
With some exceptions (e.g., platinum, gold), metallic ele-
ments are found in nature as solid inorganic compounds called 
minerals. Notice from Table 23.1 that minerals are identified 
by common names rather than chemical names.

▲ Figure 23.1 Hemocyanine binds oxygen. The Cu+ ions are each 
bound by three nitrogen atoms from the hemocyanine protein in the 
deoxygenated state (left). As the O2 molecule binds between the Cu+ 
ions, it is reduced to O2
