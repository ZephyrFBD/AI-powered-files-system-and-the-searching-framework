▶Practice Exercise 1
What is the density of methane, CH4, in a vessel where the 
pressure is 910 torr and the temperature is 255 K?  
(a) 0.92 g/L (b) 697 g/L (c) 0.057 g/L (d) 16 g/L  
(e) 0.72 g/L
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
The mean molar mass of the atmosphere at the surface of 
Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, is 28.6 g>mol. The surface tem-
perature is 95 K, and the pressure is 1.6 atm. Assuming ideal 
behavior, calculate the density of Titan’s atmosphere.

Calculating Gas Density
mixtures, a less dense gas will lie above a denser gas in the absence of mixing. For exam-
ple, CO2 has a higher molar mass than N2 or O2 and is therefore denser than air. For this 
reason, CO2 released from a CO2 fire extinguisher blankets a fire, preventing O2 from 
reaching the combustible material. “Dry ice,” which is solid CO2, converts directly to 
CO2 gas at room temperature, and the resulting “fog” (which is actually condensed 
water droplets cooled by the CO
