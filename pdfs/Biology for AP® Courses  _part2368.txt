Plant viruses can seriously disrupt crop growth and development, significantly affecting our food supply. They are
responsible for poor crop quality and quantity globally, and can bring about huge economic losses annually. Others viruses
may damage plants used in landscaping. Some viruses that infect agricultural food plants include the name of the plant
they infect, such as tomato spotted wilt virus, bean common mosaic virus, and cucumber mosaic virus. In plants used for
landscaping, two of the most common viruses are peony ring spot and rose mosaic virus. There are far too many plant
viruses to discuss each in detail, but symptoms of bean common mosaic virus result in lowered bean production and stunted,
unproductive plants. In the ornamental rose, the rose mosaic disease causes wavy yellow lines and colored splotches on the
leaves of the plant.
