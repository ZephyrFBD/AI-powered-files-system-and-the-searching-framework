dit:
The optimum pH is not the same for each enzyme because the structure
and function of enzymes depend on the amino acids in the chain, and these
amino acids have functional groups that are influenced by pH. When pH
changes, the charges on the amino acids may change due to the available
H+ and OH– ions. Thus, the 3-D shape and function of the protein may be
altered.
The optimum pH of pepsin, which occurs at maximum activity, is approximately 2 
The structure (and in turn function) of enzymes depends on the charges of the amino
acids, which are influenced by pH
(c) Based on the data, predict the optimum pH of chymotrypsin, which
has a working pH range of 5.2 to 9.8. (1 point)
Prediction (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Optimum pH occurs at the maximum enzyme activity, which is typically the
midpoint of the working pH range. Since the working pH range of
chymotrypsin is from 5.2 to 9.8, the optimum pH of chymotrypsin would
be the average, or 7.5.
