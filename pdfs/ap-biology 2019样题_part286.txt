 
to solve problems, analyze experimental data, describe 
natural phenomena, make predictions, and describe 
processes symbolically. Students should also justify the 
selection of a particular mathematical routine and apply 
the routine to describe natural phenomena. 
Students should also be able to analyze data collected 
from an experimental procedure or from a given source 
to determine whether the data support or do not 
support a conclusion or hypothesis. For example, if a 
student conducts an experiment to determine if light 
intensity affects the rate of photosynthesis, he or she 
can construct a graph based on the collected data and 
use the graph to formulate statements, conclusions, 
and possibly a hypothesis. Alternatively, students
