Human body cells have 46 chromosomes,
while human gametes (sperm or eggs) have 23 chromosomes each. A typical body cell, or somatic cell, contains two
matched sets of chromosomes, a configuration known as diploid. The letter n is used to represent a single set of
chromosomes; therefore, a diploid organism is designated 2n. Human cells that contain one set of chromosomes are called
gametes, or sex cells; these are eggs and sperm, and are designated 1n, or haploid.
Figure 10.3 There are 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes in a female human somatic cell. The condensed
chromosomes are viewed within the nucleus (top), removed from a cell in mitosis and spread out on a slide (right),
and artificially arranged according to length (left); an arrangement like this is called a karyotype. In this image,
the chromosomes were exposed to fluorescent stains for differentiation of the different chromosomes. A method of
staining called “chromosome painting” employs fluorescent dyes that highlight chromo
