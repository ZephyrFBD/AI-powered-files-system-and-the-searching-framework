erything we hear is inside the brain along with everything we see,
feel, smell and taste. Words and language are waveform ﬁelds
generated by our vocal chords which pass through this process until
they are decoded by the brain into words that we hear. Diﬀerent
languages are diﬀerent frequency ﬁelds or sound waves generated

That’s exactly what they are and scientist Robert Lanza describes in
his book, Biocentrism, how we decode electromagnetic waves and
energy into visual and ‘physical’ experience. He uses the example of
a ﬂame emiĴing photons, electromagnetic energy, each pulsing
