han the other fish; therefore, they would breed together as well. Offspring of these fish would likely
behave as their parents: feeding and living in the same area and keeping separate from the original population. If this group
of fish continued to remain separate from the first population, eventually sympatric speciation might occur as more genetic
differences accumulated between them.
This scenario does play out in nature, as do others that lead to reproductive isolation. One such place is Lake Victoria in
Africa, famous for its sympatric speciation of cichlid fish. Researchers have found hundreds of sympatric speciation events
in these fish, which have not only happened in great number, but also over a short period of time. Figure 18.23 shows
this type of speciation among a cichlid fish population in Nicaragua. In this locale, two types of cichlids live in the same
geographic location but have come to have different morphologies that allow them to eat various food sources.
