 Bernoulli effect, by 
setting the sails at an angle, as shown in Fig. 10–26. The air traveling rapidly over 
the bulging front surface of the mainsail exerts a smaller pressure than the relatively
still air behind the sail. The result is a net force on the sail,
as shown in 
Fig. 10–26b. This force would tend to make the boat move sideways if it weren’t
for the keel that extends vertically downward beneath the water: the water exerts
a force 
on the keel nearly perpendicular to the keel. The resultant of
these two forces 
is almost directly forward as shown.
