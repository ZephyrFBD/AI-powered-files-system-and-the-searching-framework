plant uses electrical energy to decompose aque-
ous solutions of NaCl to give Cl2, H2, and NaOH:
 
 2 NaCl1aq2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡ 2 NaOH1aq2 + H21g2 + Cl21g2
 
 If the plant produces 1.5 * 106 kg (1500 metric tons) of Cl2 
daily, estimate the quantities of H2 and NaOH produced.
 3.101 The fat stored in a camel’s hump is a source of both energy and 
water. Calculate the mass of H2O produced by the metabolism 
of 1.0 kg of fat, assuming the fat consists entirely of tristearin 
1C57H110O62, a typical animal fat, and assuming that during me-
tabolism, tristearin reacts with O2 to form only CO2 and H2O.
 3.102 When hydrocarbons are burned in a limited amount of air, both 
CO and CO2 form. When 0.450 g of a particular hydrocarbon was 
burned in air, 0.467 g of CO, 0.733 g of CO2, and 0.450 g of H2O 
were formed. (a) What is the empirical formula of the compound? 
(b) How many grams of O2 were used in the reaction? (c) How 
many grams would have been required for complete combustion?
