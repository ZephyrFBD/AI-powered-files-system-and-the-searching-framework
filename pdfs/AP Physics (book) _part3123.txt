 the slits one at a time. So the interference pattern could not arise
from the interaction of one electron with another. It is as if an electron passed
through both slits at the same time, interfering with itself. This is possible because
an electron is not precisely a particle. It is as much a wave as it is a particle, and 
a wave could travel through both slits at once. But what would happen if we 
covered one of the slits so we knew that the electron passed through the other slit,
and a little later we covered the second slit so the electron had to have passed
through the first slit? The result would be that no interference pattern would be
seen. We would see, instead, two bright areas (or diffraction patterns) on the
screen behind the slits.
If both slits are open, the screen shows an interference pattern as if each
electron passed through both slits, like a wave. Yet each electron would make a
tiny spot on the screen as if it were a particle.
The main point of this discussion is t
