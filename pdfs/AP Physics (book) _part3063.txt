Thus we see that the Balmer series of lines corresponds to
transitions or “jumps” that bring the electron down to the second energy level.
Similarly,
corresponds to the Lyman series and 
to the Paschen
series (see Fig. 27–29).
When the constant in Eq. 27–16 is evaluated with 
it is found to have
the measured value of the Rydberg constant,
in Eq. 27–9,
in accord with experiment (see Problem 54).

The great success of Bohr’s model is that it gives an explanation for why atoms
emit line spectra, and accurately predicts the wavelengths of emitted light for
hydrogen. The Bohr model also explains absorption spectra: photons of just the
right wavelength can knock an electron from one energy level to a higher one. To
conserve energy, only photons that have just the right energy will be absorbed. This
explains why a continuous spectrum
