protons is reversed. (B) is incorrect because the
locations of the stroma and thylakoid lumen are switched. (D) is
incorrect because ATP and NADPH are being expended instead of
produced.
2. A
Learning Objective: 13.2
The concentration of NADPH increases in the chloroplast when the
plant cell is not producing suﬀicient ATP to meet cell energy demands.
In cyclic photophosphorylation, electrons move from the reaction
center in photosystem I (P700), through an electron transport chain,
and then back to the same reaction center to produce ATP. This
process does not produce oxygen or NADPH. Thus, shiȇing from
noncyclic photophosphorylation to cyclic photophosphorylation will
only increase ATP levels. ATP is then used in the Calvin cycle to make
sugars to meet cell energy demands. Therefore, the correct answer is
(A). (B) is incorrect because the opposite is true: ATP levels will
increase and oxygen is not produced. (C) is incorrect because
carbohydrates are synthesized in the Calvin cycle. (
