SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the volume 1250 mL2, pressure 11.3 atm2, 
and temperature 131 °C2 of a sample of CO2 gas and asked to cal-
culate the number of moles of CO2 in the sample.
Plan Because we are given V, P, and T, we can solve the ideal-gas 
equation for the unknown quantity, n.
Solve In analyzing and solving gas law problems, it is helpful 
to tabulate the information given in the problems and then to 
convert the values to units that are consistent with those for 
R 10.08206 L@atm/mol@K2. In this case, the given values are
 
 V = 250 mL = 0.250 L
 
 P = 1.3 atm 
 
 T = 31 °C = 131 + 2732 K = 304 K 
Remember: Absolute temperature must always be used when the  
ideal-gas equation is solved.
We now rearrange the ideal-gas equation (Equation 10.5) to solve for n
 n = PV

10.08206 L@atm>mol@K21304 K2
= 0.013 mol CO2
Check Appropriate units cancel, thus ensuring that we have 
properly rearranged the ideal-gas equation and have converted 
to
