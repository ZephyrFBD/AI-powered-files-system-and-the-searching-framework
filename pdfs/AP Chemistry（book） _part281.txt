Atomic number (number
of protons or electrons)
Because all atoms of a given element have the same atomic number, the subscript is redun-
dant and is often omitted. Thus, the symbol for carbon-12 can be represented simply as 12C.
Atoms with identical atomic numbers but different mass numbers (that is, the 
same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons) are called isotopes of one 
another. Several isotopes of carbon are listed in Table 2.2. We will generally use the nota-
tion with superscripts only when referring to a particular isotope of an element. It is 
important to keep in mind that the isotopes of any given element are all alike chemically. 
A carbon dioxide molecule that contains a 13C atom behaves for all practical purposes 
identically to one that contains a 12C atom.
