very point along the axon instead of at specific points. Nodes of Ranvier also save energy for the neuron
since the channels only need to be present at the nodes and not along the entire axon.

Figure 26.13 Nodes of Ranvier are gaps in myelin coverage along axons. Nodes contain voltage-gated K+ and Na+
channels. Action potentials travel down the axon by jumping from one node to the next.
Synaptic Transmission
The synapse or “gap” is the place where information is transmitted from one neuron to another. Synapses usually form
between axon terminals and dendritic spines, but this is not universally true. There are also axon-to-axon, dendrite-to-
dendrite, and axon-to-cell body synapses. The neuron transmitting the signal is called the presynaptic neuron, and the
neuron receiving the signal is called the postsynaptic neuron. Note that these designations are relative to a part
