ll not compensate for the extra order 
of 245 Cal fries. (More than 59 Cal will be required to climb the stairs 
because some energy is used to move limbs and some will be lost as 
heat.) 5.120 (a) 1.479 * 10-18 J > molecule (b) 1 * 10-15 J > photon. 
The X-ray has approximately 1000 times more energy than is produced 
by the combustion of 1 molecule of CH41g2. 5.122 (a) ∆H° for neutral-
ization of the acids is: HNO3, -55.8 kJ; HCl, -56.1 kJ; NH4
+, -4.1 kJ.  
(b) H+1aq2 + OH-1aq2 ¡  H2O1l2 is the net ionic equation for the 
ﬁrst two reactions. NH4
+1aq2 + OH-1aq2 ¡ NH31aq2 + H2O1l2  
(c) The ∆H° values for the ﬁrst two reactions are nearly identical, 
-55.8 kJ and -56.1 kJ. Because spectator ions do not change during 
a reaction and these two reactions have the same net ionic equation, 
it is not surprising that they have the same ∆H°. (d) Strong acids are 
more likely than weak acids to donate H+. Neutralization of the two 
strong acids is energetically favorable, while the third rea
