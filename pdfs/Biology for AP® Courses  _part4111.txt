Hormonal methods use synthetic progesterone (sometimes in combination with estrogen), to inhibit the hypothalamus from
releasing FSH or LH, and thus prevent an egg from being available for fertilization. The method of administering the
hormone affects failure rate. The most reliable method, with a failure rate of less than 1 percent, is the implantation of the
hormone under the skin. The same rate can be achieved through the sterilization procedures of vasectomy in the man or of
tubal ligation in the woman, or by using an intrauterine device (IUD). IUDs are inserted into the uterus and establish an
inflammatory condition that prevents fertilized eggs from implanting into the uterine wall.
