Squamous Epithelia
Squamous epithelial cells are generally round, flat, and have a small, centrally located nucleus. The cell outline is slightly
irregular, and cells fit together to form a covering or lining. When the cells are arranged in a single layer (simple epithelia),
they facilitate diffusion in tissues, such as the areas of gas exchange in the lungs and the exchange of nutrients and waste at
blood capillaries.
