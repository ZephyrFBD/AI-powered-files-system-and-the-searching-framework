e of simply gaining knowledge, or does scientific knowledge only have worth if we
can apply it to solving a specific problem or to bettering our lives? This question focuses on the differences between two
types of science: basic science and applied science.
Basic science or “pure” science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short-term application of that knowledge.
It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value. The immediate goal of
basic science is knowledge for knowledge’s sake, though this does not mean that, in the end, it may not result in a practical
application.
In contrast, applied science or “technology,” aims to use science to solve real-world problems, making it possible, for
example, to improve a crop yield, find a cure for a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural disaster (Figure
1.8). In applied science, the problem is usually defined for the researcher.
