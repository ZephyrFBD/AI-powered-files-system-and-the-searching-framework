ce Ga, which element(s) would you 
pick?
 12.74  If you want to dope GaAs to make a p-type semiconductor 
with an element to replace As, which element(s) would you 
pick?
 12.75  Silicon has a band gap of 1.1 eV at room temperature. 
 
(a) What wavelength of light would a photon of this energy 
correspond to? (b) Draw a vertical line at this wavelength in 
the figure shown, which shows the light output of the Sun 
as a function of wavelength. Does silicon absorb all, none, 
or a portion of the visible light that comes from the Sun? 
(c) You can estimate the portion of the overall solar spec-
trum that silicon absorbs by considering the area under the 
curve. If you call the area under the entire curve “100%,” 
what approximate percentage of the area under the curve is 
absorbed by silicon?
Rutile
Fluorite
 12.65  The coordination number for Mg2 +  ion is usually six. As-
suming this assumption holds, determine the anion coor-
dination number in the following compounds: (a) MgS, (b) 
Mg
