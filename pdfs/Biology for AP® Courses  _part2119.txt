respectively, while the non-resistance allele decreased to 5.6%. This indicates that microevolution was occurring.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
