Active transport mechanisms require the use of the cell’s energy, usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). If
a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient—that is, if the concentration of the substance inside
the cell is greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid (and vice versa)—the cell must use energy to move the
substance. Some active transport mechanisms move small-molecular weight materials, such as ions, through the membrane.
Other mechanisms transport much larger molecules.
Electrochemical Gradient
We have discussed simple concentration gradients—differential concentrations of a substance across a space or a
membrane—but in living systems, gradients are more complex. Because ions move into and out of cells and because
cells contain proteins that do not move across the membrane and are mostly negatively charged, there is also an
