ry network. Water is also reabsorbed during this step. Then, additional solutes and
wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion, which is, in essence, the opposite process to tubular
reabsorption. The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae. From here,
the papillae deliver the filtrate, now called urine, into the minor calyces that eventually connect to the ureters through the
renal pelvis. This entire process is illustrated in Figure 32.8.

Figure 32.8 Each part of the nephron performs a different function in filtering waste and maintaining homeostatic
balance. (1) The glomerulus forces small solutes out of the blood by pressure. (2) The proximal convoluted tubule
reabsorbs ions, water, and nutrients from the filtrate into the interstitial fluid, and actively transports toxins and drugs
from the interstitial fluid into the filtrate. The proximal convoluted t
