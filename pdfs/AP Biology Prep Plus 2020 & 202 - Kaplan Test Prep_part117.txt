and (C) provide examples of the third requirement.

(C) provides evidence that the earliest forms of life lived in water under
extreme conditions of heat. This supports the deep sea vents model,
which maintains that the extreme temperatures found at vents in the
sea created the organic molecules that were the precursors to life. (A)
and (B) are both incorrect because they provide evidence that is
irrelevant to the question; photosynthetic organelles and evidence
that a particular fish species was once found in several locations
around the world do not support the idea that the building blocks of
life were synthesized due to the extreme conditions found at deep sea
vents. Similarly, (D) provides evidence for the RNA world hypothesis,
not the deep sea vents model.
