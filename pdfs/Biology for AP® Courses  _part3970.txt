(including certain medical treatments), malnutrition, or possibly by extreme stress. For instance, radiation exposure
can destroy populations of lymphocytes and elevate an individual’s susceptibility to infections and cancer. Dozens of
genetic disorders result in immunodeficiencies, including Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), Bare lymphocyte
syndrome, and MHC II deficiencies. Rarely, primary immunodeficiencies that are present from birth may occur.
