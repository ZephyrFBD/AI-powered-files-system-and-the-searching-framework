 temperature is 
much larger than what we experience on Earth. What fac-
tor plays the largest role in this wide temperature variation, 
the composition or the density of the atmosphere?
Earth’s Water (Section 18.3)
 18.37  What is the molarity of Na+ in a solution of NaCl whose 
salinity is 5.6 if the solution has a density of 1.03 g>mL?
 18.38  Phosphorus is present in seawater to the extent of 0.07 
ppm by mass. Assuming that the phosphorus is present as 
dihydrogenphosphate, H2PO4
-, calculate the correspond-
ing molar concentration of H2PO4
- in seawater.
 18.39  The enthalpy of evaporation of water is 40.67 kJ>mol. 
Sunlight striking Earth’s surface supplies 168 W per square 
 
meter 11 W = 1 watt = 1 J>s2. (a) Assuming that evapo-
ration of water is due only to energy input from the Sun, 
calculate how many grams of water could be evaporated 
from a 1.00 square meter patch of ocean over a 12-h day. 
 
(b) The specific heat capacity of liquid water is 4.184 J>g °C.
