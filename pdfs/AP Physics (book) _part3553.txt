 predicted in the 1960s but whose first suggestions
of experimental detection came only in 2011–2013. The theory that describes 
our present view is called the Standard Model. How we came to our present
understanding of elementary particles is the subject of this Chapter.
One of the exciting developments of the last few years is an emerging synthesis
between the study of elementary particles and astrophysics (Chapter 33). In fact,
recent observations in astrophysics have led to the conclusion that the greater
part of the mass–energy content of the universe is not ordinary matter but two
mysterious and invisible forms known as “dark matter” and “dark energy” which
cannot be explained by the Standard Model in its present form.
Indeed, we are now aware that the Standard Model is not sufficient. There
are problems and important questions still unanswered, and we will mention
some of them in this Chapter and how we hope to answer them.
