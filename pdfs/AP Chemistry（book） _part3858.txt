mine the identities of the alcohol and acid from 
which it is formed. We can identify the alcohol by adding an OH 
to the alkyl group attached to the O atom of the carboxyl (COO) 
group. We can identify the acid by adding an H to the O atom of the 
carboxyl group. We have learned that the first part of an ester name 
indicates the alcohol portion and the second indicates the acid por-
tion. The name conforms to how the ester undergoes hydrolysis in 
base, reacting with base to form an alcohol and a carboxylate anion.

(a) This ester is derived from ethanol 1CH3CH2OH2 and benzoic 
acid 1C6H5COOH2. Its name is therefore ethyl benzoate.  
The net ionic equation for reaction of ethyl benzoate with 
hydroxide ion is

The products are benzoate ion and ethanol.
(b) This ester is derived from phenol 1C6H5OH2 and butanoic acid 
(commonly called butyric acid) 1CH3CH2CH2COOH2. The 
residue from the phenol is called the phenyl group. The este
