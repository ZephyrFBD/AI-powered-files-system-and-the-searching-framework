= 3Ni2+4cathode. Oxida-
tion of Ni(s) occurs in the half-cell containing the more dilute solution, which means this 
is the anode of the cell. Reduction of Ni2+1aq2 occurs in the half-cell containing the more 
concentrated solution, making it the cathode. The overall cell reaction is therefore
Anode: 
 
 
   Ni1s2 ¡ Ni2+1aq, dilute2 + 2 e- 
Cathode: 
Ni2+1aq, concentrated2 + 2 e- ¡ Ni1s2 
Overall:  
    Ni2+1aq, concentrated2 ¡ Ni2+1aq, dilute2 
We can calculate the emf of a concentration cell by using the Nernst equation. For 
this particular cell, we see that n = 2. The expression for the reaction quotient for the 
overall reaction is Q = 3Ni2+4dilute>3Ni2+4concentrated. Thus, the emf at 298 K is
 
E = E° - 0.0592 V

This concentration cell generates an emf of nearly 0.09 V, even though E° = 0. The differ-
ence in concentration provides the driving force for the cell. W
