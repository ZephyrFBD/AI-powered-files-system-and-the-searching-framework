rm CO2. Hydrocarbon 
oxidation probably proceeds somewhat similarly, with the hydrocar-
bons first being adsorbed followed by rupture of a C Â¬ H bond.
Transition-metal oxides and noble metals are also the most 
effective catalysts for reduction of NO to N2 and O2. The catalysts 
that are most effective in one reaction, however, are usually much 
less effective in the other. It is therefore necessary to have two cata-
lytic components.
Catalytic converters contain remarkably efficient heteroge-
neous catalysts. The automotive exhaust gases are in contact with 
the catalyst for only 100 to 400 ms, but in this very short time, 96% 
of the hydrocarbons and CO is converted to CO2 and H2O, and the 
emission of nitrogen oxides is reduced by 76%.
Although the exact combination of catalysts used varies from 
one catalytic converter to another, precious metals are an essential 
component of any catalytic converter. Platinum is very good at cat-
alyzing the oxidation reactions and has good resist
