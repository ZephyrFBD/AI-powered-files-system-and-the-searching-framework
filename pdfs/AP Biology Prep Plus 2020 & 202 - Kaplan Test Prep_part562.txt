9. The Ras gene is mutated in many forms of cancer. Given that this
pathway leads to the transcription of genes involved in mitosis,
which of the following would most likely lead to cancerous cell
proliferation?
mutation of Ras so that the protein it encodes constantly
phosphorylates Raf
(A)
mutation of Ras so that the protein it encodes no longer
phosphorylates Raf
(B)
mutation of Ras so that the protein it encodes phosphorylates
MAPK instead of MAP3K
(C)
mutation of Ras so that the protein it encodes cannot interact
with Sos
(D)
10. Researchers isolate mRNA molecules from several muscle types of
the same animal. These mRNA are transcribed from the gene
encoding the protein myoglobin. The mRNA molecules are
purified by binding them to beads coated with poly(T). The
binding is accomplished using a polymer of thymidine residues
(polydT), which binds to poly-adenosine tails. Gel electrophoresis
shows that
