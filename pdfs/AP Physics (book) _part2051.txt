e. The symbol 
is usually used for emf (don’t confuse 
with E for electric field), and its unit is volts.
A battery is not a source of constant current—the current out of a battery
varies according to the resistance in the circuit. A battery is, however, a nearly
constant voltage source, but not perfectly constant as we now discuss. For example,
if you start a car with the headlights on, you may notice the headlights dim. This
happens because the starter draws a large current, and the battery voltage drops below
its rated emf as a result. The voltage drop occurs because the chemical reactions in
a battery cannot supply charge fast enough to maintain the full emf. For one thing,
charge must move (within the electrolyte) between the electrodes of the battery,
and there is always some hindrance to completely free flow. Thus, a battery itself
has some resistance, which is called its internal resistance; it is usually designated r.
A real battery is modeled as if it were a perfect emf
