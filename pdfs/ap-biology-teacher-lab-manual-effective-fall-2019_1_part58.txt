•  What other factors might affect whether or not the fruit flies moved from one part of 
your choice chamber to another? 
•  Do you think that it is the fruit itself that attracts the flies? Should they be called fruit 
flies or something else? 
•  Some experiments could be designed using fruit fly larvae. Do larvae respond the 
same way that adults respond? Are there other factors in the environment that affect 
the choice? 
•  What factors must be controlled in an experiment about environmental variables and 
behavior? 
•  What is the difference among phototaxis, chemotaxis, and geotaxis? Do fruit flies 
demonstrate all of them? 
• Does a phototactic response override a chemotactic response? 
• Does the age of the fruit fly change its geotactic response? 
•  Are there other organisms that respond the same as fruit flies? Are there other 
organisms that respond differently from fruit flies?
