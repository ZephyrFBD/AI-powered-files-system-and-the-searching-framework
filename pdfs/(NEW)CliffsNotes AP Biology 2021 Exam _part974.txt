1 pt: Photoperiodism is the response to changes in the photoperiod, or
the relative length of daylight and night.
1 pt: Photoperiodism requires the maintenance of a clock that
measures the length of day or night (circadian rhythm). 1 pt: Two forms of phytochrome regulate photoperiodism. b.
(2 points maximum for any two elements that apply to one mechanism)
1 pt: Animals maintain a circadian rhythm that allows them to regulate
behaviors (such as sleep) in response to day/night cycles. 1 pt: In humans, circadian rhythms are maintained by the
hormone
melatonin.
1 pt: In humans, jet lag is the feeling of fatigue as a result of moving
across time zones.
1 pt: In humans, jet lag results from the time required to realign the
circadian rhythm (biological clock) with the environmental cues
of the new time zone.
1 pt: Humans and other animals respond to cold temperatures by
shivering.
1 pt: Shivering warms the body by the heat produced by contracting
muscles.
