 per second this represents. Take the average wave-
length to be 550 nm.
71. A beam of red laser light 
hits a black wall
and is fully absorbed. If this light exerts a total force
on the wall, how many photons per second are
hitting the wall?
72. A flashlight emits 2.5 W of light. As the light leaves the
flashlight in one direction, a reaction force is exerted on
the flashlight in the opposite direction. Estimate the size of
this reaction force.
73. A photomultiplier tube (a very sensitive light sensor), is
based on the photoelectric effect: incident photons strike a
metal surface and the resulting ejected electrons are
collected. By counting the number of collected electrons,
the number of incident photons (i.e., the incident light
intensity) can be determined. (a) If a photomultiplier tube
is to respond properly for incident wavelengths through-
out the visible range (410 nm to 750 nm), what is the
maximum value for the work function 
(eV) of its metal
surface? (b) If 
for its metal
