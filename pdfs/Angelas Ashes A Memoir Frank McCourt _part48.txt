 Classon Avenue. 
 
 We race the pram around the playground and the twins laugh and 
 
 make goo-goo sounds till they get hungry and start to cry. There are 
 
 two bottles in the pram filled with water and sugar and that keeps them 
 
 quiet for awhile till they’re hungry again and they cry so hard I don’t 
 
 know what to do because they’re so small and I wish I could give them 
 
 all kinds of food so that they’d laugh and make the baby sounds.They 
 
 love the mushy food Mam makes in a pot, bread mashed up in milk and 
 
 water and sugar. Mam calls it bread and goody. 
 
 If I take the twins home now Mam will yell at me for giving her no 
 
 rest or for waking Margaret.We are to stay in the playground till she 
 
 sticks her head out the window and calls for us. I make funny faces for 
 
 the twins to stop their crying. I put a piece of paper on my head and let 
 
 it fall and they laugh and laugh. I push the pram over to Malachy playing 
 
 on the swings with Freddie Leibowit
