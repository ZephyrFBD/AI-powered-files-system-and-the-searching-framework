ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an extensive network of membrane-
enclosed spaces in the cytoplasm. The interior of the ER between
membrane layers is called the lumen, and at points in the ER, the lumen
is continuous with the nuclear envelope. If a region of the ER has
ribosomes lining its outer surface, it is termed rough endoplasmic
reticulum (rough ER); without ribosomes, it is known as smooth
endoplasmic reticulum (smooth ER). Smooth ER is involved in lipid
synthesis and the detoxification of drugs and poisons, and it has the
appearance of a network of tubes, while rough ER is involved in protein
synthesis and is a series of stacked plates.Â 
Proteins that are secreted or found in the cell membrane, the ER, or the
Golgi are made by ribosomes on the rough ER. Proteins synthesized on
the rough ER cross into the lumen of the rough ER during synthesis. The
presence of a hydrophobic sequence of amino acids at the amino
terminus of proteins dete
