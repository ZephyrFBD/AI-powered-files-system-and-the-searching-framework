survive. In robins, the average clutch size is five to six eggs per nest.
Figure 19.4 shows a graph that represents stabilizing selection.

Disruptive Selection
Sometimes, natural selection can lead to disruptive selection, where individuals on both extremes of the phenotypic
range are more likely to survive and reproduce than individuals with an intermediate phenotype. Consider a habitat
with light-colored sandy soil that is interspersed with dark, rocky patches. Mice with light-colored fur in this habitat
could blend in with the sandy soil and be less visible to predators. Mice with dark-colored fur could hide in the dark-
colored rocks. Mice with an intermediate fur color could not blend in with either the soil or the rocks; they would be
more visible to predators and less likely to survive and reproduce. Figure 19.5 represents disruptive selection.

Directional, stabilizing, and disruptive selection all rely on the me
