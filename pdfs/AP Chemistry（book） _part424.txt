them up in tables (such as atomic weights). Recognize also that 
your plan may involve either a single step or a series of steps with 
intermediate answers.
3.  
Solve the problem. Use the known information and suitable 
 
equations or relationships to solve for the unknown. Dimen-
sional analysis 
 (Section 1.7) is a useful tool for solving a 
great number of problems. Be careful with significant figures, 
signs, and units.
4.  
Check the solution. Read the problem again to make sure you 
have found all the solutions asked for in the problem. Does your 
answer make sense? That is, is the answer outrageously large or 
small or is it in the ballpark? Finally, are the units and significant 
figures correct?
