own, and does not have the same physiological effect. (b) For relieving 
pain and reducing inflammation, the ability of this enantiomer far outweighs that of the (R) isomer. 
In the (R) isomer, the positions of the H and CH3 group on the far-right carbon are switched.
24.6 ∣ Introduction to Biochemistry
The functional groups discussed in Section 24.4 generate a vast array of molecules with 
very specific chemical reactivities. Nowhere is this specificity more apparent than in bio-
chemistry—the chemistry of living organisms.
Before we discuss specific biochemical molecules, we can make some general obser-
vations. Many biologically important molecules are quite large because organisms build 
biomolecules from smaller, simpler substances readily available in the biosphere. The 
synthesis of large molecules requires energy because most of the reactions are endother-
mic. The ultimate source of this energy is the Sun. Animals have essentially no capacity 
for using solar energy directly a
