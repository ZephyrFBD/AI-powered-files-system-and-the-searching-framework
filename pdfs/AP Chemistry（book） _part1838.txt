act that most metals are relatively strong without being brittle. 
Ionic solids are held together by the mutual electrostatic attraction between cations 
and anions. Differences between ionic and metallic bonding make the electrical and 
mechanical properties of ionic solids very different from those of metals: Ionic solids do 
not conduct electricity well and are brittle. Covalent-network solids are held together 
by an extended network of covalent bonds. This type of bonding can result in materials 
that are extremely hard, like diamond, and it is also responsible for the unique proper-
ties of semiconductors. Molecular solids are held together by the intermolecular forces 
we studied in Chapter 11: dispersion forces, dipoleâ€“dipole interactions, and hydrogen 
bonds. Because these forces are relatively weak, molecular solids tend to be soft and have 
low melting points.
We will also consider two classes of solids that do not fall neatly into the preced-
ing categories: polymers and na
