 the real-world perspective of chemistry 
and the ways in which chemistry affects their lives.
It is perhaps a natural tendency for chemistry textbooks 
to grow in length with succeeding editions, but it is one that 
we have resisted. There are, nonetheless, many new items in 
this edition, mostly ones that replace other material consid-
ered less pertinent. Here is a list of several significant changes 
in content:
Chapter 1, and every chapter that follows, begins with a 
new chapter opening photo and backstory to provide a real 
world context for the material that follows. A new section on 
the nature of energy (Section 1.4) has been added to Chapter 1. 
The inclusion of energy in the opening chapter provides much 
greater flexibility for the order in which subsequent chapters 
can be covered. The Chemistry Put To Work box, dealing with 
Chemistry in the News, has been completely rewritten, with items 
that describe diverse ways in which chemistry intersects with 
the affairs of mode
