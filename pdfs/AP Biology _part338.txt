Binary fission results in a population with all identical genes, but
mutations do occur spontaneously. Although mutations are rare, bacteria
reproduce by the millions, and even one mutation in every 1,000
replications can amount to significant variation in the population as a
whole.

In general, prokaryotes have circular chromosomes while eukaryotes have multiple,
linear chromosomes.
Bacterial transformation was discovered by Frederick Griffith
in 1928 when he performed experiments with several different
strains of the bacterium Diplococcus pneumoniae.
Transformation is either a natural or an artificial process that
provides a mechanism for the recombination of genetic information
in some bacteria. Small pieces of extracellular DNA are taken up by
a living bacterium, ultimately leading to a stable genetic change in
the recipient cell. Bacterial transformation is very easy to carry out
today.
A plasmid is a foreign, small, circular, self-replicating DNA
