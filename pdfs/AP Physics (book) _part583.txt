we plot 
the component of 
parallel to the direction of motion 
at any point) as a function of distance d, as in Fig. 6–6a. We divide the distance
into small segments 
For each segment, we indicate the average of 
by a
horizontal dashed line. Then the work done for each segment is  
which is the area of a rectangle 
wide and 
high. The total work done to
move the object a total distance
is the sum of the areas of the 
rectangles (five in the case shown in Fig. 6–6a). Usually, the average value of 
for each segment must be estimated, and a reasonable approximation of the work
done can then be made.
If we subdivide the distance into many more segments,
can be made smaller
and our estimate of the work done would be more accurate. In the limit as 
approaches zero, the total area of the many narrow rectangles approaches the
area under the curve, Fig. 6–6b. That is, the work done by a variable force in
moving an object between two points is equal to the area under the
vs. d curve
between th
