 asked to deter-
mine the number of chiral carbons in the molecule.
Plan A chiral carbon has four different groups attached  
(Section 24.5). We need to identify those carbon atoms in glucose.

SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 24.8 
Identifying Functional Groups and Chiral Centers in Carbohydrates
Thus, there are four chiral carbon atoms in 
the glucose molecule.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
How many chiral carbon atoms are there in the open-chain 
form of fructose (Figure 24.19)?
(a) 0 (b) 1 (c) 2 (d) 3 (e) 4
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Name the functional groups present in the beta form of 
glucose.
disaccharides
Both glucose and fructose are examples of monosaccharides, simple sugars that cannot 
be broken into smaller molecules by hydrolysis with aqueous acids. Two monosaccharide 
units can be
