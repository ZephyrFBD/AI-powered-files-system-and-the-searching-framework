outside a spherical conductor. Thus, the electric field outside a spherically symmetric
distribution of charge is the same as for a point charge of the same magnitude at
the center of the sphere. This result applies also outside a uniformly charged
nonconductor, because we can use the same gaussian surface 
(Fig. 16–45) and
the same symmetry argument. We can also consider this a demonstration of our
statement in Chapter 5 about the gravitational force, which is also a perfect 
force: The gravitational force exerted by a uniform sphere is the same as if all the
mass were at the center, as stated on page 120.

(b) Inside the shell, the electric field must also be symmetric. So E must again
have the same value at all points on a spherical gaussian surface (
in Fig.16–45)
concentric with the shell. Thus, E can be factored out of the sum and, with
because the charge inside surface 
is zero, we have
