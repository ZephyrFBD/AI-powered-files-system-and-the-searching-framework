as, assuming it behaves like an ideal gas, at STP.
APPROACH We use the ideal gas law, solving for V with
SOLUTION We solve for V in Eq. 13–3:
Since 1 liter (L) is
1.00 mol of any (ideal) gas has
volume  
at STP.
V = 22.4 L
1000 cm3 = 1.00 * 10–3 m3,
V = nRT
P
=
(1.00 mol)(8.314 JmolK)(273 K)
A1.013 * 105 Nm2B
= 22.4 * 10–3 m3.
n = 1.00 mol.
EXAMPLE 13;9
The value of 22.4 L for the volume of 1 mol of an ideal gas at STP is worth
remembering, for it sometimes makes calculation simpler.
EXERCISE C What is the volume of 1.00 mol of ideal gas at
and
2.0 atm absolute pressure? (a) 11.2 L; (b) 22.4 L; (c) 44.8 L; (d) 67.2 L; (e) 89.6 L.
546 K (= 2 * 273 K)
IDEAL GAS LAW
Helium balloon. A helium party balloon, assumed to be
a perfect sphere, has a radius of 18.0 cm. At room temperature (20°C), its internal
pressure is 1.05 atm. Find the number of moles of helium in the balloon and the
mass of helium needed to inflate the balloon to these values.
APPROACH We can use the ideal gas law to find
