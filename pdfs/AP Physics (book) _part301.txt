3;2 to 3;4 Vector Addition
1. (I) A car is driven 225 km west and then 98 km southwest
(45°). What is the displacement of the car from the point 
of origin (magnitude and direction)? Draw a diagram.
2. (I) A delivery truck travels 21 blocks north, 16 blocks east,
and 26 blocks south. What is its final displacement from
the origin? Assume the blocks are equal length.
3. (I) If  
and  
determine
the magnitude and direction of 
4. (II) Graphically determine the resultant of the following
three vector displacements: (1) 24 m, 36° north of east;
(2) 18 m, 37° east of north; and (3) 26 m, 33° west of south.
5. (II)

angle of 23.4° above the negative x axis. (a) Sketch this
vector. (b) Calculate
