 tissue, which is categorized as either simple or complex. Simple tissues are made up of
similar cell types; examples include dermal tissue and ground tissue. Dermal tissue provides the outer covering of the
plant. Ground tissue is responsible for photosynthesis; it also supports vascular tissue and may store water and sugars.
Complex tissues are made up of different cell types. Vascular tissue, for example, is made up of xylem and phloem cells.
23.2 Stems
The stem of a plant bears the leaves, flowers, and fruits. Stems are characterized by the presence of nodes (the points of
attachment for leaves or branches) and internodes (regions between nodes).
Plant organs are made up of simple and complex tissues. The stem has three tissue systems: dermal, vascular, and ground
tissue. Dermal tissue is the outer covering of the plant. It contains epidermal cells, stomata, guard cells, and trichomes.
Vascular tissue is made up of xylem and phloem tissues and conducts water, minerals, and photosyn
