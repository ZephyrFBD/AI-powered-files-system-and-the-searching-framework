20–3 Force on an Electric Current in a
Magnetic Field; Definition of 
In Section 20–2 we saw that an electric current exerts a force on a magnet, such as
a compass needle. By Newton’s third law, we might expect the reverse to be true
as well: we should expect that a magnet exerts a force on a current-carrying wire.
Experiments indeed confirm this effect, and it too was first observed by Oersted.
Suppose a straight wire is placed in the magnetic field between the poles of a
horseshoe magnet as shown in Fig. 20–11, where the vector symbol 
represents
the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field. When a current flows in the wire,
experiment shows that a force is exerted on the wire. But this force is not toward
one or the other pole of the magnet. Instead, the force is directed at right angles
to the
