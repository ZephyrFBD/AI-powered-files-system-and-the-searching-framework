point b, nearly all are aligned. The iron is said to be approaching saturation.

Next, suppose current in the coil is reduced, so the field 
decreases. If the current
(and 
) is reduced to zero, point c in Fig. 20–46, the domains do not become
completely random. Instead, some permanent magnetism remains in the iron
core. If the current is increased in the opposite direction, enough domains can be
turned around so the total B becomes zero at point d. As the reverse current is
increased further, the iron approaches saturation in the opposite direction, point e.
Finally, if the current is again reduced to zero (point f) and then increased in 
the original direction, the total field f
