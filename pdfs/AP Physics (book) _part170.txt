2–7 Freely Falling Objects
One of the most common examples of uniformly accelerated motion is that of
an object allowed to fall freely near the Earth’s surface. That a falling object is
accelerating may not be obvious at first. And beware of thinking, as was widely
believed before the time of Galileo (Fig. 2–18), that heavier objects fall fas
