36. (II) You buy a 75-W lightbulb in Europe, where electricity
is delivered at 240 V. If you use the bulb in the United States
at 120 V (assume its resistance does not change), how bright
will it be relative to 75-W 120-V bulbs? [Hint: Assume
roughly that brightness is proportional to power consumed.]
37. (II) How many kWh of energy does a 550-W toaster use in
the morning if it is in operation for a total of 5.0 min? At a
cost of 
estimate how much this would add
to your monthly electric energy bill if you made toast four
mornings per week.
38. (II) At 
what does it cost to leave a 25-W
porch light on day and night for a year?
39. (II) What is the total amount of energy stored in a 12-V,
car battery when it is fully charged?
40. (II) An ordinary flashlight uses two D-cell 1.5-V batteries
connected in series to provide 3.0 V across the bulb, as in
Fig.18–4b (Fig.18–36). The bulb draws 380 mA when turned
on. (a) Calculate the resistance of the bulb and the power dis-
sipated. (b) By
