available in different forms. For example, objects in motion possess kinetic energy,
whereas objects that are not in motion possess potential energy. The chemical energy in molecules, such as glucose, is
potential energy because when bonds break in chemical reactions, free energy is released. Free energy is a measure of
energy that is available to do work. The free energy of a system changes during energy transfers such as chemical reactions,
and this change is referred to as ΔG or Gibbs free energy. The ΔG of a reaction can be negative or positive, depending on
whether the reaction releases energy (exergonic) or requires energy input (endergonic). All reactions require an input of
energy called activation energy in order to reach the transition state at which they will proceed. (In another section, we will
explore how enzymes speed up chemical reactions by lowering activation energy barriers.)
