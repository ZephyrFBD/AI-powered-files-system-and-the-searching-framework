ater number of species tend to survive the disturbance in
species-rich communities as opposed to species-poor communities.

Species Interactions
A. Population Interactions—interactions that occur with different species living in a community; can be
beneficial to the species, but can also be detrimental to one or both of them.
B. Symbioses—close species relationships between a host and a symbiont
1. Mutualism—both species benefit from the relationship.
2. Commensalism—a relationship in which one species benefits while the other species is neither harmed
nor helped.
3. Parasitism—beneficial to the parasite and detrimental—but not usually immediately fatal—to the
host.
Symbioses may involve close coevolution where each species evolves in response to a change in the other species. Questions
that require you to integrate material from different topics in biology are common on the AP® Biology exam, so be aware of
these relationships as you study; for example, ecology and evolution are cl
