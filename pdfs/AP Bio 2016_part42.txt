 data points divided by number of data points 
Range = value obtained by subtracting the smallest observation (sample minimum) from the greatest (sample maximum) 
-4-
pH = – log10 [H+] 
T2 = higher temperature 
T1 = lower temperature 
k2 = reaction rate at T2 
k1 = reaction rate at T1 
Q10 = the factor by which the 
reaction rate increases when 
the temperature is raised by 
ten degrees 
Dilution (used to create a dilute solution from a 
concentrated stock solution) 
CiVi = CfVf
i = initial (starting) 
C = concentration of solute 
f = final   (desired) 
V = volume of solution
