An example of this process occurs in the kidney. Glucose, water, salts, ions, and amino acids needed by the body are filtered
in one part of the kidney. This filtrate, which includes glucose, is then reabsorbed in another part of the kidney. Because
there are only a finite number of carrier proteins for glucose, if more glucose is present than the proteins can handle, the
excess is not transported and it is excreted from the body in the urine. In a diabetic individual, this is described as “spilling
glucose into the urine.” A different group of carrier proteins called glucose transport proteins, or GLUTs, are involved in
transporting glucose and other hexose sugars through plasma membranes within the body.
Channel and carrier proteins transport material at different rates. Channel proteins transport much more quickly than do
carrier proteins. Channel p
