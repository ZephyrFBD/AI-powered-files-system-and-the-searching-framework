n. In the 
2000s, a new technique was developed, called prepolarized MRI, that 
 
requires much less expensive equipment and will lead to an even 
greater  
application of this important diagnostic tool.

In this representation, which we call an orbital diagram, each orbital is denoted by 
a box and each electron by a half arrow. A half arrow pointing up 1
t
 2 represents an electron 
with a positive spin magnetic quantum number 1ms = + 1
22, and a half arrow pointing down 
1 
t
2 represents an electron with a negative spin magnetic quantum number 1ms = - 1
22. 
This pictorial representation of electron spin, which corresponds to the directions of the 
 magnetic fields in Figure 6.26, is quite convenient. Chemists refer to the two possible spin 
states as “spin-up” and “spin-down” corresponding to the directions o
