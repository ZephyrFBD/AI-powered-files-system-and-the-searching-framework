 (70s). The “s” is
a unit of measurement used to compare sizes of small things. In general,
prokaryotic ribosomes are exclusively found freely in the cytoplasm, whereas
eukaryotic ribosomes can also be found attached to the endoplasmic
reticulum. The fact that both eukaryotes and prokaryotes possess ribosomes
underlines the common ancestry of all known life.
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a continuous channel that extends into many regions of the cytoplasm. The
region of the ER that is attached to the nucleus and “studded” with ribosomes is called the rough ER (RER).
Proteins generated in the rough ER are trafficked to or across the plasma membrane, or they are used to build Golgi
bodies, lysosomes, or the ER. The region of the ER that lacks ribosomes is called the smooth ER (SER). The
smooth ER makes lipids, hormones, and steroids and breaks down toxic chemicals.
The flattened membrane disks of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi
apparatus are called cist
