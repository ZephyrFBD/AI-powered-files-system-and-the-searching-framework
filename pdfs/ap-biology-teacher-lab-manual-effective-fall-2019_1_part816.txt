LAWS OF PROBABILITY 
If A and B are mutually exclusive, then: 
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) 
If A and B are independent, then: 
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B) 
HARDY-WEINBERG EQUATIONS 
p = frequency of allele 1 in a 
population 
q = frequency of allele 2 in a 
 
population

p 
Mode = value that occurs most frequently in a data set 
Median = middle value that separates the greater and lesser halves of a data set 
Mean = sum of all data points divided by number of data points 
Range = value obtained by subtracting the smallest observation (sample minimum) from the greatest (sample maximum)
