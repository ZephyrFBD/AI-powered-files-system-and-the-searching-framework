ncy when the number of oxytocin receptors in the
uterus peaks. Stretching of tissues in the uterus and cervix stimulates oxytocin release during childbirth. Contractions
increase in intensity as blood levels of oxytocin rise via a positive feedback mechanism until the birth is complete. Oxytocin
also stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells around the milk-producing mammary glands. As these cells contract,
milk is forced from the secretory alveoli into milk ducts and is ejected from the breasts in milk ejection (“let-down”) reflex.
Oxytocin release is stimulated by the suckling of an infant, which triggers the synthesis of oxytocin in the hypothalamus
and its release into circulation at the posterior pituitary.
Hormonal Regulation of Metabolism
Blood glucose levels vary widely over the course of a day as periods of food consumption alternate with periods of fasting.
Insulin and glucagon are the two hormones primarily responsible for maintaining homeostasis of blood glucose lev
