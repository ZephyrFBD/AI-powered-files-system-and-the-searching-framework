ng correctly identifies the products (per
molecule of pyruvate) that would be generated if a person were to
consume a diet that consisted only of pyruvate, rather than
glucose?
If the individual were only undergoing aerobic respiration, 4
molecules of NADH and 1 molecule of FADH2, in addition to 1
molecule of ATP would be generated in the Krebs cycle. The
NADH and FADH2 would then go through the electron
transport chain, where they would be used to generate
additional ATP.

If the individual were only undergoing aerobic respiration, 4
molecules of NAD+ and 1 molecule of FAD, in addition to 1
molecule of ATP would be generated in the Krebs cycle. The
NAD+ and FAD would then go through the electron transport
chain, where they would be used to generate additional ATP.
(B)
If the individual were only undergoing aerobic respiration, 7
molecules of NAD+ and 2 molecule of FAD, in addition to 2
molecules of ATP would be generated through glycolysis and
the Krebs cycle. The NAD+ and FAD woul
