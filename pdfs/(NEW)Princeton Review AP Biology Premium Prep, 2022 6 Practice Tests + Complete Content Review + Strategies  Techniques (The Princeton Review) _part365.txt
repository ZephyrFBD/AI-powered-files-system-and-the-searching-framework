 a few large fragments.
When restriction fragments between individuals of the same species are compared, the fragments differ in length
because of polymorphisms, which are slight differences in DNA sequences. These fragments are called restriction
fragment length polymorphisms, or RFLPs. In DNA fingerprinting, RFLPs produced from DNA left at a crime
scene are compared to RFLPs from the DNA of suspects.
DNA Sequencing
An important tool of modern scientists is the process of DNA sequencing. This allows scientists to determine the
order of nucleotides in a DNA molecule. By knowing this, scientists could design their own DNA plasmid and use it
to study a gene of interest.
