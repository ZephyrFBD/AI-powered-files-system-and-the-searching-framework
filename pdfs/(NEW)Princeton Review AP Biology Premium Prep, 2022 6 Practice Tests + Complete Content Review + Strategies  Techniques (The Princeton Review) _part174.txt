 basic precursors. The experiment, shown in Figure 1, consisted of sealing basic organic chemicals
(representing the atmosphere of the primitive Earth) in a flask, which was exposed to electric sparks (to simulate
lightning) and water vapor.
Figure 1. Setup of 1953 Miller-Urey experiment
After one day of exposure, the mixture in the flask had turned pink in color, and later analysis showed that at least
10% of the carbon had been transformed into simple and complex organic compounds including at least 11 different
amino acids and some basic sugars. No nucleic acids were detected in the mixture.
4. Which of the following contradicts the hypothesis of the experiment that life may have arisen from the
formation of complex molecules in the conditions of the primitive Earth?
(A) Complex carbon-based compounds were generated after only one day of exposure to simulated primitive
Earth conditions.
(B) Nucleic acid compounds such as DNA and RNA were not detected in the mixture during the experi
