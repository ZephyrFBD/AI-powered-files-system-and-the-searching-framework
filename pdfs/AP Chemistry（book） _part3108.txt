 on your experience, is the vaporization a spon-
taneous process at room temperature? (b) Defining the 
1,1-difluoroethane as the system, do you expect qsys for 
the process to be positive or negative? (c) Predict whether 
∆S is positive or negative for this process. (d) Given your 
answers to (a), (b), and (c), do you think the operation of 
this product depends more on enthalpy or entropy? [Sec-
tions 19.1 and 19.2]

19.4  Predict the signs of ∆H and ∆S for this reaction. Explain 
your choice. [Section 19.3]
 
19.8  The accompanying diagram shows how ∆G for a hypothet-
ical reaction changes as temperature changes. (a) At what 
temperature is the system at equilibrium? (b) In what tem-
perature range is the reaction spontaneous? (c) Is ∆H posi-
tive or negative? (d) Is ∆S positive or negative? [Sections 19.5 
and 19.6]
