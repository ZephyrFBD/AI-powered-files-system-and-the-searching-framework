in many countries) which makes the “moving picture.” To form one frame, each
subpixel must have the correct brightness. We now describe one way of doing this.
The brightness of each LCD subpixel (Section 24–11) depends on the voltage
between its front and its back: if this voltage 
is zero, that subpixel is at maximum
brightness; if 
is at its maximum (which might be 
volts), that subpixel is dark.
Giving the correct voltage (to provide the correct brightness) is called
addressing the subpixel. Typically the front of the subpixel is maintained at a 
positive voltage, such as 
. On the back of the display, the voltage at each
subpixel is provided at the intersection of the 1080 horizontal wires (rows) and
vertical wires (columns). See Fig.17–33,which shows the
array, or matrix, of wires. Each intersection of one vertical and one horizontal wire
lies behind one subpixel. Because many frames are shown per second, the signal
voltages applied are brief, like a pulse (see Fig. 17-22b or 11–
