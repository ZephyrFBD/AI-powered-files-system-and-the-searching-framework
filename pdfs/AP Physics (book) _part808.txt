(c) The two components of linear acceleration calculated in parts (a) and (b) are
perpendicular to each other. Thus the total linear acceleration at 
has
magnitude
NOTE The linear acceleration at this chosen instant is mostly centripetal, and
keeps the child moving in a circle with the carousel. The tangential component
that speeds up the circular motion is smaller.
NOTE The direction of the linear acceleration (magnitude calculated above as
) is at the angle shown in Fig. 8–7b:
so
We can relate the angular velocity 
to the frequency of rotation, f. The 
frequency is the number of complete revolutions (rev) per second, as we saw in
Chapter 5. One revolution (of a wheel, say) corresponds to an angle of 
r
