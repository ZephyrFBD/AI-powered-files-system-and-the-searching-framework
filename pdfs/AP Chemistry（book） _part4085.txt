overall reaction occurs and explains the experimentally 
determined rate law. (d) A rate-determining step is the slow step in a 
reaction mechanism. It limits the overall reaction rate. 14.67 (a) Uni-
molecular, rate = k3Cl24 (b) bimolecular, rate = k3OCl-143H2O4 (c) 
bimolecular, rate = k3NO43Cl24 14.69 (a) Two intermediates, B and

of K (c) shift equilibrium to the left (d) no effect (e) no effect  
(f) shift equilibrium to the right 15.63 (a) No effect (b) no effect 
(c) no effect (d) increase equilibrium constant (e) no effect  
15.65 (a) ∆H° = -155.7 kJ (b) The reaction is exothermic, so the 
equilibrium constant will decrease with increasing temperature.  
(c) ∆n does not equal zero, so a change in volume at constant tem-
perature will affect the fraction of products in the equilibrium mix-
ture. 15.67 An increase in pressure favors formation of ozone. 15.69  
(a) Endothermic (b) The equilibrium constant increases. (c) The for-
