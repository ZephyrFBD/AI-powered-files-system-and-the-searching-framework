33. (II) A beam of light in air strikes a slab of glass 
and is partially reflected and partially refracted. Determine

34. (II) In searching the bottom of a pool at night, a watchman
shines a narrow beam of light from his flashlight, 1.3 m
above the water level, onto the surface of the water at a
point 2.5 m from his foot
at the edge of the pool
(Fig. 23–57). Where does
the spot of light hit the bot-
tom of the 2.1-m-deep
pool? Measure from the
bottom of the wall beneath
his foot.
44. (II) A certain lens focuses light from an object 1.55 m away
as an image 48.3 cm on the other side of the lens. What
type of lens is it and what is its focal length? Is the image
real or virtual?
45. (II) A 105-mm-focal-length lens is used to focus an image
on the sensor of a camera. The maximum distance all
