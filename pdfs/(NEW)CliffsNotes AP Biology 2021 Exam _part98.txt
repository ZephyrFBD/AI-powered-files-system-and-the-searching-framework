d do not require expenditure of energy. Rates of passive
transport increase with higher concentration gradients, higher temperatures, and smaller particle size. The different
passive transport processes are as follows:
1. Simple diffusion , or diffusion, is the net movement of substances from an area of higher concentration to an area
of lower concentration. This movement occurs as a result of the random and constant motion characteristic of all
molecules (or atoms or ions), motion that is independent from the motion of other molecules. Since, at any one time,
some molecules may be moving up the gradient and some molecules may be moving down the gradient (remember,
the motion is random), the word “net” is used to indicate the overall, eventual result of the movement. Ultimately, a
state of equilibrium is attained, where molecules are uniformly distributed but continue to move randomly.
2. Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane. When water mo
