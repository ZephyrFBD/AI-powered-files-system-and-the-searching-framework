3. (b) 5 points possible 
 
1 point 
Photosynthesis: production of O2 correlated with light changes (i.e., explains changes in shape of 
bright-day curve). The student must link photosynthesis to increase in light to increase in O2 
production. The student must use the term “photosynthesis” or an excellent replacement such as  
the chemical equation for the process. 
 
1 point 
Respiration: consumption of O2. Must link respiration to decrease in O2. The student must use the 
term “respiration” or an excellent replacement such as the chemical equation for the process or the 
name of another appropriate process such as “decomposition.”

Description of the interaction of the above: photosynthetic rate changes while respiration rate 
remains relatively constant.

Overcast prediction curve explanation 
• 
Reduced light leads to decreased photosynthetic O2 production, etc.   
• 
No point given if there is no predicti
