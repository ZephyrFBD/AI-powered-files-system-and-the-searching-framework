to a group, curling up into a ball, or
withdrawing the head or feet into feathers reduce exposed surface area and conserve heat.
4. Countercurrent exchange conserves body heat when a blood vessel with blood flowing toward an extremity is
adjacent to a blood vessel with blood returning from the extremity. Heat conduction from the warm blood to the
returning cold blood is redirected to internal parts of the body before reaching the extremity. This occurs, for
example, in the legs of wading birds.
In addition, all animals have various behavioral, physiological, or anatomical adaptations that increase their ability
to survive in a particular environment. To survive cold temperatures, for example, some animals hibernate, while
others have hair, feathers, or blubber. Some animals avoid heat by merely moving from sun to shade, while others
restrict their activity to nighttime.
The Respiratory System
Animal cells require O2for aerobic respiration. If cells are not directly exposed to the outsi
