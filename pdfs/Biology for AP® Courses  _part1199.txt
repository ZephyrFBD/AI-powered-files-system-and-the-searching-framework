ding human cells with thymidine. This
causes the cells to arrest at the G1 boundary. The cells are
then placed in medium lacking thymidine, which releases
the block, and the cells begin to divide again. Starting with
Sample A and ending with Sample D, the DNA content of
the cells is measured at different times after thymidine is
removed. Results for four samples (A-D) are shown in the
graph. Which sample presents the expected results for
cells in S-phase?
