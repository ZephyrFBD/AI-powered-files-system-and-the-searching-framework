 of a solid using a known liquid
(Example 10â€“8). The reverse can be done as well. (a) As
an example, a 3.80-kg aluminum ball has an apparent mass
of 2.10 kg when submerged in a particular liquid: calculate
the density of the liquid. (b) Determine a formula for finding
the density of a liquid using this procedure.
33. (II) A 32-kg child decides to make a raft out of empty 
1.0-L soda bottles and duct tape. Neglecting the mass of the
duct tape and plastic in the bottles, what minimum number
of soda bottles will the child need to be able stay dry on 
the raft?
34. (II) An undersea research chamber is spherical with an
external diameter of 5.20 m. The mass of the chamber, when
occupied, is 74,400 kg. It is anchored to the sea bottom by a
cable. What is (a) the buoyant force on the chamber, and
(b) the tension in the cable?
35. (II) A 0.48-kg piece of wood floats in water but is found 
to sink in alcohol 
in which it has an appar-
ent mass of 0.047 kg. What is the SG of the wood?
