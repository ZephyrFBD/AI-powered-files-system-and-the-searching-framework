, such as 609, there are
ten choices for each digit—from 0 to 9—and normal numbers are called decimal
(Latin for ten). In a binary number, each digit or bit has only two possibilities,
0 or 1 (sometimes referred to as “off” or “on”). In binary, 0001 means “one,”
0010 means 2, 0011 means 3, and 1101 means
in decimal.
See Table 17–4, and note that counting starts from the right, just as in regular
decimal (the “ones” digit is last, on the far right, then to the left is the “tens” and
then “hundreds”: for 609, the “ones” are 9, the “hundreds” are 6). Any value can
be represented by a voltage pattern something like that shown in Fig. 17–23.
8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13
