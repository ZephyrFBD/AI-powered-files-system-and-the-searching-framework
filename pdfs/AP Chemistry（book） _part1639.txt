+ 14.0 = 26.0 g>mol. Dividing the molar mass by that of its 
empirical formula gives 152.0 g>mol2>126.0 g>mol2 = 2.00. Thus, 
the molecule has twice as many atoms of each element as the  
empirical formula, giving the molecular formula C2N2.
 
Plan To determine the molecular structure, we must deter-
mine the Lewis structure.  
 (Section 8.5) We can then use 
the VSEPR model to predict the structure.  
 (Section 9.2)
Solve The molecule has 2142 + 2152 = 18 valence-shell electrons. 
By trial and error, we seek a Lewis structure with 18 valence elec-
trons in which each atom has an octet and the formal charges are 
as low as possible. The structure
:N ‚ C ¬ C ‚ N:
meets these criteria. (This structure has zero formal charge on 
each atom.)
The Lewis structure shows that each atom has two electron 
domains. (Each nitrogen has a nonbonding pair of electrons and 
a triple bond, whereas each carbon has a triple bond and a single 
bond.) Thus, the electron-domain geometry around each atom is
