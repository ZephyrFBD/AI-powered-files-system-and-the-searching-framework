s,”meaning
they can get close enough so that the electrostatic force
is strong enough
to form weak bonds. If the molecular shapes are not just right, there is almost no
electrostatic attraction, which is why there are so few mistakes. Thus, out of the ran-
dom motion of the molecules, the electrostatic force acts to bring order out of chaos.

The random (thermal) velocities of molecules in a cell affect cloning. When a
bacterial cell divides, the two new bacteria have nearly identical DNA. Even if
the DNA were perfectly identical, the two new bacteria would not end up behaving
in exactly the same way. Long protein, DNA, and RNA molecules get bumped into
different shapes, and even the expression† of genes can thus be different. Loosely
held parts of large molecules such as a methyl group 
can also be knocked
off by a strong collision with another molecule. Hence, cloned organisms are not
identical, even if their DNA were identical. Indeed, there can not really be
genet
