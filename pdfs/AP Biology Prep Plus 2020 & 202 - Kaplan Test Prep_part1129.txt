ate the transfer eﬀiciency between trophic level D and trophic
level B for the desert ecosystem. Explain why ecosystems rarely have
more than 4 or 5 trophic levels.
(c)
An invasive predator was introduced in the temperate deciduous forest
ecosystem. Predict the short-term impact on the pyramid of biomass
for the ecosystem. Justify your prediction.
(d)
3. The mating of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) occurs between
two haploid mating types: a and α. A culture of a-type cells only was
incubated with and without the supernatant from a co-culture of a- and
α-type cells. The expression of genes in the pheromone and mating
pathways (ste 2, ste 3, and ste 12) is shown in the figure.
Describe how environmental factors aﬀect phenotypic plasticity, the
ability of one genotype to exhibit diﬀerent phenotypes in diﬀerent
environments.
(a)
Identify the control in the experiment.
(b)
In a diﬀerent experiment, a culture of α-type cells was incubated with
and without yeast mating pheromone. Th
