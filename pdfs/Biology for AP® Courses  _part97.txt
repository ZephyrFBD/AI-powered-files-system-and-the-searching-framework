nisms are remarkably complex: inside each cell, atoms make up molecules; these in turn make up cell organelles and
other cellular inclusions. In multicellular organisms (Figure 1.10), similar cells form tissues. Tissues, in turn, collaborate to
create organs (body structures with a distinct function). Organs work together to form organ systems.
Sensitivity or Response to Stimuli
Figure 1.11 The leaves of this sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) will instantly droop and fold when touched. After a few
minutes, the plant returns to normal. (credit: Alex Lomas)
Organisms respond to diverse stimuli. For example, plants can bend toward a source of light, climb on fences and walls, or
respond to touch (Figure 1.11). Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a process called chemotaxis)
or light (phototaxis). Movement toward a stimulus is considered a positive response, while movement away from a stimulus
is considered a negative response.
