s may seem illogical,
but think of it in terms of a piece of moving a heavy rope. It takes little effort by a person to move a rope in long, wide
waves. To make a rope move in short, tight waves, a person would need to apply significantly more energy.
The electromagnetic spectrum (Figure 8.11) shows several types of electromagnetic radiation originating from the sun,
including X-rays and ultraviolet (UV) rays. The higher-energy waves can penetrate tissues and damage cells and DNA,
explaining why both X-rays and UV rays can be harmful to living organisms.
Absorption of Light
Light energy initiates the process of photosynthesis when pigments absorb the light. Organic pigments, whether in the
human retina or the chloroplast thylakoid, have a narrow range of energy levels that they can absorb. Energy levels lower
than those represented by red light are insufficient to raise an orbital electron to a populatable, excited (quantum) state.
Energy levels higher than those in blue light will phy
