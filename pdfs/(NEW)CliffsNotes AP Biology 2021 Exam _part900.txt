he vessels
enclosing the control treatments.
d. graphed data (see example below) (2 points maximum)
1 pt: Axes are labeled, units provided, and scale is linear (equal
intervals anywhere on an axis represent the same amount of
change in the variable) (or if scale is logarithmic, it is so
identified).
1 pt: The independent variable is plotted on the x-axis and the
dependent variable is plotted on the y-axis.
1 pt: A title for graph is provided.
e. alternate hypothesis (1 point maximum)
1 pt: The decrease in pressure in the experimental treatment
(germinating seeds) could be the result of an uptake of gas other
than oxygen. (A means to analyze the gas inside the vessels
before and after the experiment is necessary.)
Question 3 (4 points maximum)
1 pt: DNA polymerase is the enzyme responsible for replication.
1 pt: The leading strand is replicated as the replicating enzyme moves toward the replication fork and continues as
the DNA unwinds.
1 pt: The lagging strand is replicated in the dire
