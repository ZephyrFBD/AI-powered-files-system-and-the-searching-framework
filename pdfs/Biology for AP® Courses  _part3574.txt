pharynx → trachea → larynx → bronchioles → bronchi
From the nasal cavity, air passes through the pharynx (throat) and the larynx (voice box), as it makes its way to the trachea
(Figure 30.7). The main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of
the body. The human trachea is a cylinder about 10 to 12 cm long and 2 cm in diameter that sits in front of the esophagus
and extends from the larynx into the chest cavity where it divides into the two primary bronchi at the midthorax. It is
made of incomplete rings of hyaline cartilage and smooth muscle (Figure 30.8). The trachea is lined with mucus-producing
goblet cells and ciliated epithelia. The cilia propel foreign particles trapped in the mucus toward the pharynx. The cartilage
provides strength and support to the trachea to keep the passage open. The smooth muscle can contract, decreasing the
trachea’s diameter, which causes expire
