 and is kicked into a new circu-
lar orbit with a speed of 1.5 v. What is the radius of the new
orbit in terms of r?
*90. Use dimensional analysis (Section 1–8) to obtain the form
for the centripetal acceleration, aR = v2r.

Problem 73.
85. A satellite of mass 5500 kg orbits the Earth and has a period
of 6600 s. Determine (a) the radius of its circular orbit,
(b) the magnitude of the Earth’s gravitational force on the
satellite, and (c) the altitude of the satellite.
86. Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope deduced
the presence of an extremely massive core in the distant
galaxy M87, so dense that it could be a black hole (from
which no light escapes). They did this by measuring the speed
of gas clouds orbiting the core to be 
at a distance
of 60 light-years
from the core. Deduce
the mass of the core, and compare it to the mass of our Sun.
87. Suppose all the mass of the Earth were compacted into a
small spherical ball. What radius must the sphere have so
that the ac
