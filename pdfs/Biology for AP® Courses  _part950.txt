ing out. Chloroplasts are found in the mesophyll cells and are where photosynthesis occurs. Gas is exchanged
through pores called stomata, which are opened and closed by the guard cells. Legend: 1) cuticle 2) upper
epidermis 3) palisade mesophyll 4) spongy mesophyll 5) lower epidermis 6) stoma 7) guard cells 8) xylem 9)
phloem 10) vascular bundle.
If the stomata were sealed, what would happen to oxygen (O2)
and carbon dioxide (CO2)
levels in a
photosynthesizing leaf?
a.
O2 levels would increase and CO2 levels would decrease.
b.
CO2 levels would increase and O2 levels would decrease.

c.
O2 and CO2 levels would both decrease.
d.
O2 and CO2 levels would both increase.
Think About It
On a hot, dry day, plants close their stomata to conserve water. Predict the impact of this on photosynthesis
and justify your prediction.
