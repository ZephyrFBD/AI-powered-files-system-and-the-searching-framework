Gibbs Free Energy 
ΔG = ΔH – TΔS 
ΔG = change in Gibbs free energy 
ΔS = change in entropy 
ΔH = change in enthalpy  
T = absolute temperature (in Kelvin)

Y  = solute potential 
 
The water potential will be equal to 
the solute potential of a solution in an 
open container because the pressure 
potential of the solution in an open 
container is zero.

i = ionization constant (this is 1.0 for 
sucrose because sucrose does not 
ionize in water)
