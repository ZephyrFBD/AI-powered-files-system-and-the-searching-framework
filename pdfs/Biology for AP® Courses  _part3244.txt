Wave amplitude is perceived as luminous intensity, or brightness. The standard unit of intensity of light is the candela,
which is approximately the luminous intensity of a one common candle.
Light waves travel 299,792 km per second in a vacuum, (and somewhat slower in various media such as air and water), and
those waves arrive at the eye as long (red), medium (green), and short (blue) waves. What is termed “white light” is light
that is perceived as white by the human eye. This effect is produced by light that stimulates equally the color receptors in
the human eye. The apparent color of an object is the color (or colors) that the object reflects. Thus a red object reflects the
red wavelengths in mixed (white) light and absorbs all other wavelengths of light.
