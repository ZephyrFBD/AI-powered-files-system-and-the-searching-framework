Then a new frame is started.The addressing of subpixels for each row of each frame
serves the same purpose as the sweep of the electron beam in a CRT, Fig. 17–30.
Active Matrix (advanced)
High-definition displays use an active matrix, meaning that a tiny thin-film
transistor (TFT) is attached to a corner of the back of each subpixel. (Transistors
are discussed in Section 29–10.) One electrode of each TFT, called the “source,” is
connected to the vertical wire which addresses that subpixel, Fig. 17–34, and the
“drain” electrode is connected to the back of the subpixel. The horizontal wire that
serves the subpixel is connected to the transistor’s gate electrode.The gate’s voltage,
by attracting charge or not, functions as a switch to connect o
