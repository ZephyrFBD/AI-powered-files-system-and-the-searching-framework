lectric charge, as the following simple experiments show. A plastic
ruler suspended by a thread is vigorously rubbed with a cloth to charge it. When
a second plastic ruler, which has been charged in the same way, is brought close
to the first, it is found that one ruler repels the other. This is shown in Fig. 16–2a.
Similarly, if a rubbed glass rod is brought close to a second charged glass rod,
again a repulsive force is seen to act, Fig. 16–2b. However, if the charged glass
rod is brought close to the charged plastic ruler, it is found that they attract each
other, Fig. 16–2c. The charge on the glass must therefore be different from that on
the plastic. Indeed, it is found experimentally that all charged objects fall into one
of two categories. Either they are attracted to the plastic and repelled by the glass;
or they are repelled by the plastic and attracted to the glass. Thus there seem to be
two, and only two, types of electric charge. Each type of charge repels the same type
but
