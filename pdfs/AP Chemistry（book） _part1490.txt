on 
between the nuclei and is called an antibonding molecular orbital. 
Antibonding MOs exclude electron density from the region between 
the nuclei and have a nodal plane—a place at which the electron den-
sity is zero—between the nuclei. Occupation of bonding MOs favors 
bond formation, whereas occupation of antibonding MOs is unfa-
vorable. The bonding and antibonding MOs formed by the combi-
nation of s orbitals are sigma 1S2  molecular orbitals; they lie on the 
internuclear axis.
The combination of atomic orbitals and the relative energies of 
the molecular orbitals are shown by an energy-level (or molecular or-
bital) diagram. When the appropriate number of electrons is put into 
the MOs, we can calculate the bond order of a bond, which is half 
 
the difference between the number of electrons in bonding MOs 
 
and the number of electrons in antibonding MOs. A bond order of 1 
corresponds to a single bond, and so forth. Bond orders can be frac-
tional numbers.
