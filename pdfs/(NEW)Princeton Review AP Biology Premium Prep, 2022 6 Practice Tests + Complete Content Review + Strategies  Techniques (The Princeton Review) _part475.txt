 be used for nonparametric data. These graphs show median (horizontal line),
quartiles (top and bottom of the box), and largest and smallest values (ticks at the tops and bottoms of the lines).
In other words, the middle 50% of plant weights is represented by the box, with the median shown with the line,
and the highest and lowest values are marked with the top and bottom extenders (whiskers). Remember, the
median is not the average, so the line doesnâ€™t have to be in the middle. Suppose the weights of two types of
Arizona plants are measured, to determine which is more plentiful in a given niche:
Grass and Cactus Weights in the Arizona Desert
In order to conclude that the samples or groups being compared are different or not, hypothesis testing should be
performed. This will be discussed later in this chapter.
Association Experiments
Association experiments look for associations between variables. They attempt to determine if two variables are
correlated, and additional tests can demon
