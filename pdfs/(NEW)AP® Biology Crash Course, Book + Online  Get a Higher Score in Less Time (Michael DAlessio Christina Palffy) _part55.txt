is.
i.
If extracellular fluids are hypotonic (low in solute concentration) compared to the cell, water will
enter the cell and may cause it to burst (lysis).
ii. If extracellular fluids are hypertonic (high in solute concentration) compared to the cell, water will
leave the cell and perhaps cause it to dry out (crenation).
3. Temperatureâ€”Cellular structures and the rates of crucial reactions can be affected by changes in
temperature.
i.
If temperatures are too low, cellular reactions may happen at too low of a rate to be effective.
ii. If temperatures are too high, chemical structures, like the tertiary structures of proteins, get
disrupted and become nonfunctional.
C. There are three structures necessary to respond to any homeostatic disruption.
1. The system needs a way to detect the change in the internal or external environment. This is called a
sensor (or receptor).
2. The system needs a way to initiate a response to the stimulus. This has to be a cell tissue or organ that
is the
