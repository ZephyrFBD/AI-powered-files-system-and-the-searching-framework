were deficient in the cell, it could
explain the existence of these short strands. (D) is thus correct. (A) is
incorrect because DNA must be unwound in order to be replicated, and
it is clear that some replication is occurring since the newly labeled
nucleotides are finding their way into DNA strands. (B) is incorrect
because there were no single-stranded DNA molecules (as indicated by
the unchanged results aȇer adding mung bean nuclease), so DNA
polymerase I must have filled in the gaps on the new strands. (C) is
incorrect because new strands were in fact synthesized.

Learning Objective: 13.4
In order for the same gene to produce two distinct mRNA transcripts,
diﬀerent exons from the gene must be spliced together for each
protein. Thus, alternative splicing in diﬀerent tissues explains the
existence of these proteins that come from the same gene, making (C)
correct. (A) is incorrect because mutations occur largely at random, so
it would be highly improbable to have two distinct p
