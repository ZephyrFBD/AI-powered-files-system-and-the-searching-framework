curs when neighboring
cells have died and been lysed. However, scientists utilize this
occurrence to introduce specific genes of interest into bacteria for
further study or for therapeutic processes. As a result, (B) and (C) are
both incorrect. Conjugation, as described in (C), is the direct transfer of
genetic material between bacteria while being temporarily joined. (A)
is incorrect because it describes horizontal transfer, which includes
transformation, transduction, conjugation, and transposition (the
movement of DNA segments within and between DNA molecules).
Vertical transfer is defined as the transmission of genetic material from
parents to oﬀspring during reproduction.
7. D
Learning Objective: 6.5
Pathway 1 is transformation (genetic transfer from loose genes in the
extracellular environment), pathway 2 is transduction (genetic transfer
using a virus), and pathway 3 is conjugation (genetic transfer using a
bacterial pilus). (D) is the appropriate match. (A), (B), and (C) each
