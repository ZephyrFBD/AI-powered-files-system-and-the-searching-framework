constant 
and not on the initial concentration: t1>2 = 0.693>k. The half-life of 
a second-order reaction depends on both the rate constant and the 
initial concentration of A: t1>2 = 1>1k3A402.
THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON RATES (SECTION 14.5) The 
collision model, which assumes that reactions occur as a result of 
collisions between molecules, helps explain why the magnitudes of 
rate constants increase with increasing temperature. The greater the 
kinetic energy of the colliding molecules, the greater is the energy 
of collision. The minimum energy required for a reaction to occur is 
called the activation energy, Ea. A collision with energy Ea or greater 
can cause the atoms of the colliding molecules to reach the activated 
complex (or transition state), which is the highest energy arrangement 
in the pathway from reactants to products. Even if a collision is ener-
getic enough, it may not lead to reaction; the reactants must also be 
correctly oriented relative to one another in
