d need to inherit the allele for
the trait from both parents in order to express it. When looking at a pedigree that shows more males with the trait
than females, it is likely the trait is coded for by a gene that is located on a sex chromosome, as shown in Figure
14.2.
TIP
Remember, in pedigrees, squares typically represent males and circles represent females. Shaded figures usually represent individuals who
possess the trait.
Figure 14.2 Pedigree for a Sex-Linked Trait
Examples of sex-linked recessive traits in humans include hemophilia and color blindness.
There are sex-linked dominant traits in humans, but these are very rare. If a male has a sex-linked dominant trait,
all of his daughters will inherit the trait because all females inherit an X chromosome from their father. If a female
has a sex-linked dominant trait, both her sons and daughters will have a 50% chance of inheriting the trait.
Multiple Gene Inheritance
Some traits are produced by multiple genes acting together to pr
