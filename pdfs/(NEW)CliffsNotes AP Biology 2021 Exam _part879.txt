he ascus labeled XIII, with unlike adjacent pairs, cannot occur. Exchanges between sister chromatids can
occur, but because sister chromatids are identical (except for replication errors), there is no reshuffling of genes.
27. B. A control is an independent variable at some normal or standard value. Data from the control treatment are
compared to the data from the experimental treatments. In this experiment, there are two independent variables. The
first is the environmental conditionâ€”humidity (Treatment A), wind (Treatment C), and no humidity with no wind
(Treatment B, the experimental control). The second independent variable is time.
28. B. Water loss at different times is represented by the vertical distance from the x-axis. The rate of water loss, or
the amount of water lost per unit of time, is represented by the slope of the line connecting the data
points. The slope for a straight line is given by
  , or the change in a y distance divided by accompanying change in the x distanc
