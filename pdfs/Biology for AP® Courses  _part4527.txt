il its resources
become depleted. At that point, the population
growth rate will slow down and level off to zero.
b.
The population shows exponential growth, as the
number of individuals doubles every month and
will likely grow logistically in the future when
the resources become limited. At that point, the
population growth rate will slow down and level
off to zero.
c.
The population shows exponential growth, as
number of individuals doubles every month and
will likely continue to grow exponentially until
its resources become limited. At that point, the
growth will become logistic; the population
growth rate will slow down and level off to zero.
d.
The population shows logistic growth and is
likely to grow exponentially as the resources are
probably increasing. The population growth rate
will increase in the future as well.
61. Explain how climate change might lead to a decrease
in one populationâ€™s carrying capacity and an increase in
the carrying capacity of a different population.
