Figure 20.16 Three alternate hypotheses of eukaryotic and prokaryotic evolution are (a) the nucleus-first hypothesis,
(b) the mitochondrion-first hypothesis, and (c) the eukaryote-first hypothesis.
Web and Network Models
The recognition of the importance of HGT, especially in the evolution of prokaryotes, has caused some to propose
abandoning the classic “tree of life” model. In 1999, W. Ford Doolittle proposed a phylogenetic model that resembles a
web or a network more than a tree. The hypothesis is that eukaryotes evolved not from a single prokaryotic ancestor, but
from a pool of many species that were sharing genes by HGT mechanisms. As shown in Figure 20.17a, some individual
prokaryotes were responsible for transferring the bacteria that caused mitochondrial development to the new eukaryotes,
whereas other species transferred the bacteria that gave rise to chloroplasts. This model is often called the “
