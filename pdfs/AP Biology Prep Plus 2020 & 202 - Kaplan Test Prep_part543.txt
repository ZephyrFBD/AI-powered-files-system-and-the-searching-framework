ctions from nucleus
to ribosomes
tRNA: transfer RNA; brings amino acids to ribosomes for
translation
rRNA: ribosomal RNA; structural component of ribosomes
hnRNA: heterogeneous nuclear RNA; synthesized from a DNA
template by transcription—sometimes called pre-mRNA
RNAi: RNA interference; when small segments of RNA bind to
specific mRNA to block gene expression
DNA Replication
It is important to understand that the strands of the DNA double helix are
oriented in an antiparallel manner to each other—with one strand 5′ to 3′
and the other side 3′ to 5′. The 3′ to 5′ designations refer to the carbons
that make up the sugar in each nucleotide, and the nucleotides of each
strand are connected by hydrogen bonds to a nucleotide in the
complementary strand. DNA polymerase II adds from the 5′ end of the
incoming nucleotide to the 3′ position of the ribose in the last nucleotide
on the DNA strand being synthesized. However, DNA polymerase cannot
bind until an RNA primer, a short strand of complem
