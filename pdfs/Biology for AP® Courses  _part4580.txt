 nests, a scolding call that a single bird
makes to scold a predator bird perched nearby, and a
warning call that a single bird makes to warn other birds
when a predator bird flies into the vicinity. A table was
created to summarize the data from this analysis and also
show the range of sound frequencies audible to the prey
and predator species. Explain how these data support the
claim that communication of information affects natural
selection in the small bird species.

A scolding call made by small birds can be
