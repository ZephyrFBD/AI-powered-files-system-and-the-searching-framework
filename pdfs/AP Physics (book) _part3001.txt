g. 27–4. His theory, still accepted today, made a new and
radical assumption: that the energy of the oscillations of atoms within molecules
cannot have just any value; instead each has energy which is a multiple of a mini-
mum value related to the frequency of oscillation by
Here h is a new constant, now called Planck’s constant, whose value was
estimated by Planck by fitting his formula for the blackbody radiation curve to
experiment. The value accepted today is
Planck’s assumption suggests that the energy of any molecular vibration could be
only a whole number multiple of hf:

where n is called a quantum number (“quantum” means “discrete amount” as
opposed to “continuous”). This idea is often called Planck’s quantum hypothesis,
although little attention was brought to this point at the time. In fact, it appears
that Planck considered it more as a mathematical device to get the “right answer”
rather than as an important discovery. Planck himself continued to seek a classical
