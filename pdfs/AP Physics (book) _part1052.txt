 has magnitude equal to the weight of the object. For example,
a log whose specific gravity is 0.60 and whose volume is 
has a mass
If the log is fully submerged, it will displace a mass of water
Hence the buoyant force on the log will be greater than its weight, and it will
float upward to the surface (Fig. 10–14). The log will come to equilibrium 
when it displaces 1200 kg of water, which means that 
of its volume 
will be submerged. This 
corresponds to 60% of the volume of the log
so 60% of the log is submerged.
In general when an object floats, we have
which we can write as
(see Fig. 10–15)
where 
is the full volume of the object and 
is the volume of fluid it 
displaces (
volume submerged). Thus
That is, the fraction of the object submerged is given by the ratio of the object’s
density to that of the fluid. If the fluid is water, this fraction equals the specific
gravity of the object.
