group of birds is flying south during their yearly migration when a hurricane with extremely strong winds
occurs. Only 10% of the group survive the storm, reaching their winter nesting site and reproducing the next
spring. This type of event is an example of
(A) the bottleneck effect because only the fittest members of the population survived.
(B) the bottleneck effect because the population size was rapidly reduced.
(C) the founder effect because the group of birds from before the storm were not genetically diverse.
(D) the founder effect because the birds colonized a new habitat and never migrated again back to their
original habitat.
3. Which of the following best explains the conditions under which the founder effect occurs?
(A) Random evolutionary change happens over multiple generations, causing a large population to separate
into two smaller, genetically different populations.
(B) A populationâ€™s size is rapidly reduced, and the genetic diversity of the surviving population is no
