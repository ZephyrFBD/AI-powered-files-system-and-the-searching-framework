Again, the two bonds are identical, and the bond dipoles are equal in magnitude. Because

The molecule O “ C “ S is linear and has a Lewis structure analogous to that  
of CO2. Would you expect this molecule to be nonpolar?

Predict whether these molecules are polar or nonpolar: (a) BrCl, (b) SO2, (c) SF6.
Sample Exercise 9.4 
Polarity of Molecules
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given three molecular formulas and asked to  
predict whether the molecules are polar.
Plan A molecule containing only two atoms is polar if the atoms 
differ in electronegativity. The polarity of a molecule containing 
three or more atoms depends on both the molecular geometry 
and the individual bond polar
