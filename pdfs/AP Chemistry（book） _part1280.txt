SOLUTION
Bromine (group 7A) has seven valence electrons, and oxygen 
(group 6A) has six. We must add one more electron to our sum to 
account for the 1- charge of the ion. The total number of valence 
electrons is, therefore, 7 + 13 * 62 + 1 = 26. For oxyanions—

, and so forth—the oxygen atoms surround 
the central nonmetal atom. After arranging the O atoms around 
the Br atom, drawing single bonds, and distributing the unshared 
electron pairs, we have
