longer depending on the antenna charges.
The fields not far from the antenna, referred to as the near field, become
quite complicated, but we are not so interested in them. We are mainly interested
in the fields far from the antenna (they are generally what we detect), which we
refer to as the radiation field. The electric field lines form loops, as shown in
Fig.22–6a, and continue moving outward. The magnetic field lines also form closed
loops, but are not shown because they are perpendicular to the page. Although the
lines are shown only on the right of the source, fields also travel in other directions.
The field strengths are greatest in directions perpendicular to the oscillating
charges; and they drop to zero along the direction of oscillation—above and below
the antenna in Fig. 22–6a.

†We are considering waves traveling through empty space. There are no charges for lines of 
to start
or stop on, so they form closed loops. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops
