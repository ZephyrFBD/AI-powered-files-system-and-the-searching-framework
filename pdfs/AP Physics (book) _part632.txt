microscopic world
of the atom, the law of conservation of energy has been found to hold in every
experimental situation so far tested.

Work-Energy versus Energy Conservation
The law of conservation of energy is more general and more powerful than the
work-energy principle. Indeed, the work-energy principle should not be viewed
as a statement of conservation of energy. It is nonetheless useful for mechanical
problems; and whether you use it, or use the more powerful conservation of
energy, can depend on your choice of the system under study. If you choose as
your system a particle or rigid object on which external forces do work, then you
can use the work-energy principle: the work done by the external forces on your
object equals the change in its kinetic energy.
On the other hand, if you choose a system on which no external forces do
work, then you need to apply conservation of energy to that system directly.
Consider, for example, a spring connected to
