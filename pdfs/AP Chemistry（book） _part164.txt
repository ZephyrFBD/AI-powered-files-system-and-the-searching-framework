has a higher density than air—1 kg of air 
has the same mass as 1 kg of iron, but the iron occupies a smaller volume, thereby giving 
it a higher density. If we combine two liquids that do not mix, the less dense liquid will 
float on the denser liquid.
Units of Energy
The SI unit for energy is the joule (pronounced “jool”), J, in honor of James Joule (1818−1889), 
a British scientist who investigated work and heat. If we return to Equation 1.2 where kinetic 
energy was defined, we immediately see that joules are a derived unit, 1 J = 1 kg-m2/s2. 
 
Numerically, a 2-kg mass moving at a velocity of 1 m/s possesses a kinetic energy of 1 J:
Ek = 1
2 mv2 = 1
2 (2 kg) (1 m>s)2 = 1 kg@m2>s2 = 1 J
