protein X and the gene for protein X are in diﬀerent vectors, no or
little transcription will occur. Hence, the correct answer is (D). (A) is
incorrect because although, the promoter is present and polymerase II
could attach to the DNA, the interaction must be stabilized by a
transcription complex that requires the enhancer region to be located
upstream or downstream. (B) is incorrect because cells in culture are
able to transcribe foreign DNA (the structure of DNA is universal). (C) is
incorrect because the cells will not transcribe mRNA if the
transcription complex does not form.
