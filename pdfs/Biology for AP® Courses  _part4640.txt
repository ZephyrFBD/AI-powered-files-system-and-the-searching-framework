major disadvantage in terms of NPE. Therefore, many endotherms have to eat more often than
ectotherms to get the energy they need for survival. In general, NPE for ectotherms is an order of magnitude (10x) higher
than for endotherms. For example, the NPE for a caterpillar eating leaves has been measured at 18 percent, whereas the
NPE for a squirrel eating acorns may be as low as 1.6 percent.
The inefficiency of energy use by warm-blooded animals has broad implications for the world's food supply. It is widely
accepted that the meat industry uses large amounts of crops to feed livestock, and because the NPE is low, much of the
energy from animal feed is lost. For example, it costs about $0.01 to produce 1000 dietary calories (kcal) of corn or
soybeans, but approximately $0.19 to produce a similar number of calories growing cattle for beef consumption. The same
energy content of milk from cattle is also costly, at approximately $0.16 per 1000 kcal. Much of this difference is due to
the l
