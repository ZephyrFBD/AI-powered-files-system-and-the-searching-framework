decays per second correspond to 4 pCi, then Eq. 30–3b to determine how 
many nuclei of radon it takes to have this activity

(b) From Eqs. 30–3b and 30–6
Appendix B tells us
for radon, so
The molar mass (222 u) and Avogadro’s number are used to find the mass:

grams of radon per m3 of air.
NOTE Each radon atom emits 4 
particles and 4 
particles, each one capable
of causing many harmful ionizations, before the sequence of decays reaches a
stable element.

1–6 Radiation Therapy
The medical application of radioactivity and radiation to human beings involves
two basic aspects: (1) radiation therapy—the treatment of disease (mainly
cancer)—which we discuss in this Section; and (2) the diagnosis of disease, which
we discuss in the following Sections of this Chapter.
Radiation can cause cancer. It can also be
