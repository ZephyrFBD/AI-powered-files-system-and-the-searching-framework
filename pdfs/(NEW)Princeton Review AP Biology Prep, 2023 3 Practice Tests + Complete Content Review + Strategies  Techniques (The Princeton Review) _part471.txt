n. A low standard deviation means the data points are all
similar and close to the mean, while a high standard deviation means the data are more spread out. Here is the
relationship between a normal distribution and standard deviation (SD).
This means that about 70 percent of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean in a normally distributed
dataset. Standard error (SE) can also be used to report how much a given dataset varies and is calculated by
dividing the standard deviation by the square root of the sample size.
Nonparametric Data
Nonparametric data often includes large outliers and do not fit a normal distribution. In order to determine if data
is parametric or not, you can construct a histogram, or frequency diagram. These graphs give information on the
spread of the data and the central tendencies. Making a histogram is like setting up bins, or intervals with the same
range, that cover the entire dataset (the x-axis). The measurements in each bin are graphed on th
