ber can be constructed from easily obtainable items, such as plastic Petri dishes, plastic bottles, or
graduated cylinders. An example of a choice chamber is shown in Figure 24.13.
Figure 24.13 Choice Chamber
Drosophila are placed in the middle of the choice chamber, and different environmental conditions are created at
each end of the chamber. Several conditions can be created with common classroom materials:
Light and dark—cover one half of the choice chamber with foil or black paper
Food preference—soak the cotton balls in different fruit juices and place them at opposite ends of the choice
chamber
Temperature—place one side of the choice chamber on an ice pack
As with all lab investigations, it is important to use appropriate controls and repeat the experiment multiple times
in order to obtain the most reliable data.
After a period of time (usually at least 10 minutes), the number of Drosophila on each side of the choice chamber
are recorded. The null hypothesis for the experiment
