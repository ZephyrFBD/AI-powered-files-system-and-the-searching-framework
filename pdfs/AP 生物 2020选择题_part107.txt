n population size as a result of hunting 
likely caused a decrease in genetic diversity. This is an example of a 
genetic bottleneck.
(D) 
Incorrect. The founder effect describes the low genetic diversity that is 
found in populations that grow from a few migrated individuals and not 
as a result of rapid population decline.

(A) 
Incorrect. This option correctly describes one effect of a density-
dependent factor, but algal blooms are a density-independent, not a 
density-dependent, factor that negatively affects otter populations.
