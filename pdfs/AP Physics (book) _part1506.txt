 is often used inconsistently, so it is important for us to define heat clearly,
and to clarify the phenomena and concepts related to heat.
We commonly speak of the flow of heat—heat flows from a stove burner to a
pot of soup, from the Sun to the Earth, from a person’s mouth into a fever ther-
mometer. Heat flows spontaneously from an object at higher temperature to one
at lower temperature. Indeed, an eighteenth-century model of heat pictured heat
flow as movement of a fluid substance called caloric. However, the caloric fluid
could never be detected. In the nineteenth century, it was found that the various
phenomena associated with heat could be described consistently using a new
model that views heat as being akin to work, as we will discuss in a moment. First
we note that a common unit for heat, still in use today, is named after caloric. It is
called the calorie (cal) and is defined as the amount of heat necessary to raise the
temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 Celsius degree. [T
