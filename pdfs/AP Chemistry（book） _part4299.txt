um. 
The equilibrium constant is most usually denoted by Kp for gas-
phase systems or Kc for solution-phase systems. (Section 15.2)
equilibrium-constant expression The expression that describes 
the relationship among the concentrations (or partial pressures) 
of the substances present in a system at equilibrium. The 
numerator is obtained by multiplying the concentrations of 
the substances on the product side of the equation, each raised 
to a power equal to its coefficient in the chemical equation. 
The denominator similarly contains the concentrations of the 
substances on the reactant side of the equation. (Section 15.2)
equivalence point The point in a titration at which the added 
solute reacts completely with the solute present in the solution. 
(Section 4.6)
ester An organic compound that has an OR group attached to 
a carbonyl; it is the product of a reaction between a carboxylic 
acid and an alcohol. (Section 24.4)
ether A compound in which two hydrocarbon groups are 
bonded
