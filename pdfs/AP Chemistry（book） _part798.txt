 principle, free of the 
polluting emissions that are a major problem with fossil fuels. However, nuclear power 
plants produce radioactive waste products, and their use has therefore been controver-
sial. We will discuss issues related to the production of nuclear energy in Chapter 21.
Fossil fuels and nuclear energy are nonrenewable sources of energyâ€”they are lim-
ited resources that we are consuming at a much greater rate than they can be regener-
ated. Eventually these fuels will be expended, although estimates vary greatly as to 
when this will occur. Because nonrenewable energy sources will eventually be used up, a 
great deal of research is being conducted on renewable energy sources, sources that are 
essentially inexhaustible. Renewable energy sources include solar energy from the Sun, wind 
energy harnessed by windmills, geothermal energy from the heat stored inside Earth, hydroelec-
tric energy from flowing rivers, and biomass energy from crops and biological waste matter.
