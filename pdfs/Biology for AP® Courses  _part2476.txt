ine, and is also present
in several vitamins and coenzymes. Other important macronutrients are potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca),
and sodium (Na). Although these elements are required in smaller amounts, they are very important for the structure and
function of the prokaryotic cell.
Micronutrients
In addition to these macronutrients, prokaryotes require various metallic elements in small amounts. These are referred
to as micronutrients or trace elements. For example, iron is necessary for the function of the cytochromes involved in
electron-transport reactions. Some prokaryotes require other elements—such as boron (B), chromium (Cr), and manganese
(Mn)—primarily as enzyme cofactors.
The Ways in Which Prokaryotes Obtain Energy
Prokaryotes can use different sources of energy to assemble macromolecules from smaller molecules. Phototrophs
(or phototrophic organisms) obtain their energy from sunlight. Chemotrophs (or chemosynthetic organisms) obtain
their energy from chemical comp
