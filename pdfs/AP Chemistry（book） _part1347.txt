 
CaH2, 2410 kJ/mol; SrH2, 2250 kJ/mol; BaH2, 2121 kJ/mol.  
(a) What is the oxidation number of H in these compounds? 
(b) Assuming that all of these compounds have the same 
three-dimensional arrangement of ions in the solid, which 
of these compounds has the shortest cationâ€“anion dis-
tance? (c) Consider BeH2. Does it require 3205 kJ of energy 
to break one mole of the solid into its ions, or does breaking 
up one mole of solid into its ions release 3205 kJ of energy? 
(d) The lattice energy of ZnH2 is 2870 kJ/mol. Considering 
the trend in lattice enthalpies in the Group 2A compounds, 
predict which Group 2A element is most similar in ionic ra-
dius to the Zn2+ ion.
 8.80 Based on data in Table 8.1, estimate (within 30 kJ>mol) the 
lattice energy for (a) LiBr, (b) CsBr, (c) CaCl2.
 8.81 An ionic substance of formula MX has a lattice energy of 
6 * 103 kJ>mol. Is the charge on the ion M likely to be 
1+, 2+, or 3+? Explain.
