extremes or reduced food and water availability. Changes in energy also
cause disruptions at the population level by aﬀecting population size and
number.
AP EXPERT NOTE
The most important energy transformations in organisms are
found in the processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration,
discussed in chapter 10 of this book. At a larger scale, energy
transformations can also be studied at the ecosystem or biome
level—see chapter 19 for more on this ecological perspective.
Coupled Reactions and
Chemiosmosis
A coupled reaction is one in which transport across a membrane is
coupled with a chemical reaction. Of all the things to remember here,
there is one that is particularly important: chemiosmosis is used by cells
to generate ATP by moving H+ ions across a membrane, down a
concentration gradient, as shown in the figure on the following page.
Special membrane proteins called ATPases create proton channels to
convert ADP to ATP when a proton passes through. Aerobic respiration
