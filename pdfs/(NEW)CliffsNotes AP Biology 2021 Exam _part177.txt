ons is used to bond a phosphate group to ADP, making it ATP (adenosine
triphosphate). The process is called phosphorylation, and the result is that energy (originally from light) from the
two electrons is trapped in an ATP molecule. The cycle is completed when the two electrons return to the
photosystem pigments.
Noncyclic photophosphorylation is a more advanced system involving both
 
photosystems I and II. It begins when chlorophyll P680in photosystem II
traps photon energy and energizes two electrons. These two electrons are passed to a primary electron acceptor, then
through an electron transport chain, producing, on average, 1.5 ATP and are then finally returned to photosystem I.
Here the electrons are energized again (by light) and are received by another primary electron acceptor. These two
electrons then
combine with 2 H+ to form NADPH.
 
Meanwhile, a water molecule is split producing 2 electrons, 2 H+, and
 
Â½O2. The 2 electrons replace the electrons energized from photosystem
