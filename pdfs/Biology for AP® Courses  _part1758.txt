fault whereas the lac operon
is repressible and is OFF by default.
b.
The trp operon synthesizes tryptophan which is essential for the cell and therefore remains ON, whereas the
lac operon synthesizes enzymes for the breakdown of a sugar that is not always available and remains OFF
by default.
c.
The trp operon is constitutive and remains ON by default, whereas the lac operon is repressible and therefore
is OFF by default.
d.
The lac operon undergoes transcriptional attenuation and therefore is OFF by default, whereas the trp operon
is not regulated by any such mechanism and is ON by default.
If glucose is absent, then CAP can bind to the operator sequence to activate transcription. If lactose is absent, then the
repressor binds to the operator to prevent transcription. If either of these requirements is met, then transcription remains off.

Only when both conditions are satisfied is the lac operon transcribed (Table 16.2).
