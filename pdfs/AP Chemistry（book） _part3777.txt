electron, whereas 
3Fe(NCS)643- has five unpaired electrons. From these results, 
what can you conclude about whether each complex is high 
spin or low spin? What can you say about the placement of 
NCS- in the spectrochemical series?

 23.67  The Curie temperature is the temperature at which a fer-
romagnetic solid switches from ferromagnetic to para-
magnetic, and for nickel, the Curie temperature is 354 Â°C. 
Knowing this, you tie a string to two paper clips made of 
nickel and hold the paper clips near a permanent magnet. 
The magnet attracts the paper clips, as shown in the photo-
graph on the left. Now you heat one of the paper clips with 
a cigarette lighter, and the clip drops (right photograph). 
Explain what happened.
