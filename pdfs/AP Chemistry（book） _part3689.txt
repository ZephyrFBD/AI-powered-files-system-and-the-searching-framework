r. Microorganisms have adapted to this problem by secreting an 
iron-binding compound, called a siderophore, that forms an extreme-
ly stable water-soluble complex with iron(III). One such complex is 
ferrichrome (Figure 23.17). The iron-binding strength of a siderophore 
is so great that it can extract iron from iron oxides.
When ferrichrome enters a living cell, the iron it carries is 
removed through an enzyme-catalyzed reaction that reduces the 
strongly bonding iron(III) to iron(II), which is only weakly com-
plexed by the siderophore (Figure 23.18). Microorganisms thus 
acquire iron by excreting a siderophore into their immediate envi-
ronment and then taking the resulting iron complex into the cell.
In humans, iron is assimilated from food in the intestine. A pro-
tein called transferrin binds iron and transports it across the intesti-
nal wall to distribute it to other tissues in the body. The normal adult 
body contains about 4 g of iron. At any one time, about 3 g of this
