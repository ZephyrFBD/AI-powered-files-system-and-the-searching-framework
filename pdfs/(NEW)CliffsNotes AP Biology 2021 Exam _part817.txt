l. You manipulated the variable (gave the variable different values) by changing the
kind of chemical stimulus. Be sure to include the following in your experimental design:
1. One or more experimental treatments (different values for your independent variable); some independent
variables you can consider include the following:
Physical stimuli such as humidity, temperature, light, sound, gravity, pH, and chemicals (salt, drugs, nicotine,
alcohol, caffeine, aspirin, and pesticides).
Biotic stimuli such as the introduction of members of the same species (males or females) or other species (predators
or prey). If members of the same species are introduced, the sex of the introduced individual may influence behavior
(mating or agonistic behaviors). Multiple members of the same species may elicit social behaviors.
2. A control treatment to which the experimental treatments can be compared.
3. A graph, histogram, or other graphic representation of the data.
4. An interpretation or discussio
