ion of illness,
was not caused by anything in the snot because they saw the same
destructive eﬀect when the snot was not even used … the cytopathic,
i.e., cell-killing, changes come from the process of the culture itself,
not from any virus in any snot, period.’ Enders quotes in his 1957
paper a virologist called Ruckle as reporting similar ﬁndings ‘and in
addition has isolated an agent from monkey kidney tissue that is so
far indistinguishable from human measles virus’. In other words,
Cowan says, these particles called ‘measles viruses’ are simply and
clearly breakdown products of the starved and poisoned tissue. For
measles ‘virus’ see all ‘viruses’ including the so-called ‘Covid virus’.
Enders, the ‘Father of Modern Vaccines’, also said:
There is a potential risk in employing cultures of primate cells for the production of vaccines
composed of attenuated virus, since the presence of other agents possibly latent in primate
tissues cannot be definitely excluded by any known method.
