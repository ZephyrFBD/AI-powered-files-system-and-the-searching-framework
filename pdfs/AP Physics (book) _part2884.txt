plate numbers. Assuming it is necessary to resolve points
separated by 5 cm with 550-nm light, and that the satellite
orbits at a height of 130 km, what minimum lens aperture
(diameter) is required?
88. Given two 12-cm-focal-length lenses, you attempt to make
a crude microscope using them. While holding these lenses
a distance 55 cm apart, you position your microscope so
that its objective lens is distance 
from a small object.
Assume your eye’s near point 
(a) For your micro-
scope to function properly, what should 
be? (b)Assuming
your eye is relaxed when using it, what magnification M
does your microscope achieve? (c) Since the length of your
microscope is not much greater than the focal lengths of its
lenses, the approximation 
is not valid. If you
apply this approximation to your microscope, what % error
do you make in your microscope’s true magnification?
