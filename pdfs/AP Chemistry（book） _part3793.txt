the concentrations of Mg2+ and 
Ca2+ in the hard water in mg>L.
 23.99  Carbon monoxide is toxic because it binds more strongly to 
the iron in hemoglobin (Hb) than does O2, as indicated by 
these approximate standard free-energy changes in blood:
Hb + O2 ¡  HbO2   ∆G° = -70 kJ
Hb + CO ¡  HbCO  ∆G° = -80 kJ
Using these data, estimate the equilibrium constant at 298 
K for the equilibrium
HbO2 + CO ∆ HbCO + O2
 23.100  The value of ∆ for the 3CrF643- complex is 182 kJ>mol. 
Calculate the expected wavelength of the absorption cor-
responding to promotion of an electron from the lower- 
energy to the higher-energy d-orbital set in this complex. 
Should the complex absorb in the visible range?

A Cu electrode is immersed in a solution that is 1.00 M 
in 3Cu(NH3)442+ and 1.00 M in NH3. When the cathode 
is a standard hydrogen electrode, the emf of the cell is 
found to be +0.08 V. What is the formation constant for 
3Cu(NH3)442+?
