a series of 
 
mathematical functions called wave functions that describe the electron in the atom. 
These wave functions are usually represented by the symbol c (lowercase Greek letter psi). 
 
Although the wave function has no direct physical meaning, the square of the wave 
function, c2, provides information about the electron’s location when it is in an  
allowed 
energy state.
For the hydrogen atom, the allowed energies are the same as those predicted by the 
Bohr model. However, the Bohr model assumes that the electron is in a circular orbit of 
some particular radius about the nucleus. In the quantum-mechanical model, the elec-
tron’s location cannot be described so simply.
According to the uncertainty principle, if we know the momentum of the elec-
tron with high accuracy, our simultaneous knowledge of its location is very uncer-
tain. Thus, we cannot hope to specify the exact location of an individual electron 
around the nucleus. Rather, we must be content with a kind of stat
