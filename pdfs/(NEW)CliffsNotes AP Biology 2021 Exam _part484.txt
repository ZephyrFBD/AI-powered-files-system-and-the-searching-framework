 The tissue
consists mostly of cells that form fluid-conducting columns, but, unlike the passive cell walls of remnant xylem
cells, phloem cells are active, living cells. Pores on the end walls of phloem cells allow for the movement of organic
materials between cells.
Water movement through xylem is explained by cohesion-tension theory. The major concepts of this theory
involve transpiration, adhesion, cohesion, and tension (TACT) as follows:
Transpiration, the evaporation of water from plants, removes water from leaves.
Adhesion of water to the walls of xylem cells helps to prevent water in xylem cells from slipping down under the
pull of gravity. Adhesion is the molecular attraction between unlike substances. Because water is a polar covalent
molecule, its poles form hydrogen bonds with any adjacent polar substance, in this case, the walls of the xylem cells.
Cohesion between water molecules produces a single, polymerlike column of water from roots to leaves. Cohesion
is the molecula
