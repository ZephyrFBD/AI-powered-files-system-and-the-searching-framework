1C6H5Cl2 boils at 131.8 °C. Use 
Trouton’s rule to estimate ∆Hvap for this substance.
 19.104  In chemical kinetics, the entropy of activation is the entropy 
change for the process in which the reactants reach the 
activated complex. Predict whether the entropy of acti-
vation for a bimolecular process is usually positive or 
negative.
 19.105  At what temperatures is the following reaction, the 
reduction of magnetite by graphite to elemental iron, 
spontaneous?
Fe3O41s2 + 2 C1s, graphite2 ¡ 2 CO21g2 + 3 Fe1s2
 19.106  The following processes were all discussed in Chapter 18, 
“Chemistry of the Environment.” Estimate whether the 
entropy of the system increases or decreases during each 
process: (a) photodissociation of O21g2, (b) formation of 
ozone from oxygen molecules and oxygen atoms, (c) dif-
fusion of CFCs into the stratosphere, (d) desalination of 
water by reverse osmosis.
