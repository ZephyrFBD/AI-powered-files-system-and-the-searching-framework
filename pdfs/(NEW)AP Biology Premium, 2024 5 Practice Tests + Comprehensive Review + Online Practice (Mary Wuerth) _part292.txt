use independent assortment is the
independent alignment of pairs of homologous chromosomes in metaphase I; this does not affect the number of
chromosomes found in a cell. Choice (D) is incorrect because genetic recombination describes the exchange of
genetic material between chromosomes; this would not result in the presence of three copies of a chromosome.
Short Free-Response
11. (a)
(b) B and C have the lowest recombination frequency at 15%, so they must be the closest together of the three
genes. A and C have a recombination frequency of 30%, and A and B have a recombination frequency of
45%, so A must be closer to C than A is to B. So the correct placement of the three genes on the
chromosome must be as shown in part (a).
(c)
(d) If a crossover event occurred between genes N and O as shown in the following figure, the resulting gametes
would have the genotypes MNop and mnOP.
12. (a) At the end of meiosis II, one would expect to find three chromosomes in each gamete.
(b) Meiosis sta
