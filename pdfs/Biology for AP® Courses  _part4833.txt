overestimates rates of extinction. The rate of
habitat destruction calculation method uses
species-area curves, but underestimates the rate
of extinction.
c.
The rate of habitat destruction calculation
method should be adopted. The extinction rates
calculation method is based on a large number of
observations and measurements but
overestimates rates of extinction. The rate of
habitat destruction calculation method uses
species-area curves, but underestimates the rate
of extinction.
d.
Extinction rates are calculated based on the
recorded extinction of species in the past 500
years using data from a large number of
observations and measurements. They do not
take into account unobserved extinctions and
undiscovered species. In this way, the method
underestimates rates of extinction. The second
method based on the amount of habitat
destruction and on species-area curves is more
adapted to this situation, although it is not based
on existing data and is likely to overestimate the
rate of
