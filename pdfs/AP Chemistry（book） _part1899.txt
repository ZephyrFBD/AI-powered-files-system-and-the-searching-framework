 unit 
cell is not shared. A cube has 12 edges, so the total number of 
rubidium ions is 12 11
42 + 1 = 4. This answer makes sense be-
cause the number of Rb+ ions must be the same as the number 
of I- ions to maintain charge balance.
(c) In ionic compounds, cations and anions touch each other. In 
RbI the cations and anions touch along the edge of the unit 
cell as shown in the following ﬁgure.
rI–
2rRb+
rI–
The length of the unit cell edge is equal to r1I-2 + 2r1Rb+2 + r1I-2 =  
2r1I-2 + 2r1Rb+2. Plugging in the ionic radii we get 212.06 Å2 +
211.66 Å2 = 7.44 Å. The volume of a cubic unit cell is just the edge 
length cubed. Converting from Å to cm and cubing we get
Volume = 17.44 * 10-8 cm23 = 4.12 * 10-22 cm3.
From parts (a) and (b) we know that there are four rubidium and 
four iodide ions per unit cell. Using this result and the molar 
masses, we can calculate the mass per unit cell
Mass =
4185.47 g>mol2 + 41126.90 g>mol2
6.022 * 1023 mol-1
= 1.411 * 10-21 g
The density is the ma
