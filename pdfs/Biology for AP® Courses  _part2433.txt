ls outnumber human body cells by about ten to one.
They comprise the majority of living things in all ecosystems. Some prokaryotes thrive in environments that are inhospitable
for most living things. Prokaryotes recycle nutrients—essential substances (such as carbon and nitrogen)—and they drive
the evolution of new ecosystems, some of which are natural and others man-made. Prokaryotes have been on Earth since
long before multicellular life appeared.
Prokaryotes, the First Inhabitants of Earth
When and where did life begin? What were the conditions on Earth when life began? Prokaryotes were the first forms of life
on Earth, and they existed for billions of years before plants and animals appeared. The Earth and its moon are thought to be
about 4.54 billion years old. This estimate is based on evidence from radiometric dating of meteorite material together with
other substrate material from Earth and the moon. Early Earth had a very different atmosphere (contained less molecular
oxygen)
