 7.29  Which neutral atom is isoelectronic with each of the follow-
ing ions? Ga3+, Zr4+, Mn7+, I-, Pb2+.
 7.30  Some ions do not have a corresponding neutral atom that has 
the same electron conﬁguration. For each of the following 
ions, identify the neutral atom that has the same number of 
electrons and determine if this atom has the same electron 
conﬁguration. (a) Cl-, (b) Sc3 +, (c) Fe2 +, (d) Zn2 +, (e) Sn4 +.
 7.31  Consider the isoelectronic ions F- and Na+. (a) Which ion is 
smaller? (b) Using Equation 7.1 and assuming that core elec-
trons contribute 1.00 and valence electrons contribute 0.00 
to the screening constant, S, calculate Zeff for the 2p electrons 
in both ions. (c) Repeat this calculation using Slater’s rules to 
estimate the screening constant, S. (d) For isoelectronic ions, 
how are effective nuclear charge and ionic radius related?
 7.32  Consider the isoelectronic ions Cl- and K+. (a) Wh
