y micrometer, is 296. What 
is the thickness of the foil? The wavelength of light used is
589 nm.
*59. (III) One of the beams of an interferometer (Fig. 24–61)
passes through a small evacuated glass container 1.155 cm
deep. When a gas is allowed to slowly fill the container,
a total of 158 dark fringes are counted to move past a 
reference line. The light used has a wavelength of 632.8 nm.
Calculate the index of refraction of the gas at its final 
density, assuming that the interferometer is in vacuum.

63. (II) Two polarizers are oriented at 42.0° to one another.
Light polarized at a 21.0° angle to each polarizer passes
through both. What is the transmitted intensity (%)?
64. (II) Three perfectly polarizing sheets are spaced 2 cm apart
and in parallel planes. The transmission axis of the second
sheet is 30° relative to the first one. The transmission axis of
