entrations in aqueous solutions.
 16.4 ▶  The ph Scale Use the pH scale to 
describe the acidity or basicity of an 
aqueous solution. Neutral solutions have  
pH = 7, acidic solutions have pH below 7, 
and basic solutions have pH above 7.
 
16.5 ▶  Strong Acids and Bases Categorize 
acids and bases as being either strong or weak 
electrolytes. Strong acids and bases are strong 
electrolytes, ionizing or dissociating completely 
in aqueous solution. Weak acids and bases are 
weak electrolytes and ionize only partially.
 16.6 ▶  Weak Acids Learn that the ionization 
of a weak acid in water is an equilibrium 
process with an equilibrium constant Ka and 
be able to use it to calculate the pH of a 
weak acid solution.
 
16.7 ▶  Weak Bases Learn that the ionization of a 
weak base in water is an equilibrium process 
with equilibrium constant Kb that can be used 
to calculate the pH of a weak base solution.
 
16.8 ▶  Relationship Between Ka and Kb  
Recognize that Ka and Kb are related by the
