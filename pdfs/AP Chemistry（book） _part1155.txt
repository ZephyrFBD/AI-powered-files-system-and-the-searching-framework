 the first noble-gas 
compound by combining Xe with the fluorine-containing compound PtF6. Xenon also 
reacts directly with F21g2 to form the molecular compounds XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6. Kryp-
ton has a higher I1 value than xenon and is therefore less reactive. In fact, only a single 
stable compound of krypton is known, KrF2. In 2000, Finnish scientists reported the first 
neutral molecule that contains argon, the HArF molecule, which is stable only at low 
temperatures.
