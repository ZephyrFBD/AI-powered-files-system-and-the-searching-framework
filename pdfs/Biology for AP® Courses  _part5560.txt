ny contends, and she says that lungs can be adversely
aﬀected through varying degrees of pus and bleeding which
obviously aﬀects breathing and would be dubbed ‘Covid-19’. Even
more sinister was the impact of ‘antibodies’ on macrophages, a white
blood cell of the immune system. They consist of Type 1 and Type 2
which have very diﬀerent functions. She said Type 1 are ‘hyper-
vigilant’ white blood cells which ‘gobble up’ bacteria etc. However,
in doing so, this could cause inﬂammation and in extreme
circumstances be fatal. She says these aﬀects are mitigated by Type 2
macrophages which kick in to calm down the system and stop it
going rogue. They clear up dead tissue debris and reduce
inﬂammation that the Type 1 ‘ﬁre crews’ have caused. Type 1 kills
the infection and Type 2 heals the damage, she says. This is her
punchline with regard to ‘Covid vaccinations’: She says that mRNA
‘antibodies’ block Type 2 macrophages by aĴaching to them and
deactivating them. This meant that when the Type 1
