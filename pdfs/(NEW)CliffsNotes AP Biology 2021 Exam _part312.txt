 is the
summary of this process that begins with DNA to create a living, functioning organism.
DNA → RNA → proteins/enzymes → traits, metabolism, homeostasis
This flow of information is described as the central dogma of molecular biology. The underlying molecular
mechanisms for this process are the subject of this chapter.
The structure of DNA and RNA was presented earlier in Chapter 2, “Chemistry.” As a review, both DNA and RNA
are polymers of nucleotides. The nucleotide monomer consists of three covalently bonded parts—a nitrogen base, a
sugar, and a phosphate. Figure 9-1 reviews the differences in the structures of DNA and RNA and summarizes their
functions. Details of the functions of these molecules will be presented in this chapter.
Figure 9-1
Except for asexually reproducing organisms and identical twins, the DNA of every individual is different. These
differences, resulting from variations in the sequence of nucleotides, generate different RNA, which produce
different proteins.
