systematic names of aldehydes contain -al and ketone names contain -one. Notice 
that testosterone has both alcohol and ketone groups; the ketone functional group domi-
nates the molecular properties. Therefore, testosterone is considered a ketone first and an 
alcohol second, and its name reflects its ketone properties.
Many compounds found in nature contain an aldehyde or ketone functional group. 
Vanilla and cinnamon flavorings are naturally occurring aldehydes. Two isomers of the 
ketone carvone impart the characteristic flavors of spearmint leaves and caraway seeds.
Ketones are less reactive than aldehydes and are used extensively as solvents. Ace-
tone, the most widely used ketone, is completely miscible with water, yet it dissolves a 
wide range of organic substances.
Carboxylic Acids and esters
Carboxylic acids contain the carboxyl functional group, often written COOH. 
 (Sec-
tion 16.10) These weak acids are widely distributed in nature and are common in citrus 
fruits.
