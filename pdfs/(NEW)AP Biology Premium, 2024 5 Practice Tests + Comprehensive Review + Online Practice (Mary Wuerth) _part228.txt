ing cellular respiration.
10. (D) If electrons could not travel down the electron transport chain, a proton gradient would not be produced and
chemiosmosis could not occur. Choice (A) is incorrect because the production of pyruvate does not require the
electron transport chain. Choice (B) is incorrect because the ETC regenerates NAD+, not NADH. Limited
amounts of ATP are produced in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, so choice (C) is also incorrect.
Short Free-Response
11. (a) In aerobic cellular respiration, a cell’s supply of NAD+ is replenished during oxidative phosphorylation
(when NADH delivers its electrons to the electron transport chain).
(b) In anaerobic respiration, a cell’s supply of NAD+ is replenished during fermentation (when NADH donates
its electrons to a pyruvate molecule).
(c) If a cell’s supply of NAD+ ran out, the cell would not be able to undergo glycolysis.
(d) Glycolysis requires the input of NAD+; if there were no NAD+ available, glycolysis would halt. Living
