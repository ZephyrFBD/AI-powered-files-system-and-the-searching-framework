erested in determining
whether salamanders fall into this group performed the
following experiment. Long-toed salamanders were
captured from the wild. A few were injured and tissue
from their injuries was collected and ground up with water.
This solution was used to moisten a paper towel. Others
were not injured and placed on moistened paper towels for
48 hours. The moistened paper towels were placed at one
end of a rectangular box (stimulus end) and a paper towel
moistened with water was placed at the other end (control
end). In each test, a salamander was placed in the center
and the researchers observed the direction in which the
salamander moved. Multiple trials were performed using
paper towels moistened with chemicals from injured and
non-injured salamanders and the data was compiled into a
table. Which of the following statements is an accurate
analysis of the data?
a.
This salamander releases chemical compounds
during injury that elicit avoidance behavior in
