(a) Describe the most likely cause of the amino acid substitution in the sodium channel protein. Explain how the 
substitution of a single amino acid in the channel protein could cause pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes.
(b) Identify the dependent variable in the experiment whose data are graphed in Figure 2. Identify the positive 
control in the experiment. Justify exposing some mosquitoes to untreated filter paper each time the experiment was 
performed.
(c) Based on the data in Figure 2, describe whether mosquitoes from region A or from region B are more likely to 
exhibit greater evolutionary fitness if exposed to permethrin in their native environment over the time period of the 
experiment. Based on the data in Figu
