and reduced mental activity, among other symptoms. In children, hypothyroidism can cause cretinism, which can lead to
mental retardation and growth defects. Hyperthyroidism, the overproduction of thyroid hormones, can lead to an increased
metabolic rate and its effects: weight loss, excess heat production, sweating, and an increased heart rate. Gravesâ€™ disease is
one example of a hyperthyroid condition.
Hormonal Control of Blood Calcium Levels
Regulation of blood calcium concentrations is important for generation of muscle contractions and nerve impulses, which
are electrically stimulated. If calcium levels get too high, membrane permeability to sodium decreases and membranes
become less responsive. If calcium levels get too low, membrane permeability to sodium increases and convulsions or
muscle spasms can result.
Blood calcium levels are regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is produced by the parathyroid glands, as
illustrated in Figure 28.12. PTH is released in respon
