ane with 
six carbons? (b) What are the name and molecular formula of 
an  
alcohol derived from hexane?
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
These two compounds have “butane” in their name. Are they 
isomers?
SOLUTION
(a)  
Alkanes contain only carbon and hydrogen, and each carbon 
is attached to four other atoms. The name pentane contains 
the prefix penta- for five (Table 2.6), and we are told that the 
carbons are in a linear chain. If we then add enough hydrogen 
atoms to make four bonds to each carbon, we obtain the struc-
tural formula

This form of pentane is often called n-pentane, where the  
n- stands for “normal” because all five carbon atoms are in  
one line in the structural formula.
(b)  
Once the structural formula is written, we determine the 
molecular formula by counting the atoms present. Thus, 
n-pentane has the molecular formula C5H12.
