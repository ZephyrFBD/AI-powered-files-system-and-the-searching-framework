b. Paint a solid patch of clear nail polish on the leaf surface being studied. Make a 
patch of at least one square centimeter. 
c. Allow the nail polish to dry completely. 
d. Press a piece of clean, clear cellophane tape to the dried nail polish patch. Using 
clear (not opaque) tape is essential here. You might also try pulling the peel away 
from the leaf without using any tape and then preparing a wet mount of the peel 
with a drop of water and a cover slip. 
e. Gently peel the nail polish patch from the leaf by pulling a corner of the tape 
and peeling the nail polish off the leaf. This is the leaf impression that you will

leaf is going to be left on a live plant.)
