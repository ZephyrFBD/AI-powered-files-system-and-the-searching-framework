 glycosidic linkage, and the resulting sugar is called a
disaccharide. The disaccharide formed from two glucose molecules is maltose. Other common disaccharides include
sucrose (table sugar) and lactose (found in dairy products).
Now, what if you want to break up the disaccharide and form two monosaccharides again? Just add water.
Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides are made up of many repeated units of monosaccharides. Polysaccharides can consist of branched
or unbranched chains of monosaccharides. The most common polysaccharides you’ll need to know for the test are
starch, cellulose, and glycogen. Glycogen and starch are sugar storage molecules. Glycogen stores sugar in animals
and starch stores sugar in plants. Cellulose, on the other hand, is made up of β-glucose and is a major part of the cell
walls in plants. Its function is to lend structural support. Chitin, a polymer of β-glucose molecules, serves as a
structural molecule in the walls of fungus and in the exoskeletons of arthropod
