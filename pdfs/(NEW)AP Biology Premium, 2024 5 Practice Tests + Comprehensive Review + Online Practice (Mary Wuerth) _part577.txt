on and the F1 generation do not overlap, it is likely there
is a statistically significant difference in the number of trichomes per leaf between the parental and F1 generations.
If the 95% confidence intervals do overlap, the data are inconclusive, and it is not possible to say whether or not
there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups.
Lab 2: Hardy-Weinberg
If the allele frequencies in a population are changing, the population is likely evolving. Evolution can be studied in a
population by using mathematical models or computer simulations to observe changing allele frequencies in
populations.
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the Hardy-Weinberg equations describe the characteristics of a population that
is not evolving and has stable allele frequencies. A population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium if the following
five conditions are met:
1. Large population size
2. Random mating
3. No gene flow
4. No selection of any kind
5. No mutations
If a population is i
