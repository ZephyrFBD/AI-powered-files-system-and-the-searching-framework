CHAPTER 5 Thermochemistry
Bomb Calorimetry (Constant-Volume Calorimetry)
An important type of reaction studied using calorimetry is combustion, in which a 
compound reacts completely with excess oxygen. 
(Section 3.2) Combustion re-
actions are most accurately studied using a bomb calorimeter (Figure 5.19). The 
substance to be studied is placed in a small cup within an insulated sealed vessel 
called a bomb. The bomb, which is designed to withstand high pressures, has an in-
let valve for adding oxygen and electrical leads for initiating the reaction. After the 
sample has been placed in the bomb, the bomb is sealed and pressurized with oxy-
gen. It is then placed in the calorimeter and covered with an accurately measured 
quantity of water. The combustion reaction is initiated by passing an electrical cur-
rent through a fine wire in contact with the sample. When the wire becomes suffi-
ciently hot, the sam
