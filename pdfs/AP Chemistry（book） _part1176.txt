iodic table. (iii) Valence 
electrons screen the nuclear charge more effectively than do 
core electrons. (iv) The effective nuclear charge shows a sudden 
decrease when we go from the end of one row to the beginning 
of the next row of the periodic table. (v) The change in effec-
tive nuclear charge going down a column of the periodic table is 
generally less than that going across a row of the periodic table.
 7.15  Detailed calculations show that the value of Zeff for the 
outermost electrons in Na and K atoms is 2.51+ and 3.49+, 
respectively. (a) What value do you estimate for Zeff expe-
rienced by the outermost electron in both Na and K by 
assuming core electrons contribute 1.00 and valence elec-
trons contribute 0.00 to the screening constant? (b) What 
values do you estimate for Zeff using Slaterâ€™s rules? (c) Which 
approach gives a more accurate estimate of Zeff? (d) Does 
either method of approximation account for the gradual 
increase in Zeff that occurs upon moving down a
