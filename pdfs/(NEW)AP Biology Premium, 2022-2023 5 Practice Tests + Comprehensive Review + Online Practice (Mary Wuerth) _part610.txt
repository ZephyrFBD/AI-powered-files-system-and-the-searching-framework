duced in the reaction, the darker brown the
solution formed will be. By adding guaiacol to the reaction, a colorimetric assay of the relative amounts of oxygen
produced can be performed. A spectrophotometer set to measure absorbance at 470 nm, the wavelength most
absorbed by tetraguaiacol, can be used to quantify the color of each tube and therefore the relative amount of oxygen
produced. If a spectrophotometer is not available, a simple color chart can be used to quantify the relative amount of
oxygen produced.
Different environmental conditions can be changed to measure their effects on the production of oxygen by this
enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Some common independent variables in this experiment include exposing the enzyme to
different pH levels or temperatures. A sample data set from a temperature experiment is shown in the table and in
Figure 24.14.
