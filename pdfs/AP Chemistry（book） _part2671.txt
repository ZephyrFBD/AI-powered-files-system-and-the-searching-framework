 (a) Write the rate law for the reaction. 
 
 (b) By what factor will the rate of the reaction change if 
the pH is lowered from 5.00 to 3.50? Does the reaction 
proceed more quickly or more slowly at the lower pH? 
 
 (c) By using the concepts discussed in Section 14.6, ex-
plain how the reaction can be pH-dependent even though 
H+ does not appear in the overall reaction.
 16.126 (a)   
Using dissociation constants from Appendix D, deter-
mine the value for the equilibrium constant for each of 
the following reactions.
 
   (i) HCO3
-1aq2 + OH-1aq2 ∆CO3
2-1aq2 + H2O1l2
 
    (ii) NH4
+1aq2 + CO3
2-1aq2 ∆NH31aq2 + HCO3
-1aq2
 
  
(b)  
We usually use single arrows for reactions when the for-
ward reaction is appreciable (K much greater than 1) 
 
or when products escape from the system, so that 
equilibrium is never established. If we follow this con-
vention, which of these equilibria might be written 
with a single arr
