population of clones that develop
into effector and memory cells. The effector cells are short-lived and
begin battle immediately. They neutralize or destroy all of those identified
antigens and any pathogen that produces them. The remaining clones
develop into long-term memory cells that remain in the body for the rest
of one’s life and can rapidly respond to any future exposure to the same
antigen, even many years later. Memory cells are responsible for what is
called immunological memory and the fact that you generally don’t get
measles, for example, a second time.

Antibodies
Antibodies, also called immunoglobulins, are a group of globular
proteins. Each antibody molecule is a Y-shaped molecule consisting of
four polypeptide chains: two identical heavy chains and two identical light
chains joined by disulfide bridges. The molecule consists of four
unchanging or constant regions (C)
