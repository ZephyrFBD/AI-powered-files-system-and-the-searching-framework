in differ-
ent directions through the solid. Along the carbon planes, graphite 
possesses great strength because of the number and strength of the 
carbon–carbon bonds in this direction. The bonds between planes 
are relatively weak, however, making graphite weak in that direction.
Fibers of graphite can be prepared in which the carbon planes 
are aligned to varying extents parallel to the fiber axis. These fibers 
are lightweight (density of about 2 g>cm3) and chemically quite 
unreactive. The oriented fibers are made by first slowly pyrolyz-
ing (decomposing by action of heat) organic fibers at about 150 to 
300 °C. These fibers are then heated to about 2500 °C to graphitize 
them (convert amorphous carbon to graphite). Stretching the fiber 
during pyrolysis helps orient the graphite planes parallel to the 
fiber axis. More amorphous carbon fibers are formed by pyrolysis of 
organic fibers at lower temperatures (1200 to 400 °C). These amor-
phous materials, commonly called carbon fib
