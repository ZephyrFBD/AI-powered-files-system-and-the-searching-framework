At 1 degree of freedom, the critical value for a p-value of 0.05 is 3.84. The calculated chi-square is
above that, so the null hypothesis should be rejected. The p-value is less than 0.05.
5. The correct answer is (B). All bacteria will grow if there is no antibiotic present (erythromycin).
However, they would need the plasmid and the cellulose to produce insulin. If erythromycin is
present, the plasmid would be necessary for them to grow. So, bacteria will grow on plates 1, 2, and 3.
On plate 4, erythromycin will kill the bacteria and on plate 5, bacteria will grow, but will also produce
insulin.
6. (C) is correct. Any of the plates with bacteria that received the plasmid will contain the insulin gene,
even if it is not expressed. So plates 2, 3, and 5 will all have the insulin gene.
7. (A) is correct. During glycolysis, NAD+ acts as an oxidizing agent in order to oxidize glucose to
pyruvate. When NAD+ is reduced, it becomes NADH
