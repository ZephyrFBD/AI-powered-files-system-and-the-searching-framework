These questions are designed to see how well you understand and can explain the key 
concepts related to cell division before you begin your investigations.  
1. How did you develop from a single-celled zygote to an organism with trillions of 
cells? How many mitotic cell divisions would it take for one zygote to grow into an 
organism with 100 trillion cells? 
2. How is cell division important to a single-celled organism? 
3. What must happen to ensure successful cell division? 
4. How does the genetic information in one of your body cells compare to that found in 
other body cells? 
5. What are some advantages of asexual reproduction in plants? 
6. Why is it important for DNA to be replicated prior to cell division? 
7

 How do chromosomes move inside a cell during cell division? 
8. How is the cell cycle controlled? What would happen if the control were defective?
