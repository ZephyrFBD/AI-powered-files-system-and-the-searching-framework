s equilibrium?
(a) 15.0 g CaCO3, 15.0 g CaO, and 4.25 g CO2
(b) 2.50 g CaCO3, 25.0 g CaO, and 5.66 g CO2
(a) 30.5 g CaCO3, 25.5 g CaO, and 6.48 g CO2
 15.85 When 1.50 mol CO2 and 1.50 mol H2 are placed in a 
3.00-L container at 395 °C, the following reaction occurs: 
CO21g2 + H21g2 ∆ CO1g2 + H2O1g2. If Kc = 0.802, 
what are the concentrations of each substance in the 
equilibrium mixture?
 15.86 The equilibrium constant Kc for C1s2 + CO21g2 ∆ 
2 CO1g2 is 1.9 at 1000 K and 0.133 at 298 K. (a) If excess 
C is allowed to react with 25.0 g of CO2 in a 3.00-L vessel 
at 1000 K, how many grams of CO are produced? (b) How 
many grams of C are consumed? (c) If a smaller vessel is 
used for the reaction, will the yield of CO be greater or 
smaller? (d) Is the reaction endothermic or exothermic?
 15.87 NiO is to be reduced to nickel metal in an industrial pro-
cess by use of the reaction
NiO1s2 + CO1g2 ∆ Ni1s2 + CO21g2
 
 At 1600 K, the equilibrium constant for the reaction 
is Kp = 6.0 * 102. I
