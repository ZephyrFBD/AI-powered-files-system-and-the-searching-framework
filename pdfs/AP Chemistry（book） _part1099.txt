fluence atomic size also influence ionization energies. The energy needed to remove 
an electron from the outermost occupied shell depends on both the effective nuclear 
charge and the average distance of the electron from the nucleus. Either increasing the 
effective nuclear charge or decreasing the distance from the nucleus increases the attrac-
tion between the electron and the nucleus. As this attraction increases, it becomes more 
difficult to remove the electron, and, thus, the ionization energy increases. As we move 
across a period, there is both an increase in effective nuclear charge and a decrease in 
atomic radius, causing the ionization energy to increase. As we move down a column, 
the atomic radius increases, while the effective nuclear charge increases only gradually. 
The increase in radius dominates, so the attraction between the nucleus and the electron 
decreases, causing the ionization energy to decrease.
