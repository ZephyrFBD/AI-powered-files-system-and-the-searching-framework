1.7.3 Real Zeros 
To help us understand the next theorem, let’s consider the polynomial 
 
 
If the polynomial P(x) = anxn + an-1xn-1 + … + a1x +a0 has integer coefficients, (where an ≠ 0 
and a0 ≠ 0), then every rational zero of P is of the form p/q 
where p and q are integers and p is a factor of the constant coefficient a0 and q is a factor 
of the leading coefficient an.

FINDING THE RATIONAL ZEROS OF A POLYNOMIAL 
1. List Possible Zeros. List all possible rational zeros, using the Rational Zeros Theorem. 
2. Divide. Use synthetic division to evaluate the polynomial at each of the candidates for 
the rational zeros that you found in Step 1. When the remainder is 0, note the quotient 
you have obtained. 
3. Repeat. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for the quotient. Stop when you reach a quotient that is 
quadratic or factors easily, and use the quadratic formula or factor to find the remaining
