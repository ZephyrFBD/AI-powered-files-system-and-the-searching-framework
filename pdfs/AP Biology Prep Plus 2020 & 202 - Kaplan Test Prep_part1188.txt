rent traits while in

other) occurs. Species diverge in sympatric speciation due to behavioral,
temporal, and resource-based mechanisms of reproductive isolation. In
The three stages of speciation are separation, evolution, and reproductive isolation resulting
in a new species.
In allopatric speciation, the original population is separated into two distinct populations by
some geographic barrier. In sympatric speciation, polymorphism occurs.
sympatric speciation, groups of similar organisms can coexist in the same
geographic area (or overlapping geographic areas) without interbreeding.
(c) Selecting from allopatric and sympatric speciation, identify which type
of speciation A and B in the figure represent. (1 point)

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Allopatric speciation involves geographic barriers that physically isolate
populations, which is shown in the initial st
