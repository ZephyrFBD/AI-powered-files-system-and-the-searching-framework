 the unoccupied 
space in which real molecules can move is less than the container 
volume. At low pressures, the combined volume of the gas molecules 
is negligible relative to the container volume. Thus, the unoccupied 
volume available to the molecules is essentially the container vol-
ume. At high pressures, the combined volume of the gas molecules is 
not negligible relative to the container volume. Now the unoccupied 
volume available to the molecules is less than the container volume. 
At high pressures, therefore, gas volumes tend to be slightly greater 
than those predicted by the ideal-gas equation.
Another reason for nonideal behavior at high pressures is that 
the attractive forces between molecules come into play at the short 
intermolecular distances found when molecules are crowded together 
at high pressures. Because of these attractive forces, the impact of a 
given molecule with the container wall is lessened. If we could stop 
the motion in a gas, as illustrated in F
