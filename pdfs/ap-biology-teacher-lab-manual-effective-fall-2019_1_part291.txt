er moves from the surrounding area, where the water potential is higher 
(ψ = 0), into the cell, where water potential is lower because of solutes in the cytoplasm 
(ψ is negative). It is assumed that the solute is not diffusing (Figure 1a). The movement 
of water into the cell causes the cell to swell, and the cell membrane pushes against 
the cell wall to produce an increase in pressure. This pressure, which counteracts the 
diffusion of water into the cell, is called turgor pressure.

Over time, enough positive turgor pressure builds up to oppose the more negative 
solute potential of the cell. Eventually, the water potential of the cell equals the water 
potential of the pure water outside the cell (ψ of cell = ψ of pure water = 0). At this point, 
a dynamic equilibrium is reached and net water movement ceases (Figure 1b).
