membering these elements is the acronym CHONPS.)
Why are these macronutrients needed in large amounts? They are the components of organic compounds in cells, including
water. Carbon is the major element in all macromolecules: carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and many other
compounds. Carbon accounts for about 50 percent of the composition of the cell. Nitrogen represents 12 percent of the total
dry weight of a typical cell and is a component of proteins, nucleic acids, and other cell constituents. Most of the nitrogen
available in nature is either atmospheric nitrogen (N2) or another inorganic form. Diatomic (N2) nitrogen, however, can be
converted into an organic form only by certain organisms, called nitrogen-fixing organisms. Both hydrogen and oxygen are
part of many organic compounds and of water. Phosphorus is required by all organisms for the synthesis of nucleotides
and phospholipids. Sulfur is part of the structure of some amino acids such as cysteine and methion
