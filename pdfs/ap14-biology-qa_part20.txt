rs should provide every opportunity for students to connect concepts 
across organizational levels (e.g., molecules, cells, organisms, and communities). 
Question 7 
What was the intent of this question? 
Question 7 asks students to analyze data to connect patterns in an abiotic factor to behavioral mechanisms 
used to maintain homeostasis. Students were asked to describe a method of thermoregulation most likely 
used by the animal species. Students were asked to justify their answer using a graph that shows an 
increasing rate of oxygen consumption with increasing environmental temperature. Students were then 
asked to refine a model (graph) by drawing a line illustrating the relationship between body temperature 
and environmental temperature for the species in question. 
How well did students perform on this question? 
The mean score for this question was 0.90 out of a possible 3 points. 
What were common student errors or omissions?  
Students often described the mode of thermoregu
