ision? Think about the conservation laws. They are your tools. Start a problem
by asking yourself whether the conservation laws apply in the given situation.
Here, we determined that momentum is conserved only during the brief colli-
sion, which we called part (1). But in part (1), because the collision is inelastic, the
conservation of mechanical energy is not valid. Then in part (2), conservation 
of mechanical energy is valid, but not conservation of momentum.
Note, however, that if there had been significant motion of the pendulum
during the deceleration of the projectile in the block, then there would have
been an external force (gravity) during the collision, so conservation of momen-
tum would not have been valid in part (1).
