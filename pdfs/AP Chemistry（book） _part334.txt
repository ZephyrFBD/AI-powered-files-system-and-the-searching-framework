, barium oxide  
(e) Mn3(PO4)2, manganese(II) phosphate
 
â–¶Practice Exercise 2
Name the ionic compounds (a) NH4Br, (b) Cr2O3, (c) Co1NO322.
SOLUTION
In naming ionic compounds, it is important to recognize polyatomic 
ions and to determine the charge of cations with variable charge.
(a)  
The cation is K+, the potassium ion, and the anion is SO4
2-, 
the sulfate ion, making the name potassium sulfate. (If you 
thought the compound contained S2- and O2- ions, you  
failed to  
recognize the polyatomic sulfate ion.)
(b)  
The cation is Ba2+, the barium ion, and the anion is OH-, the 
 
hydroxide ion: barium hydroxide.
(c)  
You must determine the charge of Fe in this compound 
 
because an iron atom can form more than one cation.  
Because the compound contains three chloride ions, Cl-, the 
cation must be Fe3+, the iron(III), or ferric, ion. Thus, the com-
pound is iron(III) chloride or ferric chloride.
Give It Some Thought 
Calcium bicarbonate is also called calcium hydrogen carbonate.
