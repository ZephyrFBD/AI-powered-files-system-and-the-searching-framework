CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
15. Describe what happens to the tetrads after they form.
a.
Prophase I of meiosis forms the tetrads. They
line up at the midway point between the two
poles of the cell to form the metaphase plate.
There is equal chance of a microtubule fiber to
encounter a maternally or a paternally inherited
chromosome. Orientation of each tetrad is
independent of the orientation of other tetrads.
b.
Prophase II of meiosis forms the tetrads. They
line up at the midway point between the two
poles of the cell to form the metaphase plate.
There is equal chance of microtubule fiber to
encounter maternally or paternally inherited
chromosome. Or
