race amount of 
a dopant means that extreme care must be taken to control the impurities in semiconduc-
tors. The semiconductor industry uses “nine-nines” silicon to make integrated circuits; 
what this means is that Si must be 99.999999999% pure (nine nines after the decimal 
place) to be technologically useful! Doping provides an opportunity for controlling the 
electrical conductivity through precise control of the type and concentration of dopants.
It is also possible to dope semiconductors with atoms that have fewer valence elec-
trons than the host material. Consider what happens when a few aluminum atoms 
replace silicon atoms in a silicon crystal. Aluminum has only three valence electrons 
compared to silicon’s four. Thus, there are electron vacancies, known as holes, in the 
valence band when silicon is doped with aluminum [Figure 12.31(c)]. Since the neg-
atively charged electron is not there, the hole can be thought of as having a positive 
charge. Any adjacent electron that
