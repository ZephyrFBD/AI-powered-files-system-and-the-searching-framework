ow we’re ready to tally up the number of ATP produced.
So far, we’ve made only four ATP—two ATP from glycolysis and two ATP from the Krebs cycle.
Although that seems like a lot of work for only four ATP, we have also produced hydrogen and electron carriers in
the form of 10 NADH and 2 FADH2. These molecules will, in turn, produce lots of ATP in the next stage of cellular
respiration.
Stage 4: Oxidative Phosphorylation
Electron Transport Chain
As electrons (and the hydrogen atoms to which they belong) are removed from a molecule of glucose, they carry
with them much of the energy that was originally stored in their chemical bonds. These electrons—and their
accompanying energy—are then transferred to readied hydrogen carrier molecules. In the case of cellular
respiration, these charged carriers are the coenzymes NADH and FADH2.
Let’s see how many “loaded” electron carriers we’ve produced. We now have:
2 NADH molecules from glycolysis
2 NADH from the production of acetyl-CoA
6 NADH from t
