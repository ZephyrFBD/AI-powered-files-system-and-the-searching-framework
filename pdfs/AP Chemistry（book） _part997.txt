 on the value of a quantum number, n, called the 
principal quantum number. The value of n must be a positive integer 
(1, 2, 3, . . .), and each value of n corresponds to a different specific 
energy, En. The energy of the atom increases as n increases. The low-
est energy is achieved for n = 1; this is called the ground state of the 
 
hydrogen atom. Other values of n correspond to excited states. Light 
is emitted when the electron drops from a higher-energy state to a 
lower-energy state; light is absorbed to excite the electron from a 
lower-energy state to a higher one. The frequency of light emitted or 
absorbed is such that hn equals the difference in energy between two 
allowed states.
WAVE BEHAVIOR OF MATTER (SECTION 6.4) De Broglie  
proposed 
that matter, such as electrons, should exhibit wave-like proper-
ties. This hypothesis of matter waves was proved experimentally by 
 
observing the diffraction of electrons. An object has a characteristic 
wavelength that depends on i
