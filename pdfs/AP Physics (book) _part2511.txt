FIGURE 23–5 Example 23–1.
Reflection from flat mirrors. Two flat mirrors are perpen-
dicular to each other. An incoming beam of light makes an angle of 15° with the
first mirror as shown in Fig. 23–5a. What angle will the outgoing beam make with
the second mirror?
APPROACH We sketch the path of the beam as it reflects off the two mirrors, and
draw the two normals to the mirrors for the two reflections. We use geometry and
the law of reflection to find the various angles.
EXAMPLE 23;1
SOLUTION In Fig.23–5b,
so
by the law of reflection
too. Using the fact that the sum of the three angles of a triangle is
always 180°, and noting that the two normals to the two mirrors are perpendicular
to each other, we have
. Thus
By the law of reflection,
so 
is the angle the reflected
ray makes with the second mirror surface.
NOTE The outgoing ray is parallel to the incoming ray. Reflectors on bicycles,
