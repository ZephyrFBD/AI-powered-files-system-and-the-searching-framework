ould have two copies of the normal non-colorblind allele.
c. Of the individuals with a “?”, identify which of them is heterozygous.
Individual 11 must be heterozygous. She must have passed on a colorblind copy of an X-chromosome since her
daughter is color-blind and must have received a color-blind allele from each of her parents. She is not homozygous
recessive since she has sons that received an X from her and they are not affected so the X must have been normal. So
she must be a heterozygote.
Individual 2 must also be heterozygous since some of the daughters have a copy, but they could not have received
one from the father since he is unaffected, so they must have received the copy from the mother. Again, she can’t be a
homozygous recessive since she gave her sons a good normal X.
d. It is possible for a mother to pass on either of her two copies of a gene. Explain why this is helpful to prepare
populations for selective pressures.
It is helpful because it creates genetic diversity
