applied contexts.
IST-1.P: Explain the use 
of genetic engineering 
techniques in analyzing or 
manipulating DNA.
Biotechnology
(A) 
Incorrect. The diagram indicates that the polymerase from T. aquaticus 
is used during steps of PCR that reach temperatures above 68Â°C.
(B) 
Correct. The polymerase enzyme of T. aquaticus is used because it 
evolved to function at temperatures close to boiling without denaturing.
(C) 
Incorrect. Polymerase from other organisms can be used repetitively, 
but only the polymerase from heat-tolerant organisms like T. aquaticus 
can be used in PCR, during which the polymerase is repeatedly used at 
high temperatures that would degrade polymerase from other species.
(D) 
Incorrect. Polymerase is widely conserved across organisms, and its 
functionality does not vary.
