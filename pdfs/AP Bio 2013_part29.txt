 9. In 1944 Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty 
performed transformation experiments using  
live, harmless bacteria and extracts from virulent 
bacteria treated with various enzymes. Which of 
the following enzymes were used and why? 
(A) Proteases and RNases to rule out protein and 
RNA as the transforming factors 
(B) Lipase (an enzyme that facilitates the 
breakdown of lipids) to rule out lipoproteins 
as the transforming factor 
(C) Kinase (an enzyme that facilitates transfer of 
a phosphate group from ATP to a substrate 
molecule) to show that transformation is 
phosphorylation dependent 
(D) ATPase to show that transformation is not 
dependent on ATP
