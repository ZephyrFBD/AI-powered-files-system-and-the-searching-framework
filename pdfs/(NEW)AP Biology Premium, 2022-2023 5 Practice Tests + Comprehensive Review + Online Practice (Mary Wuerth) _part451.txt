 resistant is grown on an antibiotic-free LB agar plate (plate 1), the starter plate.
Some of the E. coli from the starter plate are then spread on a plate that contains LB agar and 50 ug/mL of the
antibiotic ampicillin (plate 2), and some of the E. coli are spread on a plate that contains LB agar without
antibiotic (plate 3). E. coli from plate 2 are then spread on a plate that contains LB agar and 100 ug/mL of the
antibiotic ampicillin (plate 4). E. coli from plate 3 are then spread on a plate that contains LB agar without
antibiotic (plate 5). A diagram of the experimental plates is shown in the figure.
(a) Describe whether E. coli that are all susceptible to ampicillin, all resistant to ampicillin, or a mix of both
will grow on the starter plate. Explain your answer using the principles of natural selection.
(b) Identify the plates that serve as controls in this experiment. Identify the independent variable in the
experiment.
(c) Predict the relative amount of E. coli growth on pla
