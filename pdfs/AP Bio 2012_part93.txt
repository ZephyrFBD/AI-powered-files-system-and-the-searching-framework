g the drought period.
(B)
This option is incorrect. Although the drought period was from 1981 to 1987, 
measurements of beak size were determined only for 1987, likely too short a time 
period to observe/measure evolutionary change. Additionally, the measurements 
were estimations, and the sample size was small. 
(C)
This option is correct. It demonstrates ability to apply the scientific method 
to evaluate data that illustrate evolution as an ongoing process. Based on 
observation, the beak sizes of a large number of individuals were measured 
between the time interval (1981 to 1987) correlating with the period of drought.
(D)
This option is incorrect. Although the drought period was from 1981 to 1987, 
beak sizes were measured only in 1981. Measurements of offspring beak sizes 
were determined, not measurements of beak sizes in the original population; 
thus, comparisons about changes in beak sizes between generations cannot be 
accurately determined.
