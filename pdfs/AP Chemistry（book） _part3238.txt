20.7 ∣ Batteries and Fuel Cells
A battery is a portable, self-contained electrochemical power source that consists of 
one or more voltaic cells. For example, the 1.5-V batteries used to power flashlights 
and many consumer electronic devices are single voltaic cells. Greater voltages can be 
achieved by using multiple cells, as in 12-V automotive batteries. When cells are con-
nected in series (which means the cathode of one attached to the anode of another), the 
battery produces a voltage that is the sum of the voltages of the individual cells. Higher 
voltages can also be achieved by using multiple batteries in series (Figure 20.18). Battery 
electrodes are marked following the convention of Figure 20.6—plus for cathode and 
minus for anode.
Although any spontaneous redox reaction can serve as the basis for a voltaic cell, 
making a commercial battery that has specific performance characteristics requires con-
