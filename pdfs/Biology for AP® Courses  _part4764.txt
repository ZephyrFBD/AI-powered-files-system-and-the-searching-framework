re difficult or impossible to
predict. The collapse of fisheries has dramatic and long-lasting effects on local populations that work in the fishery. In
addition, the loss of an inexpensive protein source to populations that cannot afford to replace it will increase the cost of
living and limit societies in other ways. In general, the fish taken from fisheries have shifted to smaller species as larger
species are fished to extinction. The ultimate outcome could clearly be the loss of aquatic systems as food sources.

What would be the most effective approach to reversing the damage of overfishing?
a.
Ban all fishing in the oceans of the world for ten years.

The damage is irreparable and no measure will reverse the loss.
