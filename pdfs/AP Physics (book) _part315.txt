59. A projectile is shot from the edge of a cliff 115 m above
ground level with an initial speed of 
at an angle of
35.0° with the horizontal, as shown in Fig. 3–51. (a) Deter-
mine the time taken by the projectile to hit point P at
ground level. (b) Determine the distance X of point P
from the base of the vertical cliff. At the instant just before
the projectile hits point P, find (c) the horizontal and the
vertical components of its velocity, (d) the magnitude of
the velocity, and (e) the angle made by the velocity vector
with the horizontal. (f) Find the maximum height above
