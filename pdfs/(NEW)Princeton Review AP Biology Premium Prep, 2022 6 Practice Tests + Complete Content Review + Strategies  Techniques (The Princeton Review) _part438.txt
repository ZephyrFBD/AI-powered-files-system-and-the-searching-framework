The 10% Rule
In a food chain, only about 10 percent of energy is transferred from one level to the next—this is called the 10%
rule. The other 90 percent is used for things like respiration, digestion, reproduction, running away from predators
—in other words, it’s used to power the organism doing the eating! This energy is eventually changed into heat
energy. As a level, producers have the most energy in an ecosystem; the primary consumers have less energy than
producers; secondary consumers have less energy than the primary consumers; and tertiary consumers have the least
energy of all.
Not For Individuals
This idea about energy does not apply to individuals. It means the level as a
whole has less energy if you add up all the members at that level.
The energy flow, biomass, and numbers of members within an ecosystem can be represented in an ecological
pyramid. Organisms that are higher up on the pyramid have less biomass and ener
