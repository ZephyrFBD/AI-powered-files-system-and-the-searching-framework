1. If a large amount of salt was added to the sealed tank where organism 4 was being kept, what would be the
effect on the intracellular osmolality of organism 4?
(A) Increase initially and then return to the initial state
(B) Increase and maintain the increased state
(C) Decrease and then return to the initial state
