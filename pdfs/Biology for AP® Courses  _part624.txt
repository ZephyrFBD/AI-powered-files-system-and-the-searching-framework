CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
18. Why do phospholipids tend to spontaneously orient
themselves into something resembling a membrane?
a.
Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules. The
polar head faces towards water and the nonpolar
fatty acid tails face towards other fatty acid tails.
b.
Phospholipids are lipophilic molecules. The
polar head faces towards water and the nonpolar
fatty acid tails face towards other fatty acid tails
c.
Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules. The
nonpolar head faces towards other fatty acid tails
and the polar fatty acid tails face towards water.
d.
Phospholipids are hydrophilic molecules. The
polar head faces towards water and the nonpolar
fatty acid tails face towards other fatty acid tails.
19. Why is it advantageous for the plasma membrane to be
fluid in nature?
a.
Fluidity allows greater flexibility to the cell and
motion of membrane components required for
transport.
