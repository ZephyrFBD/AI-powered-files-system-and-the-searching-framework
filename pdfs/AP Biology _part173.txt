5.1, the potential energy of the products
is less than the potential energy of the reactants, so energy is released and
the reaction is exergonic. The dotted line shows the same reaction when an
enzyme is introduced. The enzyme serves to lower the energy of
activation, and the reaction can proceed more quickly.

In the potential energy diagram in Figure 5.2, the potential energy of
the products is greater than the potential energy of the reactants, so energy
is absorbed and the reaction is endergonic. The dotted line shows the same

reaction when an enzyme is introduced. The enzyme serves to lower the
energy of activation, and the reaction can proceed more quickly.
Notice that in both reactions, the only factor altered by the presence of
an enzyme is the energy of activation and the energy of the activated
complex. The transition state is the reactive (unstable) condition of the
substrate after
