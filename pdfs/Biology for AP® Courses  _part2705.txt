n to delay senescence in leaf tissues, promote mitosis, and stimulate differentiation of the meristem in shoots and
roots. Many effects on plant development are under the influence of cytokinins, either in conjunction with auxin or another
hormone. For example, apical dominance seems to result from a balance between auxins that inhibit lateral buds, and
cytokinins that promote bushier growth.
Gibberellins
Gibberellins (GAs) are a group of about 125 closely related plant hormones that stimulate shoot elongation, seed
germination, and fruit and flower maturation. GAs are synthesized in the root and stem apical meristems, young leaves,
and seed embryos. In urban areas, GA antagonists are sometimes applied to trees under power lines to control growth and
reduce the frequency of pruning.
GAs break dormancy (a state of inhibited growth and development) in the seeds of plants that require exposure to cold or
