*87. For any type of wave that reaches a boundary beyond which
its speed is increased, there is a maximum incident angle if
there is to be a transmitted refracted wave. This maximum
incident angle 
corresponds to an angle of refraction
equal to 90°. If
all the wave is reflected at the
boundary and none is refracted, because refraction would
correspond to
(where 
is the angle of refraction),
which is impossible. This phenomenon is referred to as
total internal reflection. (a) Find a formula
for 
using the law of refraction,
Eq. 11–20. (b) How far from the
bank should a trout fisherman
stand (Fig. 11–61) so trout
won’t be frightened by his
voice (1.8 m above the
ground)? The speed
of sound is about
in air and
in water.

1. Describe a procedure to measure the spring constant k of
a car’s springs.
Assume that the owner’s manual 
gives the car’s mass M and that the shock absorbers are
worn out so that t
