 graph shows that CFTR protein already exists.
Therefore, CFTR is transcribed and translated, but not packaged in
the Golgi. Thus, choice B is also incorrect. Choice C is incorrect
because there is no information in the stem of the question and/or on
the graph that discusses “folding” of the CFTR protein.
(C) Choice A is incorrect because cystic fibrosis is solely an
inherited disease. No environmental component causes this disease.
It is autosomal recessive. In order to have the disease, a person must
have inherited two mutated genes, one from each parent. Therefore,
choice D is incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because polygenic
inheritance involves the inheritance of several genes. Examples are
height, skin, or hair color—any trait in which a tremendous variety
occurs in a population. In cystic fibrosis, one mutated gene causes
multiple medical problems, such as chronic bronchitis, recurrent
bacterial infections, and more.
(B) This question refers to the mitochondrial cristae membran
