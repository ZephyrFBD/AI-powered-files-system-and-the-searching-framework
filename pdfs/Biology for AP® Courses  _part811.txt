If oxygen is available, aerobic respiration will go forward. In eukaryotic cells, the pyruvate molecules produced at the end
of glycolysis are transported into mitochondria. There, pyruvate will be transformed into an acetyl group that will be picked
up and activated by a carrier compound called coenzyme A (CoA). The resulting compound is called acetyl CoA. CoA is
made from vitamin B5, pantothenic acid. Acetyl CoA can be used in a variety of ways by the cell, but its major function is
to deliver the acetyl group derived from pyruvate to the next stage of the pathway in glucose catabolism.
