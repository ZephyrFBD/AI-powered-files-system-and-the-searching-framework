(ln P
SO2Cl2) versus time, k = -slope = 2.19 * 10-5s-1 14.47 (a) The 
plot of 1>3A4 versus time is linear, so the reaction is second order in 
[A]. (b) k = 0.040 M-1 min-1 (c) t1>2 = 38 min  14.49 (a) The plot 
of 1>3NO24 versus time is linear, so the reaction is second order in 
NO2.  (b) k = slope = 10 M-1s-1 (c) rate at 0.200 M = 0.400 M  >  s, 
rate at 0.100 M = 0.100 M  >  s; rate at 0.050 M = 0.025 M  >  s  
14.51 (a) The energy of the collision and the orientation of the 
molecules when they collide determine whether a reaction will 
occur. (b) The rate constant usually increases with an increase in 
reaction temperature. (c) The fraction of molecules with energy 
greater than the activation energy changes most dramatically with 
temperature. Frequency of collision and the orientation factor are 
lumped into the frequency factor, A, which is considered to be con-
stant with temperature. 14.53 f = 4.94 * 10-2. At 400 K, approxi
