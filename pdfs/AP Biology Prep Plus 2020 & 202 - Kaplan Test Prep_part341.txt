d to monitor the activity of
peroxidases. In the presence of peroxidases, AR reacts with
hydrogen peroxide to produce a fluorescent red product,
resorufin, which can be measured with a fluorometer. The figure
shows an experiment that examined the rate of a reaction at
diﬀerent concentrations of H2O2 and AR.
Why do the curves level oﬀ at a concentration slightly above 20
μM of H2O2?

The reaction rate levels oﬀ as the temperature increases
because most enzymes are proteins and denature at high
temperatures.
(A)
The reaction rate levels oﬀ as the substrate concentration
decreases; as the H2O2 concentration increases towards the
right of the graph, the concentration of AR decreases
simultaneously.
(B)
The induced fit model states that the active site changes
shape as the substrate binds. This is not possible when the
H2O2 concentration becomes too high.
