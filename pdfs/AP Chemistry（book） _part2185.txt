ness of the curve decreases with time, indicating a decreasing 
reaction rate.
Instantaneous Rate
Graphs such as Figure 14.3 that show how the concentration 
of a reactant or product changes with time allow us to evalu-
ate the instantaneous rate of a reaction, which is the rate 
at a particular instant during the reaction. The instantaneous 
rate is determined from the slope of the curve at a particular 
point in time. We have drawn two tangent lines in Figure 14.3, 
a dashed line running through the point at t = 0 s and a solid 
line running through the point at t = 600 s. The slopes of 
these tangent lines give the instantaneous rates at these two 
time points.* To determine the instantaneous rate at 600 s, for 
example, we construct horizontal and vertical lines to form the 
blue right triangle in Figure 14.3. The slope of the tangent line 
is the ratio of the height of the vertical side to the length of the 
horizontal side:
