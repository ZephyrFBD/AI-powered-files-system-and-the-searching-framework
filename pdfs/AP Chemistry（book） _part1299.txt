of electrons occurs. However, in a few molecules and 
polyatomic ions, such as ClO2, NO, NO2, and O2
-, the number of valence electrons is 
odd. Complete pairing of these electrons is impossible, and an octet around each atom 
cannot be achieved. For example, NO contains 5 + 6 = 11 valence electrons. The two 
most important Lewis structures for this molecule are
N
O
and
N
O
Less than an Octet of Valence Electrons
A second type of exception occurs when there are fewer than eight valence electrons around 
an atom in a molecule or polyatomic ion. This situation is also relatively rare (with the excep-
tion of hydrogen and helium as we have already discussed), and is most often encountered in 
compounds of boron and beryllium. As an example, letâ€™s consider boron trifluoride, BF3. If 
we follow the first steps of our procedure for drawing Lewis structures, we obtain the structure
Give It Some Thought
Which of the Lewis structures for NO is dominant based on analysis of the formal 
charges?
