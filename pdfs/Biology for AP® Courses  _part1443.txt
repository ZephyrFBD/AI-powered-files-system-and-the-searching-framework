ister chromatids fail to separate during
meiosis, resulting in an abnormal chromosome number. Nondisjunction may occur during meiosis I or meiosis II.
Which of the following statements about nondisjunction is true?
a.
Nondisjunction only results in gametes with n+1 or n-1 chromosomes.
b.
Nondisjunction occurring during meiosis II results in 50% normal gametes.
c.
Nondisjunction during meiosis I results in 50% normal gametes.
d.
Nondisjunction always results in four different kinds of gametes.
Aneuploidy
An individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid; in humans, euploidy
corresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. An individual with an error in chromosome number
is described as aneuploid, a term that includes monosomy (loss of one chromosome) or trisomy (gain of an extraneous
chromosome). Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because
they lack essential genes
