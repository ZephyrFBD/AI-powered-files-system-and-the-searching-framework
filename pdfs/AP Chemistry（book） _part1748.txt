heating Curves
When we heat an ice cube initially at -25 °C and 1 atm pressure, the temperature of the 
ice increases. As long as the temperature is below 0 °C, the ice cube remains in the solid 
state. When the temperature reaches 0 °C, the ice begins to melt. Because melting is an 
endothermic process, the heat we add at 0 °C is used to convert ice to liquid water, and 
the temperature remains constant until all the ice has melted. Once all the ice has melted, 
adding more heat causes the temperature of the liquid water to increase.
A graph of temperature versus amount of heat added is 
called a heating curve. Figure 11.22 shows the heating curve for 
transforming ice, H2O1s2, initially at -25 °C to steam, H2O1g2, 
at 125 °C. As heat is added at a constant rate, the heating curve 
forms distinct regions:
t  
Line AB: Heating increases the temperature of H2O(s) from 
–25 to 0 °C.
t Line BC: Heating converts H2O(s) to H2O( l ) as the ice melts
