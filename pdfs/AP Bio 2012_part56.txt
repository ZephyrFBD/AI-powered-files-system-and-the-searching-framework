53. Which of the following best describes the 
physiological significance of the different  
oxygen-binding capabilities of hemoglobin and 
myoglobin? 
(A) They prevent muscles from depleting oxygen 
levels in the blood.

54. The regulatory sequences of the operon controlling arabinose metabolism (ara operon) were studied to 
determine whether bacteria can respond to changes in nutrient availability. It is predicted that if those regulatory 
sequences are functioning properly, the bacteria will produce the enzymes involved in arabinose metabolism 
(structural genes B, A, and D) in the pres
