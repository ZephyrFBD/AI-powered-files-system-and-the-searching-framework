to land a 15-lb trout on 10-lb test line? Why or why not?
82. A “doomsday” asteroid with a mass of 
is
hurtling through space. Unless the asteroid’s speed is
changed by about 
it will collide with Earth and
cause tremendous damage. Researchers suggest that a
small “space tug” sent to the asteroid’s surface could exert
a gentle constant force of 2.5 N. For how long must this
force act?
83. Three mountain climbers who are roped together in a line
are ascending an icefield inclined at 31.0° to the horizontal
(Fig. 4–69). The last climber slips, pulling the second
climber off his feet. The first climber is able to hold them
both. If each climber has a mass of 75 kg, calculate the ten-
sion in each of the two sections of rope between the three
climbers. Ignore friction between the ice and the fallen
climbers.
