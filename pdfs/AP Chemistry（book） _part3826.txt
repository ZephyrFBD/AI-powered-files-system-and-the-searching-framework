▲ Figure 24.7 The alkene C4H8 has four structural isomers.
Give It Some Thought
How many distinct locations are there for a double bond in a five-carbon linear chain?

CHAPTER 24 The Chemistry of Life: Organic and Biological Chemistry
If a substance contains two or more double bonds, the location of each is indi-
cated by a numerical prefix, and the ending of the name is altered to identify the 
number of double bonds: diene (two), triene (three), and so forth. For example, 
CH2 “CH¬CH2¬CH“CH2 is 1,4-pentadiene.
The two isomers on the right in Figure 24.7 differ in the relative locations of their 
methyl groups. These two compounds are geometric isomers, compounds that have 
the same molecular formula and the same groups bonded
