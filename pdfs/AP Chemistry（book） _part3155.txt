 is the anode, and the 
electrode where reduction occurs is the 
cathode.
 20.4 ▶  Cell Potentials under Standard 
Conditions Learn about cell potential, 
which is the potential difference or voltage 
between the two electrodes of a voltaic cell. 
The cell potential can be calculated from 
the standard reduction potentials of the 
half-reactions occurring at each electrode.
 20.5 ▶  Free Energy and Redox Reactions 
 
Relate the Gibbs free energy, ∆G°, to cell 
potential.
 20.6 ▶  Cell Potentials under 
Nonstandard Conditions Calculate 
cell potentials under nonstandard conditions 
using standard cell potentials and the 
Nernst equation.
 20.7 ▶  Batteries and Fuel Cells Learn 
about batteries and fuel cells, which are 
commercially important energy sources that 
use electrochemical reactions.
 20.8 ▶  Corrosion Focus on corrosion, a 
spontaneous electrochemical process 
involving metals.
 20.9 ▶  Electrolysis Examine electrolytic cells, 
which use electricity to drive chemical 
reactio
