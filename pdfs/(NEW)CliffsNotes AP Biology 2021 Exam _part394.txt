One of the earliest advocates for evolution was naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. His theory included the
following two ideas:
1. Use and disuse described how body parts of organisms can develop with increased usage, while unused parts
weaken. This idea was correct, as is commonly observed among athletes who train for competitions.
2. Inheritance of acquired characteristics described how body features acquired during the lifetime of an
organism (such as muscle bulk) could be passed on to offspring. This, however, was incorrect. Only changes in the
genetic material of cells can be passed on to offspring.
Fifty years after Lamarck published his ideas, naturalist Charles Darwin published The Origin of Species. Darwin’s
theory, discussed later in this chapter, was that natural selection, or “survival of the fittest,” was the driving force of
evolution.
There is abundant evidence that evolution occurs—that some species change over time, that
