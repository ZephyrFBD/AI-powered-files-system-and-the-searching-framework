NA in an effort to
determine its origin. DNA maps are “DNA fingerprints” that identify the individual from whom they came. They
can help recognize mutations, identify species, produce family trees, or establish evolutionary relationships.
Part III: Separating DNA Fragments
In this part of the investigation, DNA fragments (restriction fragment length polymorphisms, or RFLPs) are
separated using gel electrophoresis. The steps are summarized here:
1. To prepare a gel, a liquefied porous material (usually agarose) is poured into a tray fitted with combs, a device
that allows the formation of sample wells (holes). After the gel cools and solidifies, the combs are removed to
expose the wells.
2. The DNA to be analyzed is digested (cleaved) with a restriction enzyme. (This already may have been done for
you.) A tracking dye is added to the sample. This allows the leading edge of DNA migration to be observed.
3. Load the DNA sample into a well in the gel in the tray of the electrophoresis appa
