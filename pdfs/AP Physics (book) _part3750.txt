The History
We begin at a time only a minuscule fraction of a second after the “beginning” of
the universe,
This time (sometimes referred to as the Planck time) is an
unimaginably short time, and predictions can be only speculative. Earlier, we can
say nothing because we do not have a theory of quantum gravity which would be
needed for the incredibly high densities and temperatures during this “Planck era.”
The first theories of the Big Bang assumed the universe was extremely hot in
the beginning, maybe 1032 K, and then gradually cooled down while expanding.
In those first moments after 
s, the four forces of nature were thought to be
united—there was only one force (Chapter 32, Fig. 32–22). Then a kind of

“phase transition” would have occurred during which the gravitational force
would have “condensed out” as a separate force. This and subsequent phase
transitions, as shown i
