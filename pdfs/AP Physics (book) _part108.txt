The formula for a quantity may be different in different cases, but the dimen-
sions remain the same. For example, the area of a triangle of base b and height h
is
whereas the area of a circle of radius r is
The formulas
are different in the two cases, but the dimensions of area are always 
Dimensions can be used as a help in working out relationships, a procedure
referred to as dimensional analysis. One useful technique is the use of dimen-
sions to check if a relationship is incorrect. Note that we add or subtract
quantities only if they have the same dimensions (we don’t add centimeters 
and hours); and the quantities on each side of an equals sign must have the
same dimensions. (In numerical calculations, the units must also be the same on
both sides of an equation.)
For example, suppose you derived the equation
