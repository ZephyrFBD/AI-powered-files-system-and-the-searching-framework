ometry. When, however, one or more domains involve nonbonding pairs of electrons, we 
must remember that the molecular geometry involves only electron domains due to bonds even 
though the nonbonding pairs contribute to the electron-domain geometry.
Give It Some Thought
Suppose a particular AB3 molecule has the resonance structure
Does this structure follow the octet rule? How many electron domains are there 
around the A atom?

CHAPTER 9 Molecular Geometry and Bonding Theories
How to Predict the Shapes of Molecules and Ions Using the VSEPR Model
 
1. Draw the Lewis structure of the molecule or ion 
 (Section 8.5), and count the 
number of electron domains around the central atom. Each nonbonding elec-
tron pair, each single bond, each double bond, and each triple bond counts as one 
electron domain.
 
2. Determine the electron-domain geometry by arranging the electron domains about the 
central atom so that the repulsions among them
