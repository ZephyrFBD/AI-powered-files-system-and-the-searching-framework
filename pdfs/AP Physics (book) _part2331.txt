Motor overload. When using an appliance
such as a blender, electric drill, or sewing machine, if the appliance is overloaded
or jammed so that the motor slows appreciably or stops while the power is still
connected, the motor can burn out and be ruined. Explain why this happens.
RESPONSE The motors are designed to run at a certain speed for a given applied
voltage, and the designer must take the expected back emf into account. If the
rotation speed is reduced, the back emf will not be as high as expected (
Eq. 21–5). The current will increase and may become large enough that the
windings of the motor heat up and may melt, ruining the motor.
