decreasing osmolarity because more salt diffuses
into the Paramecium.

Describe the Na+ / K+
pump, labeling the binding sites
for Na+ , K+ , and ATP. Explain how the data indicates
the location of the binding sites for Na+
and K+
on the
pump. Based on the data, choose the correct statement
describing the location of the binding sites for Na+
and
K+
on the pump.
a.
The binding of Na+
occurs on the outer
surface of the cell, as its transportation remains
unaffected by the presence of ouabain. The
binding of K+
occurs on the inner surface of
the cell, as its transportation is blocked when
ouabain is present inside the cell
b.
The binding of K+
occurs on the outer surface
of the cell, as its transportation is blocked when
ouabain is present outside t
