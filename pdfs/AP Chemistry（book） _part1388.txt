at any of the six vertices of the octahedron. The result is always a 
square-pyramidal molecular geometry. When there are two nonbonding electron domains, 
however, their repulsions are minimized by pointing them toward opposite sides of the 
octahedron, producing a square-planar molecular geometry, as shown in Table 9.3.
Use the VSEPR model to predict the molecular geometry of (a) SF4, (b) IF5.
Solve
(a) The Lewis structure for SF4 is:
 
The sulfur has five electron domains around it: four 
from the S Â¬F bonds and one from the nonbonding 
pair. Each domain points toward a vertex of a trigonal 
bipyramid. The domain from the nonbonding pair 
will point toward an equatorial position. The four 
bonds point toward the remaining four positions, 
resulting in a molecular geometry that is described as 
seesaw-shaped:

Analyze The molecules are of the ABn type with a central

Plan We first draw Lewis structures and then use the VSEPR  
model to determine the
