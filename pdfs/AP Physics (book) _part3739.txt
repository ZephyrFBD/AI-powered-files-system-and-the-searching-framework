FIGURE 33–26 Measurements of the cosmic
microwave background radiation over the entire 
sky, color-coded to represent differences in temperature
from the average 2.725 K: the color scale ranges 
from 
(red) to 
(dark blue),
representing slightly hotter and colder spots
(associated with variations in density). Results are
from the WMAP satellite in 2012: the angular
resolution is 0.2°.

FIGURE 33–24 Spectrum of cosmic microwave
background radiation, showing blackbody curve
and experimental measurements including at the
frequency detected by Penzias and Wilson.
(Thanks to G. F. Smoot and D. Scott. The vertical
bars represent the most recent experimental
uncertainty in a measurement.)
