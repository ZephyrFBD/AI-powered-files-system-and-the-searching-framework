ndicates that it is composed of 5.89% H, 70.6% C, and 
23.5% O by mass. What is its molecular formula?
 4.107 Gold is isolated from rocks by reaction with aqueous 
 
cyanide, CN-: 4 Au(s) + 8 NaCN(aq) + O2(g) + H2O(l) ยก  
4 Na[Au(CN)2](aq) + 4 NaOH(aq). (a) Which atoms from 
which compounds are being oxidized, and which at-
oms from which compounds are being reduced? (b) The 
[Au(CN)2]- ion can be converted back to Au(0) by reaction 
with Zn(s) powder. Write a balanced chemical equation 
for this reaction. (c) How many liters of a 0.200 M sodium 
cyanide solution would be needed to react with 40.0 kg of 
rocks that contain 2.00% by mass of gold?
 4.108 A fertilizer railroad car carrying 34,300 gallons of com-
mercial aqueous ammonia (30% ammonia by mass) 
tips over and spills. The density of the aqueous ammo-
nia solution is 0.88 g>cm3. What mass of citric acid, 
C(OH21COOH21CH2COOH22, (which contains three acidic 
protons) is required to neutralize the spill? 1 gallon = 3.785 L.
