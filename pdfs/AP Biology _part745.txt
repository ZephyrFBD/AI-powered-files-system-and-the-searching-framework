BLOOD GROUPS AND TRANSFUSION
ABO antibodies circulate in the plasma of the blood and bind to ABO
antigens on the surface of red blood cells. Giving the wrong blood type to
someone can cause a transfusion reaction or even death. Certain danger
during a transfusion occurs if the recipient’s blood has antibodies to the
donor’s blood antigens. However, before someone receives a transfusion
of blood, two samples of donor and recipient blood must be mixed to
determine compatibility. This procedure is called a cross-match.
