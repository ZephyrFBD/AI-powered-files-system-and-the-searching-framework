rocedure using a plasmid that contains a gene for resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin. If you grow
the bacteria used on agar plates that contain the antibiotic ampicillin, only bacteria that have absorbed the plasmid
will grow on the agar plates.
Heat shock was one of the first techniques used to insert foreign DNA into cells and is a key step in this
investigation. In this lab, bacterial cells are placed in a test tube with a transformation solution and the plasmid
DNA. This tube is then incubated on ice, exposed to a brief heat shock in a water bath, and then returned to the ice.
The cell membrane of a bacterial cell is composed of a phospholipid bilayer. When the cell experiences a heat
shock, temporary microscopic “cracks” are formed in the cell membrane through which the plasmid DNA may
enter. Not all bacteria will take in the plasmid, but manipulating the heat shock under different conditions can lead to
higher or lower numbers of plasmids entering the cells.
If the bacteria
