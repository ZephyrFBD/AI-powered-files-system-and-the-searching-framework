harder to get to, so migration is lower and the
equilibrium number of species is lower. Within island populations, evidence suggests that the number of species gradually
increases to a level similar to the numbers on the mainland from which the species is suspected to have migrated. In
addition, smaller islands are harder to find, so their immigration rates for new species are lower. Smaller islands are also
less geographically diverse so there are fewer niches to promote speciation. And finally, smaller islands support smaller
populations, so the probability of extinction is higher.
As islands get larger, the number of species accelerates, although the effect of island area on species numbers is not a
direct correlation. Conservation preserves can be seen as “islands” of habitat within “an ocean” of non-habitat. For a species
to persist in a preserve, the preserve must be large enough. The critical size depends, in part, on the home range that
is characteristic of the species. A prese
