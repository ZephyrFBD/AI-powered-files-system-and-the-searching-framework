65. In a forest fire, many oak trees were destroyed. After
the fire, numerous taller trees replaced the oak trees. What
is the best explanation of this event?
a.
The tall trees grow faster and create a canopy,
which did not allow oak trees to grow.
b.
The burning of the trees changed the pH of the
soil, which did not allow oak to grow.
c.
Roots of shrubs and trees proliferate, taking over
the place of the oak trees.
d.
Oak trees succumb to pests, thus other pest
resistant trees are able to proliferate.
66. What are possible consequences if there is a big oil
spill in the middle of the ocean? How will it affect the
biodiversity and the net primary productivity? What are
some strategies to clean up this oil spill?
a.
Oil spills increase the amount of light and
oxygen entering the ocean. The phytoplanktons
may perish. Presence of oil would limit mobility
of marine animals and may result in death. Some
chemicals and bioremediation can help oil clean
up.
b.
Oil spills increa
