n chains that make up
hemoglobin (Hb). A trial was conducted. The patient in this trial was
typical of individuals with β-thalassemia. He needed monthly blood
transfusions and daily treatments to lower his blood iron levels. In
2007, when the patient was 19 years old, scientists removed some of
his bone marrow cells and treated them with a modified virus that
was engineered to carry a good copy of the β-globin gene. They
infused the repaired cells into the patient. After several months, the
scientists assessed the patient. Below is a graph of the results of this
trial:

The gene therapy trial failed.
The gene therapy trial was a success, but the patient still
requires blood transfusions.
The scientists transplanted a gene directly into the patient’s red
blood cells.
The scientists inserted a gene into a virus vector that carried the
