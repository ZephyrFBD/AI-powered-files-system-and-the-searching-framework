INTRODUCTION
ell respiration is the means by which cells extract energy stored in
food and transfer that energy to molecules of ATP. Energy that is
temporarily stored in molecules of ATP is instantly available for every
cellular activity such as passing an electrical impulse, contracting a
muscle, moving cilia, or manufacturing a protein. The equation for the
complete aerobic respiration of one molecule of glucose (see below) is a
