solar power? Assume that the solar panels can utilize 20% of
the maximum solar energy that reaches the Earth’s surface
(1000 W m2).

34. (I) What is the range of wavelengths for (a) FM radio (88 MHz
to 108 MHz) and (b) AM radio (535 kHz to 1700 kHz)?
35. (I) Estimate the wavelength for a 1.9-GHz cell phone
transmitter.
36. (I) Compare 980 on the AM dial to 98.1 on FM. Which 
has the longer wavelength, and by what factor is it larger?
37. (I) What are the wavelengths for two TV channels that broad-
cast at 54.0 MHz (Channel 2) and 692 MHz (Channel 51)?

44. Who will hear the voice of a singer first: a person in the
balcony 50.0 m away from the stage (see Fig. 22–21), or a
person 1200 km away at home whose ear is next to the radio
listening to a live broadcast? Roughly how much sooner?
Assume the microphone is a few centimeters from the singer
and the temperature is 20°C.
