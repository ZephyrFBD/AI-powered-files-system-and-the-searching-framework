â–² Figure 23.35 The colors of compounds can arise from charge-transfer transitions. KMnO4 and  
K2CrO4 are colored due to ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transitions in their anions. Higher  
energy ultraviolet photons are needed to excite the charge-transfer transition in the  
perchlorate ion, therefore KClO4 is white.
In the laboratory portion of your course, you have probably seen 
many colorful transition-metal compounds, including those shown 
in Figure 23.35. Many of these compounds are colored because of d-d 
transitions. Some colored complexes, however, including the violet 
permanganate ion, MnO4
-, and the yellow chromate ion, CrO4
2-, 
derive their color from a different type of excitation involving the d 
orbitals.
The permanganate ion strongly absorbs visible light, with a 
maximum absorption at 565 nm. Because violet is complem
