27–3 Photon Theory of Light and
the Photoelectric Effect
In 1905, the same year that he introduced the special theory of relativity, Einstein
made a bold extension of the quantum idea by proposing a new theory of light.
Planck’s work had suggested that the vibrational energy of molecules in a radiat-
ing object is quantized with energy
where n is an integer and f is the
frequency of molecular vibration. Einstein argued that when light is emitted by a
molecular oscillator, the molecule’s vibrational energy of nhf must decrease by an
amount hf (or by 2hf, etc.) to another integer times hf, such as 
Then
to conserve energy, the light ought to be emitted in packets, or quanta, each with
an energy
(27;4)
where f is here the frequency of the emitted light. Again h is Planck’s constant.
Because all light ultimately comes from a radiating source, this idea suggests that
light is transmitted as tiny particles
