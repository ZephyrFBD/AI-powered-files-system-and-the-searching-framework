the processes (say, during expansion of the gases
against a piston) was done so slowly that the process could be considered a series
of equilibrium states, and the whole process could be done in reverse with no
change in the magnitude of work done or heat exchanged. A real process, on the
other hand, would occur more quickly; there would be turbulence in the gas, fric-
tion would be present, and so on. Because of these factors, a real process cannot
be done precisely in reverse—the turbulence would be different and the heat lost
to friction would not reverse itself. Thus, real processes are irreversible.
The isothermal processes of a Carnot engine, where heats 
and 
are
transferred, are assumed to be done at constant temperatures 
and 
. That is,
the system is assumed to be in contact with idealized heat reservoirs (page 414)
which are so large their temperatures don’t change significantly when 
and 
are transferred.
Carnot showed that for an ideal reversible engine, the heats
