nternal energy into the  
system. Conversely, heat transferred out of a system to the surroundings and work done by the  
system on the surroundings are both “withdrawals” of internal energy from the system.
TABLE 5.1 Sign Conventions for q, w, and 횫E
For q
+ means system gains heat
- means system loses heat
For w
+ means work done on system
- means work done by system
For ∆E
+ means net gain of energy by system
- means net loss of energy by system
 
Sample Exercise 5.1 
Relating Heat and Work to Changes of Internal Energy
Gases A(g) and B(g) are confined in a cylinder-and-piston arrangement like that in Figure 5.4 and react to form a solid product 
C(s): A1g2 + B1g2 ¡ C1s2. As the reaction occurs, the system loses 1150 J of heat to the surroundings. The piston moves 
downward as the gases react to form a solid. As the volume of the gas decreases under the constant pressure of the atmosphere, 
the surroundings do 480 J of work on the system. What is the change in the internal energy of
