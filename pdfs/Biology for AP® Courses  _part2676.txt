water to enter the phloem from the xylem. The resulting
positive pressure forces the sucrose-water mixture down toward the roots, where sucrose is unloaded. Transpiration
causes water to return to the leaves through the xylem vessels.
Activity
Based on water’s molecular properties, create a visual diagram/model to illustrate how water travels up a
300-foot California redwood tree through xylem.
Lab Investigation
AP® Biology Investigative Labs: Inquiry-Based, Investigation 11: Transpiration. Design and conduct a series
of experiments to investigate the effects of environmental variables on transpiration rates.
Think About It
Desert travelers claim that cactus juice tastes sweeter during the day than at night. Based on your understanding of
photosynthesis, transpiration, and the regulation of stomata by guard cells in response to environmental conditions, is
there any validity to this claim?
