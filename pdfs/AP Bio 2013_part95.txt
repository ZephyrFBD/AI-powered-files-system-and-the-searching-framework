e higher 
rates of photosynthesis compared to the 550 nm group”) can earn a maximum of 4 points: up to 2 
points for the prediction and up to 2 points for the justification. 
 
(c) Bacteriorhodopsin has been found in aquatic organisms whose ancestors existed before the 
ancestors of plants evolved in the same environment. Propose a possible evolutionary history of 
plants that could have resulted in a predominant photosynthetic system that uses only some of the 
colors of the visible light spectrum. (1 point per box; 2 points maximum) 
Proposal that includes an environmental selective pressure: 
• 
Green light was being absorbed by aquatic organisms using bacteriorhodopsin. 
• 
Unabsorbed wavelengths of light were available resources that organisms could exploit. 
• 
Absorbing visible light at all wavelengths may provide too much energy to the organism. 
• 
Absorbing light from ultraviolet wavelengths (shorter wavelengths = higher energy) could 
cause damage to the organism. 
•
