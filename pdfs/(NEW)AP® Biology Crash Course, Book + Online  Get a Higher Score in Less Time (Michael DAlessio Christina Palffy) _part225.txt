haviors that promote mating): stamping the forefeet, circling the female,
and wing vibration.
•
Female (tend to exhibit behaviors that do not promote mating): ignoring, depressing wings, or
flying.
Exercise 12C:  The Life Cycle of Drosophila
Interpretation of this Exercise
Eggs—small and oval shaped, and usually found on the side of culture tube.
Larval Stage—wormlike stage that tunnel through the medium.
Pupal Stage—fully mature larva are called pupa and tend to be brown in color. Basic body parts can
be observed.
Adult Stage—fly emerges from pupal casing and mating can take place again.
Exercise 12D:  Crosses
Interpretation of this Exercise
Cross 1 monohybrid
•
Assume normal wings is dominant to dumpy (vestigial) wings. Cross a pure breeding long wing
(W+) to a dumpy (vestigial) wing (w).
•
F1 cross: W+W+ X ww → All progeny W+w (all normal wings heterozygotes)
•
F2 cross: W+w x W+w → Progeny 1 W+W+: 2 W+w: 1 ww (3 normal wings: 1 short wing)
Cross 2 dihybrid
•
Assume gray body color
