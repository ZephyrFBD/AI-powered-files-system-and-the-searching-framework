s harder than amorphous silica.
(d) Quartz must have a larger unit cell than amorphous 
silica.
(e) The atoms in amorphous silica do not pack as efficiently 
in three dimensions as compared to the atoms in quartz.
 12.21  Two patterns of packing for two different circles of the same 
size are shown here. For each structure (a) draw the two- 
dimensional unit cell; (b) determine the angle between the 
lattice vectors, g, and determine whether the lattice vectors 
are of the same length or of different lengths; and (c) deter-
mine the type of two-dimensional lattice (from Figure 12.4).
 12.23  Imagine the primitive cubic lattice. Now imagine grabbing 
the top of it and stretching it straight up. All angles remain 
90Â°. What kind of primitive lattice have you made?
