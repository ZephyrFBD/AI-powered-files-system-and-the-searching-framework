 m
tall, this is
above the bottom of the foot.
(b) We use an xy coordinate system, as shown in Fig. 7â€“26b. First, we calculate
how far to the right of the hip joint the CM lies, accounting for all three parts:
For our 1.70-m-tall person, this is 
from the hip joint.
Next, we calculate the distance,
of the CM above the floor:
or
Thus, the CM is located 39 cm above the floor
and 25 cm to the right of the hip joint.
NOTE The CM lies outside the body in (b).
(1.70 m)(23.0100) = 0.39 m.
ycm = (3.4)(1.8) + (9.6)(18.2) + (21.5)(28.5)
3.4 + 9.6 + 21.5
= 23.0 units,
ycm ,
(1.70 m)(14.9100) = 0.25 m
xcm = (21.5)(9.6) + (9.6)(23.6) + (3.4)(23.6)
21.5 + 9.6 + 3.4
= 14.9 units.
(1.70 m)(31.7100) = 0.54 m
52.1 - 20.4 = 31.7 units
= (21.5)(9.6) + (9.6)(33.9) + (3.4)(50.3)
21.5 + 9.6 + 3.4
= 20.4 units.
xcm =
mulxul + mllxll + mfxf
mul + mll + mf

(1.70 m100).

Knowing the CM of the body when it is in various positions is of great use in
studying body mechanics. One simple example f
