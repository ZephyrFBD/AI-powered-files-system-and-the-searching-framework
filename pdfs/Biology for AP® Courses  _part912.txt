autotrophs, can perform photosynthesis. Examples
of photoautotrophs include plants, algae, some unicellular eukaryotes, and cyanobacteria. They require the presence of
chlorophyll, a specialized pigment that absorbs certain wavelengths of the visible light spectrum to harness free energy
from the sun. Photosynthesis is a process where components of water and carbon dioxide are used to assemble carbohydrate
molecules and where oxygen waste products are released into the atmosphere. In eukaryotes, the reactions of photosynthesis
occur in chloroplasts; in prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, the reactions are less localized and occur within membranes
and in the cytoplasm. (The structural features of the chloroplast that participate in photosynthesis will be explored in more
detail later in The Light-Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis and Using Light Energy to Make Organic Molecules.)
Although photosynthesis and cellular respiration evolved as independent processesâ€”with photosynthesis cr
