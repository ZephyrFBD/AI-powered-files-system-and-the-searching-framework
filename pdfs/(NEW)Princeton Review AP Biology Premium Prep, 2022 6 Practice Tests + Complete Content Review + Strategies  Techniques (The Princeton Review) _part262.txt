econd messenger of the hormones epinephrine and glucagon, which
cause energy mobilization. Secondary messengers are usually small molecules that can move quickly through
the cell. They can be made and destroyed quickly and help the signal amplify throughout the cell.
Signal transduction in eukaryotic cells usually involves many steps and complex regulation. Many signal
transduction pathways include protein modifications and phosphorylation cascades, in which a series of protein
kinases add a phosphate group to the next protein in the cascade sequence. In contrast, bacterial cells usually use a
simpler two-component regulatory system in transduction pathways.
Signal transduction cascades are helpful to amplify a signal. They are also helpful in quickly turning a response on
or off, and can lead to important changes in gene expression and cell function.
Mutations in the receptor or the ligand can alter signaling. Drugs that inhibit or excite part of the pathway can also
influence the gen
