on in which
bacteria release signal molecules into the environment to monitor
population density. At high cell densities, bacteria regulate gene
expression to produce the most beneficial phenotypes.
Bacteria reproduce via binary fission, which produces genetically
identical copies of the parent bacterium. Aside from random mutations,
binary fission does not promote genetic recombination or genetic
diversity like sexual reproduction. Genetic variation, which allows
organisms to adapt to changes in their environment, is advantageous for
evolution and survival. Thus, bacteria have evolved mechanisms to
ensure genetic variation and to yield new phenotypes. Transfer of genetic
material from one bacterium to another is called horizontal gene transfer
and can occur via three mechanisms: 1) transformation, 2) transduction,
or 3) conjugation. Bacteria also use transposition to increase genetic
variation. In some bacterial species, the generation time is only a few
minutes, which allows bacteria
