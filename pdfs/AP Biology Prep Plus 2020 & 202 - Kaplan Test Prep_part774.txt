. In plants, to replace water lost via
transpiration from shoots, roots absorb water. In animals, organs in the
digestive system work together to process food, and the digestive system
works in parallel with the excretory system to eliminate undigested
waste.
18.2 Contrast how competition and cooperation aﬀect survival
18.3 Explain environmental and invasive species eﬀects
Contributing to the survival of individuals and the population,
cooperation and competition occur between individuals of the same
species (intraspecific) and/or between individuals of diﬀerent species
(interspecific). Cooperative behavior within a population can provide
protection from predators, acquisition of prey and resources, recognition
of oﬀspring, and transmission of learned responses. Cooperation can be
seen in schools of fish, in which living together decreases the chance of a
predator attack, and among wolves in a pack, in which each wolf has a
specific role in the pack’s hunting strategy.
