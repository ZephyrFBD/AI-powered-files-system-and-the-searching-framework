t not infected, the part of the population that is infected, and the part of 
the population that has recovered from the disease. The probability of transmitting the 
infection and the probability for recovery are important parameters to define as well. 
The next step would be to graphically define these parameters and their relation to one 
another, as you did previously (see Figure 3). 
With this graphic, you can imagine word equations that step through the process of 
a disease cycle in a population. These word equations can then be interpreted into the 
language of a spreadsheet to get something like Figure 4.

Wet lab investigation: laboratories in which chemicals, drugs, or other material or biological matter 
are tested and analyzed requiring water, direct ventilation, and specialized piped utilities, as opposed 
to a computer-based lab.
