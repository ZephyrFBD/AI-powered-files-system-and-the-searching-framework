Multiple-Choice Section
In Section I there are 63 multiple-choice questions. These questions represent 
the knowledge and skills students should know, understand, and be able to apply. 
Section I also includes 6 grid-in questions that require the integration of science 
and mathematical skills. For the grid-in responses, students will need to calculate 
the answer for each question and enter it in the grid on the answer sheet provided. 
Note: For this practice exam and publication, the grids included on the answer 
sheet have been modified. The sample grids below are more representative of what 
students will actually see on the AP Biology Exam answer sheet.
