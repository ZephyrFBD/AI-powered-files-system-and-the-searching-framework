esis in the control plants = 400 microliters oxygen/30 minutes = 13.3 microliters

Rate of photosynthesis in the plants with the mutation = 100 microliters oxygen/30 minutes = 3.3 microliters
oxygen/minute
(d) The plants grown under light with a wavelength of 550 nm will perform the least amount of photosynthesis
because carotenoids absorb the least amount of light energy at 550 nm. The absorbance is greater at 450 nm
and 500 nm than it is at 550 nm, so less photosynthesis will occur at 550 nm.

Overview
Chapter 8 reviewed how photosynthetic organisms harness light energy and store it in the chemical bonds of organic
molecules. This chapter will review how living organisms release the energy stored in the chemical bonds of organic
molecules to drive the processes necessary for life.
