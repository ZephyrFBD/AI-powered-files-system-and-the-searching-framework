optimal pH and compartmentalization of lysosomal enzymes prevent the
rest of the cellular contents from degrading.
PEROXISOMES
Peroxisomes contain oxidative enzymes that catalyze reactions in which
hydrogen peroxide is produced and degraded. Peroxisomes break fats
down into small molecules that can be used for fuel; they are also used in
the liver to detoxify compounds, such as alcohol, that may be harmful to
the body. The peroxides produced in the peroxisome would be hazardous
to the cell if present in the cytoplasm, because these molecules are highly
reactive and could covalently alter molecules such as DNA.
Compartmentalization of these activities within the peroxisome reduces
this risk.
MITOCHONDRIA
Mitochondria are the source of most energy in the eukaryotic cell as the
site of aerobic respiration. Mitochondria are bound by an outer and inner
phospholipid bilayer membrane. The outer membrane has many pores
and acts as a sieve, allowing molecules through on the basis of their size.
