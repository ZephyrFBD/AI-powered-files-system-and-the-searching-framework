6. Suppose we discovered that several thousand years ago
cosmic rays had bombarded the Earthâ€™s atmosphere a lot

7. In 1991, the frozen remains of a Neolithic-age man, nick-
named Otzi, were found in the Italian Alps by hikers. The
body was well preserved, as were his bow, arrows, knife,
axe, other tools, and clothing. The date of his death can be
determined using carbon-14 dating. (a) What is the decay
constant for 
(b) How many 
atoms per gram of
are there in a living organism? (c) What is the activity
per gram in naturally occurring carbon for a living organ-
ism? (d) For Otzi, the activity per gram of carbon was
measured to be 0.121. How long ago did he live?

than the age of the universe (lik
