 C is in column 4A, and so 
has four valence electrons. Therefore, As, if doped into silicon, 
would yield an n-type semiconductor.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of these doped semiconductors would yield a p-type 
material? (These choices are written as host atom:dopant 
atom.)
(a) Ge:P (b) Si:Ge (c) Si:Al (d) Ge:S (e) Si:N
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Compound semiconductors can be doped to make n-type and 
p-type materials, but the scientist has to make sure that the 
proper atoms are substituted. For example, if Ge were doped 
into GaAs, Ge could substitute for Ga, making an n-type semi-
conductor; but if Ge substituted for As, the material would be 
p-type. Suggest a way to dope CdSe to create a p-type material.
