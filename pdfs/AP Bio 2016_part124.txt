researchers used these data to calculate a host-
preference index for each form, as shown in Figure 2. Researchers also identified a gene in the 
mosquitoes, OR4, that encodes an olfactory receptor. A volatile odorant, sulcatone, binds to the OR4 
receptor. Humans produce higher levels of sulcatone than do guinea pigs. 
 
(a) Based on an analysis of the data, identify the preferred host of the forest form and of the domestic 
form of the mosquito. (2 points) 
 
Identification (2 points) 
• 
Forest mosquitoes prefer guinea pig 
• 
Domestic mosquitoes prefer human hosts  
 
(b) Propose a refinement to the initial experimental design that will rule out the possibility that 
preference is based on a visual cue. Propose a different refinement to the initial experiment to test 
whether sulcatone is the attractant for the human-preferring form. (2 points)

• Use a dark/no light box  
• Cover the guinea pig/hand 
• Use guinea pig/hand models 
• Stop movement of
