l phone and music! However, if you’re pressed for time and
cannot spend the full three hours on each test, take one section of
each test at a time (i.e., set aside 90 minutes and just complete
Section I of Practice Test 1; then, when you have more time, set
aside another 90 minutes and just complete Section II of Practice
Test 1). Whichever method you choose, be sure to complete the
entire practice test before reviewing the answer explanations.
Review those answer explanations closely to see what topics you
are solid on and what topics you may want to go back and review
once more before test day.
Note that, on the actual exam, you will be provided with the
official “AP Biology Equations and Formulas” sheet, which can
be found on the College Board’s AP Biology website. For
convenience, you can find those equations and formulas in
Appendix C of this book.
