e distinct outcomes. Mitotic divisions are single nuclear divisions that
produce daughter nuclei that are genetically identical and have the same number of chromosome sets as the original cell.
Meiotic divisions include two nuclear divisions that produce four daughter nuclei that are genetically different and have
one chromosome set instead of the two sets of chromosomes in the parent cell. The main differences between the
processes occur in the first division of meiosis, in which homologous chromosomes are paired and exchange non-sister
chromatid segments. The homologous chromosomes separate into different nuclei during meiosis I, causing a reduction of
ploidy level in the first division. The second division of meiosis is more similar to a mitotic division, except that the
daughter cells do not contain identical genomes because of crossover.
11.2 Sexual Reproduction
Nearly all eukaryotes undergo sexual reproduction. The variation introduced into the reproductive cells by meiosis appea
