opment. Many
infectious diseases, such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, and tetanus, were conquered by the use of
vaccines.
Immunologists are the physicians and scientists who research and develop vaccines, as well as treat and
study allergies or other immune problems. Some immunologists study and treat autoimmune problems
(diseases in which a person’s immune system attacks his or her own cells or tissues, such as lupus) and
immunodeficiencies, whether acquired (by a virus, for example) or hereditary (such as severe combined
immunodeficiency, or SCID). Immunologists are called in to help treat organ transplantation patients, who
must have their immune systems suppressed so that their bodies will not reject a transplanted organ. Some
immunologists work to understand natural immunity and the effects of a person’s environment on it. Others
work on questions about how the immune system affects the development of certain chronic diseases.
To work as an immunologist, a PhD or MD is required.
