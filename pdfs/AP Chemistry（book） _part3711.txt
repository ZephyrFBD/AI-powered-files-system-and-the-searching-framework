CHAPTER 23 Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry
When an object absorbs some portion of the visible spectrum, the color we perceive 
is the sum of the unabsorbed portions, which are either reflected or transmitted by the 
object and strike our eyes. (Opaque objects reflect light, and transparent ones transmit it.) 
If an object absorbs all wavelengths of visible light, none reaches our eyes and the object 
appears black. If it absorbs no visible light, it is white if opaque or colorless if transparent. 
If it absorbs all but orange light, the orange light is what reaches our eye and therefore is 
the color we see.
An interesting phenomenon of vision is that we also perceive an orange color when 
an object absorbs only the blue portion of the visible spectrum and all the other colors 
strike our eyes. This is because orange and blue are complementary colors, which 
means that the removal of blue from white light makes the light look orange
