y in detecting it, was assumed to have zero density.
§Also, it appeared that Maxwell’s equations did not satisfy the relativity principle: They were simplest
in the frame where 
, in a reference frame at rest in the ether. In any other
reference frame, extra terms were needed to account for relative velocity. Although other laws of 
physics obeyed the relativity principle, the laws of electricity and magnetism apparently did not.
Einstein’s second postulate (next Section) resolved this problem: Maxwell’s equations do satisfy 
relativity.

26–2 Postulates of the 
Special Theory of Relativity
The problems that existed at the start of the twentieth century with regard to
electromagnetic theory and Newtonian mechanics were beautifully resolved by
Einstein’s introduction of the special theory of relativity in 1905. Unaware of the
Michelson–Morley null result, Einstein was motivated by certain questions
regarding electromagnetic theory and light waves. For example, he asked
