0% FBS and
dexamethasone were clustered around two means for
each measured period.
A. Based on these data, describe the connections between
the circadian period and the cell cycle period for each of
the experimental conditions.
B. Based on these data, justify the claim that in cells that
are actively dividing, the circadian period is set by the cell
cycle period rather than the reverse.
45. Cells in different tissues of a fully developed human
show significant variations in the length of time that they
remain in the G0 phase of the cell cycle: muscle (lifetime),
nerve (lifetime), adipose (years), liver (year), erythrocyte
(months), bone osteoclasts (weeks), leukocyte (days), and
epidermal (hours). For each of these types of tissues,
propose a reason based on internal and external factors
and function that might account for the differences among
their longevities.
46. Describe the essential components and results of
mitosis and the activities that occur during interphase to
prepare the
