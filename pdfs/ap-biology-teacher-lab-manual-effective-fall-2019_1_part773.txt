can 
break down gelatin and is often an ingredient in commercial meat marinades. Papain is 
an enzyme that comes from papaya and is used in some teeth whiteners to break down 
the bacterial film on teeth. People who are lactose intolerant cannot digest milk sugar 
(lactose); they can take supplements containing lactase, the enzyme they are missing. 
All of these enzymes hydrolyze large, complex molecules into their simpler components; 
bromelain and papain break proteins down to amino acids, while lactase breaks lactose 
down to simpler sugars.

Anabolic enzymes are equally vital to all living systems. One example is ATP synthase, 
the enzyme that stores cellular energy in ATP by combining ADP and phosphate. 
Another example is rubisco, an enzyme involved in the anabolic reactions of building 
sugar molecules in the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis. 
To begin this investigation, students will focus on a specific enzyme, peroxidase, 
which is obtained from turni
