ones—those that have nodes at the
ends—are sustained. These are the resonant modes of the string. Waves with
other wavelengths interfere with themselves upon reflection and their amplitudes
quickly drop to zero. With electrons moving in circles, according to Bohr’s theory,
de Broglie argued that the electron wave was a circular standing wave that closes
on itself, Fig. 27–30a. If the wavelength of a wave does not close on itself, as in 
Fig. 27–30b, destructive interference takes place as the wave travels around the
loop, and the wave quickly dies out. Thus, the only waves that persist are those for
which the circumference of the circular orbit contains a whole number of wave-
lengths, Fig. 27–31. The circumference of a Bohr orbit of radius 
is 
so to
have constructive interference, we need
When we substitute 
we get 
or
This is just the quantum condition proposed by Bohr on an ad hoc basis, Eq. 27–11.
It is from this equation that the discrete orbits and energy levels were derived.
