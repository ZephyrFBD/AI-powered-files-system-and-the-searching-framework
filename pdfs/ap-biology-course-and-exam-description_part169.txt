Construct an Argument  
Students develop a skit to demonstrate the process of translation. Once they have an 
understanding of the process, challenge them to act out what might happen if there were a 
change in the DNA sequence or if one of the needed components was unavailable. Debrief 
by having students explain the rationale for the modifications they made in their skit.
