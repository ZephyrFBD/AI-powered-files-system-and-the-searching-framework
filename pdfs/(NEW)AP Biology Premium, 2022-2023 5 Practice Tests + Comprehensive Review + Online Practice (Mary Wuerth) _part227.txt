appens during fermentation, not
cellular respiration, so choice (D) is incorrect.
8. (C) The electron transport chain and ATP synthase are both located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria.
Choices (A), (B), and (D) do not list the correct location and are therefore incorrect.
9. (B) In cellular respiration, the electrons in glucose are transferred to NAD+ to form NADH. NADH then
delivers these electrons to the electron transport chain. At the end of the electron transport chain, oxygen
accepts these electrons (along with protons) to form water. Choice (A) is incorrect because the final electron
acceptor in cellular respiration is oxygen, not NAD+. In cellular respiration, pyruvate is formed prior to
electrons entering the electron transport chain, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because carbon
dioxide does not receive electrons during cellular respiration.
10. (D) If electrons could not travel down the electron transport chain, a proton gradient would not be p
