and help return it to its normal body temperature. Another example
of negative feedback is the control of blood glucose levels by insulin and glucagon. After a sugary snack, if blood
sugar levels get too high, the pancreas releases the ligand (hormone) insulin, which causes body cells to absorb
glucose from the blood, returning blood glucose levels to the normal range. Conversely, if blood sugar levels get too
low, the pancreas releases the ligand (hormone) glucagon, which stimulates liver cells to break down glycogen into
glucose, releasing glucose into the blood and again returning blood glucose levels to the normal range. Since insulin
and glucagon travel long distances in the bloodstream, this is an example of endocrine signaling.
Positive feedback magnifies cell processes. For example, the hormone oxytocin stimulates contractions of the
uterine muscles in labor contractions during childbirth. The contraction of the uterine muscles triggers the
production of even more oxytocin, whi
