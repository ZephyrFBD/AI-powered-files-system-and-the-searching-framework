(a) The force between two quarks holding them together as part of a proton, for
example, is carried by a gluon, which in this case involves a change in color. (b) Strong interaction
with the exchange of a charged 
meson (
or 
depending on whether it is
considered moving to the left or to the right). (c) Quark representation of the same interaction
The blue coiled lines between quarks represent gluon exchanges holding the
hadrons together. (The exchanged meson may be regarded as 
emitted by the n and absorbed by
the p, or as 
emitted by p and absorbed by n, because a u (or d) quark going to the left in the
diagram is equivalent to a 
(or ) going to the right.)

Gluon
The particles that transmit the color force (analogous to photons for the EM force)
are called gluons (a play on “glue”). They are included in Tables 32–2 and 32–5.
There are eight gluons, ac
