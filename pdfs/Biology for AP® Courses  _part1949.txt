44. In separating DNA for genomic analysis, it is
important to consider RNA contaminating the sample
during the cell lysis step of a DNA extraction. Which is
likely to cause what to occur?
a.
DNA separates into the supernatant.
b.
DNA is destroyed by the protease.
c.
DNA is unaffected by the RNA.
d.
DNA combines with the RNA.
45. There are many techniques for investigating human
genomic disorders. Western blotting looks for protein,
Eastern blotting looks for post-translational changes,
Northern blotting looks at mRNA, and Southern blotting
looks at DNA. If you were to look at sickle cell anemia, a
disorder affecting hemoglobin produced in red blood cells,
which technique would be the most useful in detecting
polymorphism in a sample?
a.
Northern blotting
b.
Southern blotting
c.
Western blotting
d.
Eastern blotting
