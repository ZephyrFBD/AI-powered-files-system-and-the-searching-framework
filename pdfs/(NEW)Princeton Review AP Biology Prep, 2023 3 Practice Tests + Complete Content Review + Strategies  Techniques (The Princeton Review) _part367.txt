ng bacteria foreign DNA is called transformation.
Not only has this laboratory technique been used to safely mass-produce important proteins used for medicine, such
as insulin, but it also plays an important role in the study of gene expression. A technique similar to transformation
is transfection, which is putting a plasmid into a eukaryotic cell, rather than a bacteria cell. This is a bit trickier than
transformation. Because eukaryotic cells do not grow like bacteria do, transfection is not as useful for making large
quantities of something, but sometimes it is important to use eukaryotic cells.
Gel Electrophoresis
An important part of DNA technology is the ability to observe differences in different preparations of DNA.
DNA fragments can be separated according to their molecular weight and charge with gel electrophoresis. Because
DNA and RNA are negatively charged, they migrate through a gel toward the positive pole of the electrical field.
The smaller the fragments, the faster th
