mata. This makes perfect
sense, as the guard cells allow transpiration when there is plenty of water
in the leaves and water conservation when there is not. Guard cells
absorb water in response to potassium ions that are driven into the cells.
Water follows these ions due to the osmotic gradient that is created by
the presence of extra particles inside the cell as compared with outside
the cell.
The presence of blue-light receptors on the guard cell membranes is what
drives the movement of K+ into the guard cell. Sunlight, particularly blue

wavelengths, causes K+ ion channels to open and potassium to flood in.
This explains why guard cells are usually open during the day and closed
at night, helping photosynthesis to take place as carbon dioxide gas can
then enter through the open stomata.
Growth in higher plants is restricted to areas of perpetually embryonic
and undiï¬€erentiated tissue known as meristems. Meristems are self-
renewing populations of cells that divide and
