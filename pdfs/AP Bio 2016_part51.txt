ars 
migrate to the rivers and deposit nitrogen 
from the forest with their excrement. 
(C) Bears are a reservoir for nitrogen because 
they are the top consumer in the 
environment. 
(D) Bears urinate in rivers and streams, which 
provides nitrogen for the salmon. 
8. Which of the following pieces of additional data
would help further investigate the relationship
between bears, salmon, and influx of nitrogen into
the local environment?
(A) The experimenters should remove the
remains of salmon carcasses immediately 
after the salmon are eaten by the bears and 
determine the nitrogen content of the 
carcasses. 
(B) The experimenters should increase the 
number of bears in the area and measure the 
amount of nitrogen available for uptake by 
plants. 
(C) The experimenters should set up a net to 
catch salmon before they enter the area and 
then measure nitrogen influx. 
(D) The experimenters should clear-cut the trees 
from the area and determine how much 
nitrogen remains in the streams
