rmined by the amount of skeletal system it needs in order to support the
other tissues and the amount of muscle it needs for movement. As the body size increases, both bone and muscle mass
increase. The speed achievable by the animal is a balance between its overall size and the bone and muscle that provide
support and movement.
Limiting Effects of Diffusion on Size and Development
The exchange of nutrients and wastes between a cell and its watery environment occurs through the process of diffusion. All
living cells are bathed in liquid, whether they are in a single-celled organism or a multicellular one. Diffusion is effective
over a specific distance and limits the size that an individual cell can attain. If a cell is a single-celled microorganism, such
as an amoeba, it can satisfy all of its nutrient and waste needs through diffusion. If the cell is too large, then diffusion is
ineffective and the center of the cell does not receive adequate nutrients nor is it able to effectively d
