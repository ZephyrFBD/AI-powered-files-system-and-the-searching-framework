repay the oxygen debt. With normal
oxygen levels, the muscle cells will revert to the more efficient aerobic
respiration and the lactic acid is then converted back to pyruvate in the
liver.
CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter supported Big Ideas: EVO, ENE, and SYI.
All living things require a constant input of energy.
There are a lot of interconnected pathways in this chapter. As you
learn them, keep your thoughts on the big picture—energy capture
and transfer. In Chapter 12, “Ecology,” we will tie concepts from
this chapter with energy flowing through an entire ecosystem.
ATP is important because it stores energy for immediate use.
Exergonic means release of energy: A + B → AB + energy.
Endergonic means absorbing energy: A + B + energy → AB.
Glycolysis is the first phase of cellular respiration. It does not use
oxygen to break down 1 glucose molecule into 2 molecules of
pyruvate with the release of 4 ATP. This ATP is produced by
