positive charge; (b) 45° above the axis but nearer the positive
charge; (c) 45° above the axis but nearer the negative charge.
*34. (III) The dipole moment, considered as a vector, points from
the negative to the positive charge. The water molecule,
Fig. 17–42, has a dipole moment 
which can be considered
as the vector sum of the two dipole moments,
and 
as
shown. The distance between each H and the O is about
The lines joining the center of the O atom
with each H atom make an angle of 104°, as shown, and the
net dipole moment has been mea-
sured to be
