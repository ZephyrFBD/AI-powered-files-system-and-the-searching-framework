or a typical retrovirus, 
such as HIV, which uses RNA as genetic material, 
the genetic variation in the resulting population of 
new virus particles is very high because of 
(A) damage to the virus particle from envelope 
loss during infection 
(B) errors introduced in the DNA molecule 
through reverse transcription 
(C) errors in the protein molecules produced in 
translation 
(D) recombination of the genomes of free virus 
particles

23. A sample of human blood was placed in a test tube containing a physiological saline solution (0.9% sodium 
chloride). This type of solution is often used intravenously to quickly rehydrate patients. A drop of the blood 
from the test tube was placed on a slide and red blood cells (RBCs) were observed under a microscope. Three 
possible outcomes are diagrammed below. 
 
 
 
  Which of the following best predicts which diagrammed microscope view the laboratory worker would see and 
best explains why?
