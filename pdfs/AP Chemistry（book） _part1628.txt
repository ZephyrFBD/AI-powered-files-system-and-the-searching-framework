Real Gases: Deviations  
from Ideal Behavior
The extent to which a real gas departs from ideal behavior can be seen by rearranging the 
ideal-gas equation to solve for n:
 
PV
RT = n 
[10.24]
This form of the equation tells us that for 1 mol of ideal gas, the quantity PV>RT equals 
1 at all pressures. In Figure 10.18, PV>RT is plotted as a function of P for 1 mol of several 
real gases. At high pressures (generally above 10 atm), the deviation from ideal behavior

the behavior of several real gases. Data 
for 1 mol of gas in all cases. Data for 
N2, CH4, and H2 are at 300 K; for CO2 data 
are at 313 K because under high pressure 
CO2 liquefies at 300 K.
