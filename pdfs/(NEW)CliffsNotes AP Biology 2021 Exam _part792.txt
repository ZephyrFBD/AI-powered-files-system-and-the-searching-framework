ormation) by giving the bacteria a heat-shock (short pulse of heat).
5. Incubate both tubes overnight to allow for the growth of bacterial colonies. Then, transfer bacteria from one of the
tubes to an agar plate with ampicillin and to an agar plate without ampicillin. Repeat for the second tube.
6. Record your results in a table (Table 17-2).
7. Interpret you results: Only bacteria transformed with pAMP plasmids can grow in the presence of ampicillin and
form colonies. The control tube of bacteria confirms that without pAMP, growth cannot occur in the presence of
ampicillin. It also confirms that the untransformed E. coli are not ampicillin resistant.

Part II: Determine Transformation Efficiency
The transformation efficiency is a quantitative measurement of the effectiveness of the DNA transfer procedure. It is
defined as follows:
 
Each colony of bacteria on a plate is a population that began with the reproduction of a single bacterium. So the
number of colonies is equivale
