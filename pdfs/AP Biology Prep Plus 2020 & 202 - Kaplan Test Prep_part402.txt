robic process; oxygen acts as the
final acceptor of electrons that are passed from carrier to carrier during
the final stage of glucose oxidation. The metabolic reactions of cellular
respiration occur in the eukaryotic mitochondria and are catalyzed by
reaction-specific enzymes.
General Overview of Cellular Respiration
Cellular respiration can be divided into five stages: glycolysis,
fermentation, pyruvate decarboxylation, the citric acid cycle, and the
electron transport chain.
GLYCOLYSIS
The first stage of glucose catabolism is glycolysis. Glycolysis is a series of
reactions that lead to the oxidative breakdown of glucose into two
molecules of pyruvate (the ionized form of pyruvic acid), the production
of ATP, and the reduction of NAD+ into NADH. All of these reactions occur
in the cytoplasm and are mediated by specific enzymes. The glycolytic
pathway is as follows:
