Note carefully that the law of universal gravitation describes a particular
force (gravity), whereas Newton’s second law of motion
tells how an
object accelerates due to any type of force.
5–6 Gravity Near the Earth’s Surface
When Eq. 5–4 is applied to the gravitational force between the Earth and an
object at its surface,

becomes the mass
of the object m, and r becomes the distance of the object from the Earth’s center,
which is the radius of the Earth
