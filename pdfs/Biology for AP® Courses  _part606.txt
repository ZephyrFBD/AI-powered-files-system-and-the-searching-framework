re of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed
low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as “bad” cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptor-mediated
endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing
entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear
LDL particles from their blood.
Although receptor-mediated endocytosis is designed to bring specific substances that are normally found in the extracellular
fluid into the cell, other substances may gain entry into the cell at the same site. Flu viruses, diphtheria, and cholera toxin
all have sites that cross-react with normal receptor-binding sites and gain entry into cells.
