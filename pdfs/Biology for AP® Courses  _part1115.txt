omosomal Structure and Compaction
If the DNA from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately
two meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm. Considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 µm
(100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), DNA must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell’s nucleus. At the same time, it
must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. During some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of DNA
are condensed into compact chromosomes. There are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted.
In the first level of compaction, short stretches of the DNA double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins
at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome (Figure 10.4). The DNA-histone complex is part of the
chromatin. Each beadlike histone-DNA complex is called a nucleosome, and DNA connecting the nucleosomes is called
linker DNA. A DNA molecule in thi
