levation at which
an organism is found. Ocean upwelling and spring and fall turnovers are important processes regulating the distribution of
nutrients and other abiotic factors important in aquatic ecosystems. Energy sources, temperature, water, inorganic
nutrients, and soil are factors limiting the distribution of living things in terrestrial systems. Net primary productivity is a
measure of the amount of biomass produced by a biome.
35.3 Terrestrial Biomes
The Earth has terrestrial biomes and aquatic biomes. Aquatic biomes include both freshwater and marine environments.
There are eight major terrestrial biomes: tropical wet forests, savannas, subtropical deserts, chaparral, temperate
grasslands, temperate forests, boreal forests, and Arctic tundra. The same biome can occur in different geographic
locations with similar climates. Temperature and precipitation, and variations in both, are key abiotic factors that shape the
composition of animal and plant communities in terrestrial bio
