is quantity of H2 occupy at STP? (c) If this quantity 
of hydrogen was combusted in air to produce liquid water, 
how much energy could be produced?
 [22.92]  Using the thermochemical data in Table 22.1 and Appen-
dix C, calculate the average Xe¬ F bond enthalpies in 
XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6, respectively. What is the signiﬁcance 
of the trend in these quantities?
 22.93  Hydrogen gas has a higher fuel value than natural gas on 
a mass basis but not on a volume basis. Thus, hydrogen is 
not competitive with natural gas as a fuel transported long 
distances through pipelines. Calculate the heats of com-
bustion of H2 and CH4 (the principal component of natural 
gas) (a) per mole of each, (b) per gram of each, (c) per cubic 
meter of each at STP
. Assume H2O1l2 as a product.
 22.94  Using ∆G °
f for ozone from Appendix C, calculate the equi-
librium constant for Equation 22.22 at 298.0 K, assuming 
no electrical input.
 22.95  The solubility of Cl2 in 100 g of water at STP is 310 cm3.
