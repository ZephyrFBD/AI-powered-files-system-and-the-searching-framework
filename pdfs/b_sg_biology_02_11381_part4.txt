“attacks” bacteria, bacteria decline while virus multiplies) 
• 
recovery phase (resistant mutant/immune bacteria survive to reproduce, virus number drops) 
• 
co-existence phase (viruses multiply only in non-resistant/“sensitive” cells or lysogenic situation 
develops) 
• 
exceptional description of a particular phase 
• 
population reaches an equilibrium 
 
 
1. (b) 
Discuss the infection cycle of a DNA virus from attachment to lysis (4 points maximum) 
 
• 
attachment to host cell (cell wall, membrane, etc., attachment to something) 
• 
penetration/injection of DNA/nucleic acid 
• 
synthesis of viral components (nucleic acids and/or proteins) 
• 
assembly/packaging of viruses 
• 
lysis (release, budding); needs details beyond simply cells burst/lysed 
 
 
1. (c) 
Describe how the genome of a retrovirus like HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) becomes  
incorporated into the genome of the host cell.  (4 points maximum) 
 
• 
retrovirus = RNA virus 
• 
use of reverse transcriptase (enz
