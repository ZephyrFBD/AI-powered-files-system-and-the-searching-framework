56. Packing material made of pieces of foamed polystyrene can
easily become charged and stick to each other. Given that
the density of this material is about 
estimate
how much charge might be on a 2.0-cm-diameter foamed
polystyrene sphere, assuming the electric force between two
spheres stuck together is equal to the weight of one sphere.
57. A point charge 
at the end of an insulating
cord of length 55 cm is observed to be in equilibrium in a
uniform horizontal electric field of 
when the
pendulum’s position is as shown in Fig. 16–66, with the
charge 12 cm above the lowest
(vertical) position. If the field
points to the right in Fig. 16–66,
determine the magnitude and
sign of the point charge.
