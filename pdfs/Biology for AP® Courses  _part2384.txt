The content described in this section is outside the scope for AP®. However, it’s interesting to note that prions and
viroids—pathogens that are far simpler in structure than viruses—can produce deadly diseases, including mad cow disease
and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Prions are infectious proteins, whereas viroids are single-stranded RNA pathogens (agents
with the ability to cause disease) that infect plants.
Prions
Prions, so-called because they are proteinaceous, are infectious particles—smaller than viruses—that contain no nucleic
acids (neither DNA nor RNA). Historically, the idea of an infectious agent that did not use nucleic acids was considered
impossible, but pioneering work by
