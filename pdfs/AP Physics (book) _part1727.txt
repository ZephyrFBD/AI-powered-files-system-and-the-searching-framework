This process is called charging by
conduction, or “by contact,” and the two objects end up with the same sign of
charge.
Now suppose a positively charged object is brought close to a neutral metal
rod, but does not touch it. Although the free electrons of the metal rod do not leave
the rod, they still move within the metal toward the external positive charge,
leaving a positive charge at the opposite end of the rod (Fig.16–7b). A charge is said
to have been induced at the two ends of the metal rod. No net charge has been created
in the rod: charges have merely been separated. The net charge on the metal rod
is still zero. However, if the metal is separated into two pieces, we would have two
charged objects: one charged positively and one charged negatively. This is
charging by induction.
