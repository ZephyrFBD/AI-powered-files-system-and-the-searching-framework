Figure 23.23 Leaves may be simple or compound. In simple leaves, the lamina is continuous. The (a) banana plant
(Musa sp.) has simple leaves. In compound leaves, the lamina is separated into leaflets. Compound leaves may be
palmate or pinnate. In (b) palmately compound leaves, such as those of the horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum),
the leaflets branch from the petiole. In (c) pinnately compound leaves, the leaflets branch from the midrib, as on a scrub
hickory (Carya floridana). The (d) honey locust has double compound leaves, in which leaflets branch from the veins.
