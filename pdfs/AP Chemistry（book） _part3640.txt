rvest horseshoe crabs, attach them to machines that drain 
off roughly 30% of their blood, and then return them to the ocean. 
The LAL that is extracted from the blood can sell for up to $15,000 per 
quart. Most animals survive the ordeal, the mortality rate is estimated 
987
Humans, like all vertebrates, have 
 
red blood. The red color is due to an iron-
containing protein called hemoglobin found in 
red blood cells. Hemoglobin is responsible for 
binding oxygen in the lungs and transporting it to 
cells throughout the body.
