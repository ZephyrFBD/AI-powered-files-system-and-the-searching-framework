ight from a
tungsten–halogen bulb is incident on a diffraction grating
with slit spacing d and that the first-order brightness maxi-
mum for the wavelength of 1200 nm occurs at angle 
What
other wavelengths within the spectrum of incident light will
produce a brightness maximum at this same angle 
[Optical
filters are used to deal with this bothersome effect when a
continuous spectrum of light is measured by a spectrometer.]
94. At what angle above the horizon is the Sun when light
reflecting off a smooth lake is polarized most strongly?
95. Unpolarized light falls on two polarizer sheets whose axes
are at right angles. (a) What fraction of the incident light
intensity is transmitted? (b) What fraction is transmitted if
a third polarizer is placed between the first two so that its
axis makes a 56° angle with the axis of the first polarizer?
(c) What if the third polarizer is in front of the other two?
96. At what angle should the axes of two Polaroids be placed
so as to reduce the inte
