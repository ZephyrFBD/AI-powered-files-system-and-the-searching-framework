question with a specific 
goal that can, in fact, be 
answered within a minute

Functions as a formative 
assessment technique.
Give students one minute to 
respond to a prompt such 
as “Explain the relationship 
between photosynthesis at the 
cellular level and environmental 
carbon cycling.”
QuickWrite
Writing for a short, specific 
amount of time about a 
designated topic related to 
a text.
Generates multiple ideas 
in a quick fashion that 
could be turned into longer 
pieces of writing at a later 
time (may be considered 
as part of the drafting 
process).
Prior to teaching about water 
and why it is so important as 
a biological molecule, ask 
students to take a few minutes 
to explain why they think 
water exhibits the properties 
of cohesion and adhesion. At 
the conclusion of the lesson, 
students can revisit their 
answer and revise it to reflect 
on what they have learned.
