other than those captured by chlorophyll a. Antenna pigments absorb
photons of light and pass the energy along to chlorophyll a, which is
directly involved in the transformation of light energy to sugars. Figure 7.1
is a graph that shows the absorption spectrum for photosynthetic pigments
that were extracted from a leaf.
INTERPRETING THIS GRAPH
Chlorophyll a absorbs light in the violet, blue, and red ranges. It reflects green, yellow, and

from a Leaf
Figure 7.2 is an action spectrum with wavelengths of light plotted
against rate of photosynthesis. The data are obtained from a living plantâ€”
not from isolated photosynthetic pigment as in the absorption spectrum
above. This figure is different from Figure 7.1 because Figure 7.2 includes
data from all photosynthetic pigments in the plants: chlorophyll a,
chlorophyll b, and carotenoids.
