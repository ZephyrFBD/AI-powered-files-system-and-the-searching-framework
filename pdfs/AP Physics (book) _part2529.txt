the left of the image, so that some of the rays diverging from each point on the image
(as point ) can enter the eye as shown in Fig.23–15c (just as in Figs.23–1 and 23–7).

derivation, we assume the mirror 
size is small compared to its radius 
of curvature.
Mirror Equation and Magnification
Image points can be determined, roughly, by drawing the three rays as just described,
Fig. 23–15. But it is difficult to draw small angles for the “paraxial” rays as we
assumed. For more accurate results, we now derive an equation that gives the image
distance if the object distance and radius of curvature of the mirror are known.
To do this, we refer to Fig.23–16. The object distance,
is the distance of the object
(point O) from the center of the mirror. The image distance,
is the distance of
the image (point I) from the center of the m
