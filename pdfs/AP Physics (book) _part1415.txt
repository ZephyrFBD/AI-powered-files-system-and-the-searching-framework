inverse relationship as given by
Boyle’s law: as the pressure
decreases, the volume increases.
Why you should not put a closed glass
jar into a campfire. What could happen if you tossed an empty glass jar, with 
the lid on tight, into a fire, and why?
RESPONSE The inside of the jar is not empty. It is filled with air. As the fire
heats the air inside, its temperature rises. The volume of the glass jar changes
only slightly due to the heating. According to Gay-Lussac’s law
