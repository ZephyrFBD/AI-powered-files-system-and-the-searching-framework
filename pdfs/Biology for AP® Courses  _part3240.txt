 onto the hand, and when motion has stopped, water may splash forward onto the fingers. While in
motion, the water settles in the glass and does not splash. Note that the canals are not sensitive to velocity itself, but to
changes in velocity, so moving forward at 60mph with your eyes closed would not give the sensation of movement, but
suddenly accelerating or braking would stimulate the receptors.
Higher Processing
Hair cells from the utricle, saccule, and semicircular canals also communicate through bipolar neurons to the cochlear
nucleus in the medulla. Cochlear neurons send descending projections to the spinal cord and ascending projections to
the pons, thalamus, and cerebellum. Connections to the cerebellum are important for coordinated movements. There are
also projections to the temporal cortex, which account for feelings of dizziness; projections to autonomic nervous system
areas in the brainstem, which account for motion sickness; and projections to the primary somatosensory
