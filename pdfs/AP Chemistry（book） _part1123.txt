 composed 
of C, H, N, O, and other nonmetals. For example, the molecular formula for the drug 
Celebrex® is C17H14F3N3O2S.
Most nonmetal oxides are acidic, which means that those that dissolve in water form 
acids:
Nonmetal oxide + water ¡ acid
 
CO21g2 + H2O1l2 ¡ H2CO31aq2 
[7.13]
 
P4O101s2 + 6 H2O1l2 ¡ 4 H3PO41aq2

The reaction of carbon dioxide with water (Figure 7.18) accounts for the acidity of 
carbonated water and, to some extent, rainwater. Because sulfur is present in oil and coal, 
combustion of these common fuels produces sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide. These 
substances dissolve in water to produce acid rain, a major pollutant in many parts of the 
world. Like acids, most nonmetal oxides dissolve in basic solutions to form a salt plus 
water:
 
Nonmetal oxide + base ¡ salt + water 
 
CO21g2 + 2 NaOH1aq2 ¡ Na2CO31aq2 + H2O1l2
