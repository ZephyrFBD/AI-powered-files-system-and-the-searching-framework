s when a species reproduces only once during its lifetime
and then dies. Such species use most of their resource budget during a single reproductive event, sacrificing their health
to the point that they do not survive. Examples of semelparity are bamboo, which flowers once and then dies, and the
Chinook salmon (Figure 36.7a), which uses most of its energy reserves to migrate from the ocean to its freshwater nesting
area, where it reproduces and then dies. Scientists have posited alternate explanations for the evolutionary advantage of
the Chinookâ€™s post-reproduction death: a programmed suicide caused by a massive release of corticosteroid hormones,
presumably so the parents can become food for the offspring, or simple exhaustion caused by the energy demands of
reproduction; these are still being debated.
Iteroparity describes species that reproduce repeatedly during their lives. Some animals are able to mate only once per
year, but survive multiple mating seasons. The pronghorn antelo
