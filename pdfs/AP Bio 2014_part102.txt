O reasons that the number of 
nucleotides in the mature mRNA may differ from the number of base pairs in the gene. 
(c) One genetic change associated with the disorder results in a methionine-to-valine substitution at amino acid 
position 425 of the encoded polypeptide, as shown in Figure 1. Using the codon table in Figure 2, predict  
a DNA point mutation that will result in a methionine-to-valine substitution. 
(d) Propose THREE features of a model to connect the genetic mutation you predicted with the activity of a 
signaling pathway involving the LDS2B gene product.
