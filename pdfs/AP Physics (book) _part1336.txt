. The depth of the sea and the location of reefs, sunken ships, sub-
marines, or schools of fish can be determined in this way. The interior structure of
the Earth is studied in a similar way by detecting reflections of waves traveling
through the Earth whose source was a deliberate explosion (called “soundings”).
An analysis of waves reflected from various structures and boundaries within the
Earth reveals characteristic patterns that are also useful in the exploration for oil
and minerals. (Radar used at airports to track aircraft involves a similar pulse-echo
technique except that it uses electromagnetic (EM) waves, which, like visible light,
travel with a speed of
