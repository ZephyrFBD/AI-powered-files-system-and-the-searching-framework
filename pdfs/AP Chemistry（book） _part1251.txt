elements form must be NF3:
Check The Lewis structure in the center shows that each atom is 
surrounded by an octet of electrons. Once you are accustomed to 
thinking of each line in a Lewis structure as representing two elec-
trons, you can just as easily use the structure on the right to check 
for octets.

Give It Some Thought
The C ¬ O bond length in carbon monoxide, CO, is 1.13 Å, whereas the C ¬ O 
bond length in CO2 is 1.24 Å. Without drawing a Lewis structure, do you think that 
CO contains a single, double, or triple bond?
As a general rule, the length of the bond between two atoms decreases as the number of 
shared electron pairs increases. We will explore this point in greater detail in Section 8.8.
