4. One mole of an ideal gas in a sealed rigid container is ini-
tially at a temperature of 100°C. The temperature is then
increased to 200°C. The pressure in the gas
(a) remains constant.
(b) increases by about 25%.
(c) doubles.
(d) triples.
5. When an ideal gas is warmed from 20°C to 40°C, the gas’s
temperature T that appears in the ideal gas law increases
by a factor
(a) of 2.
(b) of 1.07.
(c) that depends on the temperature scale you use.
