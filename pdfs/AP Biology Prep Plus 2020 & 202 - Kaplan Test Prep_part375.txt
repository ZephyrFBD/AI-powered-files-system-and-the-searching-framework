er the kcat
value, the more quickly the enzyme acts. Thus, to be the more eﬀicient
cofactor, both values should be lower, as is the case for NADP+.
Therefore, (B) is correct. (A) is incorrect because it wrongly states that
the turnover rate is higher for NADP+. (C) and (D) are incorrect because
they wrongly name NAD+ as the more eﬀicient cofactor.

Learning Objective: 9.3
Because the y-intercept represents the maximum velocity and there
are diﬀerent values for each line, the maximum velocity changes
depending on how much of the inhibitor is present. Because
increasing the substrate concentration can restore a competitively
inhibited reaction to its original maximum velocity, this must instead
be a noncompetitive inhibitor. (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect
because the x-intercept represents a substrate concentration, not the
maximum velocity. (C) and (D) are incorrect because they
mischaracterize the graph (the curves have diﬀerent y-intercepts but
the same x-intercept).
