nthesis and begin to produce oxygen
bubbles, the leaf disks will begin to rise in the bicarbonate solution. The
speed at which they rise is a function of the rate of photosynthesis.
Begin collecting data as soon as you shine a light into the beaker. Stop
timing when 50% of the disks have risen. See Figure 19.13.

Figure 19.14 is a sample graph that shows the number of disks floating
versus time.

Figure 19.15 is a graph that shows the rate of photosynthesis compared
to light intensity based on this experiment.

Photosynthesis
Remember that when you conduct an experiment, you must explore one
variable at a time. If you are studying light and its effect on the rate of
photosynthesis, you must be careful that heat from the lamp does not
