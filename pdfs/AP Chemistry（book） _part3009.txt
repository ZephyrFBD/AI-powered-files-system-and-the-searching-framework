process. Thus, the value of qrev is uniquely defined for any two 
states of the system. Because S is a state function, we can use Equation 19.2 to calculate ∆S 
for any isothermal process between states, not just the reversible one.
Give It Some Thought
How can S be a state function when ∆S depends on q, which is not a state function?
∆S for Phase Changes
The melting of a substance at its melting point and the vaporization of a substance 
at its boiling point are isothermal processes. 
 (Section 11.4) Consider the melt-
ing of ice. At 1 atm pressure, ice and liquid water are in equilibrium at 0 °C. Imagine 
melting 1 mol of ice at 0 °C, 1 atm to form 1 mol of liquid water at 0 °C, 1 atm. We can 
achieve this change by adding heat to the system from the surroundings: q = ∆Hfusion, 
 
where ∆Hfusion is the heat of melting. Imagine adding the heat infinitely slowly, rais-
ing the temperature of the surroundings only infinitesimally above 0 °C. When we 
make the change in this fashion, the
