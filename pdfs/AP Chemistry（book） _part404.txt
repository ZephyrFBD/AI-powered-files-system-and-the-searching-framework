 our present 
case, let’s start by increasing the number of O atoms on the right 
side of the equation by placing the coefficient 2 in front of NO2:
O2 + NO ¡  2 NO2 1unbalanced2
 
Now the equation gives two N atoms and four O atoms on the 
right, so we go back to the left side. Placing the coefficient 2 in 
front of NO balances both N and O:
O2 + 2 NO ¡  2 NO2 1balanced2 
(2 N, 4 O)    (2 N, 4 O)
(c) The reactants box contains four O2 and eight NO. Thus, the 
molecular ratio is one O2 for each two NO, as required by the 
balanced equation. The products box contains eight NO2, which 
means the number of NO2 product molecules equals the num-
ber of NO reactant molecules, as the balanced equation requires.
There are eight N atoms in the eight NO molecules in the 
reactants box. There are also 4 * 2 = 8 O atoms in the O2 mol-
ecules and 8 O atoms in the NO molecules, giving a total of 16 O 
atoms. In the products box, we find eight NO2 molecules, which 
contain eight N atoms and 8 * 2 = 1
