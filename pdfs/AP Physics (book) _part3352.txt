umber A) is conserved, as well as electric charge 
When a nucleus emits
an 
particle 
the remaining nucleus will be different from the original: it
has lost two protons and two neutrons. Radium 226 
for example, is an 
emitter. It decays to a nucleus with
and
The nucleus with
is radon (Rn)—see Appendix B or the Periodic Table.
Thus radium decays to radon with the emission of an 
particle. This is written
See Fig. 30–5.
When 
decay occurs, a different element is formed. The daughter nucleus
(
in this case) is different from the parent nucleus (
in this case). This
changing of one element into another is called transmutation of the elements.
Alpha decay can be written in general as
where N is the parent,
the daughter, and Z and A are the atomic number and
atomic mass number, respectively, of the parent.

decays by 
emission to what element? (a) Pb, (b) Gd, (c) Sm,
(d) Er, (e) Yb.
Alpha decay occurs because the strong nuclear force is unable to hold very
large nuclei together. T
