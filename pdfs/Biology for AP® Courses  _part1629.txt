n). Research the total number of chromosomes in the cells of each of these fruits and
think about how this might correspond to the amount of DNA in these fruitsâ€™ cell nuclei. Read about the technique of
DNA isolation to understand how each step in the isolation protocol helps liberate and precipitate DNA.
Hypothesis: Hypothesize whether you would be able to detect a difference in DNA quantity from similarly sized
strawberries and kiwis. Which fruit do you think would yield more DNA?
Test your hypothesis: Isolate the DNA from a strawberry and a kiwi that are similarly sized. Perform the experiment
in at least triplicate for each fruit.
1.
Prepare a bottle of DNA extraction buffer from 900 mL water, 50 mL dish detergent, and two teaspoons of table
salt. Mix by inversion (cap it and turn it upside down a few times).
2.
Grind a strawberry and a kiwifruit by hand in a plastic bag, or using a mortar and pestle, or with a metal bowl and
the end of a blunt instrument. Grind for at least two mi
