such as HF, in which the centers of positive and negative charge do 
not coincide, is a polar molecule. Thus, we describe both bonds and entire molecules 
as being polar and nonpolar.
We can indicate the polarity of the HF molecule in two ways:
H
d+
¬ F
d- or H¬F  
n

CHAPTER 8 Basic Concepts of Chemical Bonding
In the notation on the right, the arrow denotes the shift in electron density toward the flu-
orine atom. The crossed end of the arrow can be thought of as a plus sign designating the 
positive end of the molecule.
Polarity helps determine many properties we observe at the macroscopic level in 
the laboratory and in everyday life. Polar molecules align themselves with respect to 
one another, with the negative end of one molecule and the positive end of another 
attracting each other. Polar molecules are likewise attracted to ions. The negative end 
of a polar molecule is attracted to a positive ion, and the positive end is attracted to 
a negative ion. These interactions
