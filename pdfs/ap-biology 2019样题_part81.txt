Misconception Check 
Students can take agar cubes of different sizes that are soaked in phenolphthalein 
and soak them in vinegar. The students can measure how long it takes for the cubes 
to become clear as the vinegar diffuses into the cubes. Students will find that the 
smaller cubes become clear before the larger cubes and can use their observations to 
determine how cell size affects cell function.

One-Minute Essay  
Before teaching the topic, have students read a case study about osmosis and 
answer questions (either those given with the case study or those you create) about 
the scenario. Ask students to draw what they they think is occurring on the cellular 
level. Then, teach the topic in the way that best fits your classroom. Once students 
have demonstrated an understanding of the topic, have them revisit their answers to 
the questions in the case study as well as their drawings.
