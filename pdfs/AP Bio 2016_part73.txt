Students investigated the effect of light on the carbon cycle in aquatic ecosystems by performing the controlled 
experiment summarized below. The students placed equal amounts of water (pH 7.0) from a large aquarium in glass 
beakers. The students transferred aquatic plants from the aquarium to several of the beakers, and then they placed 
equal numbers of the beakers in the light or the dark (Figure 1: groups I and II). Similarly, the students transferred 
goldfish from the same aquarium to other beakers, and then they placed equal numbers of those beakers in the light 
or dark (Figure 1: groups III and IV). Finally, the students placed an equal number of beakers containing water only 
in the light or dark (Figure 1: groups V and VI). 
After exposing the samples to light or dark for one hour, the students recorded the pH of the water in each beaker. 
Carbon dioxide dissolved in water will lower the pH of an aqueous solutio
