 activity of the operons. As an extension of the activity, use the
model to make predictions about the effects of mutations in any of the regions on gene expression.
Think About It
In E. coli, the trp operon is on by default, while the lac operon is off by default. Why do you think this is the case?

In this section, you will explore the following question:
•
What is the science of epigenetics and how is this process regulated?
Connection for AP® Courses
One reason that eukaryotic gene expression is more complex than prokaryotic gene expression is because the processes of
transcription and translation are physically separated within the eukaryotic cell. Eukaryotic cells also package their genomes
in a more sophisticated way compared with prokaryotic cells. Consequently, eukaryotic cells can regulate gene expression
