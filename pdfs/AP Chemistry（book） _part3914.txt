her each statement is true or false. (a) Pentane 
has a higher molar mass than hexane. (b) The longer the lin-
ear alkyl chain for straight-chain hydrocarbons, the higher 
the boiling point. (c) The local geometry around the alkyne 
group is linear. (d) Propane has two structural isomers.

 24.11  For each of the following hydrocarbons, state how many 
carbon atoms are in each molecule:
(a) methane
(b) decane
(c) 2-methylhexane
(d) neopentane

 24.12  True or false: The weaker a single bond in a molecule, the 
greater the chance it will be the site of a reaction (com-
pared to stronger single bonds in the molecule).
