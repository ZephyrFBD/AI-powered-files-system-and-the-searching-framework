de 1) Based 
on our study of (unit topic), 
list a big idea that you 
understand and word it 
as a summary statement. 
(Side 2) Identify something 
about (unit topic) that you 
do not yet fully understand 
and word it as a statement 
or question.
Functions as a formative 
assessment technique.
At the beginning or end of class, 
show students an image of a 
food chain or food web. On one 
side of an index card, students 
can summarize energy flow 
through ecosystems. On the 
other side of the index card, 
students can write a question 
about this topic. Collect 
the cards and read through 
them, noticing any trends in 
student responses. Address all 
questions that day (if done at the 
beginning of class) or the next 
day (if giving at the end of class).
