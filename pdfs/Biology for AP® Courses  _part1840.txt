The level of transcription of a gene is tested by creating
deletions in the gene as shown in the illustration. These
modified genes are tested for their level of transcription:
(++) normal transcription levels; (+) low transcription
levels; (+++) high transcription levels. Which deletion is
in an enhancer involved in regulating the gene?
a.
deletion 1
b.
deletion 2
c.
deletion 3
d.
deletion 4
