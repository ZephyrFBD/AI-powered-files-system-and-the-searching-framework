Temperature Dependence of Process I

Before we try to construct the rate curve for this graph, we should try to imagine how 
this experiment was carried out. It seems clear that the experiment must have started 
with several different batches of A and that each reaction mixture was kept at a different 
temperature. Then, every half-hour, the amount of A remaining was measured and the 
amount consumed was calculated. The results might have been plotted in five separate 
progress curves, as shown in Figure A.19.
