d both groups of fish after
placing a larger fish known to be a predator of minnows
into one of the tanks. Fish in both tanks demonstrated
alarm behavior. How can you explain these observations?
a.
Fish in the tank that received the predator
released alarm signals in chemical form. These
compounds circulated and reached the other
tank, eliciting an alarm response from the fish
there nonetheless.
b.
Fish in the tank that received the predator
released alarm signals in the form of electrical
signals. These compounds circulated and
reached the other tank, eliciting an alarm
response from the fish there nonetheless.
c.
The predator introduced in one tank of fish
released alarm signals in chemical form. These
compounds circulated and reached the other
tank, eliciting an alarm response from the fish
there nonetheless.
d.
Fish in the tank that did not receive the predator
released alarm signals in the chemical form.
These compounds circulated and reached the
other tank and elicited an alarm r
