nonpolar amino acids lie in the interior of the protein, whereas
the hydrophilic R groups lie on the outside. The former types of interactions are also known as hydrophobic interactions.
Interaction between cysteine side chains forms disulfide linkages in the presence of oxygen, the only covalent bond forming
during protein folding.
Figure 3.31 The tertiary structure of proteins is determined by a variety of chemical interactions. These include
hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding and disulfide linkages.
All of these interactions, weak and strong, determine the final three-dimensional shape of the protein. When a protein loses
its three-dimensional shape, it may no longer be functional.
Quaternary Structure
In nature, some proteins are formed from several polypeptides, also known as subunits, and the interaction of these
subunits forms the quaternary structure. Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure. For
example, insulin (a g
