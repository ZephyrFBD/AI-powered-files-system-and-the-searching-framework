er of experiments that were
crucial for establishing our present-day view that heat, like work, represents a
transfer of energy. One of Joule’s experiments is shown (simplified) in Fig. 14–1.
The falling weight causes the paddle wheel to turn. The friction between the
water and the paddle wheel causes the temperature of the water to rise slightly
(barely measurable, in fact, by Joule). The same temperature rise could also be
obtained by heating the water on a hot stove. In this and many other experiments
(some involving electrical energy), Joule determined that a given amount of
work done was always equivalent to a particular amount of heat input. Quantita-
tively, 4.186 joules (J) of work was found to be equivalent to 1 calorie (cal) of heat.
This is known as the mechanical equivalent of heat:
As a result of these and other experiments, scientists came to interpret heat
not as a substance, and not exactly as a form of energy. Rather, heat refers to a
transfer of energy: when heat flow
