KEY TERMS
gene variations that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes
any of the non-sex chromosomes
hypothetical inheritance pattern in which parental traits are blended together in the
offspring to produce an intermediate physical appearance
in a heterozygote, complete and simultaneous expression of both alleles for the same characteristic
inheritance pattern in which a character shows a range of trait values with small gradations rather
than large gaps between them
