Problem 45.
44. (II) A centrifuge rotor rotating at 9200 rpm is shut off and
is eventually brought uniformly to rest by a frictional
torque of 
If the mass of the rotor is 3.10 kg and
it can be approximated as a solid cylinder of radius
0.0710 m, through how many revolutions will the rotor
turn before coming to rest, and how long will it take?
45. (II) To get a flat, uniform cylindrical satellite spinning at
the correct rate, engineers fire four tangential rockets as
shown in Fig. 8â€“50. Suppose that the satellite has a mass of
3600 kg and a radius of 4.0 m, and that the rockets each
add a mass of 250 kg. What is the steady force required of
each rocket if the satellite is to reach 32 rpm in 5.0 min,
starting from rest?
