 Mam wipes her face on the back of her sleeve and takes the docket. 
 
 She tells the men, God bless you for your kindness.They nod and look 
 
 at the table, the ceiling, the walls and tell her send in the next woman. 
 
 The women outside tell Mam,When you go to McGrath’s, keep an 
 
 eye on the oul’ bitch for she’ll cheat you on the weight. She’ll put stuff 
 
 on a paper on the scale with the paper hanging down on her side 
 
 behind the counter where she thinks you can’t see it. She’ll pull on that 
 
 paper so that you’re lucky if you get half of what you’re supposed to get. 
 
 And she has pictures of the Virgin Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus 
 
 all over the shop, and she’s forever on her knees abroad in St. Joseph’s 
 
 chapel clackin’ her rosary beads an’ breathing like a virgin martyr, the 
 
 oul’ bitch. 
 
 Nora says, I’ll go with you, missus. I’m on to the same Mrs. 
 
 McGrath and I’ll know if she’s cheating you. 
 
 She leads the way to the shop in Parnel
