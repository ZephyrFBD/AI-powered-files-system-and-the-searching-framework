mid would become inverted due to the rapid
movement of energy and materials from one level to another.
(A)
The level representing the primary producers would increase,
but the upper levels would stay the same size as before
because of the limits on energy transfer.
(B)
The pyramid would stay the same because the amount of
energy that could be transferred from one level to another
would be unchanged.
(C)
There would be an increase in the size of each piece of the
pyramid due to gradually increasing biomass at each level.
(D)
4. The figure below shows a model generated from a study of
interactions in a Serengeti ecosystem. This figure describes
hypothesized relationships between a parasite that causes
disease in wildebeest, rinderpest, and other important
components of the ecosystem. Thick arrows represent dominant
eﬀects, and “grass” is in a dotted circle because that variable was
not directly measured in the study.
