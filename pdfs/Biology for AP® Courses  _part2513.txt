 nitrogen to ammonia, which is easily usable by plants. The use of legumes is an
excellent alternative to chemical fertilization and is of special interest to sustainable agriculture, which seeks to minimize
the use of chemicals and conserve natural resources. Through symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the plant benefits from using
an endless source of nitrogen: the atmosphere. Bacteria benefit from using photosynthates (carbohydrates produced during
photosynthesis) from the plant and having a protected niche. Additionally, the soil benefits from being naturally fertilized.
Therefore, the use of rhizobia as biofertilizers is a sustainable practice.
Why are legumes so important? Some, like soybeans, are key sources of agricultural protein. Some of the most important
grain legumes are soybean, peanuts, peas, chickpeas, and beans. Other legumes, such as alfalfa, are used to feed cattle.
