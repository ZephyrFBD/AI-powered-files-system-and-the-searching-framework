The ability to describe biological 
processes, principles, and concepts is 
central to the study of biology. Visual 
representations and models are important 
tools to help students understand 
relationships within biological systems. 
In this unit the successful student should 
use visual representations to demonstrate 
understanding of how the properties of 
water allow it to play a major role in biological 
systems and to show the properties and 
structure of biological macromolecules.
In biology, an argument involves making
