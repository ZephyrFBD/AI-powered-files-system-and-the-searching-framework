 relationships with each other and with the
environmentâ€”is a more accurate and descriptive model for ecosystems. A food web is a graphic representation of a holistic,
non-linear web of primary producers, primary consumers, and higher-level consumers used to describe ecosystem structure
and dynamics (Figure 37.6).
Figure 37.6 This food web shows the interactions between organisms across trophic levels in the Lake Ontario
ecosystem. Primary producers are outlined in green, primary consumers in orange, secondary consumers in blue, and
tertiary (apex) consumers in purple. Arrows point from an organism that is consumed to the organism that consumes
it. Notice how some lines point to more than one trophic level. For example, the opossum shrimp eats both primary
producers and primary consumers. (credit: NOAA, GLERL)
A comparison of the two types of structural ecosystem models shows strength in both. Food chains are more flexible for
analytical modeling, are easier to follow, and are easier to
