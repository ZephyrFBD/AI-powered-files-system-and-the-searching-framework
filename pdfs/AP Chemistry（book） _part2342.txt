[14.101] The rate of a ﬁrst-order reaction is followed by spectroscopy, 
monitoring the absorbance of a colored reactant at 520 nm. 
The reaction occurs in a 1.00-cm sample cell, and the only 
colored species in the reaction has an extinction coefficient 
of 5.60 * 103 M -1 cm-1 at 520 nm. (a) Calculate the initial 
concentration of the colored reactant if the absorbance is 
0.605 at the beginning of the reaction. (b) The absorbance 
falls to 0.250 at 30.0 min. Calculate the rate constant in 
units of s - 1. (c) Calculate the half-life of the reaction. 
 
(d) How long does it take for the absorbance to fall to 0.100?
 
[14.102] A colored dye compound decomposes to give a colorless 
product. The original dye absorbs at 608 nm and has an 
extinction coefficient of 4.7 * 104 M
