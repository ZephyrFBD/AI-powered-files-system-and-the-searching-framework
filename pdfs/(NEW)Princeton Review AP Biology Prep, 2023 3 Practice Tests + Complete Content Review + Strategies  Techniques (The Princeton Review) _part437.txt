tance, you, your dog, and the fleas on your dog are all members of the same
community.
Each organism has its own niche—its position or function in a community. When two organisms occupy the same
niche, they will compete for the resources within that niche. If a species can occupy an unoccupied niche, it will
usually thrive without competition. These connections are shown in the food chain. A food chain describes the way
different organisms depend on one another for food. There are basically four levels to the food chain: producers,
primary consumers, secondary consumers, and tertiary consumers.
Producers (autotrophs)
Producers, or autotrophs, have all of the raw building blocks to make their own food. From water and the gases
that abound in the atmosphere and with the aid of the Sun’s energy, photosynthetic autotrophs convert light energy
to chemical energy. They accomplish this through photosynthesis.
Primary productivity is the rate at which autotrophs convert light energy into chemi
