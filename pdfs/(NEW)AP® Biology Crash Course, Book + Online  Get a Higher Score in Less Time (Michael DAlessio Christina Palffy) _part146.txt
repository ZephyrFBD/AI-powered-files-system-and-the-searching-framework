e, in an organism’s environment, the organism
may respond in a variety of ways.
1. A tolerance curve describes how able or active an organism is over the range of change it may
experience for a particular factor in its environment; at the extreme limits of its range, an organism
may not survive.

2. An organism may acclimate (adjust its tolerance) to an environmental factor, such as when humans
produce more red blood cells as their bodies adjust to higher elevation.
3. Regulators are organisms that spend metabolic energy to internally regulate a physical factor, such as
temperature or salinity, to keep it within a limited range even though their environment may exhibit a
wider range for that factor.
4. In conformers, the factor is not internally regulated; instead, the conformer’s internal factor changes to
match the environmental factor as it increases or decreases.
Regulators and Conformers Respond Differently to Environmental Change
5. Individuals may resp
