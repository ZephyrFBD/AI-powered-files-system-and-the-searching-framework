Glycogen is a starch-like substance synthesized in the animal body. Glycogen mol-
ecules vary in molecular weight from about 5000 to more than 5 million amu. Glycogen 
acts as a kind of energy bank in the body. It is concentrated in the muscles and liver. In 
muscles, it serves as an immediate source of energy; in the liver, it s
