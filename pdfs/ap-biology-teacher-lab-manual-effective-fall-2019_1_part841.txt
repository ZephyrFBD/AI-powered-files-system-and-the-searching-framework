at is turning down means that the process is slowing 
down. When the rate curve hits the x-axis, it means that the reaction has stopped. 
Probably 80 percent of the graphs you will encounter in biology are either rate curves 
or progress curves. You will have noticed from the preceding discussion that biologists 
tend to use the words “graph” and “curve” interchangeably. Technically, of course, the 
entire picture, including the abscissa, ordinate, labels, numbers, units, index marks, and 
title, together with the line graph portrayed, is the “graph,” while the line graph itself is 
called the “curve.” You will notice, too, that biologists call a line graph a “curve,” even 
though the line itself may be perfectly straight. 
 
  
APPENDIX B
 
To summarize, remember that a progress curve is made from measurements at 
different times during the progress of a reaction that is continuous with time. A graph 
that shows how much or to what extent a reaction has occurred at different times is
