 compound, which Appendix D gives as 
3.9 * 10-11. The value of Ksp is unchanged by the presence of 
additional solutes. Because of the common-ion effect, however, 
the solubility of the salt decreases in the presence of common 
ions. We use our standard equilibrium techniques of starting 
with the equation for CaF2 dissolution, setting up a table of 
initial and equilibrium concentrations, and using the Ksp expres-
sion to determine the concentration of the ion that comes only 
from CaF2.

Solubility and pH
The solubility of almost any ionic compound is affected if the solution is made suffi-
ciently acidic or basic. The effects are noticeable, however, only when one (or both) 
ions in the compound is at least moderately acidic or basic. The metal hydroxides, such 
as Mg1OH22, are examples of compounds containing a strongly basic ion, t
