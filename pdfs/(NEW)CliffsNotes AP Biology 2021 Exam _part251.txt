Genetics problems require the application of probability rules. If a coin is tossed, there is a ½ (50%) chance, or
probability, that it will be heads. If a coin is tossed again, there is, again, a ½ chance that it will be heads. The first
toss does not affect the second toss; that is, the two tosses are independent. To determine the probability of two or
more independent events occurring together, you merely multiply the probabilities of each event happening
separately. This is the multiplication rule of probability. For two consecutive tosses of a coin, the probability of
getting two heads is ½ × ½ = ¼. For three tosses, the probability of three heads would be ½ × ½ × ½ = ⅛.

1. A gene represents the genetic material on a chromosome that contains the instructions for creating a particular
trait. Since the formula for carrying out these instructions is described by a genetic code, a gene is often said to code
