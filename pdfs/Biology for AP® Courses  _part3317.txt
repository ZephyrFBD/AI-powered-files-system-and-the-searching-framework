envelope, then bind to receptors in the
nucleus. The hormone-receptor complex stimulates transcription of specific genes.
Plasma Membrane Hormone Receptors
Amino acid derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not lipid-derived (lipid-soluble) and therefore cannot diffuse
through the plasma membrane of cells. Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer surface of the plasma
membrane, via plasma membrane hormone receptors. Unlike steroid hormones, lipid insoluble hormones do not directly
affect the target cell because they cannot enter the cell and act directly on DNA. Binding of these hormones to a cell surface
receptor results in activation of a signaling pathway; this triggers intracellular activity and carries out the specific effects

associated with the hormone. In this way, nothing passes through the cell membrane; the hormone that binds at the surface
remains at the surface of the cell while the intracellular product remains i
