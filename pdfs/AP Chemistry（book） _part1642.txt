 contain equal 
numbers of molecules (Avogadro’s hypothesis). For a gas at constant 
temperature and pressure, the volume of the gas is directly propor-
tional to the number of moles of gas (Avogadro’s law). Each of these 
gas laws is a special case of the ideal-gas equation.
THE IDEAL-GAS EQUATION (SECTIONS 10.4 AND 10.5) The 
ideal-gas equation, PV = nRT, is the equation of state for an ideal gas. 
The term R in this equation is the gas constant. We can use the ideal- 
gas equation to calculate variations in one variable when one or more 
of the others are changed. Most gases at pressures less than 10 atm 
and temperatures near 273 K and above obey the ideal-gas equation 
reasonably well. The conditions of 273 K 10 °C2 and 1 atm are known 
as the standard temperature and pressure (STP). In all applications of 
the ideal-gas equation, we must remember to convert temperatures 
to the absolute-temperature scale (the kelvin scale).
Using the ideal-gas equation, we can relate the density
