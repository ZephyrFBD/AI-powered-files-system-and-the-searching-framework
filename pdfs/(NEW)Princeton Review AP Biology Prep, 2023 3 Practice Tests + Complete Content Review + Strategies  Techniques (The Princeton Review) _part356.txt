s
of the developing embryo are used as a scaffold for development (like the cells that used to exist in the spaces
between your fingers and toes), and when they are no longer necessary, those cells undergo apoptosis. Think of it
like an eraser coming along and erasing the webbing tissue between fingers and toes.
MUTATIONS
A mutation is an error in the genetic code. Mutations can occur because DNA is damaged and cannot be repaired or
because DNA damage is repaired incorrectly. Damage can be caused by chemicals or radiation. For example,
radiation can cause breaks in the DNA strand. External chemicals can cause inappropriate chemical bonds to form
between different parts of DNA, known as cross-linking. A mutation can also occur when a DNA polymerase or an
RNA polymerase makes a mistake. DNA polymerases have proofreading abilities, but RNA polymerases do not.
This is because RNA is only a temporary molecule and if a mistake is made, it is not usually as problematic. DNA is
important now a
