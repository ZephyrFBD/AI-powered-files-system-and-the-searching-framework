What is the pH of this solution?
 18.90  The precipitation of Al1OH23 1Ksp = 1.3 * 10-332 is some-
times used to purify water. (a) Estimate the pH at which 
precipitation of Al1OH23 will begin if 5.0 lb of Al21SO423 
is added to 2000 gal of water. (b) Approximately how 
many pounds of CaO must be added to the water to 
achieve this pH?
 [18.91]  The valuable polymer polyurethane is made by a condensa-
tion reaction of alcohols (ROH) with compounds that con-
tain an isocyanate group (RNCO). Two reactions that can
