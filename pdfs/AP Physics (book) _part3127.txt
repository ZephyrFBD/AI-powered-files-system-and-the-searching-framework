imilar if we were
using, instead, an electron microscope.) As we saw in Chapter 25, objects can be
seen to a precision at best of about the wavelength of the radiation used due to
diffraction. If we want a precise position measurement, we must use a short
wavelength. But a short wavelength corresponds to high frequency and large
momentum
and the more momentum the photons have, the more
momentum they can give the object when they strike it. If we use photons of
longer wavelength, and correspondingly smaller momentum, the object’s motion
when struck by the photons will not be affected as much. But the longer wave-
length means lower resolution, so the object’s position will be less accurately
known. Thus the act of observing produces an uncertainty in both the position
and the momentum of the electron. This is the essence of the uncertainty principle
first enunciated by Heisenberg in 1927.
Quantitatively, we can make an approximate calculation of the magnitude of
the uncertainties. If we
