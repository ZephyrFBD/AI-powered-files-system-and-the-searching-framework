Water has many unique properties that favor life, including (A), a high specific heat, (B), high surface tension
and cohesive properties, and (D), high intermolecular forces due to hydrogen bonding. However, water is a
very polar molecule and is an excellent solvent, making (C) inaccurate and the correct answer.

B
The pH scale is logarithmically based, meaning that each difference of 1 on the log scale is indicative of a
tenfold difference in the hydrogen (H+) ion concentration. According to the question, the pH values of the
cytoplasm of cells and gastric juices are approximately 7.4 and 1.5, respectively. Therefore, the pH values vary
by 6, and the hydrogen (H+) ion concentrations must vary by six orders of ten (106), or 1,000,000-fold. Since
lower pH values have more hydrogen ions, they are also more acidic.

Hydrolysis adds water to a polymer to break the linkages between monomers. Therefore, (A), free water, will
not result because water is being broken down in the reac
