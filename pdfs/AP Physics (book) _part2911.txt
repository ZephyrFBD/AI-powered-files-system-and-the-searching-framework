But what does observer 
observe and measure? From our 
reference
frame, we can predict what 
will observe. We see that 
moves to the right
during the time the light is traveling to 
from 
and 
As shown in Fig. 26–5b,
we can see from our 
reference frame that the light from 
has already 
passed 
whereas the light from 
has not yet reached 
That is,
observes
the light coming from 
before observing the light coming from 
Given 
(i) that light travels at the same speed c in any direction and in any reference
frame, and (ii) that the distance 
equals 
then observer 
can only
conclude that the event at 
occurred before the event at 
The two events are
not simultaneous for 
even though they are for 
We thus find that two events which take place at different locations and are
simultaneous to one observer, are actually not simultaneous
