nder effect are examples of genetic drift. However, the bottleneck effect is a
process in which a large portion of a genome is wiped out, whereas the founder effect occurs when members
of a larger population migrate to establish their own population.
c.
Both the bottleneck and founder effect change the genetic structure of a population. However, the bottleneck
effect reduces or eliminates alleles within a population, whereas the founder effect introduces or increases
alleles.
d.
Both the bottleneck and founder effect change the genetic structure of a population. However, the bottleneck
effect occurs when inbreeding depression kills off part of a population, whereas the founder effect relies on
nonrandom mating.

Testing the Bottleneck Effect
Question: How do natural disasters affect the genetic structure of a population?
Background: When much of a population is s
