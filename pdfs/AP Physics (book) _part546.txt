the curve? [Hint: Consider the direction of the friction
force when the car goes too slow or too fast.]
*5;4 Nonuniform Circular Motion
*24. (I) Determine the tangential and centripetal components 
of the net force exerted on the car (by the ground) in 
Example 5–8 when its speed is 
The car’s mass is 950 kg.
*25. (II) A car at the Indianapolis 500 accelerates uniformly from
the pit area, going from rest to 
in a semicircular
arc with a radius of 220 m. Determine the tangential and
radial acceleration of the car when it is halfway through 
the arc, assuming constant tangential acceleration. If the
curve were flat, what coefficient of static friction would be
necessary between the tires and the road to provide this
acceleration with no slipping or skidding?
*26. (II) For each of the cases described below, sketch and label
the total acceleration vector, the radial acceleration vector,
and the tangential acceleration vector. (a) A car is 
accelerating from 
to 
as it rounds a curve
