 new individuals to migrate into it.
b.
The more individuals in a population, the more alleles are present in its gene pool.
c.
The fewer individuals in a population, the more likely it is to go extinct.
d.
The more individuals in a population, the larger and more stable is its gene pool.
Small populations are more susceptible to the forces of genetic drift. Large populations, on the other hand, are buffered
against the effects of chance. If one individual of a population of 10 individuals happens to die at a young age before it
leaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes—1/10 of the population’s gene pool—will be suddenly lost. In
a population of 100, that’s only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it is much less impactful on the population’s
genetic structure.
