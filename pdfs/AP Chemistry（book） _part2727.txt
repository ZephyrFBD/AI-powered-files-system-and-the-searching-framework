CH3COOH
CH3COO−
OH−
Added OH− converts
CH3COOH(aq) into
CH3COO−(aq),
forming buffer solution.

pH change near the 
equivalence point is 
smaller than in strong 
acid–strong base titration.
pH > 7.0 at equivalence 
point because CH3COO− 
is a weak base that reacts 
with water to make OH−.
Equivalence point 
occurs when moles 
base = moles acid.
