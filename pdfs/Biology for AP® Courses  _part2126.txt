spring of their own that also carry the allele, thus, perpetuating the cycle. Over time, the allele will
spread throughout the population. Some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way, meaning that every individual of the
population will carry the allele, while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele
from the gene pool. The gene pool is the sum of all the alleles in a population.

Sometimes, allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no advantage to the population over existing allele
frequencies. This phenomenon is called genetic drift. Natural selection and genetic drift u
