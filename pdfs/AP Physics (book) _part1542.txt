†Equation 14–5 is quite similar to the relations describing diffusion (Section 13–13) and the flow of
fluids through a pipe (Section 10–12). In those cases, the flow of matter was found to be proportional
to the concentration gradient 
or to the pressure gradient 
This close simi-
larity is one reason we speak of the “flow” of heat. Yet we must keep in mind that no substance is
flowing in the case of heat—it is energy that is being transferred.

Heat loss through windows. A major source of heat loss
from a house in cold weather is through the windows. Calculate the rate of heat flow
through a glass window 
in area and 3.2 mm thick, if the temperatures
at the inner and outer surfaces are 15.0°C and 14.0°C, respectively (Fig. 14–7).
