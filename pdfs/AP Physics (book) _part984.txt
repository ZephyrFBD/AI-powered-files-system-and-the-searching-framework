4. A heavy ball suspended by a cable is pulled to the side by a
horizontal force 
as shown in Fig. 9–43. If angle is small,
the magnitude of the force F can be less than the weight of
the ball because:
(a) the force holds up only part of the ball’s weight.
(b) even though the ball is stationary, it is not really in
equilibrium.
(c)
is equal to only the
