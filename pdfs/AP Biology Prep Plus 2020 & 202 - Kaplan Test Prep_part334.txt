ncorrect
because transmembrane domains could be similar across a wide range
of proteins, since spanning the membrane always requires
hydrophobic residues. (D) is incorrect because only the tyrosine kinase
domain is essential for determining the evolutionary relationship.

A patient with type II diabetes is resistant to insulin, but the β cells of
the pancreas still appropriately respond to high glucose levels. This
suggests that both glucose and insulin levels would remain high in
such a patient aȇer eating. Only Patient A presents such a response, so
he is the most likely to suﬀer from type II diabetes, making (A) correct.
(B) is incorrect because Patient B shows a normal response, in which
glucose and insulin levels spike aȇer eating but then decline with time.
(C) is incorrect because Patient C seems to have type I diabetes, since
the consumption of glucose does not trigger an increase in his insulin
levels. (D) is incorrect because only Patient A shows a
