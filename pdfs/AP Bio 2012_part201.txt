pq represents the 
frequency (proportion, percent) of the heterozygous 
straight-wing flies and that each has one copy of the 
dominant allele and one copy of the recessive allele. 
(Part b) The student is able write a coherent paragraph with 
appropriate terminology to correctly describe one of the 
following conditions: large population size, no selection, no 
mutation, no migration, random mating. Descriptions show 
an understanding that:
• 
Large populations decrease the role of chance 
fluctuations in allele frequencies that occur more 
often in smaller populations. This is referred to as 
genetic drift.
• 
No natural selection ensures no differential 
survival or reproductive success of individuals 
carrying different genotypes that would alter 
allele frequencies.
• 
No mutations ensures no introduction or removal 
of genes from chromosomes or changes to the 
genes and thus the gene pool.
• 
No migration or gene flow ensures no transfers of 
alleles between populations that woul
