 low-plated phenotype 
to having more individuals of the completely-plated phenotype than of the low-plated phenotype. Figure 1 shows the 
distribution of plated phenotypes in Lake Washington sticklebacks at four time points between 1957 and 2005. 
 
 
A single gene, ectodysplasin (EDA), is thought to be responsible for the variation in the number of armor plates in 
sticklebacks. Figure 2 shows a phylogenetic tree constructed by comparing DNA sequences of the EDA gene from a 
number of stickleback populations with low-plated or completely plated phenotypes. Figure 3 shows a phylogenetic 
tree constructed by comparing the sequences of 25 genes that were randomly selected from the same populations as 
shown in Figure 2. In both figures, shaded populations display the completely plated phenotype.
