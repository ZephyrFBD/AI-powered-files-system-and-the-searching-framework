 lines in the emis-
sion spectrum shown in Figure 6.11.
 6.42  The Lyman series of emission lines of the hydrogen atom are 
those for which nf = 1. (a) Determine the region of the elec-
tromagnetic spectrum in which the lines of the Lyman series 
are observed. (b) Calculate the wavelengths of the ﬁrst three 
lines in the Lyman series—those for which ni = 2, 3, and 4.
 6.43  One of the emission lines of the hydrogen atom has a 
wavelength of 93.07 nm. (a) In what region of the electro-
magnetic spectrum is this emission found? (b) Determine 
the initial and final values of n associated with this emission.
 6.44  The hydrogen atom can absorb light of wavelength 1094 nm. 
(a) In what region of the electromagnetic spectrum is this 
absorption found? (b) Determine the initial and ﬁnal values 
of n associated with this absorption.
 6.45  Order the following transitions in the hydrogen atom from 
smallest to largest frequency of light absorbed: n = 3 to 
n = 6, n = 4 to n = 9, n = 2 to n = 3,
