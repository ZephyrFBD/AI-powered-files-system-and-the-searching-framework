e, find the probability of the outcomes for each trait, and
then multiply the probabilities together. Aa × Aa would produce 
 of the time. Similarly, Bb × Bb would
produce 
 of the time. Cc × Cc would produce 
 of the time. Multiply all three probabilities together: 
.
9. (C) Since the mother is Rh positive, she must have at least one dominant R allele. Since she has a child who is
Rh negative, she must have an r allele. Therefore, the mother must be heterozygous Rr. Choice (A) is incorrect
because if the mother was rr, she would not be Rh positive. Choice (B) is incorrect because an RR mother could
not produce an Rh negative child. Choice (D) is incorrect because since the mother is Rh positive and her son is
Rh negative, they cannot have the same genotype.
10. (D) Since the son is Rh negative, his genotype must be rr. He must have inherited one r allele from each parent.
So the father (whose Rh phenotype is unknown) could be either Rr or rr. Choice (A) is incorrect because an RR
