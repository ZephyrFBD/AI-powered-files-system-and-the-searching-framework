th structures are held together by hydrogen bonds. In the
α-helix structure, the hydrogen bonds form between the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group in one amino acid and another
amino acid that is four amino acids farther along the chain.
Figure 3.30 The α-helix and β-pleated sheet are secondary structures of proteins that form because of hydrogen
bonding between carbonyl and amino groups in the peptide backbone. Certain amino acids have a propensity to form
an α-helix, while others have a propensity to form a β-pleated sheet.
Every helical turn in an alpha helix has 3.6 amino acid residues. The R groups (the variant groups) of the polypeptide
protrude out from the α-helix chain. In the β-pleated sheet, the “pleats” are formed by hydrogen bonding between atoms on
the backbone of the polypeptide chain. The R groups are attached to the carbons and extend above and below the folds of
the pleat. The pleated segments align parallel or antiparallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds form betwe
