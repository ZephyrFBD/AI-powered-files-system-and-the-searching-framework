and do not occur in nature. They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can
be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis. Proteins that are expressed from
recombinant DNA molecules are called recombinant proteins. Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing
genes. The recombinant DNA may need to be moved into a different vector (or host) that is better designed for gene
expression. Plasmids may also be engineered to express proteins only when stimulated by certain environmental factors, so
that scientists can control the expression of the recombinant proteins.
