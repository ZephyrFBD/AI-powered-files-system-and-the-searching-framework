ation.
(C) The importance of internal organelles is that they
compartmentalize the cell so that widely different reactions can all
occur at the same time, each in their own space.
(B) Glycolysis reoxidizes NADH to NAD+ so that glycolysis can
continue. Glycolysis would cease if there were not a constant supply
of NAD+ to bind to hydrogen. Choice A is incorrect because
glycolysis produces a small amount of ATP by substrate-level
phosphorylation. Choice C is incorrect because glycolysis produces
pyruvate for the citric acid cycle. Choice D is incorrect because,
although it is correct that glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm,
where glycolysis takes place is inconsequential in the broader
scheme of energy production compared to the important role
described in choice B.
(B) Earth is about 4.5 billion years old. The planet took about 1
billion years to cool down and be stable enough for life to evolve,
and for the first cell—a prokaryotic cell—to develop. About 1.5
billion years ago, the
