CHAPTER 19 Chemical Thermodynamics
 19.46  Cyclopropane and propylene are isomers that both have 
the formula C3H6. Based on the molecular structures 
shown, which of these isomers would you expect to have 
the higher standard molar entropy at 25 °C?
 19.54  (a) Is the standard free-energy change, ∆G°, always larger 
than ∆G? (b) For any process that occurs at constant tem-
perature and pressure, what is the significance of ∆G = 0? 
(c) For a certain process, ∆G is large and negative. Does 
this mean that the process necessarily has a low activation 
barrier?
 19.55  For a certain chemical reaction, ∆H° = -35.4 kJ and 
∆S° = -85.5 J>K. (a) Is the reaction exothermic or endo-
thermic? (b) Does the reaction lead to an increase or 
decrease in the randomness or disorder o
