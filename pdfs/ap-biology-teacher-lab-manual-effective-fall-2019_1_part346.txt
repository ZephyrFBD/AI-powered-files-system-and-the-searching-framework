derstanding 
•  ENE-1: The highly complex organization of living systems requires constant input of 
energy and the exchange of macromolecules. 
■ Learning Objectives 
•  ENE-1.I: Describe the photosynthetic processes that allow organisms to capture and 
store energy. 
•  ENE-1.J: Explain how cells capture energy from light and transfer it to biological 
molecules for storage and use. 
■ Science Skill 
•  6.B: Support a claim with evidence from biological principles, concepts, processes, 
and/or data. 
■ ARE STUDENTS READY TO COMPLETE A SUCCESSFUL INQUIRY­
BASED, STUDENT-DIRECTED INVESTIGATION? 
Before students investigate photosynthesis, they should demonstrate an understanding 
of the following concepts related to the physical properties of light. The concepts may be 
scaffolded according to level of skills and conceptual understanding. 
•  Measuring light intensity 
•  The inverse square law 
•  The wave nature of light (visible light spectrum, i.e., colors) 
•  Light as energy
