In fruit flies, the gene for curved wings ( c) and the gene for spineless bristles (s) are on different chromosomes. The
respective wild-type alleles for each of these genes produce normal wings and normal bristles.
7. From the cross CCSS × ccss, what is the probability of having an offspring that is CcSs?
 
8. From the cross CcSs × CcSs, what is the probability of having an offspring that is ccss?
 
9. From the cross CcSs × CcSs, what is the probability of having an offspring that is normal for both traits?
 
Questions 10-11 refer to the following.
In snapdragons, the allele for tall plants ( T) is dominant to the allele for dwarf plants (t), and the allele for red
flowers (R) is codominant with the allele for white flowers (R′). The heterozygous condition for flower color is pink
(RR′).
10. If a dwarf red snapdragon is crossed with a white snapdragon
homozygous for tall, what are the probable genotypes and phenoty
