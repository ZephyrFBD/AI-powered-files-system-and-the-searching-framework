.4 | Transport of Gases in Human Bodily Fluids
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
How is oxygen bound to hemoglobin and transported to body tissues?
•
How is carbon dioxide transported from body tissues to the lungs?
Connection for AP® Courses
Gas exchange at the tissue level also occurs by diffusion. The majority of oxygen transported from the lungs to body tissue
is bound to a protein called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a quaternary protein comprise of four iron-containing heme groups;
iron has a great affinity for oxygen. (We know this because iron rusts when exposed to air.)
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A learning objective merges re
