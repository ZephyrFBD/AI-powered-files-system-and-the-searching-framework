use the value of R at all. For example,
many problems involve a change in the pressure, temperature, and volume of a
fixed amount of gas. In this case,
since n and R remain
constant. If we now let 
and 
represent the appropriate variables initially,
and 
represent the variables after the change is made, then we can write 
[fixed n]
If we know any five of the quantities in this equation, we can solve for the sixth.
Or, if one of the three variables is constant (
or
or
)
then we can use this equation to solve for one unknown when given the other
three quantities.

Check tires cold. An automobile tire is filled (Fig. 13–17)
to a gauge pressure of 
at 10°C. After a drive of 100 km, the
temperature within the tire rises to 40°C. What is the pressure within the tire now?
APPROACH We do not know the number of moles of gas, or the volume of the
tire, but we ass
