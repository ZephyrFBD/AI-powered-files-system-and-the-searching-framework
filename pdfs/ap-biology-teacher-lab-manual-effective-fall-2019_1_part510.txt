rigerate before use. This will slow bacterial growth. 
f.  E. coli forms off-white colonies that are uniformly circular with smooth edges. 
Avoid using plates with contaminant colonies such as mold. 
3. Prepare plasmid. 
The quantity of DNA is so small that the vial may appear empty. Tap the vial or 
spin it in a microcentrifuge to ensure that the DNA is not sticking to the cap. If the 
plasmid is not hydrated, refer to instructions that come with the sample. Store the 
vial of hydrated DNA in a refrigerator. Rehydrated plasmid should be used within 24 
hours. 
 
â–  Advance Preparation for Step 3: 
Immediately Before Transformation Investigation 
1. Aliquot solutions. 
Each student workstation will need 1 mL of transformation solution and 1 mL of LB 
nutrient broth. You might have to aliquot these solutions into separate color-coded 
2 mL microtubes. If the LB nutrient broth is aliquoted one day prior to the lab, it 
should be refrigerated. Make sure to label the tubes with permanent ma
