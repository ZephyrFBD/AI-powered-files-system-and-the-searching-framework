s tend to produce more oﬀspring that survive. For
example, if a bird with a long beak can get more food from holes in
4.
The selection for more “adaptive” traits tends to narrow a population of
individuals down to those who are best suited for a particular
environment. If changes occur in the environment, selection favors
individuals best suited to the new environment. The theory of natural
selection could explain the diﬀerences Darwin observed in species he
studied and helps to explain biodiversity in organisms today.
NATURAL SELECTION AND VARIATION
Natural selection is the diﬀerential survival and reproduction of
individuals based on variation in genetically controlled traits. These
diﬀering rates of survival and reproduction are due to forces in the
environment and/or to forces exhibited by other species. Evolutionary
fitness is measured by the reproductive success of a species. To
understand natural selection, it is necessary to understand variation.
Ultimately, all variation origi
