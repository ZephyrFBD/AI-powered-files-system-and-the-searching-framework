Kinematics deals with the description of how objects
move. The description of the motion of any object must
always be given relative to some particular reference frame.
The displacement of an object is the change in position of
the object.
Summary
Average speed is the distance traveled divided by the elapsed
time or time interval,
(the time period over which we choose
to make our observations). An object’s average velocity over
a particular time interval is
(2;2)
where 
is the displacement during the time interval 
The instantaneous velocity, whose magnitude is the same
as the instantaneous speed, is defined as the average velocity
taken over an infinitesimally short time interval.

We can obtain the velocity of an object at any instant from its graph of x vs. .
For example, in Fig. 2–29 (which shows the same graph as in Figs. 2–27 and 2–28), as
our object moves from

the slope continually increases, so t
