the cation gets smaller, eventually it is no lon-
ger possible to maintain the cationâ€“anion contacts and simultaneously keep the anions 
from touching each other. When this occurs, the coordination number drops from 8 to 
6, and the sodium chloride structure becomes more favorable. As the cation size decreases 
further, eventually the coordination number must be reduced again, this time from 6 to 4, 
and the zinc blende structure becomes favored. Remember that, in ionic crystals, ions of 
opposite charge touch each other but ions of the same charge should not touch.
The relative number of cations and anions also helps determine the most stable 
structure type. All the structures in Figure 12.26 have equal numbers of cations and 
anions. These structure types (cesium chloride, sodium chloride, zinc blende) can be 
realized only for ionic compounds in which the number of cations and anions is equal. 
When this is not the case, other crystal structures must result. As an example, consider
