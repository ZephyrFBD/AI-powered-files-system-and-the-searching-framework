Inserting SI quantities, we have
 P = dhg = 11.00 * 103 kg/m32131.0 m219.81 m>s22
 = 3.00 * 105 kg
m@s2 = 3.00 * 105 Pa
Thus, the total pressure on the diver is
P
total =  98 kPa +  300 kPa =  398 kPa
This corresponds to a pressure of 3.94 atm.
We use various devices to measure the pressures of enclosed gases. Tire gauges, for 
example, measure the pressure of air in automobile and bicycle tires. In laboratories, we 
sometimes use a manometer, which operates on a principle similar to that of a barometer, 
as shown in Sample Exercise 10.2.

10.3 ∣ The Gas Laws
Four variables are needed to define the physical condition, or state, of a gas: temperature, 
pressure, volume, and amount of gas, usually expressed as number of moles. The equa-
tions that express the relationships among these four variables are known as the gas laws. 
Because volume is easily measured, the first gas laws to be studied expressed the
