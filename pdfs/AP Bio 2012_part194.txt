er limiting factor, such as no difference in vapor 
pressure between the leaf interior and the environment. 
(Part d) The student is able to articulate the understanding 
that an adaptation is a trait that an organism possesses 
that increases its fitness within its niche. The student 
demonstrates an understanding of structure and function 
by correctly connecting the organism to its environment but 
has difficulty with justifications. 
Characteristics of a 
WEAK Response 
(Part a) The student is able to draw a graph showing the 
effect of temperature change on the rate of transpiration 
that possesses properly labeled and scaled axes with points 
accurately plotted. The student may either connect the 
points or construct an accurate best-fit line. The student 
is able to write a coherent paragraph with appropriate 
terminology to explain that the shape of the curve from 
23â€“28 degrees demonstrates that the rate of evaporation 
increases with increasing temperature and/or that at high
