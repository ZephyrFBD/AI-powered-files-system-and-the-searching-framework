lution, but then the patient died, and
an autopsy revealed that several of the patient's red blood
cells had burst, would it be true that the injected solution
was really isotonic? Why or why not?
a.
False, the solution was hypertonic.
b.
False, the solution was osmotic.
c.
False, the solution was hypotonic.
d.
True, the solution was isotonic.
24. How does the sodium-potassium pump contribute to
the net negative charge of the interior of the cell?
a.
The sodium-potassium pump forces out three
(positive) Na+
ions for every two (positive)
K+
ions it pumps in, thus the cell loses a net
positive charge of one at every cycle of the
pump.
b.
The sodium-potassium pump expels three ions
K+
for every two Na+
inside the cells,
creating a net positive charge outside the cell
and a net negative charge inside the cell.
c.
The sodium-potassium pump helps the
development of negative charge inside the cell
by making the membrane more permeable to
negatively charged proteins.
d.
The sodium-potassium pu
