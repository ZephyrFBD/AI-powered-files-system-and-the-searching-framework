. A quantity of O2 gas originally at 5.25 atm 
and 26 째C in a 5.00-L container is transferred to this same 
container. What is the total pressure in the new container?
 
10.74  A sample of 3.00 g of SO21g2 originally in a 5.00-L vessel at 
21 째C is transferred to a 10.0-L vessel at 26 째C. A sample of 
2.35 g of N21g2 originally in a 2.50-L vessel at 20 째C is trans-
ferred to this same 10.0-L vessel. (a) What is the partial 
pressure of SO21g2 in the larger container? (b) What is the 
partial pressure of N21g2 in this vessel? (c) What is the total 
pressure in the vessel?

  10.75 Determine whether each of the following changes will in-
crease, decrease, or not affect the rate with which gas mole-
cules collide with the walls of their container: (a) increasing 
the volume of the container, (b) increasing the tempera-
ture, (c) increasing the molar mass of the gas.
