referred to as extranuclear DNA.
DNA and RNA have some structural similarities and structural differences, which are important to their
respective functions. Both will be discussed within this chapter followed by a review of DNA replication.
Structure of DNA and RNA
DNA and RNA are composed of nucleotides. Each nucleotide has three parts: a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon
sugar, and a phosphate group. The nitrogenous bases in DNA are adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. RNA
contains the nitrogenous bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil. These nitrogenous bases are classified into
two groups, as shown in Figure 15.1. Adenine and guanine are purines and consist of a two-ringed structure.
Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are pyrimidines and have a one-ringed structure.
Figure 15.1 Nitrogenous Bases in DNA and RNA
DNA and RNA have consistent base-pairing rules that are seen in all living organisms. In DNA, adenine (A)
pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C).
