Comparison of Mitosis and Meiosis
AP Biology Lab 7: Mitosis and
Meiosis Investigation
In part 1 of this investigation, you will review and model mitosis and
crossing over using simple craȇ materials. Though this part of the
investigation is simple and straightforward, it will help you to recognize,
through hands-on repetition, how genetic material is transferred to
further generations. Genetic material in cells is in chromosomes that
must be condensed to be easily and safely duplicated and moved. This
experiment will also help you to diﬀerentiate between the sister
chromatids, tetrads, and chromosomes and to identify where genetic
material is located.
The next part of the lab provides some hands-on experience working with
real organisms. You will identify diﬀerent cell phases in onion bulbs.
Working with squashes of those onion bulbs, you will explore what
substances in the environment might increase or decrease the rate of
mitosis. The data that is collected
