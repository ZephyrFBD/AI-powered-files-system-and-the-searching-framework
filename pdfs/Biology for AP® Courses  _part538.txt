lic head and two hydrophobic tails. The hydrophilic
head group consists of a phosphate-containing group attached to a glycerol molecule. The hydrophobic tails, each
containing either a saturated or an unsaturated fatty acid, are long hydrocarbon chains.
This characteristic is vital to the structure of a plasma membrane because, in water, phospholipids tend to become arranged
with their hydrophobic tails facing each other and their hydrophilic heads facing out. In this way, they form a lipid

bilayerâ€”a barrier composed of a double layer of phospholipids that separates the water and other materials on one side of
the barrier from the water and other materials on the other side. In fact, phospholipids heated in an aqueous solution tend
to spontaneously form small spheres or droplets (called micelles or liposomes), with their hydrophilic heads forming th
