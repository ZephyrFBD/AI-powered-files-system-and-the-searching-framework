se alpine forest. The population was in the path
of high winds. They plotted the distribution of tree heights to
investigate the selection pressures at work. Which of the following
distributions of tree heights would be expected?
The distribution forms a bell curve because the selection
stabilizes the population to a median height tall enough to
reach for sunlight but not tall enough to be toppled by the
winds.
(A)
The distribution forms a skewed curve toward tall heights
because directional selection favors tall trees that have the
advantage of reaching for sunlight and blocking gusts of
wind.
(B)
The distribution forms a skewed curve toward short heights
because directional selection favors short trees that do not
require as many nutrients from the soil and are not uprooted
by high winds.
(C)
The distribution forms a bimodal curve with extreme heights
more abundant than average heights because tall trees have
the advantage of reaching light and short trees are more
resilient to the w
