Calcium ion is a widely used second messenger. The free concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+) within a cell is very low
because ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously use adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) to remove it. For signaling
purposes, Ca2+ is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. When
signaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of Ca2+ that are present outside the cell (or in
intracellular storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+. The
response to the increase in Ca2+ varies, depending on the cell type involved. For example, in the Î²-cells of the pancreas,
Ca2+ signaling leads to the release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in Ca2+ leads to muscle contractions.
Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic AMP (cAMP). Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the
enzyme a
