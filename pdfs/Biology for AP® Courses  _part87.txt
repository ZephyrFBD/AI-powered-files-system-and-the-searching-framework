 or conference, but this approach can reach only the select few who are present. Instead, most scientists present their
results in peer-reviewed manuscripts that are published in scientific journals. Peer-reviewed manuscripts are scientific
papers that are reviewed by a scientist’s colleagues, or peers. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts

review helps to ensure that the research described in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and

experimental results must be consistent with the findings of other scientists.
A scientific paper is very different from creative wri
