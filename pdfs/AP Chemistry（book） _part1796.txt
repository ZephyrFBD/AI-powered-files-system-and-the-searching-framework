f matter is most easily compressed?
 11.10  (a) How does the average kinetic energy of molecules com-
pare with the average energy of attraction between mole-
cules in solids, liquids, and gases? (b) Why does increasing 
the temperature cause a solid substance to change in suc-
cession from a solid to a liquid to a gas?  (c) What happens 
to a gas if you put it under extremely high pressure?
 11.11  As a metal such as lead melts, what happens to (a) the 
average kinetic energy of the atoms and (b) the average dis-
tance between the atoms?
 11.12  At room temperature, Si is a solid, CCl4 is a liquid, and Ar is a 
gas. List these substances in order of (a) increasing intermo-
lecular energy of attraction and (b) increasing boiling point.
 11.13  At standard temperature and pressure, the molar volumes 
of Cl2 and NH3 gases are 22.06 and 22.40 L, respectively. 
 
(a) Given the different molecular weights, dipole moments, 
and molecular shapes, why are their molar volumes nearly 
the same?
