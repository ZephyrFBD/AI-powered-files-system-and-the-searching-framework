Part I: Fruit Fly Response to Light and Gravity
You begin this investigation by observing the behavior of fruit flies that you have put in a vial. Consider the
following behaviors:
1. Kinesis is an undirected movement in response to a stimulus. The response is a change in the speed of an animal's
movement, often movement from a stationary posture. Insects' scurrying about after lifting a rock is an example of
kinesis.
2. Taxis is a directed movement toward (positive taxis) or away (negative taxis) from a stimulus.
 
Phototaxis is a response to light. Positive phototaxis is movement toward light, and negative phototaxis is
movement away from light.
Geotaxis is a response to gravity and may be positive or negative.
Part II: Fruit Fly Response to Chemicals
In this part of the investigation, you assemble a “choice chamber” in which about 20 to 30 flies respond moving
toward or away from a chemical you put in one end of the chamber. You introduce the ch
