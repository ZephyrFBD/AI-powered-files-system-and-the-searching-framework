actors have different effects. An example of the
former is of a caterpillar population being kept
low by a pesticide because it kills them when
their numbers are low. In the case of the latter, a
large caterpillar population leads to a decrease in
food availability, which will cause the caterpillar
population to decline.

Both are environmental conditions that result in
changes in population numbers. Density-
independent factors have the same effect at all
population densities whereas density-dependent
factors have different effects. An example of the
former is of a caterpillar population being kept
low by a pesticide because it kills them
regardless of their numbers. In the case of the
latter, a large caterpillar population leads to a
decrease in food availability, which will cause
the caterpillar population to increase.

care for its offspring in the way a wolf, which is a K-
selected species, cares for its offspring?
