ideal gas law quite accurately if they are not at too high a pres-

One mole is that amount of a substance whose mass in
grams is numerically equal to the atomic or molecular mass of
that substance.
Avogadro’s number,
is the number of
atoms or molecules in 1 mol of any pure substance.
The ideal gas law can be written in terms of the number of
molecules N in the gas as
(13–4)
where
is Boltzmann’s constant.
According to the kinetic theory of gases, which is based on
the idea that a gas is made up of molecules that are moving
rapidly and randomly, the average translational kinetic energy
of molecules is proportional to the Kelvin temperature T:
(13–8)
where k is Boltzmann’s constant. At any moment, there exists
a wide distribution of molecular speeds within a gas.
