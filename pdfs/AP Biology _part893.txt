Carbon dioxide is a polar molecule and readily diffuses through
the hydrophilic layers of the membrane.
Starch readily diffuses through the membrane into the liver,
where it is stored as glycogen.
Aquaporins are special water channels in the plasma membrane
that facilitate the uptake of large amounts of water without the
expenditure of energy.
Oxygen passes through the cristae of mitochondria mainly
through ATP synthase channels.
Active transport involves the movement of a substance across a
membrane against its concentration or electrochemical gradient.
Active transport is mediated by specific transport proteins and
requires the expenditure of energy. Which of the following
statements describes an example of active transport?
Glucose is transported across some membranes by carrier
proteins down a concentration gradient.
Freshwater protists, such as ameba and paramecia, have
contractile vacuoles that pump out excess water.
