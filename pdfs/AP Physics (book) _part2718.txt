ors can yield
almost any natural color. A good-quality screen consists of millions of pixels.
Behind this array of pixels is a light source, often thin fluorescent tubes the
diameter of a straw, or light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The light passes through the
liquid crystal subpixels, or not, depending on the voltage applied to each, as we
discussed in detail in Section 17–11. See especially Figs. 17–31 and 17–33.
[To obtain a range of gray scale or range of color brightness, each subpixel can-
not simply go on or off as in Fig. 24–51. Several techniques can be used depending
on the construction of the LCD. If the voltage applied in Fig.24–51b is small enough,
the disorientation of the molecules may be small, allowing some rotation of the
polarization vector and thus some light can pass through, the actual amount
depending on the voltage. Alternatively, each subpixel can be pulsed—the length
of time it is on affects the perceived brightness. The effect of stronger or weaker
brightness can
