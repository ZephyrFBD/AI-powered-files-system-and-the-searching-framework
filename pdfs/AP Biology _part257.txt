ctrons from water
to replace those electrons that left PS II. (ENE-1)
(B) ATP synthesis during the light-dependent reactions of
photosynthesis depends on the maintenance of a proton gradient
forming across the thylakoid membrane. Just as in ATP production
in cellular respiration, both processes depend on the fact that protons
can only flow down the gradient across a membrane at ATP
synthase channels. If a chemical were introduced that would make
the thylakoid membrane (or cristae membrane in mitochondria)

permeable to protons, there would be no ATP produced. (ENE-1)
