ure. Pili
(singular: pilus) are shorter structures, some of which are used for
locomotion and others of which play a role in bacterial conjugation,
discussed in the following chapter.
EUKARYOTES
All multicellular organisms (such as you, a tree, or a mushroom) and all
protoctists (such as amoebas and paramecia) are eukaryotic. The
eukaryotes include the protoctists (protists), fungi, animals, and plants.
Eukaryotic cells are enclosed within a lipid bilayer cell membrane, as are
prokaryotic cells. Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells contain
membrane-bound organelles (see figure). An organelle is a structure
within the cell with a specific function that is separated from the rest of
the cell by a membrane. The presence of membrane-bound organelles in
eukaryotes allows eukaryotic cells to compartmentalize activities in
diﬀerent parts of the cell, making them more eﬀicient. Compartments
within a cell allow the cell to carry out activities, such as ATP production
and consumption, within the
