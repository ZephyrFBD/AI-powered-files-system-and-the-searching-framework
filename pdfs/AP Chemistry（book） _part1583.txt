 product PV is a 
constant when a gas is held at constant n and T, we know that
 
P
1V1 = P
2V2 
[10.7]
where P
1 and V1 are initial values and P
2 and V2 are final values. Dividing both sides of this 
equation by P
2 gives the final volume, V2:
 
V2 = V1 * P

P

= 150.0 L2a18.5 atm
1.00 atmb = 925 L 
The answer is reasonable because a gas expands as its pressure decreases.
In a similar way, we can start with the ideal-gas equation and derive relationships 
between any other two variables, V and T (Charles’s law), n and V (Avogadro’s law), or P and T.
We are often faced with the situation in which P, V, and T all change for a fixed num-
ber of moles of gas. Because n is constant in this situation, the ideal-gas equation gives
PV
T
= nR = constant
If we represent the initial and final conditions by subscripts 1 and 2, respectively, we can 
write an equation that is often called the combined gas law:
