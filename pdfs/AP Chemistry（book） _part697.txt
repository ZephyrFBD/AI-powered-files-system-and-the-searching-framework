 2 H2O1l2. When 
hydrogen and oxygen form water at a given temperature, the system loses energy to the 
surroundings. Because energy is lost from the system, the internal energy of the pro 
ducts 
 
(final state) is less than that of the reactants (initial state), and ∆E for the process is negative. 
Thus, the energy diagram in Figure 5.6 shows that the internal energy of the mixture of H2 
and O2 is greater than that of the H2O produced in the reaction.
Relating ∆E to Heat and Work
As we noted in Section 5.1, a system may exchange energy with its surroundings in two gen-
eral ways: as heat or as work. The internal energy of a system changes in magnitude as heat 
is added to or removed from the system or as work is done on or by the system. If we think of 
internal energy as the system’s bank account of energy, we see that deposits or withdrawals 
can be made in the form of either heat or work. Deposits increase the energy of the system 
(positive ∆E), whereas withdrawals decrease the
