d to go across

is
The observer on Earth, Fig. 26–6b, observes the same process. But to this
observer, the spaceship is moving. So the light travels the diagonal path shown
going across the spaceship, reflecting off the mirror, and returning to the sender.
Although the light travels at the same speed to this observer (the second postulate),
it travels a greater distance. Hence the time required, as measured by the observer
on Earth, will be greater than that measured by the observer on the spaceship.
Let us determine the time interval 
measured by the observer on Earth
between sending and receiving the light. In time 
the spaceship travels 
a distance
where v is the speed of the spaceship (Fig. 26–6b). The 
light travels a total distance on its diagonal path (Pythagorean theorem) of
where
Therefore
We square both sides to find
and solve for 
:
so
We combine this equation for 
with the formula for 
above,
:
(26–1a)
Since
is always less than 1, we see that 
That is, the time
