graph, which of the following statements about the hemoglobin
curves is correct?
Hemoglobin B has a greater affinity for oxygen and will
therefore bind more easily to oxygen in the lungs.
Hemoglobin B is characteristic of a mammal that evolved at a
high elevation where oxygen is rare.
When CO2 levels in the blood are high, as shown in
hemoglobin B, hemoglobin releases oxygen more readily.
A is the type found in mammals with a higher
metabolism. Hemoglobin B is characteristic of mammals with a
lower metabolism.
Refer to the figure below.
