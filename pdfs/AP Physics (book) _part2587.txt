The ratio of image height

equals the magnification m of a mirror, is

If the rays that converge to form an image actually pass
through the image, so the image would appear on a screen or
film placed there, the image is said to be a real image. If the
light rays do not actually pass through the image, the image is a
virtual image.
The speed of light v depends on the index of refraction, n, of
the material:
(23;4)
where c is the speed of light in vacuum.
When light passes from one transparent medium into
another, the rays bend or refract. The law of refraction
(Snellâ€™s law) states that

where

are the index of refraction and angle with the
normal (perpendicular) to the surface for the incident ray, and
and 
are for the refracted ray.
When light rays reach the boundary of a material where the
index of refraction decreases, the rays will be totally internally
reflected if the incid
