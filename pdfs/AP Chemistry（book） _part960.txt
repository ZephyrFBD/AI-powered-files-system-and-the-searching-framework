f atoms. In 
1925, the Austrian-born physicist Wolfgang Pauli (1900–1958) discovered the prin-
ciple that governs the arrangement of electrons in many-electron atoms. The Pauli 
exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of 
four quantum numbers n, l, ml, and ms. For a given orbital, the values of n, l, and ml 
are fixed. Thus, if we want to put more than one electron in an orbital and satisfy 
the Pauli exclusion principle, our only choice is to assign different ms values to the 
electrons.  
Because there are only two such values, we conclude that an orbital can 
hold a maximum of two electrons and they must have opposite spins. This restriction 
allows us to index the electrons in an atom, giving their quantum numbers and 
thereby defining the region in space where each electron is most likely to be found. 
It also provides the key to understanding the remarkable structure of the periodic 
table of the elements.
