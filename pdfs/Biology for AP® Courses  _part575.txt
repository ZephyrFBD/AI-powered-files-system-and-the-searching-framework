gh osmolarity has fewer water molecules with respect to solute particles. In a situation in which solutions
of two different osmolarities are separated by a membrane permeable to water, though not to the solute, water will move
from the side of the membrane with lower osmolarity (and more water) to the side with higher osmolarity (and less water).
This effect makes sense if you remember that the solute cannot move across the membrane, and thus the only component in
the system that can move—the water—moves along its own concentration gradient. An important distinction that concerns
living systems is that osmolarity measures the number of particles (which may be molecules) in a solution. Therefore, a
solution that is cloudy with cells may have a lower osmolarity than a solution that is clear, if the second solution contains
more dissolved molecules than there are cells.
