Cheese production began around 4,000â€“7,000 years ago when humans began to breed animals and process their milk.
Fermentation in this case preserves nutrients: Milk will spoil relatively quickly, but when processed as cheese, it is more
stable Evidence suggests that cultured milk products, like yogurt, have existed for at least 4,000 years.
Using Prokaryotes to Clean up Our Planet: Bioremediation
Microbial bioremediation is the use of prokaryotes (or microbial metabolism) to remove pollutants. Bioremediation
has been used to remove agricultural chemicals (pesticides, fertilizers) that leach from soil into groundwater and the
subsurface. Certain toxic metals and oxides, such as selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be removed from water by
bioremediation. The reduction of SeO4-2 to SeO3-2 and to Se0 (metallic selenium) is a method used to remove selenium
