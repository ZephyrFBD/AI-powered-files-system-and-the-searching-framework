f gasoline burned 8.2 kg of CO2
are produced.
SOLUTION
Next, use the density of gasoline to calculate its mass in grams.
To calculate the theoretical yield of carbon dioxide, we must 
write a balanced chemical equation for the combustion of 
C8H18 (octane):
Using the balanced equation and the mass of C8H18, we can 
calculate the theoretical yield of CO2.
12.65 * 103 g C8H182a
1 mol C8H18
114.2 g C8H18
b a 16 mol CO2
2 mol C8H18
b a
44 g CO2
1 mol CO2
b
= 8.2 * 103 g CO2

▲ Figure 18.14 Rising CO2 levels.The sawtooth shape of the graph is due to regular seasonal 
variations in CO2 concentration for each year.
The consensus among climate scientists is that the increase in atmospheric CO2 is 
perturbing Earth’s climate and is very likely playing a role in the observed increase i
