s) represent the
displacement amplitude of the vibrating air in the tube. Note that these are graphs,
and that the air molecules themselves oscillate horizontally, parallel to the tube
length, as shown by the small arrows in the top diagram of Fig. 12–11a (on the
left). The exact position of the antinode near the open end of a tube depends on
the diameter of the tube, but if the diameter is small compared to the length,
which is the usual case, the antinode occurs very close to the end as shown.† We
assume this is the case in what follows. (The position of the antinode may also
depend slightly on the wavelength and other factors.)
Let us look in detail at the open tube, in Fig. 12–11a, which might be an
organ pipe or a flute. An open tube has displacement antinodes at both ends
since the air is free to move at open ends. There must be at least one node within
an open tube if there is to be a standing wave at all. A single node corresponds to
the fundamental frequency of the tube. Since
