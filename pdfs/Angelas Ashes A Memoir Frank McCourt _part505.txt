ade the world, it’s a terrible world, but God 
 
 is good. Good-bye, Francis. Rest your eyes and then read till they fall 
 
 out of your head.We had good times with old Jonathan Swift, didn’t we, 
 
 Francis? 
 
 We did, Mr.Timoney. 
 
 Mam takes me back to the eye ward. She tells me, Don’t be crying 
 
 over Mr.Timoney, he’s not even your father. Besides you’ll be ruining 
 
 your eyes. 
 
 Seamus comes to the ward three times a week and brings new 
 
 poems in his head. He says,You made Patricia sad, Frankie, when you 
 
 didn’t like the one about the owl and the pussycat. 
 
 I’m sorry, Seamus. 
 
 I have it in my head, Frankie, and I’ll say it for you if you don’t say 
 
 ’tis foolish. 
 
 I won’t, Seamus. 
 
 He says the poem and everyone in the ward loves it.They want the 
 
 words and he says it three more times till the whole ward is saying, 
 
 The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea 
 
 In a beautiful pea-green boat. 
 
  
  
 They took some honey, and plenty of money
