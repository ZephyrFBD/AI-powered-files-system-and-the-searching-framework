Life under ice
For a given quantity of gas it is found experimentally that, to a good approxi-
mation, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the absolute pressure
applied to it when the temperature is kept constant. That is,
[constant T]
where P is the absolute pressure (not “gauge pressure”—see Section 10–4). For
example, if the pressure on a gas is doubled, the volume is reduced to half its
original volume. This relation is known as Boyle’s law, after the Englishman
Robert Boyle (1627–1691), who first stated it on the basis of his own experiments.
A graph of P vs. V for a fixed temperature is shown in Fig. 13–14. Boyle’s law can
also be written
