s a joint moves back into position after protraction. Protraction and
retraction can be seen in the movement of the mandible as the jaw is thrust outwards and then back inwards. Elevation is
the movement of a bone upward, such as when the shoulders are shrugged, lifting the scapulae. Depression is the opposite
of elevationâ€”movement downward of a bone, such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their
normal position from an elevated position. Dorsiflexion is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the
knee. Plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted, such as when standing on the toes. Supination is the
movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward. Pronation is the opposite movement,

it possible to grasp and hold objects.
