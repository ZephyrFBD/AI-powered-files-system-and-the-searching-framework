Laws of Probability 
If A and B are 
 
mutually exclusive, then: 
P(A and B) = P(A) ¥  P(B) 
Hardy-Weinberg Equations 
p + q = 1 
x = sample mean  
n  
 
 
= size of the sample 
s = sample standard deviation (i.e., the sample-based 
estimate of the standard deviation of the 
population)  
o = observed results
e = expected results
