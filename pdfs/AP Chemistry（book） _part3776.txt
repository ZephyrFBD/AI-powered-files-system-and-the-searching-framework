electrons for each 3+ ion, assuming a weak-field complex. 
How many unpaired electrons are there in each case?
 23.63  Draw the crystal-field energy-level diagrams and show 
the placement of d electrons for each of the following: 
 
(a) 3Cr(H2O)642+ (four unpaired electrons), (b) 3Mn(H2O)642+ 
(a high-spin complex), (c) 3Ru(NH3)5(H2O)42+ (a low-spin 
complex), (d) 3IrCl642- (a low-spin complex), (e) 3Cr(en)343+, 
(f) 3NiF644-.
 23.64  Draw the crystal-field energy-level diagrams and show 
the placement of electrons for the following com-
plexes: (a) 3VCl643-, (b) 3FeF643- (a high-spin complex), 
 
(c) 3Ru(bipy)343+ (a low-spin complex), (d) 3NiCl442- (tetra-
hedral), (e) 3PtBr642-, (f) 3Ti(en)342+.
 23.65  The complex 3Mn(NH3)642+ contains five unpaired elec-
trons. Sketch the energy-level diagram for the d orbitals, and 
indicate the placement of electrons for this complex ion. Is 
the ion a high-spin or a low-spin complex?
