Amplification of Nucleic Acid Fragments by Polymerase Chain Reaction
Although genomic DNA is visible to the naked eye when it is extracted in bulk, DNA analysis often requires focusing on
one or more specific regions of the genome. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used to amplify specific
regions of DNA for further analysis (Figure 17.4). PCR is used for many purposes in laboratories, such as the cloning of
gene fragments to analyze genetic diseases, identification of contaminant foreign DNA in a sample, and the amplification
of DNA for sequencing. More practical applicati
