e direct enzymatic transfer of
phosphate to ADP. The remainder of the chemical energy is transferred to
NAD+ and FAD (NAD2 + H → NADH; FAD+ + 2H → FADH2). The
reduced coenzymes, NADH and FADH2, shuttle high-energy electrons
into the electron transport chain in the cristae membrane. Figure 6.6
illustrates a simplified version of the citric acid cycle. Here are some other
important points:
ENE-2
Membranes and membrane-bound organelles localize metabolic processes and specific
reactions.
In the first step, acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetic acid (OAA
or oxaloacetate) to produce citric acid, hence, the name citric acid
cycle.
Remember that each molecule of glucose is broken down to 2
molecules of pyruvate during glycolysis. Therefore, the respiration
of each molecule of glucose causes the Krebs cycle to turn two
times.
Before it enters the Krebs cycle, pyruvate must first combine with
coenzyme A (a vitamin) to form acetyl-CoA, which does enter the
Krebs cycle. The conversion of pyruvate
