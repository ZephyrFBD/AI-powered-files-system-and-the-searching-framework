ose you take a solution and add more solvent, so that 
the original mass of solvent is doubled. You take this new 
solution and add more solute, so that the original mass of the 
solute is doubled. What happens to the molality of the final 
solution, compared to the original molality?
(a) It is doubled.
(b) It is decreased by half.
(c) It is unchanged.
(d) It will increase or decrease depending on the molar mass of 
the solute.
(e) There is no way to tell without knowing the molar mass of 
the solute.
 
â–¶Practice Exercise 2
What is the molality of a solution made by dissolving 36.5 g 
of naphthalene 1C10H82 in 425 g of toluene 1C7H82?
Mol C6H12O6 = 14.35 g C6H12O62a
1 mol C6H12O6
180.2 g C6H12O6
b = 0.0241 mol C6H12O6
Molality of C6H12O6 =
0.0241 mol C6H12O6
0.0250 kg H2O
= 0.964 m

Sample Exercise 13.4 
Calculation of Molality
Because water has a density of 1.00 g>mL, 
the mass of the solvent is:
Finally, use Equation 13.9 to obtain
