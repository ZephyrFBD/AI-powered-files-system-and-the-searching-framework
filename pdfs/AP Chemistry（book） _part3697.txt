Isomerism
When two or more compounds have the same com-
position but a different arrangement of atoms, we 
call them isomers. 
 (Section 2.9) Here we con-
sider two main kinds of isomers in coordination 
compounds: structural isomers (which have dif-
ferent bonds) and stereoisomers (which have the 
same bonds but different ways in which the ligands 
occupy the space around the metal center). Each 
of these classes also has subclasses, as shown in 
 
Figure 23.19.
Structural Isomerism
Many types of structural isomerism are known 
in coordination chemistry, including the two 
named in Figure 23.19: linkage isomerism and 
 
coordination-sphere isomerism. Linkage isom-
erism is a relatively rare but interesting type that 
arises when a particular ligand is capable of coor-
dinating to a metal in two ways. The nitrite ion, 
NO2
-, for example, can coordinate to a metal ion 
through either its nitrogen or one of its oxygens 
(Figure 23.20). When it coordinates through the 
nitroge
