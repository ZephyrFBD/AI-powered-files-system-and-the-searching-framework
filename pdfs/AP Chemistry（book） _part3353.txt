Give It Some Thought
Which type of radioactive decay converts a neutron into a proton?
Write nuclear equations for (a) mercury-201 undergoing electron capture; (b) thorium-231 decaying to protactinium-231.
Sample Exercise 21.2 
Writing Nuclear Equations
SOLUTION
Analyze We must write balanced nuclear equations in which the 
masses and charges of reactants and products are equal.
Plan We can begin by writing the complete chemical symbols for 
the nuclei and decay particles that are given in the problem.
