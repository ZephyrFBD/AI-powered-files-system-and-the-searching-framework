to two chromatids. Each chromatid is complete with a centromere and a kinetochore. Once
separated from its sister chromatid, each chromatid is called a chromosome. (To count the number of chromosomes
at any one time, count the number of centromeres.)
3. Anaphase (separation) begins after the chromosomes are separated into chromatids. During anaphase, the
microtubules connected to the chromatids (now chromosomes) shorten, effectively pulling the chromosomes to
opposite poles. The microtubules shorten as tubulin units are uncoupled at their chromosome ends. Overlapping
microtubules originating from opposite MTOCs, but not attached to chromosomes, interact to push the poles farther
apart. At the end of anaphase, each pole has a complete set of chromosomes, the same number of chromosomes as
the original cell. (Since they consist of only one chromatid, each chromosome contains only a single copy of the
DNA molecule.)
4. Telophase (restoration) concludes the nuclear division. During this pha
