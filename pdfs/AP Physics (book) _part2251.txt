ollows the path efgb, again approaching
saturation at point b.
Notice that the field did not pass through the origin (point a) in this cycle.
The fact that the curve does not retrace itself on the same path is called hysteresis.
The curve bcdefgb is called a hysteresis loop. In such a cycle, much energy is
transformed to thermal energy (friction) due to realigning of the domains. Note
that at points c and f, the iron core is magnetized even though there is no current
in the coils. These points correspond to a permanent magnet.

A magnet has two poles, north and south. The north pole is that
end which points toward geographic north when the magnet is
freely suspended. Like poles of two magnets repel each other,
whereas unlike poles attract.
We can picture that a magnetic field surrounds every mag-
net. The SI unit for magnetic field is the tesla (T).
Electric currents produce magnetic fields. For example,
the lines of magnetic field due to a current in a straight wire
