n a number of new concepts, including 
the delocalization of p systems of molecules and the molecular 
orbital description of molecular bonding. A connection between 
these concepts is provided by the field of organic dyes, molecules 
with delocalized p systems that have color. The color is due to the 
excitation of an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital 
(HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). It is hy-
pothesized that the energy gap between the HOMO and the LUMO 
depends on the length of the p system. Imagine that you are given 
samples of the following substances to test this hypothesis:

b-Carotene is the substance chiefly responsible for the bright orange 
color of carrots. It is also an important nutrient for the body’s pro-
duction of retinal (see the “Chemistry and Life” box in Section 9.6).
