†One way to form the pn boundary at the nanometer thicknesses on chips is to implant (or diffuse) 
n-type donor atoms into the surface of a p-type semiconductor, converting a layer of the p-type
semiconductor into n-type.
A graph of current versus voltage for a typical diode is shown in Fig. 29–30.
A forward bias greater than 0.6 V allows a large current to flow. In reverse bias,
a real diode allows a small amount of reverse current to flow; for most practical
purposes, it is negligible.†
The symbol for a diode is
[diode]
where the arrow represents the direction conventional 
current flows readily.
A diode. The diode whose current–voltage characteristics
are shown in Fig. 29–30 is connected in series with a 4.0-V battery in forward
bias and a resistor. If a current of 15 mA is to pass through the diode, what resis-
tance must the resistor have?
APPROACH We use Fig. 29–30, where we see that the voltage drop across the
diode is about 0.7 V when the current is 15 m
