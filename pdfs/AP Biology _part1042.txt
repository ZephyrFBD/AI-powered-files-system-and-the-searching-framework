s would not be able to separate
correctly, and normal gametes would not be produced.
While the newly formed mRNA is still in the nucleus, it is
altered or processed. Editing molecules called snRNPs and
spliceosomes splice out introns from the pre-RNA strand. Also,
a 5' cap is added to the 5' end to help the RNA strand bind to the
ribosome. In addition, a poly-A tail is added to the 3' end to
protect from degradation by hydrolytic enzymes in the
cytoplasm. The mature mRNA is shorter than the pre-RNA.
If different introns were removed from the primary RNA
transcript, different proteins will be formed from the same
original stretch of DNA. The process is known as alternative

splicing. Referring to the figured provided, if exons 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 5 get transcribed, the protein alpha-globin will be
produced. If exons 1, 3, and 5 gets transcribed, a different
protein will be formed.
Exons are discontinuous sequences of DNA tha
