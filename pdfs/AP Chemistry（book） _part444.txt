stance is summarized in Figure 3.12.  We must con-
vert 5.23 g to moles of C6H12O6 and then convert moles to molecules 
of C6H12O6. The first conversion uses the molar mass of C6H12O6, 
180.0 g/mol, and the second conversion uses Avogadroâ€™s number.
(b) To determine the number of O atoms, we use the fact that there are 
six O atoms in each C6H12O6 molecule. Thus, multiplying the number 
of molecules we calculated in (a) by the factor (6 atoms O>1 molecule 
C6H12O6) gives the number of O atoms.
Solve 
(a)  
Convert grams C6H12O6 to 
molecules C6H12O6.
Molecules C6H12O6 = 15.23 g C6H12O62a
1 mol C6H12O6
180.0 g C6H12O6
b a
6.02 * 1023 molecules C6H12O6
1 mol C6H12O6
b 
 = 1.75 * 1022 molecules C6H12O6
(b)  
Convert molecules C6H12O6 
to atoms O.
Check 
(a) Because the mass we began with is less than a mole, there 
should be fewer than 6.02 * 1023 molecules in the sample,  
which means the magnitude of our answer is reasonable.  
A ballpark estimate of the answer comes reasonably close to
