FIGURE 16–39 (a) Schematic diagram of a section of DNA
double helix. (b) “Close-up” view of the helix, showing how 
A and T attract each other and how G and C attract each other
through electrostatic forces. The 
and 
signs indicated on
certain atoms represent net charges, usually a fraction of e,
due to uneven sharing of electrons. The red dots indicate the
electrostatic attraction (often called a “weak bond” or
“hydrogen bond”—Section 29–3). Note that there are two
weak bonds between A and T, and three between C and G.

CHAPTER 16
Electric Charge and Electric Field
The electrostatic force between A and T, and between C and G, exists because
these molecules have charged parts. These charges are due to some electrons in
each of these molecules spending more time orbiting one atom than another.
For example, the el
