e membrane
functions. Proteins act as transport molecules, receptor sites,
attachments to the cytoskeleton, and surface enzymes. Carbohydrates
on the surface of the cell and glycoproteins contribute to cell recognition,
particularly in immune response. Cholesterol helps to maintain the
fluidity of the membrane.
MEMBRANE PROTEINS
Membrane proteins, like the membrane phospholipids, usually have
carbohydrate groups attached to them so that the outside surface of the
plasma membrane is extremely sugar-rich.
Membrane-spanning proteins have regions that are hydrophobic as well
as regions that are hydrophilic, with the nonpolar (hydrophobic) regions
passing through the nonpolar interior of the membrane and the polar
areas sticking both into the cytoplasm and out into the extracellular
space. Other proteins can be located completely intracellularly or
extracellularly, anchored to the cell membrane by a variety of special
lipids. These proteins are made in the cytosol and bind into the cell
