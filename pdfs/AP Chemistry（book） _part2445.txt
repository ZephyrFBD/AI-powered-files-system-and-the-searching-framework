It’s instructive to consider shifts in equilibrium through the lens 
of Equation 15.27.  If the reaction in question is an endothermic reac-
tion, a decrease in temperature will lead to a decrease in K, thereby 
shifting the equilibrium to the left. Equation 15.27 tells us that in 
order for K to decrease, the rate constant of the forward reaction kf 
must decrease by a larger amount than the rate constant of the reverse 
reaction kr.
To understand why kf decreases faster than kr consider the rela-
tionship between reaction rate and activation energy, Ea.  For the sake 
of illustration, consider the effect of decreasing the temperature from 
T1 = 400 K to T2 = 300 K. We can calculate the change in the for-
ward rate constant using Equation 14.23:
