y errors in mRNA are not as potentially
harmful as errors in the DNA sequence.
Termination is the final stage in transcription. Elongation
continues for a short distance after the RNA polymerase transcribes
the termination sequence (AAUAAA). At this point, mRNA is cut
free from the DNA template.
RNA Processing
Before the newly formed pre-RNA strand is shipped out of the nucleus to
the ribosome in the cytoplasm, it is altered or processed by a series of
enzymes. Here are the details.
A 5′ cap consisting of a modified guanine nucleotide is added to the
5′ end. This cap helps the RNA strand bind to the ribosome in the
cytoplasm during translation.
A poly (A) tail, consisting of a string of adenine nucleotides, is
added to the 3′ end. This tail protects the RNA strand from
degradation by hydrolytic enzymes, and facilitates the release of
mRNA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.
Noncoding regions of the mRNA called introns or intervening
sequences are removed or spliced out by snRNPs, smal
