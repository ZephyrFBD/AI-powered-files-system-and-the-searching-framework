Step 1 Using clean 16 x 150 mL test tubes, make six sets of pairs of original substrate and 
enzyme tubes for a total of 12 tubes or 6 pairs. This time you will substitute a different 
pH buffer for the distilled water used in the original enzyme tubes. Prepare the tubes as 
follows and be sure to label them. 
•  For each substrate tube in a pair, add 7 mL of distilled water, 0.3 mL of hydrogen 
peroxide, and 0.2 mL of guaiacol for a total volume of 7. 5 mL. 
•  For each enzyme tube in the pair, add 6.0 mL of a specific pH solution and 1.5 mL of 
peroxidase for a total volume of 7.5 mL. For example, in the enzyme tube of the first 
pair, you can substitute 6.0 mL of buffer solution of pH 3 for the distilled water; in the 
enzyme tube of the second pair, you c
