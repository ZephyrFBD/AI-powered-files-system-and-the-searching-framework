t was passed through a prism to shine different colors of light onto the photosynthetic
algae Spirogyra (that was placed on a microscope slide), as shown in the following figure.
Aerobic bacteria (that need oxygen to survive) were layered on top of the algae. The wavelengths (in nm) of
different colors of visible light are noted in the table.
Color of Visible Light
Wavelength (nm)
Violet
380–450
Blue
450–495
Green
495–570
Yellow
570–590
Orange
590–620
Red
620–750
16. The greatest numbers of aerobic bacteria were found on the slide where the wavelength of light was between
420–470 nm and 660–700 nm. What conclusion could be drawn from this data?
(A) Algae produce the same amount of oxygen when exposed to any color of light.
(B) Algae produce oxygen only when in the presence of aerobic bacteria.
(C) Algae produce the most oxygen when exposed to green light.
(D) Algae produce the most oxygen when exposed to blue-violet or red light.
17. Further research revealed that the light-absorbing p
