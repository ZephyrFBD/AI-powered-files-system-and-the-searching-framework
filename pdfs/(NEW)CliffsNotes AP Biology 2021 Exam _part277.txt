ge, black, and white hair, randomly arranged in patches over
their bodies. The orange and black colors are determined by a gene on the X chromosome (the white color is
controlled by a different gene). When the X chromosome with the orange allele is inactivated, the black color allele
on the active chromosome is expressed, and the hair is black. In other patches, the chromosome with the black allele
may be inactivated, and those patches will be orange.
What does this mean for sex-linked genetic disorders in humans, such as
color blindness? A carrier female (XNXn) should usually be normal with respect to this trait, because all or at least
some cells will have XN activated and produce normal functioning color vision. However, in the very unlikely case
that all of the relevant cells have XNinactivated, the carrier female should express the same symptoms of color
blindness as a male.
Nondisjunction
Nondisjunction is the failure of one or more chromosome pairs or chromatids of a single chro
