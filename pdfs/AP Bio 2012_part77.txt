 4. Populations of a plant species have been found growing in the mountains at altitudes above 2,500 meters. 
Populations of a plant that appears similar, with slight differences, have been found in the same mountains at 
altitudes below 2,300 meters.  
(a) Describe TWO kinds of data that could be collected to provide a direct answer to the question, do the 
populations growing above 2,500 meters and the populations growing below 2,300 meters represent a single 
species?  
(b) Explain how the data you suggested in part (a) would provide a direct answer to the question.

 5. In eukaryotic cells, ribosomes are found both free in the cytosol and attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 
Proteins produced on the attached ribosomes are delivered to the ER, while proteins produced on free ribosomes 
are delivered to the cytosol. Briefly explain in one or two sentences the two processes in terms
