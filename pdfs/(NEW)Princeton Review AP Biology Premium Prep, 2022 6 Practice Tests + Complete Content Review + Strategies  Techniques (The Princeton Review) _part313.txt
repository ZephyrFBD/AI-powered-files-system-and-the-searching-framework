each chromosome is a duplicated chromosome, which consists of
two chromatids.
Meiosis II
The purpose of the second meiotic division is to separate sister chromatids, and the process is virtually identical to
mitosis. Letâ€™s run through the steps of meiosis II.
During prophase II, chromosomes once again condense and become visible. In metaphase II, chromosomes move
toward the metaphase plate. This time they line up single file, not as pairs. During anaphase II, chromatids of each
chromosome split at the centromere, and each chromatid is pulled to opposite ends of the cell. At telophase II, a
nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromosomes and a total of four haploid cells are produced.
Gametogenesis
Meiosis is also known as gametogenesis. If sperm cells are produced, then meiosis is called spermatogenesis.
During spermatogenesis, four sperm cells are produced for each diploid cell. If an egg cell or an ovum is produced,
this process is called oogenesis.
Oogenesis is a little differ
