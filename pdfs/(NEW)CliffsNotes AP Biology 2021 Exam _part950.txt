he introns of a primary RNA transcript varies dramatically, from
hundreds to hundreds of thousands of nucleotides. The intron nucleotides are removed by snRNPs during RNA
splicing (processing of RNA while still in the nucleus), thus reducing the length of the final RNA considerably. A
DNA segment with a point mutation (a single nucleotide replaced, added, or deleted) will differ from the original
DNA segment by, at most, only one nucleotide. The primary RNA transcript, containing both introns and exons, will
contain the same number of nucleotides as the original DNA segment.
30. D. Although disease, competition, and carrying capacity each could be responsible for the decline between 18
and 30 months, no data to support these hypotheses are provided. The only answer that is supported by the provided
data is that the rate of growth is zero at 18 months and 30 months
31. D. The bands and centromere of the chromosome segment in box 2 of the orangutan are in reverse order
