ucose catabolism; it
is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight in the process of
photophosphorylation. Recall that the production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis in mitochondria is called
oxidative phosphorylation. The overall result of these reactions is the production of ATP from the energy of the electrons
removed from hydrogen atoms. These atoms were originally part of a glucose molecule. At the end of the pathway, the
electrons are used to reduce an oxygen molecule to oxygen ions. The extra electrons on the oxygen attract hydrogen ions
(protons) from the surrounding medium, and water is formed.

Figure 7.13 In oxidative phosphorylation, the pH gradient formed by the electron transport chain is used by ATP
synthase to form ATP.
Cyanide inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, a component of the electron transport chain. If cyanide poisoning occurs,
would you expect the pH of the intermembran
