Equation 5.22 makes it possible to calculate qrxn from the temperature change of the 
solution in which the reaction occurs. A temperature increase 1∆T 7 02 means the reac-
tion is exothermic 1qrxn 6 02.
Sample Exercise 5.6 
Measuring 횫H Using a Coffee-Cup Calorimeter
When a student mixes 50 mL of 1.0 M HCl and 50 mL of 1.0 M NaOH in a coffee-cup calorimeter, the temperature of the 
resultant solution increases from 21.0 to 27.5 °C. Calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction in kJ>mol HCl, assuming 
that the calorimeter loses only a negligible quantity of heat, that the total volume of the solution is 100 mL, that its density is 
1.0 g>mL, and that its specific heat is 4.18 J>g@K.
SOLUTION
Analyze Mixing solutions of HCl and NaOH results in an acid-base 
reaction:
HCl1aq2 + NaOH1aq2 ¡  H2O1l2 + NaCl1aq2
We need to calculate the heat produced per mole of HCl, given the 
temperature increase of the solution, the number of moles of HCl and 
NaOH involved, and the density and specific
