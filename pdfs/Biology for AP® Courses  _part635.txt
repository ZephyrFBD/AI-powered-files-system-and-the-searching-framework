following is the correct explanation for the data?
a.
At higher osmolarity, lower rates of contraction
are required because more salt diffuses into the
Paramecium.
b.
In an isosmotic salt solution, there is no
diffusion of water into or out of the
Paramecium, so the contraction rate is zero.
c.
The contraction rate increases as the osmolarity
decreases because the amount of water entering
the Paramecium by osmosis increases.
d.
The contractile vacuole is less efficient in
solutions of high osmolarity because of the
reduced amount of ATP produced from cellular
respiration.
33. What is most likely to happen if Paramecia are moved
from a hypertonic solution to solutions of decreasing
osmolarity?
a.
The rate of contraction would increase with
decreasing osmolarity because more water
diffuses into the Paramecium.
b.
The rate of contraction would decrease with
decreasing osmolarity because more water
diffuses into the Paramecium.
c.
The rate of contraction would increase with
decreasing osmo
