Learning Objective 
1.15: The student is able to describe specific examples of 
conserved core biological processes and features shared by 
all domains or within one domain of life, and how these 
shared, conserved core processes and features support the 
concept of common ancestry for all organisms.
(A)
This option is incorrect. Glycolysis does not occur in the mitochondria. Archaea 
and Bacteria do not contain mitochondria.
(B)
This option is correct because it demonstrates understanding of the processes 
of evolution and glycolysis, which is common to both aerobic and anaerobic 
respiration.
(C)
This option is incorrect. Many organisms rely on aerobic respiration for ATP 
production. 
(D)
This option is incorrect. There is no evidence for any other energy-producing 
process that substitutes for and predates glycolysis.
