ff switch: the voltage on the gate terminal acts to control the
conductivity between the source and the drain terminals, thus allowing current
to flow (or not) between them.
Each memory “cell,”which in DRAM consists of one transistor and a capacitor,
stores one bit (
a “0” or a “1”). Each cell is extremely small physically, less than
100 nm across.‡ Typical DRAM chips (integrated circuits) contain billions of
these memory cells. To see how they work, we look at a tiny part, the simple four-
cell array shown in Fig. 21–29. One side of each cell capacitor is grounded; the
other side is connected to the transistor source. The drain of each transistor is
connected to a very thin conducting wire or “line,” a bit-line, that runs across the 
array of cells. Each gate is connected to a word-line. A particular bit is a “1” or
a “0” depending on whether the capacitor of the cell is charged to a voltage V
(maybe 5 V) or is at zero (uncharged, or at a very small voltage).
