 they are affected by 
environmental factors, such as enzyme or 
substrate concentration, pH, temperature, 
and the presence of inhibitors.
As students learn about cellular respiration 
and photosynthesis, be sure to emphasize 
the differences between the two processes, 
how they function together within an 
ecosystem, and the consequences of a 
disruption in either process on a cellular, 
organismal, and ecosystem level.
Preparing for the AP Exam 
Students often lack an understanding of 
metabolic pathways, confusing them with 
other processes. Students should know 
inputs and outputs of metabolic pathways, 
predict how changes in reactants affect 
them, and explain how organisms and 
ecosystems are affected by changes.
Common misconceptions include: only 
animals conduct cellular respiration, oxygen 
is created during photosynthesis, and only 
plants conduct photosynthesis. Be sure 
to make clear the distinction between 
memorizing molecules and demonstrating 
an understanding of how
