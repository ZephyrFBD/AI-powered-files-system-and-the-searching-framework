hromosomes normally separate to opposite poles of the cell
during meiosis. Recombination involves the exchange of material
between chromosomes but does not itself alter the number of
chromosomes in gametes, so (B) is also incorrect. (C) is incorrect
because chromatids are supposed to separate during anaphase II; only
the failure to separate properly could cause a discrepancy in
chromosome number.

Except in a very small number of cell types (e.g., erythrocytes and
platelets), mitosis results in complete copies of genetic information
being passed along to both daughter cells equally, so (A) is correct.
Most diﬀerences in the structure and function of daughter cells are
attributable primarily to the diﬀerent mRNA and protein contents
between the two cells, and not to the presence, absence, or direct
modification of genetic material. Thus, (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect.
