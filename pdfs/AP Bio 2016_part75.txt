dard error of the mean was smaller 
than that for treatment group V. 
 
35. To investigate whether an organism in the study is 
capable of both photosynthesis and respiration, a 
comparison of which treatment groups is most 
appropriate? 
(A) I and II 
(B) II and IV 
(C) III and V 
(D) IV and VI 
 
36. The results for treatment groups V and VI could 
suggest which of the following questions about 
the design of the experiment? 
(A) Do the glass beakers prevent light from 
reaching the test samples? 
(B) Is the method used for measuring pH harmful 
to aquatic organisms? 
(C) Is the availability of carbon dioxide a limiting 
factor in aquatic ecosystems? 
(D) Does the aquarium water contain living 
microorganisms? 
 
37. Which of the following modifications to the 
experimental design will best help reduce the  
standard errors of the means? 
(A) Using pond water instead of aquarium water  
(B) Exposing samples to light for a greater 
amount of time 
(C) Increasing the sample size of eac
