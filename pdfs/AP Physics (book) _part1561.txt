ns and the polar ice caps (see Fig. 14–12)
depends on this 
factor in Eq. 14–8. The seasons are not a result of how close
the Earth is to the Sun—in fact, in the Northern Hemisphere, summer occurs
when the Earth is farthest from the Sun. It is the angle (i.e.,
) that really mat-
ters. Furthermore, the reason the Sun heats the Earth more at midday than at
sunrise or sunset is also related to this 
factor.

Getting a tan—energy absorption. What is
the rate of energy absorption from the Sun by a person lying flat on the beach
on a clear day if the Sun makes a 30° angle with the vertical? Assume that
and that 
reaches the Earth’s surface.
APPROACH We use Eq. 14–8 and estimate a typical human to be roughly 2 m
tall by 0.4 m wide, so
See Fig. 14–11.
SOLUTION Since
we have
NOTE If a person wears light-colored clothing,
is much smaller, so the energy
absorbed is less.
