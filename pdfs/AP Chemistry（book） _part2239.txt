buted in energy over a wide 
range. 
 (Section 10.7) Figure 14.17 shows the distribution of kinetic energies for two 
temperatures, comparing them with the minimum energy needed for reaction, Ea. At the 
higher temperature a much greater fraction of the molecules have kinetic energy greater 
than Ea, which leads to a greater rate of reaction.
Give It Some Thought
Suppose we have two reactions, A ¡ B and B ¡ C. You can isolate B, and it 
is stable. Is B the transition state for the reaction A ¡ C?
For a collection of molecules in the gas phase, the fraction of molecules that have 
kinetic energy equal to or greater than Ea is given by the expression
 
f = e-Ea>RT 
[14.20]
In this equation, R is the gas constant 18.314 J>mol@K2 and T is the absolute temperature. To 
get an idea of the magnitude of f, let’s suppose that Ea is 100 kJ>mol, a value typical of many 
reactions, and that T is 300 K. The calculated value of f is 3.9 * 10-18, an extremely small 
number! At 320 K, f = 4.7 * 10-17.
