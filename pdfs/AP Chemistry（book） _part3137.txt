 is true or 
false. If it is false, correct it. (a) The feasibility of manufac-
turing NH3 from N2 and H2 depends entirely on the value 
of ∆H  for the process N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ¡ 2 NH31g2.  
(b) The reaction of Na(s) with Cl21g2 to form NaCl(s) is a 
spontaneous process. (c) A spontaneous process can in prin-
ciple be conducted reversibly. (d) Spontaneous processes in 
general require that work be done to force them to proceed. 
(e) Spontaneous processes are those that are exothermic 
and that lead to a higher degree of order in the system.
 19.88  For each of the following processes, indicate whether the 
signs of ∆S and ∆H are expected to be positive, negative, 
or about zero. (a) A solid sublimes. (b) The temperature of 
a sample of Co(s) is lowered from 60 °C to 25 °C. (c) Ethyl 
alcohol evaporates from a beaker. (d) A diatomic molecule 
dissociates into atoms. (e) A piece of charcoal is combusted 
to form CO21g2 and H2O1g2.
 19.89  The reaction 2 Mg1s2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 MgO1s2 is highly
