above and below the internuclear axis, constitute a single p bond.

▲ Figure 9.21 Trigonal-planar molecular 
geometry of ethylene. The double bond 
is made up of one C¬C s bond and one 
C¬ C p bond.
In almost all cases, single bonds are s bonds. A double bond consists of one s bond 
and one p bond, and a triple bond consists of one s bond and two p bonds:

Consider ethylene 1C2H42, which has a C “C double bond. As illustrated by the ball-
and-stick model of Figure 9.21, the three bond angles about each carbon are all approx-
imately 120°, suggesting that each carbon atom uses sp2 hybrid orbitals (Figure 9.16) to 
form s bonds with the other carbon a
