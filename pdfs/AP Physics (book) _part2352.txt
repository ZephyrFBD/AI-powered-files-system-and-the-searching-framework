 upper left cell in Fig. 21–29, word-line-1 is given
a high enough pulse of voltage to “turn on” the transistor. That is, the high gate
voltage attracts charge and allows bit-line-1 and the capacitor to be connected. Thus
charge can flow from bit-line-1 to the capacitor, charging it either to V or to 0,
depending on the bit-line-1 voltage at that moment, thus writing a “1” or a “0”.
The lower left cell in Fig. 21–29 can be written at the same time by setting
bit-line-2 voltage to V or zero.
Now let us see a simple way to read a cell. In order to read the data stored
(“1” or “0”) on the upper left cell, a voltage of about 
is given to bit-line-1.
Then word-line-1 is given enough voltage to turn on the transistor and connect
bit-line-1 to the capacitor. The capacitor, if uncharged (
“0”), will now drag
charge from bit-line-1 and the bit-line voltage will drop below
If the capacitor
is already charged to 
(
“1”), the connection to bit-line-1 will raise bit-line-1’s
voltage to above
