A natural way to do this is to restrict the domain to the interval  
 
We see that sine is one-to-one on this restricted domain (by the Horizontal Line Test) and 
so has an inverse. 
 
We can now define an inverse sine function on this restricted domain. The graph of y = sin-
1x is obtained by reflecting the graph of y=sin x in the line y=x.

The inverse sine function is also called arcsine, denoted by arcsin. 
In fact, from the general properties of inverse functions, we have the following 
cancellation properties.

3.5.3 The Inverse Cosine Function 
If the domain of the cosine function is restricted to the interval [0,  ], the resulting function 
is one-to-one and so has an inverse. 
We choose this interval because on it, cosine attains each of its values exactly once.
