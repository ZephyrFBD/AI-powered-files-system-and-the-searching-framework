photon must enter your eye or some other detector. When a photon strikes an
ordinary-sized object, it only slightly alters the motion or position of the object.

FIGURE 28–4 Young’s double-slit
experiment done with electrons—
note that the pattern is not evident
with only a few electrons (top
photo), but with more and more
electrons (second and third photos),
the familiar double-slit interference
pattern (Chapter 24) is seen.
But a photon striking a tiny object like an electron transfers enough momentum
to greatly change the electron’s motion and position in an unpredictable way. The
mere act of measuring the position of an object at one time makes our knowledge
of its future position imprecise.
Now let us see where the wave–particle duality comes in. Imagine a thought
experiment in which we are trying to measure the position of an object, say an
electron, with photons, Fig. 28–5. (The arguments would be s
