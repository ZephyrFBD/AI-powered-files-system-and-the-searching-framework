ounds. Chemotrophs that can use organic compounds as energy sources are called
chemoorganotrophs. Those that can also use inorganic compounds as energy sources are called chemolithotrophs.
The Ways in Which Prokaryotes Obtain Carbon
Prokaryotes not only can use different sources of energy but also different sources of carbon compounds. Recall that
organisms that are able to fix inorganic carbon are called autotrophs. Autotrophic prokaryotes synthesize organic molecules
from carbon dioxide. In contrast, heterotrophic prokaryotes obtain carbon from organic compounds. To make the picture
more complex, the terms that describe how prokaryotes obtain energy and carbon can be combined. Thus, photoautotrophs
use energy from sunlight, and carbon from carbon dioxide and water, whereas chemoheterotrophs obtain energy and carbon
from an organic chemical source. Chemolitoautotrophs obtain their energy from inorganic compounds, and they build
their complex molecules from carbon dioxide. The table be
