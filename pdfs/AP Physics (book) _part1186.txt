en any two successive identical points on the wave. The frequency, f,
is the number of crests—or complete cycles—that pass a given point per unit time.
The period, T, equals 1/f and is the time elapsed between two successive crests
passing by the same point in space.

Types of Waves and Their Speeds: Transverse and Longitudinal

The wave speed, v, is the speed at which wave crests (or any other fixed 
point on the wave shape) move forward. The wave speed must be distinguished 
from the speed of a particle of the medium itself as we saw in Example 11–10.
A wave crest travels a distance of one wavelength,
in a time equal to one
period, T. Thus the wave speed is
Then, since

For example, suppose a wave has a wavelength
