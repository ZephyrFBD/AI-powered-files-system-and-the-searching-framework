e development of the main factors. 
 Relationship. When we think about the index of the main factors, we take the 
influence between main factors into consideration instead of merely thinking 
about the main factor itself. 
 Comprehensiveness. We use analytic hierarchy process model, dynamic 
weighted comprehensive model and connection model across in order to make 
our efforts to ensure that the index can reflect both quantity difference between 
factors and quality difference in each link. At the same time, this can highlight the 
connection well. 
 Capability. Our model can evaluate various sorts of indexes. As long as 
something can be located accurately, it can be an influence factor. For example, 
we can put people's happiness index into the realm of social factors. 
 Convenience. The replacement and increase of sub models are extremely

when adding additional uncertain factors.
