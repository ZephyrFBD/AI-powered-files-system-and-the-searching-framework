r than that in NaF and smaller 
than that in KCl. We would thus expect the lattice energy of KF 
to be between 701 and 910 kJ/mol. Figure 8.7 The repulsions 
between the nuclei would decrease, the attractions between the 
nuclei and the electrons would decrease, and the repulsions between 
the electrons would be unaffected. Figure 8.8 The electronegativ-
ity decreases with increasing atomic number. Figure 8.10 m will 
decrease. Figure 8.11 The bonds are not polar enough to cause 
enough excess electron density on the halogen atom to lead to a

density might leak over and start to fill the 3d orbitals as well. The 4p 
orbitals should be empty. Figure 12.24 Ionic substances cleave 
because the nearest neighbor interactions switch from attractive to 
repulsive if the atoms slide so that ions of like charge (cation–cation 
and anion–anion) touch each other. Metals don’t cleave because the 
atoms are attracted to all other atoms in the crystal through metal-
