 add 10 mL 1% phenolphthalein; if the agar solution is 
clear, add dilute NaOH until the agar is bright pink. 
4. Pour the agar into baking pans or shallow trays to 3 cm deep; let the agar cool 
overnight. 
Have students make cubes (1 cm per side, 2 cm per side). Some students will think to 
make the pieces long and thin. 
Tip: If the agar loses its color, simply place into dilute NaOH for a few hours. 
To prepare NaOH and HCl, do the following: 
1. 0.1 M NaOH: Add 0.4 g of NaOH to 80 mL of H2O. Stir to dissolve and add water 
to 100 mL total volume. Store NaOH solutions in plastic bottles. Label Hazardous-
Caustic Solution. 
2. 0.1 M HCl: Add 0.83 mL of concentrated HCl (12.1 M) to H2O to bring to 100 mL 
total volume. Label Hazardous-Strong Acid. 
An alternative method calls for mixing one packet of unflavored gelatin with 237 mL 
of water and adding 2.5 mL 1% phenolphthalein and a few drops of 0.1 M NaOH. 
The solution should be bright pink. Pour the gelatin mixture into shallow pan
