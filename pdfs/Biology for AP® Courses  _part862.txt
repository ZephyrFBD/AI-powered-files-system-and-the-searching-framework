nity for its substrate, with the effect of increasing or decreasing the
rate of the reaction. The attachment signals to the enzyme. This binding can increase or decrease the enzymeâ€™s activity,
providing feedback. This feedback type of control is effective as long as the chemical affecting it is attached to the enzyme.
Once the overall concentration of the chemical decreases, it will diffuse away from the protein, and the control is relaxed.
Control of Catabolic Pathways
Enzymes, proteins, electron carriers, and pumps that play roles in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport
chain tend to catalyze non-reversible reactions. In other words, if the initial reaction takes place, the pathway is committed
to proceeding with the remaining reactions. Whether a particular enzyme activity is released depends upon the energy needs
of the cell (as reflected by the levels of ATP, ADP, and AMP).
Glycolysis
The control of glycolysis begins with the first enzyme in the pathway, h
