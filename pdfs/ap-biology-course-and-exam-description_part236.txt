predator/prey interactions, trophic cascades, 
and niche partitioning.
 
ENE-4.B.4
Competition, predation, and symbioses, 
including parasitism, mutualism, and 
commensalism, can drive population dynamics.
ENE-4.C
Explain how community 
structure is related to 
energy availability in 
the environment.
