hanges. The hypothalamus acts as an endocrine organ, synthesizing hormones and transporting
them along axons to the posterior pituitary gland. It synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine
cells in the anterior pituitary gland. The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal
medulla via neuronal control.
The pituitary gland, sometimes called the hypophysis or “master gland” is located at the base of the brain in the sella
turcica, a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull, illustrated in Figure 28.15. It is attached to the hypothalamus via a
stalk called the pituitary stalk (or infundibulum). The anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or
release-inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory
cells to release hormones produced by the hypothalamus. The pituitary has two distinct regions—the anterior pituitary and
the posterior
