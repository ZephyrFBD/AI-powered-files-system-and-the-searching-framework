. For example, magnesium metal reacts with hydrochloric acid to form magne-
sium chloride and hydrogen gas (Figure 4.13):

The oxidation number of Mg changes from 0 to +2, an increase that indicates the atom 
has lost electrons and has therefore been oxidized. The oxidation number of H+ in the acid 
decreases from +1 to 0, indicating that this ion has gained electrons and has therefore

How many moles of hydrogen gas would be produced for every mole 
of magnesium added into the HCl solution?
