•  Safety goggles, calculator, microscope, microscope slides, clear cellophane tape, clear 
nail polish, scissors 
•  Graph paper and metric ruler as needed to determine leaf surface area 
•  Potometer, which students assemble from clear plastic tubing, a ring stand with 
clamp, and a 0.1-mL or 1.0-mL pipette, depending on the diameter of the stem (It 
is recommended that you have available clear plastic tubing of different sizes to 
accommodate stems from different plants.) A syringe without needle can be used for 
filling the tubing with water, or the tubing can be filled using a water bottle. Students 
should be able to make the observations that air bubbles in the tubing could interfere 
with transpiration and that when assembling the potometer, as shown in Figure 2, the 
end of the stem must be immersed in the water. If students are using a gas pressure 
sensor, the tubing is inserted directly i
