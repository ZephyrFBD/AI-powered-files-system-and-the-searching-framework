Upon the bridge call'd Ponte<107> Angelo Erected is a castle passing

cannons, forg'd of brass, Do match<108> the number of the days contain'd

MEPHIST. Nay, stay, my Faustus:  I know you'd see the Pope, And
take some part of holy Peter's feast, The which, in state and<110> high

THE TRAGICAL HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS BY CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE
FROM THE QUARTO OF 1616.
