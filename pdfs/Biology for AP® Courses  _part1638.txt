scription initiation phase ends with the production of abortive transcripts, which are polymers of approximately 10
nucleotides that are made and released.
Figure 15.7 The σ subunit of prokaryotic RNA polymerase recognizes consensus sequences found in the promoter
region upstream of the transcription start sight. The σ subunit dissociates from the polymerase after transcription has
been initiated.

Mutations can occur in any part of the DNA. What can happen if there is a mutation in the promoter sequence?
a.
All processes will carry on as usual. Nothing will be affected.
b.
RNA polymerase will not be able to attach.
c.
RNA polymerase will bind upstream of the promoter sequence.
d.
RNA polymerase will bind downstream of the promoter sequence.
