peroxide. Make a sketch of 3Br -1aq24 versus time from 
the addition of the solid to the end of the reaction.
 14.78 In solution, chemical species as simple as H+ and OH -  
can serve as catalysts for reactions. Imagine you could 
measure the 3H+4 of a solution containing an acid- 
catalyzed reaction as it occurs. Assume the reactants and 
products themselves are neither acids nor bases. Sketch 
the 3H+4 concentration profile you would measure as a 
function of time for the reaction, assuming t = 0 is when 
you add a drop of acid to the reaction.
 14.79 The oxidation of SO2 to SO3 is accelerated by NO2. The re-
action proceeds according to:
NO21g2 + SO21g2 ยก  NO1g2 + SO31g2
2 NO1g2 + O21g2 ยก 2 NO21g2
 
 (a) Show that, with appropriate coefficients, the two reac-
tions can be summed to give the overall oxidation of SO2 
by O2 to give SO3. (b) Do we consider NO2 a catalyst or an 
intermediate in this rea
