The heart is a complex muscle that pumps blood through the three divisions of the circulatory system: the coronary (vessels
that serve the heart), pulmonary (heart and lungs), and systemic (systems of the body), as shown in Figure 31.10. Coronary
circulation intrinsic to the heart takes blood directly from the main artery (aorta) coming from the heart. For pulmonary and
systemic circulation, the heart has to pump blood to the lungs or the rest of the body, respectively. In vertebrates, the lungs
are relatively close to the heart in the thoracic cavity. The shorter distance to pump means that the muscle wall on the ri
