ubstitutions at other positions in the sodium 
channel protein. They exposed the mosquito strains to nonpyrethroid insecticides. 
Predict the susceptibility of the mosquitoes to the insecticides. The scientists 
claim that the mosquito population of region B evolved resistance over the 
period of the experiment and that resistance arose as a result of the immigration 
of resistant mosquitoes from other regions. Based on the data in Table 1 and the 
information provided, provide evidence to support the scientistsâ€™ claim.
Analyze Model or Visual Representation (Question 5 on AP Exam)
In humans, the gene that determines a particular condition has only two alleles,
