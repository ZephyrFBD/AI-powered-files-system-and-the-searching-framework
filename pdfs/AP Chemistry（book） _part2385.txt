us reactants.) The tempera-
ture is 273 + 300 = 573 K. The value for the ideal-gas constant, R, 
is 0.08206 L@atm>mol@K. Using Kc = 9.60, we therefore have
Kp = Kc 1RT2∆n = 19.60210.08206 * 5732-2
=
19.602
10.08206 * 57322 = 4.34 * 10-3
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
For which of the following reactions is the ratio Kp>Kc largest 
at 300 K?
(a) N21g2 + O21g2 ∆ 2 NO1g2
(b) CaCO31s2 ∆ CaO1s2 + CO21g2
(c) Ni1CO241g2 ∆ Ni1s2 + 4 CO1g2
(d) C1s2 + 2 H21g2 ∆ CH41g2
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
For the equilibrium 2 SO31g2 ∆ 2 SO21g2 + O21g2,
Kc is 4.08 * 10-3 at 1000 K. Calculate the value for Kp.
Equilibrium Constants and Units
You may wonder why equilibrium constants are reported without units. The equilib-
rium constant is related to the kinetics of a reaction as well as to the thermodynamics. 
(We explore this latter connection in Chapter 19.) Equilibrium constants derived from
