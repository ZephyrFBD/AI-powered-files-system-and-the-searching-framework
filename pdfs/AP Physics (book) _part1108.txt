10–2 Density and Specific Gravity
1. (I) The approximate volume of the granite monolith known
as El Capitan in Yosemite National Park (Fig.10–47) is about
What is its approximate mass?
108 m3.
4. (I) State your mass and then estimate your volume. [Hint:
Because you can swim on or just under the surface of the
water in a swimming pool, you have a pretty good idea of
your density.]
5. (II) A bottle has a mass of 35.00 g when empty and 98.44 g
when filled with water. When filled with another fluid, the
mass is 89.22 g. What is the specific gravity of this other fluid?
6. (II) If 4.0 L of antifreeze solution
is added to 5.0 L of water to make a 9.0-L mixture, what is
the specific gravity of the mixture?
7. (III) The Earth is not a uniform sphere, but has regions of
varying density. Consider a simple model of the Earth
divided into three regions—inner core, outer core, and man-
tle. Each region is taken to have a unique constant density
(the average density of that region in t
