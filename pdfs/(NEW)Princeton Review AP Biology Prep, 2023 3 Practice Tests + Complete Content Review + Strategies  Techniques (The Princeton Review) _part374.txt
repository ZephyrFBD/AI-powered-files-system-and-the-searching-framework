10. Griffith was a researcher who coined the term transformation when he noticed that incubating nonpathogenic
bacteria with heat-killed pathogenic bacteria produced bacteria that ultimately became pathogenic, or deadly,
in mice. What caused the transformation in his experiment?
(A) DNA from the nonpathogenic bacteria revitalized the heat-killed pathogenic bacteria.
(B) Protein from the pathogenic bacteria was taken up by the nonpathogenic bacteria.
(C) DNA from the pathogenic bacteria was taken up by the nonpathogenic bacteria.
(D) DNA in the nonpathogenic bacteria turned into pathogenic genes in the absence of pathogenic bacteria.
11. A biologist systematically removes each of the proteins involved in DNA replication to determine the effect
each has on the process. In one experiment, after separating the strands of DNA, she sees many short
DNA/RNA fragments as well as some long DNA pieces. Which of the following is most likely missing?
(A) Heli
