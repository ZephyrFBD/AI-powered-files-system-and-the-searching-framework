Cleavage is the rapid mitotic cell division of the zygote that occurs
immediately after fertilization. In general, cleavage produces a fluid-filled
ball of cells called a blastula. In mammals, the embryo at this stage is
called a blastocyst. Clustered at one end of the blastocoel cavity is a
group of cells called the inner cell mass that will develop into the
embryo. The cells of the very early blastocoel stage are pluripotent and
are the source of embryonic stem cell lines. The cells that surround the
inner cell mass are the trophoblast. They secrete fluid, creating the
blastocoel, and also form structures that will attach the embryo to the
mother’s uterus. See Figure 18.7.

Differentiation results from silencing specific genes.

During the next stage of development, the cells of the blastocyst or
blastula communicate with each other and begin to differentiate. In many
animals, the movement
