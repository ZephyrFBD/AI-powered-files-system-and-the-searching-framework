A in their nuclei. The reason
why they are so different in their structures and functions is
because each cell expresses different genes and makes different
proteins. The same stretch of DNA can produce different
proteins by expressing a different combination of exons. Some
genes can be suppressed or deactivated entirely or
underexpressed (called “downregulated”). Some genes can be
upregulated and can produce more of certain proteins than
others. Also, genes can be turned on and off at different times
in the life of a cell. All of these facts contribute to one person
having many different types of body cells, each with the same
DNA.
