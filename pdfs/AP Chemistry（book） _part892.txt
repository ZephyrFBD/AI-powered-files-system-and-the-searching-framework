ure 6.7). Light 
shining on a clean metal surface causes electrons to be emitted from the surface. 
A minimum frequency of light, different for different metals, is required for the 
 
emission of electrons. For example, light with a frequency of 4.60 * 1014 s - 1 or 
greater causes cesium metal to emit electrons, but if the light has frequency less than 
that, no electrons are emitted.
To explain the photoelectric effect, Einstein assumed that the radiant energy strik-
ing the metal surface behaves like a stream of tiny energy packets. Each packet, which is 
like a “particle” of energy, is called a photon. Extending Planck’s quantum theory, Ein-
stein deduced that each photon must have an energy equal to the Planck constant times 
the frequency of the light:
 
Energy of photon = E = hn 
[6.3]
Thus, radiant energy itself is quantized.
Under the right conditions, photons striking a metal surface can transfer their 
energy to electrons in the metal. A certain amount of energy—called the
