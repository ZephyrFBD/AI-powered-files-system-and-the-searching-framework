o solve this type of problem is to treat each gene separately and then combine the
probabilities. The probability that the cross AA × Aa would produce Aa is . Similarly, the probability that the
cross Bb × Bb would produce Bb is also . The probability that the cross Cc × CC would produce Cc is also .
Therefore, the probability of all three events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: 
. Choices (A), (C), and (D) do not list the correct probability.
45. (A) The trait occurs in every generation and affects both males and females, so it is most likely an autosomal
dominant trait. Sex-linked dominant traits would be passed on to every offspring of a female who has the trait.
That’s not what’s shown here, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (C) is incorrect because sex-linked recessive
traits are more often expressed in males than females because males have only one X chromosome.
Mitochondrial inheritance occurs from mother to offspring; males do not pass on mitochondri
