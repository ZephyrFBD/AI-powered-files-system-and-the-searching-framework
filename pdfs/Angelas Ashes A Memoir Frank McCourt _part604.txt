s, 
 
 the way you always did. He stands before her with his suitcase. She gets 
 
 up, takes down the box of chocolates and hands them around. She puts 
 
 a chocolate in her mouth and takes it out again because it’s too hard and 
 
 she can’t chew it. I have a soft one and I offer it for the hard one, which 
 
 will last longer. It’s creamy and rich and there’s a nut in the middle. 
 
 Malachy and Michael complain they didn’t get a nut and why is it Frank 
 
 always gets the nut? Mam says,What do you mean, always? This is the 
 
 first time we ever had a box of chocolates. 
 
 Malachy says, He got the raisin in the bun at school and all the boys 
 
 said he gave it to Paddy Clohessy, so why couldn’t he give us the nut? 
 
 Mam says, Because ’tis Christmas and he has sore eyes and the nut 
 
 is good for the sore eyes. 
 
 Michael says,Will the nut make his eyes better? 
 
 ’Twill. 
 
 Will it make one eye better or will it make two eyes better? 
 
 The two eyes, I think.
