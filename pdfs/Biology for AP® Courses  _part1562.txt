another type of repair, nucleotide excision repair, the incorrect base is removed along with a few bases on the 5' and 3' end,
and these are replaced by copying the template with the help of DNA polymerase. The ends of the newly synthesized
fragment are attached to the rest of the DNA using DNA ligase, which creates a phosphodiester bond.
Most mistakes are corrected, and if they are not, they may result in a mutation defined as a permanent change in the DNA
sequence. Mutations can be of many types, such as substitution, deletion, insertion, and translocation. Mutations can be
induced or may occur spontaneously.
