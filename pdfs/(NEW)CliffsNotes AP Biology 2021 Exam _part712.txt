, water pollution, and land pollution contaminate the materials essential to life. Many
pollutants do not readily degrade and remain in the environment for decades. Some toxins, such as the pesticide
DDT, concentrate in plants and animals. As one organism eats another, the toxin becomes more and more
concentrated, a process called biological magnification. Other pollution occurs in subtle ways. A lake, for example,
can be polluted with runoff fertilizer or sewage. Abundant nutrients, especially phosphates, stimulate algal blooms,
or massive growths of algae and other phytoplankton. The phytoplankton reduce oxygen supplies at night when they
respire. In addition, when the algae eventually die, their bodies are consumed by detritivorous bacteria, whose
growth further depletes the oxygen. The result is massive oxygen starvation for many animals, including fish and
invertebrates. In the end, the lake fills with carcasses of dead animals and plants. The process of nutrient enrichment
