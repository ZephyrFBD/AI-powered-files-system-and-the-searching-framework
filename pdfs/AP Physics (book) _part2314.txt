top and
bottom sections of the square coil of Fig. 21–9 are in opposite directions and
cancel each other. The magnetic force 
exerted on the left vertical section of
the square coil acts to the left as shown because the current is up (clockwise).
The right side of the loop is in the region where 
Hence the external
force to the right,
needed to just overcome the magnetic force to the left 
(on 
), is
which is the same answer, confirming our use of energy conservation above.
