yme Analysis 
of DNA,  a revision of Laboratory 6B (Molecular Biology: Restriction Enzyme 
Cleavage of DNA and Electrophoresis) in the 2001 AP Biology Lab Manual, opens with 
two questions: Is that blood? and Are you sure that the hamburger you recently ate in the 
local fast-food restaurant was actually pure beef? Applications of DNA profiling extend 
T120  Introducing Investigations 7–9
beyond what we see on television crime shows; and in addition to confirming that often 
hamburger meat is a mixture of pork and other nonbeef products, DNA technology can 
be used to determine paternity and diagnose an inherited illness. To answer the question 
Whose blood is spattered on the floor? in the investigation’s crime scene scenario, students 
use restriction endonucleases and gel electrophoresis to create and analyze genetic 
“fingerprints.” By learning the fundamental skills involved in creating genetic profiles 
using gel electrophoresis, students acquire the tools to conduct more sophist
