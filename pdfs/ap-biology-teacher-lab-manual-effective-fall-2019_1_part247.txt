 entire human genome to try to locate the same 
sequence of bases as that in fruit flies. This definitely isnâ€™t practical, so a sophisticated 
technological method is required.
Bioinformatics is a field that combines statistics, mathematical modeling, and 
computer science to analyze biological data. Using bioinformatics methods, entire 
genomes can be quickly compared in order to detect genetic similarities and differences. 
An extremely powerful bioinformatics tool is BLAST, which stands for Basic Local 
Alignment Search Tool. Using BLAST, you can input a gene sequence of interest and 
search entire genomic libraries for identical or similar sequences in a matter of seconds.
In this laboratory investigation, students will use BLAST to compare several genes, 
and then use the information to construct a cladogram. A cladogram (also called a 
phylogenetic tree) is a visualization of the evolutionary relatedness of species. Figure 1 is 
a simple cladogram.
