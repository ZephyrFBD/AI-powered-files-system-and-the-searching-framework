At 500 K, the reaction 2 NO1g2 + Cl21g2 ∆ 2 NOCl1g2 has 
Kp = 51. In an equilibrium mixture at 500 K, the partial pres-
sure of NO is 0.125 atm and Cl2 is 0.165 atm. What is the par-
tial pressure of NOCl in the equilibrium mixture? (a) 0.13 atm 
(b) 0.36 atm (c) 1.0 atm (d) 5.1 * 10-5 atm (e) 0.125 atm
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
At 500 K, the reaction PCl51g2 ∆ PCl31g2 + Cl21g2 has 
Kp = 0.497. In an equilibrium mixture at 500 K, the partial 
pressure of PCl5 is 0.860 atm and that of PCl3 is 0.350 atm. 
What is the partial pressure of Cl2 in the equilibrium mixture?
In many situations, we know the value of the equilibrium constant and the ini-
tial amounts of all species. We must then solve for the equilibrium amounts. Solv-
ing this type of problem usually entails treating the change in concentration as a 
variable. The stoichiometry of the reaction gives us the relationship between the 
changes in the amounts of all the reactants and produc
