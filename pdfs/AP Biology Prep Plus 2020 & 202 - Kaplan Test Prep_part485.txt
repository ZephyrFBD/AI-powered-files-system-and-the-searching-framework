TEST WHAT YOU LEARNED
The first generation oﬀspring should all have the genotype Ry (because
they receive an R allele from the homozygous red parent and a y allele
from the homozygous yellow parent). Thus, when a Ry (red) apple tree
is crossed with a yy (yellow) apple tree, half of the oﬀspring should be
Ry (red) and the other half should be yy (yellow). Out of 10 oﬀspring, 5
would be red and 5 yellow. This eliminates (A) and (B). To determine
whether this is statistically significant, calculate chi-square as follows:
phenotype

χ2 = 0.4
Because 0.4 is less than 3.84, the threshold for p = 0.05 with 1 degree of
freedom, the result is not statistically significant, making (C) correct.
(D) is incorrect because it misrepresents the chi-square value.
