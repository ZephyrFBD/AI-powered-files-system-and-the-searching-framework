During digestion, four different groups of molecules are commonly encountered. Each is broken down into its
molecular components by specific enzymes, as follows:
1. Starches are broken down into glucose molecules.
2. Proteins are broken down into amino acids.
3. Fats (or lipids) are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids.
4. Nucleic acids are broken down into nucleotides.
In humans and other mammals, digestion follows the following sequence of events. In particular, note which kinds
of molecules are digested (broken down) and by which enzymes. Since enzymes are specific for different bonds,
only a representative few of the numerous enzymes are given:
1. Mouth. Salivary amylase, secreted into the mouth by the salivary glands, begins the breakdown of starch into
maltose (a disaccharide). Chewing reduces the size of food particles, thereby increasing the surface area upon which
amylase and subsequent enzymes can operate. Food is shaped into a ball, or bolus, and then sw
