s energy and
is less complex than uric acid formation.
40. In terms of evolution, why might the urea cycle have
evolved in organisms?
a.
so organisms could adapt to the changing
environment when terrestrial life forms evolved
b.
so organisms could evolve the ability to switch
between direct ammonia excretion and urea
c.
so organisms could reduce their excretion of
ammonia in the form of urea
d.
so organisms could adapt to the changing
environment and excrete higher concentrations
of uric acid
41. How do hormones regulate blood pressure, blood
volume, and kidney function?
a.
Different regions of the liver have specialized
cells that respond to chemical messengers and
hormones like epinephrine, renin, aldosterone,
ADH, and ANP. These regulate the needs of the
body and communication between different
organ systems.
b.
Different regions of the nephrons have
specialized cells that respond to chemical
messengers and hormones like epinephrine,
renin, aldosterone, ADH, and ANP. These
regulate
