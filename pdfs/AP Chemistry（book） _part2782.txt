treated before piping it to Flint. The source of the 
lead was not the Flint River itself, but corrosion from lead pipes that 
are present in the underground water distribution network. Why did 
the change in water supply dramatically increase the leaching of lead 
from the old pipes? Many factors were at play, but basically they all 
came down to solubility considerations.
When water is properly treated, a passivation layer of insoluble 
lead salts builds up on the inner surface of the lead pipes (Figure 17.21). 
This layer prevents corrosion that would otherwise allow lead to be 
oxidized and dissolve into the water as Pb2+ ions. The water treatment 
facility in Detroit was adding phosphate ions, PO4
3 - , to their water to 
inhibit corrosion, whereas the people managing water treatment in 
Flint elected not to do so. The presence of PO4
3 -  ions promotes the 
formation of highly insoluble phosphate salts on the inner surface of 
the pipes that helps prevent corrosion.
