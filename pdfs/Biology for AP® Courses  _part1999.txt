tic. The gene for resistance was already present in the gene pool of the
bacteria, likely at a low frequency. The antibiotic, which kills the bacterial cells without the resistance gene, strongly selects
individuals that are resistant, since these would be the only ones that survived and divided. Experiments have demonstrated
that mutations for antibiotic resistance do not arise as a result of antibiotic.
In a larger sense, evolution is not goal directed. Species do not become “better” over time; they simply track their changing
environment with adaptations that maximize their reproduction in a particular environment at a particular time. Evolution
has no goal of making faster, bigger, more complex, or even smarter species, despite the commonness of this kind of
language in popular discourse. What characteristics evolve in a species are a function of the variation present and the
environment, both of which are constantly changing in a non-directional way. What trait is fit in one envir
