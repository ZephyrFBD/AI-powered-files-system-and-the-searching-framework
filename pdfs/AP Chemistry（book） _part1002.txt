. The 
magnetic quantum number, ml, relates to the orientation of the orbital 
in space. For a given value of l, ml can have integral values ranging 
from -l to l, including 0. Subscripts can be used to label the orienta-
tions of the orbitals. For example, the three 3p orbitals are designated 
3px, 3py, and 3pz, with the subscripts indicating the axis along which 
the orbital is oriented.
An electron shell is the set of all orbitals with the same value 
of n, such as 3s, 3p, and 3d. In the hydrogen atom all the orbitals in 
an electron shell have the same energy. A subshell is the set of one or 
more orbitals with the same n and l values; for example, 3s, 3p, and 
3d are each subshells of the n = 3 shell. There is one orbital in an s 
subshell, three in a p subshell, five in a d subshell, and seven in an f 
subshell.
REPRESENTATIONS OF ORBITALS (SECTION 6.6) Contour repre-
sentations are useful for visualizing the shapes of the orbitals. Rep-
