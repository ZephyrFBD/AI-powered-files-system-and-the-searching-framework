athematical equations from quantum mechanics known as
wave functions can predict within a certain level of probability where an electron might be at any given time. The area
where an electron is most likely to be found is called its orbital.
Recall that the Bohr model depicts an atomâ€™s electron shell configuration. Within each electron shell are subshells, and
each subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons. While it is impossible to calculate exactly where an
electron is located, scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path. Subshells are designated by the
letter s, p, d, and f. The s subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital. Principal shell 1n has only a single s orbital,
which can hold two electrons. Principal shell 2n has one s and one p subshell, and can hold a total of eight electrons. The
p subshell has three dumbbell-shaped orbitals, as illustrated in Figure 2.8. Subshells d and f have more complex shapes
and contain f
