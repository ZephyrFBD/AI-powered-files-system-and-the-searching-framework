in the periodic table: We see that the number of elements in 
the rows of the periodic table—2, 8, 18, and 32—equals twice 
these numbers. We will discuss this relationship further in 
Section 6.9.
Figure 6.18 shows the relative energies of the hydrogen atom 
orbitals through n = 3. Each box represents an orbital, and orbit-
als of the same subshell, such as the three 2p orbitals, are grouped 
 
together. When the electron occupies the lowest-energy orbital 
(1s), the hydrogen atom is said to be in its ground state. When the 
electron occupies any other orbital, the atom is in an excited state. 
(The electron can be excited to a higher-energy orbital by absorp-
tion of a photon of appropriate energy.) At ordinary temperatures, 
essentially all hydrogen atoms are in the ground state.
