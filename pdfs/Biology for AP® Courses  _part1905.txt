between chains whereas deep
sequencing is suitable when there is one or more than one nucleotide different between chains.
d.
Sanger sequencing reads and sequences a genome multiple times whereas deep sequencing accurately
sequences the whole genome in a single time.
Uses of Genome Sequences
DNA microarrays are methods used to detect gene expression by analyzing an array of DNA fragments that are fixed to a
glass slide or a silicon chip to identify active genes and identify sequences. Almost one million genotypic abnormalities can
be discovered using microarrays, whereas whole-genome sequencing can provide information about all six billion base pairs
in the human genome. Although the study of medical applications of genome sequencing is interesting, this discipline tends
to dwell on abnormal gene function. Knowledge of the entire genome will allow future onset diseases and other genetic
disorders to be discovered early, which will allow for more informed decisions to be made about life
