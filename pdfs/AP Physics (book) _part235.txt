We now consider the
motion of objects that move in paths in two (or three) dimensions. In par-
ticular, we discuss an important type of motion known as projectile motion:

of motion in two dimensions, we will need a new tool,vectors, and how to add them.

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
[Don’t worry about getting the right answer now—you will get another chance later in the
Chapter. See also p. 1 of Chapter 1 for more explanation.]
A small heavy box of emergency supplies is dropped from a moving helicopter at
point A as it flies at constant speed in a horizontal direction. Which path in the
drawing below best describes the path of the box (neglecting air resistance) as
seen by a person standing on the ground?
