Converging lenses are thicker at the center whereas diverging lenses are thicker at the edges.

FIGURE 23–33 Parallel rays are
brought to a focus by a converging
thin lens.
Consider parallel rays striking the double convex lens shown in cross section in
Fig. 23–33. We assume the lens is made of transparent material such as glass or
transparent plastic with index of refraction greater than that of the air outside. The
axis of a lens is a straight line passing through the center of the lens and perpen-
dicular to its two surfaces (Fig.23–33). From Snell’s law, we can see that each ray in
Fig. 23–33 is bent toward the axis when the ray enters the lens and again when it
leaves the lens at the back surface. (Note the dashed lines indicating the normals to
each surface for the top ray.) If rays pa
