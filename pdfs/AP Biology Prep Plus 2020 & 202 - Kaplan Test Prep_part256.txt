oaded into the phloem, the water potential, or the
amount of water pressure, in the phloem is eï¬€ectively reduced. The influx
of sugar into the phloem creates an osmotic potential that pulls more
water into the phloem, generating a water pressure that forces sap
(essentially sugar-rich water) down the phloem toward the roots. The
xylem will recycle this water back from the roots.
Water Gain and Loss in Plants
As you can see in the following figure, vascular cambium (C) divides
laterally to create new phloem (P) on the outer edges of the tree and new
xylem (X) near the inner core. This results in the formation of annual tree
rings.
Plant Nutrients
Plants require certain nutrients and compounds that are important for
normal physiological functions. For example, the photoreceptor
phytochrome is an important pigment that plants use to detect light.
Internal Anatomy of a Plant
Plants can use phytochrome to regulate flowering based on day length or
to set up other daily rhythms. Large amounts
