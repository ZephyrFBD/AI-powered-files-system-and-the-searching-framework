es and the “sneaking” males will be selected for, but medium-sized males, which can’t overtake the alpha males and
are too big to sneak copulations, are selected against. Diversifying selection can also occur when environmental changes
favor individuals on either end of the phenotypic spectrum. Imagine a population of mice living at the beach where there
is light-colored sand interspersed with patches of tall grass. In this scenario, light-colored mice that blend in with the sand
would be favored, as well as dark-colored mice that can hide in the grass. Medium-colored mice, on the other hand, would
not blend in with either the grass or the sand, and would thus be more likely to be eaten by predators. The result of this type
of selection is increased genetic variance as the population becomes more diverse.
