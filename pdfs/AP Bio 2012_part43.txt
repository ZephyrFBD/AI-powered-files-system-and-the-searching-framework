35. Living cells typically have biosynthetic pathways 
to synthesize at least some of the amino acids 
used in making proteins. Some strains of E. coli,  
a prokaryote, can synthesize the amino acid 
tryptophan, while other E. coli strains cannot. 
Similarly, some strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae, 
a eukaryote, can synthesize tryptophan, while 
other S. cerevisiae strains cannot. 
  Which of the following describes the most likely 
source of genetic variation found in the 
tryptophan synthesis pathways
