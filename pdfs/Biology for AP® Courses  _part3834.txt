| Hormonal Control of Osmoregulatory Functions
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
How do hormonal cures help the kidneys synchronize the osmotic needs of the body?
•
How do hormones and other chemical messengers including epinephrine, norepinephrine, rennin-angiotensin,
aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone, and atrial natriuretic peptide help regulate waste elimination, maintain correct
osmolarity, and perform other osmoregulatory functions?
Connection for AP® Courses
As we learned in an earlier section, the excretory system works with the circulatory and endocrine systems to maintain
osmotic balance, eliminate wastes, and maintain blood pressure. For AP®, you do not need to memorize the list of hormones
that control osmoregulatory functions or their specific function(s). However, information in this section applies to concepts
previously explored.
The kidneys synchronize with hormonal cues. As you recall from our study of the endocrine system, hormones are small
