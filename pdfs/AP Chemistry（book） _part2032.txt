CHAPTER 13 Properties of Solutions
Solution Formation and Chemical Reactions
In discussing solutions, we must be careful to distinguish the physical process of solution 
formation from chemical reactions that lead to a solution. For example, nickel metal dis-
solves on contact with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution because the following reac-
tion occurs:
 
Ni1s2 + 2 HCl1aq2 ¡ NiCl21aq2 + H21g2 
[13.2]
In this instance, one of the resulting solutes is not Ni metal but rather its salt NiCl2. 
If the solution is evaporated to dryness, NiCl2 # 6 H2O1s2 is recovered (Figure 13.6). Com-
pounds such as NiCl2 # 6 H2O1s2 that h
