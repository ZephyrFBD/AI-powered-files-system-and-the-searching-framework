ble 32â€“5) are the leptons, the quarks, the gauge bosons (photon, W and Z, and
the gluons), and the Higgs boson. The photon, leptons,
and 
have all
been observed in experiments. But only combinations of quarks (baryons and
mesons) have been observed in the free state, and it seems likely that free quarks
and gluons cannot be observed in isolation.
One important aspect of theoretical work is the attempt to find a unified
basis for the different forces in nature. This was a long-held hope of Einstein,
which he was never able to fulfill. A so-called gauge theory that unifies the weak
and electromagnetic interactions was put forward in the 1960s by S. Weinberg,
S. Glashow, and A. Salam. In this electroweak theory, the weak and electro-
magnetic forces are seen as two different manifestations of a single, more
fundamental, electroweak interaction. The electroweak theory has had many
successes, including the prediction of the 
particles as carriers of the weak
force, with masses of
