roidism).
Antibodies produced by the immune system mistakenly bind to TSH receptors on the thyroid gland, stimulating the
thyroid gland to produce thyroxin. As a result, thyroxin production continues even in the absence of TSH.
Hyperthyroidism causes high metabolic activity, which manifests as hyperactivity, excessive sweating, weight loss,
insomnia, and other problems.
4. Human growth hormone (HGH) is secreted by the anterior pituitary.
It stimulates the liver to secrete growth factors into the blood which stimulate bone and cartilage development. An
excess of HGH secreted during childhood can result in gigantism, while an underproduction can result in dwarfism.
Thermoregulation
Animals can be loosely grouped into two groups based upon how body temperature is maintained:
1. Ectotherms are animals that obtain body heat from their environment so their temperatures often vary with the
temperature of their environment. Examples include most invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, and fish. B
