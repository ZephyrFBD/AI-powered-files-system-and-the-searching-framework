4.7 The labels have fallen off three bottles containing powdered 
samples of metals; one contains zinc, one lead, and the other 
platinum. You have three solutions at your disposal: 1 M so-
dium nitrate, 1 M nitric acid, and 1 M nickel nitrate. How 
could you use these solutions to determine the identities of 
each metal powder? [Section 4.4]
 
4.8 Explain how a redox reaction involves electrons in the same 
way that a neutralization reaction involves protons. [Sec-
tions 4.3 and 4.4]
