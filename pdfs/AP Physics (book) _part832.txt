NEWTON’S SECOND LAW

I depends on axis of rotation 
and on distribution of mass
For most ordinary objects, the mass is distributed continuously, and the calcu-
lation of the moment of inertia,
can be difficult. Expressions can, however,
be worked out (using calculus) for the moments of inertia of regularly shaped
objects in terms of the dimensions of the objects. Figure 8–20 gives these expres-
sions for a number of solids rotated about the axes specified. The only one for
which the result is obvious is that for the thin hoop or ring rotated about an axis
passing through its center perpendicular to the plane of the hoop (Fig. 8–20a). For
a hoop, all the mass is concentrated at the same distance from the axis, R. Thus
where M is the total mass of the hoop. In Fig. 8–20, we
use capital R to refer to the outer radius of an object (in (d) also
