point out, it is likely that the negative effects of increasing carrying capacity will outweigh the positive ones—the carrying
capacity of the world for human beings might actually decrease.
The world’s human population is currently experiencing exponential growth even though human reproduction is far below
its biotic potential (Figure 36.15). To reach its biotic potential, all females would have to become pregnant every nine
months or so during their reproductive years. Also, resources would have to be such that the environment would support
such growth. Neither of these two conditions exists. In spite of this fact, human population is still growing exponentially.
Figure 36.15 Human population growth since 1000 AD is exponential (dark blue line). Notice that while the population
in Asia (yellow line), which has many economically underdeveloped countries, is increasing exponentially, the
population in Europe (light blue line), where most of the countries are economically developed, i
