r at the
top of the stomach keeps food in the stomach from backing up into the
esophagus and burning it. The pyloric sphincter at the bottom of the
stomach keeps the food in the stomach long enough to be digested.
Excessive acid can cause an ulcer to form in the esophagus, the
stomach, or the duodenum (the first 12 inches [30 cm] of the small
intestine). However, scientists now know that a common cause of ulcers is
a particular bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, which can be effectively
treated with antibiotics.
Small Intestine
Digestion is completed in the duodenum. Intestinal enzymes and
pancreatic amylases hydrolyze starch and glycogen into maltose. Bile,
which is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, is released
into the small intestine as needed and acts as an emulsifier to break down
fats, creating greater surface area for digestive enzymes. Peptidases, such
as trypsin and chymotrypsin, continue to break down proteins. Nucleic
acids are hydrolyzed by nucleases, and li
