e Regulation
In this section, you will explore the following question:
•
What is the role of transcription factors, enhancers, and repressors in gene regulation?
Connection for AP® Courses
To start transcription, general transcription factors must first bind to a specific area on the DNA called the TATA box and
then recruit RNA polymerase to that location. In addition, other areas on the DNA called enhancer regions help augment
transcription. Transcription factors can bind to enhancer regions to increase or prevent transcription.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A Learning Objective merges required content with one or more of the seven Science Practices
