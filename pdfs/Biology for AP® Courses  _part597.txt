b.
Excess potassium increases action potential generation, leading to uncoordinated organ activity.
c.
Potassium dissipates the electrochemical gradient in cardiac muscle cells, preventing them from contracting.
d.
Potassium creates a new concentration gradient across the cell membrane, preventing sodium from leaving
the cell.

What are the differences among the different types of endocytosis: (phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-
mediated endocytosis) and exocytosis?
Connection for AP® Courses
Diffusion, osmosis, and active transport are used to transport fairly small molecules across plasma cell membranes.
However, sometimes large particles, such as macromolecules, parts of cells, or even unicellular microorganisms, can be
engulfed by other cells in a process called phagocytosis or “cell eating.” In this form of endocytosis, the cell membrane
surrounds the particle, pinches off, and brings the particle into
