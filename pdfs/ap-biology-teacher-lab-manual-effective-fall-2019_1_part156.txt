In this case, the deviation from expected may be due to random chance, or it may 
be due to a phenomenon known as linkage, where two genes are located close together 
on the same chromosome instead of on separate chromosomes. There is not enough 
space here to fully explore the strategies for solving such a problem, but realize that 
the challenge requires a different level of commitment on your part to work through 
the problem and solve it. Instead of the instructions for each lab investigation walking 
you through such problems step by step, this manual provides you with opportunities 
to explore problems you can solve on your own, which will give you a deeper learning 
experience.
