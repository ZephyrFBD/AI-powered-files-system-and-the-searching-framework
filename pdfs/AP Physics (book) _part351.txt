ard force on the air, but it is the air pushing 
forward (Newton’s third law) on the bird’s wings that propels the bird forward.
What exerts the force to move a car?
What makes a car go forward?
RESPONSE A common answer is that the engine makes the car move for-
ward. But it is not so simple. The engine makes the wheels go around. But if the
tires are on slick ice or wet mud, they just spin. Friction is needed. On firm
ground, the tires push backward against the ground because of friction. By
Newton’s third law, the ground pushes on the tires in the opposite direction,
accelerating the car forward.
We tend to associate forces with active objects such as humans, animals,
engines, or a moving object like a hammer. It is often difficult to see how an 
inanimate object at rest, such as a wall or a desk, or the wall of an ice rink
(Fig. 4–9), can exert a force. The explanation is that every material, no matter
how hard, is elastic (springy) at least to some degree. A stretched rubber band
