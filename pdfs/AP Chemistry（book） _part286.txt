Naturally occurring carbon, for example, is composed of 98.93% 12C and 1.07% 13C. The 
masses of these isotopes are 12 amu (exactly) and 13.00335 amu, respectively, making 
the atomic weight of carbon
10.98932112 amu2 + 10.01072113.00335 amu2 = 12.01 amu

Calculating the Atomic Weight of an Element from Isotopic Abundances
Naturally occurring chlorine is 75.78% 35Cl (atomic mass 34.969 amu) and 24.22% 37Cl (atomic mass 36.966 amu).  
Calculate the atomic weight of chlorine.
