ty allows for the formation of hydrogen bonds between adjacent water molecules, resulting in many unique
properties that are critical to maintaining life. For example, water is an excellent solvent because hydrogen bonds allow ions
and other polar molecules to dissolve in water. Water’s hydrogen bonds also contribute to its high heat capacity and high
heat of vaporization, resulting in greater temperature stability. Hydrogen bond formation makes ice less dense as a solid than
as a liquid, insulating aquatic environments. Water’s cohesive and adhesive properties are seen as it rises inside capillary
tubes or travels up a large tree from roots to leaves. The pH or hydrogen ion concentration of a solution is highly regulated
to help organisms maintain homeostasis; for example, as will be explored in later chapters, the enzymes that catalyze most
chemical reactions in cells are pH specific. Thus, the properties of water are connected to the biochemical and physical
processes performed by l
