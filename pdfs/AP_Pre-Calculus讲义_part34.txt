If the point (a, f (a)) is the highest point on the graph of f within some viewing rectangle, 
then f (a) is a local maximum value of f, and if (b, f (b)) is the lowest point on the graph of f 
within a viewing rectangle, then f (b) is a local minimum value.

We say that such a point (a, f (a)) is a local maximum point on the graph and that (b, f  
(b)) is a local minimum point. 
The local maximum and minimum points on the graph of a function are called its local 
extrema. 
For a polynomial function the number of local extrema must be less than the degree, as 
the following principle indicates. 
If P(x) = anxn + an-1xn-1 + â€¦ + a1x +a0 is a polynomial of degree n, then the graph of P has 
at most n-1 local extrema. 
 
Example 5 
Graph the polynomial and determine how many local extrema it has.
