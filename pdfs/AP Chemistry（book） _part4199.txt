 spontaneous pro-
cess operating at constant temperature, the free energy of the system 
decreases. page 828 It indicates that the process to which the thermo-
dynamic quantity refers has taken place under standard conditions, as 
summarized in Table 19.2. page 831 Above the boiling point, vapori-
zation is spontaneous, and ∆G 6 0. Therefore, ∆H -  T∆S 6  0, and 
∆H 6  T∆S. Therefore T∆S is greater in magnitude. page 834 No. K 
is the ratio of product concentration to reactant concentration at equi-
librium; K could be very small but is not zero.

page 851 Oxygen is first assigned an oxidation number of -2. 
Nitrogen must then have a +3 oxidation number for the sum of oxi-
dation numbers to equal -1, the charge of the ion. page 854  
No. Electrons should appear in the two half-reactions but cancel 
when the half-reactions are added properly. page 861 Yes. A  
redox reaction with a positive standard cell potential is spontaneous  
under standard conditions. page 862 1 atm pres
