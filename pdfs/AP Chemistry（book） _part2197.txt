leave 3NO2
-4 unchanged (experiments 1 and 3), the rate changes by a factor of 4, and 
so forth. These results indicate that the initial reaction rate is proportional to 3NH4
+4. 
When 3NO2
-4 is similarly varied while 3NH4
+4 is held constant, the rate is affected in 
the same manner. Thus, the rate is also directly proportional to the concentration of 
3NO2
-4.
We express the way in which the rate depends on the reactant concentrations by the 
equation
 
Rate = k3NH4
+43NO2
-4 
[14.6]
An equation such as Equation 14.6, which shows how the rate depends on reactant con-
centrations, is called a rate law. For the general reaction
 
a A + b B ยก c C + d D 
the rate law generally has the form
 
Rate = k3A4m3B4n 
[14.7]
Notice that only the concentrations of the reactants generally appear in the rate law. The 
constant k is called the rate constant. The magnitude of k changes with temperature 
and therefore determines how temperature affects rate, as we will see in Section 14.5. The
