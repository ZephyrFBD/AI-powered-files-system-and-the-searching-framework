three-dimensional arrangement has the Cl atoms at the corners of a 
 
tetrahedron, a geometric object with four corners and four faces, each an equilateral triangle.
The shape of a molecule is determined by its bond angles, the angles made by the 
lines joining the nuclei of the atoms in the molecule. The bond angles of a molecule, 
together with the bond lengths 
 (Section 8.8), define the shape and size of the mol-
ecule. In Figure 9.1, you should be able to see that there are six Cl ¬C ¬Cl bond angles 
in CCl4, all of which have the same value. That bond angle, 109.5°, is characteristic of a 
tetrahedron. In addition, all four C ¬Cl bonds are of the same length (1.78 Å). Thus, the 
shape and size of CCl4 are completely described by stating that the molecule is tetrahe-
dral with C ¬Cl bonds of length 1.78 Å. To draw the three-dimensional structure of a 
molecule on paper, chemists use a convention shown in Figure 9.1: Regular lines imply 
the bond is the plane of the paper, a heavy
