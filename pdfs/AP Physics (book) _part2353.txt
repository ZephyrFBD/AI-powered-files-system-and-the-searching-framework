or at the end of bit-line-1 will detect either change in
voltage (increase means it reads a “1”, decrease a “0”). All cells connected to one
word-line are read at the same moment. The capacitor voltage has been altered
by the small charge flow during the reading process. So that cell or bit which has
just been read needs to be written again, or “refreshed.”

the long-term (and slower access) information on hard drives, flash drives, and related devices.
