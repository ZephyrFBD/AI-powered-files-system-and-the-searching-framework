2.9 ▶ Some Simple Organic 
Compounds Become familiar with 
simple families of organic compounds, 
compounds containing carbon and 
hydrogen, and the very basic nomenclature 
of these compounds.

MOLECULES,  
AND IONS 
◀ A FLOWER GARDEN. A staggering diversity of form and function 
can be achieved in plants and animals despite the fact that only a half 
dozen or so elements account for the vast majority of molecules found  
in living organisms.
WhAT’S AheAD 
Although materials vary greatly in their properties, everything is formed 
from only about 100 different kinds of atoms. In a sense, these different atoms 
are like the 26 letters of the English alphabet that join in different combina-
tions to form the immense number of words in our language. But what rules 
govern the ways in which atoms combine? How do the properties of a sub-
stance relate to the kinds of atoms it contains? Indeed, what is an atom like, 
and what m
