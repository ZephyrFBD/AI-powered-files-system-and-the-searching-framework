s. Simply put, energy is
given off during the reaction.
Let’s look at an example. The course of a reaction can be represented by an energy diagram. Here’s an energy
diagram for an exergonic reaction.
You’ll notice that energy is represented along the y-axis. Based on the diagram, we see that our reaction released
energy. An example of an exergonic reaction is the oxidizing of molecules in mitochondria of cells, which then
releases the energy stored in the chemical bonds.
Reactions that require an input of energy are called endergonic reactions. You’ll notice that the products have more
energy than the reactants. An example is plants’ use of carbon dioxide and water to form sugars.
Activation Energy
Even though exergonic reactions release energy, the reaction might not occur naturally without a little bit of energy
to get things going. This is because the reactants must first turn into a high energy molecule, called the transition
state, before turning into the products. The transition
