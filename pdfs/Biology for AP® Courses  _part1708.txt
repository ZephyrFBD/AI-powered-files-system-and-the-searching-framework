 similar, but nucleic
acids are synthesized as a result of translation in
HIV and influenza viruses.
d.
The flow of information is from RNA to protein.
This protein is used to synthesize the DNA of
the viruses in HIV and influenza.

31. Explain the initiation of transcription in prokaryotes.
Include all proteins involved.
a.
In prokaryotes the polymerase is composed of
five polypeptide subunits, two of which are
identical. Four of these subunits, denoted α , α ,
β , and β ’, comprise the polymerase core
enzyme. The fifth subunit, σ , is involved only
in transcription initiation. The polymerase
comprised of all five subunits is called the
holoenzyme.
b.
In prokaryotes the polymerase is composed of
four p
