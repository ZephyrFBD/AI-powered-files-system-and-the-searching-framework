ched, the temperature stops increasing even though heat is still being added.
The ice gradually changes to water in the liquid state, with no change in tempera-
ture. After about 40 kcal has been added at 0°C, half the ice remains and half 
has changed to water. After about 80 kcal, or 330 kJ, has been added, all the ice
has changed to water, still at 0°C. Continued addition of heat causes the water’s
temperature to again increase, now at a rate of 
When 100°C is reached,
the temperature again remains constant as the heat added changes the liquid water
to vapor (steam). About 540 kcal (2260 kJ) is required to change the 1.0 kg of
water completely to steam, after which the graph rises again, indicating that the
temperature of the steam rises as heat is added.
The heat required to change 1.0 kg of a substance from the solid to the liquid
state is called the heat of fusion; it is denoted by 
The heat of fusion of water 
is 
or, in proper SI units,
The heat
