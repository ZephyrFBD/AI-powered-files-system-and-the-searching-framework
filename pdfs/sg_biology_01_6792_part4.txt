escription of sarcomere 
(e.g., A-band, Z-line, etc.) 
 
 
* Shortening of sarcomere (unit) 
causes contraction 
• sliding of actin filaments during 
contraction 
• number of groups of sarcomeres 
regulate strength of muscle 
contraction 
 
* Cause a muscle fiber (muscle)  
to contract (shorten) in the 
muscular system (muscle) OR 
movement in muscle 
Neuron 
* Cell with dendrites and axon OR 
axon and dendrites and cell body 
OR nerve cell with cytoplasmic 
extensions  
• myelin sheath/Node of Ranvier 
• plasma membrane (neurilemma) 
• Na+/K+ pump-gated channels 
• synaptic knobs/dendrite membrane 
receptors 
• axon hillock (i.e., neck of cell 
body) 
 
 
* Generate/conduct/transmit 
impulses (electrical/chemical 
signals or messages)  
• speed of impulse transmission 
• change in membrane polarity 
• change in membrane polarity 
• neurotransmitters 
• origin of depolarization 
 
 
* Conduct impulses (electrical/ 
chemical signals or messages) in 
the nervous system
