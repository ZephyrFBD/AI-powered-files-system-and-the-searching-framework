nzymatic action of CA. The carbon
dioxide produced is expelled through the lungs during exhalation.
CO2  + H2 O ↔
H2 CO3
(carbonic acid) ↔HCO3  + H+
(bicarbonate)
 
The benefit of the bicarbonate buffer system is that carbon dioxide is “soaked up” into the blood with little change to the pH
of the system. This is important because it takes only a small change in the overall pH of the body for severe injury or death
to result. The presence of this bicarbonate buffer system also allows for people to travel and live at high altitudes: When
the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide change at high altitudes, the bicarbonate buffer system adjusts to regulate
carbon dioxide while maintaining the correct pH in the body.
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
While carbon dioxide can readily associate and dissociate from hemoglobin, other molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO)
cannot. Carbon monoxide has a greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen. Therefore, when carbon monoxide is present,
it bi
