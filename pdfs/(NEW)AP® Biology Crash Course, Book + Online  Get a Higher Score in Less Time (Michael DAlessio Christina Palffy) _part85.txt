 the genetic
makeup of many of these disorders and develop tests and treatments for them, who or what owns this
knowledge? Can a gene or a test for a gene be patented? Do insurance companies have “rights” to
prescreenings done by individuals who are at higher risks for carrying certain genes, like those that are
linked to breast cancer?
I.
Linked Genes—the alleles of two genes located on the same chromosome often do not show independent
assortment; instead, they exhibit a special type of inheritance called linkage.
1. If two genes are located close together on the same chromosome, they do not assort independently
because they are physically linked to each other.
2. Example of Linked Genes Experiment—Thomas Hunt Morgan performed genetic crosses with the fruit
fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and used the following terms:
i.
Wild type—most common phenotype in the population.
ii. Mutants—alternative phenotypes to the wild type.
3. Morgan performed the following dihybrid mating:
Example: In f
