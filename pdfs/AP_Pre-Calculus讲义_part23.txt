range of f. 
(c) Find the intervals on which f is increasing and on which f is decreasing. 
 
 
 
 
 
1.2.3 Increasing and Decreasing Functions 
The function value f(a) is a local maximum value of f if

³
 
(This means that f(a) ≥ f(b) for all x in some open interval containing a.) In this case we say 
that f has a local maximum at x = a. 
The function value f(a) is a local minimum value of f if

£
 
(This means that f(a) ≤ f(b) for all x in some open interval containing a.) In this case we say 
that f has a local minimum at x = a.

1.3 Rate of Change 
1.3.1 Average Rate of Change 
We are all familiar with the concept of speed: If you drive a distance of 120 miles in 2 
hours, then your average speed, or rate of travel, is 
=
120mi
60mi/h.
2h
 
Now suppose you take a car trip and record the distance tha
