called ortho, meta, and para:

Orbital Overlap; Hybrid Orbitals  
(Sections 9.4 and 9.5)
 9.45 For each statement, indicate whether it is true or false. (a) In 
order to make a covalent bond, the orbitals on each atom in 
the bond must overlap. (b) A p orbital on one atom cannot 
make a bond to an s orbital on another atom. (c) Lone pairs 
of electrons on an atom in a molecule influence the shape of 
a molecule. (d) The 1s orbital has a nodal plane. (e) The 2p 
orbital has a nodal plane.
 9.46  Draw sketches illustrating the overlap between the follow-
ing orbitals on two atoms: (a) the 2s orbital on each atom, 
 
(b) the 2pz orbital on each atom (assume both atoms are on 
the z-axis), (c) the 2s orbital on one atom and the 2pz orbital 
on the other atom.
 9.47 For each statement, indicate whether it is true or false. (a) The 
greater the orbital overlap
