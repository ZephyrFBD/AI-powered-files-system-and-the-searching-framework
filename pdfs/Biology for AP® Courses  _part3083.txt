 to the brain is directed to one of the specialized areas of the cerebrum;
for example, association areas for hearing are localized in the temporal lobe. The cerebellum helps coordinate skeletal
muscle activity, and the medulla oblongata and pons in the brainstem are centers for vital functions, such as breathing and
heart rate. Although localization of functions occurs, most complex functions, like language, involve neurons in multiple
brain regions. In terms of energy, since the brain consumes about 20 percent of the body’s resources (ATP), is it any
wonder that you’re exhausted after taking an AP® test? Information from the brain travels down the spinal cord, making
connections with peripheral nerves; thus, the spinal cord transmits sensory and motor input and controls motor reflexes, like
the automatic responses when the pupils of your eye constrict in bright sunlight or when your jerk your hand away from
something hot.
