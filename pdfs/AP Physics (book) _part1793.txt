through a closed surface—a surface of any
shape that encloses a volume of space. For any such surface, such as that shown in
Fig. 16–44, we divide the surface up into many tiny areas,
and so on. We make the division so that each 
is small enough that it can be
considered flat and so that the electric field can be considered constant through
each 
Then the total flux through the entire surface is the sum over all the
individual fluxes through each of the tiny areas:
where the symbol 
means “sum of.” We saw in Section 16–8 that the number
of field lines starting on a positive charge or ending on a negative charge is
proportional to the magnitude of the charge. Hence, the net number of lines N
pointing out of any closed surface (number of lines pointing out minus the number
pointing in) must be proportional to the net charge enclosed by the surface,
But from Eq. 16–8, we have that the net number of lines N is proportional to 
the total flux 
Therefore,
The constant of proportionality, to
