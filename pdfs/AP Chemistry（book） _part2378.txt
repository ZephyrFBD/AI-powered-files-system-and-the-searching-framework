essions are different from rate laws.
The value of the equilibrium constant at any given temperature does not depend on 
the initial amounts of reactants and products. It also does not matter whether other sub-
stances are present, as long as they do not react with a reactant or a product. The value of 
Kc depends only on the particular reaction and on the temperature.
Write the equilibrium expression for Kc for the following reactions:
(a) 2 O31g2 ∆ 3 O21g2
(b) 2 NO1g2 + Cl21g2 ∆ 2 NOCl1g2
(c) Ag+1aq2 + 2 NH31aq2 ∆ Ag1NH322
+1aq2
Sample Exercise 15.1
 Writing Equilibrium-Constant Expressions
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given three equations and are asked to write an 
equilibrium-constant expression for each.
Plan Using the law of mass action, we write each expression as a 
quotient having the product concentration terms in the numer-
ator and the reactant concentration terms in the denominator. 
Each concentration term is raised to the power of its coefficient in 
the balanced chemical eq
