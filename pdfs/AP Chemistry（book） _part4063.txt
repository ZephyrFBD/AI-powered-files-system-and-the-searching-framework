12.1 The red-orange compound is more likely to be a semicon-
ductor and the white one an insulator. The red-orange compound 
absorbs light in the visible spectrum (red-orange is reï¬‚ected, so 
blue-green is absorbed), while the white compound does not. This 
indicates that the red-orange compound has a lower energy electron 
transition than the white one. Semiconductors have lower energy 
electron transitions than insulators. 12.5 (a) The structure is hex-
agonal close-packed. (b) The coordination number, CN, is twelve. 
(c) CN(1) = 9, CN(2) = 6. 12.7 Fragment (b) is more likely to give 
rise to electrical conductivity. Arrangement (b) has a delocalized p 
system, in which electrons are free to move. Mobile electrons are 
required for electrical conductivity. 12.9 We expect linear polymer 
(a), with ordered regions, to be more crystalline and to have a higher 
melting point than branched polymer (b). 12.11
