Equations 2–11 are valid only when
the acceleration is constant, which we

SOLUTION (a) Of the above four equations, Eq. 2–11c will give us 
when
we know 
a, x, and
This runway length is not sufficient, because the minimum speed is not reached.
(b) Now we want to find the minimum runway length,
for a plane to reach
given 
We again use Eq. 2–11c, but rewritten as
A 200-m runway is more appropriate for this plane.
NOTE We did this Example as if the plane were a particle, so we round off
our answer to 200 m.
