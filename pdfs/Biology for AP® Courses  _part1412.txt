en, however, have two
copies of the X chromosome and therefore two copies of the gene. Therefore, women who inherit the variant allele will
most likely also have a normal allele to counteract its effects. It is important to note that many men inherit the variant copy
of MAOA and only some commit violent crimes. The environment seems to play a much more critical role. You can read

13.1 | Chromosomal Theory and Genetic Linkages
In this section, you will explore the following question:
•
What is the relationship among genetic linkage, crossing over, and genetic variation?
Connection for AP® Courses
Proposed independently by Sutton and Boveri in the early 1900s, the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance states that
chromosomes are vehicles of genetic heredity. As we have discovered, patterns of inheritance are more complex than
Mendel could
