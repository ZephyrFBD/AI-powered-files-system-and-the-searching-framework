8. How can a neutron, with practically no kinetic energy,
excite a nucleus to the extent shown in Fig. 31–3?
9. Why would a porous block of uranium be more likely to
explode if kept under water rather than in air?
10. A reactor that uses highly enriched uranium can use ordi-
nary water (instead of heavy water) as a moderator and
still have a self-sustaining chain reaction. Explain.

11. Why must the fission process release neutrons if it is to be
useful?
12. Why are neutrons released in a fission reaction?
13. What is the reason for the “secondary system” in a nuclear
reactor, Fig. 31–8? That is, why is the water heated by the
fuel in a nuclear reactor not used directly to drive the
turbines?
14. What is the basic difference between fission and fusion?

pollution and safety, of powe
