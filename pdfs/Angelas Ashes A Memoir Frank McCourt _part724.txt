 rap, kick, push.We ring and buzz bells.We shout and whistle,Telegram 
 
 boy, telegram boy.We drop telegrams in letter boxes, shove them under 
 
 doors, throw them over the transom.We climb in windows where people 
 
 are bedridden.We fight off every dog who wants to turn us into dinner.

 their telegrams.They laugh and sing and dance and cry and scream and 
 
 fall down in a weakness and you wonder if they’ll wake up at all and

 Mickey Rooney rides around in a film called The Human Comedy and 
 
  
  
 people are pleasant and falling over themselves to give you a tip, inviting 
 
 you in, giving you a cup of tea and a bun.

 myself.
