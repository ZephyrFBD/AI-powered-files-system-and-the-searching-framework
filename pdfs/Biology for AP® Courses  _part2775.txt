97. A plant has a measured pressure potential Ψp =
0.21MPa and a solute potential Ψs =-3.50MPa. The soil is
saturated with water because it rained. How will the water
move? After three months of dry weather, the soil has
dried out. How will the water potential of the soil compare
to the water potential measured immediately before the
rain? How will the stomata respond to the change in
weather?
a.
The water will move from the plant to the soil.
Dry soil has a lower water potential than wet
soil. Under drought conditions, the stomata close
to conserve water and leaves may also be shed if
the drought continues.
b.
The water will move from the soil to the plant.
Dry soil has a higher water potential than wet
soil. Under drought conditions, the stomata close
to conserve water and leaves may also be shed if
the drought continues.
c.
The water will move from the soil to the plant.
Dry soil has a lower water potential than wet
soil. Under dr
