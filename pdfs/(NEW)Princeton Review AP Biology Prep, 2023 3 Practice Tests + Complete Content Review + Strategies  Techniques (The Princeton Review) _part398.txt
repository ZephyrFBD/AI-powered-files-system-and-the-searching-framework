 reduce the number of individuals in a population. Often called
the bottleneck effect or the founder effect, this occurs when only a few individuals are left to mate and regrow a
population. If those individuals were the only survivors due to random luck, that means that the alleles that are
present to regrow the population are just random alleles. They are not necessarily the fittest alleles. For example, if a
hurricane swept through and only 4 birds were left on an island, the traits that they have will be the traits of the
population going forward, even if those traits were not previously being selected for.
Gene flow can occur between different populations of the same species if individuals migrate to/from the
populations. In other words, new alleles are entering/exiting and the genetic diversity will change. Small populations
are more susceptible than large populations to this type of change.
Types of Selection
The situation with our moths is an example of directional selection. O
