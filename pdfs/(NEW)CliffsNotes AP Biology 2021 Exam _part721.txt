e the defenseless viceroy butterfly benefits by mimicking the
aposematic monarch butterfly.
10. B. Mutualism occurs when both organisms in the symbiosis benefit. In this example, the oxpeckers obtain food,
and the rhinos have parasites removed.
11. D. Snakes are MÃ¼llerian mimics when they both look alike and possess some kind of aposematic defense
(poisonous or unpalatable, for example).
12. C. The brightly colored, harmless snakes are Batesian mimics because they benefit from the defense mechanism
of the colorful snakes they resemble.
13. D. Species that make large parental investments in their offspring, such as oak trees, whose acorns require two
years to mature, or mammals that nurse their young, are K-selected species and are characteristic of the later stages
of succession.
14. C. Primary succession occurs on newly exposed substrates, previously uninhabited by living things. All of the
other choices would initiate secondary succession.
15. A. Photosynthesis removes CO2 from the a
