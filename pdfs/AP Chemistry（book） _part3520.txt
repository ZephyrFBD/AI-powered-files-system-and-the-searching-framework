 reduction potential of F2 is exceptionally 
high. As a result, fluorine gas readily oxidizes water:
 
F21aq2 + H2O1l2 ¡ 2 HF1aq2 + 1
2  O21g2  E° = 1.80 V 
[22.17]
Fluorine cannot be prepared by electrolytic oxidation of aqueous solutions of fluoride 
salts because water is oxidized more readily than F - . 
 (Section 20.9) In practice, the 
element is formed by electrolytic oxidation of a solution of KF in anhydrous HF.
Chlorine is produced mainly by electrolysis of either molten or aqueous sodium 
chloride. Both bromine and iodine are obtained commercially from brines containing 
the halide ions; the reaction used is oxidation with Cl2.
