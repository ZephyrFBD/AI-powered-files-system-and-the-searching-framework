yll to 
absorb light strongly in the visible region of the spectrum. As Figure 23.16 
shows, chlorophyll is green because it absorbs red light (maximum ab-
sorption at 655 nm) and blue light (maximum absorption at 430 nm) and 
transmits green light.
Photosynthesis is nature’s solar energy-conversion machine, and 
thus all living systems on Earth depend on photosynthesis for continued 
existence.

Because living systems have difficulty assimilating enough iron to 
satisfy their nutritional needs, iron-deﬁciency anemia is a common 
problem in humans. Chlorosis, an iron deﬁciency in plants that 
makes leaves turn yellow, is also commonplace.
Living systems have difficulty assimilating iron because 
most iron compounds found in nature are not very soluble in wa-
