hen people are severely dehydrated, their cells have less water and the water potential of their cells is
lower.
(b) If distilled water were used to rehydrate a person, too much water would enter the person’s cells and there
would be a risk of the blood cells bursting from the pressure caused by the excess water. A saline solution of
0.9%, which is the same concentration of saline that is normally seen in body cells, can rehydrate a severely
dehydrated person without running the risk of bursting the blood cells.
(c) Consuming a salt tablet would lead to water conservation.
(d) Consuming salt lowers the water potential of the person’s body cells, so less water would leave the cells as
sweat or urine.

and mass. Vegetables with a higher water potential than the surrounding 0.35 molar sucrose solution would
lose water and mass.
