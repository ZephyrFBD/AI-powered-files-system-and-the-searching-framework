bound form, which stimulates the continuous production of cAMP
by adenylyl cyclase. In turn, high cAMP levels activate the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which
pumps Cl– out of the cell.
Which stage of the signaling cycle by a G-protein-coupled receptor
is aﬀected by the action of cholera toxin?
Cholera toxin interferes with the binding of the signal
molecule with its cognate receptor.
(A)
The G-protein-coupled receptor activates dissociation of the
G-protein complex into subunits.
(B)
Activation of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase by a G-protein
subunit leads to increased levels of cAMP.
(C)
G-protein subunits reassemble to form an inactive G-protein
that can reattach to the receptor.
(D)
5. Many viruses elicit the biosynthesis of the protein interferons in
the cells they infect. The following diagrams show the synthesis of
antiviral proteins in cells immobilized on a solid substrate in
growth medium. Cell A is infected with a nonreplicating virus at
time zer
