t revolves 
around the pole as shown in Fig. 5–10. In what direction is the acceleration of
the ball, and what force causes the acceleration, assuming constant speed?
RESPONSE If the ball revolves in a horizontal plane as shown, then the accel-
eration points horizontally toward the center of the ball’s circular path (not
toward the top of the pole). The force responsible for the acceleration may not
be obvious at first, since there seems to be no force pointing directly horizontally.
But it is the net force (the sum of 
and 
here) that must point in the 
direction of the acceleration. The vertical component of the cord tension,
balances the ball’s weight,
The horizontal component of the cord tension,
is the force that produces the centripetal acceleration toward the center.
