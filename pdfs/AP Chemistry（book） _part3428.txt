 in Equations 21.26 through 21.29. 
Because 4
2He has a larger binding energy than any of its immediate 
neighbors (Figure 21.12), these reactions release an enormous amount 
of energy. This process, called hydrogen burning, is the dominant pro-
cess for most of a star’s lifetime.
Once a star’s supply of hydrogen is nearly exhausted, several 
important changes occur as the star enters the next the phase of its life, 
and is transformed into a red giant. The decrease in nuclear fusion causes 
the core to contract, triggering an increase in core temperature and pres-
sure. At the same time, the outer regions expand and cool enough to 
make the star emit red light (thus, the name red giant). The star now must 
use 4
2He nuclei as its fuel. The simplest reaction that can occur in the 
He-rich core, fusion of two alpha particles to form a 8
4Be nucleus, does 
occur. The binding energy per nucleon for 8
4Be is very slightly smaller 
than that for 4
2He, so this fusion process is very slightl
