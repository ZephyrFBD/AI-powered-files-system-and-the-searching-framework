Questions
Objects that move vertically near the surface of the Earth,
either falling or having been projected vertically up or down,
move with the constant downward acceleration due to gravity,
whose magnitude is
if air resistance can be
ignored. We can apply Eqs. 2–11 for constant acceleration to
objects that move up or down freely near the Earth’s surface.
The slope of a curve at any point on a graph is the slope
of the tangent to the curve at that point. On a graph of posi-
tion vs. time, the slope is equal to the instantaneous velocity.
On a graph of velocity vs. time, the slope is the acceleration.
