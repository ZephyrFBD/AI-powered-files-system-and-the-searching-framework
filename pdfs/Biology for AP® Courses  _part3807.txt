Externally, the kidneys are surrounded by three layers. The outermost layer is the renal fascia, the second
layer is the perineal fat capsule, and the third layer is the renal capsule. Internally, the kidney has three layers:
an outer cortex, the middle hilum, and the inner renal pelvis.
Kidney Function and Physiology
Kidneys filter blood in a three-step process. First, the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the
glomerulus. Almost all solutes, except for proteins, are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called glomerular
filtration. Second, the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules. Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process
called tubular reabsorption. In the loop of Henle, the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal
medulla and the peritubular capilla
