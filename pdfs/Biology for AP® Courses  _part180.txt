bonds—along with ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds—contribute to the three-dimensional structure
of the proteins in our cells that is necessary for their proper function.

Pharmaceutical chemists are responsible for the development of new drugs and trying to determine the
mode of action of both old and new drugs. They are involved in every step of the drug development process.
Drugs can be found in the natural environment or can be synthesized in the laboratory. In many cases,
potential drugs found in nature are changed chemically in the laboratory to make them safer and more
effective, and sometimes synthetic versions of drugs substitute for the version found in nature.
After the initial discovery or synthesis of a drug, the chemist then develops the drug, perhaps chemically
altering it, testing it to see if the drug is toxic, and then designing methods for efficient large-scale production.
Then, the process of getting the drug approved
