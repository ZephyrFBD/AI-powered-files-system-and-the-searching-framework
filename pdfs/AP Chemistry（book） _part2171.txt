he critical micelle concentration (cmc). Micelles con-
tain dozens to hundreds of molecules. The cmc depends 
on the substance, the solvent, and the temperature.
 
 
At and above the cmc, the properties of the solution vary 
drastically.

The speed at which a chemical reaction occurs is called the  reaction 
rate. One mechanism for controlling reaction rate is to adjust the tem-
perature. Reaction rates slow down as the temperature decreases and 
speed up when the temperature increases. The chemical reactions that 
govern the metabolism of food, the transport of essential nutrients, and 
many other important physiological processes in the human body must 
proceed with the appropriate speeds. To do so, itâ€™s essential that our 
internal body temperature remain relatively constant regardless of the 
outside temperature. However, not all mammals operate within these 
strict confines. The body temperatures of animals that hibernate during 
the cold winter months often drop considerably in
