barriers. One example might be that a particular zygote is not
viable. Both prezygotic and postzygotic barriers result in
reproductive isolation.
PATTERNS OF EVOLUTION
The evolution of different species is classified into five patterns: divergent,
convergent, parallel, coevolution, and adaptive radiation; see Figure 11.5.
Divergent Evolution
Divergent evolution occurs when a population becomes isolated (for any
reason) from the rest of the species, becomes exposed to new selective
pressures, and evolves into a new species. All the examples of allopatric
and sympatric speciation that were discussed previously are examples of
divergent evolution.
Convergent Evolution
When unrelated species occupy the same environment, they are subjected
to similar selective pressures and show similar adaptations. The classic
example of convergent evolution is the whale, which has the streamlined
appearance of a shark because the two evolved in the same environment.
