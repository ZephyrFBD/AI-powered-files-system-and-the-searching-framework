Try changing your p value to 0.8 or 0.9. Does the spreadsheet still work as expected? Try 
lower p values. If you don’t get approximately the expected numbers, check and recheck 
your formulas now, while it is early in the process.

You could stop here and just have the computer recalculate over and over — similar 
to tossing a coin. However, with just a few more steps, you can have a model that will 
create a small number or large number of gametes for the next generation, count the 
different genotypes of the zygotes, and graph the results. 
Copy these two formulas in E5 and F5 down for about 16 rows to represent gametes 
that will form 16 offspring for the next generation, as in Figure 4. (To copy the formulas, 
click on the bottom right-hand corner of the cell and, with your finger pressed down on 
the mouse, drag the cell downward.)

We’ll put the zygotes in cell G5. The zygote is a combination of th
