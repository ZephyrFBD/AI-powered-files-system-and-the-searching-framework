s used. This is because the rate of 
a reaction or process is what mathematicians call a dependent variable. Time is the 
independent variable in this experiment; it is independent of changes in the dependent 
variable (the rate of reaction), and it is the variable that is shown on the horizontal axis. 
Regardless of whether the process is the increase in height or weight of a plant, or the 
using up or producing of something in a reaction, the rate graph for the process must 
always show amount of something per unit time on one of its axes. One very common 
type of rate graph is the one shown in Figure A.11, with a rate on the ordinate and the 
time on the abscissa. Other kinds of rate graphs may have temperature or molarity on 
the abscissa. The rate of growth of a plant, for example, depends on how many factors 
that we might wish to vary, and so we can have as many different kinds of rate graphs for 
that process as there are independent variables.
