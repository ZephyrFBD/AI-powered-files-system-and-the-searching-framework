chains of lysine and arginine are positively charged, and therefore these
amino acids are also known as basic amino acids. Proline has an R group that is linked to the amino group, forming a ring-
like structure. Proline is an exception to the standard structure of an animo acid since its amino group is not separate from
the side chain (Figure 3.25).
Amino acids are represented by a single upper case letter or a three-letter abbreviation. For example, valine is known by
the letter V or the three-letter symbol val. Just as some fatty acids are essential to a diet, some amino acids are necessary
as well. They are known as essential amino acids, and in humans they include isoleucine, leucine, and cysteine. Essential

amino acids refer to those necessary for construction of proteins in the body, although not produced by the body; which
amino acids are essential varies from organism to organism.
The sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately d
