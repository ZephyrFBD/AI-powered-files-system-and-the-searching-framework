le applies to the airways. A
small amount of surfactant to the airway tissues reduces the effort or work needed to inflate those airways. Babies born
prematurely sometimes do not produce enough surfactant. As a result, they suffer from respiratory distress syndrome,
because it requires more effort to inflate their lungs. Surfactant is also important for preventing collapse of small alveoli
relative to large alveoli.
Lung Resistance and Compliance
Pulmonary diseases reduce the rate of gas exchange into and out of the lungs. Two main causes of decreased gas exchange
are compliance (how elastic the lung is) and resistance (how much obstruction exists in the airways). A change in either
can dramatically alter breathing and the ability to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.
Examples of restrictive diseases are respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. In both diseases, the airways are
less compliant and they are stiff or fibrotic. There is a decrease in compliance because
