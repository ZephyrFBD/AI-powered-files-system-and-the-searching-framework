rectly identifies that although chromatids are 
duplicated after the G2 checkpoint, they still form 78 chromosome pairs. 
This number is halved after meiosis, during gamete formation, and does 
not remain the same. After fertilization, the number is doubled as the 
chromosomes from two gametes are combined.
