 information about DNA sequences grows, scientists will become closer to mapping a more accurate
evolutionary history of all life on Earth.
What makes phylogeny difficult, especially among prokaryotes, is the transfer of genes horizontally (horizontal gene
transfer, or HGT) between unrelated species. Like mutations, HGT introduces genetic variation into the bacterial
population. This passing of genes between species adds a layer of complexity to understanding relatedness.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP速
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP速 exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
