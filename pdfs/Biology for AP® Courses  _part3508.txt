e. The Z discs mark the border
of units called sarcomeres, which are the functional units of skeletal muscle. One sarcomere is the space between two
consecutive Z discs and contains one entire A band and two halves of an I band, one on either side of the A band. A
myofibril is composed of many sarcomeres running along its length, and as the sarcomeres individually contract, the
myofibrils and muscle cells shorten (Figure 29.35).
Figure 29.35 A sarcomere is the region from one Z line to the next Z line. Many sarcomeres are present in a myofibril,
resulting in the striation pattern characteristic of skeletal muscle.
Myofibrils are composed of smaller structures called myofilaments. There are two main types of filaments: thick filaments
and thin filaments; each has different compositions and locations. Thick filaments occur only in the A band of a myofibril.
Thin filaments attach to a protein in the Z disc called alpha-actinin and occur across the entire length of the I band and
partway i
