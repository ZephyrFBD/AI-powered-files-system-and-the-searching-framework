 total number of ATP generated from a single pyruvate is 15
ATP.
b. The Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation occur in the mitochondria. The Krebs cycle occurs in the matrix
of the
mitochondria. The protein carriers for the electron transport chain are embedded in the inner mitochondrial
membranes, called the cristae. Thus, oxidative phosphorylation occurs in these cristae membranes.
c. Chemiosmosis describes how ATP is generated from ADP + Pi.
 
During oxidative phosphorylation, H+ (protons) are deposited on the
outside of the cristae, between the cristae and the outer membrane. The excess number of protons in this
intermembrane space creates a pH and electric gradient. The gradient provides the energy to generate ATP as
protons pass back into the matrix through ATP synthase, a channel protein in the cristae.
