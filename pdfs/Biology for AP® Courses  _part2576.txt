fission.
c.

74. Health officials worldwide are concerned about
antibiotic resistance in bacteria that cause disease. In
patients infected with nonresistant strains of the bacterium
that causes tuberculosis, antibiotics can relieve symptoms
fastâ€”in as short of a time as a few weeks. However, it
takes much longer to stop infection entirely, and patients
may discontinue treatment once symptoms are abated. In a
hypothetical study, researchers found a much higher
incidence of recurrent tuberculosis infection in patients
who discontinued treatment once symptoms were relieved,
but before the planned course of treatment was complete.
