would increase because enzyme-catalyzed reactions are always
slower at higher temperatures.
(C) The average time for the disks to float would decrease because boiling increased the number of molecular
collisions between the enzymes and substrates.
(D) The average time for the disks to float would increase because enzyme-catalyzed reactions are always
faster at higher temperatures.
3. A student graphs this data, showing 95% confidence intervals. Based on the 95% confidence intervals, which
concentrations of enzyme are least likely to have statistically significant differences?
(A) 1% and 3%
(B) 1% and 6%
(C) 3% and 6%
(D) None of the enzyme concentrations used are likely to have statistically significant differences.
4. BCR-ABL is an enzyme found in cancer cells in chronic myelogenous leukemia. ATP binds to the active site of
BCR-ABL, which then stimulates cell division in cancer cells. Which of the following would most likely slow
the rate of cell division in cancer cells with the BCR-
