. Fish is often served with a wedge of 
lemon, which contains citric acid. The amine and the acid 
react forming a product with no odor, thereby making 
the less-than-fresh fish more appetizing. Using data from 
Appendix D, calculate the equilibrium constant for the 
reaction of citric acid with methylamine, if only the first 
proton of the citric acid 1Ka12 is important in the neutral-
ization reaction.
 16.102  Which, if any, of the following statements are true?
 
 (a) The stronger the base, the smaller the pKb.
 
 (b) The stronger the base, the larger the pKb.
 
 (c) The stronger the base, the smaller the Kb.
 
 (d) The stronger the base, the larger the Kb.
 
 (e)  
The stronger the base, the smaller the pKa of its conju-
gate acid.
 
 (f)  
The stronger the base, the larger the pKa  of its conjugate 
acid.
 16.103  Predict how each molecule or ion would act, in the Brønsted- 
Lowry sense, in aqueous solution by writing “acid,” “base,” 
“both,” or “neither” on the line provided.
