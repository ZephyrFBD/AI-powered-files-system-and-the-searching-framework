Calculate the gross primary productivity for the observed sample. Express your answer in mg fixed carbon/L/day to
the nearest hundredth.
3. A digestive enzyme was isolated from the intestines of 1,000 cockroaches selected randomly from a large
population. The enzyme was evaluated with gel electrophoresis. Three banding patterns were observed and the
number of individuals for each pattern is indicated in the following figure:
Calculate the frequency for the allele with the highest frequency for the gene locus coding for this enzyme. Express
your answer to the nearest hundredth.
4. If genes A, B, C, and D are unlinked and autosomal, what is the probability of producing an individual with the
genotype AaBbCcDd from the cross AABBccdd Ã— aabbCCDD? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest
hundredth.
5. The following graph shows the effect of an enzyme on activation energy. Plot A is the progress of the reaction
without an enzyme, and plot B is the same
