lso, reflect on remedies for these problems.
PRACTICE QUESTIONS
In 2011, a giant earthquake caused a tsunami that flooded the
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan. The flooding
caused the cores of the nuclear reactors to melt down, releasing tons
of radioactive materials into the environment. Although most sea life
in the nearby Pacific Ocean survived the initial exposure to massive
amounts of radiation, scientists are uncertain about what will happen
in the future.
Which of the following statements describes the most likely
consequence of such a release of radioactive material into the
environment and includes appropriate evidence to support that
description?
All sea life will be wiped out in five years because radiation
kills living things.
Plant-eating animals will die within five years, which will
cause the food chain to collapse because upper trophic levels
feed on lower ones.
Radioactive materials will enter the aquatic food web and hurt
the top predators because toxins
