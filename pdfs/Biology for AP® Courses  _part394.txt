gaff’s data in terms of the partial charges
on these molecules to show how molecular interactions
affect the function of these molecules in the storage and
retrieval of biological information.

The interactions between nucleobase molecules are strong
enough to produce the association of pairs observed in
Chargaff’s data. However, these pairs are bonded by much
weaker hydrogen bonds, chemical bonds within the
molecules.
Demonstrating an understanding of the replication of DNA
requires the ability to explain how the two polymer strands
of the double helix interact and grow. To retrieve
information from DNA, the strands must be separated. The
proteins that perform that task interact with the polymer
without forming new chemical bonds. In their paper
(Watson and Crick, Nature, 3, 1953) announcing the
structure of the polymer that we consider in this problem,
Watson and Crick stated, “It has not escaped our notice
that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately
suggests
