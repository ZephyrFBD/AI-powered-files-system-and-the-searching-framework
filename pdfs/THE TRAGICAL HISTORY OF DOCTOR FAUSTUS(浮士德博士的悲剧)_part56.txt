:  we look
not like cup-stealers, I can tell you.
VINTNER. Never deny't, for I know you have it; and I'll search you.
ROBIN. Search me! ay, and spare not. --Hold the cup, Dick [Aside to
DICK, giving him the cup].-- Come, come, search me, search me.
[VINTNER searches him.]
VINTNER. Come on, sirrah, let me search you now.
DICK. Ay, ay, do, do. --Hold the cup, Robin [Aside to ROBIN, giving
him the cup].-- I fear not your searching: we scorn to steal your<141>
cups, I can tell you.
[VINTNER searches him.]
VINTNER. Never out-face me for the matter; for, sure, the cup is
between you two.
ROBIN. Nay, there you lie; 'tis beyond us both.
VINTNER. A plague take you! I thought 'twas your knavery to take it
away:  come, give it me again.
ROBIN. Ay, much!<142> when, can you tell?--Dick, make me a circle,
and stand close at my back, and stir not for thy life.--Vintner, you shall
have your cup anon.--Say nothing, Dick.--[Reads from a book] O per se, O;
Demogorgon; Belcher, and Mephistophilis!
