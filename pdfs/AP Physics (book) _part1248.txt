ing typical speeds of 
and 
for P and S
waves, respectively, how far away did an earthquake
occur if a particular seismic station detects the arrival of
these two types of waves 1.5 min apart? (b) Is one seismic
station sufficient to determine the position of the epicenter?
Explain.

supports 8.0 m apart. If the tension in the cord is 120 N,
how long will it take a pulse to travel from one support to
the other?

41. (II) A 0.40-kg cord is stretched between two supports,
8.7 m apart. When one support is struck by a hammer,
a transverse wave travels down the cord and reaches the
other support in 0.85 s. What is the tension in the cord?
