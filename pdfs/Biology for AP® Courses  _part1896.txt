 sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method (also known
as the dideoxy method), which was developed by Fred Sanger in the 1970s. The chain termination method involves DNA
replication of a single-stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide (dNTP), which is a
monomer, or a single unit, of DNA. The primer and dNTP are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled
dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). The ddNTPs are monomers that are missing a hydroxyl group (â€“OH) at the site at which
another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain (Figure 17.12). Each ddNTP is labeled with a different color of
fluorophore. Every time a ddNTP is incorporated in the growing complementary strand, it terminates the process of DNA
replication, which results in multiple short strands of replicated DNA that are each terminated at a different point during
replication. When the reaction mixture is processed by gel electrophoresis
