, contain at least one C “C double bond.
t Alkynes contain at least one C ‚C triple bond.
t Aromatic hydrocarbons have carbon atoms that are connected in a planar ring struc-
ture, joined by both s and delocalized p bonds between carbon atoms. 
 (Section 8.6)
An example of each type is shown in Table 24.1.
Each type of hydrocarbon exhibits different chemical behaviors, as we will see 
shortly. The physical properties of all four types, however, are similar in many ways. 
Because hydrocarbon molecules are relatively nonpolar, they are almost completely 
insoluble in water but dissolve readily in nonpolar solvents. Their melting points and 
boiling points are determined by dispersion forces. 
 (Section 11.2) As a result, hydro-
carbons of very low molecular weight, such as C2H6 1bp = -89 °C2, are gases at room 
temperature; those of moderate molecular weight, such as C6H14 1bp = 69 °C2, are liq-
uids; and those of high molecular weight, such as C22H46 1mp = 44 °C2, are solids.
