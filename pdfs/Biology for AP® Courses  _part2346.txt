The viral genome is double-stranded DNA, but viral DNA
is replicated through an RNA intermediate; the RNA may
serve directly as mRNA or as a template to make mRNA

Viruses differ from other organisms in their method of replication. Viruses replicate within a living host cell, producing
changes in the cell that often result in the death of the infected cell. Thus, viruses are considered intracellular parasites.
Viral replication involves several steps: attachme
