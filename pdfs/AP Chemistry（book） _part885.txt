CHAPTER 6 Electronic Structure of Atoms
6.2 ∣ Quantized Energy and Photons
Although the wave model of light explains many aspects of the behavior of light, several 
observations cannot be resolved by this model. Three of these are particularly pertinent 
to our understanding of how electromagnetic radiation and atoms interact: (1) the emis-
sion of light from hot objects (referred to as blackbody radiation because the objects stud-
ied appear black before heating), (2) the emission of electrons from metal surfaces on 
which light shines (the photoelectric effect), and (3) the emission of light from electroni-
cally excited gas atoms (emission spectra). We examine the first two phenomena here and 
the third in Section 6.3.
