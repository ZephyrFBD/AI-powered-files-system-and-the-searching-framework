THE INVESTIGATIONS 
■ Getting Started: Prelab Assessment 
Investigating biology requires a variety of skills. The skills reinforced and introduced 
vary across the laboratories in this manual. The skills emphasized in a laboratory dictate 
whether a prelab assessment is appropriate.  
This particular investigation provides a lab environment, guidance, and a problem 
designed to help students understand how populations of organisms respond to 
selection. To gain the maximum benefit from this exercise, students should get started 
and not do too much background preparation so that they can build understanding from 
their own work. 
■ Designing and Conducting Independent Investigations 
To set the stage for student-centered investigations, consider presenting a number of 
probing questions to the class that center on artificial selection in agricul
