cies may no longer
exist, and the habitat may be more favorable to new species. Some of the changes induced by resident species are
listed below:
1. Substrate texture may change from solid rock, to sand, to fertile soil, as rock erodes and the decomposition of
plants and animals occurs. 2. Soil pH may decrease due to the decomposition of certain organic matter, such as
acidic leaves.
 
3. Soil water potential, or the ability of the soil to retain water, changes as the soil texture changes.
 
4. Light availability may change from full sunlight, to partly shady, to near darkness as trees become established.
 
5. Crowding, which increases with population growth, may be unsuitable to certain species.
Succession is often described by the series of plant communities that inhabit a region over time. Animals, too, take
up residence in these communities but usually in response to their attraction to the kinds of resident plants, not
because of any way in which previous animals have changed the
