terminal into the synaptic cleft, where they can then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to a receptor molecule on the
motor end plate. The motor end plate possesses junctional folds—folds in the sarcolemma that create a large surface area
for the neurotransmitter to bind to receptors. The receptors are actually sodium channels that open to allow the passage of
Na+ into the cell when they receive neurotransmitter signal.
Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter released by motor neurons that binds to receptors in the motor end plate.
Neurotransmitter release occurs when an action potential travels down the motor neuron’s axon, resulting in altered
permeability of the synaptic terminal membrane and an influx of calcium. The Ca2+ ions allow synaptic vesicles to move to
and bind with the presynaptic membrane (on the neuron), and release neurotransmitter from the vesicles into the synaptic
cleft. Once released by the synaptic terminal, ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft t
