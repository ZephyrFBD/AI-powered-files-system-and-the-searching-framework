ration, with the value of n increasing as we move down each column.
In Table 6.2 we saw that the total number of orbitals in each shell equals n2: 1, 4, 9, 
or 16. Because we can place two electrons in each orbital, each shell accommodates up

to 2n2 electrons: 2, 8, 18, or 32. We see that the overall structure of the periodic  
table 
 
reflects these electron numbers: Each row of the table has 2, 8, 18, or 32 elements in it. 
As shown in Figure 6.30, the periodic table can be further divided into four blocks based 
on the filling order of orbitals. On the left are two blue columns of elements. These ele-
ments, known as the alkali metals (group 1A) and alkaline earth metals (group
