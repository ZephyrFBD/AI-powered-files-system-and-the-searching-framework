iation in a certain town
consists of 32 mrad of X-rays and 
rays plus 3.4 mrad of
particles having a RBE of 10. How many rem will a person
receive per year on average?
60. A shielded -ray source yields a dose rate of 
at
a distance of 1.0 m for an average-sized person. If workers
are allowed a maximum dose of 5.0 rem in 1 year, how
close to the source may they operate, assuming a 35-h
work week? Assume that the intensity of radiation falls off
as the square of the distance. (It actually falls off more
rapidly than 
because of absorption in the air, so your
answer will give a better-than-permissible value.)
61. Radon gas,
is formed by 
decay. (a) Write the
decay equation. (b) Ignoring the kinetic energy of the
daughter nucleus (itâ€™s so massive), estimate the kinetic
energy of the 
particle produced. (c) Estimate the
momentum of the alpha and of the daughter nucleus.
(d) Estimate the kinetic energy of the daughter, and show
that your approximation in (b) was valid.
