1. Consider the chemical reactions X and Y. The progress of each
reaction is plotted as a function of the free energy of the
compounds involved in the reaction.
Based on the free energy plots, a biochemist considers the
following hypotheses on whether the reactions would take place
in a living organism. Which of them is best supported by the
graphs?
Reaction X is endergonic and cannot take place in a living cell.
(A)
Reaction Y would proceed on its own without the input of
energy.
(B)
Reaction X would proceed if an enzyme lowered the free
energy of C+D.
(C)
Reaction X would proceed if it is coupled to reaction Y.
(D)
2. The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a
closed system must always increase. This means that such
systems always move to a more disordered state. However, cells
constantly synthesize macromolecules that are complex and
highly ordered. Which of the following statements best explains
the
