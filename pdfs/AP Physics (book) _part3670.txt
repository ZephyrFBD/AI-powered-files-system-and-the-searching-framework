, some 26,000 ly from the center. Our Galaxy contains roughly 400 billion
stars. The Sun orbits the galactic center approximately once every 
250 million years, so its speed is roughly 
relative to the center of the
Galaxy. The total mass of all the stars in our Galaxy is estimated to be about
of ordinary matter. There is also strong evidence that our Galaxy is perme-
ated and surrounded by a massive invisible “halo” of “dark matter” (Section 33–9).

outside: (a) “edge view,” in the plane of the disk; (b) “top view,”
looking down on the disk. (If only we could see it like this—
from the outside!) (c) Infrared photograph of the inner reaches
of the Milky Way, showing the central bulge and disk of our
Galaxy. This very wide angle photo taken from the COBE
satellite (Section 33–6) extends over 360° of sky. The white dots
are nearby stars.
