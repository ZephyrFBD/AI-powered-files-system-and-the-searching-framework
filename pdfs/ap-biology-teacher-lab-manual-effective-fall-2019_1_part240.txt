ritance patterns you 
discover. 
Try adding additional generations to your model to look at how allele frequencies 
change in multiple generations. To do this, use your newly recalculated p and 
 q values 
to seed the next generation. Once you’ve included the second generation, you should be 
able to copy additional generations so that your model looks something like Figure 9, 
with each new generation determining the new p and 
 q values for the next.

Try to create a graph of p values over several generations, for different-sized populations. 
See if you can detect a pattern of how population size affects the inheritance pattern. Be 
sure to try out both large and small populations of offspring. 
This model relies on the RAND function to randomly select gametes from an infinite 
gene pool.
