The three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a small fish found in both marine and freshwater 
environments. Marine stickleback populations consist mostly of individuals with pronounced pelvic spines, as 
shown in Figure 1. Individuals in freshwater stickleback populations, on the other hand, typically have reduced 
pelvic spines, as shown in Figure 2. 
As represented in Figure 1 and Figure 2, 
 the phenotypic difference between marine and freshwater sticklebacks 
involves Pitx1, a gene that influences the formation of the jaw, pituitary gland, and pelvic spine. Enhancer sequences 
upstream of the Pitx1 genetic locus regulate expression of the Pitx1 gene at the appropriate times an
