 since
the temperature change is small. For the hot water we use an average tempera-
ture of 23°C (296 K), and for the cold water an average temperature of 21°C
(294 K). Thus
which is negative because this heat flows out (sign conventions, page 413),
whereas heat is added to the cold water:
The entropy of the hot water 
decreases because heat flows out of the hot water.
But the entropy of the cold water 
increases by a greater amount. The total
change in entropy is

(general statement)
In Example 15–14, we saw that although the entropy of one part of the system
decreased, the entropy of the other part increased by a greater amount; the net
