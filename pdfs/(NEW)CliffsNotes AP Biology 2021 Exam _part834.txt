the bag is negativeâ€”the sum of the negative solute potential and a zero pressure potential (flaccid bag).
2. C. When the net movement into and out of the potato core is zero, the water potentials inside and outside the
potato core are the same, and there is no change in the mass of the potato core. A sucrose solution of 0.5 M shows a
0% change in mass on the graph.
3. D. When the net movement of water into a potato core is zero, the water potentials inside and outside the potato
core are the same, but not zero. Because the potato core immersed in the 0.2 M sucrose solution gained weight, the
water potential of its cells must have been smaller than the water potential of the sucrose solution. After 24 hours,
water that enters the potato core in the 0.2 M sucrose solution causes the potato cells to expand and gain weight.
Since the rigid cell walls cannot expand, pressure potential increases as the cell walls exert a restraining pressure on
the cell contents.
4. B. The initial rate of r
