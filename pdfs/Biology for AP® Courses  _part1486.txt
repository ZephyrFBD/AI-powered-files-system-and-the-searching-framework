auses death. When Griffith injected a mouse with the heat-killed S strain
and a live R strain, the mouse died. The S strain was recovered from the dead mouse. Thus, Griffith concluded that
something had passed from the heat-killed S strain to the R strain, transforming the R strain into S strain in the process.

Scientists Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty (1944) were interested in exploring this transforming
principle further. They isolated the S strain from the dead mice and isolated the proteins and nucleic acids, namely RNA and
DNA, as these were possible candidates for the molecule of heredity. They conducted a systematic elimination study. They
used enzymes that specifically degraded each component and then used each mixture separately to transform the R strain.
They found that when DNA was degraded, the resulting mixture was no longer able to transform t
