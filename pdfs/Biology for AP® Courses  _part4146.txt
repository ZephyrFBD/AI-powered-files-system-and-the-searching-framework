m the neural plate.
b.
The notochord cells of the mesoderm signal the
ectodermal cells to form epidermal cells as well
as the neural plate.
c.
Growth factors signal some of the ectodermal
cells to form epidermal cells, and the remaining
cells form neural crest cells.
d.
Proteins involved in the Wnt signaling pathway
signal the ectodermal cells to form the epidermal
cells and the neural plate.
59. What will be the outcome if the axis is not formed
during the developmental stages?
a.
The animal will possess two notochords and
may not have a dorsal-ventral or anterior-
posterior side.
b.
The animal will lack an anterior-posterior or
dorsal-ventral side and may not have complete
differentiation of cell layers.
c.
The animal will lack an anterior-posterior or
lateral-medial side and may not have complete
differentiation of cell layers.
d.
The animal will have incorrect positioning of the
dorsal-ventral and lateral-medial sides and
differentiation of cell layers will be incomplete.
