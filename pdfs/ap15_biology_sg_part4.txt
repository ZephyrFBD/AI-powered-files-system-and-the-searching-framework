igure 2, describe the activity pattern of the mice during the 
light and dark periods of the L12:D12 cycle. 
Description (1 point) 
• 
Active during dark phase AND inactive during light phase  
• 
Active ONLY during the dark period 
• 
Inactive ONLY during the light period 
 
(c) The researchers claim that the genetically controlled circadian rhythm in the mice does not follow a 
24-hour cycle. Describe ONE difference between the daily pattern of activity under L12:D12 
conditions (Figure 2) and under DD conditions (Figure 3), and use the data to support the 
researchers’ claim. 
Description (1 point) 
• 
Active period begins a little earlier each day 
• 
Active/inactive period is shorter than 12 hours each day 
• 
Daily circadian rhythm is less than 24 hours 
• 
Pattern of activity shifts each day  
 
Support (1 point) 
• 
Without light, active/inactive periods are determined only by the genetically controlled 
circadian rhythm. 
• 
If it were a 24-hour circadian rhythm, the pattern o
