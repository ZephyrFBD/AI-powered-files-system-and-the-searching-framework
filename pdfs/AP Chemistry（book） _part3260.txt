s generally the area having the largest supply of O2, rust often 
deposits there. If you look closely at a shovel after it has stood outside in the moist air 
with wet dirt adhered to its blade, you may notice that pitting has occurred under the 
dirt but that rust has formed elsewhere, where O2 is more readily available. The enhanced 
corrosion caused by the presence of salts is usually evident on autos in areas where roads 
are heavily salted during winter. Like a salt bridge in a voltaic cell, the ions of the salt pro-
vide the electrolyte necessary to complete the electrical circuit.
Preventing Corrosion of Iron
Objects made of iron are often covered with a coat of paint or another metal to protect 
against corrosion. Covering the surface with paint prevents oxygen and water from
