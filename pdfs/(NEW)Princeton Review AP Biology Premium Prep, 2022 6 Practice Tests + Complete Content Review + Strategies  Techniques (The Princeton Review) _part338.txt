tions to the Central Dogma? Do all genes get
turned into RNA and then into proteins?
Hint: rRNA, tRNA, and RNAi never get turned into protein; they stay as RNA.
There is also another class of RNA, called interfering RNAs, or RNAi. These are small snippets of RNA that are
naturally made in the body or intentionally created by humans. These interfering RNAs, called siRNA and miRNA,
can bind to specific sequences of RNA and mark them for destruction. This will be discussed more later in this
chapter. Now that we know about the different types of RNA, let’s see how they direct the synthesis of proteins.
Transcription
Transcription involves making an RNA copy of a bit of DNA code. The initial steps in transcription are similar to
the initial steps in DNA replication. The obvious difference is that, whereas in replication we end up with a complete
copy of the cell’s DNA, in transcription we end up with only a tiny specific section copied into an mRNA. This is
because only the bit of DNA that
