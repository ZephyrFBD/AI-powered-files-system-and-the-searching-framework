ast before and after treatment with a drug that
inhibits cell wall synthesis. As a measure of viability, you measure how much Myc mRNA was made in each
strain with and without treatment. In this case, each bar is a mean of values and the error bars are ±SE, as
described above.
Box-and-whisker plots should be used for nonparametric data. These graphs show median (horizontal line),
quartiles (top and bottom of the box), and largest and smallest values (ticks at the tops and bottoms of the lines).
In other words, the middle 50% of plant weights is represented by the box, with the median shown with the line,
and the highest and lowest values are marked with the top and bottom extenders (whiskers). Remember, the
median is not the average, so the line doesn’t have to be in the middle. Suppose the weights of two types of
Arizona plants are measured, to determine which is more plentiful in a given niche:
Grass and Cactus Weights in the Arizona Desert
In order to conclude that the samples or gr
