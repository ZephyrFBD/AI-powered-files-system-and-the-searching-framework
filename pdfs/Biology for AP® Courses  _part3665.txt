e output is at the diaphragm. The signal is
processed in the respiratory centers (RCs) of the medulla
in the brainstem.
A. Describe how the nervous system integrates
information about oxygen concentration in the blood to
maintain homeostasis. In your description include the
concepts of negative feedback and a set point.
An alternative model (Evens et al., Biochemical Journal,
473, 2016) of the response to oxygen deprivation is
suggested by the observation that high-altitude Andean
populations have a gene for a protein kinase (AMPK
encoded by PRKAA1) that has a fixed single nucleotide
variation. This AMP-activated kinase is coupled with
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to detect reduced
oxygen and signal the RCs of the medulla directlyâ€”a
distributed network for detection and response. The
authors of this work note that a homologous gene in yeast
allows colony-wide signaling to switch individuals in the
colony from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation in
response to changes in
