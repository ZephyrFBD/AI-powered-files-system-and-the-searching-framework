s occur when two different chromosomes (or a single chromosome in two different places) break
and rejoin in a way that causes the DNA sequence or gene to be lost, repeated, or interrupted.
5. Transposons are gene segments that can cut/paste themselves throughout the genome. The presence of a
transposon can interrupt a gene and cause errors in gene expression.
Errors in Meiosis
Nondisjunction occurs when the chromosomes are not separated correctly
during meiosis. This can cause entire chromosomes to be duplicated in a
gamete, which can cause three copies of a chromosome (triploidy) in offspring.
Incorrect numbers of chromosomes often lead to sterility and in plants can
cause increased vigor due to polyploidy.
Bacteria
Bacteria, common pathogens, are prokaryotes that come in many shapes and sizes. They can infect many things,
and sometimes they cause harm and sometimes they do not. You may have heard of “gut bacteria” before; this is a
special colony of bacteria that lives inside each on
