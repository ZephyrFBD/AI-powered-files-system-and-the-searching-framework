ig. 25–14a, 17 cm in front of the eye. We can
use the thin lens equation to find the focal length of the lens, and from this its
lens power. The new near point (as shown in Fig. 25–14b) can be calculated for
the lens by again using the thin lens equation.
SOLUTION (a) For an object at infinity 
the image must be in front
of the lens 17 cm from the eye or
from the lens; hence
We use the thin lens equation to solve for the focal length of the
needed lens:
So
or
The minus sign indicates
that it must be a diverging lens for the myopic eye.
(b) The near point when glasses are worn is where an object is placed 
so
that the lens forms an image at the “near point of the naked eye,” namely 12 cm
from the eye. That image point is
in front of the lens,
so
and the thin lens equation gives
So 
which means the near point when the person is wearing glasses
is 30 cm in front of the lens, or 32 cm from the eye.
Contact Lenses
Suppose contact lenses are used to correct the eye in Example 25–6. Since
