 agents, including common drugs like
acetaminophen, can exhibit toxic eﬀects at suﬀiciently high doses, while
at lower doses they may be harmless or even therapeutically useful.
Which of the following best characterizes why most drugs exert toxic
eﬀects at suﬀiciently high dosages?
Artificial substances are inherently toxic, so high enough doses of
any such substance will result in negative eﬀects.
(A)
At suﬀiciently high doses the metabolic processing of most drugs
changes, thereby creating toxic metabolites that are not present at
lower doses.
(B)
Most drugs interfere with normal biological functioning, and higher
doses can cause an excessive degree of interference that manifests
as toxicity.
(C)
Even pharmaceutically pure drugs contain trace amounts of
impurities, and at high doses these impurities are present in
suﬀiciently great quantities to cause toxic side eﬀects.
(D)
