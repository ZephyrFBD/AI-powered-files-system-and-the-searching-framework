relative humidity is thus
21.0 torr
31.8 torr * 100% = 66%.
EXAMPLE 13;17
Humans are sensitive to humidity. A relative humidity of 40–50% is generally
optimum for both health and comfort. High humidity, particularly on a hot day,
reduces the evaporation of moisture from the skin, which is one of the body’s
vital mechanisms for regulating body temperature. Very low humidity, on the other
hand, can dry the skin and mucous membranes.
Air is saturated with water vapor when the partial pressure of water in the air
is equal to the saturated vapor pressure at that temperature. If the partial pressure
of water exceeds the saturated vapor pressure, the air is said to be supersaturated.
This situation can occur when a temperature decrease occurs. For example,
suppose the temperature is 30°C and the partial pressure of water is 21 torr, which
represents a humidity of 66% as we saw in Example 13–17. Suppose now that the
temperature falls to, say, 20°C, as might happen at nightfall. From Table 13–3
