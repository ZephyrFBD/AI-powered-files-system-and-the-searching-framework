adioactive 
decays in the dying moments of such a 
star are responsible for the presence of all 
elements heavier than iron and nickel.
Without these dramatic super-
nova events in the past history of the 
universe, heavier elements that are 
so familiar to us, such as silver, gold, 
iodine, lead, and uranium, would not 
exist.
