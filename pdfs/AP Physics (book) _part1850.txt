l a force and would move. Indeed
the entire volume of a conductor must be entirely at the same potential in the static case.
The surface of a conductor is thus an equipotential surface. (If it weren’t, the free
electrons at the surface would move, because whenever there is a potential difference
between two points, free charges will move.) This is fully consistent with our result in
Section 16–9 that the electric field at the surface of a conductor must be perpendicular
to the surface.
