Ossification is distinct from the process
of calcification; whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones, it can also occur in other tissues.
Ossification begins approximately six weeks after fertilization in an embryo. Before this time, the embryonic skeleton

consists entirely of fibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage. The development of bone from fibrous membranes is
called intramembranous ossification; development from hyaline cartilage is called endochondral ossification. Bone growth
continues until approximately age 25. Bones can grow in thickness throughout life, but after age 25, ossification functions
primarily in bone remodeling and repair.
Intramembranous Ossification
Intramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes. It is involved in the formation
of the flat bones of the skull, the mandible, and the clavicles. Ossification begins as mesenchymal cells form a template
