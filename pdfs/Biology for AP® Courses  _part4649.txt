trophic soil bacteria, grass, deer, beetles, and a lion. Create a
mini-poster to describe the trophic structure of the ecosystem, how each organism receives inputs of energy
and nutrients, where outputs (e.g., wastes) go, and the effect(s) each organisms has on the others. Include
all energy transformations and transfers based on the hypothetical assumption that 9,500 J of net energy is
available at the producer level.

37.3 | Biogeochemical Cycles
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are the basic stages in the biogeochemical cycles of water, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur?
•
How have human activities impacted these biogeochemical cycles, and what are the potential consequences for
Earth?
Connection for AP® Courses
As we learned in Energy Flow through Ecosystems, energy takes a one-way path (flows directionally) through the trophic
levels in an ecosystem. However, the matter that comprises living organisms is conserved and rec
