 more than one-half of all human tumor cells. This discovery is not surprising in
light of the multiple roles that the p53 protein plays at the G1 checkpoint. A cell with a faulty p53 may fail to detect errors
present in the genomic DNA (Figure 10.15). Even if a partially functional p53 does identify the mutations, it may no longer
be able to signal the necessary DNA repair enzymes. Either way, damaged DNA will remain uncorrected. At this point, a
functional p53 will deem the cell unsalvageable and trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis). The damaged version of
p53 found in cancer cells, however, cannot trigger apoptosis.

Figure 10.15 The role of normal p53 is to monitor DNA and the supply of oxygen (hypoxia is a condition of reduced
oxygen supply). If damage is detected, p53 triggers repair mechanisms. If repairs are unsuccessful, p53 signals
apoptosis. A cell with an a
