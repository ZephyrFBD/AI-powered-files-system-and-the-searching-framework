animals. The effects of El Ni√±o stretch globally, increasing or decreasing rainfall from Peru to
Australia, Indonesia, and the southwestern United States.
2. Meteor impacts and large volcanic eruptions have historically triggered global changes in atmospheric
conditions. Both increase the amount of particulate matter in the atmosphere, reducing the amount of solar radiation
reaching the surface of the earth. A decrease in primary production follows, and that initiates a bottom-up effect that
devastates
the ecosystem. Volcanic eruptions also release CO2 into the atmosphere,
warming the global climate.
The last mass extinction occurred about 65 million years ago (mya), at the boundary of the Cretaceous and Tertiary
geologic
periods (the K-T boundary). It may have been caused by an asteroid impact or a volcanic eruption. About 75% of all
species became extinct, including the (non-bird) dinosaurs.
A mass extinction occurred about 200 mya at the boundary of the Triassic and Jurassic geologi
