that is required, the chemical equation needs to be balanced.
To construct a balanced chemical equation we start by writing the formulas for the 
reactants on the left-hand side of the arrow and the products on the right-hand side. 
Next we balance the equation by determining the coefficients that provide equal num-
bers of each type of atom on both sides of the equation. For most purposes, a balanced 
equation should contain the smallest possible whole-number coefficients.
In balancing an equation, you need to understand the difference between 
 
coefficients and subscripts. As Figure 3.3 illustrates, changing a subscript in a  
formula—
from H2O to H2O2, for example—changes the identity of the substance. The substance 
H2O2, hydrogen peroxide, is quite different from the substance H2O, water. Never change 
subscripts when balancing an equation. In contrast, placing a coefficient in front of a for-
mula changes only the amount of the substance and not its identity. Thus, 2 H2O means
