The atomic theory of matter postulates that all matter is made
up of tiny entities called atoms, which are typically 
in
diameter.
Atomic and molecular masses are specified on a scale
where the most common form of carbon 
is arbitrarily
given the value 12.0000 u (atomic mass units), exactly.
The distinction between solids, liquids, and gases can be
attributed to the strength of the attractive forces between the
atoms or molecules and to their average speed.
Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold something 
is. Thermometers are used to measure temperature on the
Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K) scales. Two stan-
dard points on each scale are the freezing point of water (0°C,
32°F, 273.15 K) and the boiling point of water (100°C, 212°F,
373.15 K). A one-kelvin change in temperature equals a change
of one Celsius degree or
