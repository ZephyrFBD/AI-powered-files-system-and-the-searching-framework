) An object is located 1.50 m from a 6.5-D lens. By how
much does the image move if the object is moved (a) 0.90 m
closer to the lens, and (b) 0.90 m farther from the lens?
51. (II) (a) How far from a 50.0-mm-focal-length lens must an
object be placed if its image is to be magnified 
and
be real? (b) What if the image is to be virtual and magni-
fied
52. (II) Repeat Problem 51 for a
lens.
[Hint: Consider objects real or virtual (formed by some
other piece of optics).]
53. (II) How far from a converging lens with a focal length of
32 cm should an object be placed to produce a real image
which is the same size as the object?
54. (II) (a) A 2.40-cm-high insect is 1.30 m from a 135-mm-
focal-length lens. Where is the image, how high is it, and
what type is it? (b) What if
55. (III) A bright object and a viewing screen are separated by
a distance of 86.0 cm. At what location(s) between the
object and the screen should a lens of focal length 16.0 cm
be placed in order to produce a sharp imag
