CHAPTER 31
Nuclear Energy; Effects and Uses of Radiation
30. (II) Verify the Q-value stated for each of the reactions of
Eqs. 31–6. [Hint: Use Appendix B; be careful with electrons
(included in mass values except for p, d, t).]
31. (II) (a) Calculate the energy release per gram of fuel for the
reactions of Eqs. 31–8a, b, and c. (b) Calculate the energy
release per gram of uranium 
in fission, and give its
ratio to each reaction in (a).
32. (II) How much energy is released when 
absorbs a
slow neutron 
and becomes 
33. (II) If a typical house requires 960 W of electric power on
average, what minimum amount of deuterium fuel would
have to be used in a year to supply these electrical needs?
Assume the reaction of Eq. 31–8b.
34. (II) If 
is struck by a slow neutron, it can form 
and
another nucleus. (a) What is the second nucleus? (This is a
method of generating this isotope.) (b) How much energy
is released in the process?
35. (II) Suppose a fusion reactor ran on “d–
