at does not contribute to the creation of ice floes, so choice (B) is incorrect.
Choice (C) is incorrect because capillary action describes water’s ability to climb up narrow tubes.
9. (C) Capillary action describes water’s ability to climb up narrow tubes. The trunks of redwood trees contain
many narrow tubes made of xylem cells, which allow water to travel from the roots to the rest of the tree.
Choice (A) is incorrect because surface tension describes the attraction between molecules of water at the
surface of a liquid. Specific heat is not involved in capillary action, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (D) is
incorrect because the density of ice has nothing to do with water’s ability to move upward from the roots to the
rest of the tree.
10. (B) Due to water’s high specific heat, more energy is required to evaporate water molecules than other liquids.
Sweat on the skin absorbs heat from the body as it evaporates, lowering body temperature. Choice (A) is
incorrect because surface t
