Based on the data from the experiment and the prediction of an increase in 
average surface temperature by the model, predict how the locations of plant 
species are expected to change over time.

will move toward the poles.
• As temperatures warm, the ranges where individual plant species are found
will move toward higher altitudes.
• As temperatures warm, the ranges where individual plant species are found
will move toward cooler areas.
