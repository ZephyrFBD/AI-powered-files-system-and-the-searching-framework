23. Scientists are interested in determining the evolution of seven lizard species found on different islands of the 
Canary Island group. They isolated DNA from individuals of each species and sequenced the mitochondrial 
gene that encodes cytochrome b. The numbers of genetic differences between species are shown in the table 
below. 
Based on the data in the table, which of the following lizard species are most closely related? 
(A) Species C and species B 
(B) Species E and species D 
(C) Species F and spe
