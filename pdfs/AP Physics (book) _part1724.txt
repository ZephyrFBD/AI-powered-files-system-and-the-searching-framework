sphere quickly becomes
charged. If, instead, we had connected the two spheres by a wooden rod or a piece
of rubber (Fig. 16â€“5c), the uncharged ball would not become noticeably charged.
Materials like the iron nail are said to be conductors of electricity, whereas wood
and rubber are nonconductors or insulators.
Metals are generally good conductors, whereas most other materials are
insulators (although even insulators conduct electricity very slightly). Nearly all
natural materials fall into one or the other of these two distinct categories.
However, a few materials (notably silicon and germanium) fall into an intermediate
category known as semiconductors.
From the atomic point of view, the electrons in an insulating material are
bound very tightly to the nuclei. In a good metal conductor, on the other hand,
some of the electrons are bound very loosely and can move about freely within the
metal (although they cannot leave the metal easily) and are often referred to as
free electrons or
