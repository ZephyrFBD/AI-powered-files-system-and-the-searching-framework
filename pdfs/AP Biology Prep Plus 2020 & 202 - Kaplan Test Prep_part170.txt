ractionated and analyzed for radioactive carbon content in
phosphoglyceric acid (PGA), a 3-carbon sugar, which is an early
product of carbon fixation. The results are plotted in a graph that
shows the content of radioactive PGA as a function of time of
exposure to radioactive carbon.
Aȇer analyzing the graphs, the scientist can reasonably conclude
that

The neurotransmitter acetylcholine has been shown to be an important
target for a large number of synthetically produced drugs, in addition to
numerous venoms and toxins produced by plants, animals, and bacteria,
which interfere with acetylcholine release or reuptake.
