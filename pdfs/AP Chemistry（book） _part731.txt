ut any intervention. That can 
be the case, but often some energy must be imparted 
to get the process started. Just as it is spontaneous 
for a rock to roll down the side of a hill once started, 
so too can it be spontaneous for chemical reactions 
to proceed once enough energy is imparted to initi-
ate the reaction (Figure 5.16). The enthalpy change 
in a reaction gives one indication as to whether 
the reaction is likely to be spontaneous. The com-
bustion of H21g2 and O21g2, for example, is highly 
exothermic:
H21g2 + 1
2  O21g2 ¡  H2O1g2    ∆H = -242 kJ

temperatures below 0 °C. Thus, we know that ice at room tempera-
ture melts and water put into a freezer at -20 °C turns into ice. Both 
processes are spontaneous under different conditions even though 
they are the reverse of one another. In Chapter 19, we will address the 
spontaneity of processes more fully. We will see why a process can be 
spontaneous at one temperature but not at anothe
