m ATPase continually moves Na+ back out of the cell and K+
back into the cell, and the K+ leaks out leaving negative charge behind. Very quickly, the membrane repolarizes, so that it
can again be depolarized.

Control of Muscle Tension
Neural control initiates the formation of actinâ€“myosin cross-bridges, leading to the sarcomere shortening involved in muscle
contraction. These contractions extend from the muscle fiber through connective tissue to pull on bones, causing skeletal
movement. The pull exerted by a muscle is called tension, and the amount of force created by this tension can vary. This
enables the same muscles to move very light objects and very heavy objects. In individual muscle fibers, the amount of
tension produced depends on the cross-sectional area of the muscle fiber and the frequency of neural stimulation.
The number of cross-bridges formed betw
