nerate, but not ambiguous
nucleotides following the initiation site in the direction of mRNA transcription; in general, sequences that
are toward the 3' end relative to a site on the mRNA
sequence present in protein-coding mRNA after completion of pre-mRNA splicing
complex that “facilitates chromatin transcription” by disassembling nucleosomes ahead of a transcribing RNA
polymerase II and reassembling them after the polymerase passes by
(GGCG) nonessential eukaryotic promoter sequence that binds cellular factors to increase the efficiency of
transcription; may be present several times in a promoter
structure of RNA when it folds back on itself and forms intramolecular hydrogen bonds between complementary
nucleotides
prokaryotic RNA polymerase consisting of α, α, β, β', and σ; this complex is responsible for transcription
initiation
nucleotide from which mRNA synthesis proceeds in the 5' to 3' direction; denoted with a “+1”
in prokaryotes, called tRNA f
Met ; in eukaryotes, called tRNAi
