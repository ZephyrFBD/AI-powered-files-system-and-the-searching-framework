(C) The death of all the yellow-leaved seedlings 
(D) The existence of yellow-leaved seedlings

(A) yellow-leaved seedlings were unable to 
absorb water from the paper towels 
(B) taller green-leaved seedlings blocked the light 
and prevented photosynthesis 
(C) yellow-leaved seedlings were unable to 
convert light energy to chemical energy 
(D) a higher rate of respiration in yellow-leaved 
seedlings depleted their stored nutrients
