s 0–15 were deleted, what would be the likely consequence?
(A) No transcription would be allowed to occur.
(B) No translation would be allowed to occur.
(C) Neither transcription nor translation would occur.
(D) No consequence would occur as these bases are non-coding.
33. A transcript was identified in the nucleus that is similar to this transcript. How is it likely different from the
mRNA transcript?
(A) The nuclear transcript likely contained introns.
(B) The nuclear transcript likely contained exons.
(C) The nuclear transcript likely contained a poly-A tail.
(D) The nuclear transcript likely contained a 3’ GTP-Cap.
34. RNA polymerase transcribes DNA into mRNA by matching base pairs of nucleotides. Which of the following
