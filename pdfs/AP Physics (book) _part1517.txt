 part (b) of Example 14–2 that water requires almost 10 times as
much heat as an equal mass of iron to make the same temperature change. Water
has one of the highest specific heats of all substances, which makes it an ideal
substance for hot-water space-heating systems and other uses that require a min-
imal drop in temperature for a given amount of heat transfer. It is the water
content, too, that causes the apples rather than the crust in hot apple pie to burn
our tongues, through heat transfer.

CHAPTER 14
Heat
A very hot frying pan. You accidentally
let an empty iron frying pan get very hot on the stove (200°C or even more).
What happens when you dunk it into a few inches of cool water in the bottom
of the sink? Will the final temperature be midway between the initial temperatures
of the water and pan? Will the water start boiling? Assume the mass of water is
roughly the same as the mass of the frying
