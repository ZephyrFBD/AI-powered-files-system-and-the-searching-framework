iation, is far more harmful to biological systems than radiation that does not cause 
ionization. The latter, called nonionizing radiation, is generally of lower energy, such 
as radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation 
 (Section 6.7) or slow-moving neutrons.
Most living tissue contains at least 70% water by mass. When living tissue is irra-
diated, water molecules absorb most of the energy of the radiation. Thus, it is com-
mon to define ionizing radiation as radiation that can ionize water, a process requiring 
a minimum energy of 1216 kJ/mol. Alpha, beta, and gamma rays (as well as X rays and 
higher-energy ultraviolet radiation) possess energies in excess of this quantity and are 
therefore forms of ionizing radiation.
When ionizing radiation passes through living tissue, electrons are removed from 
water molecules, forming highly reactive H2O+ ions. An H2O+ ion can react with another 
water molecule to form an H3O+ ion and a neutral OH molecule:
 
H2O+ + H2O ยก H3O+ + OH
