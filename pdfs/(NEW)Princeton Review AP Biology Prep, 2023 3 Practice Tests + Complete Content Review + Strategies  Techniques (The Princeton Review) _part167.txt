her and interact with each other more
tightly; thus saturated fats tend to form solids at room temperature (an example is butter). When molecules are
kinked, they cannot pack as tightly and tend to be liquid at room temperature (an example is an oil).
One exception to this rule is an unsaturated fatty acid with a trans-double bond, as below:
With this trans-double bond, the unsaturated lipid is relatively linear, as would be expected in a saturated fat. Due to
the relative linearity, they are more likely than unsaturated lipids with cis-double bonds to be a solid at room
temperature.
Phospholipids
Another special class of lipids is known as phospholipids. Phospholipids contain two fatty acid “tails” and one
negatively charged phosphate “head.” Take a look at a typical phospholipid.
Phospholipids are extremely important, mainly because of some unique properties they possess, particularly with
regard to water.
The two fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (“water-hating”). In other words, jus
