 membrane of a target cell and adhere to intracellular receptors residing in the cytoplasm
or in the nucleus. The cell signaling pathways induced by the steroid hormones regulate specific genes on the cell's DNA.
The hormones and receptor complex act as transcription regulators by increasing or decreasing the synthesis of mRNA
molecules of specific genes. This, in turn, determines the amount of corresponding protein that is synthesized by altering
gene expression. This protein can be used either to change the structure of the cell or to produce enzymes that catalyze
chemical reactions. In this way, the steroid hormone regulates specific cell processes as illustrated in Figure 28.5.
Figure 28.5 An intracellular nuclear receptor (NR) is located in the cytoplasm bound to a heat shock protein
(HSP). Upon hormone binding, the receptor dissociates from the heat shock protein and translocates to the
nucleus. In the nucleus, the hormone-receptor complex binds to a DNA sequence called a hormone
