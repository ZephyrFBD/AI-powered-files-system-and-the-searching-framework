metabolic activities that direct or influence the expression of its genes.
Signals from the external environment come from biological sources, such as chemicals from a pathogen or a bee
sting, or from physical sources, such as light or heat. Within a multicellular organism, cells also receive signals from
other cells. This can happen in several ways, depending upon how far the signal needs to travel:
1. Direct contact between animal cells allows proteins, carbohydrates,
and lipids of the plasma membranes to transmit information. This kind of communication is common among cells
during early development. Information is also transmitted through two kinds of communication junctions:
Gap junctions in animal cells allow for chemical and electrical signaling between cells. Ions and small molecules
can pass through gap junctions, but larger molecules, like proteins and nucleic acids, cannot.
Plasmodesmata in plant cells are tunnels of cytoplasm between cells. They provide passageways acro
