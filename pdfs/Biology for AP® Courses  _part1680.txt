 a large 60S subunit,
for a total of 80S. The small subunit is responsible for binding the mRNA template, whereas the large subunit sequentially
binds tRNAs. Each mRNA molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in the same
direction: reading the mRNA from 5' to 3' and synthesizing the polypeptide from the N terminus to the C terminus. The
complete mRNA/poly-ribosome structure is called a polysome.
tRNAs
The tRNAs are structural RNA molecules that were transcribed from genes by RNA polymerase III. Depending on the
species, 40 to 60 types of tRNAs exist in the cytoplasm. Serving as adaptors, specific tRNAs bind to sequences on the
mRNA template and add the corresponding amino acid to the polypeptide chain. Therefore, tRNAs are the molecules that
actually “translate” the language of RNA into the language of proteins.
Of the 64 possible mRNA codons—or triplet combinations of A, U, G, and C—three specify the termination of protein
synthesis and 61 spec
