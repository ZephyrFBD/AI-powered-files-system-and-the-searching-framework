ittle is known about the fossil. It appears to be a new species. Upon careful examination 
of the fossil, small amounts of soft tissue have been discovered. Normally, soft tissue 
does not survive fossilization; however, rare situations of such preservation do occur. 
Scientists were able to extract DNA nucleotides from the tissue and use the information 
to sequence several genes. Your task is to use BLAST to analyze these genes and 
determine the most likely placement of the fossil species on Figure 4.
