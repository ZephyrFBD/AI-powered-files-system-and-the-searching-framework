hich is the limiting reac-
tant? (c) How many grams of C2H2, O2, CO2, and H2O are 
present after the reaction is complete?
 3.87 Write the balanced chemical equations for (a) the com-
plete combustion of acetic acid 1CH3COOH2, the main 
 
ingredient in vinegar; (b) the decomposition of solid 
 
calcium hydroxide into solid calcium oxide (lime) and 
water vapor; (c) the combination reaction between nickel 
metal and chlorine gas.
 
3.88 If 1.5 mol C2H5OH, 1.5 mol C3H8, and 1.5 mol CH3CH2COCH3 
are completely combusted in oxygen, which produces the 
largest number of moles of H2O? Which produces the least? 
Explain.
 3.89 The effectiveness of nitrogen fertilizers depends on both 
their ability to deliver nitrogen to plants and the amount of 
nitrogen they can deliver. Four common nitrogen-containing 
fertilizers are ammonia, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sul-
fate, and urea 31NH222CO4. Rank these fertilizers in terms of 
the mass percentage nitrogen they contain.
