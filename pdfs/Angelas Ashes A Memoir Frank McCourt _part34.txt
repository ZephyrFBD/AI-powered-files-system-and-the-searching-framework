inging on the radio, Brother, can you spare a dime? 
 
 Malachy and I play with the twins.We know Mam won’t sing Anyone 
 
 can see why I wanted your kiss. She sits at the kitchen table talking 
 
 to herself,What am I going to do? till it’s late and Dad rolls up the stairs 
 
 singing Roddy McCorley. He pushes in the door and calls for us,Where 
 
 are my troops? Where are my four warriors? 
 
 Mam says, Leave those boys alone.They’re gone to bed half hungry 
 
 because you have to fill your belly with whiskey. 
 
 He comes to the bedroom door. Up, boys, up. A nickel for everyone 
 
 who promises to die for Ireland. 
 
 Deep in Canadian woods we met 
 
 From one bright island flown. 
 
 Great is the land we tread, but yet 
 
 Our hearts are with our own. 
 
 Up, boys, up. Francis, Malachy, Oliver, Eugene. The Red Branch 
 
 Knights, the Fenian Men, the IRA. Up, up. 
 
 Mam is at the kitchen table, shaking, her hair hanging damp, her 
 
 face wet. Can’t you leave them alone? she says.
