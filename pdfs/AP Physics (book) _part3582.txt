 in general. If there were pockets of antimatter in the universe,
a huge explosion would occur if it should encounter normal matter. It is believed
that antimatter was prevalent in the very early universe (Section 33–7).
Negative Sea of Electrons; Vacuum State
The original idea for antiparticles came from a relativistic wave equation devel-
oped in 1928 by the Englishman P. A. M. Dirac (1902–1984). Recall that, as we
saw in Chapter 26, the total energy E of a particle with mass m and momentum p
and zero potential energy is given by Eq. 26–9,
Thus
Dirac applied his new equation and found that it included solutions with both 
and 
signs. He could not ignore the solution with the negative sign, which we
might have thought unphysical. If those negative energy states are real, then we
would expect normal free electrons to drop down into those states, emitting
