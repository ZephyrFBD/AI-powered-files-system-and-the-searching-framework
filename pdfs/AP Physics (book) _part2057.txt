rupted. Compare to a series circuit, where if
one device (say,
in Fig.19–3a) is disconnected, the current is stopped to all others.
In a parallel circuit, Fig. 19–4a, the total current I that leaves the battery
splits into three separate paths. We let 
and 
be the currents through each
of the resistors,
and 
respectively. Because electric charge is conserved,
the current I flowing into junction A (where the different wires or conductors
meet, Fig. 19–4a) must equal the current flowing out of the junction. Thus
[parallel]
When resistors are connected in parallel, each has the same voltage across it.
(Indeed, any two points in a circuit connected by a wire of negligible resistance
are at the same potential.) Hence the full voltage of the battery is applied to each
resistor in Fig. 19–4a. Applying Ohm’s law to each resistor, we have
Let us now determine what single resistor 
(Fig. 19–4c) will draw the same
