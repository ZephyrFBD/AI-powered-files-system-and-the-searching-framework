f the
mirror, and how high must its lower edge be above the floor, if she is to be able
to see her whole body? Assume that her eyes are 10 cm below the top of her
head.
APPROACH For her to see her whole body, light rays from the top of her head
(point G) and from the bottom of her foot (A) must reflect from the mirror and
enter her eye, Fig. 23–8. We don’t show two rays diverging from each point as we
did in Fig. 23–7, where we wanted to find where the image is. Now that we know
the image is the same distance behind a plane mirror as the object is in front, we
only need to show one ray leaving point G (top of head) and one ray leaving
point A (her toe), and then use geometry.
SOLUTION First consider the ray that leaves her foot at A, reflects at B, and
enters the eye at E. The mirror needs to extend no lower than B. The angle of
reflection equals the angle of incidence, so the height BD is half of the height AE.
