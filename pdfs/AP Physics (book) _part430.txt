 it? [Hint: See Example 4–15.]
32. (II) Figure 4–53 shows a block (mass 
) on a smooth hori-
zontal surface, connected by a thin cord that passes over 
a pulley to a second block 
which hangs vertically.
(a) Draw a free-body diagram for each block, showing the
force of gravity on each, the force (tension) exerted by the
cord, and any normal force. (b) Apply Newton’s second law
to find formulas for the acceleration of the system and for
the tension in the cord. Ignore friction and the masses of
the pulley and cord.
