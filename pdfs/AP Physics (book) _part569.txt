This baseball pitcher is about to accelerate the 
baseball to a high velocity by exerting a force on it.
He will be doing work on the ball as he exerts the 
force over a displacement of perhaps several meters,
from behind his head until he releases the ball with 
arm outstretched in front of him. The total work done 
on the ball will be equal to the kinetic energy 
acquired by the ball, a result known as the 
work-energy principle.
