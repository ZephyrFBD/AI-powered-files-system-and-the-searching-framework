rms a linear molecule that is symmetrical or balanced and therefore
nonpolar. It looks like this: O=C=O. H2O is asymmetrical and a highly
polar molecule. See Figure 2.1.
HYDROPHOBIC AND HYDROPHILIC SUBSTANCES
Hydrophilic means “water loving.” Substances that are polar such as
hydrochloric acid (HCl), or that carry a charge like the hydronium ion

(H3O+), or that are ionic like table salt (NaCl) will dissolve in water. Since
so many substances dissolve in water, water is known as the “universal
solvent.”
Hydrophobic means “water hating” and applies to nonpolar substances,
which are miscible with or will dissolve in lipids. Salad dressing separates
upon standing because oil (hydrophobic) and vinegar (hydrophilic, acetic
acid solution in water) are not miscible.
Since the plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer, only nonpolar
substances can readily dissolve through the plasma membrane. Large polar
molecules must travel across a membrane in spe
