Vertebrate Diversity in Blood Circulation
Blood circulation has evolved differently in vertebrates and may show variation in different animals for the
required amount of pressure, organ and vessel location, and organ size. Animals with longs necks and those
that live in cold environments have distinct blood pressure adaptations.
Long necked animals, such as giraffes, need to pump blood upward from the heart against gravity. The
blood pressure required from the pumping of the left ventricle would be equivalent to 250 mm Hg (mm Hg
= millimeters of mercury, a unit of pressure) to reach the height of a giraffe’s head, which is 2.5 meters
higher than the heart. However, if checks and balances were not in place, this blood pressure would damage
the giraffe’s br
