sible outcomes minus one. 
 
Mode = value that occurs most frequently in a data set 
 
Median = middle value that separates the greater and lesser halves of a data set 
 
Mean = sum of all data points divided by number of data points 
 
Range = value obtained by subtracting the smallest observation (sample minimum) from the greatest (sample maximum)
