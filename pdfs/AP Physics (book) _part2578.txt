 we can see that, when an object is placed between a
converging lens and its focal point, the image is virtual.

FIGURE 23–43 An object placed
within the focal point of a
converging lens produces a virtual
image. Example 23–13.
Diverging lens. Where must a small insect be placed if a
25-cm-focal-length diverging lens is to form a virtual image 20 cm from the lens,
on the same side as the object?
APPROACH The ray diagram is basically that of Fig.23–41 because our lens here
is diverging and our image is given as in front of the lens within the focal distance.
(It would be a valuable exercise to draw the ray diagram to scale, precisely, now.)
The insect’s distance,
can be calculated using the thin lens equation.
SOLUTION The lens is diverging, so f is nega
