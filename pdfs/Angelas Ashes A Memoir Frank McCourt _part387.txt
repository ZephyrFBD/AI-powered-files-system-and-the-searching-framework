 taken away to be put down.You 
 
  
  
 can bite postmen and milkmen all you like but the case of the passing 
 
 nun goes all the way to the bishop and he takes steps especially if the 
 
 owner of the dog is a known Buddhist and a danger to good Catholics 
 
 around him. Mr.Timoney was told this and cried and laughed so hard 
 
 the doctor came and said he was gone beyond recall so they carted 
 
 him off to the City Home, where they keep old people who are helpless 
 
 or demented. 
 
 That’s the end of my Saturday sixpence but I’ll read to Mr.Timoney 
 
 money or no money. I wait down the street till the woman next 
 
 178 
 
 door goes in, I climb in Mr.Timoney’s window for Gulliver’s Travels and 
 
 walk miles to the City Home so that he won’t miss his reading.The man 
 
 at the gate says,What? You want to come in an’ read to an oul’ man? Is 
 
 it coddin’ me you are? Get outa here before I call the guards. 
 
 Could I leave the book for someone else to read to Mr.Timoney?
