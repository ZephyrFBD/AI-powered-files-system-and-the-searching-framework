the sprout to dry mass and multiply by 4.35 kcal/g. Use the 
estimated percentage of biomass (dry mass) in fresh Fast Plants calculated in estimating 
the Fast Plantsâ€™ net primary productivity (NPP), Step 5 on page S130, to estimate the 
biomass of each brussels sprout. 
Step 5 These procedures are similar to an energy audit. Because energy is neither created 
nor destroyed, you must account for all energy in the system. (That is why you need to 
determine frass mass.) Combine your two earlier energy flow diagrams into one, and 
now include all the information that you measured. For those energy pathways that 
you did not explicitly measure, provide an estimated energy quantity. For instance, the 
amount of light energy in the system is more difficult to estimate. What other parts of 
the energy flow diagram could you not actually measure? 
Step 6 Graph your results. For the plants and for the butterfly larvae, design and 
construct appropriate graphs of your results. Enter sketches of
