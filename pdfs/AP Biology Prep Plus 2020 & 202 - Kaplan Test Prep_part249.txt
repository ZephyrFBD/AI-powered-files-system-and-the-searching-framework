face area. A moist
surface that lines the photosynthetic cells in the spongy layer is
necessary for diﬀusion of gases into and out of cells. Air spaces in leaves
increase the surface area available for gas diﬀusion by the cells. The size
of stomata is controlled by guard cells that can open and close the
opening. These cells open during the day to admit CO2 for photosynthesis
and close at night to limit the loss of water vapor through transpiration,
the evaporation of water from leaves that draws water up through the
plant’s vascular tissues from the soil. The upper surface layer of cells in
leaves has no openings, an adaptation that reduces water loss from the
leaf.
Guard cells are kidney-shaped cells in dicots and dumbbell-shaped cells
in monocots that change their shape according to the amount of water
that exists within them. This water exerts a pressure called turgor
pressure. When water is abundant, the guard cells swell, and when water
is sparse, they clamp down and shut the sto
