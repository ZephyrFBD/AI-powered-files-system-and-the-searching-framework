3.105] A lithium salt used in lubricating grease has the formula 
LiCnH2n + 1O2. The salt is soluble in water to the extent of 
0.036 g per 100 g of water at 25 °C. The osmotic pressure of 
this solution is found to be 57.1 torr. Assuming that molal-
ity and molarity in such a dilute solution are the same and 
that the lithium salt is completely dissociated in the solu-
tion, determine an appropriate value of n in the formula 
for the salt.

13.106  Fluorocarbons (compounds that contain both carbon 
and fluorine) were, until recently, used as refrigerants. 
The compounds listed in the following table are all gases 
at 25 °C, and their solubilities in water at 25 °C and 1 
atm fluorocarbon pressure are given as mass percentages. 
 
(a) For each fluorocarbon, calculate the molality of a sat-
urated solution. (b) Which molecular property best pre-
dicts the solubility of these gases in water: molar mass, 
dipole moment, or ability to hydrogen-bond to water?
