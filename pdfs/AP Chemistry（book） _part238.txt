Gold can be hammered into extremely thin sheets called 
gold leaf. An architect wants to cover a 100 ft * 82 ft ceiling 
with gold leaf that is five-millionths of an inch thick. The 
density of gold is 19.32 g>cm3, and gold costs $1654 per troy 
ounce 11 troy ounce = 31.1034768 g2. How much will it 
cost the architect to buy the necessary gold?
 1.64  A copper refinery produces a copper ingot weighing 150 lb. 
If the copper is drawn into wire whose diameter is 7.50 mm, 
how many feet of copper can be obtained from the ingot? 
The density of copper is 8.94 g>cm3. (Assume that the wire is 
a cylinder whose volume V = pr2h, where r is its radius and h 
is its height or length.)
