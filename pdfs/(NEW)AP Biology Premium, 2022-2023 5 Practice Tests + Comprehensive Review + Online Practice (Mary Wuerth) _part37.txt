ey are included on the AP Biology Equations and Formulas
sheet, which will be supplied to you on test day. For quick reference, you can review those formulas in the Appendix of this book.
1. Calculate the chi-square value. The formula for chi-square is:
The symbol ∑ means “summation.” This means you need to do this calculation for each category of data
(brand A and brand B) and then add the values.
Using the observed and expected values (45 observed and 50 expected for brand A; 55 observed and 50
expected for brand B):
2. Determine the number of degrees of freedom (df) in the experiment. The number of degrees of freedom in
an experiment is defined as the number of possible outcomes in the experiment minus 1. In this experiment,
there are two possible outcomes, brand A or brand B, so the df is 2 – 1 = 1.
3. Using the degrees of freedom and the p-value, find the critical value in the chi-square table. The p-value is
defined as the probability that the observed data would be produced by r
