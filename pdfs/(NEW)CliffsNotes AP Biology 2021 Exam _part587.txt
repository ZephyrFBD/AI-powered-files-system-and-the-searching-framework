zes the effect of the concentration gradients in the
nephron.
9. B. CO2 enters erythrocytes (red blood cells), where it is converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3) by the enzyme
carbonic anhydrase. H2CO3 then
 
dissociates into H+ and HCO3âˆ’ and diffuses back into the plasma.
10. A. Gas exchange occurs across the moist membranes of alveoli, small air sacs in the lungs.
11. D. The pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs, where it is oxygenated for
transport back to the heart and throughout the body.
12. C. The contraction of the left ventricle pumps blood through the body, and, thus, maintains systolic blood
pressure. When the left ventricle relaxes, diastolic blood pressure is maintained by the semilunar valve in the aorta
by preventing blood movement back into the ventricle.
13. D. Double capillary beds (called portal systems) occur in the glomerulus and the capillaries that surround the
loop of Henle (both in the kidneys), the small intestine and liver, and t
