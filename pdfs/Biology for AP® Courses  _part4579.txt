ons of the butterfly.
b.
Comparison of the number of birds attacking
butterflies with and without eyespots suggests
that the presence of an eyespot makes butterflies
more visible to predators resulting in selection
against the trait.
c.
Comparison of the number of birds fleeing from
butterflies with and without eyespots indicates
that the eyespot trait has been disfavored
because this trait makes the butterflies stand out
to predators.
d.
Comparison of the number of birds fleeing from
butterflies with and without eyespots suggests
that selection has occurred in butterflies in favor
of the eyespot trait, which mimics a predator of
the bird.

Biologists analyzed the sound frequencies of different calls
made by a small bird species that serve as prey for a much
larger predator bird species. The small bird makes three
different kinds of calls: a mobbing call that a group of
adults make when mobbing a single predator bird in
defense of their
