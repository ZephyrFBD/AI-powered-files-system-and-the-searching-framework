▶ Figure 5.14 Exothermic reaction of 
hydrogen with oxygen. When a mixture of 
H21g2 and O21g2 is ignited to form H2O1g2, 
the resultant explosion produces a ball of 
flame. Because the system releases heat to 
the surroundings, the reaction is exothermic 
as indicated in the enthalpy diagram.

The following guidelines are helpful when using thermochemical equations and 
enthalpy diagrams:
1. Enthalpy is an extensive property. The magnitude of ∆H is proportional to 
the amount of reactant consumed in
