l the proctor tells you to do so.
Note that each question has an associated suggested time. The number of pages available
for each response should also be considered a guide as to how long each response should
be. Each answer should be in organized, well-balanced, and comprehensive prose form;
outline form is not acceptable. Do not spend time restating the questions or providing
more than the number of examples called for. For instance, if a question calls for two
examples, you can earn credit only for the first two examples you provide. Diagrams may
be used to supplement discussion, but diagrams alone will not suffice, unless required by
the question. Write clearly and legibly. Begin each answer following the appropriate
question. Do not skip lines. Cross out any errors you make; crossed-out work will not be
scored.
Manage your time carefully. You may proceed freely from one question to the next. You
may review your responses if you finish before the end of the exam is announced.
