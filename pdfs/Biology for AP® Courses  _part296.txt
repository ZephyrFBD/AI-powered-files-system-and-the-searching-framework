 fats in the human diet may lead to an increase in levels of low-density lipoproteins
(LDL), or “bad” cholesterol, which in turn may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries, resulting in heart disease. Many
fast food restaurants have recently banned the use of trans fats, and food labels are required to display the trans fat content.
Omega Fatty Acids
Essential fatty acids are fatty acids required but not synthesized by the human body. Consequently, they have to be
supplemented through ingestion via the diet. Omega-3 fatty acids (like that shown in Figure 3.18) fall into this category
and are one of only two known for humans (the other being omega-6 fatty acid). These are polyunsaturated fatty acids and
are called omega-3 because the third carbon from the end of the hydrocarbon chain is connected to its neighboring carbon
by a double bond.
