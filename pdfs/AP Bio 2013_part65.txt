The incidence of nontasters in North America is 
approximately 45%. Assuming the population is 
in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, what percent of 
the North American population is homozygous 
dominant for the ability to taste PTC? Provide 
your answer as a number between 0 and 1 to the 
nearest hundredth. 
 
 
 
 
122. Based on the data shown, calculate the average 
rate of increase in oxygen consumption for 
animals acclimated to 5∞C as the temperature 
increases from 10°C to 30°C. Give the answer  
in mL O2/g/h/°C to the nearest tenth.

123. To estimate the size of an animal population, 
researchers often use a method known as mark-
recapture, which involves marking individuals 
from a large population for easy identification 
upon recapture. The mark-recapture method 
assumes that the proportion of marked individuals 
in the recapture group is equal to the proportion of
