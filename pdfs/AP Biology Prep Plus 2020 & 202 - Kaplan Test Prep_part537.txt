molecules. The results are not modified by treatment of the
sample with mung bean nuclease, an enzyme that digests single-
stranded DNA.
These results best support which of the following hypotheses?
The E. coli are deficient in gyrases, which unwind DNA
molecules.
(A)
The E. coli are deficient in DNA polymerase I, which fills in
gaps in the DNA molecules.
(B)
The E. coli are deficient in DNA polymerase III, which
synthesizes two new strands simultaneously.
(C)
The E. coli are deficient in ligases, which catalyze the
formation of phosphodiester bonds.
(D)
4. Researchers discovered that two proteins with diﬀerent primary
structures, calcitonin (a parathyroid hormone) and the
neurotransmitter peptide CGRP (expressed in neurons), can be
mapped to the same gene. Two distinct mRNA molecules are
transcribed from the gene in question. The two mRNA sequences
diﬀer in length and sequence, with the exception of identical
sequences found in the region preceding the protein-encoding
regions.
