■ Where Can You Go from Here? 
1. Investigate how guard cells control the opening and closing of stomata, including the 
role of abscisic acid and K+. 
2. Design an experiment to investigate transpiration in two different types of plants 
— one that is drought tolerant and one that requires a significant amount of water. 
What predictions can you make about the rate of transpiration in each? 
3. If you had to revise the design of your experiment, what suggestions would you 
make? Why would you make them? 
4. If your investigations generated other questions that you might want to research, ask 
your teacher if you can conduct other experiments.
