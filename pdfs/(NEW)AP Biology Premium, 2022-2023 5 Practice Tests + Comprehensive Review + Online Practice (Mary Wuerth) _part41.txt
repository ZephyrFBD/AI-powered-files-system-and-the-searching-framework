n = sample size (the number of data points in the data set)
∑ = summation (add all members of the data set, starting with the first member of the set, and continue to the nth
member of the data set)
xi = the ith member of the data set
To calculate the mean, add the values of all the data points in the data set, and then divide that by the sample size.
(Multiplying by  gives the same result as dividing by n.) Here’s how you would calculate the means for data set A
and data set B:
Data Set A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; n = 5
Data Set B: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3; n = 5
Notice that data set A looks very different from data set B, but they both have the same mean. Means can be
distorted or skewed by extreme values in the data set. These two data sets illustrate how looking at just the mean is
sometimes not enough to accurately describe the data set.
The median is the midpoint of the data set. To find the median, place the members of the data set in numerical
order from lowest to highest value. The middle of the d
