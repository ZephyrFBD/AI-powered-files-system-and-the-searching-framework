radient 
is linked to the synthesis of ATP in mitochondria. Construct an explanation of the chemiosmotic model 
by doing each of the following. 
(a) Make a claim about the role of the inner mitochondrial membrane in ATP synthesis.  
(1point maximum; LO 2.5, 2.13) 
(b) Present ONE piece of experimental evidence that supports the role you proposed in part (a). 
(1 point maximum; LO 2.5, 2.13) 
(c) Provide reasoning to explain how the evidence you presented in part (b) supports the claim 
you made in part (a). 
(1 point maximum; LO 2.5, 2.13) 
NOTE: Points are earned in a single row only. 
(a) Claim (1point) 
(b) Evidence (1 point) 
(c) Reasoning (1 point) 
IMM maintains a 
proton gradient 
required for ATP 
synthesis. 
The pH of the intermembrane space 
is lower than the pH of the 
mitochondrial matrix 
ATP can be produced by incubating 
isolated mitochondria with low pH
buffer and ADP + Pi 
Membrane is not permeable to 
hydrogen ions 
Protonophores/uncouplers dissipate
the proton gradie
