■ Modeling 
Not all biological research involves wet lab investigations2. Investigations also can 
involve a quantitative model. Quantitative models are often computer based. Thinking 
about and developing computer models may seem to be a new way of thinking and 
doing biology, but actually you’ve been constructing mental models of biological 
phenomena since you first began your study of biology. Models are simplifications of 
complex phenomena, and are important tools to help drive prediction and identify the 
important factors that are largely responsible for particular phenomena. 
To develop a mathematical model, you must first define the relevant parameters or 
variables. For example, if you were creating a model of disease in a population, you 
might divide the population into three components: the part of the population that is 
susceptible bu
