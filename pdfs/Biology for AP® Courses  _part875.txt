 of
four large, multiprotein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and two small diffusible electron
carriers shuttling electrons between them. The electrons are passed through a series of redox reactions, with a small
amount of free energy used at three points to transport hydrogen ions across a membrane. This process contributes to the
gradient used in chemiosmosis. The electrons passing through the electron transport chain gradually lose energy, High-
energy electrons donated to the chain by either NADH or FADH2 complete the chain, as low-energy electrons reduce
oxygen molecules and form water. The level of free energy of the electrons drops from about 60 kcal/mol in NADH or 45
kcal/mol in FADH2 to about 0 kcal/mol in water. The end products of the electron transport chain are water and ATP. A
number of intermediate compounds of the citric acid cycle can be diverted into the anabolism of other biochemical
molecules, such as nonessential amino acids, sugars, and lipi
