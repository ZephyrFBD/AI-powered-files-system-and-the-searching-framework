Give It Some Thought
Explain the negative deviation from ideal gas behavior of N2 below 300 atm in

ideal value, as seen at the lower pressures in Figures 10.18 and 10.19. When the pressure 
is sufficiently high, however, the volume effects dominate and PV>RT increases to above 
the ideal value.
Temperature determines how effective attractive forces between gas molecules are 
in causing deviations from ideal behavior at lower pressures. Figure 10.19 shows that, at 
pressures below about 400 atm, cooling increases the extent to which a gas deviates from 
ideal behavior. As the gas cools, the average kinetic energy of the molecules decreases. 
This drop in kinetic energy means the molecules do not have the energy needed to over-
come intermolecular attraction, and the molecules will be more likely to stick to each 
other than bounce off each other.
As the temperature of a gas increasesâ€”as, sa
