Posterior Pituitary
The posterior pituitary is significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary. It is a part of the brain, extending
down from the hypothalamus, and contains mostly nerve fibers and neuroglial cells, which support axons that extend from
the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary and the infundibulum together are referred to as the
neurohypophysis.
The hormones antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, and oxytocin are produced by neurons in the
hypothalamus and transported within these axons along the infundibulum to the posterior pituitary. They are released
into the circulatory system via neural signaling from the hypothalamus. These hormones are considered to be posterior
pituitary hormones, even though they are produced by the hypothalamus, because that is where they are released into the
