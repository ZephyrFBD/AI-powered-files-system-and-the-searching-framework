2, 
an amine2 and is therefore acidic, and Br- is the conjugate 
base of a strong acid (HBr) and therefore pH neutral. Because 
the solution contains one ion that is acidic and one that 
has no inï¬‚uence on pH, the solution of CH3NH3Br will be 
acidic.
(d) This solution contains the K+ ion, which is a cation of group 
1A, and the NO3
- ion, which is the conjugate base of the 
strong acid HNO3. Neither of the ions will react with water 
to any appreciable extent, making the solution neutral.
(e) This solution contains Al3+ and ClO4
- ions. Cations, such as 
Al3+, that have a charge of 3+ or higher are acidic. The ClO4
- 
ion is the conjugate base of a strong acid 1HClO42 and there-
fore does not affect pH. Thus, the solution of Al1ClO423 will be 
acidic.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the chemical formulas of five ionic com-
pounds (salts) and asked whether their aqueous solutions will be 
acidic, basic, or neutral.
Plan We can determine whether a solution of a salt is acidic, basic, 
or
