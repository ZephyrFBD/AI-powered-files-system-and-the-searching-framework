▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of the following octahedral complex ions will have 
the fewest number of unpaired electrons?  
(a) 3Cr(H2O)643+ (b) 3V(H2O)643+ (c) 3FeF643- (d) 3RhCl643-  
(e) 3Ni(NH3)642+
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Consider the colors of the ammonia complexes of Co3+ given 
in Table 23.3. Based on the change in color would you expect 
3Co(NH3)5Cl42+ to have a larger or smaller value of ∆ than 
3Co(NH3)643+? Is this prediction consistent with the spectro-
chemical series?
