ive phosphorus and radioactive sulfur to selectively 
label the DNA and proteins of bacteriophage T2, a virus that infects bacteria. After incubating the labeled 
bacteriophage particles with Escherichia coli and separating extracellular phage particles from the bacteria, 
Hershey and Chase measured the amounts of radioactive phosphorus and sulfur inside infected E. coli cells and 
in the liquid growth medium outside the E. coli cells.  
(a) Predict the experimental result that would best support the claim that DNA is the source of heritable 
information, and provide reasoning to explain how the result supports the claim. 
(b) Bacteriophages, like other viruses, consist primarily of a protein coat and packaged DNA. Describe  
the function of ONE critical enzyme in bacterial cells that is necessary for replicating bacteriophage   
DNA.
