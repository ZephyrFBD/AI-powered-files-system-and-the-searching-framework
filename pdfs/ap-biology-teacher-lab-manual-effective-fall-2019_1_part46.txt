■General Safety Precautions
• Do not add substances to the choice chamber unless your teacher has approved them.
• If the substance you add is flammable, such as ethanol, use precaution and do not 
conduct your experiment near a heat source or flame.
• Many of the substances used in this experiment are food items, but you should not 
consume any of them.
• Fruit flies are living organisms that should not be released to the environment. After 
all the investigations are complete, flies should be tapped into a “morgue” through a 
funnel. The morgue typically is a 150-mL beaker that contains about 50 mL of salad 
oil or 70% alcohol. 
For the Student Manual version, the

least 30–40 flies into the chamber, lift up the culture vial, and immediately plug the vial

will escape before
