nisms below
from temperature extremes in the atmosphere, increasing their chances of surviving the cold winter. If ice
were denser than liquid water, the ice would sink, leaving the remaining water in the lake exposed and
vulnerable to more freezing and increasing the likelihood that the lake would freeze solid during the winter.
This would result in fewer organisms in the lake surviving the winter.
■Acting as a great solvent for other polar molecules and for ions: Water has a partially positive end and a
partially negative end. Thus, water can readily dissolve ionic compounds (see Figure 3.5) and other polar
molecules. This makes water an excellent solvent for many biological molecules.

pH
pH (or “power of hydrogen”) measures the concentration of H+ ions in a solution. The formula for pH is the
following:
While you will not be required to calculate pH from [H+] on the AP Biology exam, you should know the following:
A pH less than 7 is
