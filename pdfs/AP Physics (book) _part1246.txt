ulum has a period of 1.85 s on Earth. What is its
period on Mars, where the acceleration of gravity is about
0.37 that on Earth?
28. (I) How long must a simple pendulum be if it is to make
exactly one swing per second? (That is, one complete oscil-
lation takes exactly 2.0 s.)
29. (I) A pendulum makes 28 oscillations in exactly 50 s. What
is its (a) period and (b) frequency?
30. (II) What is the period of a simple pendulum 47 cm long
(a) on the Earth, and (b) when it is in a freely falling 
elevator?
31. (II) Your grandfather clock’s pendulum has a length of
0.9930 m. If the clock runs slow and loses 21 s per day, how
should you adjust the length of the pendulum?
32. (II) Derive a formula for the maximum speed 
of a
simple pendulum bob in terms of g, the length 
and the
maximum angle of swing 
33. (III) A simple pendulum oscillates with an amplitude of
10.0°. What fraction of the time does it spend between
and 
Assume SHM.
34. (III) A clock pendulum oscillates at a frequency of 2.5 Hz.
