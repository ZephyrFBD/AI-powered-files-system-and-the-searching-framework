some. In gametes, 23 chromosomes
are present with two sex chromosomes.
23. Eukaryotic chromosomes are thousands of times
longer than a typical cell. Explain how chromosomes can
fit inside a eukaryotic nucleus.
a.
The genetic material remains distributed in the
nucleus, mitochondria, and chloroplast.
b.
The genome is present in a looped structure, thus
it fits the size of the nucleus.
c.
The DNA remains coiled around proteins to
form nucleosomes.
d.
The genetic material remains bound to the
nuclear envelope, forming invaginations.
24. Briefly describe the events that occur in each phase of
interphase.
a.
G1 - assessment for DNA damage, S -
duplication of genetic material, G2 -
duplication and dismantling organelles
b.
G1 - duplication of organelles, S - duplication
of DNA, G2 - assessment of DNA damage
c.
G1 - synthesis of DNA, S - synthesis of
organelle genetic material, G2 - assessment of
DNA damage
d.
G1 - preparation for DNA synthesis, S -
assessment of DNA damage, M - Division of
c
