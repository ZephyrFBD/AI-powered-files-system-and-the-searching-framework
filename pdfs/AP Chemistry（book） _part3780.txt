 Sketch all possible isomers for the complex with three tfac 
ligands on cobalt(III). (You can use the symbol tt to repre-
sent the ligand.)
 23.76  Which transition metal atom is present in each of the fol-
lowing biologically important molecules: (a) hemoglobin, 
(b) chlorophylls, (c) siderophores, (d) hemocyanine.
 23.77  Carbon monoxide, CO, is an important ligand in coordi-
nation chemistry. When CO is reacted with nickel metal, 
the product is 3Ni(CO)44, which is a toxic, pale yellow liq-
uid. (a) What is the oxidation number for nickel in this 
compound? (b) Given that 3Ni(CO)44 is a diamagnetic 
molecule with a tetrahedral geometry, what is the electron 
configuration of nickel in this compound? (c) Write the 
name for 3Ni(CO)44 using the nomenclature rules for coor-
dination compoun
