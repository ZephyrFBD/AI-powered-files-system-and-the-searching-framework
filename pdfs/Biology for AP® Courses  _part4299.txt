50. What happens to aquatic life in deep lakes when water
freezes during the winter months?
a.
During winters, layer of ice falls on water
surface as it is less dense than water. Water is
densest at 7° C and retains its liquid form below
the water surface. The aquatic life can exist in
liquid water.
b.
During winters, the aquatic life exists in liquid
water, which is present below the surface layer,
by consuming more resources so they can
survive during the harsh winter season.
c.
During winters, a layer of ice forms on the water
surface, as ice is less dense than water. Water is
densest at 4°C and retains its liquid form below
the water surface, where the ice layer is. In
liquid water, the aquatic life can survive using
the resources available.
d.
During winters, ice forms only on the surface
and a few meters below the surface of water.
Water is densest at 4°C and retains its liquid
form below the water surface, where the ice
