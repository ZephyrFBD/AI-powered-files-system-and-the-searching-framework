vated in different
parts of her body. The areas over each twinâ€™s body that are lacking sweat glands will be different and different teeth
will be missing. (See answer to question 53 for an explanation of Xinactivation.)
55. D. The rough endoplasmic reticulum (identified as D) is responsible for synthesizing the glycoprotein. A
glycoprotein is a protein with a carbohydrate attached. Amino acids are assembled into a protein by ribosomes
bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER). After the protein is assembled, the endoplasmic reticulum
attaches the carbohydrate. From there, the glycoprotein is shuttled by a transport vesicle to a Golgi apparatus, where
it is further modified for export. The modified glycoprotein is packaged in another vesicle that transports it to the
plasma membrane. The vesicle fuses with the membrane, releasing the contents from the cell.
56. A. The function of the Golgi apparatus (identified as A) is to modify proteins and lipids. The modified molecules
are
