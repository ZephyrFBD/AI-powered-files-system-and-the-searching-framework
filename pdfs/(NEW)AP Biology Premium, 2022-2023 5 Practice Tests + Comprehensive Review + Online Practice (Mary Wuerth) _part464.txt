is more likely to occur in smaller
populations. For example, assume an allele is found in 10% of a population. If there are 1,000 individuals in the
population, 100 of those individuals would have that allele. It would be likely that at least one of those 100
individuals would survive and reproduce to pass on that allele to the next generation. Now consider a population of
10 individuals. In that small population, only one individual would have that allele. If that one individual failed to
reproduce, that allele would not be passed on to the next generation and would be lost, thereby decreasing the
genetic diversity of the population. Considerations around genetic drift are especially important to conservation
biologists, who are trying to preserve the genetic diversity of endangered species.
Bottleneck Effect
One possible cause of genetic drift is the bottleneck effect. A population bottleneck occurs when the size of a
population is greatly reduced for one or more generations. Natural
