5. A survivorship curve shows the expected mortality (death) rates of members of a population over their
potential life span.
i.
A Type 1 curve is characteristic of species that have few young and invest a lot of energy caring
for them. Survivorship is high for early and midlife individuals, but drops precipitously with
advanced age, indicating that most members of the population live out their potential maximum
life span.
ii. Type II curves describe populations in which the members have more or less the same chance of
dying regardless of age.
iii. A Type III curve is characteristic of species that produce large numbers of offspring, most of
which die before reaching maturity.

Growth Models
A. A population’s growth rate (birth rate minus death rate) is the change in a population’s size per a defined
unit of time; two models are used to describe population growth under different conditions.
