 an interdisciplinary field of study known as neuroscience. Because of its
interdisciplinary nature, this subdiscipline studies different functions of the nervous system using molecular, cellular,
developmental, medical, and computational approaches.

Paleontology, another branch of biology, uses fossils to study life’s history (Figure 1.21). Zoology and botany are the
study of animals and plants, respectively. Biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists, ecologists, or physiologists, to
name just a few areas. This is just a small sample of the many fields that biologists can pursue.

Biology is the culmination of the achievements of the natural sciences from their inception to today. Excitingly, it is the
cradle of emerging sciences, such as the biology of brain activity, genetic engineering of custom organisms, and the biology
of evo
