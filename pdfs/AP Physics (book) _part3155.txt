ll as with the nucleus. Each
electron in a complex atom still occupies a particular state characterized by the
quantum numbers n,
and 
For atoms with more than one electron,
the energy levels depend on both n and
The number of electrons in a neutral atom is called its atomic number, Z;
Z is also the number of positive charges (protons) in the nucleus, and determines
what kind of atom it is. That is, Z determines the fundamental properties that dis-
tinguish one type of atom from another.
To understand the possible arrangements of electrons in an atom, a new 
principle was needed. It was introduced by Wolfgang Pauli (1900–1958; Fig. 28–2)
and is called the Pauli exclusion principle. It states:
No two electrons in an atom can occupy the same quantum state.
Thus, no two electrons in an atom can have exactly the same set of the quantum
numbers n,
and 
The Pauli exclusion principle forms the basis not only
for understanding atoms, but also for understanding molecules and bonding, and
other
