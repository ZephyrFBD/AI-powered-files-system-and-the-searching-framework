you addressed each part of the question.
Question 2
This question is similar to question 1. One major difference is that you need to discuss glycolysis in detail. You also
need to correctly connect glycolysis with the Krebs cycle and ATP production because glycolysis produces 2
pyruvate. The answer to question 1 is for only 1 pyruvate. The second major difference is that you need to include a
discussion of how starches, proteins, and lipids are tied to respiration. That part of the answer follows.
Starches are polymers of glucose. Various enzymes break down starches to glucose, which in turn enter the
glycolytic pathway. Disaccharides like sucrose are catalyzed to glucose and fructose. The glucose enters the
glycolytic pathway at the beginning, but the fructose undergoes some intermediate steps and enters the glycolytic
pathway after a couple of steps.
Lipids are hydrolyzed to glycerol and fatty acids. Both of these components undergo enzymatic reactions that
eventually produce acetyl
