broken and electrons are ultimately transferred to oxygen. Which
of the following best explains why the concentration of electron-
poor hydrogens (H+) does not drastically change as a result?

Crab shells are composed mainly of calcium carbonate, and their
thickness determines how vulnerable crabs are to predators and
environmental factors. Over the past 200 years, ocean
acidification has caused a 25 percent increase in acidity. One
study compared average shell thickness of a crab population 200
years ago to that of a crab population today. The data in the graph
best support which of the following
