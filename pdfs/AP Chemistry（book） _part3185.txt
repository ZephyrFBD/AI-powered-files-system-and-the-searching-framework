 which the electrons move) is the positive electrode.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
The following two half-reactions occur in a voltaic cell:
Ni1s2 ¡ Ni2+1aq2 + 2 e-       1electrode = Ni2
Cu2+1aq2 + 2 e- ¡ Cu1s2 
 
  1electrode = Cu2
Which one of the following descriptions most accurately 
describes what is occurring in the half-cell containing the Cu 
electrode and Cu2+1aq2 solution?
(a) The electrode is losing mass and cations from the salt 
bridge are flowing into the half-cell.
(b) The electrode is gaining mass and cations from the salt 
bridge are flowing into the half-cell.
(c) The electrode is losing mass and anions from the salt 
bridge are flowing into the half-cell.
(d) The electrode is gaining mass and anions from the salt 
bridge are flowing into the half-cell.
