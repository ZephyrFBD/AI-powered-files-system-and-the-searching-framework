quences that serve as binding sites for RNA polymerase. Operators are
noncoding regulatory sequences that serve as binding sites for repressor proteins (a type of regulatory protein).
Structural genes are coding sequences that contain the genetic code for the proteins required to perform the
function of the operon.
The two types of prokaryotic operons you need to understand for the AP Biology exam are inducible operons and
repressible operons.
When determining whether an operon is turned “on” or “off,” consider what would be most advantageous to the bacteria in its environment. If an
operon’s function is to digest a molecule, it is advantageous to the bacteria to turn “off” the operon if the molecule is not present and to turn “on” the
operon if the molecule is present. If an operon’s function is to synthesize a molecule, it is advantageous to turn “on” the operon if the molecule is not
present but advantageous to turn “off” the operon if the molecule is present.
