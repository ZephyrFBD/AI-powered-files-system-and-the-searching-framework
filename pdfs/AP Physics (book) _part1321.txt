so the frequency heard is higher. The wavefronts emitted behind the
truck, on the other hand, are farther apart than when the truck is at rest because
the truck is speeding away from them. Each new wavefront emitted is farther from
the preceding one than when the truck is at rest. Hence, fewer wave crests per second
pass by an observer behind the moving truck (Fig. 12–19b) and the perceived
pitch is lower.
We can calculate the frequency shift by making use of Fig. 12–20. We assume
the air (or other medium) is at rest in our reference frame. We consider first the sta-
tionary observer off to the right in Fig.12–19. In Fig.12–20a, the source of the sound
is shown as a red dot, and is at rest. Two successive wave crests are shown, the
second of which has just been emitted and is still near the source. The distance
between these crests is 
the wavelength. If the frequency of the source is 
then the time between emissions of wave crests is
In Fig. 12–20b, the source is moving with a velocit
