Connection for AP® Courses
Much of the information in this section is not in scope for AP®. However, as a student of biology you should have a
fundamental understanding of how the muscular and skeletal systems work together to provide support and protection while
allowing for a range of movement. Bones provide a storage area for calcium and phosphorus salts and also are the site of
blood cell formation. In a later section, knowledge of the nervous system will be used to understand the musculoskeletal
system because muscle contraction depends on neural input. Events occurring at the neuromuscular junction are similar
to events occurring at synapses between neurons as discussed in the chapter on the nervous system. Humans, and most
animals depend on movement for daily activities. From an evolutionary perspe
