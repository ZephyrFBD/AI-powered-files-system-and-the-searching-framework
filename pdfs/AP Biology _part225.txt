molecules and energy for other functions. (ENE-3)
(C) Most of the ATP produced during cell respiration comes from
oxidative phosphorylation as protons flow through the ATP synthase
channel in the cristae membrane in mitochondria. (ENE-1)
(C) The process is substrate level phosphorylation: the release of
energy by the transfer of a phosphate group from any molecule to
ADP, forming ATP. This process releases a small amount of energy
and occurs during the citric acid cycle and glycolysis. (ENE-1)
(D) This figure shows the electron transport chain (ETC), where no
ATP is produced. The purpose of the ETC is to build a proton or ion
gradient or differential between the inner matrix and outer

compartment of mitochondria. This proton gradient represents great
potential energy. When protons flow down the gradient through
ATP synthase channels (the only place they can flow across the
cristae membrane), energy is released. This e
