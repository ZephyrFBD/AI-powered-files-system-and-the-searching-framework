 20.110  Some years ago a unique proposal was made to raise the 
Titanic. The plan involved placing pontoons within the 
ship using a surface-controlled submarine-type vessel. 
The pontoons would contain cathodes and would be 
Ô¨Ålled with hydrogen gas formed by the electrolysis of 
water. It has been estimated that it would require about 
7 * 108 mol of H2 to provide the buoyancy to lift the ship 
(J. Chem. Educ., 1973, Vol. 50, 61). (a) How many cou-
lombs of electrical charge would be required? (b) What 
is the minimum voltage required to generate H2 and O2 if 
the pressure on the gases at the depth of the wreckage (2 
mi) is 300 atm? (c) What is the minimum electrical energy 
required to raise the Titanic by electrolysis? (d) What is 
the minimum cost of the electrical energy required to 
generate the necessary H2 if the electricity costs 85 cents 
per kilowatt-hour to generate at the site?
