etween an electron and the nucleus depends on the magnitude of 
the nuclear charge and on the average distance between the nucleus and the electron. 
The force increases as the nuclear charge increases and decreases as the electron moves 
farther from the nucleus.
Understanding the attraction between the electron and the nucleus in a hydro-
gen atom is straightforward because we have only one electron and one proton. In a 
many-electron atom, however, the situation is more complicated. In addition to the

attraction of each electron to the nucleus, each electron experiences the  
repulsion due 
to other electrons. These electron–electron repulsions cancel some of the attraction of 
the electron to the nucleus so that the electron experiences less  
attraction than it would 
if the other electrons weren’t there. In essence, each electron in a many-electron atom is 
screened from the nucleus by the other electrons. It therefore experienc
