 13.96  The concentration of gold in seawater has been reported to 
be between 5 ppt (parts per trillion) and 50 ppt. Assuming 
that seawater contains 13 ppt of gold, calculate the number 
of grams of gold contained in 1.0 * 103 gal of seawater.
 13.97  The maximum allowable concentration of lead in drinking 
water is 9.0 ppb. (a) Calculate the molarity of lead in a 9.0-
ppb solution. (b) How many grams of lead are in a swim-
ming pool containing 9.0 ppb lead in 60 m3 of water?
 13.98  Acetonitrile 1CH3CN2 is a polar organic solvent that 
dissolves a wide range of solutes, including many salts. 
The density of a 1.80 M LiBr solution in acetonitrile is 
0.826 g>cm3. Calculate the concentration of the solution 
in (a) molality, (b) mole fraction of LiBr, (c) mass percent-
age of CH3CN.
