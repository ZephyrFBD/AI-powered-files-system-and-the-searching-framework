 as in Fig. 3–11b. The longest 
side of a right triangle, opposite the right angle, is called the hypotenuse, which
we label h. The side opposite the angle 
is labeled o, and the side adjacent is
labeled a. We let h, o, and a represent the lengths of these sides, respectively.

FIGURE 3;11 Starting with an angle as 
in (a), we can construct right triangles of 
different sizes, (b) and (c), but the ratio of
the lengths of the sides does not depend on
the size of the triangle.

We now define the three trigonometric functions, sine, cosine, and tangent (abbre-
viated sin, cos, tan), in terms of the right triangle, as follows:
(3;1)
If we make the triangle bigger, but keep the same angles, then the ratio of the
length of one side to the other, or of one side to the hypotenuse, remains the same.
That is, in Fig. 3–11c we have:
and
Thus the values of sine, cosine, and tangent do not depend on how big the trian-
gle is. They depend only on the size
