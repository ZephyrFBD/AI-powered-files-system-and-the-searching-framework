tate. Where does the
charge go? Usually the excess charge “leaks off” onto water molecules in the air.
This is because water molecules are polar—that is, even though they are neutral,
their charge is not distributed uniformly, Fig. 16–4. Thus the extra electrons on,
say, a charged plastic ruler can “leak off” into the air because they are attracted
to the positive end of water molecules. A positively charged object, on the other
hand, can be neutralized by transfer of loosely held electrons from water mole-
cules in the air. On dry days, static electricity is much more noticeable since the
air contains fewer water molecules to allow leakage of charge. On humid or rainy
days, it is difficult to make any object hold a net charge for long.
16–3 Insulators and Conductors
Suppose we have two metal spheres, one highly charged and the other electrically
neutral (Fig. 16–5a). If we now place a metal object, such as a nail, so that it touches
both spheres (Fig. 16–5b), the previously uncharged
