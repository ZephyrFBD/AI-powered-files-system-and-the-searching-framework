a rate of just under 1 hp.
A human cannot do work at this rate for very long.

This result equals
NOTE The person had to transform more energy than this 2600 J. The total
energy transformed by a person or an engine always includes some thermal
energy (recall how hot you get running up stairs).
W = mgy.
E = gt = (660 Js)(4.0 s) = 2600 J.

W = mgy.
EXAMPLE 6;13
Automobiles do work to overcome the force of friction and air resistance,
to climb hills, and to accelerate. A car is limited by the rate at which it can do
work, which is why automobile engines are rated in horsepower or kilowatts.
A car needs power most when climbing hills and when accelerating. In the next
Example, we will calculate how much power is needed in these situations for a
car of reasonable size. Even when a car travels on a level road at constant 
speed, it needs some power just to do work to overcome the retarding forces of
