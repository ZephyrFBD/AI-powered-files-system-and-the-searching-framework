to have the -2 oxidation state, what is the oxidation state of 
the Cl? What is the electron configuration of Cl in this oxi-
dation state?
 [7.64]  An element X reacts with oxygen to form XO2 and with chlo-
rine to form XCl4. XO2 is a white solid that melts at high tem-
peratures (above 1000 °C). Under usual conditions, XCl4 is a 
colorless liquid with a boiling point of 58 °C. (a) XCl4 reacts 
with water to form XO2 and another product. What is the 
likely identity of the other product? (b) Do you think that 
element X is a metal, nonmetal, or metalloid? (c) By using a 
sourcebook such as the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Phys-
ics, try to determine the identity of element X.
