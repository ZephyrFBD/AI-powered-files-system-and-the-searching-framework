23. Discuss how buffers help prevent drastic swings in pH.
a.
Buffers absorb excess hydrogen and hydroxide
ions to prevent increases or decrease in pH. An
example is the bicarbonate system in human
body.
b.
Buffers absorb extra hydrogen ions to prevent
increases or decreases in pH. An example is the
bicarbonate system in the human body.
c.
Buffers absorb excess hydroxide ions to prevent
increases or decreases in pH. An example of that
is the bicarbonate system in the human body.
d.
Buffers absorb excess hydrogen and hydroxide
ions to prevent increases or decreases in pH. An
example of that is carbonate system in human
body.
24. What are three examples of how the characteristics of
water are important in maintaining life?

a.
First, the lower density of water as a solid versus
a liquid allows ice to float, forming an insulating
surface layer for aquatic life. Second, the high
specific heat capacity of water insulates aquatic
life or bodily
