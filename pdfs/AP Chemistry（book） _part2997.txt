 make iron(III) oxide 
(rust) is spontaneous. Which of these statements about this 
process is/are true? (a) The reduction of iron(III) oxide to iron 
is also spontaneous. (b) Because the process is spontaneous, 
the oxidation of iron must be fast. (c) The oxidation of iron is 
endothermic. (d) Equilibrium is achieved in a closed system 
when the rate of iron oxidation is equal to the rate of iron(III) 
oxide reduction. (e) The energy of the universe is decreased 
when iron is oxidized to rust.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
At 1 atm pressure, CO21s2 sublimes at -78 °C. Is this process 
spontaneous at -100 °C and 1 atm pressure?
Seeking a Criterion for Spontaneity
A marble rolling down an incline or a brick falling from your hand loses potential energy. 
The loss of some form of energy is a common feature of spontaneous change in mechan-
ical systems. In the 1870s, Marcellin Bertholet (1827–1907) suggested that the direction 
of spontaneous changes in chemical systems is determined by the loss
