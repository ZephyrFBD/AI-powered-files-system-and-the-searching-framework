. For example, all eukaryotic cells share common
traits, such as the presence of a cytoskeleton, a nucleus, membrane-
bound organelles, linear chromosomes, and endomembrane systems,
elements that have likely been conserved from some of the earliest life-
forms.
Darwin and Natural Selection
EARLY EVOLUTIONARY IDEAS AND DARWINISM
Although some early scientists believed that species are immutable and
do not evolve or change, others believed that evolution occurs. Theories
of evolution developed long before the time of Charles Robert Darwin
(1809–1882), some even emerging in the ancient world. However, prior to
Darwin, even the scientists who accepted the idea that species change
over time did not have a solid idea for a mechanism that could explain
the changes they observed.
The most well-known hypothesis prior to Darwin was that of Jean-
Baptiste de Lamarck (1744–1829), who suggested that organisms pass
on acquired traits in an attempt to reach a more perfect form. For
example, by Lamarc
