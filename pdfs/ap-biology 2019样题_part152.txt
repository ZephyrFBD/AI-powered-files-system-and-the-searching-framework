LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-1.H
Explain how the process of 
meiosis generates genetic 
diversity.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.H.1
Separation of the homologous chromosomes 
in meiosis I ensures that each gamete 
receives a haploid (1n) set of chromosomes 
that comprises both maternal and paternal 
chromosomes.
IST-1.H.2
During meiosis I, homologous chromatids 
exchange genetic material via a process 
called “crossing over” (recombination), 
which increases genetic diversity among the 
resultant gametes.
IST-1.H.3
Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes involving 
gamete formation—including crossing over, 
the random assortment of chromosomes 
during meiosis, and subsequent fertilization of 
gametes—serves to increase variation.
