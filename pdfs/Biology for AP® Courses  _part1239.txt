There are other approaches to understanding the evolution of meiosis in progress. Different forms of meiosis
exist in single-celled protists. Some appear to be simpler or more “primitive” forms of meiosis. Comparing
the meiotic divisions of different protists may shed light on the evolution of meiosis. Marilee Ramesh and
colleagues[2] compared the genes involved in meiosis in protists to understand when and where meiosis
might have evolved. Although research is still ongoing, recent scholarship into meiosis in protists suggests
that some aspects of meiosis may have evolved later than others. This kind of genetic comparison can tell
us what aspects of meiosis are the oldest and what cellular processes they may have borrowed from in
earlier cells.
