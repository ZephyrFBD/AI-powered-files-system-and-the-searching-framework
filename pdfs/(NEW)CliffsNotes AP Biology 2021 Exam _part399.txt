 things share the same genetic code and, with minor variations, the
same basic biochemical pathways, including those for replication, protein synthesis, respiration, and photosynthesis.
This data strongly favors evolution of different species through modification of ancestral genetic information.
More than 98% of the nucleotide sequences in humans and chimpanzees are identical.
Natural Selection
Natural selection is the differences in survival and reproduction among individuals in a population as a result of
their interaction with the environment. In other words, some individuals possess alleles (genotypes) that generate
traits (phenotypes) that enable them to cope more successfully in their environment than other individuals. The more
successful individuals produce more offspring. Superior inherited traits are adaptations to the environment and
increase an individualâ€™s fitness, or relative ability to survive and leave offspring. When the environment favors a
trait, that is, when a tra
