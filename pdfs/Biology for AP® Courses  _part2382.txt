cifically to attack and kill cancer cells. A genetically modified
adenovirus known as H101 has been used since 2005 in clinical trials in China to treat head and neck
cancers. The results have been promising, with a greater short-term response rate to the combination of
chemotherapy and viral therapy than to chemotherapy treatment alone. This ongoing research may herald
the beginning of a new age of cancer therapy, where viruses are engineered to find and specifically kill
cancer cells, regardless of where in the body they may have spread.
A third use of viruses in medicine relies on their specificity and involves using bacteriophages in the
treatment of bacterial infections. Bacterial diseases have been treated with antibiotics since the 1940s.
However, over time, many bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics. A good example is methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, pronounced “mersa”), an infection commonly acquired in
hospitals. This bacterium is resistant to a
