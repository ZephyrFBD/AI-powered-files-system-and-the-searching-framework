n begins in habitats damaged by fire, floods, insect devastations,
overgrazing, and forest clear-cutting and in disturbed areas such as abandoned agricultural fields, vacant lots,
roadsides, and construction sites. Because these habitats previously supported life, secondary succession, unlike
primary succession, begins on substrates that already bear soil. In addition, the soil contains a community of viable
native seeds called the soil seed bank. Two examples of secondary succession follow:
Succession on abandoned cropland (called old-field succession) typically begins with the germination of r-selected
species from seeds already in the soil (such as grasses and weeds). The trees that ultimately follow are region
specific. In some regions of the eastern United States, pines take root next, followed by various hardwoods such as
oak, hickory, and dogwood.
Succession in lakes and ponds begins with a body of water, progresses to a marsh-like state, then a meadow, and
finally to a climax c
