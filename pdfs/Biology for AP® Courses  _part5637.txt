ell and touch are all phenomena of the brain as a result of
the same process. We don’t taste, smell or feel anything except in the
brain and there are pain relief techniques that seek to block the
signal from the site of discomfort to the brain because if the brain
doesn’t decode that signal we don’t feel pain. Pain is in the brain and
only appears to be at the point of impact thanks to the feedback loop
between them. We don’t see anything until electrical information
from the sight senses is decoded in an area at the back of the brain. If
that area is damaged we can go blind when our eyes are perfectly
okay. So why do we go blind if we damage an eye? We damage the
information processing between the waveform visual information
and the visual decoding area of the brain. If information doesn’t
reach the brain in a form it can decode then we can’t see the visual
reality that it represents. What’s more the brain is decoding only a
fraction of the information it receives and the rest is abs
