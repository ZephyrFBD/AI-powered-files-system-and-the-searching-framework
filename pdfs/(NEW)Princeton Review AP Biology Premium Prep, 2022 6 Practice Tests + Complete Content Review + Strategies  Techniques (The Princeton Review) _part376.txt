ship named the HMS
Beagle. Darwin developed his theory of evolution based on natural selection after studying animals in the Galápagos
Islands and other places.
He observed that there were similar animals on the various islands, but the beaks varied in length on finches, and
necks varied in length on tortoises. There must be a reason why animals in different areas had different traits.
Darwin concluded that it was impossible for the finches and tortoises of the Galápagos simply to “grow” longer
beaks or necks as needed. Rather, those traits were inherited and passed on from generation to generation. So, he
decided there must be a way for populations to evolve and change their traits (i.e., a population of finches
developing longer beaks).
He decided that there must have been a variety of beak lengths originally, but only the longest one was particularly
helpful. Since those finches could eat better, survive better, and reproduce better, they were more likely to contribute
offspring to
