appear to grasp the metal between two or more 
donor atoms, bidentate and polydentate ligands are also known as 
chelating agents (pronounced “KEE-lay-ting”; from the Greek 
chele, “claw”).
What is the oxidation number of the metal in 3Rh1NH325Cl41NO322?
Sample Exercise 23.2 
Determining the Oxidation Number of a Metal in a Complex
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the chemical formula of a coordination com-
pound and asked to determine the oxidation number of its metal 
atom.
Plan To determine the oxidation number of Rh, we need to figure 
out what charges are contributed by the other groups. The overall 
charge is zero, so the oxidation number of the metal must balance 
the charge due to the rest of the compound.
Solve The NO3 group is the nitrate anion, which has a 1- charge. 
The NH3 ligands carry zero charge, and the Cl is a coordinated 
chloride ion, which has a 1- charge. The sum of all the charges 
must be zero:
+  
5(0) + (−1) + 2(−1) = 0
