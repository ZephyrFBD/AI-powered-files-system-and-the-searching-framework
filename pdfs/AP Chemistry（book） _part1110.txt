ity has a positive value, meaning that the anion is higher in energy than are the sep-
arated atom and electron:

The fact that the electron affinity is positive means that an electron will not attach itself 
to an Ar atom; in other words the Ar- ion is unstable and does not form.
Periodic Trends in Electron Affinity
The electron affinities for the s- and p-block elements of the first five periods are shown 
in Figure 7.12. Notice that the trends are not as evident as they are for ionization energy. 
The halogens, which are one electron shy of a filled p subshell, have the most negative 
electron affinities. By gaining an electron, a halogen atom forms a stable anion that has a 
noble-gas configuration (Equation 7.5). The addition of an electron to a noble gas, how-
ever, requires that the electron reside in a higher-energy subshell that is empty in the 
atom (Equation 7.6). Because occupying a higher-energy su
