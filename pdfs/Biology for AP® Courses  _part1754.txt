phan is not present in the cell, the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator; therefore, the operon is
active and tryptophan is synthesized. Because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes turned
off, the trp operon is negatively regulated and the proteins that bind to the operator to silence trp expression are negative
regulators.
Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/trp_operon) to learn more about the trp operon.
What would happen if bacteria did not have trp R?
a.
The cell would not be able to break down tryptophan.
b.
The cell will gradually produce more tryptophan over time.
c.
The cell would not be able to make tryptophan.
d.
The cell would make tryptophan when it was not needed.

Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP): An Activator Regulator
Just as the trp operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences
that act as a positive regulator to
