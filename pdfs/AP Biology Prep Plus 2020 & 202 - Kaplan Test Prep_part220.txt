8. Certain viruses, such as Ebola, have higher mutation rates than
other viruses, such as the virus that causes chicken pox. Which of
the following statements best explains this diﬀerence?
Ebola is a DNA virus, while chicken pox is an RNA virus.
(A)
Ebola is an RNA virus, while chicken pox is a DNA virus.
(B)
Ebola is a DNA virus, while chicken pox is a retrovirus.
(C)
Ebola is an RNA virus, while chicken pox is a retrovirus.

9. Some viruses, such as the dengue virus and the tobacco mosaic
virus, have RNA genomes that are replicated by RNA-dependent
RNA polymerases (RdRPs). These RdRPs have no proofreading
ability. As a result, RdRPs have very high mutation rates. Which of
the following explains the adaptive significance of this?
The high mutation rate is inconsequential because viruses
produce enough oﬀspring to maintain a stable genome.
(A)
Since their genomes are large, RNA viruses typically encode
several additional proteins to proofread
