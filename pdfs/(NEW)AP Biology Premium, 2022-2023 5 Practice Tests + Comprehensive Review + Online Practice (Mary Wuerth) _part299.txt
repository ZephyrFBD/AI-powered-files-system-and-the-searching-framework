Problems that Involve a Monohybrid Cross
One of the simplest types of crosses is called a monohybrid cross. In a monohybrid cross, both parents are
heterozygous (have two different alleles) for the trait. For example, purple flowers are dominant to white flowers in
pea plants. Two heterozygous purple flowers are crossed. The results are shown in Figure 13.1.
TIP
Math is your friend when answering genetics problems! Using simple fractions and the laws of probability will help you solve genetics problems
more accurately and efficiently.

There are three possible genotypes that could result from this cross: PP, Pp, or pp. The probabilities of each are 
, and

There are two possible phenotypes that could result from this cross: purple flowers or white flowers. Since both
the PP and Pp genotypes would result in the p
