 sit farther from the 
pivot than the heavier child in order to provide torques of equal magnitude.
EXERCISE C We did not need to use the force equation to solve Example 9–4 because
of our choice of the axis. Use the force equation to find the force exerted by the pivot.
Forces on a beam and supports. A uniform 1500-kg beam,
20.0 m long, supports a 15,000-kg printing press 5.0 m from the right support
column (Fig. 9–8). Calculate the force on each of the vertical support columns.
APPROACH We analyze the forces on the beam (the force the beam exerts on
each column is equal and opposite to the force exerted by the column on the
beam). We label these forces 
and 
in Fig. 9–8. The weight of the beam
itself acts at its center of gravity, 10.0 m from either end. We choose a con-
venient axis for writing the torque equation: the point of application of 
(labeled P), so 
will not enter the equation (its lever arm will be zero) and we
will have an equation in only one unknown,
SOLUTION The torq
