ndurance. Explain why erythropoietin might be potentially dangerous if taken to enhance athletic
performance.
a.
Erythropoietin increases blood viscosity, which makes it difficult for blood to circulate within the body.
b.
Erythropoietin decreases blood viscosity, which makes it difficult for blood to circulate within the body.
c.
Erythropoietin increases the activity of anorexigenic neurons, which makes it difficult for blood to circulate
within the body.
d.
Erythropoietin increases blood viscosity, which reduces hunger and promotes a feeling of satiety.
Regulation of the Female Reproductive System
In females, FSH stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles. Follicle cells
produce the hormone inhibin, which inhibits FSH production. LH also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of
ovulation, and stimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries, as illustrated in Figure 28.9. Estradiol
and progesterone are
