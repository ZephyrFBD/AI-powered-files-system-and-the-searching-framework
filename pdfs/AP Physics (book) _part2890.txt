It did not turn out so simply. Instead, these puzzles were to be solved only by
the introduction, in the early part of the twentieth century, of two revolutionary
new theories that changed our whole conception of nature: the theory of relativity
and quantum theory.
Physics as it was known at the end of the nineteenth century (what we’ve
covered up to now in this book) is referred to as classical physics. The new
physics that grew out of the great revolution at the turn of the twentieth century
is now called modern physics. In this Chapter, we present the special theory of
relativity, which was first proposed by Albert Einstein (1879–1955; Fig. 26–1) in
1905. In Chapter 27, we introduce the equally momentous quantum theory.
†A reference frame is a set of coordinate axes fixed to some object such as the Earth, a train, or the
Moon. See Section 2–1.
