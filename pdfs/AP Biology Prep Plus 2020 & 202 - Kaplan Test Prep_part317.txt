(B)
Atropine is an irreversible inhibitor of the muscarinic
receptor.
(C)
Atropine has no substantial eﬀect on the response of the
target organ to acetylcholine.

2. Acetylcholine is a known neurotransmitter that initiates muscle
contraction when it binds to ion-gated channels. Epinephrine is a
neurotransmitter of the sympathetic system, which decreases
smooth muscle contraction. It does so by binding to a G-protein-
coupled receptor that triggers adenylyl cyclase to release cAMP,
which activates protein kinase A, causing less interaction between
myosin and actin. In an experiment on smooth muscle tissue, a
baseline of contraction in the absence of chemicals was recorded
for 1 minute before introducing acetylcholine to the system.
Epinephrine was applied 3 minutes aȇer acetylcholine. The graph
shows the response of the smooth muscle tissue to the addition
of acetylcholine followed by epinephrine.
