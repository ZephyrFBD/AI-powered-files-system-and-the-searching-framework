tion produces offspring that are genetically different from their parents. Whether or not the
material in this chapter is required or illustrative as part of your AP® course, you should find the concepts interesting and
relevant to your lives outside the classroom.
Both asexual and sexual reproductive strategies have their advantages and disadvantages. Organisms that reproduce
asexually—for example, bacteria and some eukaryotes—may be at a disadvantage in an unstable or unpredictable
environment because, barring mutation, the identical offspring may not have sufficient genetic variation to survive in new or
different conditions. On the other hand, the rapid rates of asexual reproduction may allow a speedy response to changing
environmental conditions. Although sexual reproduction allows for greater genetic variation in offspring, organisms that
reproduce sexually must maintain males and females in the population, which can limit the ability to colonize new habitats.
