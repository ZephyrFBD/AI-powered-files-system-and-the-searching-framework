seconds to the right with constant acceleration, and the
870-kg load hangs on a light cable at a 5.0° angle to the 
vertical as shown. What is the acceleration of the trolley
and load?
27 ms.

jectiles as they melt. Consider a chunk of snow at the ridge
of a roof with a slope of 34°. (a) What is the minimum
value of the coefficient of static friction that will keep the
snow from sliding down? (b) As the snow begins to melt,
the coefficient of static friction decreases and the snow
finally slips. Assuming that the distance from the chunk to
the edge of the roof is 4.0 m and the coefficient of kinetic
friction is 0.10, calculate the speed of the snow chunk when it
slides off the roof. (c) If the roof edge is 10.0 m abov
