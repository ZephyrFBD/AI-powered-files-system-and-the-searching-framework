18. In some organisms, features that have no function become
vestigial and are ultimately lost. In many cave-dwelling animals,
organs such as the eyes have been lost while other sense organs
have increased in size. Which of the following hypotheses to
explain the loss of nonfunctioning organs would NOT be
considered correct according to the contemporary understanding
of evolution?
Mutations causing the reduction in the size of nonfunctional
organs become fixed
