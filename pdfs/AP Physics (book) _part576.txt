gravitational force exerted by the
Earth,
and the normal force 
exerted upward by the floor. The net
force on the crate is the vector sum of these four forces.
SOLUTION (a) The work done by the gravitational force 
and by the
normal force
is zero, because they are perpendicular to the displacement 
(
in Eq. 6–1):
The work done by 
is
The work done by the friction force is
The angle between the displacement 
and 
is 180° because they point in
opposite directions. Since the force of friction is opposing the motion (and
), the work done by friction on the crate is negative.
(b) The net work can be calculated in two equivalent ways.
(1) The net work done on an object is the algebraic sum of the work done by each
force, since work is a scalar:
(2) The net work can also be calculated by first determining the net force on the
object and then taking the component of this net force along the displacement:
Then the net work is
In the vertical (y) direction, there is no displacement and no work d
