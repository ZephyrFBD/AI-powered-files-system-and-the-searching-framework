Changes in an ecosystem, even the slightest, can elicit an adaptive
response and lead to changes in the behavior of native populations.
When a nonnative species is introduced into an ecosystem, it can disrupt
the balance of the ecosystem and have a negative impact. Nonnative
species that cause harm to the environment, the health of native species,
or the local economy are termed invasive species. An invasive species
can be any kind of living organismâ€”a bird, fish, insect, fungus, bacterium,
plant, seed, or egg.
Invasive species can be a direct or indirect threat to the native population
in the ecosystem. Direct threats include preying on native species, out-
competing for food and resources, out-competing for habitats or
breeding sites, and causing or carrying toxins or disease that native
species are not adapted to deal with. In response to invasive predatory
species and competition, native organisms may change their anti-
predator, foraging,
