19–4:
so
(b) All the current that flows out of the battery passes first through 
and then
through 
because they lie along a single path, Fig. 19–6b. So the current I is
the same in both resistors; the potential difference V across the battery equals
the total change in potential across the two resistors:
Ohm’s law gives
Hence
The equivalent resistance, using Eq. 19–3, is 
We 
can also get 
by thinking from the point of view of the battery: the total
resistance 
must equal the battery voltage divided by the current it delivers:
NOTE The voltage across 
is 
and that
across 
is 
each being half of the battery voltage. A simple
circuit like Fig. 19–6b is thus often called a simple voltage divider.
