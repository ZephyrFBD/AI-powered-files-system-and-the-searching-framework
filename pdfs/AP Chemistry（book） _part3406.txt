he next, as Figure 21.13 shows. There are 440 com-
mercial nuclear power plants in operation in 31 countries, and approximately another 65 
are under construction.
Most nuclear reactors rely on the fission of uranium-235. This was the first 
nuclear fission reaction to be discovered. This nucleus, as well as those of uranium-233

A heavy nucleus can split in many ways, giving rise to a variety of smaller nuclei. 
Two ways that the uran
