 made of phosphates, sugars, and
nitrogen bases. It was the radioactive 32P part of DNA from inside
the bacteriophage that entered and infected the E. coli. That fact
proved that DNA is the heritable material. The radioactive 35S from
the coat of the bacteriophage did not enter the E. coli. (SP 2)
(B) You are given a strand of DNA, which makes a strand of mRNA.
Follow the base-pairing rules: T with A, C with G, C with G, and A
with U. Remember, RNA contains uracil instead of thymine. If the
DNA segment is 5′-TGA AGA CCG-3′, then the mRNA strand
complementary to that is 3′-ACU UCU GGC-5′. (IST-1)
(B) Once transcription has occurred, the new RNA molecule
undergoes 
RNA 
processing. 
During 
this 
process, 
introns
(intervening sequences) are removed with the help of snRNPs, and a
5′ cap and poly(A) tail are added. (IST-1)
(D) Pyrimidines often have the letter y in them. They are thymine,
cytosine, and uracil, which replaces thymine in RNA. Adenine is the
purine; cytosine is the pyrimidin
