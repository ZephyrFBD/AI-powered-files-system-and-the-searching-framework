f mixtures,” a sample of a substance is
heated to a high temperature, which is accurately measured, and then quickly
placed in the cool water of the calorimeter. The heat lost by the sample will be
gained by the water and the calorimeter cup. By measuring the final temperature
of the mixture, the specific heat can be calculated, as illustrated in the following
Example.
