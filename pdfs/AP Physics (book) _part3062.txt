gives rise to the photons of one spectral
line (a single wavelength or frequency).

The vertical arrows in Fig. 27–29 represent the transitions or jumps that
correspond to the various observed spectral lines. For example, an electron
jumping from the level
to
would give rise to the 656-nm line in the
Balmer series, and the jump from
to
would give rise to the 486-nm
line (see Fig. 27–24). We can predict wavelengths of the spectral lines emitted
according to Bohr theory by combining Eq. 27–10 with Eq. 27–15. Since
we have from Eq. 27–10
where n refers to the upper state and 
to the lower state. Then using Eq. 27–15,

This theoretical formula has the same form as the experimental Balmer formula,
