EXERCISE A Instead of the electron in Example 17–2,
suppose a proton
was accelerated from rest by a potential difference
What would be the proton’s (a) change in PE, and (b) final speed?

To better understand electric potential, let’s make a comparison to the gravi-
tational case when a rock falls from the top of a cliff. The greater the height, h,
of a cliff, the more potential energy 
the rock has at the top of the cliff
relative to the bottom, and the more kinetic energy it will have when it reaches
the bottom. The actual amount of kinetic energy it will acquire, and the amount
of work it can do, depends both o
