icircular canals are tubular loops set at oblique angles. They are arranged in three spatial planes. The
base of each canal has a swelling that contains a cluster of hair cells. The hairs project into a gelatinous cap called the cupula
and monitor angular acceleration and deceleration from rotation. They would be stimulated by driving your car around a
corner, turning your head, or falling forward. One canal lies horizontally, while the other two lie at about 45 degree angles to
the horizontal axis, as illustrated in Figure 27.15. When the brain processes input from all three canals together, it can detect
angular acceleration or deceleration in three dimensions. When the head turns, the fluid in the canals shifts, thereby bending
stereocilia and sending signals to the brain. Upon cessation accelerating or decelerating—or just moving—the movement
of the fluid within the canals slows or stops. For example, imagine holding a glass of water. When moving forward, water
may splash backwards
