otherms use their circulatory systems to help maintain body temperature. Vasodilation brings more blood and heat to the
body surface, facilitating radiation and evaporative heat loss, which helps to cool the body. Vasoconstriction reduces blood
flow in peripheral blood vessels, forcing blood toward the core and the vital organs found there, and conserving heat. Some
animals have adaptions to their circulatory system that enable them to transfer heat from arteries to veins, warming blood
returning to the heart. This is called a countercurrent heat exchange; it prevents the cold venous blood from cooling the
heart and other internal organs. This adaption can be shut down in some animals to prevent overheating the internal organs.
The countercurrent adaption is found in many animals, including dolphins, sharks, bony fish, bees, and hummingbirds. In
contrast, similar adaptations can help cool endotherms when needed, such as dolphin flukes and elephant ears.
Some ectothermic animals use cha
