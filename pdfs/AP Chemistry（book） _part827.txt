22, where G is the gravita-
tional constant, G = 6.674 * 10-11N-m2/kg2, m1 and m2 are 
the masses of the two objects, and d is the distance separat-
ing them. What is the gravitational force of attraction (in 
Newtons) between the electron and proton? (c) How many 
times larger is the electrostatic force of attraction?
 5.16 Use the equations given in Problem 5.15 to calculate: (a) The 
electrostatic force of repulsion for two protons separated 
by 75 pm. (b) The gravitational force of attraction for two 
 
protons separated by 75 pm. (c) If allowed to move, will the 
protons be repelled or attracted to one another?
 5.17 A sodium ion, Na+, with a charge of 1.6 * 10-19 C and a chlo-
ride ion, Cl -, with charge of -1.6 * 10-19 C, are separated by 
a distance of 0.50 nm. How much work would be required to 
increase the separation of the two ions to an infinite distance?
 5.18 A magnesium ion, Mg2+, with a charge of 3.2 * 10-19 C and an 
oxide ion, O2-, with a charge of -3.2 * 10-19 C, ar
