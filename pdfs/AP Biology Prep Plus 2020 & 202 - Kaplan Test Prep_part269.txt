avior is due to phototropism. Which of the following
experimental designs would most eﬀectively test this hypothesis?
40 seeds are evenly divided into two groups. Half of the seeds
are grown in pots placed against a wall, allowing the plants to
grow in close proximity to the wall. The other half of the
seeds are grown far from any walls. Aȇer two weeks, the
average angles of plant growth are compared among the
groups.
(A)
200 seeds are evenly divided into two groups. Half of the
seeds are grown with lighting directed from one side only.
The other half of the seeds are grown with diﬀuse lighting
from all directions. Aȇer two weeks, the average angles of
plant growth are compared among the groups.
(B)
10 seeds are evenly divided into two groups. Half of the seeds
are grown with lighting above the pot. The other half of the
seeds are grown with lighting below the pot. Aȇer two weeks,
the average angles of plant growth are compared among the
groups.
(C)
400 seeds are evenly divided into tw
