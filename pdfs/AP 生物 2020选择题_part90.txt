ion of a 
biological concept, process, or 
model. c. Data.
IST-2.A: Describe the types 
of interactions that regulate 
gene expression.
Regulation 
of Gene 
Expression
(A) 
Incorrect. Reducing the number of ribosomes would reduce, but not 
eliminate, the production of oncogene proteins and would also reduce 
the production of all cellular proteins.
(B) 
Incorrect. Blocking transcription factor receptors would impact all cells, 
not just tumor cells.
(C) 
Correct. If a transcription factor is bound to a chemical, it cannot bind 
to the oncogene promoter, thus preventing gene expression that would 
result in tumor formation.
(D) 
Incorrect. Producing transcription factors for tumor suppressor genes 
may reduce the expression of oncogenes but may not completely 
eliminate it.
