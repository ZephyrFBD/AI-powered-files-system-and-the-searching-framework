so be detected and measured by a Geiger counter. The operation 
of this device is based on the fact that radiation is able to ionize matter. The ions and 
electrons produced by the ionizing radiation permit conduction of an electrical current. 
The basic design of a Geiger counter is shown in Figure 21.9. A current pulse between the 
anode and the metal cylinder occurs whenever entering radiation produces ions. Each 
pulse is counted in order to estimate the amount of radiation.
Some substances, called phosphors, emit light when radiation strikes or passes 
through them. The radioactivity excites the atoms, ions, or molecules of the phosphor to 
a higher energy state, and they release this energy as light as they return to their ground 
states. For example, ZnS responds this way to alpha radiation. An instrument called 
a scintillation counter detects and counts the flashes of light produced when radiation 
strikes the phosphor. The flashes of light are magnified electronically and cou
