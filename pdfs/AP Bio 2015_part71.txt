 The cells lining the respiratory tract of pigs have receptors for both avian and human influenza viruses. Based on 
the model above, which of the following best describes the origin of the new strain of human influenza virus? 
(A) The new viral strain inherited a mixture of genetic material from both avian influenza virus and human 
influenza virus.   
(B) The new viral strain inherited RNA molecules from the avian influenza virus and packaged them inside the 
human influenza virus membrane. 
(C) The new viral strain inherited a mutant DNA molecule from the pig respiratory tract cell. 
(D) The new viral strain inherited an RNA molecule that had recombine
