Exercise 2C:
Uses of Mathematical Modeling for Hardy-Weinberg
Interpretation of this Exercise
The above figure shows an example of a program that can mathematically model the frequency of a
specific allele by taking into account the starting frequency of that allele in a population and also the
fitness of each of the genotypes. Once these numbers are applied to the program, then the program
charts the increased frequency of this allele up to 500 generations.
You may be asked to interpret the line chart on the previous page, which indicates that the frequency
of allele A1 steadily increased its presence in the population over 500 generations, and at the 500th
generation, its frequency in the population would be approximately 0.90.
You also may be asked to explain the uses of this type of modeling. With the increased presence of
computer programs able to articulate large amounts of data, programs such as the one a
