solution or bit depth, which 
is the number of bits or values for the voltage of each sample (
measurement);
(ii) the sampling rate, which is the number of times per second the original analog
voltage is measured (“sampled”).
Consider a digital approximation for a 100-Hz sine wave: Figure 17–24 shows 
(i) a 0 to 6-V, 2-bit depth, measuring only 4 possible voltages (00, 01, 10, 11,
or 0, 1, 2, 3 in decimal), and (ii) a sampling rate of (9 samples in one cycle or
wavelength
100 cycles
) which is 900 samples s or 900 Hz. This is very
poor quality. For high quality reproduction, a greater bit depth and higher sampling
rate are needed, which requires more memory, and more data to be transmitted.
