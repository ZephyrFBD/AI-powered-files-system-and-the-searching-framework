cation–anion distances are as close as those permitted by ionic radii, but the anion–
anion and cation–cation distances are maximized.

Why don’t metals cleave in the way 
depicted here for ionic substances?
A shear stress is applied to an ionic crystal.

Planes of atoms slide in response to stress.   
Repulsive interactions between ions of like 
charge lead to separation of the layers.

▲ Figure 12.24 Brittleness and faceting in ionic 
crystals. (a) When a shear stress (blue arrows) is 
applied to an ionic solid, the crystal separates along 
a plane of atoms as shown. (b) This property of ionic 
crystals is used to facet gemstones, such as rubies.
Give It Some Thought
Is it possible for all atoms in an ionic compound to lie on the lattice points as
