the translational kinetic energy.
8–8 Angular Momentum and
Its Conservation
Throughout this Chapter we have seen that if we use the appropriate angular
variables, the kinematic and dynamic equations for rotational motion are anal-
ogous to those for ordinary linear motion. We saw in the previous Section,
for example, that rotational kinetic energy can be written as 
which is
analogous to the translational kinetic energy,
In like manner, the linear
momentum,
has a rotational analog. It is called angular momentum, L.
For a symmetrical object rotating about a fixed axis through the CM, the angular
momentum is
(8;18)
where I is the moment of inertia and 
is the angular velocity about the axis of
rotation. The SI units for L are 
which has no special name.
We saw in Chapter 7 (Section 7–1) that Newton’s second law can be written
not only as 
but also more generally in terms of momentum (Eq. 7–2),
In a similar way, the rotational equivalent of Newton’s second
law, which we saw in Eq. 8–14 ca
