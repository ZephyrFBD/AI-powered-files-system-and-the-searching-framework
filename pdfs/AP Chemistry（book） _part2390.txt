eciprocal of the expression in Equation 15.17. The equilibrium- 
constant expression for a reaction written in one direction is the reciprocal of the expression for 
the reaction written in the reverse direction. Consequently, the numerical value of the equi-
librium constant for the reaction written in one direction is the reciprocal of that for the 
reverse reaction. Both expressions are equally valid, but it is meaningless to say that the 
equilibrium constant for the equilibrium between NO2 and N2O4 is “0.212” or “4.72” 
unless we indicate how the equilibrium reaction is written and specify the temperature. 
Therefore, whenever you are using an equilibrium constant, you should always write the 
associated balanced chemical equation.
The following diagrams represent three systems at equilibrium, all in the 
same-size containers. (a) Without doing any calculations, rank the systems 
in order of increasing Kc. (b) If the volume of the containers is 1.0 L and 
each sphere represents 0.
