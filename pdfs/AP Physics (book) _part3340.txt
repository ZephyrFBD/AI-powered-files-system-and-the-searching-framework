otal mass of a stable nucleus is always less than the sum of the masses of its
separate protons and neutrons, as the following Example shows.
mass compared to its constituents. Compare the
mass of a 
atom to the total mass of its constituent particles.
APPROACH The 
nucleus contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Tables normally
give the masses of neutral atomsâ€”that is, nucleus plus its Z electrons. We must
therefore be sure to balance out the electrons when we compare masses. Thus we
use the mass of 
rather than that of a proton alone. We look up the mass 
of the 
atom in Appendix B (it includes the mass of 2 electrons), as well as 
the mass for the 2 neutrons and 2 hydrogen atoms (= 2 protons + 2 electrons).
