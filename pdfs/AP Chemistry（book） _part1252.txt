 Cl2 or H2, the electron pairs must be shared 
equally. When two atoms from opposite sides of the periodic table bond, such as NaCl, 
there is relatively little sharing of electrons, which means that NaCl is best described as 
an ionic compound composed of Na+ and Cl- ions. The 3s electron of the Na atom is, in 
effect, transferred completely to chlorine. The bonds that are found in most substances 
fall somewhere between these extremes.
Bond polarity is a measure of how equally or unequally the electrons in any cova-
lent bond are shared. A nonpolar covalent bond is one in which the electrons are 
shared equally, as in Cl2 and N2. In a polar covalent bond, one of the atoms exerts a 
greater attraction for the bonding electrons than the other. If the difference in relative 
ability to attract electrons is large enough, an ionic bond is formed.
Electronegativity
We use a quantity called electronegativity to estimate whether a given bond is nonpolar 
covalent, polar covalent, or ionic.
