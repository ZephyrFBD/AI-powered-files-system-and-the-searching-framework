water’s reflection to air’s long-wave radiation
wa

Heat flux made by the radiation of the water’s long-wave return
e

Heat flux made by the evaporation of the water in the bathtub
c

Heat flux made by the heat conduction between water and air
a
T
The temperature of the air
T
The temperature of the water in the bathtub
a
e
Vapor pressure of the air above the water
m
The weight of the water filled the bathtub
c
The specific heat capacity of the water in the bathtub
S
The contact area of water and air
6.2 Model assumption

Considering the process of cooling in the natural condition, the temperature of the
water in the bathtub is equal and changes at the same time consistently regardless
of its position.

The temperature of the air doesn’t change as the time flows. T
