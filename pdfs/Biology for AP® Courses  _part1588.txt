e mismatch repair enzyme would
lead to more permanent damage.
d.
Mismatch repair corrects the errors after the
replication is completed by excising the
incorrectly added nucleotide and adding the
correct base. Any mutation in the mismatch
repair enzyme would lead to more temporary
damage.
51. A mutation has occurred in the DNA and in the mRNA
for a gene. Discuss which would have a more significant
effect on gene expression. Why?
a.
Both will result in the production of defective
proteins. The DNA mutation, if not corrected, is
permanent, while the mRNA mutation will only
affect proteins made from that mRNA strand.
Production of defective protein ceases when the
mRNA strand deteriorates.
b.
Both will result in the production of defective
proteins. The DNA mutation, if not corrected, is
permanent, while the mRNA mutation will not
affect proteins made from that mRNA strand.
Production of defective protein continues when
the mRNA strand deteriorates.
c.
Only DNA will result in the producti
