ING UNDERSTANDING
IST-4
The processing of genetic information is imperfect and is a source of genetic variation.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-4.A
Explain how changes in 
genotype may result in 
changes in phenotype.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-4.A.1
Errors in DNA replication or DNA repair 
mechanisms, and external factors, including 
radiation and reactive chemicals, can cause 
random mutations in the DNA—
a.	Whether a mutation is detrimental, beneficial, or 
neutral depends on the environmental context. 
b.	Mutations are the primary source of 
genetic variation.
IST-4.A.2
Errors in mitosis or meiosis can result in 
changes in phenotype—
a.	Changes in chromosome number often result 
in new phenotypes, including sterility caused by 
triploidy, and increased vigor of other polyploids.
b.	Changes in chromosome number often 
result in human disorders with developmental 
limitations, including Down syndrome/
Trisomy 21 and Turner syndrome. 
IST-4.B
Explain how alterations in 
DNA sequences contribute
