it. Then, place all of the beads back in the bottle and repeat the experiment
four more times.
Analyze the data: Compare the five populations that resulted from the experiment. Do the populations all
contain the same number of different colored beads, or do they vary? Remember, these populations all
came from the same exact parent population.
Form a conclusion: Most likely, the five resulting populations will differ quite dramatically. This is because
natural disasters are not selectiveâ€”they kill and spare individuals at random. Now think about how this
might affect a real population. What happens when a hurricane hits the Mississippi Gulf Coast? How do the
seabirds that live on the beach fare?
Gene Flow
Another important evolutionary force is gene flow: the flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the migration of
individuals or gametes (Figure 19.6). While some populations are fairly stable, others experience more flux. Many plants,
for example, send their pollen far and wid
