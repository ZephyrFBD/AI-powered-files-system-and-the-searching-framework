be released on later turns of the
cycle; thus, all six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are eventually incorporated into carbon dioxide. Each
turn of the cycle forms three NADH molecules and one FADH2 molecule. These carriers will connect with the last portion
of aerobic respiration to produce ATP molecules. One GTP or ATP is also made in each cycle. Several of the intermediate
compounds in the citric acid cycle can be used in synthesizing non-essential amino acids; therefore, the cycle is amphibolic
(both catabolic and anabolic).
Think About It
Explain how citrate from the citric acid cycle might affect glycolysis. What other factors might affect the efficiency of
the citric acid cycle and its products?
