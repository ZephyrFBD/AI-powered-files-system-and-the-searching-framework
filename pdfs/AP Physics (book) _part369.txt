APPROACH Figure 4–17 shows all the forces that act on the woman (and only
those that act on her). The direction of the acceleration is downward, so 
we choose the positive direction as down (this is the opposite choice from
Examples 4–6 and 4–7).
SOLUTION (a) From Newton’s second law,
We solve for 
and it acts upward. The normal force 
is the force the scale exerts on the
person, and is equal and opposite to the force she exerts on the scale:
downward. Her weight (force of gravity on her) is still
But the scale, needing to exert a force of 
only 0.80mg, will give a reading of
(b) Now there is no acceleration,
so by Newton’s second law,
and  
The scale reads her true mass of 65 kg.
NOTE The scale in (a) gives a reading of 52 kg (as an “apparent mass”), but 
her mass doesn’t change as a result of the acceleration: it stays at 65 kg.
