ral disaster that kills—at random—a large portion of
the population. Known as the bottleneck effect, it results in a large portion of the genome suddenly being wiped out (Figure
19.5). In one fell swoop, the genetic structure of the survivors becomes the genetic structure of the entire population, which
may be very different from the pre-disaster population.

Figure 19.5 A chance event or catastrophe can reduce the genetic variability within a population.
Another scenario in which populations might experience a strong influence of genetic drift is if some portion of the
population leaves to start a new population in a new location or if a population gets divided by a physical barrier of
some kind. In this situation, those individuals are unlikely to be representative of the entire population, which results in
the founder effect. The founder effect occurs when the genetic structure changes to match that of the new population’s
founding father
