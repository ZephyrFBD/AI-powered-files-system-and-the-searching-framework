The formal charges on the atoms are shown in red. In the left structure, the P atom obeys 
the octet rule. In the right structure, however, the P atom has five electron pairs, leading 
to smaller formal charges on the atoms. (You should be able to see that there are three 
additional resonance structures for the Lewis structure on the right.)
Chemists are still debating which of these two structures is dominant for PO4
3 -. 
Recent theoretical calculations based on quantum mechanics suggest to some research-
ers that the left structure is the dominant one. Other researchers claim that the bond 
lengths in the ion are more consistent with the right structure being dominant. This dis-
agreement is a convenient reminder that, in general, multiple Lewis structures can con-
tribute to the actual electron distribution in an atom or molecule.
