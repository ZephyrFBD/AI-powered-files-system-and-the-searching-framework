transcribed into mRNA and translated into proteins which orchestrate nearly every
function of the cell. The genetic code refers to the DNA alphabet (A, T, C, G), the RNA alphabet (A, U, C, G), and the
polypeptide alphabet (20 amino acids). But how do genes located on a chromosome ultimately produce a polypeptide that
can result in a physical phenotype such as hair or eye colorâ€”or a disease like cystic fibrosis or hemophilia?
The Central Dogma describes the normal flow of genetic information from DNA to mRNA to protein: DNA in genes specify
sequences of mRNA which, in turn, specify amino acid sequences in proteins. The process requires two steps, transcription
and translation. During transcription, genes are used to make messenger RNA (mRNA). In turn, the mRNA is used to
direct the synthesis of proteins during the process of translation. Translation also requires two other types of RNA: transfer
RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The genetic code is a triplet code, with each RNA codon
