o children on a
seesaw, Example 9–4. (b) Free-body
diagram of the board.
Balancing a seesaw. A board of mass
serves
as a seesaw for two children, as shown in Fig. 9–7a. Child A has a mass of 30 kg
and sits 2.5 m from the pivot point, P (his center of gravity is 2.5 m from the
pivot). At what distance x from the pivot must child B, of mass 25 kg, place herself
to balance the seesaw? Assume the board is uniform and centered over the pivot.
APPROACH We follow the steps of the Problem Solving Strategy above.
SOLUTION
1. Free-body diagram. We choose the board as our object, and assume it is hor-
izontal. Its free-body diagram is shown in Fig. 9–7b. The forces acting on the
board are the forces exerted downward on it by each child,
and 
the
upward force exerted by the pivot 
and the force of gravity on the board
which acts at the center of the uniform board.
2. Coordinate system. We choose y to be vertical, with positive upward, and x
horizontal to the right, with origin at the pivot.
