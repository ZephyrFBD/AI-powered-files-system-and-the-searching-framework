osis (M). MPF stands for maturation promoting factor, but you
may think of it as M phase promoting factor. MPF contributes to
molecular events required for chromosome condensation and spindle
formation during prophase.
After M phase, during anaphase, MPF switches off by initiating a
process that leads to the breakdown of cyclin. The noncyclin part of MPF,
the Cdk, persists in the cell in an inactive form until it becomes part of
MPF again. This can be seen in Figure 4.7.

The details of MPF and PDGF are presented as illustrative examples only (to help you
understand how internal and external signals regulate the cell cycle). You are not
required to memorize them.
Figure 4.7 Kinase (Cdk) and Cyclin Regulating Cell Cycle (When MPS
passes the G2 checkpoint, mitosis occurs.)
The activity of a Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase, rises and falls with
changes in the concentration of its cyclin partner. Figure 4.8 shows the
fluctuation activity of MPF, the
