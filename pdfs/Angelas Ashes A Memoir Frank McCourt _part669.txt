in a 
 
 private place with yourself or with another or with some class of a beast. 
 
 Somewhere down there in the fields or along the banks of the Shannon 
 
 a boy or a milkmaid might have looked up and seen me in my sin and 
 
 if they did I’m doomed because the priests are always saying that anyone 
 
 who exposes a child to sin will have a millstone tied around his 
 
 neck and be cast into the sea. 
 
 Still, the thought of someone watching me brings on the excitement 
 
 again. I wouldn’t want a small boy to be watching me.No,no, that 
 
 would surely lead to the millstone, but if there was a milkmaid gawking 
 
 up she’d surely get excited and go at herself though I don’t know if girls 
 
 can go at themselves when they don’t have anything to go at. No equipment, 
 
 as Mikey Molloy used to say. 
 
 I wish that old deaf Dominican priest would come back so that I 
 
 could tell him my troubles with the excitement but he’s dead now and 
 
 I’ll have to face a priest who’ll go on
