nvolves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one
location.
Biologists think of speciation events as the splitting of one ancestral species into two descendant species. There is no reason
why there might not be more than two species formed at one time except that it is less likely and multiple events can be
conceptualized as single splits occurring close in time.
Allopatric Speciation
A geographically continuous population has a gene pool that is relatively homogeneous. Gene flow, the movement of alleles
across the range of the species, is relatively free because individuals can move and then mate with individuals in their new
location. Thus, the frequency of an allele at one end of a distribution will be similar to the frequency of the allele at the other
end. When populations become geographically discontinuous, that free-flow of alleles is prevented. When that separation
lasts for a period of time, the two populations are able to evolve along different trajectori
