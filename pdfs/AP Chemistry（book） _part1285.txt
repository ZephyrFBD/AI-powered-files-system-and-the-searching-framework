tom. For example, consider the Lewis structure of HCl 
in Figure 8.12(a). To assign oxidation numbers, both electrons in the 
covalent bond between the atoms are assigned to the more electro-
negative Cl atom. This procedure gives Cl eight valence electrons, 
one more than in the neutral atom. Thus, its oxidation number is 
-1. Hydrogen has no valence electrons when they are counted this 
way, giving it an oxidation number of +1.
In assigning formal charges to the atoms in HCl [Figure 8.12(b)], 
we ignore electronegativity; the electrons in bonds are assigned 
equally to the two bonded atoms. In this case Cl has seven assigned 
electrons, the same as that of the neutral Cl atom, and H has one as-
signed electron. Thus, the formal charges of both Cl and H in this 
compound are 0.
Neither oxidation number nor formal charge gives an accurate 
depiction of the actual charges on atoms because oxidation num-
bers overstate the role of electronegativity and formal charges ig-
nore it. It seem
