Another aspect of phylogenetic trees is that, unless otherwise indicated, the branches do not account for length of time, only
the evolutionary order. In other words, the length of a branch does not typically mean more time passed, nor does a short
branch mean less time passedâ€” unless specified on the diagram. For example, in Figure 20.4, the tree does not indicate
how much time passed between the evolution of amniotic eggs and hair. What the tree does show is the order in which
things took place. Again using Figure 20.4, the tree shows that the oldest trait is the vertebral column, followed by hinged
jaws, and so forth. Remember that any phylogenetic tree is a part of the greater whole, and like a real tree, it does not grow
in only one direction after a new branch develops. So
