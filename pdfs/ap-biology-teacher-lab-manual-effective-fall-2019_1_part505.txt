ipette. 
Note: Excessive heat (≥60°C) will destroy ampicillin. With this in mind, 
here’s the tricky part: the nutrient agar solidifies at 27°C, so you must be careful to 
monitor the cooling of the agar and then pour the plates from start to finish without 
interruption. Keeping the flask with liquid agar in a water bath set to 45–50°C can 
help prevent the agar from cooling too quickly. Before adding ampicillin to the flask 
of agar, make sure you can hold the flask in your bare hand (approximately 50°C). If 
your hand tolerates the temperature of the flask, so will the antibiotic! 
3. Label plates. 
While the agar is cooling, reduce preparation time by labeling the plates. Label with 
a permanent marker on the bottom of each plate close to the edge. For each class 
using an eight-station kit, label 16 plates LB and 16 plates LB/amp. 
Pour nutrient agar plates. 
First, pour LB nutrient agar into the 16 plates that are labeled LB. If you do not 
do this and add ampicillin to the flask
