ce B is not correct because while anaerobic organisms carry out
glycolysis, glycolysis is the first stage of aerobic respiration in all
aerobic organisms. Choice C is not correct because the citric acid
cycle uses pyruvate as a raw material; it does not produce it. Choice
D is not correct because the ETC does not produce any ATP. It sets
the stage for the production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation.
(ENE-1)
(C) “Ion gradient” could also be written as “proton gradient.” Choice
A is not correct because oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the
ETC. It does not carry protons. Choice B is not correct because
substrate level phosphorylation is the mechanism by which ATP is
produced during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Choice D is not
correct because it is the ETC that pumps protons across the cristae
membrane, creating a gradient. (ENE-1)
(B) The three processes result in the complete breakdown of glucose.
Process A represents glycolysis. Process B represents the citric acid
