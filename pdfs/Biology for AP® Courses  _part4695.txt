s, the ecosystem is
recreated which may alter the dynamics of the
ecosystem the experiments are aiming to
analyze.
d.
Altering a natural ecosystem through
partitioning, which occurs in both the
experiments may change its dynamics due to
differences in species numbers and diversity.
25. If a scientist wanted to monitor a desert food chain,
what type of model might they develop and why?
a.
An analytical model would be ideal because they
can address simple, linear ecosystem
components that are mathematically complex.
b.
A simulation model would be ideal because they
can address simple, linear systems that are
mathematically complex.
c.
An analytical model would be ideal as they are
considered ecologically more realistic than any
other model.
d.
A simulation model would be ideal because it
uses numerical techniques to solve problems and
visualize the complex relationships that exist in
the ecosystem.
26. Compare and contrast food chains and food webs.
What are the strengths of each concept
