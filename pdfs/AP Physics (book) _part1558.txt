by a cube 10 cm on a side with five
sides exposed, has a surface area of about
The
rate of heat loss would be about
or about 20 W for the ceramic pot 
and 3 W for the shiny one 
(b) To estimate the temperature drop, we use the specific heat of water and
ignore the contribution of the pots. The mass of 0.75 L of water is 0.75 kg. (Recall
that 
and
) Using Eq. 14–2
and Table 14–1, we get
Then
After 30 min (1800 s),
or about 12 C° for the ceramic pot 
and about 2 C° for the shiny one
The shiny one clearly has an advantage, at least in terms of radiation.
NOTE Convection and conduction could play a greater role than radiation.
