sequent care of offspring. Fecundity describes
how many offspring could be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible. In animals, fecundity is inversely
proportional to the amount of care given to an individual offspring.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 and Big Idea 2
of the AP速 Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP速 exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
