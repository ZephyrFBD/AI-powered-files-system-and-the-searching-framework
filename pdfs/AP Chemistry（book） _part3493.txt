tifying Elemental Properties
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given a list of elements and asked to predict several 
properties that can be related to periodic trends.
Plan We can use Figures 22.1 and 22.2 to guide us to the answers.
Solve
(a) Electronegativity increases as we proceed toward the upper 
right portion of the periodic table, excluding the noble 
gases. Thus, N is the most electronegative element of our 
choices.
(b) Metallic character correlates inversely with electronegativityâ€”the 
less electronegative an element, the greater its metallic character. 
The element with the greatest metallic character is therefore K, 
which is closest to the lower left corner of the periodic table.
(c) Nonmetals tend to form molecular compounds, so we can 
narrow our choice to the three nonmetals on the list: N, P
, 
and Ne. To form more than four bonds, an element must be 
able to expand its valence shell to allow more than an octet of 
electrons around it. Valence-shell expansion occurs for period
