2. When you apply the torque equation 
to an object
in equilibrium, the axis about which torques are calculated
(a) must be located at a pivot.
(b) must be located at the object’s center of gravity.
(c) should be located at the edge of the object.

what the angle of the cable.
(b) could be less than half the beam’s weight for some
angles.
(c) will be half the beam’s weight for all angles.
(d) will equal the beam’s weight for all angles.
