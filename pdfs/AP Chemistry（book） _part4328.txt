.2)
noble gases Members of group 8A in the periodic table. 
(Section 7.8)
nodal plane In an antibonding orbital, the plane in the 
region between the nuclei where the electron density is zero. 
(Section 9.7)
node Points in an atom at which the electron density is zero. 
For example, the node in a 2s orbital is a spherical surface. 
(Section 6.6)
nonbonding pair In a Lewis structure a pair of electrons assigned 
completely to one atom; also called a lone pair. (Section 8.3)
nonelectrolyte A substance that does not ionize in water and 
consequently gives a nonconducting solution. (Section 4.1)
nonionizing radiation Radiation that does not have sufficient 
energy to remove an electron from a molecule. (Section 21.9)
nonmetallic elements (nonmetals) Elements in the upper right 
corner of the periodic table; nonmetals differ from metals in 
their physical and chemical properties. (Section 2.5)
nonpolar covalent bond A covalent bond in which the electrons 
are shared equally. (Section 8.4)
