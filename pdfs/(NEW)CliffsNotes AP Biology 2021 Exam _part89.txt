at project from the plasma membrane to provide motility to the cell.
Intermediate filaments provide support for maintaining the shape of the cell.
Microfilaments (actin filaments) are made of the protein actin and are involved in cell motility. They are found in
muscle cells and in cells that move by changing shape, such as phagocytes (white blood cells that wander throughout
the body, attacking bacteria and other foreign invaders). In plants, microfilaments promote the movement of
cytoplasmic materials around the cell (cytoplasmic streaming).
10. Flagella and cilia are structures that protrude from the cell membrane and make wave-like movements. Flagella
and cilia are classified by their lengths, by their numbers per cell, and by their movement: Flagella are long, few, and
move in a snake-like motion; cilia are short, many, and move with a back-and-forth, serpentine movement. A single
flagellum propels sperm, while the numerous cilia that line the respiratory tract sweep away debris.
