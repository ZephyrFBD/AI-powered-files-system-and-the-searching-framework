icularly in electronic devices, resistors are used to con-
trol the amount of current. Resistors have resistances ranging from less than an
ohm to millions of ohms (see Figs. 18–11 and 18–12). The main types are “wire-
wound” resistors which consist of a coil of fine wire, “composition” resistors
which are usually made of carbon, resistors made of thin carbon or metal 
films, and (on tiny integrated circuit “chips”) undoped semiconductors.
When we draw a diagram of a circuit, we use the symbol
[resistor symbol]
to indicate a resistance. Wires whose resistance is negligible, however, are shown
simply as straight lines. Figure 18–12 and its Table show one way to specify the 
resistance of a resistor.
