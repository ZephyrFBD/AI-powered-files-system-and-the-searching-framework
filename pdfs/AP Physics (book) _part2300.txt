 current. Such a cur-
rent is called an induced current. When the magnetic field through coil Y changes,
a current occurs in Y as if there were a source of emf in circuit Y. We therefore say that
a changing magnetic field induces an emf.
Faraday did further experiments on electromagnetic induction, as this phenom-
enon is called. For example, Fig. 21–2 shows that if a magnet is moved quickly into
a coil of wire, a current is induced in the wire. If the magnet is quickly removed,
a current is induced in the opposite direction (
through the coil decreases).
Furthermore, if the magnet is held steady and the coil of wire is moved toward 
or away from the magnet, again an emf is induced and a current flows. Motion or
change is required to induce an emf. It doesn’t matter whether the magnet or the
coil moves. It is their relative motion that counts.
