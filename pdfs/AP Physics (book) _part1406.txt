e volume increase of the gasoline minus the
increase in volume of the tank.
SOLUTION The gasoline expands by
The tank also expands. We can think of it as a steel shell that undergoes volume
expansion
If the tank were solid, the surface layer
(the shell) would expand just the same (as in Example 13–4). Thus the tank
increases in volume by
so the tank expansion has little effect. More than a liter of gas could spill out.
¢V = A35 * 10–6C°B(70 L)(40°C - 20°C) = 0.049 L,
Ab = 35 * 10–6C° L 3aB.
= 1.3 L.
¢V = bV
0 ¢T = A950 * 10–6C°B(70 L)(40°C - 20°C)

Anomalous Behavior of Water Below 4°C
Most substances expand more or less uniformly with an increase in temperature,
as long as no phase change occurs. Water, however, does not follow the usual pat-
tern. If water at 0°C is heated, it actually decreases in volume until it reaches 4°C.
Above 4°C water behaves normally and expands in volume as the temperature is
increased, Fig. 13–13. Water thus has its greatest density at 4°C.
