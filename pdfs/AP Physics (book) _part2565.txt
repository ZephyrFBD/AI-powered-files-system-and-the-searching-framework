 Fig. 23–37c. This ray therefore emerges from
the lens at the same angle as it entered. The ray would be displaced slightly 
to one side, as we saw in Example 23–8; but since we assume the lens is thin,
we draw ray 3 straight through as shown.
The point where these three rays cross is the image point for that object point.
Actually, any two of these rays will suffice to locate the image point, but drawing
the third ray can serve as a check.
