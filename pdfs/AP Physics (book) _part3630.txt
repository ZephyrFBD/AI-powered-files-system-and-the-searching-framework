 there are many more background events around 125 GeV than there
are in the resonance bump representing the Higgs boson.

1 Grand Unified Theories
The Standard Model, for all its success, cannot explain some important issues—
such as why the charge on the electron has exactly the same magnitude as the
charge on the proton. This is crucial, because if the charge magnitudes were even
a little different, atoms would not be neutral and the resulting large electric
forces would surely have made life impossible. Indeed, the Standard Model is
now considered to be a low-energy approximation to a more complete theory.
With the success of unified electroweak theory, theorists are trying to
incorporate it and QCD for the strong (color) force into a so-called grand unified
theory (GUT).
One type of such a grand unified theory of the electromagnetic, weak, and
strong forces has been proposed in which there is only one class of particle—
leptons and quarks belong to the same family and are able
