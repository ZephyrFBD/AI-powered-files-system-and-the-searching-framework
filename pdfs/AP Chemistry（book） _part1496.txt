atom? [Sections 9.2 and 9.3]

The following plot shows the potential energy of two Cl atoms 
as a function of the distance between them. (a) If the two atoms 
are very far away from each other, what is their potential energy 
of interaction? (b) We know that the Cl2 molecule exists. What 
is the approximate bond length and bond strength for the Cl–
Cl bond in Cl2 from this graph? (c) If the Cl2 molecule is com-
pressed under higher and higher pressure, does the Cl–Cl bond 
become stronger or weaker?

9.6  The orbital diagram that follows presents the final step in the 
formation of hybrid orbitals by a silicon atom. (a) Which of 
the following best describes what took place before the step 
pictured in the diagram: (i) Two 3p electrons became un-
paired, (ii) An electron was promoted from the 2p orbital to 
the 3s orbital, or (iii)
