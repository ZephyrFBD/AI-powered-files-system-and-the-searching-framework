the
mutations occurring in cancerous cells reverses this
modification, allowing the cancer cell to continue dividing.
(A)
In normal cells, mitosis alternates with interphase in the cell
cycle, allowing it to enter into a stage where it no longer
divides; however, one of the mutations occurring in
cancerous cells makes them unable to enter the interphase
portion of the cell cycle, so they are therefore forced to
continuously divide in the mitotic stage.
(B)
During mitosis in a cell that has already divided 51 times, the
parent cell passes on all of its genetic information to only one
of the daughter cells, so that the other can no longer divide;
however, one of the mutations occurring in cancerous cells
counteracts this, allowing both daughter cells to receive the
parentâ€™s DNA.
(C)
As normal cells pass through the cell cycle, the protective
ends of their DNA degrade slightly with each division so that
by the time they reach their 52nd division, the ends are
completely gone; however, one
