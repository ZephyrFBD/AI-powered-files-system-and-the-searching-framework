TP synthase via chemiosmosis to form
molecules of ATP, which are used for the formation of sugar molecules in the second stage of photosynthesis. Photosystem
I absorbs a second photon, which results in the formation of an NADPH molecule, another energy and reducing power
carrier for the light-independent reactions.
8.3 Using Light to Make Organic Molecules
Using the energy carriers formed in the first steps of photosynthesis, the light-independent reactions, or the Calvin cycle,
take in CO2 from the environment. An enzyme, RuBisCO, catalyzes a reaction with CO2 and another molecule, RuBP.

After three cycles, a three-carbon molecule of G3P leaves the cycle to become part of a carbohydrate molecule. The
remaining G3P molecules stay in the cycle to be regenerated into RuBP, which is then ready to react with more CO2.
Photosynthesis forms an energy cycle with the process of cellul
