 reaction that combines glucose and fructose to form sucrose requires approximately 27 kilojoules of energy
per mole of sucrose formed:
Coupling these two reactions together shows that the exergonic breakdown of ATP into ADP releases more than
enough energy to power the formation of sucrose from glucose and fructose:
Many of the endergonic chemical reactions that are required by living systems are powered by coupling them
with exergonic reactions, such as the breakdown of ATP.

Catalase, an enzyme found in aerobic organisms, catalyzes the following reaction:
A filter paper disk is saturated with the enzyme catalase and then placed at the bottom of a beaker of H2O2. As
the reaction proceeds, oxygen bubbles will cling to the paper and eventually the paper will float to the top of the
liquid. By measuring the time it takes for the catalase-saturated disk to float, one can compare the relative rates of
decomposition of H2O2 under different ex
