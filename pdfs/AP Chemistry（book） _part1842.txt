the unit cells are arranged is called a 
crystal lattice. The crystal lattice is, in effect, an abstract (that is, not real) scaffold-
ing for the crystal structure. We can imagine forming the entire crystal structure by first 
building the scaffolding and then filling in each unit cell with the same atom or group 
of atoms.
Before describing the structures of solids, we need to understand the properties of 
crystal lattices. It is useful to begin with two-dimensional lattices because they are sim-
pler to visualize than three-dimensional ones. Figure 12.3 shows a two-dimensional array 
of lattice points. Each lattice point has an identical environment. The positions of the 
lattice points are defined by the lattice vectors a and b. Beginning from any lattice 
point, it is possible to move to any other lattice point by adding together whole-number 
multiples of the two lattice vectors.*
The parallelogram formed by the lattice vectors, the shaded region in Figure 12.3, 
defines the unit
