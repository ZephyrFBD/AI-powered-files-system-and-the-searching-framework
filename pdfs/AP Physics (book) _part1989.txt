spring-loaded metal rod drops down over
the end of the bimetallic strip (c) and the
circuit opens at the contact points (one is
attached to the rod) and the outside switch 
is also flipped. When the bimetallic strip
cools, it can be reset using the outside switch.
Better magnetic-type circuit breakers are
discussed in Chapters 20 and 21.
Household circuits are designed with the various devices connected so that
each receives the standard voltage (Fig. 18–20) from the electric company (usually
120 V in the United States). Circuits with the devices arranged as in Fig. 18–20
are called parallel circuits, as we will discuss in the next Chapter. When a fuse
blows or circuit breaker opens, it is important to check the total current being
drawn on that circuit, which is the sum of the currents in each device.
If the circuit in Fig. 18–20 is designed for a 20-A fuse, the fuse should blow,
and we hope it will, to prevent overloaded wires from getting hot enough to start
a fire. Something will h
