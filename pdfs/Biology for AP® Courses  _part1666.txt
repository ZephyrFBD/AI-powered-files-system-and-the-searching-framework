' Capping
While the pre-mRNA is still being synthesized, a 7-methylguanosine cap is added to the 5' end of the growing transcript
by a phosphate linkage. This moiety (functional group) protects the nascent mRNA from degradation. In addition, factors
involved in protein synthesis recognize the cap to help initiate translation by ribosomes.
3' Poly-A Tail
Once elongation is complete, the pre-mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease between an AAUAAA consensus sequence and
a GU-rich sequence, leaving the AAUAAA sequence on the pre-mRNA. An enzyme called poly-A polymerase then adds
a string of approximately 200 A residues, called the poly-A tail. This modification further protects the pre-mRNA from
degradation and signals the export of the cellular factors that the transcript needs to the cytoplasm.
Pre-mRNA Splicing
Eukaryotic genes are composed of exons, which correspond to protein-coding sequences (ex-on signifies that they are
expressed), and intervening sequences called introns (int-ron den
