3.2 Trigonometric Functions 
3.2.1 Trigonometric Functions 
A function is a rule that assigns to each real number another real number.  
In this section we use properties of the unit circle to define the trigonometric functions. 
We know that to find the terminal point P(x, y) for a given real number t, we move a 
distance |t| along the unit circle, starting at the point (1, 0). 
We move in a counterclockwise direction if t is positive and in a clockwise direction if t is 
negative. 
 
DEFINITION  
Let t be any real number and let P (x, y) be the terminal point on the unit circle determined 
by t. We define 
 
Because the trigonometric functions can be defined in terms of the unit circle, they are 
sometimes called the circular functions. 
 
Example 1 
Find the six trigonometric functions of each given real number t.
