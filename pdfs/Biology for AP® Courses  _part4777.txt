 the introduction of modern
factory trawlers in the 1980s and the pressure on the fishery led to it becoming unsustainable. The causes of fishery collapse
are both economic and political in nature. Most fisheries are managed as a common (shared) resource even when the fishing
territory lies within a countryâ€™s territorial waters. Common resources are subject to an economic pressure known as the
tragedy of the commons in which essentially no fisher has a motivation to exercise restraint in harvesting a fishery when

large fisheries are regulated to attempt to avoid this pressure, it still exists in the background. This overexploitation is
exacerbated when access to the fishery is open and unregulated and when technology gives fishers the ability to overfish.
In a few fisheries, the biological growth of the resource is less than the potential growth of the profits ma
