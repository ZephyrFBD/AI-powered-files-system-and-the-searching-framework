According to the data, prior to the drought, there were more green beetles than
brown beetles. The reason may be because brown beetles against green grass
are more easily spotted by predators. The drought may cause the grass to dry
up, which could result in the green beetles to be more easily spotted than the
brown beetles by predators. Thus, the rate of reproduction for the brown
beetles would be higher than that of the green beetles. This would shift the
frequencies of green and brown beetles such that the frequency of the brown
beetles would be higher than that of the green ones.
The frequencies of the brown and green beetles will change; the frequency for brown beetles
will be higher
The drought dried up the grass, exposing the green beetles to predators and in turn lowering
their reproduction rate
