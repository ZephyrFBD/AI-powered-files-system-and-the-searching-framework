Activity
Don’t Eat the Fugu: Understanding the Neuron. Create a model of a neuron to explain how the vertebrate
nervous system detects signals and transmits information. Then use the model to predict how abnormal cell
structure, drugs, and toxins (such as tetrodotoxin found in fugu/pufferfish) can affect impulse transmission.
Think About It
Potassium channel blockers, such as procainamide, are often used to treat abnormal activity in the heart. These
channel blocks impede the movement of K+ through voltage-gated K+ channels. What is the likely effect(s) of these
medications on action potentials?
