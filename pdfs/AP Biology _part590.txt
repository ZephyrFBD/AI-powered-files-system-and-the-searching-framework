“Helper” scrub jays that have not mated and have no territory of
their own often assist mated pairs in food gathering and raising their
offspring. Which of the following statements best explains how this
behavior fits into the theory of natural selection?
This behavior can be explained by genetic drift and is not
supported by the theory of natural selection.
The “helper” birds can increase their own reproductive success
by helping relatives who share some of their same genes.
The “helper” birds have a common genetic mutation that
directs this behavior, even though it decreases their own

Natural selection will select against these “helper” birds, and

Groundhogs are solitary animals that prefer to live in transitional
areas where forests meet well-vegetated open fields; these are the
areas where they can spot potential predators. They ar
