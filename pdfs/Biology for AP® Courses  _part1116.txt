s form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the
beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a DNA double helix. The next level of compaction
occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker DNA between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. This coiling further
shortens the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form. In the third level of packing,
a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin. These fibrous proteins also ensure that each chromosome in a
non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with that of any other chromosome (see the
top image in Figure 10.3).

Figure 10.4 Double-stranded DNA wraps around histone proteins to form nucleosomes that have the appearance of
“beads on a string.” The nucleosomes are coiled int
