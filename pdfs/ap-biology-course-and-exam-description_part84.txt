SYI-1.D
Describe the structure and/
or function of subcellular 
components and organelles.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SYI-1.D.1
Ribosomes comprise ribosomal RNA (rRNA) 
and protein. Ribosomes synthesize protein 
according to mRNA sequence.
SYI-1.D.2
Ribosomes are found in all forms of life, reflecting 
the common ancestry of all known life.
SYI-1.D.3
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) occurs in two 
forms—smooth and rough. Rough ER is 
associated with membrane-bound ribosomes—
a. Rough ER compartmentalizes the cell.
b. Smooth ER functions include detoxification 
and lipid synthesis.

SYI-1.D.4
The Golgi complex is a membrane-bound 
structure that consists of a series of flattened 
membrane sacs—
a. Functions of the Golgi include the correct 
folding and chemical modification of newly 
synthesized proteins and packaging for 
protein trafficking.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
