lecules and subsequently water to be released from
intestinal cells into the lumen.
(B)
Unpaired hemichannels open to actively transport water against its
concentration gradient from the intestinal cells into the lumen.
(C)
The passive transport of small molecules and ions via open
unpaired hemichannels from the lumen to intestinal cells draws
water into the lumen via osmosis.
(D)
47. Stenospermocarpic seedlessness in grapes is caused by a point mutation
(a change of only one nucleotide base in DNA or RNA) in a section of the
chromosome responsible for seed development. Fertilization occurs, and
seeds begin to develop but fail to fully mature. Grape breeders will
remove these developing seeds before they die and grow them into
plants by using tissue culture techniques.
Which statement gives the most likely reason the breeders are harvesting
and growing these immature seeds?
Harvesting immature seeds and growing them outside of the
original plant enable the seed to fully develop and gro
