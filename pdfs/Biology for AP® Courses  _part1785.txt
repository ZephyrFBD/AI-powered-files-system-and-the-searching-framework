Alternative RNA Splicing
In the 1970s, genes were first observed that exhibited alternative RNA splicing. Alternative RNA splicing is a
mechanism that allows different protein products to be produced from one gene when different combinations
of introns, and sometimes exons, are removed from the transcript (Figure 16.12). This alternative splicing
can be haphazard, but more often it is controlled and acts as a mechanism of gene regulation, with the
frequency of different splicing alternatives controlled by the cell as a way to control the production of
different protein products in different cells or at different stages of development. Alternative splicing is now
understood to be a common mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes; according to one estimate, 70
percent of genes in humans are expressed as multiple proteins through alternative splicing.
Figure 16.12 There are five basic modes of alternative splicing.
