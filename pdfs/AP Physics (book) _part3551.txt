We start with the great machines that accelerate
particles so they can collide at high energies.

In this penultimate Chapter we discuss elementary particle physics, which
represents the human endeavor to understand the basic building blocks of all
matter, and the fundamental forces that govern their interactions.
Almost a century ago, by the 1930s, it was accepted that all atoms can be
considered to be made up of neutrons, protons, and electrons. The basic constitu-
ents of the universe were no longer considered to be atoms (as they had been 
for 2000 years) but rather the proton, neutron, and electron. Besides these three
“elementary particles,” several others were also known: the positron (a positive
electron), the neutrino, and the particle (or photon), for a total of six elementary
particles.
By the 1950s and 1960s many
