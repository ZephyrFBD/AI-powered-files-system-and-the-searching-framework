he number of micrograms of 
solute. Because 1 mg is 1 * 10-6 g, 5.4 mg = 5.4 * 10-6 g.
Plan We calculate the parts per million using Equation 13.6.
Solve ppm = mass of solute
mass of soln
* 106
 
  =
5.4 * 10-6 g
2.5 g
* 106 = 2.2 ppm

ing 1.50 g of NaCl in 50.0 g of water. 
(a) 0.0291% (b) 0.0300% (c) 0.0513% (d) 2.91% (e) 3.00%
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
A commercial bleaching solution contains 3.62% by mass of 
sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl. What is the mass of NaOCl in a 
bottle containing 2.50 kg of bleaching solution?

CHAPTER 13 Properties of Solutions
The molality of a given solution does not vary with temperature because masses do 
not vary with temperature. The molarity of the solution does change with temperature, 
however, because the volume of the solution expands or contracts with temperature. 
Thus, molality is often the concentration u
