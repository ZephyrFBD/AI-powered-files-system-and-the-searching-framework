A photoperiod, or specific length of daylight, may be a required germination stimulus for some seeds (see
“Photoperiodism and Flowering,” below).
Scarification, or cuts or damage to the seed coat, is required by some seeds before water absorption can begin. Such
scarification occurs naturally if seeds are typically roughed up by running rainwater, rivers, or the digestive tracts of
animals.
Gibberellins, a class of plant hormones, are instrumental in activating germination. During the initial stages of
germination, gibberellins, produced by the embryo, bind to DNA and release transcription factors. These
transcription factors activate genes that produce enzymes necessary for germination. Included among these is a-
amylase, an enzyme that contributes to the breakdown of carbohydrates in stored food.
Photoperiodism and Flowering
Photoperiodism is the response of plants to changes in the photoperiod, or the relative length of daylight and night.
