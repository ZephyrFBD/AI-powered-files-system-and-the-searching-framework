he evolution of a population.
Speciation
A species is usually defined as a group of individuals capable of interbreeding. Speciation, the formation of new
species, occurs by the following processes, as illustrated in Figure 10-2:
1. Allopatric speciation begins when a population is divided by a geographic barrier so that interbreeding between
the two resulting populations is prevented. Common barriers include mountain ranges or rivers, but any region that
excludes vital resources, such as a region devoid of water, a burned area devoid of food, or an area covered with
volcanic lava, can act as a barrier because individuals cannot survive its crossing. Once reproductively isolated by
the barrier, gene frequencies in the two populations can diverge due to natural selection (the environments may be
slightly different), mutation, or genetic drift. If the gene pools sufficiently diverge, then interbreeding between the
populations will not occur if the geographic barrier is removed. Instead,
