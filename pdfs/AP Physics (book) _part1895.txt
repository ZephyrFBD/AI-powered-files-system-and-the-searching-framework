the more electrons are repelled and fewer
pass through, producing a less bright spot on the screen. Thus the varying grid
voltage is responsible for the brightness of each spot on the screen. At the end of
each horizontal sweep of the electron beam, the horizontal deflection voltage
changes dramatically to bring the beam back to the opposite side of the screen,
and the vertical voltage changes slightly so the beam begins a new horizontal
sweep slightly below the previous one. The difference in brightness of the spots on
the screen forms the “picture.” Color screens have red, green, and blue phosphors
which glow when struck by the electron beam. The various brightnesses of adjacent
red, green, and blue phosphors (so close together we don’t distinguish them)
produce almost any color. Analog TV for the U.S. provided 480 visible horizontal
sweeps† to form a complete picture every

every second (25 in countries with 50-Hz line voltage), a “moving picture”is d
