 16.106  What is the pH of a solution that is 2.5 * 10-9 M in NaOH? 
Does your answer make sense? What assumption do we 
normally make that is not valid in this case?
 16.107  Oxalic acid 1H2C2O42 is a diprotic acid. By using data in 
Appendix D as needed, determine whether each of the 
following statements is true: (a) H2C2O4 can serve as both 
a Brønsted–Lowry acid and a Brønsted–Lowry base. (b) 
C2O4
2- is the conjugate base of HC2O4
-. (c) An aqueous 
solution of the strong electrolyte KHC2O4 will have pH 6 7.
 16.108  Succinic acid 1H2C4H6O42, which we will denote H2Suc, 
is a biologically relevant diprotic acid with the structure 
shown below. At 25 °C, the acid-dissociation constants for 
succinic acid are Ka1 = 6.9 * 10-5 and Ka2 = 2.5 * 10-6. 
(a) Determine the pH of a 0.32 M solution of H2Suc at 
25 °C, assuming that only the first dissociation is relevant. 
(b) Determine the molar concentration of Suc2 -  in the 
solution in part (a). (c) Is the ass
