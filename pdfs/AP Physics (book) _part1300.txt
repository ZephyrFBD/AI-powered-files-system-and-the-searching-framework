 the distance between two successive
nodes, or between two successive antinodes, is 
there is one-half of a wave-
length within the length of the tube for the simplest case of the fundamental (top
diagram in Fig. 12–11a):
or
So the fundamental frequency is
where v is the velocity of sound in air (the air in the tube). The
standing wave with two nodes is the first overtone or second harmonic and has
half the wavelength
and twice the frequency of the fundamental. Indeed,
in a uniform tube open at both ends, the frequency of each overtone is an integral
multiple of the fundamental frequency, as shown in Fig. 12–11a. This is just what
is found for a string.
