he pure substances are P°
ben = 75 torr and P°
tol = 22 torr. 
Thus, the partial pressures above the solution are
P
ben = 10.332175 torr2 = 25 torr
P
tol = 10.672122 torr2 = 15 torr
and the total vapor pressure above the liquid is
P
total = P
ben + P
tol = 25 torr + 15 torr = 40 torr
Note that the vapor is richer in benzene, the more volatile 
 
component.
The mole fraction of benzene in the vapor is given by the 
ratio of its vapor pressure to the total pressure (Equations 10.14 
and 10.15):
Xben in vapor =

40 torr = 0.63
Although benzene constitutes only 33% of the molecules in the 
solution, it makes up 63% of the molecules in the vapor.
When an ideal liquid solution containing two volatile com-
ponents is in equilibrium with its vapor, the more volatile com-
ponent will be relatively richer in the vapor. This fact forms the 
basis of distillation, a technique used to separate (or partially sep-
arate) mixtures containing volatile components.
