ion to others. Cytokines also increase the core body temperature, causing
a fever, which causes the liver to withhold iron from the blood. Without iron, certain pathogens, such as some bacteria, are
unable to replicate; this is called nutritional immunity.
Watch this 23-second stop-motion video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/conidia) showing a neutrophil that searches for
and engulfs fungus spores during an elapsed time of about 79 minutes.
How does the action shown in the video clip (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/conidia (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
conidia) ) demonstrate an immune response?
a.
Neutrophils phagocytize pathogens invading the body and release chemical histamines that cause pathogen
destruction and removal from the body. This prevents pathogens from producing toxic compounds that harm
cells.
b.
Neutrophils phagocytize pathogens invading the body, resulting in their death and removal from the body.
This prevents pathogens from multiplying or producing toxic compounds that
