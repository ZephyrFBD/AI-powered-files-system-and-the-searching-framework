ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
EVO-1.L.1
Changes in allele frequencies provide evidence 
for the occurrence of evolution in a population.
EVO-1.L.2
Small populations are more susceptible 
to random environmental impact than 
large populations.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
EVO-1.L
Explain the impacts on 
the population if any of 
the conditions of Hardy-
Weinberg are not met.
