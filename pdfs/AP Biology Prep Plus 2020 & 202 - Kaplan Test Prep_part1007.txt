 genes, three classes of genes (A, B, and C) are responsible
for the spatial pattern of floral parts. Sepals develop from the
region where only A genes are active. Petals develop where both A
and B genes are expressed. Stamens arise where B and C genes
are active and carpels arise where only C genes are expressed.
Furthermore, it is observed that if A-gene or C-gene activity is
missing, then the activity of the other spreads throughout.
Which of the following could be the floral morphology for a
mutant lacking C-gene activity?
Sepal-petal-stamen-carpel-stamen-petal-sepal
(A)
Carpel-stamen-carpel-stamen-carpel
(B)
Sepal-carpel-sepal
(C)
Sepal-petal-sepal-petal-sepal 
(D)
