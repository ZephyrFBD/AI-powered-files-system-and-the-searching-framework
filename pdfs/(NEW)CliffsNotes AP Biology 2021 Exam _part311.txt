 syndrome phenotype, which consists of physical abnormalities and mental
retardation.
f. Turner syndrome results from a nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes. This results in a gamete that has either
two sex chromosomes or no sex chromosomes. If a gamete with no sex chromosomes (O) fuses with a normal
gamete bearing the X chromosome, the resulting zygote will have only a single X chromosome (XO) and express
the Turner syndrome phenotype. Turner syndrome individuals are female and exhibit physical abnormalities,
including sterility.
Molecular Biology
Review
Chromosomes bear the genetic information that is passed from parents to offspring. The genetic information is
stored in molecules of DNA. The DNA is used to make RNA, and RNA assembles amino acids into proteins. Some
proteins form the basic structure and appearance of cells, while other proteins, those that function as enzymes,
regulate chemical reactions that direct metabolism for cell development, growth, and maintenance. Following
