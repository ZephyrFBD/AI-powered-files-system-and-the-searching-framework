Introduction
Some of the greatest accomplishments of biotechnology are in the fields of medicine and medical research. For example,
intestinal failure due to missing or abnormal intestinal tissue is a frequent problem in premature babies. Intestinal problems
are also common for people who have had parts of their small intestines removed for reasons , such as Crohnâ€™s Disease,
cancer, and blockages. Complications from intestinal failure may include liver disease, bacterial overgrowth, dehydration,
and malnutrition.
Scientists have recently developed a way to engineer human intestines from human cells using mice. Using a mixture of
healthy mouse and human intestinal cells and placing it on scaffolding in the abdominal cavity of immunocompromised
mice, functional human intestinal cells grow within four weeks. This could be the breakthrough needed to help patients
suffering from intestinal failure. More details about this exc
