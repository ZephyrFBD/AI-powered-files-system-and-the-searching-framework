CELLULAR RESPIRATION*
What factors affect the rate of cellular respiration in 
multicellular organisms?
 
â– BACKGROUND
Living systems require free energy and matter to maintain order, to grow, and to 
reproduce. Energy deficiencies are not only detrimental to individual organisms, but 
they cause disruptions at the population and ecosystem levels as well. Organisms employ 
various strategies that have been conserved through evolution to capture, use, and store 
free energy. Autotrophic organisms capture free energy from the environment through 
photosynthesis and chemosynthesis, whereas he
