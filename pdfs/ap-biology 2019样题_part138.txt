of the signaling pathway.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-3.G.1
Changes in signal transduction pathways can 
alter cellular response—
a.  
Mutations in any domain of the receptor 
protein or in any component of the signaling 
pathway may affect the downstream 
components by altering the subsequent 
transduction of the signal.
IST-3.G.2
Chemicals that interfere with any component 
of the signaling pathway may activate or inhibit 
the pathway.

Feedback
ENE-3.B
Explain how negative 
feedback helps to maintain 
homeostasis.
ENE-3.C
Explain how positive 
feedback affects 
homeostasis.
ENE-3.B.1
Negative feedback mechanisms maintain 
homeostasis for a particular condition by 
regulating physiological processes. If a system 
is perturbed, negative feedback mechanisms 
return the system back to its target set point.
