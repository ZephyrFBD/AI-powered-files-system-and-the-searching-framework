at are identical copies of the parent cell
maintaining the proper number of chromosomes from generation to generation
The impetus to divide occurs because an organism needs to grow, a tissue needs repair, or asexual reproduction must
take place. For our purposes, we can say that mitosis occurs in just about every cell except sex cells. When you think
of mitosis, remember: “Like begets like.” Hair cells “beget” other hair cells, skin cells “beget” other skin cells, and
so on. Mitosis is involved in growth, repair, and asexual reproduction.
