 molecules that allow communication with another cell
(also signaling cascade) chain of events that occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell to propagate the
signal from the plasma membrane to produce a response
chemical signal (neurotransmitter) that travels between nerve cells
cell that has a receptor for a signal or ligand from a signaling cell
CHAPTER SUMMARY
9.1 Signaling Molecules and Cellular Receptors
Cells communicate by both inter- and intracellular signaling. Signaling cells secrete ligands that bind to target cells and
initiate a chain of events within the target cell. The four categories of signaling in multicellular organisms are paracrine
signaling, endocrine signaling, autocrine signaling, and direct signaling across gap junctions. Paracrine signaling takes
place over short distances. Endocrine signals are carried long distances through the bloodstream by hormones, and
autocrine signals are received by the same cell that sent the signal or other nearby cells of the same kind
