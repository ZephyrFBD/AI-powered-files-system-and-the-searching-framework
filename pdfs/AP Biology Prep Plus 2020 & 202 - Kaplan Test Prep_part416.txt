 the surface is ET50, the estimated time for 50 percent of the
disks to rise. This measurement will help you to aggregate your data for
the second half of the investigation.
Aȇer learning how to use the floating disk procedure, you will choose one
factor that aﬀects the rate of photosynthesis and then develop and
conduct an investigation of that variable. When you compare the ET50 for
diﬀerent levels of your chosen variable, you should observe that ET50
goes down as rate of photosynthesis goes up. This creates a
nontraditional graph that is not the best display of your data (below leȇ).
Alternatively, you can use 1/ET50, which will show increasing rates of
photosynthesis and, therefore, a graph with a positive slope (below
right).
AP Biology Lab 6: Cellular
Respiration Investigation
This investigation is much more about the experimental method than
about cellular respiration. In this investigation, you learn how to set up
and use a respirometer to measure the change in volume of a gas,
