17–7 Capacitance
A capacitor is a device that can store electric charge, and normally consists of two
conducting objects (usually plates or sheets) placed near each other but not
touching. Capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits and sometimes are
called condensers. Capacitors store charge for later use, such as in a camera flash,
and as energy backup in devices like computers if the power fails. Capacitors 
also block surges of charge and energy to protect circuits. Very tiny capacitors
serve as memory for the “ones” and “zeros” of the binary code in the random
access memory (RAM) of computers and other electronic devices (as in
Fig. 17–35). Capacitors serve many other applications as well, some of which we
will discuss.
A simple capacitor consists of a pair of parallel plat
