activity. Many of the large molecules in living systems are polymers 
 (Section 12.8) of 
much smaller molecules. These biopolymers can be classified into three broad categories: 
proteins, polysaccharides (carbohydrates), and nucleic acids. Lipids are another common 
class of molecules in living systems, but they are usually large molecules, not biopolymers.
24.7 ∣ Proteins
Proteins are macromolecules present in all living cells. About 50% of your body’s dry 
mass is protein. Some proteins are structural components in animal tissues; they are a 
key part of skin, nails, cartilage, and muscles. Other proteins catalyze reactions, trans-
port oxygen, serve as hormones to regulate specific body processes, and perform other 
tasks. Whatever their function, all proteins are chemically similar, being composed of 
smaller molecules called amino acids.
Amino Acids
An amino acid is a molecule containing an amine group, ¬NH2, and a carboxylic 
acid group, ¬COOH. The building blocks of all pr
