oint in the system to a more healthy level. This is called a process
of alteration of the set point in a feedback loop.
Changes can be made in a group of body organ systems in order to maintain a set point in another system. This is called
acclimatization. This occurs, for instance, when an animal migrates to a higher altitude than it is accustomed to. In order
to adjust to the lower oxygen levels at the new altitude, the body increases the number of red blood cells circulating in the

blood to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues. Another example of acclimatization is animals that have seasonal
changes in their coats: a heavier coat in the winter ensures adequate heat retention, and a light coat in summer assists in
keeping body temperature from rising to harmful levels.
Feedback mechanisms can be understood in terms of driving a race car
