SECTION 7–5
Elastic Collisions in One Dimension

C A U T I O N
Relative speeds (one dimension only)
We can rewrite this equation as
or
[head-on (1-D) elastic collision] (7;7)
This is an interesting result: it tells us that for any elastic head-on collision, the
relative speed of the two objects after the collision  
has the same magnitude
(but opposite direction) as before the collision, no matter what the masses are.
Equation 7–7 was derived from conservation of kinetic energy for elastic 
collisions, and can be used in place of it. Because the v’s are not squared in
Eq. 7–7, it is simpler to use in calculations than the conservation of kinetic 
energy equation (Eq. 7–6) directly.
