the electric-field vector of the light is confined to a single plane 
 
(Figure 23.23). If the polarized light is then passed through a solution containing one 
optical isomer, the plane of polarization is rotated either to the right or to the left. 
The isomer that rotates the plane of polarization to the right is dextrorotatory; it 
is the dextro, or d, isomer (Latin dexter, “right”). Its mirror image rotates the plane of 
polarization to the left; it is levorotatory and is the levo, or l, isomer (Latin laevus, 
“left”). The 3Co(en)343 +  isomer on the right in Figure 23.22 is found experimentally 
to be the l isomer of this ion. Its mirror image is the d isomer. Because of their effect 
on plane-polarized light, chiral molecules are said to be optically active.

Does either cis-3Co(en)2Cl24+ or trans@3Co(en)2Cl24- have optical isomers?
Solve
 The trans isomer of 3Co(en)2Cl24+ and its mirror image are shown 
here. Notice th
