for this puck? What would your answer be if the puck slowed down?
RESPONSE Did you choose (a)? If so, can you answer the question: what
exerts the horizontal force labeled 
on the puck? If you say that it is the force
needed to maintain the motion, ask yourself: what exerts this force? Remember
that another object must exert any force—and there simply isn’t any possibility
here. Therefore, (a) is wrong. Besides, the force 
in Fig. 4–20a would give rise to
an acceleration by Newton’s second law. It is (b) that is correct. No net force
acts on the puck, and the puck slides at constant velocity across the ice.
In the real world, where even smooth ice exerts at least a tiny friction force,
then (c) is the correct answer. The tiny friction force is in the direction opposite
to the motion, and the puck’s velocity decreases, even if very slowly.
