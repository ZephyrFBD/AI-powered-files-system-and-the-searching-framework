 are the only two possible alleles for a given trait in the population,
these genotypes frequencies will sum to one: p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1.

Figure 19.2 When populations are in the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the allelic frequency is stable from
generation to generation and the distribution of alleles can be determined from the Hardy–Weinberg equation. If
the allelic frequency measured in the field differs from the predicted value, scientists can make inferences about
what evolutionary forces are at play.
In plants, violet flower color (V) is dominant over white (v). If p = 0.8 and q = 0.2 in a population of 500 plants,
how many individuals would you expect to be homozygous dominant (VV), heterozygous (Vv), and homozygous
recessive (vv)? How many plants would you expect to have violet flowers, and how many would have white flowers?
a.
homozygous dominant: 320 heterozygous: 160 homozygous recessive: 20 violet: 480 white: 20
b.
homozygous dominant
