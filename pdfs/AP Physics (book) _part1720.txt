but the sum of the two is zero.
This is an example of a law that is now well established: the law of conservation
of electric charge, which states that
the net amount of electric charge produced in any process is zero;
or, said another way,
no net electric charge can be created or destroyed.
If one object (or a region of space) acquires a positive charge, then an equal
amount of negative charge will be found in neighboring areas or objects. No
violations have ever been found, and the law of conservation of electric charge is
as firmly established as those for energy and momentum.
