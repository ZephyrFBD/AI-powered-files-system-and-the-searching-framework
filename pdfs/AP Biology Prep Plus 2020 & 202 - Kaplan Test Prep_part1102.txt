d, there is a noticeable decrease in
the population of Group 1 lemurs. What could explain the decline in the
Group 1 lemur population?
The population of Group 2 lemurs increased substantially due to the
increase in food availability and outcompeted Group 1 lemurs.
(A)
The increase in food availability caused Group 2 lemurs to become
overweight and slower, which led to more being eaten by predators.
(B)
Group 1 and Group 2 began to integrate with each other due to no
longer needing to compete for food.
(C)
 A third group of lemurs that used to exclusively eat leaves begins to
eat half of all the available fruit.
(D)
33. The lemurs live in a place where every winter, clouds cover the sky for
two months and severely limit the amount of available sunlight. How
would this aﬀect the lemurs?
The lemurs would not be aﬀected because they would eat mostly
insects instead.
(A)
Less light would lead to less plant growth, meaning both lemur
populations would stagnate or decline during the winter.
