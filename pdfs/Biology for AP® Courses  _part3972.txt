. This process primes, or sensitizes, the tissue. Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen, IgE
molecules on mast cells bind the antigen via their variable domains and stimulate the mast cell to release the modified amino
acids histamine and serotonin; these chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils which mediate allergic responses. Figure
33.27 shows an example of an allergic response to ragweed pollen. The effects of an allergic reaction range from mild
symptoms like sneezing and itchy, watery eyes to more severe or even life-threatening reactions involving intensely itchy
welts or hives, airway contraction with severe respiratory distress, and plummeting blood pressure. This extreme reaction
is known as anaphylactic shock. If not treated with epinephrine to counter the blood pressure and breathing effects, this
condition can be fatal.
