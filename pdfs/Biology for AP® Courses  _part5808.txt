hearing such comments from the non-‘vaccinated’ describing
behaviour changes in friends, loved ones and work colleagues. This
will only increase as the self-replicating synthetic material and
nanoparticles expand in body and brain. An article in the Guardian in
2016 detailed research at the University of Virginia in CharloĴesville
which developed a new method for controlling brain circuits
associated with complex animal behaviour. The method, dubbed
‘magnetogenetics’, involves genetically-engineering a protein called
ferritin, which stores and releases iron, to create a magnetised
substance – ‘Magneto’ – that can activate speciﬁc groups of nerve
cells from a distance. This is claimed to be an advance on other
methods of brain activity manipulation known as optogenetics and
chemogenetics (the Cult has been developing methods of brain
control for a long time). The ferritin technique is said to be non-
invasive and able to activate neurons ‘rapidly and reversibly’. In
other words, huma
