artifact.
 21.43  Potassium-40 decays to argon-40 with a half-life of 
1.27 * 109 yr. What is the age of a rock in which the mass 
ratio of 40Ar to 40K is 4.2?
 21.44  The half-life for the process 238U ¡ 206Pb is 4.5 * 109 yr. 
A mineral sample contains 75.0 mg of 238U and 18.0 mg of 
206Pb. What is the age of the mineral?
Energy Changes in Nuclear Reactions  
(Section 21.6)
 21.45  An analytical laboratory balance typically measures mass 
to the nearest 0.1 mg. What energy change would accom-
pany the loss of 0.1 mg in mass?
 21.46  The thermite reaction, Fe2O31s2 + 2 Al1s2 ¡ 2 Fe1s2 +
Al2O31s2, ∆H° = -851.5 kJ>mol, is one of the most exo-
thermic reactions known. Because the heat released is 
sufficient to melt the iron product, the reaction is used to 
weld metal under the ocean. How much heat is released per 
mole of Al2O3 produced? How does this amount of thermal 
energy compare with the energy released when 2 mol of 
protons and 2 mol of
