Problem 90.
96. A 175-pF capacitor is connected in series with an unknown
capacitor, and as a series combination they are connected
to a 25.0-V battery. If the 175-pF capacitor stores 125 pC
of charge on its plates, what is the unknown capacitance?
97. In the circuit shown in Fig.19–93,
and a voltage
is applied across
points a and b. After 
is fully charged, the switch is thrown
to the right. What is the final charge and potential differ-
ence on each capacitor?
