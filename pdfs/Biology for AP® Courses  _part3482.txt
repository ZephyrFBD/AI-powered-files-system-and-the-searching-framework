es vitamins D, C, and A, plus minerals such as calcium, phosphorous, and magnesium. Hormones such as parathyroid
hormone, growth hormone, and calcitonin are also required for proper bone growth and maintenance.
Bone turnover rates are quite high, with five to seven percent of bone mass being recycled every week. Differences in
turnover rate exist in different areas of the skeleton and in different areas of a bone. For example, the bone in the head of
the femur may be fully replaced every six months, whereas the bone along the shaft is altered much more slowly.
Bone remodeling allows bones to adapt to stresses by becoming thicker and stronger when subjected to stress. Bones that
are not subject to normal stress, for example when a limb is in a cast, will begin to lose mass. A fractured or broken bone
undergoes repair through four stages:
1.
Blood vessels in the broken bone tear and hemorrhage, resulting in the formation of clotted blood, or a hematoma, at
the site of the break. The seve
