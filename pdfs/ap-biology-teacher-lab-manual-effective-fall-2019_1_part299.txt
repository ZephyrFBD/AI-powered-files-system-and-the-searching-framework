 cells, such as plant cells, control their internal pressure using 
the central vacuole. They will need help comprehending how solutes reduce the free 
water in a system and therefore act to reduce the water potential. 
The terms hypotonic, hypertonic, and 
 isotonic are confusing until students realize 
that these are relative terms and refer to the solute concentration, rather than water

■ THE INVESTIGATIONS 
■ Getting Started: Prelab Assessment 
You may assign the following questions for homework; as a think, pair/group, share 
activity, in which pairs or small groups of students brainstorm ideas and then share them 
with other groups; or as a whole-class discussion to assess students’ understanding of key 
concepts pertaining to kinetic energy, osmosis, and diffusion: 
•  What is kinetic energy and
