s of the same sex, and still
others play roles in mother-infant attachment. Some pheromones can also influence the timing of puberty,
modify reproductive cycles, and even prevent embryonic implantation. While the roles of pheromones in
many nonhuman species are important, pheromones have become less important in human behavior over
evolutionary time compared to their importance to organisms with more limited behavioral repertoires.
The vomeronasal organ (VNO, or Jacobsonâ€™s organ) is a tubular, fluid-filled, olfactory organ present in many
vertebrate animals that sits adjacent to the nasal cavity. It is very sensitive to pheromones and is connected
to the nasal cavity by a duct. When molecules dissolve in the mucosa of the nasal cavity, they then enter
the VNO where the pheromone molecules among them bind with specialized pheromone receptors. Upon
exposure to pheromones from their own species or others, many animals, including cats, may display the
flehmen response (shown in Figure 27.9
