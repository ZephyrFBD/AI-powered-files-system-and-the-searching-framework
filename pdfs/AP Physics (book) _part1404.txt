Volume Expansion
The change in volume of a material which undergoes a temperature change is
given by a relation similar to Eq. 13–1a, namely,
(13;2)
where 
is the original volume,
is the change in volume when the tempera-
ture changes by 
, and 
is the coefficient of volume expansion. The units of 
are
Values of 
for various materials are given in Table 13–1. Notice that for
solids,
is normally equal to approximately 
Note also that linear expansion
has no meaning for liquids and gases because they do not have fixed shapes.
Equations 13–1 and 13–2 are accurate only if 
(or 
) is small compared
to 
(or 
). This is of particular concern for liquids and even more so for gases
because of the large values of 
Furthermore,
itself varies substantially with
temperature for gases. Therefore, a more convenient way of dealing with gases is
needed, and will be discussed starting in Section 13–5.
