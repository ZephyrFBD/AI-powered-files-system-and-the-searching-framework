f molecules would have kinetic energy 
greater than Ea than for the red curve. Figure 14.19 The rate of 
converting intermediates to products will be faster, because this 
reaction has a lower barrier than the reaction that converts interme-
diates back to reactants. Figure 14.20 No, because the bottleneck, 
or rate determining step, is passing through toll plaza A. Figure 
14.21 The color is characteristic of molecular bromine, Br2, which is 
an intermediate in this reaction. Figure 14.22 There is one valley 
corresponding to the formation of intermediates, so the reaction has 
a total of two steps. Figure 14.25 Grinding increases the surface 
area, exposing more of the catalase to react with the hydrogen per-
oxide. Figure 14.26 Substrates must be held more tightly so that 
they can undergo the desired reaction. Products are released from 
the active site.

Figure 15.2 The same because once the system reaches  
equilibrium the concentrations of NO2 and N2O4 stop changing.
