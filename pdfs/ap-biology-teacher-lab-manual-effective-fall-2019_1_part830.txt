 able to see that 80 mg of A are left in Process I; opposite Y you can see that 90 
mg of A are left in Process II. Apparently, Process I has used up 20 mg of A and Process 
II has used up only 10 mg in the same amount of time. Obviously, Process I is faster, and 
the line graph for Process I is steeper than the graph for Process II.

The rate for Process I is 20 mg A used/hr, while the rate for Process II is 10 mg A 
used/hr. 
We have seen that a steeper line graph means a faster reaction when the progress 
curves for two reactions are plotted on the same scale. (Obviously, if the progress curves 
are plotted on different scales, we cannot compare the steepness of the line directly, but 
have to calculate what the slope would be if the two curves were plotted on the same 
scale.) 
Suppose, now, that we make a new kind o
