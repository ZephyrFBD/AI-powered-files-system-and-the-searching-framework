s, these freshwater fish then became isolated from each other
in different lakes. Depending on which lake population was studied, findings showed that these sticklebacks
then either remained as one species or evolved into two species. The divergence of species was made
possible by their use of different areas of the pond for feeding called micro niches.
Dr. Harmon and his team created artificial pond microcosms in 250-gallon tanks and added muck from
freshwater ponds as a source of zooplankton and other invertebrates to sustain the fish. In different
experimental tanks they introduced one species of stickleback from either a single-species or double-
species lake.
Over time, the team observed that some of the tanks bloomed with algae while others did not. This puzzled
the scientists, and they decided to measure the water's dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which consists of
mostly large molecules of decaying organic matter that give pond-water its slightly brownish color. It turned
