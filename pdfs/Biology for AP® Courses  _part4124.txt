ation is tightly controlled to
ensure that only one sperm fuses with one egg. After fertilization, the zygote undergoes cleavage to form the blastula. The
blastula, which in some species is a hollow ball of cells, undergoes a process called gastrulation, in which the three germ
layers form. The ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system and the epidermal skin cells, the mesoderm gives rise to the
muscle cells and connective tissue in the body, and the endoderm gives rise to columnar cells and internal organs.
