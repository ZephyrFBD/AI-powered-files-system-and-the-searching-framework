cept. Suppose you read that 1 mol of 
nitrogen is produced in a particular reaction. You might interpret this statement to mean 
1 mol of nitrogen atoms (14.0 g). Unless otherwise stated, however, what is probably 
meant is 1 mol of nitrogen molecules, N2 (28.0 g), because N2 is the most common chem-
ical form of the element. To avoid ambiguity, it is important to state explicitly the chemi-
cal form being discussed. Using the chemical formula—N or N2, for instance—avoids any 
confusion.

▲ Figure 3.9 Comparing the mass of  
1 molecule and 1 mol of H2O. Both masses 
have the same number but different units 
(atomic mass units and grams). Expressing 
both masses in grams indicates their huge 
difference: 1 molecule of H2O has a mass  
of 2.99 * 10-23 g, whereas 1 mol H2O has 
a mass of 18.0 g.
