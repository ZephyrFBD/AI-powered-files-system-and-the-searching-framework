34.7 Human Pregnancy and Birth
Human pregnancy begins with fertilization of an egg and proceeds through the three trimesters of gestation. The labor
process has three stages (contractions, delivery of the fetus, expulsion of the placenta), each propelled by hormones. The
first trimester lays down the basic structures of the body, including the limb buds, heart, eyes, and the liver. The second
trimester continues the development of all of the organs and systems. The third trimester exhibits the greatest growth of
the fetus and culminates in labor and delivery. Prevention of a pregnancy can be accomplished through a variety of
methods including barriers, hormones, or other means. Assisted reproductive technologies may help individuals who have
infertility problems.
