ocess equals the heat added
to the gas.
Adiabatic Processes 
An adiabatic process is one in which no heat is allowed to flow into or out of the
system:
This situation can occur if the system is extremely well insulated,
or the process happens so quickly that heat—which flows slowly—has no time 
to flow in or out. The very rapid expansion of gases in an internal combustion
engine is one example of a process that is very nearly adiabatic. An adiabatic
expansion of an ideal gas done very slowly can be represented by a curve like
that labeled AC in Fig. 15–3. Since 
we have from Eq. 15–1 that
When a gas expands, it does work and W is positive, so the inter-
nal energy decreases; hence the temperature decreases as well (because
). This is seen in Fig. 15–3 where the product PV
is less
at point C than at point B. (Compare to curve AB for an isothermal process, in
which
and
) In the reverse operation, an adiabatic compression
(going from C to A, for example), work is done on the gas, and henc
