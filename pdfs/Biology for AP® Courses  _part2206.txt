tions are
becoming less similar among the population
b.
genetic drift, as the distribution of traits has
become more random
c.
gene flow, as the population has likely gained
new mouthpart traits through immigration
d.
natural selection, as insects that have mid-sized
mouthparts are being favored
33. A pond is stocked with 250 fish, all of the same
species. At that time, the researchers tested the fish to
determine if they were genetically predisposed to a certain
disease. The gene tested has two alleles, A and a. They
found that 58 of the fish possessed allele A, while the rest
of the fish possessed allele a. They plan to reassess the fish
5 years later. A computer model predicts that the
population will likely increase to 850 fish and have 403
heterozygote (Aa) individuals. Will the future population
have evolved? State how you know.
a.
Evolution has not occurred, because the
frequency of the heterozygotes is different 5
years later compared with the original
population.
b.
Evolution
