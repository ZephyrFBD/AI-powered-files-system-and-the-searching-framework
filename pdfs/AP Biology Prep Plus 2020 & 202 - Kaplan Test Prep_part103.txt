8. Farmers routinely use antibiotics to treat livestock in an attempt
to prevent and treat infections that arise due to overcrowding and
poor living conditions. One example of an antibiotic used since
1995 is ciprofloxacin in poultry production. However, studies have
have shown that overuse of antibiotics has led to antibiotic-
resistant bacteria. By 1999, about 20 percent of chicken breasts
tested by the FDA contained ciprofloxacin-resistant Camplobacter,
a bacterium known to cause diarrhoeal disease. By 2005, nearly 30
percent of the Camplobacter found in chicken breasts across the
United States were ciprofloxacin resistant. During that year,
hospitals reported that a»áer ciprofloxacin use, ciprofloxacin
resistance in Camplobacter populations occurred in weeks, rather
than months.
Which of the following statements best explains these
observations concerning ciprofloxacin resistance in
Camplobacter?
Natural selection favors ciprofloxacin-resistant Camplobacter
that were already in the
