and keep cold. Keep out 
of direct light because guaiacol is light 
sensitive. As long as the original stock 
bottle is kept in the refrigerator, it will 
last for years. 
•  Buffers: You can make your own 
phosphate buffers to fit the needs of 
your experiment, but for simplicity 
and storage, pHydrion buffers are 
recommended. A good range of buffers 
is pH 3 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 10. 
Other Supplies 
•  Laboratory notebook 
•  Distilled or deionized water 
•  Test tubes of approximately 16 x 150 
mm and appropriate test tube rack. Each 
student group will need approximately 
14 test tubes. 
•  Timer 
•  1, 5, and 10 mL graduated pipettes, 
pipette pumps, or syringes, probably as 
series of 1, 2, 5, and 10 mL. 
This laboratory investigation is designed to be performed without a spectrophotometer, 
but a spectrophotometer or probes with computer interface can be used.
