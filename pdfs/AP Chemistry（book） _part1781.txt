ttractions, and hydrogen bonding) limit the ability of 
the molecules to slide past one another.
In a cholesteric liquid crystal, the molecules are arranged in layers, with 
their long axes parallel to the other molecules within the same layer.* Upon moving 
from one layer to the next, the orientation of the molecules rotates by a fixed angle, 
resulting in a spiral pattern. These liquid crystals are so named because many deriva-
tives of cholesterol adopt this structure.
The molecular arrangement in cholesteric liquid crystals produces unusual col-
oring patterns with visible light. Changes in temperature and pressure change the 
order and, hence, the color. Cholesteric liquid crystals are used to monitor tem-
perature changes in situations where conventional methods are not feasible. For 
example, they can detect hot spots in microelectronic circuits, which may signal the 
presence of flaws. They can also be fashioned into thermometers for measuring the 
skin temperature of infants.
