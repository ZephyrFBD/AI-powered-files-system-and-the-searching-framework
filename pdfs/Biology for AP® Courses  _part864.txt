crease the enzyme’s activity. An increase in citrate concentration can occur because of a blockage in the citric acid cycle.
Fermentation, with its production of organic acids like lactic acid, frequently accounts for the increased acidity in a cell;
however, the products of fermentation do not typically accumulate in cells.
The last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase. The pyruvate produced can proceed to be catabolized or
converted into the amino acid alanine. If no more energy is needed and alanine is in adequate supply, the enzyme
is inhibited. The enzyme’s activity is increased when fructose-1,6-bisphosphate levels increase. (Recall that
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is an intermediate in the first half of glycolysis.) The regulation of pyruvate kinase involves
phosphorylation by a kinase (pyruvate kinase kinase), resulting in a less-active enzyme. Dephosphorylation by a
phosphatase reactivates it. Pyruvate kinase is also regulated by ATP (a negative allosteric effect).
