 and/or pressure can lead to conversion from one state 
of matter to another, illustrated by such familiar processes 
as ice melting or water vapor condensing.
Pure Substances
Most forms of matter we encounter—the air we breathe 
(a gas), the gasoline we burn in our cars (a liquid), and the 
sidewalk we walk on (a solid)—are not chemically pure. We 
can, however, separate these forms of matter into pure sub-
stances. A pure substance (usually referred to simply as a 
substance) is matter that has distinct properties and a compo-
sition that does not vary from sample to sample. Water and 
table salt (sodium chloride) are examples of pure substances.
All substances are either elements or compounds.

level, each element is composed of only one kind of 
atom [Figure 1.5(a and b)].

Compounds are substances composed of two or 
more elements; they contain two or more kinds of at-
oms [Figur
