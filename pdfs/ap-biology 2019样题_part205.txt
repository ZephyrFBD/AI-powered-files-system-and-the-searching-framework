grams show 
evolutionary relationships among lineages—
a.	Phylogenetic trees and cladograms both 
show relationships between lineages, but 
phylogenetic trees show the amount of 
change over time calibrated by fossils or a 
molecular clock.
b.	Traits that are either gained or lost during 
evolution can be used to construct 
phylogenetic trees and cladograms—
  i. Shared characters are present in more 
than one lineage.
 ii. Shared, derived characters indicate 
common ancestry and are informative for 
the construction of phylogenetic trees 
and cladograms.
iii. The out-group represents the lineage that 
is least closely related to the remainder of 
the organisms in the phylogenetic tree or 
cladogram.
c. Molecular data typically provide more 
accurate and reliable evidence than 
morphological traits in the construction of 
phylogenetic trees or cladograms.
