 in water an exothermic or endo-
thermic process? What about dissolving MgSO4 in 
water? (d) For both AgNO3 and MgSO4, use the data to 
calculate the entropy change when the solid is dissolved 
in water. (e) Discuss the results from part (d) with refer-
ence to material presented in this chapter and in the “A 
Closer Look” box on page 814.

Consider the following equilibrium:
N2O41g2 ∆2 NO21g2
Thermodynamic data on these gases are given in Appen-
dix C. You may assume that ∆H° and ∆S° do not vary 
with temperature. (a) At what temperature will an equi-
librium mixture contain equal amounts of the two gases? 
(b) At what temperature will an equilibrium mixture of 
1 atm total pressure contain twice as much NO2 as N2O4? 
(c) At what temperature will an equilibrium mixture of 
 
10 atm total pressure contain twice as much NO2 as N2O4?

The reaction
SO21g2 + 2 H2S1g2 ∆3 S1s2 + 2 H2O1g2
is the basis of a suggested method for removal of SO2 from 
power-plant stack gas
