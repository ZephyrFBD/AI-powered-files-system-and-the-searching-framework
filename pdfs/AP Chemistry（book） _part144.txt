rk and heat, two forms of 
energy. (a) Work is energy used to cause an 
object to move against an opposing force. 
(b) Heat is energy used to increase the 
temperature of an object.
*In using this equation, only the component of the force that is acting parallel to the dis-
tance traveled is used. That will generally be the case for problems we will encounter in this 
chapter.
Give It Some Thought
Which change will lead to a larger change in the kinetic energy of an object, 
doubling its mass or doubling its speed?
**Strictly speaking, velocity is a vector quantity that has a direction; that is, it tells you how fast 
an object is moving and in what direction. Speed is a scalar quantity that tells you how fast an 
object is moving but not the direction of the motion. Unless otherwise stated, we will not 
be concerned with the direction of motion, and thus velocity and speed are interchange-
able quantities for the treatment in this book.
