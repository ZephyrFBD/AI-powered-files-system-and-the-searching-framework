Figure 5. Ideal Gel 
2. Using the ideal gel shown in Figure 5, measure the distance (in cm) that each 
fragment migrated from the origin (the well). (Hint: For consistency, measure from 
the front end of each well to the front edge of each band, i.e., the edge farthest from 
the well.). Enter the measured distances into Table 1. (See * and ** notes below the 
table for an explanation for why there are only six bands seen but more fragments.)
