r color (phenotype).
2. Trait—a variant of a characteristic. Example: red or blond hair color.
3. Allele—alternative form of a gene, such as tall (T ) plants are dominant to short plants (t ).
4. Dominant allele—the allele that is fully expressed.
5. Recessive allele—the allele that is not expressed.
6. Genotype—the genetic makeup of an organism.
7. Phenotype—an organism’s appearance.
B. Law of Segregation—is observed with monohybrid crosses or crosses for a single characteristic. The law
states that each trait must result from two distinct factors and that these factors separate from each other
during reproduction and are incorporated into separate gametes.
C. Law of Independent Assortment—is observed with dihybrid crosses or crossed between two different
characters. The law states that alleles assort independently from each other; therefore, dominant alleles
can combine with recessive alleles.
D. Genetic Crosses
1. Monohybrid cross—a cross that tracks the inheritance pattern of a sin
