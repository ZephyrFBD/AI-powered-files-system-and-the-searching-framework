EXAMPLE 5;14
Accurate measurements on the orbits of the planets indicated that they did
not precisely follow Kepler’s laws. For example, slight deviations from perfectly
elliptical orbits were observed. Newton was aware that this was to be expected
because any planet would be attracted gravitationally not only by the Sun but also
(to a much lesser extent) by the other planets. Such deviations, or perturbations,
in the orbit of Saturn were a hint that helped Newton formulate the law of 
universal gravitation, that all objects attract each other gravitationally. Observa-
