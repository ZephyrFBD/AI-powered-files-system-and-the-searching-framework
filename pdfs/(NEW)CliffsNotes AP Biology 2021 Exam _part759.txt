provides a comparison of the submitted and matching sequences, nucleotide by nucleotide.
9. Expect Value (E Value). The E value provides a numeric value for alignments that are expected by chance. If an
alignment occurs by chance, then it is unlikely to indicate a biological relationship. The smaller the E value, the
more likely the alignment is the result of common ancestry. Small E values use a notation where e represents the
logarithmic base of 10. Thus, the expression “3e–08” represents 3 ×
10−8.
