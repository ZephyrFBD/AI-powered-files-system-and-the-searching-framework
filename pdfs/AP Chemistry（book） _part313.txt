gas closest to them in the periodic table. We might deduce that atoms tend to acquire the 
electron arrangements of the noble gases because these electron arrangements are very 
stable. Nearby elements can obtain these same stable arrangements by losing or gaining 
electrons. For example, the loss of one electron from an atom of sodium leaves it with 
the same number of electrons as in a neon atom (10). Similarly, when chlorine gains an 
electron, it ends up with 18, the same number of electrons as in argon. This simple obser-
vation will be helpful for now to account for the formation of ions. A deeper explanation 
awaits us in Chapter 8, where we discuss chemical bonding.
 
Sample Exercise 2.8 
Predicting Ionic Charge
Predict the charge expected for the most stable ion of barium and the most stable ion of oxygen.

Although it is helpful to know that many ions have the electron 
arrangement of a noble gas, many elements, especially among the 
metals, for
