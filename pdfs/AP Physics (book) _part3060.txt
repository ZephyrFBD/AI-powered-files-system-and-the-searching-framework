That is, energy must be added to bring its energy up, from a negative
value to at least zero in order to free it.
The minimum energy required to remove an electron from an atom initially
in the ground state is called the binding energy or ionization energy. The ionization
energy for hydrogen has been measured to be 13.6 eV, and this corresponds
precisely to removing an electron from the lowest state,
up to
where it can be free.
