ovid-19’ or
‘suspected Covid-19’. That is quite a thought when these are possible
‘side-eﬀects’ from the ‘vaccine’ (they are not ‘side’, they are eﬀects)
listed by the US Food and Drug Administration:
Guillain-Barre syndrome; acute disseminated encephalomyelitis;
transverse myelitis; encephalitis; myelitis; encephalomyelitis;
meningoencephalitis; meningitis; encephalopathy; convulsions;
seizures; stroke; narcolepsy; cataplexy; anaphylaxis; acute
myocardial infarction (heart aĴack); myocarditis; pericarditis;
autoimmune disease; death; implications for pregnancy, and birth
outcomes; other acute demyelinating diseases; non anaphylactic
allergy reactions; thrombocytopenia ; disseminated intravascular
coagulation; venous thromboembolism; arthritis; arthralgia; joint
pain; Kawasaki disease; multisystem inﬂammatory syndrome in
children; vaccine enhanced disease. The laĴer is the way the
‘vaccine’ has the potential to make diseases far worse than they
would otherwise be.
