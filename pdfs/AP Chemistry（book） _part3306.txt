rode gains 
mass, and which loses mass as the cell reaction proceeds? 
 
(c) Write the equation for the overall cell reaction. (d) What 
is the emf generated by the cell under standard conditions?
 20.42  A voltaic cell consists of a strip of cadmium metal in a 
solution of Cd1NO322 in one beaker, and in the other bea-
ker a platinum electrode is immersed in a NaCl solution, 
with Cl2 gas bubbled around the electrode. A salt bridge 
connects the two beakers. (a) Which electrode serves as 
the anode, and which as the cathode? (b) Does the Cd 
electrode gain or lose mass as the cell reaction proceeds? 
 
(c) Write the equation for the overall cell reaction. (d) What 
is the emf generated by the cell under standard conditions?
