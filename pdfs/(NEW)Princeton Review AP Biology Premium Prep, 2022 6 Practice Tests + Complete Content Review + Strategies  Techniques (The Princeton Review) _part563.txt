stages: G1, S, G2, and M. The duration of the cell cycle varies from one species to another and
from one cell type to another. The G1 phase varies the most. For example, embryonic cells can
pass through the G1 phase so quickly that it hardly exists, whereas neurons are arrested in the cell
cycle and do not divide.
49. During which phase do chromosomes replicate?
(A) G1
(B) S
(C) G2
(D) M
50. In mammalian cells, the first sign of mitosis beginning is the
(A) appearance of chromosomes
(B) separation of chromatids
(C) disappearance of the cell membrane
(D) replication of chromosomes
51. If the cell cycle fails to progress, which of the following is NOT a possible explanation?
(A) There are inadequate phosphate groups available for the cyclin dependent kinase.
(B) A tumor suppressor protein has signaled for apoptosis.
(C) A cyclin is unable to release from its cyclin dependent kinase.
(D) An inhibitor of a cyclin gene has been highly expressed.
52. Since neurons are destined never to divid
