rotein molecules dispersed in water.) Furthermore, because they scatter 
light, a light beam can be seen as it passes through a colloidal dispersion (Figure 13.25). 
This scattering of light by colloidal particles, known as the Tyndall effect, makes it pos-
sible to see the light beam of an automobile on a dusty dirt road, or the sunlight streaming 
through trees or clouds. Not all wavelengths are scattered to the same extent. Colors at 
the blue end of the visible spectrum are scattered more than those at the red end by the 
molecules and small dust particles in the atmosphere. As a result, our sky appears blue. At 
sunset, light from the sun travels through more of the atmosphere; blue light is scattered 
even more, allowing the reds and yellows to pass through and be seen.
Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Colloids
The most important colloids are those in which the dispersing medium is water. These 
colloids may be hydrophilic (“water loving”) or hydrophobic (“water fearing”).
