form 
a series of bright and dark bands, known as a diffraction pattern. The 
bright bands correspond to constructive overlapping of the light 
waves, and the dark bands correspond to destructive overlapping of 
the light waves. 
 (Section 9.8, “Phases in Atomic and Molecular 
Orbitals”) The most effective diffraction of light occurs when the wave-
length of the light and the width of the slits are similar in magnitude.
The spacing of the layers of atoms in solid crystals is usually 
about 2–20 Å. The wavelengths of X rays are also in this range. Thus, 
a crystal can serve as an effective diffraction grating for X rays. X-ray 
diffraction results from the scattering of X rays by a regular arrange-
ment of atoms, molecules, or ions. Much of what we know about crys-
tal structures has been obtained by looking at the diffraction patterns 
that result when X rays pass through a crystal, a technique known as 
X-ray crystallography. As shown in Figure 12.9 a monochromatic beam 
of X rays is
