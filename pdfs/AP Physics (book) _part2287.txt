hich is placed a distance 
from the rod’s
left-hand end and is immersed in a uniform magnetic field
of magnitude B directed into the page (Fig. 20–69). An
object whose mass M is 6.0 times greater than the rod’s mass
is hung from the rod’s left-hand end. What current (direction
and magnitude) should flow through the rod in order for 
it to be “balanced” (i.e., be at rest horizontally) on the 
fulcrum?
(Flexible
connecting wires which
exert negligible force
on the rod are not
shown.)

Problem 83.
86. A bolt of lightning strikes a metal flag pole, one end of
which is anchored in the ground. Estimate the force the
Earth’s magnetic field can exert on the flag pole while the
lightning-induced current flows. See Example 18–10.
87. A sort of “projectile launcher” is shown in Fig. 20–71.
A large current moves in a closed loop composed of fixed
rails, a power supply, and a very light, almost frictionless
bar (pale
