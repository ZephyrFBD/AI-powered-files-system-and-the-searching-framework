lectronegativity is defined as the ability of an atom in a molecule  
to attract electrons to itself.
The greater an atom’s electronegativity, the greater its ability to attract electrons to 
itself. The electronegativity of an atom in a molecule is related to the atom’s ionization 
energy and electron affinity, which are properties of isolated atoms. An atom with a very 
negative electron affinity and a high ionization energy both attracts electrons from other 
atoms and resists having its electrons attracted away; therefore, it is highly electronegative.
Electronegativity values can be based on a variety of properties, not just ionization energy 
and electron affinity. The American chemist Linus Pauling (1901–1994) developed the first and 
most widely used electronegativity scale, which is based on thermochemical data. As Figure 8.8 
shows, there is generally an increase in electronegativity from left to right across a period—that 
is, from the most metallic to the most nonmetallic e
