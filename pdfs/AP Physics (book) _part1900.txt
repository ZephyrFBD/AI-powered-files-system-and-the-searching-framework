l that arrives at the display activates only one horizontal wire at
a time (the orange one in Fig. 17–33): that one horizontal wire has a voltage (let’s
say 
) whereas all the others are at 
. That 
is not applied directly to
the pixels, but allows the vertical wires to apply briefly the proper “signal voltage”to
each subpixel along that row (via a transistor, see below). These signal voltages,
known as the data stream, are applied to all the vertical wires just as that one row is
activated: they provide the correct brightness for each subpixel in that activated row.
A few subpixels are highlighted in Fig. 17–33. Immediately afterward, the other
rows are activated, one by one, until the entire frame has been completed (in 
).
