the water drags at the bottom and is slowed down, while the
crests move ahead at higher speed (Fig. 11–30) and “spill” over the top.)
Surface waves are also set up on the Earth when an earthquake occurs. The
waves that travel along the surface are mainly responsible for the damage caused
by earthquakes.

Earthquake waves
Waves which travel along a line in one dimension, such as transverse waves
on a stretched string, or longitudinal waves in a rod or fluid-filled tube, are linear
or one-dimensional waves. Surface waves, such as water waves (Fig. 11–21), are
two-dimensional waves. Finally, waves t
