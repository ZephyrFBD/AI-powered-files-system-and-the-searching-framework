stigate whether the proteolytic
enzymes are evolutionarily conserved among
species?
(A) Are the genes encoding the proteolytic
enzymes expressed in the same cell types  
in all species? 
(B) Once the precursor proteins of different 
species are cleaved, do the active signaling 
proteins bind to the same receptors on 
different target cells? 
(C) If a proteolytic enzyme from one species is 
incubated with a precursor protein from 
another species, does correct cleavage 
occur? 
(D) Are the proteolytic enzymes synthesized in 
the rough endoplasmic reticulum of all 
species? 
41. Transmission of an action potential across a
synapse involves the release of neurotransmitters
by the presynaptic neuron. The arrival of the
action potential triggers a rise in the calcium
concentration in the synaptic terminal, and the
change in concentration triggers a release of
neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Which of
the following representations of the movement of
calcium, sodium, and potassium i
