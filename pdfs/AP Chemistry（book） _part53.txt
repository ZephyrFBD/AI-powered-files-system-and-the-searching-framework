students. The chapter 
provides an opportunity to show how abstract chemical bonding 
concepts impact real-world applications. The modular organiza-
tion of the chapter allows you to tailor your coverage to focus on 
the materials (semiconductors, polymers, nanomaterials, and 
so forth) that are most relevant to your students and your own 
interests. This section of the book concludes with Chapter 13 
which covers the formation and properties of solutions.
The next several chapters examine the factors that deter-
mine the speed and extent of chemical reactions: kinetics 
(Chapter 14), equilibria (Chapters 15–17), thermodynamics 
(Chapter 19), and electrochemistry (Chapter 20). Also in this 
section is a chapter on environmental chemistry (Chapter 18), in 
which the concepts developed in preceding chapters are applied 
to a discussion of the atmosphere and hydrosphere. This chapter 
has increasingly come to be focused on green chemistry and the 
impacts of human activities on Earth’s wa
