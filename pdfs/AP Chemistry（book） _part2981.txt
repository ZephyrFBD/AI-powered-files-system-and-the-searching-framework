.45 * 103 M-1 cm-1 at 280 nm, its absorption maximum 
(A Closer Look, p. 576). Below 50 ppb, the impurity is not 
a problem for human health. Given that most spectrome-
ters cannot detect absorbances less than 0.0001 with good 
reliability, is measuring the absorbance of a water sample at 
280 nm a good way to detect concentrations of the impu-
rity above the 50-ppb threshold?
 18.82  The concentration of H2O in the stratosphere is about 5 
ppm. It undergoes photodissociation according to:
H2O1g2 ยก H1g2 + OH1g2
(a) Write out the Lewis-dot structures for both products and 
reactant.
(b) Using Table 8.3, calculate the wavelength required to 
cause this dissociation.
(c) The hydroxyl radical, OH, can react with ozone, giving 
the following reactions:
OH 
1g2 + O31g2 ยก HO21g2 + O21g2
HO21g2 + O1g2 ยก OH1g2 + O21g2
What overall reaction results from these two elementary reac-
tions? What is the catalyst in the overall reaction? Explain.
