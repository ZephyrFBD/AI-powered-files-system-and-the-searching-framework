Action Potential
An action potential, or impulse, can be generated only in the axon of a
neuron. When an axon is stimulated sufficiently to overcome the threshold,
the permeability of a region of the membrane suddenly changes and the
impulse can pass. Sodium channels open and sodium ions flood into the
cell, down the concentration gradient. In response, potassium channels
open and potassium ions flood out of the cell. This rapid movement of
ions or wave of depolarization reverses the polarity of the membrane and
is called an action potential. The action potential is localized and lasts a
very short time. The sodium-potassium pump restores the membrane to
its original polarized condition by pumping sodium and potassium ions
back to their original position. This period of repolarization, which lasts a
few milliseconds, is called the refractory period, during which the neuron
cannot respond to another stimulus. The refractory period ensures that an
impulse moves a
