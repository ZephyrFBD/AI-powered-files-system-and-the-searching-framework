 Which of the following statements best explains these data?
 
 (a) The larger the dipole moment, the stronger the intermo-
lecular forces, and therefore the boiling point is lowest for the 
molecule with the largest dipole moment. (b) The dispersion 
forces increase from F to Cl to Br; since the boiling point also 
increases in this order, the dispersion forces must make a far 
greater contribution to intermolecular interactions than 
 
dipole–dipole interactions. (c) The trend in electronegativity 
is F 7 Cl 7 Br; therefore, the most ionic compound 1CH2F22 
has the lowest boiling point, and the most covalent compound 
1CH2Br22 has the highest boiling point. (d) Boiling point in-
creases with molecular weight for these nonpolar compounds.
