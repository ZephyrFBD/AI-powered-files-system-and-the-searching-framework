1–9 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) 
and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a phenomenon which soon after its discovery
in 1946 became a powerful research tool in a variety of fields from physics to
chemistry and biochemistry. It is also an important medical imaging technique.
We first briefly discuss the phenomenon, and then look at its applications.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
We saw in Chapter 28 (Section 28–6) that when atoms are placed in a magnetic
field, atomic energy levels split into several closely spaced levels (see Fig. 28–8).
Nuclei, too, exhibit these magnetic properties. We examine only the simplest, the
hydrogen (H) nucleus, since it is the one most used, even for medical imaging.
