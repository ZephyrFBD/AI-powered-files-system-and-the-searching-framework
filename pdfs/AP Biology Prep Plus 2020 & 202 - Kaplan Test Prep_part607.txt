ond
vector containing the enhancer region of protein X. They
stimulated the cells with an inducer known to stimulate
expression of protein X. Which of the following experimental
results will most likely be observed?
The cells will not transcribe the mRNA because the site where
RNA polymerase II attaches is missing.
(A)
No transcription will be observed because cells in tissue
culture do not express foreign DNA.
(B)
The cells will transcribe the mRNA for protein X, but the
mRNA will be unstable and rapidly degraded.
(C)
No or little transcription will occur because enhancer
sequences must be cis to (on the same chromosome as) the
open reading frame.
(D)
