e fraction is as a
whole. For example, is less than 
Thus, if the speed is doubled, the time is halved,
which is what we want to express by this inverse proportionality relationship.
If you suspect that a relationship exists between two or more quantities, you
can try to determine the precise nature of this relationship by varying one of the
quantities and measuring how the other varies as a result. Sometimes a given
quantity is affected by two or more quantities; for instance, the acceleration of an
object is related to both its mass and the applied force. In such a case, only one
quantity is varied at a time, while the others are held constant.
When one quantity affects another, we often use the expression is a function of
to indicate this dependence; for example, we say that the pressure in a tire is a
function of the temperature.
Whatever kind of proportion is found to hold, it can be changed to an equality
by finding the proper proportionality constant. Quantitative statements or
