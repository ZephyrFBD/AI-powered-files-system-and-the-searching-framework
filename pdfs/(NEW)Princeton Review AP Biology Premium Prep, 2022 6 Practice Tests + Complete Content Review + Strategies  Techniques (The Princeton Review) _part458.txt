the intestine, preparing a niche for pathogenic bacteria to grow.
(C) Bacteria populations grow exponentially until the carrying capacity is reached.
(D) Pathogenic bacteria do not recognize the intestinal cells because they are coated with probiotic bacteria.
Summary
Behavior
Behavior is an organismâ€™s response to the environment. Behavior can be instinctual (inborn), learned, or social:
Types of social behaviors include agonistic behavior, dominance hierarchies, territoriality, and altruistic
behavior.
There are also plant-specific behaviors known as tropisms. The three basic tropisms are phototropism,
gravitropism, and thigmotropism.
Ecology
There are several major biomes (tundra, taiga, temperate deciduous forest, grasslands, deserts, tropical
rainforests) that make up the biosphere. Each biosphere contains ecosystems.
Within an ecosystem are communities, which consist of organisms fulfilling one of three main roles:
Producers, or autotrophs, convert light energy to chemical energy
