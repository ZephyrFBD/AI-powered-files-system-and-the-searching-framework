 tangent is a straight line that touches the curve only at the one chosen point, without passing
across or through the curve at that point.

FIGURE 2;28 Same position vs. time curve 
as in Fig. 2–27. Note that the average 
velocity over the time interval 
(which is the slope of 
) is less than the 
average velocity over the time interval 
The slope of the line tangent 
to the curve at point 
equals the 
instantaneous velocity at time t1 .
