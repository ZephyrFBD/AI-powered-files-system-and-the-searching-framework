ing light with longer wavelengths may not provide sufficient energy for the 
organism. 
Appropriate reasoning to support the proposal: 
• 
Natural selection favored organisms that rely on pigments that absorb available 
wavelengths of light. 
• 
Endosymbiosis: chloroplasts evolved from cyanobacteria with pigments that used only 
certain wavelengths. 
• 
Genetic drift eliminated pigments that absorbed certain wavelengths of light. 
• 
Mutation(s) altered the pigment(s) used by organism.

Question 3 
 
  Fossils of lobe-finned fishes, which are ancestors of amphibians, are found in rocks that are at least 380 
million years old. Fossils of the oldest amphibian-like vertebrate animals with true legs and lungs are 
found in rocks that are approximately 363 million years old. 
  Three samples of rocks are available that might contain fossils of a transit
