 string? (b) If the two strings
have the same length and are under the same tension, what
must be the ratio of their masses 
(c) If the strings,
instead, have the same mass per unit length and are under
the same tension, what is the ratio of their lengths 
(d) If their masses and lengths are the same, what must be
the ratio of the tensions in the two strings?
82. A string can have a “free” end if that end is attached to a
ring that can slide without friction on a vertical pole
(Fig. 11–60). Determine the wavelengths of the resonant
vibrations of such a string with one end fixed and the other
free.

Problem 82.
76. A mass m is gently placed on the end of a freely hanging
spring. The mass then falls 27.0 cm before it stops and
begins to rise. What is the frequency of the oscillation?
83. The ripples in a certain groove 10.2 cm from the center of a
33 -rpm phonograph record have a wavelength of 1.55 mm.
What will be the frequency of the sound emitted?
