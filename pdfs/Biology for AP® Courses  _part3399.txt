maturation of the ova. In females, the pituitary also produces prolactin, which stimulates milk production after childbirth,
and oxytocin, which stimulates uterine contraction during childbirth and milk let-down during suckling.
Insulin is produced by the pancreas in response to rising blood glucose levels and allows cells to utilize blood glucose and
store excess glucose for later use. Diabetes mellitus is caused by reduced insulin activity and causes high blood glucose
levels, or hyperglycemia. Glucagon is released by the pancreas in response to low blood glucose levels and stimulates the
breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which can be used by the body. The bodyâ€™s basal metabolic rate is controlled by the
thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). The anterior pituitary produces thyroid stimulating hormone
(TSH), wh
