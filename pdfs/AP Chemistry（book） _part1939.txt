Semiconductors on the Nanoscale
Figure 12.22 shows that, in small molecules, electrons occupy discrete molecular 
orbitals, whereas in macroscale solids the electrons occupy delocalized bands. At what 
point does a molecule get so large that it starts behaving as though it has delocalized 
bands rather than localized molecular orbitals? For semiconductors, both theory 
and experiment tell us that the answer is roughly at 1 to 10 nm (about 10â€“100 atoms 
across). The exact number depends on the specific semiconductor material. The equa-
tions of quantum mechanics that were used for electrons in atoms can be applied to 
electrons (and holes) in semiconductors to estimate the size where materials undergo 
a crossover from molecular orbitals to bands. Because these effects become import-
ant at 1 to 10 nm, semiconductor particles with diameters in this size range are called 
quantum dots.
One of the most spectacular effects of reducing the size of a semiconductor crystal is 
that t
