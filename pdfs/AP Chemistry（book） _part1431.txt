del leads 
us to predict that all the carbon–carbon bond lengths will be identical, with a bond 
length between that of a C ¬C single bond (1.54 Å) and that of a C “C double bond 
(1.34 Å). This prediction is consistent with the observed carbon–carbon bond length in 
benzene (1.40 Å).
Because we cannot describe the p bonds in benzene as individual bonds between 
neighboring atoms, we say that benzene has a six-electron p system delocalized among 
the six carbon atoms. Delocalization of the electrons in its p bonds gives benzene a spe-
cial stability. Electron delocalization in p bonds is also responsible for the color of many 
organic molecules. A final important point to remember about delocalized p bonds is the 
constraint they place on the geometry of a molecule. For optimal overlap of the p orbit-
als, all the atoms involved in a delocalized p bonding network should lie in the same 
plane. This restriction imparts a certain rigidity to the molecule that is absent in mole-
cules con
