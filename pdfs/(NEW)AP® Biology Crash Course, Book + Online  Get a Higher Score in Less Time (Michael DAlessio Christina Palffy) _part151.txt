 growth of a population because of no limitation on
resources; the result is a J-shaped curve.
2. Logistical Model—more applicable to most populations in that it takes into account limited growth of
a population due to limited resources; the result is an S-curve. The carrying capacity is the maximum
population size a habitat can hold (defined by the letter K).
Be prepared to interpret population growth graphs and survivorship curves on the AP® Biology exam.
3. There are two types of factors that limit the growth of populations.
i.
Density-independent factors—affect population size regardless of density; most likely factors
include weather or natural disasters.
ii. Density-dependent factors—affect the population size based on the density of the population; most
likely factors include food, predation, migration, or disease.
Limited resources reduce population size in a density-dependent manner because competition
for limited resources becomes more intense as the number of individuals usi
