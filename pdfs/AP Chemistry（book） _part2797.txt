C and 0.950 atm is bubbled through 0.500 L of 0.150 M NH3 solution. Calculate the pH 
of the resulting solution assuming that all the HCl dissolves and that the volume of the solution remains 0.500 L.
The number of moles of NH3 in the solution is 
given by the product of the volume of the solu-
tion and its concentration:
The number of moles of HCl gas is calculated 
from the ideal-gas law:
Moles NH3 = 10.500 L210.150 mol NH3>L2 = 0.0750 mol NH3

reactions used must proceed so far toward completion that any concentration of cations 
remaining in the solution is too small to interfere with subsequent tests.
Letâ€™s look at each of these five groups of cations, briefly examining the logic used in 
this qualitative analysis scheme.
Group 1. Insoluble chlorides: Of the common metal ions, only Ag+1aq2, Hg2
2+1aq2, 
and Pb2 +1aq2 form insoluble c
