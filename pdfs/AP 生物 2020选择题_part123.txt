1.A: Describe biological concepts 
and/or processes.
ENE-2.C: Explain how 
the structure of biological 
membranes influences 
selective permeability.
Membrane 
Permeability
(A) 
Correct. Carbon dioxide is a small molecule without a charge and so 
can pass through a cell membrane by simple diffusion.
(B) 
Incorrect. Carbon dioxide is a small molecule without a charge and so 
can pass through a cell membrane by simple diffusion and does not 
require facilitated diffusion through membrane proteins.
(C) 
Incorrect. Carbon dioxide is a small molecule without a charge and so 
can pass through a cell membrane by simple diffusion and does not 
require active transport through membrane proteins.
(D) 
Incorrect. Carbon dioxide is a small molecule without a charge and so 
can pass through a cell membrane by simple diffusion and does require 
active transport th
