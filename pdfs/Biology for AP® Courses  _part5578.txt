a single mRNA investigational medicine.

the road to making living, breathing people into cyborgs? What is
missed with the ‘vaccines’ is the digital connection between synthetic
material and the body that I highlighted earlier with the study that
hacked a computer with human DNA. On one level the body is
digital, based on mathematical codes, and I’ll have more about that
in the next chapter. Those who ridiculously claim that mRNA
‘vaccines’ are not designed to change human genetics should explain
the words of Dr Tal Zaks, chief medical oﬃcer at Moderna, in a 2017
TED talk. He said that over the last 30 years ‘we’ve been living this

you, that we are actually hacking the softwar
