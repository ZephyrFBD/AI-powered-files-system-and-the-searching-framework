ontinuous development because certain viruses, such as influenza, have a high mutation rate
compared to other viruses and normal host cells. With influenza, mutations in the surface molecules of the virus help the
organism evade the protective immunity that may have been obtained in a previous influenza season, making it necessary
for individuals to get vaccinated every year. Other viruses, such as those that cause the childhood diseases measles, mumps,
and rubella, mutate so infrequently that the same vaccine is used year after year.
