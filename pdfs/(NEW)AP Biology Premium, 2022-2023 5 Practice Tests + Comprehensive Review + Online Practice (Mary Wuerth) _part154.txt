ets, parsnips, and potatoes).
Five cubes of equal sizes and surface areas are cut from each of the vegetables, and their masses are recorded.
Each cube is placed in a beaker that contains a 0.35 molar sucrose solution for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the
cubes were removed from the solutions and weighed, and the percent change in mass for each cube was
calculated. The mean percent change in mass for each vegetable and the standard errors of the mean are shown
in the table.

(a) Explain why some of the vegetables would have a positive percent change in mass while others would
have a negative percent change in mass during the course of the experiment.
(b) Construct an appropriately labeled graph that shows the mean percent change in mass for each vegetable.
Include 95% confidence intervals.
(c) Analyze the data to determine which vegetable has a water
