rs the bloodstream.
During exhalation, the lungs expel air and lung volume decreases. In the next few sections, the process of human breathing
will be explained.
The Mechanics of Human Breathing
Boyle’s Law is the gas law that states that in a closed space, pressure and volume are inversely related. As volume decreases,
pressure increases and vice versa (Figure 30.15). The relationship between gas pressure and volume helps to explain the
mechanics of breathing.
Figure 30.15 This graph shows data from Boyle’s original 1662 experiment, which shows that pressure and volume
are inversely related. No units are given as Boyle used arbitrary units in his experiments.
There is always a slightly negative pressure within the thoracic cavity, which aids in keeping the airways of the lungs
open. During inhalation, volume increases as a result of contraction of the diaphragm, and pressure decreases (according
to Boyle’s Law). This decrease of pressure in the thoracic cavity relative to the environm
