symmetrically across the 
molecule.
▲ Figure 8.14 Resonance. Describing a  
molecule as a blend of different resonance  
structures is similar to describing a paint color  
as a blend of primary colors. (a) Green paint is  
a blend of blue and yellow. We cannot describe  
green as a single primary color. (b) The ozone  
molecule is a blend of two resonance  
structures. We cannot describe the ozone  
molecule in terms of a single Lewis structure.
Give It Some Thought
The O—O bonds in ozone can be described as “one and a half bonds.” Does this 
suggest that the bond lengths in ozone are longer or shorter than those in the O2 
molecule?
