 trees from distances (measures of similarity or 
difference of sequences) or characters (deletions, or structural features like alpha 
helices)? It is important for students to develop their own metrics for determining the 
distances between two or more sequences. Doing this allows students to see how the 
sensitivity of our inference of similarity or dissimilarity is dependent upon the metric 
used. 
 
Every phylogenetic tree is a hypothesis. How do we interpret the tree? How many 
trees could be constructed from the same data with a similar degree of fit? How do we 
visualize a tree? Science education researchers have examined how students interpret 
phylogenetic trees. The mathematical distinction between geometry and topology 
are particularly useful here. A tree is like a baby’s mobile, with various baby animals 
dangling above the crib. We can swivel the mobile in the air, or lay the tree down flat
