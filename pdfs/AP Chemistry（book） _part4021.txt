¡  2 KCl(s)
(b) SrO(s) + H2O(l) ¡  Sr(OH)2(aq)
(c) 4 Li(s) + O2(g) ¡  2 Li2O(s) (d) 2 Na(s) + S(l) ¡  Na2S(s)
7.71 (a) The reactions of the alkali metals with hydrogen and with 
a halogen are redox reactions. Both hydrogen and the halogen gain 
electrons and are reduced. (The alkali metal loses electrons and is oxi-
dized.) Ca(s) + F2(g) ¡  CaF2(s); Ca(s) + H2(g) ¡  CaH2(s).
(b) The oxidation number of Ca in both products is +2. The electron 
conﬁguration is that of Ar, 3Ne43s23p6. 7.73 (a) Br, 3Ar44s24p5; Cl, 
3Ne43s23p5 (b) Br and Cl are in the same group, and both adopt a 1- 
ionic charge. (c) The ionization energy of Br is smaller than that of Cl, 
because the 4p valence electrons in Br are farther from to the nucleus 
and less tightly held than the 3p electrons of Cl. (d) Both react slowly 
with water to form HX + HOX. (e) The electron affinity of Br is less
