orax and legs. This population
now appears to be split into 2 sub-groups, purple and
orange-legged. Researchers hypothesize that the purple-
legged group may be increasingly resistant to the Bt
(Bacillus thuringiensis) toxin. Which idea supports this
observation?
a.
transgenesis
b.
natural selection
c.
hybridization
d.
recombination
47. Describe the process of molecular cloning.
a.
The foreign DNA and plasmid are cut with the
same restriction enzyme and DNA is inserted
within the lacZ gene, whose product metabolizes
lactose. The foreign DNA and vector are
allowed to anneal. The vector is transferred to a
bacterial host that is ampicillin sensitive and
those with a disrupted lacZ gene show inability
to metabolize X-gal.
b.
The foreign DNA and plasmid are denatured
using high heat, and DNA is inserted within the
lacZ gene, whose product metabolizes glucose.
The foreign DNA and vector are allowed to
anneal. The vector is transferred to a bacterial
host that is ampicillin sensitive and dis
