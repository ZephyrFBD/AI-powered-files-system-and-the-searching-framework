 success. In their 
writing, students should be clear that while 
natural selection acts on individuals, it is 
populations that evolve. Another common 
error on the exam is that students do not 
clearly differentiate the types of reproductive 
isolating mechanisms that lead to speciation.
Developing Understanding
The concepts in Unit 7 build on foundational content from previous units as students discover 
natural selection, a mechanism of evolutionâ€”the theory that populations that are better 
adapted to their environment will survive and reproduce. Thus, the evolution of a species 
involves a change in its genetic makeup over time. In this unit, students study the evidence for 
and mechanisms of evolutionary change. Students also learn what happens when a species 
does not adapt to a changing or volatile environment and about the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
as a model for describing and predicting allele frequencies in nonevolving populations. Students 
will learn to calculate and dr
