▶Practice Exercise 2
Molten gold poured into a mold solidifies at atmospheric pres-
sure. With the gold defined as the system, is the solidification an 
exothermic or endothermic process?
SOLUTION
Analyze Our goal is to determine whether ∆H is positive or nega-
tive for each process. Because each process occurs at constant pres-
sure, the enthalpy change equals the quantity of heat  
absorbed or 
released, ∆H = qP. 
Plan We must predict whether heat is absorbed or released by the 
system in each process. Processes in which heat is absorbed are en-
dothermic and have a positive sign for ∆H; those in which heat is 
released are exothermic and have a negative sign for ∆H.
Solve In (a) the water that makes up the ice cube is the system. 
The ice cube absorbs heat from the surroundings as it melts, so 
∆H is positive and the process is endothermic. In (b) the system
