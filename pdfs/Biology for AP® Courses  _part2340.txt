Viruses can also be classified by the design of their capsids (Figure 21.4 and Figure 21.5). Capsids are classified as naked
icosahedral, enveloped icosahedral, enveloped helical, naked helical, and complex (Figure 21.6 and Figure 21.7). The type
of genetic material (DNA or RNA) and its structure (single- or double-stranded, linear or circular, and segmented or non-
segmented) are used to classify the virus core structures (Table 21.2).
Figure 21.6 Adenovirus (left) is depicted with a double-stranded DNA genome enclosed in an icosahedral capsid that
is 90–100 nm across. The virus, shown clustered in the micrograph (right), is transmitted orally and causes a variety of
illnesses in vertebrate
