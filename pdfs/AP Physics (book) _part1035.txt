le is
the hydraulic lift, illustrated in Fig. 10–6a, in which a small input force is used to
exert a large output force by making the area of the output piston larger than the area
of the input piston. To see how this works, we assume the input and output
pistons are at the same height (at least approximately). Then the external input
force 
by Pascal’s principle, increases the pressure equally throughout.
Therefore, at the same level (see Fig. 10–6a),
where the input quantities are represented by the subscript “in” and the output
by “out.” Since
we write the above equality as
or
The quantity 
is called the mechanical advantage of the hydraulic lift, and
it is equal to the ratio of the areas. For example, if the area of the output piston 
is 20 times that of the input cylinder, the force is multiplied by a factor of 20.
Thus a force of 200 lb could lift a 4000-lb car.
