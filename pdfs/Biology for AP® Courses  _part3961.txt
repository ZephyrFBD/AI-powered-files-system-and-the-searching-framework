ly as dimeric molecules, not pentamers.
IgE is present in the serum in small quantities and is best characterized in its role as an allergy mediator. IgD is also present
in small quantities. Similar to IgM, BCRs of the IgD class are found on the surface of naïve B cells. This class supports
antigen recognition and maturation of B cells to plasma cells.
Antibody Functions
Differentiated plasma cells are crucial players in the humoral response, and the antibodies they secrete are particularly
significant against extracellular pathogens and toxins. Antibodies circulate freely and act independently of plasma cells.
Antibodies can be transferred from one individual to another to temporarily protect against infectious disease. For instance,
a person who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease agent can donate blood to
a nonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity through antibodies in the donor’s blood serum. This phenomenon
is called passive imm
