 different molecules in a cell.
When there is excess tryptophan in a cell, the tryptophan binds to the repressor protein, which then binds to
the operator of the tryptophan operon, preventing the production of more tryptophan. This prevents the cell
from wasting energy and resources on producing more tryptophan than it needs.

(a) If the pea plants are heterozygous for both traits, the cross would be RrPp Ã— RrPp. So  of the offspring
would be expected to have round peas, and  of the offspring would be expected to have wrinkled peas.
Additionally,  of the offspring would be expected to have purple flowers, and  of the offspring would be
expected to have white flowers. So the expected numbers of offspring would be:
(b) Using the chi-square formula:
(c) Since there are four possible phenotypic outcomes in the experiment, there are 3 degrees of freedom. Using
a p-value of 0.05 and 3 degrees of freedom, the critical value from the chi-square table is 7.81. Since the
calculated chi-square
