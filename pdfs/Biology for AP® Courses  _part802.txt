Figure 7.7 The second half of glycolysis involves phosphorylation without ATP investment (step 6) and produces two
NADH and four ATP molecules per glucose.
Here again is a potential limiting factor for this pathway. The continuation of the reaction depends upon the availability of
the oxidized form of the electron carrier, NAD+. Thus, NADH must be continuously oxidized back into NAD+ in order to
keep this step going. If NAD+ is not available, the second half of glycolysis slows down or stops. If oxygen is available in
the system, the NADH will be oxidized readily, though indirectly, and the high-energy electrons from the hydrogen released
in this process will be used to produce ATP. In an environment without oxygen, an alternate pathway (fermentation) can
provide the oxidation of NADH to NAD+.
