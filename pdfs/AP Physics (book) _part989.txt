 The crane’s dimensions are
shown in Fig. 9–48b. (a) Where must the crane’s 9500-kg
counterweight be placed when the load is lifted from the
ground? (The counterweight is usually moved auto-
matically via sensors and motors to precisely compensate
for the load.) (b) Determine the maximum load that can be
lifted with this counterweight when it is placed at its full
extent. Ignore the mass of the beam.

5. (II) Calculate the forces 
and 
that the supports exert
on the diving board of Fig. 9–49 when a 52-kg person
stands at its tip. (a) Ignore the weight of the board.
(b) Take into account the board’s mass of 28 kg. Assume
the board’s CG is at its center.
