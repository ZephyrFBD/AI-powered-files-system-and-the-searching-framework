 23.72  Which complex ions in Exercise 23.71 have optical isomers?
 23.73  The molecule dimethylphosphinoethane 3(CH3)2PCH2CH2
P(CH3)2, which is abbreviated dmpe] is used as a ligand 
for some complexes that serve as catalysts. A complex that 
contains this ligand is Mo(CO)4(dmpe). (a) Draw the Lewis 
structure for dmpe, and compare it with ethylenediamine as 
a coordinating ligand. (b) What is the oxidation state of Mo 
in Na23Mo(CN)2(CO)2(dmpe)]? (c) Sketch the structure of 
the 3Mo(CN)2(CO)2(dmpe)42- ion, including all the possi-
ble isomers.
 23.74  The square-planar complex [Pt(en)Cl2] only forms in one 
of two possible geometric isomers. Which isomer is not 
observed: cis or trans?
 23.75  The acetylacetone ion forms very stable complexes with 
many metallic ions. It acts as a bidentate ligand, coordi-
