MisConceptual Questions
16. Do isotopes that undergo electron capture generally lie
above or below the stable nuclides in Fig. 30â€“2?
17. Can hydrogen or deuterium emit an 
particle? Explain.
18. Why are many artificially produced radioactive isotopes
rare in nature?
19. An isotope has a half-life of one month. After two months,
will a given sample of this isotope have completely decayed?
If not, how much remains?
20. Why are none of the elements with 
stable?
21. A proton strikes a 
nucleus. As a result, an 
particle
and another particle are rel
