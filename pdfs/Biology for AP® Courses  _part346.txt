KEY TERMS
type of secondary structure of proteins formed by folding of the polypeptide into a helix
shape with hydrogen bonds stabilizing the structure
monomer of a protein; has a central carbon or alpha carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, a
hydrogen, and an R group or side chain is attached; the R group is different for the most common 20 amino acids
secondary structure found in proteins in which “pleats” are formed by hydrogen
bonding between atoms on the backbone of the polypeptide chain
large molecule necessary for life that is built from smaller organic molecules
