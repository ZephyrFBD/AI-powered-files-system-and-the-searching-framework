at the removal of predators also
resulted in the die-off of herbivores, what would you
suspect occurred?
a.
Removal of predators would directly lower the
number of herbivores.
b.
The lack of predators could mean that too much
primary production occurred.
c.
Herbivores from another region may have
entered the ecosystem and consumed the
primary producers, causing death of the original
herbivores species.
d.
Overeating by herbivores could have caused
depletion of the primary producers, leaving the
herbivores without enough food.
45. Although producers are essential for energy to flow
into an ecosystem, consumers also have important roles.
What might happen in an aquatic system with excess
consumers relative to producers?
a.
Oxygen depletion would result in dieoff.
b.
There would be an excess of the basal energy
source.
c.
Consumers would deplete the abundance of
producers.
d.
There would be more undigestable animal parts.
46. The following is the equation for trophic level transfer
