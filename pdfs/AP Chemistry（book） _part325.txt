metals that form only one cation (only one possible charge) are those of group 
1A and group 2A, as well as Al3+ (group 3A) and two transition-metal ions: Ag+ 
(group 1B) and Zn2+ (group 2B). Charges are not expressed when naming these 
ions. However, if there is any doubt in your mind whether a metal forms more 
than one cation, use a Roman numeral to indicate the charge. It is never wrong to 
do so, even though it may be unnecessary.
An older method still widely used for distinguishing between differently 
charged ions of a metal uses the endings -ous and -ic added to the root of the ele-
ment’s Latin name:
Fe2+
ferrous ion
Cu+
cuprous ion
Fe3+
ferric ion
Cu2+
cupric ion
Although we will only rarely use these older names in this text, you might 
 
encounter them elsewhere.
