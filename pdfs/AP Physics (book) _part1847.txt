e rate at which the electric
potential decreases over distance in that direction. For example, the x component
of the electric field is given by

Breakdown Voltage
When very high voltages are present, air can become ionized due to the high electric
fields. Any odd free electron can be accelerated to sufficient kinetic energy to
knock electrons out of 
and 
molecules of the air. This breakdown of air occurs
when the electric field exceeds about
When electrons recombine with
their molecules, light is emitted. Such breakdown of air is the source of lightning,
the spark of a car’s spark plug, and even short sparks between your fingers and a
doorknob after you walk across a synthetic rug or slide across a car seat (which can
result in a significant transfer of charge to you).
