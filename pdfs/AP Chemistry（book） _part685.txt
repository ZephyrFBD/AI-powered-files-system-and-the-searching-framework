 that ex-
pand and in the process do work that can be used to power an automobile. Champagne is made 
when yeasts use chemical reactions to ferment sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide. By car-
rying out the last stages of fermentation in a corked bottle, pressure from the generated CO2 
builds up and can be used to do work when the cork is popped [Figure 5.1(b)]. Yet another ex-
ample is a battery, where redox reactions produce electrical energy that can be used to do work.
All forms of energy can be classified as either kinetic or potential energy 
 (Section 1.4). 
 
The energy that originates from chemical reactions is associated mainly with changes in 
potential energy. This energy results from electrostatic interactions at the atomic level. Thus, if 
we are to understand the energy associated with chemical reactions, we must first understand 
electrostatic potential energy, which arises from the interactions between charged particles.
The electrostatic potential energy, Eel, ass
