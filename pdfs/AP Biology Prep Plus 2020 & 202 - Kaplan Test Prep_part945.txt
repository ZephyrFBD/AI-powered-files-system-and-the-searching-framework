dicated by the release of energy stored in the bonds of glucose.
Because the question specifies that oxygen is required, the process
depicted must show aerobic respiration rather than glycolysis. The
form of energy released in aerobic respiration becomes chemical
energy in the form of ATP, labeled E IV in the diagram. (C) is thus
correct. (A) corresponds to E I in the diagram. (B) is incorrect because
the energy is not being stored (as it is in E III), but rather the energy in
the bonds of glucose is being released. (D) is incorrect because
glycolysis does not require oxygen and because glycolysis occurs in the
cytoplasm, not in an organelle.
22. D
The organelle labeled A is transforming energy via the process of
photosynthesis, a process that occurs in chloroplasts. The organelle
labeled B is transforming energy via cellular respiration, which takes
place in mitochondria. (D) is correct.
23. B
Although both bacteria and protists are capable of photosynthesis,
only photosynthetic proti
