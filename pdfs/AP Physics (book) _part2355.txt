cated, and are able to keep the data even
without power so they are nonvolatile. Each MOSFET contains a second gate (the
floating gate) insulated on both faces, and can hold charge for many years.
Charged or not corresponds to a “1” or a “0” bit. Figure 21–30 is a diagram of
such an NVM (nonvolatile memory) cell. The floating gate is insulated from the
standard gate and the semiconductor connecting source and drain. A high posi-
tive voltage on the gate 
forces electrons in the semiconductor (at 0 V) to
pass through the thin insulator into the floating gate by a process of quantum
mechanical tunneling (discussed in Section 30–12). This charge is stored on the
floating gate as a “1” bit. The erase process is done by applying the opposite
voltage to force electrons to tunnel out of the floating gate, returning it
to the uncharged state (
a “0” bit). The erase process is slow (milliseconds vs. ns
for DRAM), so erasure is done in large blocks of memory. Flash memory† is
slower to read or w
