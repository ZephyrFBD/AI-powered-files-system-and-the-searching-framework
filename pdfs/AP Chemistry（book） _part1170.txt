Visualizing Concepts
 
7.1  As discussed in the text, we can draw an analogy between the 
attraction of an electron to a nucleus and the act of perceiv-
ing light from a light bulb through a frosted glass shade, as 
shown in the illustration.
 
7.6  Shown below is a qualitative diagram of the atomic orbital 
energies for an Na atom. The number of orbitals i
