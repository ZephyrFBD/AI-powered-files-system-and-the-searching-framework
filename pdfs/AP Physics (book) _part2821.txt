his factor
appears because the width of a circular hole is not uniform (like a rectangular slit)
but varies from its diameter D to zero. A mathematical analysis shows that the
“average” width is 
1.22. Hence we get the equation above rather than Eq. 24–3.
The intensity of light in the diffraction pattern from a point source of light passing
through a circular opening is shown in Fig.25–30. The image for a non-point source
is a superposition of such patterns. For most purposes we need consider only the
central spot, since the concentric rings are so much dimmer.
If two point objects are very close, the diffraction patterns of their images
will overlap as shown in Fig. 25–29b. As the objects are moved closer, a separation
is reached where you can’t tell if there are two overlapping images or a single image.
The separation at which this happens may be judged differently by different obser-
vers. However, a generally accepted criterion is that proposed by Lord Rayleigh
(1842–1919). This Ra
