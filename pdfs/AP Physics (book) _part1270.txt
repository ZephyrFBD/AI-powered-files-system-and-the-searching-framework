The pitch of a sound refers to whether it is high, like the sound of a piccolo or
violin, or low, like the sound of a bass drum or string bass. The physical quantity
that determines pitch is the frequency, as was first noted by Galileo. The lower the
frequency, the lower the pitch; the higher the frequency, the higher the pitch.â€  The
best human ears can respond to frequencies from about 20 Hz to almost 20,000 Hz.
(Recall that 1 Hz is 1cycle per second.) This frequency range is called the audible range.
These limits vary somewhat from one individual to another. One general trend is
that as people age, they are less able to hear high frequencies, so the high-frequency
limit may be 10,000 Hz or less.
Sound waves whose frequencies are outside the audible range may reach the
ear, but we are not generally aware of them. Frequencies above 20,000 Hz are called
ultrasonic (do not confuse with supersonic, which is used for an object moving with
a speed faster than the s
