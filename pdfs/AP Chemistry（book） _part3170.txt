both sides. In essence, what you are doing is “neutralizing” the protons to form 
water 1H+ + OH- ¡ H2O2 on the side containing H+, and the other side ends up with 
the OH-. The resulting water molecules can be canceled as needed.
6 e- + 14 H+1aq2 + Cr2O7
2-1aq2 ¡ 2 Cr3+1aq2 + 7 H2O1l2 
We then balance the charge by adding elec-
trons to the left side of the equation so that 
the total charge is the same on the two sides:
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
If you complete and balance the following equation in acidic 
solution
Mn2+1aq2 + NaBiO31s2 ¡ Bi3+1aq2 + MnO4
-1aq2 + Na+1aq2
how many water molecules are there in the balanced equation 
(for the reaction balanced with the smallest whole-number 
coefficients)? (a) Four on the reactant side (b) Three on the 
product side (c) One on the reactant side (d) Seven on the 
product side (e) Two on the product side
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
