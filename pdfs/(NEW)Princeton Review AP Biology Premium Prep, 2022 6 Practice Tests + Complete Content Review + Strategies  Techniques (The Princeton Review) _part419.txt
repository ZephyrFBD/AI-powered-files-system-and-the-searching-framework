BEHAVIOR
Some animals behave in a programmed way to specific stimuli, while others behave according to some type of
learning. We humans can do both. For the AP Biology Exam, you’ll have to know a little about these different types
of behavior—that is, how organisms cope with their environments.
Instinct
Instinct is an inborn, unlearned behavior. Sometimes the instinctive behavior is triggered by environmental signals
called releasers. The releaser is usually a small part of the environment that is perceived. For example, when a male
European robin sees another male robin, the sight of a tuft of red feathers on the male is a releaser that triggers
fighting behavior. In fact, because instinct underlies all other behavior, it can be thought of as the circuitry that
guides behavior.
For example, hive insects, such as bees and termites, never learn their roles; they are born knowing them. On the
basis of this inborn knowledge, or instinct, they carry out all their other behaviors: a worke
