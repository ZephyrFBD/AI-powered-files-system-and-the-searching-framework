these organisms,
release the sulfur back into the atmosphere as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas.

Figure 37.23 At this sulfur vent in Lassen Volcanic National Park in northeastern California, the yellowish sulfur
deposits are visible near the mouth of the vent.
Sulfur enters the ocean via runoff from land, from atmospheric fallout, and from underwater geothermal vents. Some
ecosystems (Figure 37.9) rely on chemoautotrophs using sulfur as a biological energy source. This sulfur then supports
marine ecosystems in the form of sulfates.
Human activities have played a major role in altering the balance of the global sulfur cycle. The burning of large quantities
of fossil fuels, especially from coal, releases larger amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas into the atmosphere. As rain falls
through this gas, it creates the phenomenon known as acid rain. Acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to
the ground through sulfur dioxide gas, turning it into weak sulfuri
