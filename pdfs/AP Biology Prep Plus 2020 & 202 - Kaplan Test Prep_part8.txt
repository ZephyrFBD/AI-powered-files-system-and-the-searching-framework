ng free-response” means roughly the same thing as “large,
multi-step, and involved.” Although the two long free-response questions
are worth a significant amount each and are broken into multiple parts,
they usually don’t cover an obscure topic. Instead, they take a fairly basic
biology concept and ask you several questions about it. Sometimes
diagrams are required or experiments must be set up properly. It’s a lot of
biology work, but it is fundamental biology work. The short free-
response items are typically illustrative examples or concepts that you
are expected to explain or analyze, providing appropriate scientific
evidence and reasoning. A typical response for the short free-response
items will be about a paragraph or two in length. You have approximately
20 minutes for each of the long free-response questions and 10 minutes
for each of the short-response questions.
