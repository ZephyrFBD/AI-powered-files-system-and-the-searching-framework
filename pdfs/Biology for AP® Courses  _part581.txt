ractile vacuoles. This vesicle collects excess water from the cell and pumps it out, keeping the cell from lysing as it
takes on water from its environment (Figure 5.15).

magnification, continuously pumps water out of the organism’s body to keep it from bursting in a hypotonic medium.

Many marine invertebrates have internal salt levels matched to their environments, making them isotonic with the water
in which they live. Fish, however, must spend approximately five percent of their metabolic energy maintaining osmotic
homeostasis. Freshwater fish live in an environment that is hypotonic to their cells. These fish actively take in salt through
their gills and excrete diluted urine to rid themselves of excess water. Saltwater fish live in the reverse en
