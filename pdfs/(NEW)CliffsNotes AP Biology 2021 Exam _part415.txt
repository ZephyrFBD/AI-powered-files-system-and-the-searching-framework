ral selection can change allele frequencies and thus cause evolution.
These factors, together with natural selection, are given here: 1. Natural selection is the increase or decrease in
allele frequencies due
to the impact of the environment.
2. Mutations introduce new alleles that may provide a selective advantage. In general, however, most mutations are
deleterious, or harmful.
3. Gene flow describes the movement of individuals between populations resulting in the removal of alleles from a
population when they leave (emigration) or the introduction of alleles when they enter (immigration).
4. Genetic drift is a random increase or decrease of alleles. In other words, some alleles may increase or decrease
for no other reason than by chance. When populations are small (usually fewer than 100 individuals), the effect of
genetic drift can be very strong and can dramatically influence evolution.
An analogy of genetic drift can be made with the chances associated with flipping a coin. If a
