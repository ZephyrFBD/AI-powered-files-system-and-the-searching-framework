NA, which is represented by step 3.
Step 1 represents DNA replication, so choice (A) is incorrect. Transcription is represented by step 2, so choice
(B) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because step 4 represents translation.
7. (C) If tRNAs could not bind to the ribosome, the initiation of translation could not occur. Choices (A) and (B)
are incorrect because transcription and exon splicing do not involve the ribosome, so an antibiotic that interferes
with ribosomes would not affect those processes. The export of proteins from the cell involves the Golgi bodies
and vesicles, so choice (D) is incorrect.
8. (D) Retroviruses use reverse transcriptase to make a DNA copy of their RNA genome. Reverse transcriptase
has a very high error rate, so many mutations occur.
9. (B) Eukaryotes can use alternative splicing of exons to generate multiple mRNA transcripts from one gene,
which can lead to the production of multiple proteins from one gene. Humans do not acquire new genes when
infected
