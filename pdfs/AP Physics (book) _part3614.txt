All hadrons are considered to be made up of combinations of quarks (plus
the gluons that hold them together), and their properties are described by look-
ing at their quark content. Mesons consist of a quark–antiquark pair. For
example, a 
meson is a 
combination: note that for the 
pair (Table 32–3),

Baryons, on the other hand, consist of three quarks. For example, a neutron

See Fig. 32–16. Strange parti-
cles all contain an s or quark, whereas charm particles contain a c or 
quark.
A few of these hadrons are listed in Table 32–4.
Current models suggest that quarks may be so tightly bound together that
they may not ever exist singly in the free state. But quarks can be detected
indirectly when they turn into narrow jets of other particles, as in Fig. 32–15.
