f consistency and student understanding. The Pearson 
team is a first-class operation.
There are many others who also deserve special recognition, 
including the following: Mary Tindle, our production editor, 
who skillfully kept the process moving and us authors on track; 
and Roxy Wilson (University of Illinois), who so ably coordi-
nated the difficult job of working out solutions to the end-of-
chapter exercises. Finally, we wish to thank our families and 
friends for their love, support, encouragement, and patience as 
we brought this fourteenth edition to completion.
