following best describes the genotypes of 
individual family members in the pedigree? 
(A) All affected individuals possess at least one 
dominant allele of the hemoglobin beta 
gene.  
(B) Healthy individuals may possess one mutant 
allele (HbS) of the hemoglobin beta gene. 
(C) Individuals IV and V must be heterozygous 
for the HbS (mutant) allele. 
(D) Individuals II and VI possess two copies of 
the HbA (wild-type) allele. 
 
49. The HbS allele, which causes sickle-cell disease, 
results from a mutation in the DNA sequence 
shown in Figure 2 that produces a valine (val) in 
the place of a glutamic acid (glu) residue in the 
hemoglobin protein. Which of the following 
mRNA sequences is derived from the  
HbS allele? 
(A) 5′ GAC TGA GGA CTC CTC TTC AGA 3′ 
(B) 5′ UCU GAA GAG GAA UCC UCA GUC 3′ 
(C) 5′ AGA CTT CTC CTC AGG AGT CAG 3′ 
(D) 5′ CUG ACU CCU GUG GAG AAG UCU 3′ 
 
50. The restriction endonuclease Mst II recognizes  
the sequence 5′ CCT(N)AG (where N = any 
nucleotide) and cu
