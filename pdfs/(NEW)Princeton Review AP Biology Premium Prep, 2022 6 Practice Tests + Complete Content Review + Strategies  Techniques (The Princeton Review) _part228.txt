 a process
called cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is a process of breaking down sugar and making ATP.
In autotrophs, the sugar is made during photosynthesis. In heterotrophs, glucose comes from the food we eat. We
will start by going over photosynthesis, since in plants it is a precursor to cellular respiration.
PHOTOSYNTHESIS
Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria are producers. The earliest photosynthesis was conducted by prokaryotic
cyanobacteria, and later eukaryotes developed photosynthetic abilities. All they do is bask in the Sun, churning out
the glucose necessary for life. In this section, we’ll focus on how plants conduct photosynthesis.
Algae are a diverse group of aquatic, eukaryotic organisms that can perform
photosynthesis. Most algae are protists. Some common examples are
seaweed (such as kelp or phytoplankton), pond scum, or algal blooms in
lakes.
As we discussed earlier, photosynthesis is the process by which light energy is converted to chemical energy. Here’s
an
