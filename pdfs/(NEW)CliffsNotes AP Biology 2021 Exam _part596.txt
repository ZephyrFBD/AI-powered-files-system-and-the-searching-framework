Animal Reproduction and Development
Review
The term reproduction describes the production of eggs and sperm and the processes leading to fertilization. The
term development describes the sequence of events that transform a fertilized egg into a multicellular organism and
the changes that occur as the organism ages.
Most of what you need to know about reproduction and development involves processes that have already been
discussed in earlier chapters but can serve as additional examples that you can cite to show your understanding of a
concept. For example, the production of eggs and sperm is an example of mitosis and meiosis. In addition, its
regulation is an example of the endocrine system and of negative and positive feedback mechanisms. Development,
as a highly coordinated series of cell divisions and programmed cell deaths, is an important example of cell
communication
