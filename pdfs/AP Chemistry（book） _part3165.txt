tep 1). 
 
One half-reaction must have Mn on both sides of the arrow, and the other must have C 
on both sides of the arrow:
MnO4
-1aq2 ¡ Mn2+1aq2
C2O4
2-1aq2 ¡ CO21g2
We next complete and balance each half-reaction. First, we balance all the atoms 
except H and O (Step 2a). In the permanganate half-reaction, we have one manga-
nese atom on each side of the equation and so need to do nothing. In the oxalate half- 
reaction, we add a coefficient 2 on the right to balance the two carbons on the left:
MnO4
-1aq2 ¡ Mn2+1aq2
C2O4
2-1aq2 ¡ 2 CO21g2
Next we balance O (Step 2b). The permanganate half-reaction has four oxygens on the left 
and none on the right; to balance these four oxygen atoms, we add four H2O molecules on 
the right:
MnO4
-1aq2 ¡ Mn2+1aq2 + 4 H2O1l2
The eight hydrogen atoms now in the products must be balanced by adding 8 H+ to the 
reactants (Step 2c):
 
8 H+1aq2 + MnO4
-1aq2 ¡ Mn2+1aq2 + 4 H2O1l2
