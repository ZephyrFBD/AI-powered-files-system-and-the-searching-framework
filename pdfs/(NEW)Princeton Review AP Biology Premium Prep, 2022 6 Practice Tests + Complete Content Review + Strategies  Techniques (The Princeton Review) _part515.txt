stimulus. Movement toward a stimulus is
called positive taxis, while movement away from a stimulus is negative taxis. In this lab, fruit flies exhibited a
negative gravitaxis (or a movement opposite to the force of gravity) and positive phototaxis (a movement
toward a light source).
LAB 13: ENZYME ACTIVITY
This lab demonstrates how an enzyme catalyzes a reaction and what can influence rates of catalysis. In this lab, the
enzyme peroxidase is used to catalyze the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen.

The following are the major concepts you need to understand for the AP Exam:
Enzymes are proteins that increase the rate of biological reactions. They accomplish this by lowering the
activation energy of the reaction.
Enzymes have active sites, which are pockets that the substrates (reactants) can enter that are specific to one
substrate or set of substrates.
Enzymes have optimal temperature and pH ranges at which they catalyze react
