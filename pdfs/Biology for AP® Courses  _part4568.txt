eld tests in which video cameras are set up
to record predators capturing dull individuals
and brightly colored individuals in their native
territories.

Run laboratory tests in which predators familiar
with the poisonous snake are offered dull
individuals and brightly colored individuals to
see if the predators show a preference.
d.
Run laboratory tests in which predators familiar
with the dull colored non-poisonous snake are

98. Frogs are amphibians and spend time both on land and
in water. Female frogs are vulnerable to predation by fish
when they enter the water to lay eggs. A hypothesis has
been proposed that frogs rely on chemical detection of
predators in addition to visual detection. In other words,
frogs detect the presence of predator fish by chemicals
released by fish into the water. Design an experiment to
test this hypothesis.
