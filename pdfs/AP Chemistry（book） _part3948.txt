nter 46.8 and press the LN key.
ln 46.8 = 3.846
The natural antilog of a number is e raised to a power equal to that number. If your 
calculator can calculate natural logs, it will also be able to calculate natural antilogs. On 
some calculators there is a key labeled ex that allows you to calculate natural antilogs 
directly; on others, it will be necessary to first press the INV key followed by the LN key. 
For example, the natural antilog of 1.679 is given by
Natural antilog 1.679 = e1.679 = 5.36
The relation between common and natural logarithms is as follows:
ln a = 2.303 log a
Notice that the factor relating the two, 2.303, is the natural log of 10, which we cal-
culated earlier.
Mathematical Operations Using Logarithms
Because logarithms are exponents, mathematical operations involving logarithms follow 
the rules for the use of exponents. For example, the product of za and zb (where z is any 
number) is given by
za # zb = z1a+b2
Similarly, the logarithm (either common or natura
