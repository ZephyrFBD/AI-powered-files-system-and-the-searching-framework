pray for him.
FAUSTUS. Ay, pray for me, pray for me; and what noise soever you
hear, come not unto me, for nothing can rescue me.
SECOND SCHOLAR. Pray thou, and we will pray that God may have
mercy upon thee.
FAUSTUS. Gentlemen, farewell:  if I live till morning, I'll visit you;
if not, Faustus is gone to hell.
ALL. Faustus, farewell. [Exeunt SCHOLARS.]
MEPHIST. Ay, Faustus, now thou hast no hope of heaven; Therefore
despair; think only upon hell, For that must be thy mansion, there to dwell.
FAUSTUS. O thou bewitching fiend, 'twas thy temptation Hath robb'd
me of eternal happiness!
MEPHIST. I do confess it, Faustus, and rejoice: 'Twas I that, when
thou wert i'the way to heaven, Damm'd up thy passage; when thou took'st
the book To view the Scriptures, then I turn'd the leaves, And led thine
eye.<251> What, weep'st thou? 'tis too late; despair!  Farewell: Fools that
will laugh on earth must weep in hell. [Exit.]<252>
