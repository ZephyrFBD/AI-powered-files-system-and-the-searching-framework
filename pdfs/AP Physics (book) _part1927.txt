37. (I) How much charge flows from each terminal of a 12.0-V
battery when it is connected to a 
capacitor?
38. (I) A 0.20-F capacitor is desired. What area must the plates
have if they are to be separated by a 3.2-mm air gap?
39. (II) The charge on a capacitor increases by 
when the
voltage across it increases from 97 V to 121 V. What is the
capacitance of the capacitor?
40. (II) An electric field of 
is desired between
two parallel plates, each of area 
and separated by
2.45 mm of air. What charge must be on each plate?
41. (II) If a capacitor has opposite 
charges on the plates,
and an electric field of 2.0
is desired between the
plates, what must each plate’s area be?
42. (II) It takes 18 J of energy to move a 0.30-mC charge from
one plate of a 
capacitor to the other. How much
charge is on each plate?
43. (II) To get an idea how big a farad is, suppose you want to
make a 1-F
