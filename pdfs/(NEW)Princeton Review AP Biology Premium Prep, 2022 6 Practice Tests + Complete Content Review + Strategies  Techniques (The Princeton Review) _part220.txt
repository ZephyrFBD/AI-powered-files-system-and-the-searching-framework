 way of helping reactions along. As we just saw, the reactants in an enzyme-assisted reaction
are known as substrates. During a reaction, the enzyme’s job is to bring the transition state about by helping the
substrate(s) get into position. It accomplishes this through a special region on the enzyme known as an active site.
The enzyme temporarily binds one or more of the substrates to its active site and forms an enzyme-substrate
complex. In general, the structure of the substrate—specifically its shape and charge—must be compatible with the
active site of the enzyme in order for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction to occur. Let’s take a look:
Once the reaction has occurred and the product is formed, the enzyme is released from the complex and restored to
its original state. Now the enzyme is free to react again with another bunch of substrates.
By binding and releasing substrates over and over again, the enzyme speeds the reaction along, enabling the cell to
release much-needed energy from
