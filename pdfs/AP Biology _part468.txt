 2 = 6.25 g. You divided 4 times
to get from 100.0 g to 6.25 g. This means that 4 half-lives passed to leave
6.25 g remaining from the original 100.0 g.
Now, divide your original 96.4 days by 4 (number of half-lives) = 24.1
days. Therefore, the half-life of thorium-234 is 24.1 days.
CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter covered Big Ideas: EVO and SYI.
Evidence for evolution comes from various scientific fields: fossil
record, comparative anatomy, comparative biochemistry,
comparative embryology, molecular biology, and biogeography.
According to Darwin’s theory of natural selection, populations tend
to grow and exceed their limited resources. Competition for those
limited resources results in differential survival. Individuals with
more favorable phenotypes are more likely to survive to produce
offspring, passing their genes to subsequent generations. Fittest is
defined only in terms of reproductive success, not necessarily the
