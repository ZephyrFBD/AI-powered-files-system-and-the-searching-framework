tron atom, the energies of orbitals with the same n value 
increase with increasing l value. For example, in the carbon atom, whose electron con-
figuration is 1s22s22p2, the energy of the 2p orbital 1l = 12 is higher than that of the 2s 
orbital 1l = 02, even though both orbitals are in the n = 2 shell (Figure 6.25). This differ-
ence in energies is due to the radial probability functions for the orbitals (Figure 7.4). We 
see first that the 1s electrons are much closer to the nucleus—they serve as an effective 
“lampshade” for the 2s and 2p electrons. Notice next that the 2s probability function has 
a small peak fairly close to the nucleus, whereas the 2p probability function does not. As 
a result, a 2s electron is not screened as much by the core orbitals as is a 2p electron. The 
greater attraction between the 2s electron and the nucleus leads to a lower energy for the 
2s orbital than for the 2p orbital. The same reasoning explains the general trend in orbital
