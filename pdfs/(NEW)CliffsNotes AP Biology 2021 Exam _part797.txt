istances and known fragment
sizes for the standard sample. The standard curve is a plot of fragment size (base pairs) against migration distance.
Since migration distance is inversely proportional to fragment size, plotting migration distance against the log of the
number of base pairs produces a straight line.
8. Use the standard curve to determine the size of each fragment produced by the sample under investigation.
Investigation 10: Energy Dynamics
The primary productivity of a community is a measure of the amount of biomass produced by autotrophs through
photosynthesis (or chemosynthesis) per unit of time. Primary productivity can be determined
by measuring the rate at which CO2is consumed, O2is produced, or
 
biomass is stored. In this investigation, primary productivity is determined by the amount of biomass produced by
plants.
 
Primary productivity can be examined with respect to the following factors. (Note that the term rate means per unit
time.)
1. Gross primary productivity
