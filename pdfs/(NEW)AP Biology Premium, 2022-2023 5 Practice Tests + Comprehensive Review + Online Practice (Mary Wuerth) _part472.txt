enotype is equal to p2 + 2pq, which would
give you an equation with two unknowns and is not solvable. In this situation, subtract the frequency of the dominant phenotype from 1 to obtain the
frequency of the recessive phenotype. Since only one genotype can produce the recessive phenotype, the frequency of the recessive phenotype equals
q2, which gives you an equation with just one unknown and is solvable.
Since 82% of the population has erect ears, 100 – 82 = 18% of the population must have drooping ears
(the recessive phenotype). Therefore, q2 = 0.18, and q = 0.42. Subtracting q from 1 gives the value of p: p = 1
– 0.42 = 0.58. The frequency of heterozygotes then becomes 2pq = 2(0.58)(0.42) = 0.49, or 49%.
3. In dogs, black fur is dominant to brown fur. In a population of dogs that is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
10% of the individuals have brown fur. What is the frequency of the allele for black fur, and what percentage
of the population possesses at least one copy of the allele fo
