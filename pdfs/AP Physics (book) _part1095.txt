(reciprocating type): the intake
valve opens and air (or fluid that is
being pumped) fills the empty space
when the piston moves to the left.
When the piston moves to the right
(not shown), the outlet valve opens
and fluid is forced out.

FIGURE 10–41 Pumping human heart. (a) In
the diastole phase, the heart relaxes between
beats. Blood moves into the heart; both atria
fill rapidly. (b) When the atria contract, the
systole or pumping phase begins. The
contraction pushes the blood through the
mitral and tricuspid valves into the ventricles.
(c) The contraction of the ventricles forces
the blood through the semilunar valves into
the pulmonary artery, which leads to the
lungs, and to the aorta (the body’s largest
artery), whi
