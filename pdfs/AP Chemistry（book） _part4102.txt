 = 0), do not involve a change in 
oxidation state for oxygen atoms. Reactions involving ClO and one of 
the oxygen species with a zero oxidation state do involve a change in 
the oxidation state of oxygen atoms. 18.25 (a) A chloroﬂuorocarbon 
is a compound that contains chlorine, ﬂuorine, and carbon, while 
a hydroﬂuorocarbon is a compound that contains hydrogen, ﬂuo-
rine, and carbon. An HFC contains hydrogen in place of the chlorine 
present in a CFC. (b) HFCs are potentially less harmful to the ozone 
layer than CFCs because their photodissociation does not produce Cl 
atoms, which catalyze the destruction of ozone. 18.27 (a) The maxi-
mum wavelength of a single photon that will break a C ¬F bond is 
247 nm. The maximum wavelength of a single photon that will break
