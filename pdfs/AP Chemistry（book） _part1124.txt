 is slightly basic. When a piece of solid carbon dioxide (“dry ice”) 
is added, the color changes to yellow, indicating an acidic solution. The mist is water droplets 
condensed from the air by cold CO2 gas that sublimes off before reacting.
Give It Some Thought
A compound ACI3 (A is an element) has a melting point of -112 °C. Would you 
expect the compound to be molecular or ionic? If you were told that A is either 
scandium or phosphorus, which do you think is the more likely choice?

CHAPTER 7 Periodic Properties of the Elements
Metalloids
Metalloids have properties intermediate between those of metals and those of non-
metals. They may have some characteristic metallic properties but lack others. For 
example, the metalloid silicon looks like a metal (Figure 7.19), but it is brittle rather 
than malleable and does not conduct heat or electricity nearly as well as metals do.
Several metalloids, most notably silicon, are ele
