soln2. 
We can calculate the values of ∆H°
soln and ∆S°
soln by using 
Equations 5.31 and 19.8. We can then calculate -T∆S°
soln at 
T = 298 K. The results are summarized in the following table:

The entropy terms for the solution of the two salts are very 
similar. That seems sensible because each solution process 
should lead to a similar increase in randomness as the salt dis-
solves, forming hydrated ions. 
 (Section 13.1) In contrast, 
we see a very large difference in the enthalpy term for the 
solution of the two salts. The difference in the values of ∆G°
soln 
is dominated by the difference in the values of ∆H°
soln.
(c) The solubility product, Ksp, is the equilibrium constant for the 
solution process. 
 (Section 17.4) As such, we can relate Ksp 
directly to ∆G°
soln by using Equation 19.21:
Ksp = e-∆G°
so

We can ca
