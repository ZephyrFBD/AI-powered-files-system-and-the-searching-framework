 many kinds of tissue and are the main components of muscle, tendons, 
and hair. The largest known proteins, in excess of 27,000 amino acids long, are muscle 
proteins.
The tertiary structure of a protein is maintained by many different interactions. Certain 
foldings of the protein chain lead to lower energy (more stable) arrangements than do other 
folding patterns. For example, a globular protein dissolved in aqueous solution folds in such a

▲ Figure 24.18 The four levels of protein structure. Amino acids, linked by amide bonds from the amine  
end to the acid end, can hydrogen-bond to form alpha helix or beta sheet secondary structures. These  
secondary structures fold into tertiary structures based on electrostatic and van der Waals interactions.  
Many proteins for quaternary structures in which multiple protein molecules associate to form dimers,  
trimers,
