has the potential to produce the most virions.
a.
The lytic cycle can theoretically produce more
virions as the viral genome is incorporated into
the host cell’s genome replicating along with the
host cell.
b.
The lysogenic cycle can theoretically produce
more virions as the reproductive cycle of viruses
undergoing lysogeny is much faster than the
reproductive cycle of viruses following lytic
cycle.
c.
The lysogenic cycle can theoretically produce
more virions as the viral genome is incorporated
into the host cell’s genome replicating along
with the host cell.
d.
The lytic cycle can theoretically produce more
virions as the prophage following lysogenic
cycle ultimately gets excised from the host cell’s
genome and enter the lytic cycle.
34. Would a person who has never been in contact with the
varicella-zoster virus be at risk of developing chickenpox
or shingles if they come in close contact with a person
with shingles? Explain your reasoning.
