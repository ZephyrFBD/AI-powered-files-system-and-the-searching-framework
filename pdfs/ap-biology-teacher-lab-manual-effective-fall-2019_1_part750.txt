jectives for the investigation and develop strategies (e.g., 
questions or activities) that can help determine whether or not the learning objective 
has been met. For example, one learning objective is The student is able to analyze 
data to identify possible patterns and relationships between a biotic or abiotic factor 
and a biological system (2D1 and 5.1). The student might be asked to complete a 
data grid of choice for fruit flies, analyze the data, and draw conclusions. Table 1 is 
an example of a data table that students could construct for themselves as they use 
the choice chamber (x = number of flies at one of the two ends of the chamber). The 
students may need to adjust the table to indicate multiple trials.
