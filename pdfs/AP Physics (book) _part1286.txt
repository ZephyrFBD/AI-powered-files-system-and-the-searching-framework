The Ear’s Response
The ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies. To hear the same loudness for
sounds of different frequencies requires different intensities. Studies on large
numbers of people have produced the averaged curves shown in Fig. 12–6 (top of
next page). On this graph, each curve represents sounds that seemed to be equally
loud. The number labeling each curve represents the loudness level (the units are
called phons), which is numerically equal to the sound level in dB at 1000 Hz. For
example, the curve labeled 40 represents sounds that are heard by an average
person to have the same loudness as a 1000-Hz sound with a sound level of 40 dB.
From this 40-phon curve, we see that a 100-Hz tone must be at a level of about
62 dB to be perceived as loud as a 1000-Hz tone of only 40 dB.

function of frequency, for the threshold of
