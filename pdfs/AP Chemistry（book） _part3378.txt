Because a living plant or animal has a constant intake of carbon compounds, it is 
able to maintain a ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 that is nearly identical with that of the 
atmosphere. Once the organism dies, however, it no longer ingests carbon compounds

to replenish the carbon-14 lost through radioactive decay. The ratio of carbon-14 to 
carbon-12 therefore decreases. By measuring this ratio and comparing it with that of 
the atmosphere, we can estimate the age of an object. For example, if the ratio dimin-
ishes to half that of the atmosphere, we can conclude that the object is one half-life, or 
 
5700 yr, old.
This method cannot be used to date objects older than about 50,000 yr because after 
this length of time the radioacti
