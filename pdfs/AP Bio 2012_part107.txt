udent can use representations to describe how 
gene regulation influences cell products and function.
(A)
This option is incorrect because lactose has bonded with the repressor protein, 
resulting in its release from the operator. This will allow RNA polymerase to 
transcribe the lac operon because the molecular barrier no longer exists.
(B)
This option is incorrect because if lactose did bind with the repressor protein, then 
it would result in a conformational change and the repressor protein would no 
longer bind to the operator portion of the operon. No transcription would occur.
(C)
This option is incorrect because with no repressor in place, the operon would be 
turned on, and the genes would be transcribed.
(D)
This option is correct because the lac operon is an inducible operon, which 
means that the regulatory system is turned off until lactose or its analog turns 
it on. The mechanism for preventing its transcription is the binding of a 
repressor protein to the operator regi
