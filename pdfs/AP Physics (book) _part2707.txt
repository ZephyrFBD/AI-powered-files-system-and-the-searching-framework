rther reduced according to Eq. 24–5,
and the plane of polarization is then along the axis of the second Polaroid.
SOLUTION The first Polaroid eliminates half the light, so the intensity is
reduced by half:
The light reaching the second polarizer is vertically
polarized and so is reduced in intensity (Eq. 24–5) to
Thus,
The transmitted light has an intensity one-eighth that of the
original and is plane-polarized at a 60° angle to the vertical.
Three Polaroids. We saw in Fig. 24–43
that when unpolarized light falls on two crossed Polaroids (axes at 90°), no light
passes through. What happens if a third Polaroid, with axis at 45° to each of the
other two, is placed between them (Fig. 24–45a)?
RESPONSE We start just as in Example 24–13 and recall again that light
emerging from each Polaroid is polarized parallel to that Polaroid’s axis. Thus
the angle in Eq. 24–5 is that between the transmission axes of each pair of
Polaroids taken in turn. The first Polaroid changes the unpolarized light
