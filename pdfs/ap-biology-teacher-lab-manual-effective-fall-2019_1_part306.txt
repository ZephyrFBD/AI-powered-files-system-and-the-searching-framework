n instead of the protein? 
•  Can you diagram the flow of water based upon the contents of your model cell and 
the surrounding solution? 
•  When will the net osmosis rate equal zero in your model cells? 
•  Based upon your observations, can you predict the direction of osmosis in living cells 
when the cells are placed in various solutions? 
•  How is the dialysis tubing functionally different from a cellular membrane? 
■ Designing and Conducting Independent Investigations 
Have students design five different pairs of solutions and make a prediction about 
diffusion; one pair — water in the dialysis tube placed into water — is the control. 
Have groups of students do replicate experiments. Students are surprised that the tube 
containing 5% albumin has no weight change when placed in water. 
Procedure 3: Observing Osmosis in Living Cells 
It is important that students observe and understand osmosis in living cells. A quick 
demonstration is to soak celery sticks in water and in 1 M N
