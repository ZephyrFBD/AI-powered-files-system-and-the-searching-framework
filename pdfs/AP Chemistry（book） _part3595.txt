 is less electronegative than H, the B¬H bond in these com-
pounds is polarized, with H having the higher electron density. The simplest borane is 
BH3. This molecule contains only six valence electrons and is therefore an exception to 
the octet rule. As a result, BH3 reacts with itself to form diborane 1B2H62. This reaction can 
be viewed as a Lewis acid–base reaction in which one B¬H bonding pair of electrons in 
each BH3 molecule is donated to the other. As a result, diborane is an unusual molecule 
in which hydrogen atoms form a bridge between two B atoms (Figure 22.34). Such hydro-
gens are called bridging hydrogens.
Sharing hydrogen atoms between the two boron atoms compensates somewhat for the 
deficiency in valence electrons around each boron. Nevertheless, diborane is an extremely 
reactive molecule, spontaneously flammable in air in a highly exothermic reaction:
 
B2H61g2 + 3 O21g2 ¡ B2O31s2 + 3 H2O1g2  ∆H° = -2030 kJ
