Distance from a lightning strike. A rule
of thumb that tells how close lightning has struck is “one mile for every five seconds
before the thunder is heard.” Explain why this works, noting that the speed of
light is so high (
almost a million times faster than sound) that the
time for light to travel to us is negligible compared to the time for the sound.
RESPONSE The speed of sound in air is about 
so to travel
takes about 3 seconds. One mile is about 1.6 kilometers, so the
time for the thunder to travel a mile is about (1.6)(3) L 5 seconds.
1 km = 1000 m

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 12;1
Two aspects of any sound are immediately evident to a human listener:
“loudness” and “pitch.” Each refers to a sensation in the consciousness of the 
listener. But to each of these subjective sensations there corresponds a physically
measurable quantity. Loudness is related to the intensity (energy per unit time
crossing unit area) in the sound wave, and we shall discus
