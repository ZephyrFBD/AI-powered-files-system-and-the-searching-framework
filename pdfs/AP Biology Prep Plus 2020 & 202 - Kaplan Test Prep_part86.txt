3. A scientist studying bird migration places bands around the legs
of each bird that visits her research site each year in order to
examine whether increased water temperatures aﬀect survival. In
this way, she is able to document a pattern that larger birds are
increasingly more likely to return than smaller birds. What
conclusion can most reasonably be drawn from these data?

(C)
The birds may cease migrating so that more of them can
survive.
