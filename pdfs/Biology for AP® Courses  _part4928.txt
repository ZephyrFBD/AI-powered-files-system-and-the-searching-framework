r bonds, positively with their abuser.’ An example is hostages
bonding and even ‘falling in love’ with their kidnappers. The
syndrome has been observed in domestic violence, abused children,
concentration camp inmates, prisoners of war and many and various
Satanic cults. These are some traits of Stockholm syndrome listed at
goodtherapy.org:
 
Positive regard towards perpetrators of abuse or captor [see
‘Covid’].
Failure to cooperate with police and other government authorities
when it comes to holding perpetrators of abuse or kidnapping
accountable [or in the case of ‘Covid’ cooperating with the police
to enforce and defend their captors’ demands].
LiĴle or no eﬀort to escape [see ‘Covid’].
Belief in the goodness of the perpetrators or kidnappers [see
‘Covid’].
Appeasement of captors. This is a manipulative strategy for
maintaining one’s safety. As victims get rewarded – perhaps with
less abuse or even with life itself – their appeasing behaviours are
reinforced [see ‘Covid’].
