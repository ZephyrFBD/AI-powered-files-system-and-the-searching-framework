o the point of extinction (the disappearance of a species). In
fact, there were several factors that played a role in the extinction of perhaps 200 cichlid species in Lake Victoria: the Nile
perch, declining lake water quality due to agriculture and land clearing on the shores of Lake Victoria, and increased fishing
pressure. Scientists had not even catalogued all of the species presentâ€”so many were lost that were never named. The
diversity is now a shadow of what it once was.
The cichlids of Lake Victoria are a thumbnail sketch of contemporary rapid species loss that occurs all over Earth and is
caused by human activity. Extinction is a natural process of macroevolution that occurs at the rate of about one out of 1
million species becoming extinct per year. The fossil record reveals that there have been five periods of mass extinction
in history with much higher rates of species loss, and the rate of species loss today is comparable to those periods of
mass extinction. However, there
