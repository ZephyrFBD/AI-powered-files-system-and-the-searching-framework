Figure 6. Onion Root Tip 
Scientists reported that a fungal pathogen may affect the growth of soybeans (Glycine 
max). The soybean growth was decreased during three years of high rainfall. The 
soybean roots were poorly developed. Close relatives of R. anaerobis are plant pathogens 
and grow in the soil. A lectin-like protein, which may be secreted by the fungus, was 
found in soil surrounding the soybean roots. Lectins accelerate mitosis in some root 
apical meristems; however, in many instances, rapid cell division weakens plant tissues. 
We are using onions instead of soybeans since onion root tips are more easily grown and 
studied.
