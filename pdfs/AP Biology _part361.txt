in this way is called complementary DNA
or cDNA.
CRISPR
CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic
Repeats. It is a gene editing tool that gives scientists the ability to change
an organism’s DNA. CRISPR is guided by the enzyme Cas9 to modify a
stretch of DNA. The whole gene editing unit is referred to as CRISPR-
Cas9.
CRISPR-Cas9 was adapted from a naturally occurring genome editing
system in bacteria used for protection against attacking viruses. The
bacteria capture snippets of DNA from invading viruses and use them to
create DNA segments known as CRISPR arrays. These arrays allow the
bacteria to “remember” the viruses (or closely related ones). If the viruses
attack again, the bacteria produce RNA segments from the CRISPR arrays
to target the viruses’ DNA. The bacteria then use Cas9 or a similar enzyme
to cut the DNA apart, disabling the virus.
