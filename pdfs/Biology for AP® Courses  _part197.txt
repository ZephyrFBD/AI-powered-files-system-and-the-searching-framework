dissolve in it. Therefore, water is referred to as a solvent, a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic
compounds. The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water, surrounding the particle
with water molecules. This is referred to as a sphere of hydration, or a hydration shell, as illustrated in Figure 2.16 and
serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water.
When ionic compounds are added to water, the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and
their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation. Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off
from molecules and form ions. Consider table salt (NaCl, or sodium chloride): when NaCl crystals are added to water, the
molecules of NaCl dissociate into Na+ and Clâ€“ ions, and spheres of hydration form around the ions, illustrated in Figure
2.16. The positively charged sodium ion is surrounded by the partially negative c
