other organisms. In cellular respiration, free energy becomes available to drive metabolic 
pathways primarily by the conversion of ADP to ATP. If sufficient oxygen is available, 
glucose may be oxidized completely, as summarized by the following reaction:
C6H12O6  +  6O2(g)  → 6CO2(g)  +  6H2O  +  energy
To determine the rate of cellular respiration, one could measure the consumption 
of O2 during the oxidation of glucose, or the production of CO2. In this investigation, 
students assemble microrespirometers or use gas pressure sensors (probe system) 
to measure the relative volume (changes in pressure) as oxygen is consumed by 
germinating seeds. Once students learn how to measure the rate of cellular respiration, 
questions emerge about the process that leads to independent student investigations 
about factors that might affect the rate. This investigation can be conducted during the 
study of cellular processes, int
