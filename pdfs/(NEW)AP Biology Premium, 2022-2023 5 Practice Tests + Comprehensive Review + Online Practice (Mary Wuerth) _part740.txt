28. (D) Heterozygote advantage occurs when the individuals with the heterozygous genotype have an advantage
over homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive genotypes. In this case, heterozygotes do not have sickle
cell disease and are more resistant to malaria. Choice (A) is incorrect because polygenic inheritance describes
when more than one gene contributes to a trait. Sexual selection occurs when mate choice determines
reproductive success, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (C) is incorrect because sex-linked inheritance occurs
when the gene for a trait is located on a sex chromosome.
29. (C) A person who does not have sickle cell disease but whose parent had sickle cell disease must be
heterozygous. A person with the sickle cell trait is heterozygous, so the child of the two individuals would have
a 50% of having the sickle cell trait, as shown in the figure.
30. (D) Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship where one organism is harmed (the finch nestlings)
