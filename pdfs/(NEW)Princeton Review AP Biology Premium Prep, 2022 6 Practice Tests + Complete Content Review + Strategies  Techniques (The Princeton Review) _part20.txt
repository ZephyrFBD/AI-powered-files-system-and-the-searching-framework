lls makes the organisms’ insides hypotonic.
(C) The organisms’ insides are isotonic since the intracellular osmolality concentrations match the osmolality
concentrations of the tank.
(D) The flow of water into and out of the organisms’ insides causes the cells to be retrotonic.
5. A population of organisms that are not osmoconformers is dropped into the tank with Organism 1. The
intracellular osmolality of Organism 1 begins to slightly decrease. Which of the following could explain this?
(A) The new organisms were hypotonic compared to the tank and they lost water via osmosis.
(B) The new organisms expelled waste products that increased the tank’s osmolality.
(C) The new organism competed with organism 1 for food and caused it to become active.
(D) The new organism ingested large amounts of fluid and the tank fluid level decreased.
