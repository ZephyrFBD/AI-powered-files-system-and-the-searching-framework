▲ Figure 24.16 The 20 amino acids found in the human body. The blue shading shows the different  
R groups for each amino acid. The acids are shown in the zwitterionic form in which they exist in  
water at near-neutral pH values. The amino acid names shown in bold are the nine essential ones.  
Three-letter and one-letter abbreviations for each amino acid are shown below its name.
The a@carbon atom of the amino acids, which is the carbon between the amino 
and carboxylate groups, has four different groups attached to it. The amino acids are 
thus chiral (except for glycine, which has two hydrogens attached to the
