ow NPE of cattle. Thus, there has been a growing movement worldwide to promote the consumption of non-meat and
non-dairy foods so that less energy is wasted feeding animals for the meat industry.
Modeling Ecosystems Energy Flow: Ecological Pyramids
The structure of ecosystems can be visualized with ecological pyramids, which were first described by the pioneering
studies of Charles Elton in the 1920s. Ecological pyramids show the relative amounts of various parameters (such as
number of organisms, energy, and biomass) across trophic levels.
Pyramids of numbers can be either upright or inverted, depending on the ecosystem. As shown in Figure 37.10, typical
grassland during the summer has a base of many plants and the numbers of organisms decrease at each trophic level.
However, during the summer in a temperate forest, the base of the pyramid consists of few trees compared with the number
of primary consumers, mostly insects. Because trees are large, they have great photosynthetic capabi
