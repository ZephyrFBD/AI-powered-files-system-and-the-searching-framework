it is a strong or weak electrolyte: All 
strong acids are strong electrolytes, and all weak acids are weak electrolytes. If an acid is 
not listed in Table 4.2, it is probably a weak acid and therefore a weak electrolyte.
If our substance is a base, we use Table 4.2 to determine whether it is a strong base. 
NH3 is the only molecular base that we consider in this chapter, and it is a weak base; 
Table 4.3 tells us it is therefore a weak electrolyte. Finally, any molecular substance that 
we encounter in this chapter that is not an acid or NH3 is probably a nonelectrolyte.

CHAPTER 4 Reactions in Aqueous Solution
Neutralization Reactions and Salts
The properties of acidic solutions are quite different from those of basic solutions. Acids 
have a sour taste, whereas bases have a bitter taste.* Acids change the colors of certain 
dyes in a way that differs from the way bases affect the same dyes. This is the principle 
behind the indicator known as litmus paper (Figure 4.8). Acid-base
