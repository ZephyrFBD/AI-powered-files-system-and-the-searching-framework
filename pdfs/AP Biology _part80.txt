ent, and the two became one entity. A major piece of evidence for this
theory is that chloroplasts have their own DNA that resembles bacterial
DNA, not eukaryotic nuclear DNA.

It maintains the cell’s shape.
It controls the position of organelles within the cell by anchoring
them to the plasma membrane.
It is involved with the flow of the cytoplasm, known as
cytoplasmic streaming.
It anchors the cell in place by interacting with extracellular
elements.
The cytoskeleton includes microtubules and microfilaments.
Microtubules are hollow tubes made of the protein tubulin that
make up the cilia, flagella, and spindle fibers. Cilia and flagella,
which move cells from one place to another, consist of 9 pairs of
microtubules organized around 2 singlet microtubule
