180° rotation about this
bond when light absorbed
▲ Figure 9.30 The rhodopsin molecule, the chemical basis of vision. When rhodopsin absorbs visible light, the p component of the double bond 
shown in red breaks, allowing rotation that produces a change in molecular geometry before the p bond re-forms. The hexagonal part of the 
structure is a short-hand way of drawing C¬C bonds with attendant H’s. 
Give It Some Thought
When two atoms are bonded by a triple bond, what is the hybridization of the 
orbitals that make up the s-bond component of the bond?

the two atomic orbitals so that the atomic orbital wave functions combine in the region 
between the two nuclei. Because an electron in this MO is attracted to both nuclei, the 
electron is more stable (it has lower energy) than it is in the 1s atomic orbital of an iso-
lated hydrogen atom.
