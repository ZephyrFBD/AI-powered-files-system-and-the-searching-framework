tum number, l = 1, but different values of the 
magnetic quantum number. page 236 In this case we cannot 
unambiguously determine the relative energies of the two orbitals 
because the 4s orbital has a higher value of n, while the 3d orbital 
has a higher value of l, and the energies of electrons in multielectron 
atoms depend upon both quantum numbers. page 241 The 6s 
orbital, which starts to hold electrons at element 55, Cs. page 245 
We canâ€™t conclude anything! Each of the three elements has a differ-
ent valence electron configuration for its 1n - 12d and ns subshells: 
For Ni, 3d84s2; for Pd, 4d10; and for Pt, 5d96s1.

atomic numbers. page 262 The 2p electron in a Ne atom would
