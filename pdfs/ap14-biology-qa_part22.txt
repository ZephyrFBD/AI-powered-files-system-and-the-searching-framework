Teachers should give students the opportunity to compare the strategies that different organisms use to 
respond to various environmental challenges (e.g., temperature, light). Teachers should also take every 
opportunity to connect physiological mechanism to evolutionary biology (i.e., asking students how natural 
selection has resulted in diverse homeostatic mechanisms). 
Question 8 
What was the intent of this question? 
Question 8 asks students to refine evidence from hypothetical data to explain how genetic variation 
contributes to the process of evolution. Students were presented with a description of a strain of fruit flies 
that has been engineered to eliminate errors during DNA replication. Students were asked to provide 
evidence that would indicate new genetic variation has occurred in the engineered flie
