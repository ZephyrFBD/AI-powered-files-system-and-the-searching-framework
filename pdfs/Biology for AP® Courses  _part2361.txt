cell Enveloped animal viruses may bud from the cell membrane as they assemble themselves, taking a piece of the cellâ€™s
plasma membrane in the process. On the other hand, non-enveloped viral progeny, such as rhinoviruses, accumulate in
infected cells until there is a signal for lysis or apoptosis, and all virions are released together.
As you will learn in the next module, animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases. Some of them follow
the classic pattern of acute disease, where symptoms get increasingly worse for a short period followed by the elimination
of the virus from the body by the immune system and eventual recovery from the infection. Examples of acute viral
diseases are the common cold and influenza. Other viruses cause long-term chronic infections, such as the virus causing
hepatitis C, whereas others, like herpes simplex virus, only cause intermittent symptoms. Still other viruses, such as
human herpesviruses 6 and 7, which in some case
