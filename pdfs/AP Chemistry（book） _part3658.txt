ink spin–spin interactions of unpaired electrons on adjacent atoms in 
a substance are affected by the interatomic distance?
Ferromagnets, ferrimagnets, and antiferromagnets all become paramagnetic when 
heated above a critical temperature. This happens when the thermal energy is sufficient 
to overcome the forces determining the spin directions of the electrons. This tempera-
ture is called the Curie temperature, T
C, for ferromagnets and ferrimagnets and the Néel 
temperature, T
N, for antiferromagnets.
23.2 ∣ Transition-Metal Complexes
The transition metals occur in many interesting and important molecular forms. Species 
that are assemblies of a central transition-metal ion bonded to a group of surrounding 
molecules or ions, such as 3Ag(NH3)24+ and 3Fe(H2O)643+, are called metal complexes, 
or merely complexes.* If the complex carries a net charge, it is generally called a complex 
ion. 
 (Section 17.5) Compounds that contain complexes are known as coordination 
compounds.
