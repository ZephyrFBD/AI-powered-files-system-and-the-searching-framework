In a study of dusky salamanders, Desmognathus ochrophaeus,
scientists brought individuals from two different populations into the
laboratory and tested their ability to mate and produce viable, fertile
offspring. Below is the graph of the data:
The degree of reproductive isolation is represented by an index
ranging from 0 (no isolation) to 2 (complete isolation).
Which of the following statements best describes the
evolutionary history of dusky salamanders?
Mutations alone caused the two populations to diverge.
Both mutations and genetic drift caused the two populations to
diverge.
Both mutations and genetic drift caused the two populations to
become separate species after they were separated by a great
distance.
Reproductive isolation between the two populations increases
as the distance between them increases.

female and a normal body cell from a male. Which of the following
