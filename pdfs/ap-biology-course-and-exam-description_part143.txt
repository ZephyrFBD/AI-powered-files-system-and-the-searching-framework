Mitosis Lab
IST-1.C
Explain how mitosis results 
in the transmission of 
chromosomes from one 
generation to the next.
IST-1.C.1
Mitosis is a process that ensures the transfer 
of a complete genome from a parent cell to two 
genetically identical daughter cells—
a. Mitosis plays a role in growth, tissue repair, 
and asexual reproduction. 
b.  
Mitosis alternates with interphase in the 
cell cycle.
c. Mitosis occurs in a sequential series of steps 
(prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase).
