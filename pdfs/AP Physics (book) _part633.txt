 a block on a frictionless table
(Fig. 6–26). If you choose the block as your system, then the work done on the
block by the spring equals the change in kinetic energy of the block: the work-
energy principle. (Energy conservation does not apply to this system—the block’s
energy changes.) If instead you choose the block plus the spring as your system,
no external forces do work (since the spring is part of the chosen system).
To this system you need to apply conservation of energy: if you compress the spring
and then release it, the spring still exerts a force† on the block, but the subsequent
motion can be discussed in terms of kinetic energy 
plus potential energy
whose total remains constant.
You may also wonder sometimes whether to approach a problem using work
and energy, or instead to use Newton’s laws. As a rough guideline, if the force(s)
involved are constant, either approach may succeed. If the forces are not constant,
and/or the path is not simple, energy may be the better a
