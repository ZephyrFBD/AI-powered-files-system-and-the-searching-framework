the change in volume inside the respirometer to measure only oxygen
consumption.
Submerge the respirometers in water. As oxygen is used up inside the
respirometer, water will flow into the respirometer through the pipette and
will be a measure of oxygen consumption.
The results of the experiment are simply stated. The higher the
temperature, the more oxygen is used and the faster the rate of respiration.
