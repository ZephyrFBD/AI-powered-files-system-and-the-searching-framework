Before starting this laboratory, students should understand how proteins are made 
and establish their final structure. The final structure of the protein (in this investigation, 
an enzyme) is determined by interactions between its amino acids and the surrounding 
environment. Primary structure is the protein’s unique sequence of amino acids. The 
protein chain will contain hundreds to a few thousand amino acids (sometimes more) 
and can be identified with an amino end and a carboxyl end. Secondary structure 
produces ß pleated sheets or α helices formed by hydrogen bonding throughout 
the molecule. Tertiary structure occurs because of the numerous interactions of the 
backbone amino acids with various side chains (R groups), such as hydrophilic or 
hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonds, and disulfide bridges associated with the amino 
acid cysteine. At this point the protein may be active or become a component
