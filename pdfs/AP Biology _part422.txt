The cumulative effect of plate movement over millions of years has
changed the flora and fauna of Earth. About 250 million years ago, plate
movement brought all the previously separated land masses together into
one supercontinent called Pangaea. Ocean basins became deeper, which
lowered sea level and drained shallow waters. A multitude of species went
extinct.
Continental drift has changed the distributions of life on Earth. One
example is the fact that marsupials are located almost exclusively in
Australia, while other continents are home to eutherians, the true placental
mammals. Fossil evidence suggests that marsupials originated in what is
now Asia and reached Australia via South America and Antarctica while
the continents were still joined. When the continents broke apart and
moved to different climates, Australia was set afloat like a giant raft,
carrying both marsupials and eutherians. In Australia the marsupials
