 pH 7.4? 
(b) What is the ratio of HCO3 
- to H2CO3 in an exhausted 
marathon runner whose blood pH is 7.1?
 17.30  A buffer, consisting of H2PO4 
- and HPO4 
2 -, helps control 
the pH of physiological fluids. Many carbonated soft drinks 
also use this buffer system. What is the pH of a soft drink 
in which the major buffer ingredients are 6.5 g of NaH2PO4 
and 8.0 g of Na2HPO4 per 355 mL of solution?
 17.31  You have to prepare a pH = 3.50 buffer, and you have the 
following 0.10 M solutions available: HCOOH, CH3COOH,
H3PO4, HCOONa, CH3COONa, and NaH2PO4. Which solu-
tions would you use? How many milliliters of each solution 
would you use to make approximately 1 L of the buffer?
 17.32  You have to prepare a pH = 5.00 buffer, and you have the 
following 0.10 M solutions available: HCOOH, HCOONa, 
CH3COOH, CH3COONa, HCN, and NaCN. Which solu-
tions would you use? How many milliliters of each solution 
would you use to make approximately 1 L of the buffer?
