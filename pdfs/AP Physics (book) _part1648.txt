e order or disorder of a system.
When we deal with entropy—as with potential energy—it is the change in
entropy during a process that is important, not the absolute amount. According
to Clausius, the change in entropy S of a system, when an amount of heat Q is
added to it by a reversible† process at constant temperature, is given by
(15;8)
where T is the kelvin temperature. (If heat is lost, Q is negative in this equation,
as per our original sign conventions on page 413.)

The Laws of Thermodynamics
†Real processes are irreversible. Because entropy is a state variable, the change in entropy 
for an
irreversible process can be determined by calculating 
for a reversible process between the same
two states.

Entropy change in melting. An ice cube of mass 56 g is
taken from a storage compartment at 0°C and placed in a paper cup. After a few
minutes, exactly half of the mass of the ice cube has melted, becoming water at
0°C. Find the change in entropy of the
