 even larger intervals 
through the remaining measurements. It is typical for rates to decrease as a reaction 
From the data in Figure 14.2, calculate the average rate at which A disappears over the time interval from 20 s to 40 s.
Sample Exercise 14.1
 Calculating an Average Rate of Reaction
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the concentration of A at 20 s 10.54 M2 and 
at 40 s 10.30 M2 and asked to calculate the average rate of reaction 
over this time interval.
Plan The average rate is given by the change in concentration, ∆3A4, 
divided by the change in time, ∆t. Because A is a reactant, a minus 
sign is used in the calculation to make the rate a positive quantity.
Solve
Average rate =  
-  
∆3A4
∆t
= -  0.30 M - 0.54 M
40 s - 20 s
= 1.2 * 10-2 M>s
