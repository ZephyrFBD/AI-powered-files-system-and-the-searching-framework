int a (relative to some
zero potential energy), the electric potential 
at this point is
(17;2a)
As we discussed in Chapter 6, only differences in potential energy are physically
meaningful. Hence only the difference in potential, or the potential difference,
between two points a and b (such as those shown in Fig. 17–1) is measurable.

When the electric force does positive work on a charge, the kinetic energy increases
and the potential energy decreases. The difference in potential e
