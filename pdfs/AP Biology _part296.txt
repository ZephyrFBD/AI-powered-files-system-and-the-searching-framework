A cross was made between two fruit flies: a white-eyed female and a
wild male (red-eyed). One hundred F1 offspring were produced. All
the males were white-eyed and all the females were wild. When
these F1 flies were allowed to mate, the F2 flies were observed and
the following data was collected.
What is the most likely pattern of inheritance for the white-eyed
trait?
