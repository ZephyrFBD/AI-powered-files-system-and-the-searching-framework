 cellulose contains 1-4 glycosidic linkages of beta
glucose monomers, eliminating (D). While most organisms have
enzymes that can hydrolyze the alpha linkages of starch, very few have
enzymes that can hydrolyze the beta linkages of cellulose, eliminating
(A). By process of elimination, (B) is the correct answer. Indeed, due to
the beta linkages in cellulose, the polymer forms a straight line,
making it very eﬀective for structural support. Conversely, the alpha
linkages in starch cause it to form a spiral, making it less optimal for
structural support but perfect for storing a large quantity of glucose in
a limited space. This structure also allows short chains of glucose to
branch oﬀ of the main helix, and, as a result, when plants need energy,
they can quickly break down these smaller branches.
