mRNA procedure
can breach the blood-brain barrier which protects the brain from
toxins and other crap that will cause malfunction. In this case they
could make two proteins corrupt brain function to cause
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) , a progressive nervous system
disease leading to loss of muscle control, and frontal lobe
degeneration – Alzheimer’s and dementia. Immunologist J. Bart
Classon published a paper connecting mRNA ‘vaccines’ to prion
disease which can lead to Alzheimer’s and other forms of
neurogenerative disease while others have pointed out the potential
to aﬀect the placenta in ways that make women infertile. This will
become highly signiﬁcant in the next chapter when I will discuss
other aspects of this non-vaccine that relate to its nanotechnology
and transmission from the injected to the uninjected.

Tenpenny describes how research has conﬁrmed that these ‘vaccine’-
generated antibodies can interact with a range of other tissues in the
body an
