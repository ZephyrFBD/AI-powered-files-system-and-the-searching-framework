, a region about a central 
atom in which an electron pair is concentrated. (Section 9.2)
electron-domain geometry The three-dimensional arrangement 
of the electron domains around an atom according to the VSEPR 
model. (Section 9.2)
electronegativity A measure of the ability of an atom that 
is bonded to another atom to attract electrons to itself. 
(Section 8.4)
electronic charge The negative charge carried by an electron; it 
has a magnitude of 1.602 * 10-19 C. (Section 2.3)
electronic structure The arrangement of electrons in an atom or 
molecule. (Chapter 6: Introduction)
electron-sea model A model for the behavior of electrons in 
metals. (Section 12.4)
electron shell A collection of orbitals that have the same value 
of n. For example, the orbitals with n = 3 (the 3s, 3p, and 3d 
orbitals) comprise the third shell. (Section 6.5)
electron spin A property of the electron that makes it behave as 
though it were a tiny magnet. The electron behaves as if it were 
spinning on its axis
