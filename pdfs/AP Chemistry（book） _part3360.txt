ron-to-proton ratio of 
1.25. Elements with Z 6 20 normally have stable nuclei that 
contain approximately equal numbers of neutrons and pro-
tons 1n/p = 12. Thus, carbon-14 is located above the belt of 
stability, and we expect it to decay by emitting a beta particle 
to decrease the n/p ratio:
14
6C ยก 14
7N +
0
-1e
This is indeed the mode of decay observed for carbon-14, a 
reaction that lowers the n/p ratio from 1.25 to 1.0.
(b) Xenon is element 54. Thus, xenon-118 has 54 protons and 
118 - 54 = 64 neutrons, giving it an n/p ratio of 1.18. 
According to Figure 21.1, stable nuclei in this region of the belt 
of stability have higher neutron-to-proton ratios than  
xenon-118. The nucleus can increase this ratio by either posi-
tron emission or electron capture:
 
118
54Xe ยก 118
53I + 0
+1e
 
118
54Xe +
0
-1e ยก 118
53I
In this case, both modes of decay are observed.
