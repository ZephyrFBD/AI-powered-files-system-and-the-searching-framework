ot because
there is a third (fixed) charge nearby. What must be the
magnitude of the third charge and its placement in order
for the first two to be in equilibrium?

19. (I) Determine the magnitude and direction of the electric
force on an electron in a uniform electric field of strength
that points due east.
20. (I) A proton is released in a uniform electric field, and it
experiences an electric force of 
toward the
south. Find the magnitude and direction of the electric
field.
21. (I) Determine the magnitude and direction of the electric
field 21.7 cm directly above an isolated 
charge.
22. (I) A downward electric force of 6.4 N is exerted on a
charge. Find the magnitude and direction of 
the electric field at the position of this charge.
23. (II) Determine the magnitude of the acceleration experi-
enced by an electron in an electric field of 
How
does the direction of the acceleration depend on the
direction of the field at that point?
