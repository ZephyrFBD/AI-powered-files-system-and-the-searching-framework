get to check out the formula sheet!
This list is a good reference for the types of quantitative questions you should be able to tackle. We will not walk
though all of these in detail, but you will find some examples in the end-of-chapter drills and in the practice tests.
Use the formula sheets to familiarize yourself with these concepts.

SUMMARIZING AND PRESENTING DATA
Instead of presenting raw data, scientists use descriptive statistics and graphs to summarize large datasets, present
patterns in data, and communicate results. Descriptive statistics summarize and show variation in the data. There are
many types of descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency (such as mean, median, and mode) and
