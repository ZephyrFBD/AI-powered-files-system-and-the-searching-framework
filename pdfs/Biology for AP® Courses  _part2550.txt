 Bacteria
contain 70S ribosomes while Archaea contain
80S ribosomes.
c.
Typical cells in Archaea and Bacteria contain a
cell wall, nuclear membranes, nucleoid region
and often a capsule, flagellum, and pili but in
some instances different chemical compounds
make them. Cell walls of Bacteria contain
peptidoglycan while Archaea do not. Plasma
membrane lipids of bacteria are fatty acids,
while the plasma membrane lipids of Archaea
are phytanyl groups.

and bacilli. Describe the basic structural features of each
category.
