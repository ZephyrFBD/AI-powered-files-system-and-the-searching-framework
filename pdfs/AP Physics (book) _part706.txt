FIGURE 7;7 Example 7–5.
Rifle recoil. Calculate the recoil velocity of a 5.0-kg rifle that
shoots a 0.020-kg bullet at a speed of 
Fig. 7–7.
APPROACH Our system is the rifle and the bullet, both at rest initially, just
before the trigger is pulled. The trigger is pulled, an explosion occurs inside the
bullet’s shell, and we look at the rifle and bullet just as the bullet leaves the barrel
(Fig. 7–7b). The bullet moves to the right 
and the gun recoils to the left.
During the very short time interval of the explosion, we can assume the external
forces are small compared to the forces exerted by the exploding gunpowder.
Thus we can apply conservation of momentum, at least approximately.
SOLUTION Let subscript B represent the bullet and R the rifle; the final veloc-
ities are indicated by primes. Then momentum conservation in the x direction
gives
We solve for the unknown 
and find
Since the rifle has a
