uch faster scanners use a fan
beam, Fig. 25–43a, in which beams passing through the entire cross section of the
body are detected simultaneously by many detectors. The source and detectors
are then rotated about the patient, and an image requires only a few seconds.
Even faster, and therefore useful for heart scans, are fixed source machines
wherein an electron beam is directed (by magnetic fields) to tungsten targets
surrounding the patient, creating the X-rays. See Fig. 25–43b.
Image Formation
But how is the image formed? We can think of the slice to be imaged as being
divided into many tiny picture elements (or pixels), which could be squares (as in
Fig. 24–49). For CT, the width of each pixel is chosen according to the width of
the detectors and or the width of the X-ray beams, and this determines the reso-
lution of the image, which might be 1 mm. An X-ray detector measures the
intensity of the transmitted beam. Subtracting this value from the intensity of the
beam at the source y
