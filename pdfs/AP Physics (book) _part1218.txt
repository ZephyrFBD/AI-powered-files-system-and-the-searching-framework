 a row of soldiers. The soldiers are marching
from firm ground (medium 1) into mud (medium 2) and hence are slowed down
after the boundary. The soldiers that reach the mud first are slowed down first,
and the row bends as shown in Fig. 11–44a. Let us consider the wave front (or
row of soldiers) labeled A in Fig. 11–44b. In the same time 
that 
moves a 
distance
we see that 
moves a distance
The two right triangles
in Fig. 11–44b, shaded yellow and green, have the side labeled a in common. Thus
since a is the hypotenuse, and
Dividing these two equations, we obtain the law of refraction:
(11;20)
Since 
is the angle of incidence 
and 
is the angle of refraction 
Eq. 11–20 gives the quantitative relation between the two. If the wave were going
in the opposite direction, the geometry would not change; only 
and 
would
change roles:
would be the angle of incidence and 
the angle of refraction.
Thus, if the wave travels into a medium where it can move faster, it will bend 
the opposite way,
