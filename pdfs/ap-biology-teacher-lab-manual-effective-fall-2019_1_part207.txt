tigation can be accomplished in two class 
periods (i.e., depending on school setting, class periods could be 45, 50, or 60 minutes in 
duration), with at least one additional class period required for model exploration. After 
completing the model exploration, the class should consider exploring applications of 
the null Hardy-Weinberg model in the real world by following up with the supertasters 
lab suggested in the section Where Can Students Go from Here?

■ Safety and Housekeeping 
Typical laboratory safety concerns do not apply to computer modeling. However, there 
are some important things to consider when managing such work in the classroom. To 
avoid frustration, develop a system whereby the students periodically save their work.  
When developing and working out models, it is often a good idea to save each new 
version of the model with a different file name. That way, if a particular strategy doesn’t 
work, a student will not necessarily have to
