 10.41 A 35.1 g sample of solid CO2 (dry ice) is added to a container 
at a temperature of 100 K with a volume of 4.0 L. If the con-
tainer is evacuated (all of the gas removed), sealed and then 
allowed to warm to room temperature 1T = 298 K2 so that all 
of the solid CO2 is converted to a gas, what is the pressure in-
side the container?
 10.42  A 334-mL cylinder for use in chemistry lectures contains 
5.225 g of helium at 23 °C. How many grams of helium must 
be released to reduce the pressure to 75 atm assuming ideal 
gas behavior?
 10.43 Chlorine is widely used to purify municipal water supplies 
and to treat swimming pool waters. Suppose that the volume 
of a particular sample of Cl2 gas is 8.70 L at 895 torr and 24 °C. 
(a) How many grams of Cl2 are in the sample? (b) What 
volume will the Cl2 occupy at STP? (c) At what temperature 
will the volume be 15.00 L if the pressure is 8.76 * 102 torr?  
(d) At what pressure will the volume equal 5.00 L if t
