 light. Compare
this to nonmetallic materials that have a distinct color—the atomic electrons
exist only in certain energy states, and when white light falls on them, the atoms
absorb at certain frequencies, and reflect other frequencies which make up the
color we see.
Here is a brief comparison of important strong bonds:
• ionic: an electron is “grabbed” from one atom by another;
• covalent: electrons are shared by atoms within a single molecule;
• metallic: electrons are shared by all atoms in the metal.
The atoms or molecules of some materials, such as the noble gases, can form
only weak bonds with each other. As we saw in Section 29–3, weak bonds have
very low binding energies and would not be expected to hold atoms together as a
liquid or solid at room temperature. The noble gases condense only at very low
temperatures, where the atomic (thermal) kinetic energy is small and the weak
attraction can then hold the atoms together.
