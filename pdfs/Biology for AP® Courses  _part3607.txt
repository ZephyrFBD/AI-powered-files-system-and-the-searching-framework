c; therefore, when air fills the lungs, the elastic
recoil within the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs. These outward and inward forces
compete to inflate and deflate the lung with every breath. Upon exhalation, the lungs recoil to force the air out of the lungs,
and the intercostal muscles relax, returning the chest wall back to its original position (Figure 30.16b). The diaphragm
also relaxes and moves higher into the thoracic cavity. This increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity relative to
the environment, and air rushes out of the lungs. The movement of air out of the lungs is a passive event. No muscles are
contracting to expel the air.
Each lung is surrounded by an invaginated sac. The layer of tissue that covers the lung and dips into spaces is called the
visceral pleura. A second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax (Figure 30.17). The space between these
layers, the intrapleural space, contains a small amo
