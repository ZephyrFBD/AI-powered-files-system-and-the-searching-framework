aximum of 
when placed between the pole faces of a magnet. The
current flows horizontally to the right and the magnetic
field is vertical. The wire is observed to “jump” toward the
observer when the current is turned on. (a) What type of
magnetic pole is the top pole face? (b) If the pole faces have
a diameter of 10.0 cm, estimate the current in the wire if
the field is 0.220 T. (c) If the wire is tipped so that it makes
an angle of 10.0° with the horizontal, what force will it 
now feel? [Hint: What length of wire will now be in the
field?]
8. (II) Suppose a straight 1.00-mm-diameter copper wire
could just “float” horizontally in air because of the force
due to the Earth’s magnetic field 
which is horizontal,
perpendicular to the wire, and of magnitude 
What current would the wire carry? Does the answer seem
feasible? Explain briefly.
