is 
difficult to make in the lab. One reported synthesis requires 
11 steps, and the final yield of paclitaxel is only 5%. Assum-
ing all steps have equivalent yields, what is the average per-
cent yield for each step in the synthesis?
 3.108 Consider a sample of calcium carbonate in the form of a cube 
measuring 2.005 in. on each edge. If the sample has a density 
of 2.71 g>cm3, how many oxygen atoms does it contain?
 3.109  (a) You are given a cube of silver metal that measures 1.000 
cm on each edge. The density of silver is 10.5 g>cm3. How 
many atoms are in this cube? (b) Because atoms are spher-
ical, they cannot occupy all of the space of the cube. The 
silver atoms pack in the solid in such a way that 74% of the 
volume of the solid is actually filled with the silver atoms. 
Calculate the volume of a single silver atom. (c) Using the 
volume of a silver atom and the formula for the volume of a 
sphere, calculate the radius in angstroms of a silver atom.
