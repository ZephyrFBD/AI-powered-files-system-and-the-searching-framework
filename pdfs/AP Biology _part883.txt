Out of 4 total points possible, this answer would have earned all 4
points. The breakdown of these point distributions is as follows:
The student received a point for correctly stating the following:
This population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Thus,
this population is isolated with no natural selection. (1 point)
The student earned the full 1 point for this response. Thus,
