As shown by the blue arrow, an electron is excited from a nonbonding 
orbital on O into one of the empty d orbitals on Mn.
The oxalate ion has the Lewis structure shown in Table 23.4. (a) Show the geometry of the complex formed when this ion 
complexes with cobalt(II) to form 3Co(C2O4)(H2O)44. (b) Write the formula for the salt formed when three oxalate ions complex 
with Co(II), assuming that the charge-balancing cation is Na+. (c) Sketch all the possible geometric isomers for the cobalt 
complex formed in part (b). Are any of these isomers chiral? Explain. (d) The equilibrium constant for the formation of the
