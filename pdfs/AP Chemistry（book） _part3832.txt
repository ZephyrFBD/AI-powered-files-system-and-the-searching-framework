bond, what class of compound is it?
(a) an eneyne (b) a dieneyne (c) a trieneyne 
(d) an enediyne (e) an enetriyne
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Draw the condensed structural formula for 
4-methyl-2-pentyne.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which compound does not exist?
(a) 1,2,3,4,5,6,7-octaheptaene (b) cis-2-butane
(c) trans-3-hexene (d) 1-propene (e) cis-4-decene
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
How many straight-chain isomers are there of hexene, C6H12?
Because the first C atom in 1-pentene is 
bonded to two H atoms, there are no cis–
trans isomers. There are cis and trans isomers 
for 2-pentene, however. Thus, the three iso-
mers for pentene are:
CH2
H
CH3
CH3

trans-2-Pentene

(You should convince yourself that cis-3-
pentene is identical to cis-2-pentene and that 
trans-3-pentene is identical to trans-2-pentene. 
However, cis-2-pentene and trans-2-pentene 
are the correct names because they have 
smaller numbered prefixes.)
