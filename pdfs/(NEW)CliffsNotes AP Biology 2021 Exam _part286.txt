t upon chemicals in the environment that are produced
by other individuals. This kind of chemical signaling between organisms is often required to elicit mating. For
example, when nutrient availability is scarce, slime bacteria secrete signaling molecules that stimulate nearby
bacteria to aggregate, form a multicellular collective, grow into a fruiting body, and produce spores. Similarly,
certain yeast cells only mate with yeast cells of an opposite mating type. To signal its presence, a yeast cell secretes
a pheromone (a signaling molecule), to which only yeasts of the opposite mating type respond.
Non-Nuclear Inheritance
Mitochondria and chloroplasts carry within their own DNA genes that are responsible for some of their metabolic
processes. In most plants and animals, these organelles assort randomly during cell division and are inherited only
from the mother as the male gamete (pollen or sperm) delivers very little cytoplasm. This maternal inheritance can
be used to trace a specifi
