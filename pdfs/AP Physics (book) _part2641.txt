f the other wave, and so they
add to produce zero amplitude (Fig. 24–8b). This is destructive interference, and
the screen is dark, Fig. 24–7c. Thus, there will be a series of bright and dark lines
(or fringes) on the viewing screen.
To determine exactly where the bright lines fall, first note that Fig. 24–7 is
somewhat exaggerated; in real situations, the distance d between the slits is very
small compared to the distance to the screen. The rays from each slit for each
case will therefore be essentially parallel, and 
is the angle they make with the
horizontal as shown in Fig. 24–7d. From the shaded right triangles shown in
Figs. 24–7b and c, we can see that the extra distance traveled by the lower ray is
(seen more clearly in Fig. 24–7d). Constructive interference will occur, and
a bright fringe will appear on the screen, when the path difference,
equals
a whole number of wavelengths:
(24;2a)
The value of m is called the order of the interference fringe. The first order
for example,
