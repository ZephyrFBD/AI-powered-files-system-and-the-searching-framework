5.0°C. The air temperature
is increased to 31.0°C in one tube. If the two pipes are 
now sounded together, what beat frequency results?
81. Each string on a violin is tuned to a frequency 
times that
of its neighbor. The four equal-length strings are to be
placed under the same tension; what must be the mass per
unit length of each string relative to that of the lowest string?

87. Two open organ pipes, sounding together, produce a beat
frequency of 6.0 Hz. The shorter one is 2.40 m long. How
long is the other?
88. A bat flies toward a moth at speed 
while the moth
is flying toward the bat at speed 
The bat emits a
sound wave of 51.35 kHz. What is the frequency of the wave
detected by the bat after that wave reflects off the moth?
89. A bat emits a series of high-frequency sound pulses as it
approaches a moth. The pulses are approximately 70.0 ms
apart, and each is about 3.0 ms long. How far away can the
moth be detected by the bat so th
