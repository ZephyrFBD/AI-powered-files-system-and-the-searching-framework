in this manner to investigate respiration.
During the Krebs cycle, succinate is oxidized to fumarate as
electrons
 
are transferred to FAD for its reduction to FADH2(see figure above). In
this experiment, DPIP is provided as a substitute electron acceptor for FAD. DPIP, which is blue in its oxidized
state, accepts electrons from succinate. After accepting the electrons, DPIP turns clear, its reduced state. A
spectrophotometer is used to quantify the degree of color change by measuring the amount of light that is
transmitted through a cuvette. A cuvette with a higher transmittance percentage indicates a solution with more
reduced DPIP.
Three cuvettes are prepared at low temperatures with an appropriate buffer. The contents of a fourth cuvette is
similarly prepared except that the mitochondrial suspension is first preheated to 100Â°C and then returned to a low
temperature. Distilled water was added to bring the contents of all cuvettes to the same volume. A summary of the
contents
