AP Biology Lab 3: Comparing DNA
Sequences to Understand
Evolutionary Relationships with
BLAST Investigation
Since 1990, scientists have been working to develop a comprehensive
library of genes from several species, including humans, mice, fruit flies,
and E. coli. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is a powerful
bioinformatics program that helps scientists to compare genes from
diﬀerent organisms cataloged in this library. Information derived from
BLAST can, therefore, show scientists the evolutionary relationships
between diﬀerent organisms.
In this investigation, you will use BLAST to compare several genes from
diﬀerent organisms and then construct a cladogram to represent the
evolutionary relationships among these diﬀerent species. While
cladograms can be constructed using many diﬀerent factors, including
the presence of diﬀerent morphological trai
