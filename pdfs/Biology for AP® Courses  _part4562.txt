he population eventually became
stable after reaching a maximum number of 120
individuals, which could be the carrying
capacity of the local environment.
c.
The plant population grew logistically
throughout the years as the growth rate of the
population slowed down. The population
eventually became stable after reaching a
maximum number of 120 individuals, which
could be the carrying capacity of the
environment.
d.
The population grew exponentially in the first
few years and later became logistic as the rate
slowed down. The population eventually became
stable after reaching a number of 116
individuals, which could be the carrying
capacity of the environment.
