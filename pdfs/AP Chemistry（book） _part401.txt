he same number of C atoms as one molecule of CO2, the 
coefficients for these substances must be the same in the balanced equation. Therefore, 
we start by choosing the coefficient 1 (unwritten) for both CH4 and CO2.
Next we focus on H. On the left side of the equation we have CH4, which has four H 
atoms, whereas on the right side of the equation we have H2O, containing two H atoms. 
To balance the H atoms in the equation we place the coefficient 2 in front of H2O. Now 
there are four H atoms on each side of the equation:
 
CH4 + O2 ¡ CO2 + 2 H2O 1unbalanced2  
[3.3] 
While the equation is now balanced with respect to hydrogen and carbon, it is not yet 
balanced for oxygen. Adding the coefficient 2 in front of O2 balances the equation by 
giving four O atoms on each side 12 * 2 left, 2 + 12 * 12 right2: 
 
CH4 + 2 O2 ¡ CO2 + 2 H2O 1balanced2  
[3.4] 
The molecular view of the balanced equation is shown in Figure 3.5.
