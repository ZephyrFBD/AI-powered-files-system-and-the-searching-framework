the crate?
(a) The force of friction.
(b) The force of gravity.
(c) The normal force.
(d) The force of you pushing.
(e) The net force.
14. A ball is thrown straight up. Neglecting air resistance, which
statement is not true regarding the energy of the ball?
(a) The potential energy decreases while the ball is going
up.
(b) The kinetic energy decreases while the ball is going 
up.
(c) The sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy is
constant.
(d) The potential energy decreases when the ball is 
coming down.
(e) The kinetic energy increases when the ball is coming
down.
11. (II) Recall from Chapter 4, Example 4–14, that you can use
a pulley and ropes to decrease the force needed to raise 
a heavy load (see Fig. 6–37). But for
every meter the load is raised, how much
rope must be pulled up? Account for
this, using energy concepts.
