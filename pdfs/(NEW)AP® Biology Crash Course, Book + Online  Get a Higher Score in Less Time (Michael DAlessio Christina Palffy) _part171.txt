he organisms was measured, then the tanks were kept in the dark for 24 hours. Students in a class
measured the mass of various living organisms. They then kept the organisms in the dark for 24 hours
before remeasuring the mass. No nutrients were in the tank. The data are as follows.
Organism
Starting Mass
Final Mass
Elodea (submerged aquatic plant)
8.5 g
7.5 g
Sea star
20.2 g
19.83
Guppy
32.5 g
29.98 g
8. Which of the following is the best explanation for the pattern of change in mass of the organisms over
time?
(A) Water loss due to evaporation
(B) Catabolism of stored glucose
(C) Photosynthesis occurring
(D) Growth and reproduction of the organisms
9. What is likely to happen to the oxygen level in the water in the tank while it is in the dark?
(A) The oxygen level will go up due to the photosynthesis of the Elodea.
(B) The oxygen level will stay the same, because dissolved oxygen does not diffuse out of water into
organisms.
(C) The oxygen level will go down due to cellular respirat
