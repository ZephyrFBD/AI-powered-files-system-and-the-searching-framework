Positive feedback enhances an already existing process until some
endpoint or maximum rate is reached. An example in the immune system
can be seen in the activity of helper T cells. When a Th cell becomes
activated by a class II MHC molecule, it releases two cytokines:
interleukin-I and interleukin-II. Il-2 stimulates B cells and other T cells
into action. In this example, interleukin-I enhances the activity of the
already activated Th cells, stimulating them more until they are activated
to a maximum. This is in contrast to negative feedback, which is a means
to achieve stability.

Allergies are hypersensitive immune responses to certain
substances called allergens. They involve the release of histamine,
an anti-inflammatory agent, which causes blood vessels to dilate. A
normal allergic reaction involves redness, a runny nose, and itchy
eyes. Antihistamines can normally counteract these symptoms.
However, sometimes an acute allergic response can result i
