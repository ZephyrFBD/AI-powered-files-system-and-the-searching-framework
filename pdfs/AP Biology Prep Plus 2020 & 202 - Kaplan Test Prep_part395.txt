light energy
if the energy is absorbed. Visible color is caused by reflected light. Plants
reflect green light, so green light is not very useful in photosynthesis.
The previous image shows action spectra for the rate of photosynthesis
(dotted line) and the absorbance of chlorophyll a. Note that the two
action spectra do not correlate identically, indicating that the rate of
photosynthesis depends on the presence of other photopigments as well.
Chlorophyll a is medium green, chlorophyll b is yellow-green, and the
carotenoids range in color from yellow to orange. Chlorophyll a is the
only photopigment that participates in light reactions, but chlorophyll b
and the carotenoids indirectly supplement photosynthesis by providing
energy to chlorophyll a. (The carotenoids absorb light the chlorophyll
cannot and transfer the energy to the chlorophyll.) The point to keep in
mind is that many diﬀerent photopigments absorb light energy from
diﬀerent wavelengths during photosynthesis. In order for
