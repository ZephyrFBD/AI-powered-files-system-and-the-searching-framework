, having received their X chromosome from the homozygous dominant
P1 female and their Y chromosome from the P1 male. A subsequent cross between the XWXw female and the XWY male
would produce only red-eyed females (with XWXW or XWXw genotypes) and both red- and white-eyed males (with XWY
or XwY genotypes). Now, consider a cross between a homozygous white-eyed female and a male with red eyes. The F1
generation would exhibit only heterozygous red-eyed females (XWXw) and only white-eyed males (XwY). Half of the F2
females would be red-eyed (XWXw) and half would be white-eyed (XwXw). Similarly, half of the F2 males would be red-
eyed (XWY) and half would be white-eyed (XwY).

male fruit fly and a white-eyed female fruit fly.
