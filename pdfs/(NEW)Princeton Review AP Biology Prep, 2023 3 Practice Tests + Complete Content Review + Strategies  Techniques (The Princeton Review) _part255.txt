the laboratory. During PCR, Taq catalyzes DNA polymerization, similar to how it would in bacteria.
A normal PCR cycle is as follows:
​ 1. Melting/Denaturing
95°C
​ 2. Primer Annealing
50°C
​ 3. Elongation of DNA
(repeat 20–30 cycles)
72°C
Which of the following conditions likely describes the living environment of Taq bacteria?
(A) Freshwater with acidic pH
(B) Hydrothermal vents reaching temperatures between 70–75°C
(C) Hot springs of 40°C
(D) Tide pools with high salinity
8. The biggest difference between an enzyme-catalyzed reaction and an uncatalyzed reaction is that
(A) the free energy between the reactants and the products does not change
(B) the free energy difference between the reactants and the products does not change
(C) the catalyzed reaction would not occur without the enzyme
(D) a different amount of energy is required to reach the transition state of the reaction
9. Two groups of cells were grown under identical conditions. Mitochondria from each group were isolated and
