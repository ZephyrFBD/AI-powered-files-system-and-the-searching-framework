remove a
repressor of transcription or work together with other transcription factors. The increase in mRNA would lead to
increased protein and increased enzyme activity down the road.
Gene B has a decrease in mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity with Protein X. It has increased total activity with
Protein Y. It is likely that Protein X is a repressor of transcription for gene B. It might bind to the promoter of gene B or
to another transcription factor to prevent RNA polymerase binding or prevent transcription from occurring in another
way. Since the enzyme activity increases with Protein Y, but the mRNA and the protein levels did not change, this
means that the enzyme activity was somehow enhanced on the same amount of enzyme that was present without
Protein Y. Protein Y might be an enzyme activator of Enzyme B. It might bind to Enzyme B directly or maybe the protein
phosphorylates it or cleaves it to make the enzyme active.
d) It looks like Enzyme C is unaffected by Protein Y at the m
