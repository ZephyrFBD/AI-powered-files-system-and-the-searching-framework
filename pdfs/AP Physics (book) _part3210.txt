sition in iron 
*39. (II) Use the Bohr model to estimate the wavelength for an
to 
transition in molybdenum 
The
measured value is 0.063 nm. Why do we not expect perfect
agreement?
*40. (II) A mixture of iron and an unknown material is bom-
barded with electrons. The wavelengths of the 
lines are
194 pm for iron and 229 pm for the unknown. What is the
unknown material?
28–11 Lasers
41. (II) A laser used to weld detached retinas puts out 
25-ms-long pulses of 640-nm light which average 0.68-W
output during a pulse. How much energy can be deposited
per pulse and how many photons does each pulse contain?
[Hint: See Example 27–4.]
42. (II) A low-power laser used in a physics lab might have a
power of 0.50 mW and a beam diameter of 3.0 mm. Calcu-
late (a) the average light intensity of the laser beam, and
(b) compare it to the intensity of a lightbulb producing
100-W light viewed from 2.0 m.
43. (II) Calculate the wavelength of the He–Ne laser (see 
Fig. 28–20).
44. (II) Estimate the angula
