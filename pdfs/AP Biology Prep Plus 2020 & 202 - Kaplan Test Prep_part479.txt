 of the mutations occurring in
cancerous cells generates a protein that counteracts the
chromosomal degradation, allowing the cells to continue
dividing.
(D)
12. Many viral infections, such as infections by the human
papillomavirus (HPV), increase the likelihood of the host
developing cancer at the site of infection. Which of the following
best characterizes the mechanism by which such infections give
rise to cancerous growths?
Viruses may produce toxic proteins that attract the immune
system to the virally infected cells, thereby distracting the
immune system from detecting cancerous cells.
(A)
Viruses disrupt the cell’s ability to synthesize its own DNA and
RNA, thereby preventing the cell from growing and
replicating.
(B)
Viruses can increase the rate at which cells grow and divide,
thereby leading to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation.
(C)
Viruses can inhibit appropriate cell growth by consuming the
cell’s nutrients, thereby reducing the cell’s ability to defend
itself from
