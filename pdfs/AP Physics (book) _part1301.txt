FIGURE 12–11 Graphs of the 
three simplest modes of vibration
(standing waves) for a uniform tube
open at both ends (“open tube”).
These simplest modes of vibration
are graphed in (a), on the left, in
terms of the motion of the air 
(displacement), and in (b), on the
right, in terms of air pressure. Each
graph shows the wave format at two
times, A and B, a half period apart.
The actual motion of molecules for
one case, the fundamental, is shown
just below the tube at top left.
†The diameter D of a tube does affect the node at the open end of a tube. The end correction can be
roughly approximated as adding 
to to give us an effective length for the tube in calculations.

For a closed tube, shown in Fig. 12–12a, which could be an organ pipe, there
is always a displacement node at the closed end (because the air is not free to
move) and an antinode at the open end (where the air can move free
