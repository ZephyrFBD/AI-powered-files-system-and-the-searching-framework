s an earlier exposure to antigen A has no
bearing on antibodies against antigen B because adapted immune
reactions are very specific.

STUDY TIP
Recognizing the same antigen during a second exposure to it results in a more rapid and
enhanced immune response than the first exposure does.
 
TYPES OF IMMUNITY
Table 17.1 describes the two types of immunity.

Antibodies are transferred to an individual from someone
else. Examples are maternal antibodies that pass through
the placenta to the developing fetus or through breast milk
to the baby. Also, a person with a weak immune system
often receives an injection of gamma globulin (IgG), which
are antibodies culled from many people, to boost the weak
immune system.
The individual makes his or her own
antibodies after being ill and recovering or
after being given an immunizatio
