monuclear diatomic molecules (those composed of two identi-
cal atoms) of period 2 elements.
Period 2 atoms have valence 2s and 2p orbitals, and we need to consider how they 
interact to form MOs. The following rules summarize some of the guiding principles for 
the formation of MOs and for how they are populated by electrons:
1. The number of MOs formed equals the number of atomic orbitals combined.
2. Atomic orbitals combine most effectively with other atomic orbitals of similar 
energy.
3. The effectiveness with which two atomic orbitals combine is proportional to their 
overlap. That is, as the overlap increases, the energy of the bonding MO is lowered 
and the energy of the antibonding MO is raised.
4. Each MO can accommodate, at most, two electrons, with their spins paired (Pauli 
exclusion principle). 
 (Section 6.7)
5. When MOs of the same energy are populated, one electron enters each orbital (with 
the same spin) before spin pairing occurs (Hundâ€™s rule).
