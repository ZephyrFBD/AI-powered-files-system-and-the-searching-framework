called the R group.

Interactions between R groups of a polypeptide give three-
dimensional structure to the one-dimensional, linear
sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide.
E. Construct an explanation for the effect of R-group
interactions on the properties of a polymer with drawings
showing molecular orientations with stronger and weaker
polar forces between R groups on asparagine and
threonine and between asparagine and alanine.

78. The nucleobase part of deoxyribonucleic acid encodes
information in each component in the sequence making up
the polymer. There are five nucleobases that are
commonly represented by only a single letter: A (adenine),
C (cytosine), G (guanine), T (thymine), and U (uracil).
These molecules form a bond with the 1-carbon of
