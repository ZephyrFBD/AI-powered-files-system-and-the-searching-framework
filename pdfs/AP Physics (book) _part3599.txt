 made up of quarks, according to the Standard Model.
The fundamental particles include the gauge bosons (so-named after the
theory that describes them, gauge theory), which include the gluons, the photon,
and the W and Z particles; these are the particles that mediate (or “carry”) the
strong, electromagnetic, and weak interactions, respectively.
Also fundamental are the leptons, which are particles that do not interact via
the strong force but do interact via the weak nuclear force. Leptons that carry
electric charge also interact via the electromagnetic force. The leptons include
the electron, the muon, and the tau, and three types of neutrino: the electron neu-
trino 
the muon neutrino 
and the tau neutrino 
Each lepton has an
antiparticle. Finally, the recently detected Higgs boson is also considered to be
fundamental, with no internal structure.
The second category of particle in Table 32–2 is the hadrons, which are
composite particles (made up of quarks as we will discuss shortly)
