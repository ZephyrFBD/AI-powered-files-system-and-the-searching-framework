of cytoplasm as it interfaces with the plasma membrane and the
outside environment. This occurs because the central vacuole occupies so much of the cell that the organelles and
cytoplasm are flattened into a narrow area between the central vacuole and the plasma membrane.
The extracellular region is the area outside the plasma membrane. The following may occur in this region:
Cell walls are found in plants, fungi, and many protists (protists are mostly single-celled organisms). Cell walls
develop outside the plasma membrane and provide support for the cell. In plants, the cell wall consists mainly of
cellulose, a polysaccharide made from #x3B2;-glucose. The cell walls of fungi are usually made of chitin. Chitin is
a modified polysaccharide, differing from cellulose in that one of the hydroxyl groups is replaced by a group
containing nitrogen.
The extracellular matrix is found in animals, in the area between adjacent cells. The area is occupied by fibrous
structural proteins, adhesion p
