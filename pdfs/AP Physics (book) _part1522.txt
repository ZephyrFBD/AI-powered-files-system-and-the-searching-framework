APPROACH We apply conservation of energy to our system of tea plus cup,
which we are assuming is isolated: all of the heat that leaves the tea flows into
the cup. We can use the specific heat equation, Eq. 14–2, to determine how the
heat flow is related to the temperature changes.
SOLUTION Because tea is mainly water, we can take its specific heat as
(Table 14–1), and its mass m is its density times its volume
We use Eq. 14–2, apply conservation of energy, and let T be the as yet
unknown final temperature:
Putting in numbers and using Table 14–1 (
for glass), we
solve for T, and find
The tea drops in temperature by 9 C° by coming into equilibrium with the cup.
NOTE The cup increases in temperature by
Its much
greater change in temperature (compared with that of the tea water) is due to
its much smaller specific heat compared to that of water.
NOTE In this calculation, the 
(of Eq. 14–2,
) is a positive quan-
tity on both sides of our conservation of energy equation. O
