because males with the mutant allele have less G6PD
activity, not more. (D) is incorrect because the results indicate that
even homozygous females and hemizygous males display some
amount of G6PD activity, so it is not true that they produce no
functional G6PD.

According to Table 1, even a 1% EMS dose led to a substantial number
of mutations. Table 2 indicates that missense mutations are the most
common. Indeed, it is more likely that missense mutations (which
change the identities of one or more amino acids without otherwise
altering protein structure) would be more likely to produce favorable
results than mutations that altered the structure more dramatically.
(C) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because splicing mutations are
relatively rare, as indicated in Table 2, and because a high dose is not
needed to induce mutations (and too high of a dose could produce too
many mutations, which is more likely to be deleterious to the plant).
(B) is incorrect b
