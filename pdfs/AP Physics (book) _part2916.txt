The concept of time dilation may be hard to accept, for it contradicts our
experience. We can see from Eq. 26–1 that the time dilation effect is indeed negli-
gible unless v is reasonably close to c. If v is much less than c, then the term 
is much smaller than the 1 in the denominator of Eq. 26–1, and then 
(see Example 26–2). The speeds we experience in everyday life are much smaller
than c, so it is little wonder we don’t ordinarily notice time dilation. But experiments
that have tested the time dilation effect have confirmed Einstein’s predictions.
In 1971, for example, extremely precise atomic clocks were flown arou
