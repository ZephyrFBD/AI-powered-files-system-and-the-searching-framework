77. On a 12.0-cm-diameter audio compact disc (CD), digital
bits of information are encoded sequentially along an 
outward spiraling path.
The spiral starts at radius
and winds its way out to radius 
To read the digital information, a CD player rotates the
CD so that the player’s readout laser scans along the
spiral’s sequence of bits at a constant linear speed of
Thus the player must accurately adjust the rota-
tional frequency f of the CD as the laser moves outward.
Determine the values for f (in units of rpm) when the 
laser is located at 
and when it is at R2 .

traveling at a speed
of 
relative to the Earth, hits the Earth at the equa-
tor tangentially, in the direction of Earth’s rotation, and
is embedded there. Use angular momentum to estimate
the percent change in the angular speed of the Earth as a
result of the collision.
