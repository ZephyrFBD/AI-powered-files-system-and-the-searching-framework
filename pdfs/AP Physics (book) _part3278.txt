diffusion of electrons. The “junction” is actually a very thin layer between the
charged n and p semiconductors where all holes are filled with electrons. This
junction region is called the depletion layer (depleted of electrons and holes).†
If a battery is connected to a diode with the positive terminal to the p side
and the negative terminal to the n side as in Fig. 29–29a, the externally applied
voltage opposes the intrinsic potential difference and the diode is said to be
forward biased. If the voltage is great enough, about 0.6 V for Si at room
temperature, it overcomes that intrinsic potential difference and a large current can
flow. The positive holes in the p-type semiconductor are repelled by the positive
terminal of the battery, and the electrons in the n-type are repelled by the nega-
tive terminal of the battery. The holes and electrons meet at the junction, and the
electrons cross over and fill the holes. A current is flowing. The positive terminal
