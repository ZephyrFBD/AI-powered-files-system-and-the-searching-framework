 understand that not all evolution is adaptive. While natural selection selects the fittest individuals
and often results in a more fit population overall, other forces of evolution, including genetic drift and gene flow, often do
the opposite: introducing deleterious alleles to the population’s gene pool. Evolution has no purpose—it is not changing
a population into a preconceived ideal. It is simply the sum of the various forces described in this chapter and how they
influence the genetic and phenotypic variance of a population.
Think About It
In recent years, factories have been cleaner, and less soot is released into the environment. What impact do you think
this has had on the distribution of moth color in the population?
