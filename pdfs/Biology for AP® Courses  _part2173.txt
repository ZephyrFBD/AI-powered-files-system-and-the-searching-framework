either case, this variation in reproductive success generates a strong selection pressure among males to get those matings,
resulting in the evolution of bigger body size and elaborate ornaments to get the females’ attention. Females, on the other
hand, tend to get a handful of selected matings; therefore, they are more likely to select more desirable males.
Sexual dimorphism varies widely among species, of course, and some species are even sex-role reversed. In such cases,
females tend to have a greater variance in their reproductive success than males and are correspondingly selected for the
bigger body size and elaborate traits usually characteristic of males.
