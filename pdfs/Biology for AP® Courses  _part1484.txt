A half century later, British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information
could be transferred from one cell to another “horizontally,” rather than by descent. In 1928, he reported the first
demonstration of bacterial transformation, a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell, thereby changing
morphology and physiology. He was working with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the bacterium that causes pneumonia.
Griffith worked with two strains, rough (R) and smooth (S). The R strain is non-pathogenic (does not cause disease) and
is called rough because its outer surface is a cell wall and lacks a capsule; as a result, the cell surface appears uneven
under the microscope. The S strain is pathogenic (disease-causing) and has a capsule outside its cell wall. As a result, it
has a smooth appearance under the microscope. Griffith injected the live R strain into mice and
