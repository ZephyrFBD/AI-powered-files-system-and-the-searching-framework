Every exponential function f(x) = ax, with a > 0 and a ≠ 1, is a one-to-one function by the 
horizontal line test and therefore, it has an inverse function. 
 
 
The inverse function  is called the logarithmic function with base a and is denoted by log a. 
We know that the inverse function is defined by  
1( )

f

This leads to the following definition of the logarithmic function. 
Let a be a positive number with a ≠ 1. The logarithmic function with base a, denoted by 
log a, is defined by 
log

So log a x is the exponent to which the base a must be raised to give x. 
 
The logarithmic and exponential forms are equivalent equations: If one is true, then so is 
the other.  
So we can switch from one form to the other as in the following illustrations.

We know that if a one-to-one function f has domain A and range B, then its inverse 
function has domain B and range
