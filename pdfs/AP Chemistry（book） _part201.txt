sides of this equation gives 11 in.23 = 12.54 cm23, from which we write the 
desired conversion factor:
12.54 cm23
11 in.23
=
12.5423 cm3
1123 in.3
= 16.39 cm3
1 in.3
Notice that both the numbers and the units are cubed. Also, because 2.54 is an exact 
number, we can retain as many digits of 12.5423 as we need. We have used four, one more 
than the number of digits in the density 119.3 g>cm32. Applying our conversion factors, 
we can now solve the problem:
Mass in grams = 12.00 in.32a16.39 cm3
1 in.3

The procedure is diagrammed here. The final answer is reported to three significant 
 
figures, the same number of significant figures as in 2.00 in.3 and 19.3 g.
