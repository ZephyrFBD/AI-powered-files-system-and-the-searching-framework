rence frame, our Moon revolves on average in 24 h, 50 min,
which means the Moon rises nearly an hour later each day; and it is at its highest
point in the sky about an hour later each day. When the Moon is on the direct oppo-
site side of Earth from the Sun, the Sun’s light fully illuminates the Moon and we
call it a Full moon (Fig. 5–31a). When the Moon is on the same side of the Earth
as the Sun, and nearly aligned with both, we see the Moon as a thin sliver—most
or all of it is in shadow (
a New moon). The phases of the Moon (new, first 
quarter, full, third quarter) take it from one Full moon to the next Full moon in 
29.53 days (
synodic period) on average, as seen from the Earth as reference frame
(Fig.5–31e). In the Sun’s frame of reference, the Moon revolves around the Earth in
27.32 days (sidereal period, Fig. 5–31d). This small difference arises because, when
the Moon has made one complete revolution around the Earth, the Earth itself
has moved in its orbit relative to the Su
