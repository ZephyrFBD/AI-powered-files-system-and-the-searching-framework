ble of aerobic respiration—the process in which organisms convert energy in the presence of oxygen—and glycolysis
is their sole source of ATP. If glycolysis is interrupted, these cells lose their ability to maintain their sodium-potassium
pumps, and eventually, they die.
The last step in glycolysis will not occur if pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of pyruvate, is not
available in sufficient quantities. In this situation, the entire glycolysis pathway will proceed, but only two ATP molecules
will be made in the second half. Thus, pyruvate kinase is a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis.
Think About It
•
Nearly all organisms on Earth carry out some form of glycolysis. How does that fact support or not support the
assertion that glycolysis is one of the oldest metabolic pathways? Justify your answer.
•
Human red blood cells do not perform aerobic respiration, but they do perform glycolysis. What might happen if
glycolysis were blocked in a red blood cell? Could re
