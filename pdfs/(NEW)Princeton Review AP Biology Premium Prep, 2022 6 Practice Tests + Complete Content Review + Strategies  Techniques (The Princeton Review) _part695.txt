on dioxide and water. Photosynthesis
involves light and dark phases. Figure 1 represents two initial steps associated with the light phase.
The light phase supplies the dark phase with NADPH and a high-energy substrate.
A researcher attempted to produce a photosynthetic system outside the living organism according to the
following protocols:
Chloroplasts were extracted from green leaves and ruptured, and their membranes were thereby exposed,
then a solution of hexachloroplatinate ions carrying a charge of –2 was added.
The structure of the composite was analyzed, and the amount of oxygen produced by the system was
measured.
The researcher concluded that the ions were bound to the membrane’s Photosystem 1 site by the attraction of
opposite charges. The resulting composite is shown in Figure 2. It was found that the hexachloroplatinate-
membrane composite was photosynthetically active.
