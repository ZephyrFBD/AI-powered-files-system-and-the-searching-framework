infect bacteria are known as bacteriophages, or phages
for short. They are a diverse group of organisms that are best
characterized by their head and tail structure, which is unique to phages:
The tails are used to latch on to the host cell surface, aȇer which enzymes
digest a portion of the cell membrane to insert viral genetic material
(either DNA or RNA) into the host cell. The capsid and the tails are leȇ

outside of the host cell membrane, diﬀerentiating phage infection from
that of other viruses. Oȇen, the viral DNA or RNA is rapidly destroyed by
powerful bacterial enzymes called restriction enzymes (which are
described in detail in the lab section of chapter 16). These enzymes are a
primitive type of immune system in bacteria and chew up foreign genetic
material.
For the viral genomes that do survive, they will either cause the host cell
to produce new viral particles (as described later in the chapter) or will
integrate into the bacterial chromosome. Phag
