ponents influence the total Ψsystem, by manipulating the individual components (especially Ψs), a plant can control water
movement.
Solute Potential
Solute potential (Ψs), also called osmotic potential, is negative in a plant cell and zero in distilled water. Typical values for
cell cytoplasm are –0.5 to –1.0 MPa. Solutes reduce water potential (resulting in a negative Ψw) by consuming some of the
potential energy available in the water. Solute molecules can dissolve in water because water molecules can bind to them
via hydrogen bonds; a hydrophobic molecule like oil, which cannot bind to water, cannot go into solution. The energy in the
hydrogen bonds between solute molecules and water is no longer available to do work in the system because it is tied up in
the bond. In other words, the amount of available potential energy is reduced when solutes are added to an aqueous system.
Thus, Ψs decreases with increasing solute concentration. Because Ψs is one of the four components of Ψsystem
