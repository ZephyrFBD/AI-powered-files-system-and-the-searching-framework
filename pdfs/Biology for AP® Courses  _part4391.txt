When studying projections of human population growth, ethical questions can also come to light.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the AP速
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP速 exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
