T = temperature in Kelvin (273 + ºC) 

Dilution - used to create a dilute solution from a 
concentrated stock solution 
CiVi = CfVf 
 
i=initial (starting)      C = concentration of solute 
f=final   (desired)       V = volume of solution 
t2 = higher temperature 
t1 = lower temperature 
k2 = metabolic rate at t2 
k1 = metabolic rate at t1 
Q10 = the factor by which the 
reaction rate increases when the 
temperature is raised byten degrees 
 
pH = – log [H+]  
 
Gibbs Free Energy 
G = H – TS 
G = change in Gibbs free energy 
S = change in entropy 
H = change in enthalpy  
T = absolute temperature (in Kelvin)
