em, the H that is bonded to an oxygen in the —COOH group, is ionized in water. 
Thus, the H in the COOH group breaks its O ¬H bond in water. The three other hydrogens 
in acetic acid are bound to carbon and do not break their C ¬H bonds in water. The rea-
sons for this difference are very interesting and will be discussed in Chapter 16.

How many H+(aq) can be generated by each citric acid molecule dissolved in water?
Bases
Bases are substances that accept (react with) H+ ions. Bases produce hydroxide ions 
1OH-2 when they dissolve in water. Ionic hydroxide compounds, such as NaOH, KOH, 
and Ca1OH22, are among the most common bases. When dissolved in water, they disso-
ciate into ions, introducing OH- ions into the solution.
Compounds that do not contain OH- ions can also be bases. For example, ammonia 
1NH32 is a common base. When added to water, it ac
