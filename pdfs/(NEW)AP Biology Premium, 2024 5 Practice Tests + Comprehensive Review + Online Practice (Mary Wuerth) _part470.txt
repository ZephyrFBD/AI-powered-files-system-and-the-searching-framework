enotype (aa)—note that
this equation is used to describe genotype frequencies.
It is useful to review some laws of probability here. If you flip one coin, the probability of getting heads is 
. If you flip two coins at the same time,
the probability of both coins coming up heads is the product of their individual probabilities: 
. Similarly, if p is the probability of
inheriting one copy of the dominant allele (A), then the probability of inheriting two copies of the dominant allele is p × p = p2.
The probability of inheriting two copies of the recessive allele (a) is q × q = q2. The probability of inheriting one dominant allele and one recessive
allele is p × q = pq. However, there are two ways to create a heterozygous individual. The dominant allele could come from the father and the
recessive from the mother, or the dominant allele could come from the mother and the recessive from the father. If there is more than one way that an
event can occur, the probability of the event is the
