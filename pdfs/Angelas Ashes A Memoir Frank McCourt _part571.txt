 to look at Malachy but throws the ball to me. It comes to me as 
 
 if it’s the only thing that exists in the whole world. It comes straight to 
 
 my foot and all I have to do is swivel to the left and swing that ball 
 
 straight into the goal.There’s a whiteness in my head and I feel like a 
 
  
  
 boy in heaven. I’m floating over the whole field till The Red Hearts of 
 
 Limerick clap me on the back and tell me that was a great goal, Frankie, 
 
 you too, Billy.

 We walk back along O’Connell Avenue and I keep thinking of the 
 
 way the ball came to my foot and surely it was sent by God or the Blessed 
 
 Virgin Mary who would never send such a blessing to one doomed for 
 
 being born in half the time and I know as long as I live I’ll never forget 
 
 that ball coming from Billy Campbell, that goal.
