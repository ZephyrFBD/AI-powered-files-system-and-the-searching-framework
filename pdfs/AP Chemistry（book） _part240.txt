 1.69 Two students determine the percentage of lead in a sample 
as a laboratory exercise. The true percentage is 22.52%. The 
studentsâ€™ results for three determinations are as follows:
(1) 22.52, 22.48, 22.54
(2) 22.64, 22.58, 22.62
(a) Calculate the average percentage for each set of data and 
state which set is the more accurate based on the average.  
(b) Precision can be judged by examining the average of the 
deviations from the average value for that data set. (Calcu-
late the average value for each data set; then calculate the av-
erage value of the absolute deviations of each measurement 
from the average.) Which set is more precise?
 1.70  Is the use of significant figures in each of the following state-
ments appropriate? (a) The 2005 circulation of National Geo-
graphic was 7,812,564. (b) On July 1, 2005, the population 
of Cook County, Illinois, was 5,303,683. (c) In the United
