■
• ENE-2: Cells have membranes that allow them to establish and maintain internal 
environments that are different from their external environments.
• ENE-1: The highly complex organization of living systems requires constant input of 
energy and the exchange of macromolecules.
 Learning Objectives
■
• ENE-2.H: Explain how concentration gradients affect the movement of molecules 
across membranes.
• ENE-1.B: Explain the effect of surface area-to-volume ratios on the exchange of 
materials between cells or organisms and the environment.
• ENE-1.C: Explain how specialized structures and strategies are used for the efficient 
exchange of molecules to the environment.
