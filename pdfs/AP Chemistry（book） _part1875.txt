composition 
are shown in Figure 12.18. Gold alloyed with equal parts 
silver and copper (blue dot) takes on the golden 
yellow color we associate with 18-karat gold jew-
elry. Red (14-karat) or rose gold is a copper-rich al-
loy (red dot). Silver-rich alloys take on a greenish 
hue, eventually giving way to silvery-white colors 
as silver becomes the majority constituent.

12.4 ∣ Metallic Bonding
Consider the elements of the third period of the periodic table (Na–Ar). Argon with 
eight valence electrons has a complete octet; as a result it does not form any bonds. 
Chlorine, sulfur, and phosphorus form molecules 1Cl2, S8, and P42 in which the atoms 
make one, two, and three bonds, respectively (Figure 12.19). Silicon forms an extended 
network solid in which each atom is bonded to four equidistant neighbors. Each of 
these elements
