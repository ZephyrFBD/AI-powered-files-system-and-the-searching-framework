at 0°C to melt when it is placed in a carefully sealed 
Styrofoam ice chest of dimensions
whose walls are 1.5 cm thick? Assume that the conductivity
of Styrofoam is double that of air and that the outside 
temperature is 34°C.

48. To get an idea of how much thermal energy is contained in
the world’s oceans, estimate the heat liberated when a cube
of ocean water, 1 km on each side, is cooled by 1 K. (Approx-
imate the ocean water as pure water for this estimate.)
