 of the information in this chapter is not in scope for AP®. However, the chapter is filled with examples that are
applicable to concepts we have previously explored. The circulatory system links to all other organ systems. For example,
nutrients pass from the digestive system into the blood, and the excretory system rids the blood of wastes. In addition,
because heart disease is a leading cause of death in humans, the information is relevant.
Circulatory systems in animals show a distinct pattern of evolution—from none in sponges and jellyfish to open circulatory
systems characteristic of insects to closed circulatory systems with hearts, valves, and vessels in vertebrates. Circulatory
systems provide body cells with oxygen and nutrients, remove wastes, transports hormones, protect against invaders, and
aids in temperature regulation. Although some animals such as the sponge have had no adaptive need to develop a complex
circulatory system (they exchange nutrients and wastes directly
