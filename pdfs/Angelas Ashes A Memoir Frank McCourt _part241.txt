is in a Greek 
 
 story. 
 
 Nora Molloy knows my mother from the queues at the St.Vincent 
 
 de Paul Society. She tells Mam that Mikey has more sense than twelve 
 
 men drinking pints in a pub.He knows the names of all the Popes from 
 
 St.Peter to Pius the Eleventh.He’s only eleven but he’s a man, oh, a man 
 
 indeed. Many a week he saves the family from pure starvation. He borrows 
 
  
  
 a handcart from Aidan Farrell and knocks on doors all over Limerick 
 
 to see if there are people who want coal or turf delivered, and 
 
 down the Dock Road he’ll go to haul back great bags a hundredweight 
 
 or more. He’ll run messages for old people who can’t walk and if they 
 
 don’t have a penny to give him a prayer will do. 
 
 If he earns a little money he hands it over to his mother, who loves 
 
 her Mikey. He is her world, her heart’s blood, her pulse, and if anything 
 
 ever happened to him they might as well stick her in the lunatic asylum 
 
 and throw away the key.
