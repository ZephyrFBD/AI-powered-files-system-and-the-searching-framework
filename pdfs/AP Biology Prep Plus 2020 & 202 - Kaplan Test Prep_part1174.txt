then infer that phosphorylation would most likely
be located at site 3 in the ATP-binding domain, which would aﬀect the
enzymatic rate given that the enzyme is ATP-dependent, and at site 1 in
the DNA-binding domain, which would impact DNA binding. This matches
(C) and eliminates (A) and (B). Phosphorylation does not aﬀect substrate
binding, meaning site 4 is probably not a place of phosphorylation, ruling
out (D).

(a) Describe the relationship between plants and mycorrhizae. (2 points)
Description (2 points)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Plants live in symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi. Since both organisms benefit,
their relationship is mutualistic. The fungi that colonize the root of the plant
provide the plant with increased water and nutrient absorption, protecting
the plant from abiotic (drought) and biotic (pathogen) stresses. The plant, in
turn, provides the fungus
