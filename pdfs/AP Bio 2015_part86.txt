51. Trypsinogen is split by the enzyme enterokinase
to form an activated molecule of the protease
trypsin. Which of the following would confirm
that the activation of trypsin is an example of how
a positive feedback mechanism can amplify a
biological process?
(A) The activated trypsin enzyme can use  
enterokinase as a substrate.  
 
(B) The trypsin produced by the reaction is 
capable of splitting and activating additional 
trypsinogen molecules. 
(C) If levels of trypsin were to get too high, 
 the 
trypsin molecu
