Question 3: Scientific Investigation 
4 points 
Sand lances of the genus Ammodytes are small fish that function as keystone organisms in several coastal 
ecosystems. These sand lances are prey fish that support organisms at higher trophic levels. Scientists 
performed experiments to examine how sand lance populations are likely to be affected by the rising 
temperatures and 
2
CO  levels associated with climate change. 
Sand lance embryos typically develop and mature into adult fish at low temperatures (approximately 5°C) 
and stable, low 
2
CO  levels (approximately 400 μatm). Over the course of two years, the scientists measured 
the survival rate of sand lance embryos allowed to develop and mature in a laboratory at three different 
temperatures, 5°C, 7°C, and 10°C, with the level of
