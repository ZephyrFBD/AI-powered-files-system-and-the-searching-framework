Introduction
Before beginning your review, it is important to understand the guiding principles and units that make up the AP
Biology course and exam. The AP Biology curriculum focuses on four Big Ideas:
Big Idea 1: Evolution—The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life.
Big Idea 2: Energetics—Biological systems use energy and molecular building blocks to grow, reproduce, and
maintain dynamic homeostasis.
Big Idea 3: Information Storage and Transmission—Living systems store, retrieve, transmit, and respond to
information essential to life processes.
