(3)Wasting water:
The time of the process of the loop decreases, but in order to ensure the time of
having a bath, the times of adding water may increase. Thus, the quantities of the
wasting water correspondingly increase.
(4)Conclusion:
The motion of the people will have some impacts on the strategies before.
Modification is to increase the speed of adding water and stir the water
continuously during the process of adding water to enable the water to be even much
more quickly and add the times of adding water moderately.
5.7 The person uses a bubble bath additive
(1)Even time:
The thermal conductivity of the water is 0.599
/ (
)
w
m K

, while the thermal
conductivity of the bubble is 0.025
/ (
)
w
m K

. As a result, the appearance of the
bubble will influence the thermal conductivity of the water so that the thermal process
of the water will be disturbed, resulting in the decrease of its moving efficiency and
the increase of its fusion time. Above all, even time will increase.
