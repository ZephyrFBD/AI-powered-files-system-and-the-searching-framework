g mental disorders plague approximately 12.5 million Americans (about 1 in 17
people) at an annual cost of more than $300 billion. There are several types of mental disorders including schizophrenia,
major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders and phobias, post-traumatic stress disorders, and obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD), among others. The American Psychiatric Association publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (or DSM), which describes the symptoms required for a patient to be diagnosed with a particular
mental disorder. Each newly released version of the DSM contains different symptoms and classifications as scientists learn
more about these disorders, their causes, and how they relate to each other. A more detailed discussion of two mental
illnesses—schizophrenia and major depression—is given below.
