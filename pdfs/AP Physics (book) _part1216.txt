e nodes, no energy flows past these
points. Hence the energy is not transmitted down the string but “stands” in place
in the string.
Standing waves are produced not only on strings, but also on any object that is
struck, such as a drum membrane or an object made of metal or wood. The resonant
frequencies depend on the dimensions of the object, just as for a string they depend
on its length. Large objects have lower resonant frequencies than small objects.

All musical instruments, from stringed to wind instruments (in which a column of air
oscillates as a standing wave) to drums and other percussion instruments, depend on
standing waves to produce their particular musical sounds, as we shall see in Chapter 12.
