of methylene
blue is reduced by NADH, and its reduced form is
oxidized by O2. Explain the use of methylene blue as an
antidote for rotenone poisoning.
57. E. coli are enteric (gut-dwelling) facultative anaerobic
bacteria. (Facultative anaerobes can grow either with or
without free oxygen. Obligatory anaerobes grow only in
the absence of free oxygen.) Researchers planned to grow
cultures of E. coli under a range of conditions to model the
transition from strictly anaerobic to aerobic respiration.
The oxygen content of atmospheres at constant total
pressure will be controlled by volumes of nitrogen and
oxygen gases. Ratios of volume, r = VO2/VN2 between 0
and 0.25 of shaken growth flasks can be measured in terms
of optical density, which is the percent of transmission of
light through a sample of the growing E. coli culture. A
rule of thumb is that the range of strict anaerobes is when r
< 0.01, and the boundary for aerobic respiration is when r
= 0.05. A large number of flasks that can
