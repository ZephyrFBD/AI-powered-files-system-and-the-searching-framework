â– BACKGROUND
Evolution occurs in populations of organisms and involves variation in the population, 
heredity, and differential survival. One way to study evolution is to study how the 
frequency of alleles in a population changes from generation to generation. In other 
words, you can ask What are the inheritance patterns of alleles, not just from two parental 
organisms, but also in a population? You can then explore how allele frequencies change 
in populations and how these changes might predict what will happen to a population in 
the future.
Mathematical models and computer simulations are tools used to explore the 
complexity of biological systems that might otherwise be difficult or impossible to 
study. Several models can be applied to questions about evolution. In this investigation, 
you will build a spreadsheet that models how a hypothetical gene pool cha
