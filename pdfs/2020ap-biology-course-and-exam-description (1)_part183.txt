Protein—A Historical 
Perspective
IST-2.B
Explain how the location of 
regulatory sequences relates 
to their function.
IST-2.B.1
Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have groups 
of genes that are coordinately regulated—
a.	In prokaryotes, groups of genes called 
operons are transcribed in a single mRNA 
molecule. The lac operon is an example of an 
inducible system. 
b.	In eukaryotes, groups of genes may be 
influenced by the same transcription factors 
to coordinately regulate expression.
