81. Calculate the minimum thickness needed for an antireflective
coating 
applied to a glass lens in order to elim-
inate (a) blue (450 nm), or (b) red (720 nm) reflections for
light at normal incidence.
82. Stealth aircraft are designed to not reflect radar, whose
wavelength is typically 2 cm, by using an antireflecting
coating. Ignoring any change in wavelength in the coating,
estimate its thickness.
83. A laser beam passes through a slit of width 1.0 cm and is
pointed at the Moon, which is approximately 380,000 km
from the Earth. Assume the laser emits waves of wave-
length 633 nm (the red light of a He–Ne laser). Estimate
the width of the beam when it reaches the Moon due to
diffraction.
