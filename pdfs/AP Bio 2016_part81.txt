of whether the birds are primarily terrestrial or aquatic species. 
(D) The similar regulation of extracellular fluid volume and composition in all the organisms suggests 
conservation of kidney structure throughout evolution.

Figure 1. Model of synapse 
Researchers investigating the regulation of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic neurons proposed a model 
(Figure 1) in which CDK5, a protein expressed in axon terminals, inhibits the movement of synaptic vesicles to the 
presynaptic membrane. 
To test their model, the researchers used a modified version of green fluorescent protein (GFP*). In slightly 
alkaline conditions, GFP* exhibits a bright green fluorescence. In acidic conditions, GFP* exhibits no fluorescence. 
Using standard techniques, the gene encoding GFP* is easily int
