n ψ = –5.42
bars + 0.48 bars = –4.94 bars. Choice (A) is incorrect because it is the value of ψs alone and doesn’t take into
account the effect of ψp on the total water potential. Choice (C) is incorrect because it is the value of ψp alone
and doesn’t take into account the effect of ψs on the total water potential. Choice (D) is incorrect because the
total water potential is negative in this case, not positive.
4. (D) Water flows from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water potential. Distilled water has a
water potential of 0 bars. If the blood cell has a water potential of –7.7 bars, water will flow from the distilled
water, which has a higher water potential, into the blood cell, which has a lower water potential. Choices (A)
and (C) are incorrect because water will not flow out of the blood cell. Choice (B) is incorrect because even
though that choice correctly states that water will flow into the blood cell, it incorrectly states that the blood cell
has a higher wa
