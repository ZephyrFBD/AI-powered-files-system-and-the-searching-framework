 enzyme rubisco catalyzes the
merging of CO2 and RuBP. The
 
Calvin cycle is referred to as C3 photosynthesis because the first product formed, PGA, contains three carbon
atoms.
2. Reduction: 12 ATP and 12 NADPH are used to convert 12 PGA to 12 G3P. The energy in the ATP and
NADPH molecules is incorporated into G3P, thus making G3P a very energy-rich molecule. ADP, Pi, and
NADP+ are released and then re-energized in noncyclic
 
photophosphorylation.
 
3. Regeneration: 6 ATP are used to convert 10 G3P to 6 RuBP.
 
Regenerating the 6 RuBP originally used to combine with 6 CO2 allows
 
the cycle to repeat.
4. Carbohydrate synthesis. Note that 12 G3P were created in step 2, but only 10 were used in step 3. What
happened to the remaining two? These two remaining G3P are used to build glucose. Other monosaccharides, like
fructose and maltose, can also be formed. In addition, glucose molecules can be combined to form disaccharides,
like sucrose, and polysaccharides, like starch and cellulose.
