 19.85  (a) Which of the thermodynamic quantities T, E, q, w, and 
S are state functions? (b) Which depend on the path taken 
from one state to another? (c) How many reversible paths 
are there between two states of a system? (d) For a reversible 
isothermal process, write an expression for ∆E in terms of q 
and w and an expression for ∆S in terms of q and T.
 19.86  The crystalline hydrate Cd1NO322#4H2O1s2  loses water 
when placed in a large, closed, dry vessel at room 
temperature:
Cd1NO322#4H2O1s2 ¡ Cd1NO3221s2 + 4 H2O1g2
This process is spontaneous and ∆H° is positive at room tem-
perature. (a) What is the sign of ∆S° at room temperature? 
(b) If the hydrated compound is placed in a large, closed ves-
sel that already contains a large amount of water vapor, does 
∆S° change for this reaction at room temperature?
