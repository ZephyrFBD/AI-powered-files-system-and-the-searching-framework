f survival of female elk is greater
when they have accumulated 15% or more body fat by the
end of fall. Female elk with body fat less than 10% in late
fall were found to be at high risk of not surviving the
winter. Explain why this pattern is likely to be observed.

a.
In winter, the availability of food decreases. So,
there needs to be a certain threshold level of
energy their bodies store in the form of fat to
ensure their survival.
b.
In winter, the availability of food increases. So,
there should be a certain threshold level of
energy in their bodies stored in the form of fat to
ensure their survival.
c.
In winter, elkâ€™s requirement for food increases
due to increase in metabolic activities. So, there
should be a certain threshold level of energy in
their bodies stored in the form of fat to ensure
their survival.
d.
Elk release more energy in winter. So, there
should be a certain threshold level of energy in
their bodies store
