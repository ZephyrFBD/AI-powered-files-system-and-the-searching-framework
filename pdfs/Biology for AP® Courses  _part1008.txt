vels through the organism to reach the target cell. Not all cells are
affected by the same signals.

Figure 9.2 In chemical signaling, a cell may target itself (autocrine signaling), a cell connected by gap junctions,
a nearby cell (paracrine signaling), or a distant cell (endocrine signaling). Paracrine signaling acts on nearby cells,
endocrine signaling uses the circulatory system to transport ligands, and autocrine signaling acts on the signaling cell.
Signaling via gap junctions involves signaling molecules moving directly between adjacent cells.
Paracrine Signaling
Signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals. Paracrine signals move by
diffusion through the extracellular matrix. These types of signals usually elicit quick responses that last only a short amount
of time. In order to keep the response localized, paracrine ligand molecules are normally quickly degraded by enzymes
or removed by neighborin
