A) is incorrect because R-groups
are found in amino acids, not RNA. (C) is incorrect because a frameshiȇ mutation is not a
missense mutation, which is a point mutation involving base substitution. (D) is incorrect
because the frameshiȇ mutation aﬀects both RNA and amino acid sequences.
45. B
In competitive inhibition, inhibitor molecules compete with substrates to occupy the
active site of an enzyme. Increasing the concentration of substrate will increase the
likelihood that substrate molecules, rather than inhibitor molecules, will bind to the
enzyme’s active site. (B) is therefore correct. All of the other choices would reduce the
eﬀectiveness of an enzyme, which is what a competitive inhibitor does.
46. D
Deep-diving animals are least likely to be buoyant, to possess a tendency to float on
water, since they depend on being able to stay underwater. (D) is thus correct. (B) is
incorrect because myoglobin stores oxygen in the muscle. Deep divers tend to have high
concentrations of this
