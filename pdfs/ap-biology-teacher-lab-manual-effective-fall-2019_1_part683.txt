methods to calculate leaf surface 
area and then determine the average number of stomata per square millimeter in 
a particular kind of plant. From their data, several questions about the process of 
transpiration in plants should emerge. Students can explore these questions in their own 
investigations.

PREPARATION  
Materials and Equipment 
â€¢  Representative plant species that are available in a particular region or season, such 
as Impatiens (a moisture-loving plant), Coleus, oleander (more drought tolerant), 
Phaseolus vulgaris (bean seedlings), pea plants, varieties of Lycopersicon (tomato), 
peppers, ferns, or even Wisconsin Fast Plants (If students plan to investigate 
transpiration in several different species of plants, you will have to purchase a variety 
of plants, or students can use cuttings from plants found on campus. Note that the 
plants can be used to study other biological concepts, such a
