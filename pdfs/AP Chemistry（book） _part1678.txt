ture and pressure, l is inversely proportional to the square 
of the diameter of the gas molecules. Put these facts to-
gether to create a formula for the mean free path of a gas 
molecule with a proportionality constant (call it Rmfp, like 
the ideal-gas constant) and define units for Rmfp.

Hydrogen has two naturally occurring isotopes, 1H and 2H. 
Chlorine also has two naturally occurring isotopes, 35Cl and 
37Cl. Thus, hydrogen chloride gas consists of four distinct 
types of molecules: 1H35Cl, 1H37Cl, 2H35Cl, and 2H37Cl.  
Place these four molecules in order of increasing rate of 
effusion.

As discussed in the “Chemistry Put to Work” box in Sec- 
tion 10.8, enriched uranium can be produced by effusion of 
gaseous UF6 across a porous membrane. Suppose a process 
were developed to allow effusion of gaseous uranium atoms, 
U(g). Calculate the ratio of effusion rates for 235U and 238U, 
and compare it to the ratio for UF6 given in the essay.
