hy actual isolation isn’t done:
1. There were not enough virus particles found in samples from patients to analyze.
2. Viruses are intracellular parasites; they can’t be found outside the cell in this manner.
If No. 1 is correct, and we can’t ﬁnd the virus in the sputum of sick
people, then on what evidence do we think the virus is dangerous or
even lethal? If No. 2 is correct, then how is the virus spread from
person to person? We are told it emerges from the cell to infect
others. Then why isn’t it possible to ﬁnd it?
Finally, questioning these virology techniques and conclusions is
not some distraction or divisive issue. Shining the light on this truth
is essential to stop this terrible fraud that humanity is confronting.
For, as we now know, if the virus has never been isolated, sequenced
or shown to cause illness, if the virus is imaginary, then why are we
wearing masks, social distancing and puĴing the whole world into
prison?
Finally, if pathogenic viruses don’t exist, then what
