The rat has a mass of 385 g and is exposed to the radiation 
for 14.0 s, absorbing 35% of the emitted alpha particles, 
each having an energy of 9.12 * 10-13 J. Calculate the 
absorbed dose in millirads and grays. (c) If the RBE of the 
radiation is 9.5, calculate the effective absorbed dose in 
mrem and Sv.
 21.70  A 65-kg person is accidentally exposed for 240 s to a 
15-mCi source of beta radiation coming from a sample 
of 90Sr. (a) What is the activity of the radiation source in 
disintegrations per second? In becquerels? (b) Each beta 
particle has an energy of 8.75 * 10-14 J. and 7.5% of the 
radiation is absorbed by the person. Assuming that the 
absorbed radiation is spread over the personâ€™s entire body, 
calculate the absorbed dose in rads and in grays. (c) If the 
RBE of the beta particles is 1.0, what is the effective dose 
in mrem and in sieverts? (d) Is the radiation dose equal to, 
greater than, or less than that for a typical mammogram 
(300 mrem)?
