24.2 ∣ Introduction to Hydrocarbons
Because carbon compounds are so numerous, it is convenient to organize them into 
families that have structural similarities. The simplest class of organic compounds is the 
hydrocarbons, compounds composed of only carbon and hydrogen. The key structural 
feature of hydrocarbons (and of most other organic substances) is the presence of stable 
carbon–carbon bonds. Carbon is the only element capable of forming stable, extended 
chains of atoms bonded through single, double, or triple bonds.
Hydrocarbons can be divided into four types, depending on the kinds of carbon– 
carbon bonds in their molecules.
t Alkanes contain only single C ¬C bonds.
t Alkenes, also known as oleﬁns
