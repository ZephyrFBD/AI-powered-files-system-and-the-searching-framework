theoretical
alleles of our model population. Let’s say that 5 percent of the population
is homozygous recessive. This means that the frequency of the recessive
allele can be determined by letting q2 = 0.05, which means the frequency
of the dominant allele can be determined with the equation:
There is no genetic driȇ. All genotypes code for phenotypes
that have an equal chance of viability and reproduction. There
is no selection of phenotypes.
5.
p = 1 − q = 1 − 0.22 = 0.78
The frequencies of the homozygous dominant genotype and the
heterozygous genotype, respectively, are:
p2 = 0.78 × 0.78 = 0.61
2pq = 2 × 0.78 × 0.22 = 0.34
You can check your work by adding all the genotypic frequencies and
making sure that they total 1:
0.05 + 0.61 + 0.34 = 1
Aȇer developing your Hardy-Weinberg model and exploring how random
events can aﬀect allele frequencies over generations, you will identify
and then test diﬀerent factors that aﬀect the evolution of allele
frequencies. In addition to measuring al
