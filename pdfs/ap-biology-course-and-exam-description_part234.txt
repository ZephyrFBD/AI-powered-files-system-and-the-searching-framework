TIVE
SYI-1.H
Explain how the density 
of a population affects 
and is determined by 
resource availability in 
the environment.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SYI-1.H.1
RELEVANT EQUATION
A population can produce a density of 
individuals that exceeds the system’s resource 
availability.
SYI-1.H.2 
As limits to growth due to density-dependent 
and density-independent factors are imposed, a 
logistic growth model generally ensues.(d N)/ (d x) = r_max N (K minus N/K)
where:
dt = change in time
N = population size
r_max = m
aximum per capita growth rate o
f population
K = carrying capacity
