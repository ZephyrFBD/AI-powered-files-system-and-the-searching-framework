nnot create an electron alone since electric charge would not then be
conserved. The inverse of pair production also occurs: if a positron comes close to
an electron, the two quickly annihilate each other and their energy, including
their mass, appears as electromagnetic energy of photons. Because positrons are
not as plentiful in nature as electrons, they usually do not last long.
Electron–positron annihilation is the basis for the type of medical imaging
known as PET, as discussed in Section 31–8.
Pair production. (a) What is the minimum energy of a
photon that can produce an electron–positron pair? (b) What is this photon’s
wavelength?
APPROACH The minimum photon energy E equals the rest energy 
of
the two particles created, via Einstein’s famous equation 
(Eq. 26–7).
There is no energy left over, so the particles produced will have zero kinetic
energy. The wavelength is 
where 
for the original photon.
SOLUTION (a) Because 
and the mass created is equal to two electron
masses, the
