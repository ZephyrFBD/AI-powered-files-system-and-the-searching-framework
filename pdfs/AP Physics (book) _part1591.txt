ly faces
the Sun on a clear day. The leaf has an emissivity of 0.85 and
a specific heat of 
(a) Estimate the energy
absorbed per second by the leaf from the Sun, and then 
(b) estimate the rate of rise of the leaf’s temperature. (c) Will
the temperature rise continue for hours? Why or why not?
(d) Calculate the temperature the leaf would reach if it lost
all its heat by radiation to the surroundings at 24°C. (e) In
what other ways can the heat be dissipated by the leaf?
66. Using the result of part (a) in Problem 65, take into account
radiation from the leaf to calculate how much water must
be transpired (evaporated) by the leaf per hour to maintain
a temperature of 35°C.
67. After a hot shower and dishwashing, there seems to be no
hot water left in the 65-gal (245-L) water heater. This suggests
that the tank has emptied and refilled with water at roughly
10°C. (a) How much energy does it take to reheat the water
to 45°C? (b) How long would it take if the heater output 
is 9500 W?
