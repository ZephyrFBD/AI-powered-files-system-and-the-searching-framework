rd ionization energy, Ca or S?
Three elements are indicated in the periodic table in the margin. 
Which one has the largest  
second ionization energy?
Sample Exercise 7.5 
Trends in Ionization Energy
SOLUTION
Analyze and Plan The locations of the elements in the periodic 
table allow us to predict the electron configurations. The greatest 
ionization energies involve removal of core electrons. Thus, we 
should look first for an element with only one electron in the out-
ermost occupied shell.
Solve The red box represents Na, which has one valence elec-
tron. The second ionization energy of this element is associ-
ated, therefore, with the removal of a core electron. The other 
elements indicated, S (green) and Ca (blue), have two or more 
valence electrons. Thus, Na should have the largest second ion-
ization energy.
Check A chemistry handbook gives these I2 values: 
Ca, 1145 kJ>mol; S, 2252 kJ>mol; Na,  4562 kJ>mol.
