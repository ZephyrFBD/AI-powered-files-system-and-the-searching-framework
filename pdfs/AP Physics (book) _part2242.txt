Mass spectrometry. Carbon atoms of atomic mass 12.0 u
are found to be mixed with an unknown element. In a mass spectrometer with
fixed 
the carbon traverses a path of radius 22.4 cm and the unknown’s path has
a 26.2-cm radius. What is the unknown element? Assume the ions of both elements
have the same charge.
APPROACH The carbon and unknown atoms pass through the same electric
and magnetic fields. Hence their masses are proportional to the radius of their
respective paths (see Eq. 20–12).
SOLUTION We write a ratio for the masses, using Eq. 20–12:
