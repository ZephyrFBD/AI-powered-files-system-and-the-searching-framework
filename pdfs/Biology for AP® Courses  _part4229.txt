d the continental shelf (Figure 35.21). The bottom
of the benthic realm is comprised of sand, silt, and dead organisms. Temperature decreases, remaining above freezing, as
water depth increases. This is a nutrient-rich portion of the ocean because of the dead organisms that fall from the upper
layers of the ocean. Because of this high level of nutrients, a diversity of fungi, sponges, sea anemones, marine worms, sea
stars, fishes, and bacteria exist.
The deepest part of the ocean is the abyssal zone, which is at depths of 4000 m or greater. The abyssal zone (Figure 35.21)
is very cold and has very high pressure, high oxygen content, and low nutrient content. There are a variety of invertebrates
and fishes found in this zone, but the abyssal zone does not have plants because of the lack of light. Hydrothermal vents are
found primarily in the abyssal zone; chemosynthetic bacteria utilize the hydrogen sulfide and other minerals emitted from
the vents. These chemosynthetic bacteria use the
