solutions. In general, as the H—A bond polarity increases, to draw more electron density from 
H, the stronger the acid.
t H—A Bond Strength The strength of the bond 
 (Section 8.8) also helps deter-
mine whether a molecule containing an H—A bond donates a proton. Very strong 
bonds are less easily broken than weaker ones. This factor is important, for example, 
in the hydrogen halides. The H—F bond is the most polar H—A bond. You there-
fore might expect HF to be a very strong acid if bond polarity were all that mattered. 
However, the H—A bond strength increases as you move up the group: 299 kJ/mol in 
HI, 366 kJ/mol in HBr, 431 kJ/mol in HCl, and 567 kJ/mol in HF. Because HF has the 
highest bond strength among the hydrogen halides, it is a weak acid, whereas all the 
other hydrogen hal
