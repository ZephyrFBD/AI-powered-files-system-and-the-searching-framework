h lack that trait is that the gene for that trait is
recessive and that both parents are heterozygous (carriers). (C) is thus
correct. (A) is incorrect because it provides a less likely explanation of
the result; non-deleterious mutations are quite rare, so it is far more
probable that the parents were simply carriers of a recessive gloving
gene. (B) is incorrect because a dominant allele is always expressed, so
it would not be possible in this circumstance for both parents to lack
gloving. (D) is incorrect because a recessive allele will not be expressed
unless it is received from both parents.

If men require only one copy of the mutant allele to have malaria
resistance, but women must be homozygous (i.e., require two copies),
then the malaria resistance allele must be X-linked recessive. (A) is
thus correct. (B) is incorrect because the results provide no
information about the geographic distribution of the allele. (C) is
