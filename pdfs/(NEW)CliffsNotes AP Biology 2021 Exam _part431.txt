oactivity, and heat.
Complex molecules, such as amino acids, formed. These kinds of molecules would later serve as monomers, or unit
building blocks, for the synthesis of polymers.
Simple molecules were able to form only because oxygen was absent. As a very reactive molecule, oxygen, had it
been present, would have prevented the formation of organic molecules by supplanting most reactants in chemical
reactions.
Chemist Stanley Miller simulated primordial conditions by applying electric sparks to simple gases (but no oxygen)
connected to a flask of heated water. After one week, the water contained various organic molecules, including
amino acids.
4. Polymers and self-replicating molecules were synthesized. 
Monomers combined to form polymers. Some of these reactions may have occurred by dehydration condensation, in
which polymers formed from monomers by the removal of water molecules.
Self-replicating molecules, like DNA or RNA, form. DNA may have been fashioned before RNA, but the rece
