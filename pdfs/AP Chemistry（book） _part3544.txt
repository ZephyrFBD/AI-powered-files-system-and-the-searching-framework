Give It Some Thought
What is the net reaction of Equations 22.29 and 22.30?
Commercial sulfuric acid is 98% H2SO4. It is a dense, colorless, oily liquid. It is a strong 
acid, a good dehydrating agent (Figure 22.18), and a moderately good oxidizing agent.

Year after year, the production of sulfuric acid is the largest of any chemical pro-
duced in the United States. It is employed in some way in almost all manufacturing.
Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, but only the first hydrogen is completely ionized in 
aqueous solution:
 
H2SO41aq2 ¡ H+1aq2 + HSO4

Consequently, sulfuric acid forms both sulfates 1SO4
