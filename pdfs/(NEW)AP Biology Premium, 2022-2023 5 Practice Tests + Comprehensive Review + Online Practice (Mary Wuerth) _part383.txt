t likely involved in glycolysis because glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of all living cells,
and PDHA1 is expressed in all the tissues in the experiment.
(d) Since insulin is released when blood sugar levels are high, it is likely that the levels of insulin would be low
when blood sugar levels are low. Therefore, when blood sugar levels are low, it is expected that both the
INS mRNA and the insulin protein levels would be low.

Overview
The phenotype of an organism is determined by the genes that are expressed and the levels at which those genes are
expressed. Regulation of gene expression is important in determining an organism’s phenotype. Genes can be
regulated by the interaction of regulatory proteins with regulatory sequences in the genome. Regulatory prot
