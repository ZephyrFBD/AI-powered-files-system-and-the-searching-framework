s (present, boiled, or absent) are two independent variables in this
experiment. Treatment I establishes that photosynthesis occurs (DPIP turns clear) when light and healthy
chloroplasts are present. Removing light (Treatment II) tests if light is necessary for photosynthesis, and removing
chloroplasts (Treatment IV) tests if chloroplasts are necessary. Treatment III tests for the effect of heat on
chloroplasts, which is not part of the hypothesis being investigated in this question. Furthermore, the boiled-
chloroplast (Treatment III) is a poor substitute for the no-chloroplasts (Treatment IV) because alternative hypothesis
are introduced. For example, one could argue that chloroplasts have nothing to do with photosynthesis and that the
boiled chloroplasts are decreasing photosynthetic activity because they release substances that interfere with
photosynthesis.
