tical fluid expands to 
fill its container (like a gas), but the molecules are still quite closely spaced (like a liquid).
Like liquids, supercritical fluids can behave as solvents dissolving a wide range of 
substances. Using supercritical fluid extraction, the components of mixtures can be sepa-
rated from one another. Supercritical fluid extraction has been successfully used to sep-
arate complex mixtures in the chemical, food, pharmaceutical, and energy industries. 
Supercritical CO2 is a popular choice because it is relatively inexpensive and, if used in 
closed-loop systems, may be a way to reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.
11.5 âˆ£ Vapor Pressure
Molecules can escape from the surface of a liquid into the gas phase by evaporation. Sup-
pose we place a quantity of ethanol 1CH3CH2OH2 in an evacuated, closed container, as 
in Figure 11.23. The ethanol quickly begins to evaporate. As a result, the pressure exerted
