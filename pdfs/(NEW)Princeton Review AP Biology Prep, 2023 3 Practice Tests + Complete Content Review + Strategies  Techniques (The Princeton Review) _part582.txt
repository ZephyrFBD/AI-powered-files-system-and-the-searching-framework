Bb and Bb is the correct set of genotypes that represents a cross that could produce offspring with silver fur
from parents that both have brown fur. Complete a Punnett square for this question. In order for the offspring
to have silver fur, both parents must have the silver allele.

Retroviruses have an RNA genome (hereditary material, eliminating (B)) that must be reverse-transcribed into
DNA (which is the opposite of the Central Dogma first step) and therefore (A) is correct. The codon sequence
is used by all things that do translation (like viruses, eliminating (C)). Retroviruses use transcription as well
after their genome has been reverse transcribed, so (D) is also incorrect.

All of the choices are examples of hydrolysis except the conversion of pyruvic acid to glucose. Hydrolysis is
the breaking of a covalent bo
