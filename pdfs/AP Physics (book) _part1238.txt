I) An elastic cord is 61 cm long when a weight of 75 N
hangs from it but is 85 cm long when a weight of 210 N hangs
from it. What is the “spring” constant k of this elastic cord?
4. (II) Estimate the stiffness of the spring in a child’s pogo
stick if the child has a mass of 32 kg and bounces once
every 2.0 seconds.
5. (II) A fisherman’s scale stretches 3.6 cm when a 2.4-kg fish
hangs from it. (a) What is the spring stiffness constant and
(b) what will be the amplitude and frequency of oscillation
if the fish is pulled down 2.1 cm more and released so that
it oscillates up and down?
6. (II) A small fly of mass 0.22 g is caught in a spider’s web.
The web oscillates predominantly with a frequency of 4.0 Hz.
(a) What is the value of the effective spring stiffness con-
stant k for the web? (b) At what frequency would you expect
the web to oscillate if an insect of mass 0.44 g were trapped?
7. (II) A mass m at the end of a spring oscillates with a 
frequency of 0.83 Hz. When an additional 78
