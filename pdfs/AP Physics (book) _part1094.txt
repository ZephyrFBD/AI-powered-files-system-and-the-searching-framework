h a brief discussion of pumps, including the heart.
Pumps can be classified into categories according to their function. A vacuum pump
is designed to reduce the pressure (usually of air) in a given vessel. A force pump,
on the other hand, is a pump that is intended to increase the pressure—for
example, to lift a liquid (such as water from a well) or to push a fluid through a
pipe. Figure 10–39 illustrates the principle behind a simple reciprocating pump.
It could be a vacuum pump, in which case the intake is connected to the vessel 
to be evacuated. A similar mechanism is used in some force pumps, and in this
case the fluid is forced under increased pressure through the outlet.
Another type of pump is the centrifugal pump, shown in Fig. 10–40. It, or any
force pump, can be used as a circulating pump—that is, to circulate a fluid around a
closed path, such as the cooling water or lubricating oil in an automobile.
