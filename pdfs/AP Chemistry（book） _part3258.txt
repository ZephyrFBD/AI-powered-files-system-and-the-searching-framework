H2(g) is oxidized 
to form H+.

generated by H2 oxidation at the anode to migrate to the cathode, where H2O is formed.
oxidize than iron, and stress on the iron. The corrosion process involves oxidation and 
reduction, and the metal conducts electricity. Thus, electrons can move through the 
metal from a region where oxidation occurs to a region where reduction occurs, as in 
voltaic cells. Because the sta
