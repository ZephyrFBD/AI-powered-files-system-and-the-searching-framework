a
population can increase when the birth rate is at its maximum and the
death rate is at its minimum. The second is environmental resistance,
which includes the limits set by the living and nonliving environment
that decrease birth rates. These limits can be either density-
dependent, such as availability of food, predation, and disease, or
density-independent, such as weather and climate. When a population
is first being established and these limits are not yet a problem, ideal
conditions encourage exponential growth, as seen in the figure above
and described by (B). (C) is incorrect because the data is simply
suggesting that environmental constraints have not yet begun to aï¬€ect
the population growth rate. However, when constraints do become a
limiting factor, this rapid growth rate will be unable to continue
indefinitely. As a result, all populations that exhibit exponential
growth eventually stabilize or crash, resulting in a plateau and a more
sustainable logistic growth model. The
