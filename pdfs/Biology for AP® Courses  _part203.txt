H-) ions. While the hydroxide ions are kept in
solution by their hydrogen bonding with other water molecules, the hydrogen ions, consisting of naked protons, are
immediately attracted to un-ionized water molecules, forming hydronium ions (H30+). Still, by convention, scientists refer
to hydrogen ions and their concentration as if they were free in this state in liquid water.
The concentration of hydrogen ions dissociating from pure water is 1 × 10-7 moles H+ ions per liter of water. Moles (mol)
are a way to express the amount of a substance (which can be atoms, molecules, ions, etc), with one mole being equal
to 6.02 × 1023 particles of the substance. Therefore, 1 mole of water is equal to 6.02 × 1023 water molecules. The pH is
calculated as the negative of the base 10 logarithm of this concentration. The log10 of 1 × 10-7 is -7.0, and the negative of
this number (indicated by the “p” of “pH”) yields a pH of 7.0, which is also known as neutral pH. The pH inside of human
cells and blood
