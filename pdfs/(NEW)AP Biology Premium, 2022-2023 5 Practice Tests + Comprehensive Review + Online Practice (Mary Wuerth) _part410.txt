DNA in the cellâ€™s cytoplasm. One method of transforming bacteria involves heat shock, in which bacterial cells are
mixed with foreign DNA and then quickly exposed to a cold-hot-cold temperature transition. This heat shock creates
temporary microscopic pores through which the foreign DNA can enter some of the bacterial cells.
The foreign plasmid DNA needs a selectable marker so that cells that have incorporated the plasmid DNA can be
detected. The selectable marker is usually an antibiotic resistance gene that is not present in nontransformed
bacterial cells. By growing the transformed bacteria on an agar plate that contains the antibiotic, one can select for
the bacteria that absorbed and are now expressing the genes from the plasmid.
If the plasmid contains a gene from another organism, it is called recombinant DNA. Recombinant DNA is
simply DNA that has been recombined from different source organisms. DNA can be cut at specific sequences using
restriction endonucl
