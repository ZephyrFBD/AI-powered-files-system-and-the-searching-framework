produced by the pituitary. Figure 28.4 illustrates
these peptide hormones.
Secreted peptides like insulin are stored within vesicles in the cells that synthesize them. They are then released in response
to stimuli such as high blood glucose levels in the case of insulin. Amino acid-derived and polypeptide hormones are water-
soluble and insoluble in lipids. These hormones cannot pass through plasma membranes of cells; therefore, their receptors
are found on the surface of the target cells.
Figure 28.4 The structures of peptide hormones (a) oxytocin, (b) growth hormone, and (c) follicle-stimulating hormone
are shown. These peptide hormones are much larger than those derived from cholesterol or amino acids.
