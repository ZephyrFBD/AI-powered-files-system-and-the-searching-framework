 circuit,
coupled with a gas-filled tube as a
switch, can produce (b) a repeating
“sawtooth” voltage.
A discharging RC circuit. If a charged capacitor,
is connected to a resistance 
as in Fig. 19–21a, how much
time will elapse until the voltage falls to 10% of its original (maximum) value?
APPROACH The voltage across the capacitor decreases according to 
We set
(10% of 
), but first we need to calculate
SOLUTION The time constant for this circuit is given by
After a time the voltage across the capacitor will be
We want to know the time 
for which 
We substitute into the
above equation
so
The inverse operation to the exponential e is the natural log, ln. Thus
Solving for , we find the elapsed time is
NOTE We can find the time for any specified voltage across a capacitor by
using t = RC lnAV
