of energy, we often use kilojoules (kJ) in discuss-
ing the energies associated with chemical reactions. For example, the amount of heat 
released when hydrogen and oxygen react to form 1 g of water is 16 kJ.
It is still quite common in chemistry, biology, and biochemistry to find energy 
changes associated with chemical reactions expressed in the non-SI unit of calories. A 
calorie (cal) was originally defined as the amount of energy required to raise the tem-
perature of 1 g of water from 14.5 to 15.5 °C. It has since been defined in terms of a joule:
1 cal = 4.184 J (exactly)
A related energy unit that is familiar to anyone who has read a food label is the 
 
nutritional Calorie (note the capital C), which is 1000 times larger than calorie with a 
lowercase c: 1 Cal = 1000 cal = 1 kcal.

rearranging to solve for the mass of water:
m =
w
g * d =
4.1 * 108 J
(9.8 m/s2)(75 m)
=
4.1 * 108 kg@m2/s2
(9.8 m/s2)(75 m)
= 5.6 * 105 kg
