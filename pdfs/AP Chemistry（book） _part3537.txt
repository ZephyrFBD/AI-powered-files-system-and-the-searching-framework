 a mild antiseptic. Somewhat more concentrated solutions are used to bleach 
fabrics.
The peroxide ion is a by-product of metabolism that results from the reduction of O2.
The body disposes of this reactive ion with enzymes such as peroxidase and catalase.

The Other Group 6A Elements:  
S, Se, Te, and Po
The other group 6A elements are sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium. Of these, 
sulfur is the most important, and polonium, which has no stable isotopes and is found 
only in minute quantities in radium-containing minerals, is least important.
The group 6A elements possess the general outer-electron configuration ns2np4 with 
n ranging from 2 to 6. Thus, these elements attain a noble-gas electron configuration by
