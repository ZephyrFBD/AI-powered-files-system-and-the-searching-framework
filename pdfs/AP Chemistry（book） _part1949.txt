Carbon on the Nanoscale
We have seen that elemental carbon is quite versatile. In its bulk sp3@hybridized solid- 
state form, it is diamond; in its bulk sp2@hybridized solid-state form, it is graph-
ite. Over the past three decades, scientists have discovered that sp2@hybridized 
carbon can also form discrete molecules, one-dimensional nanoscale tubes, and two- 
dimensional nanoscale sheets. Each of these forms of carbon shows very interesting 
properties.
Until the mid-1980s, pure solid carbon was thought to exist in only two forms: the 
covalent-network solids diamond and graphite. In 1985, however, a group of researchers 
led by Richard Smalley and Robert Curl of Rice University and Harry Kroto of the Uni-
versity of Sussex, England, vaporized a sample of graphite with an intense pulse of laser 
light and used a stream of helium gas to carry the vaporized carbon into a mass spec-
trometer.
