1–15 Resonance in AC Circuits
The rms current in an LRC series circuit is given by (see Eqs. 21–14, 21–15, 21–11b,
and 21–12b):
(21;18)
Because the reactance of inductors and capacitors depends on the frequency f of
the source, the current in an LRC circuit depends on frequency. From Eq. 21–18
we see that the current will be maximum at a frequency that satisfies
We solve this for f, and call the solution 
(21;19)
When 
the circuit is in resonance, and 
is the resonant frequency of the
circuit. At this frequency,
so the impedance is purely resistive. A graph
of 
versus f is shown in Fig. 21–46 for particular values of R, L,
