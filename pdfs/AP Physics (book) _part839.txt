ulley,
and the linear version to the bucket,
SOLUTION Let 
be the tension in the cord.Then a force 
acts at the edge of the
pulley, and we apply Newton’s second law, Eq. 8–14, for the rotation of the pulley:
[pulley]
Next we look at the (linear) motion of the bucket of mass m. Figure 8–22b, the
free-body diagram for the bucket, shows that two forces act on the bucket:
the force of gravity mg acts downward, and the tension of the cord 
pulls
upward. Applying Newton’s second law,
for the bucket, we have
(taking downward as positive):
[bucket]
Note that the tension 
which is the force exerted on the edge of the pulley, is
not equal to the weight of the bucket 
There must be a net
force on the bucket if it is accelerating, so 
We can also see this from
the last equation above,
To obtain 
we note that the tangential acceleration of a point on the 
edge of the pulley is the same as the acceleration of the bucket if the cord 
doesn’t stretch or slip. Hence we can use Eq. 8–5,
