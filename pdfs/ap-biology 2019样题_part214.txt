ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
c. Chemical experiments have shown that it is 
possible to form complex organic molecules 
from inorganic molecules in the absence  
of life—
 i.	 Organic molecules/monomers served 
as building blocks for the formation of 
more complex molecules, including amino 
acids and nucleotides.
ii. The joining of these monomers produced 
polymers with the ability to replicate, 
store, and transfer information.
SYI-3.E.2
The RNA World Hypothesis proposes that RNA 
could have been the earliest genetic material.
