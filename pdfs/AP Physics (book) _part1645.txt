SEER rating
A good heat pump can sometimes be a money saver and an energy saver,
depending on the cost of the unit and installation, etc. Compare, for example,
our heat pump in Example 15–12 to, say, a 1500-W electric heater. We plug the
heater into the wall, it draws 1500 W of electricity, and it delivers 1500 W of heat to
the room. Our heat pump when plugged into the wall also draws 1500 W of elec-
tricity (which is what we pay for), but it delivers 4500 W of heat!
SEER Rating
Cooling devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners are often given a rating
known as SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio), which is defined as
as measured by averaging over varying (seasonal) conditions. The definition of the
SEER is basically the same as the COP except for the (unfortunate) mixed units.
Given that
