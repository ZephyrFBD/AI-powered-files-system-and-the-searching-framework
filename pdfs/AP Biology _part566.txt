 because it is an initial steep
downward curve. This line represents that the highest mortality
occurs early in life due to a lack of protective parenting, which is
characteristic of external fertilization. Choice A describes a K-
strategist because there is an initial flat line (representing a low
death rate among the young as a result of intensive parenting)
followed by a quick drop off (which represents death during old
age). Choice B is incorrect because r-strategists and K-strategists
each have their own characteristic survivorship curves that do not
vary. Choice D is incorrect because there is one line that represents
the survivorship curve of an r-strategist. (ENE-1)
(C) Fertilization is external with no parenting, so survival of the
young is poor. This is why the curve dips steeply initially. (SYI-1)
(C) Density-dependent factors have to do with population density
and all things related to that, such as disease and starvation. Density-
independent factors are factors that affec
