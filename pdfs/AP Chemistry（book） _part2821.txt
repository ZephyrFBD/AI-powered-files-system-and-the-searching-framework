 17.33  The accompanying graph shows the titration curves for two 
monoprotic acids. (a) Which curve is that of a strong acid? 
(b) What is the approximate pH at the equivalence point 
of each titration? (c) 40.0 mL of each acid was titrated with 
a 0.100 M base. Which acid is more concentrated? (d) Esti-
mate the pKa of the weak acid.
 17.34  Compare the titration of a strong, monoprotic acid with a 
strong base to the titration of a weak, monoprotic acid with 
a strong base. Assume the strong and weak acid solutions 
initially have the same concentrations. Indicate whether 
the following statements are true or false. (a) More base is 
25.0 mL of 1.0 M HNO3(aq)
25.0 mL of 1.0 M CH3COOH(aq)
required to reach the equivalence point for the strong acid 
than the weak acid. (b) The pH at the beginning of the ti-
tration is lower for the weak acid than the strong acid. (c) 
The pH at the equivalence point is 7 no matter which acid 
is titrated.
