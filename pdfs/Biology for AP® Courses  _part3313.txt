ifferent cell types, they only affect cells that possess
the necessary receptors. Receptors for a specific hormone may be found on many different cells or may be limited to a
small number of specialized cells. For example, thyroid hormones act on many different tissue types, stimulating metabolic
activity throughout the body. Cells can have many receptors for the same hormone but often also possess receptors for
different types of hormones. The number of receptors that respond to a hormone determines the cellâ€™s sensitivity to that
hormone, and the resulting cellular response. Additionally, the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change
over time, resulting in increased or decreased cell sensitivity. In up-regulation, the number of receptors increases in
response to rising hormone levels, making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity.
When the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels, called down-regulation,
