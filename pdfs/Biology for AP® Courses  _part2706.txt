light to germinate. Other effects of GAs include gender expression, seedless fruit development, and the delay of senescence
in leaves and fruit. Seedless grapes are obtained through standard breeding methods and contain inconspicuous seeds that
fail to develop. Because GAs are produced by the seeds, and because fruit development and stem elongation are under GA
control, these varieties of grapes would normally produce small fruit in compact clusters. Maturing grapes are routinely
treated with GA to promote larger fruit size, as well as looser bunches (longer stems), which reduces the instance of mildew
infection (Figure 23.40).

Abscisic Acid
The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) was first discovered as the agent that causes the abscission or dropping of cotton
bolls. However, more recent studies indicate that ABA p
