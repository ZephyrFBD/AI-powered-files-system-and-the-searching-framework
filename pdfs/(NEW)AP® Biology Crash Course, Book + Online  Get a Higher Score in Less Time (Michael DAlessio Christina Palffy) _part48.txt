intermediates used in the synthesis of the other organic molecules (amino acids, lipids, etc.) needed by the
cell.
B. Some form of cellular respiration takes place in nearly all organisms.
1. Glycolysis is the oldest metabolic pathway, is virtually universal, and takes place in the cytoplasm of
cells.
2. Aerobic respiration—the Krebs (or citric acid) Cycle, electron transport, and chemiosmosis—takes
place in mitochondria in eukaryotes.
C. Refer to this overall equation for cell respiration:
Although this equation is almost the reverse of the equation for photosynthesis, the two processes involve
different enzymes and biochemical pathways, as well as different organelles.
D. Cells may utilize an anaerobic pathway (fermentation) that does not require O2, or an aerobic pathway
that does require O2.
1. Glycolysis is the first step of both pathways. This step does not require O2.
2. Aerobic respiration has three additional steps, the second of which requires O2, as the final electron
