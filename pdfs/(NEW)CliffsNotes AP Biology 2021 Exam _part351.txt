s not bind to the operator. As a result, the RNA polymerase proceeds to
transcribe the structural genes necessary to produce enzymes that synthesize tryptophan. When tryptophan is
available to E. coli from the surrounding environment, the bacterium no longer needs to manufacture its own
tryptophan. In this case, rising levels of tryptophan induce some tryptophan to react with the inactive repressor and
make it active. Here, tryptophan is acting as a corepressor. The active repressor now binds to the operator region,
which, in turn, prevents the transcription of the structural genes. Since these structural genes stop producing
enzymes only in the presence of an active repressor, they are called repressible enzymes, and the operon is a
repressible operon. Because a repressor protein is involved, it is an example of negative regulation.
2. The lac operon in E. coli controls the breakdown of lactose. A regulatory gene produces an active repressor that
binds to the operator region. When the
