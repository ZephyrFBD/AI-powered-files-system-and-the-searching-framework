▶Practice Exercise 1
The Goodyear blimp contains 5.74 * 106 L of helium at 
25 °C and 1.00 atm. What is the mass in grams of the helium 
inside the blimp? 
(a) 2.30 * 107 g (b) 2.80 * 106 g (c) 1.12 * 107 g  
(d) 2.34 * 105 g (e) 9.39 * 105 g
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Tennis balls are usually filled with either air or N2 gas to 
a pressure above atmospheric pressure to increase their 
bounce. If a tennis ball has a volume of 144 cm3 and con-
tains 0.33 g of N2 gas, what is the pressure inside the ball at 
24 °C?
In this chapter, we encounter a variety of problems based on the 
ideal-gas equation, which contains four variables—P, V, n, and 
 
T—and one constant, R. Depending on the type of problem, we 
might need to solve for any of the four variables.
To extract the necessary information from problems involving 
more than one variable, we suggest the following steps:
 1. Tabulate information. Read the problems carefully to deter-
mine which variable is the unknown and
