be out the forward hatch so that its speed relative to
the planet that you are approaching is 0.95c. With what
speed must it leave your ship?
v2 = –0.80c
v1 = ±0.70c
54. What is the speed of a particle when its kinetic energy
equals its rest energy? Does the mass of the particle affect
the result?
55. The nearest star to Earth is Proxima Centauri, 4.3 light-
years away. (a) At what constant velocity must a spacecraft
travel from Earth if it is to reach the star in 4.9 years, as
measured by travelers on the spacecraft? (b) How long does
the trip take according to Earth observers?

that determines the length contraction and the time
dilation is given by
