Positive feedback works by signal transduction.
Positive feedback relies on stimuli from only outside the body.

Feedback mechanisms maintain internal body temperatures within
many animals. Faced with fluctuations in environmental
temperatures, an animal manages its internal body temperature by
regulating it or by conforming to the environment. Which graph
below shows the correct relationship between internal body
temperatures and environmental temperature fluctuations for the
bottlenose dolphin (wh
