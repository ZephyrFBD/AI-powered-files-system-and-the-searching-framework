 pressure is not constant, so we can’t use Eq. 15–3 
.
Instead, we can use the first law of thermodynamics to find W because we can
determine 
(from 
) and
(the process is adiabatic).
SOLUTION We determine 
from Eq. 14–1 for the internal energy of an
ideal monatomic gas, using subscripts f and i for final and initial states:
Then, from the first law of thermodynamics, Eq.15–1, the work done by the gas is
W = Q - ¢U = 0 - (–2300 J) = 2300 J.

for boiling water to steam. Determine the change in
internal energy of 1.00 liter of water (mass 1.00 kg) at 100°C when it is fully boiled
from liquid to gas, which results in 1671 liters of steam at 100°C. Assume the
process is done at atmospheric pressure.
APPROACH Our system is the water. The heat required here does not res
