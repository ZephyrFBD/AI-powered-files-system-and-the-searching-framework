ned between the two compartments separated by the inner
mitochondrial membrane.
Q and Complex II
Complex II directly receives FADH2, which does not pass through complex I. The compound connecting the first and
second complexes to the third is ubiquinone (Q). The Q molecule is lipid soluble and freely moves through the hydrophobic
core of the membrane. Once it is reduced, (QH2), ubiquinone delivers its electrons to the next complex in the electron
transport chain. Q receives the electrons derived from NADH from complex I, and the electrons derived from FADH2 from
complex II. This enzyme and FADH2 form a small complex that delivers electrons directly to the electron transport chain,
bypassing the first complex. Since these electrons bypass and thus do not energize the proton pump in the first complex,
fewer ATP molecules are made from the FADH2 electrons. The number of ATP molecules ultimately obtained is directly
proportional to the number of protons pumped across the inner mitochondria
