∆G° = -RT ln K2, we can 
relate E to K as well.
CELL POTENTIALS UNDER NONSTANDARD CONDITIONS (SEC-
TION 20.6) The emf of a redox reaction varies with temperature and 
with the concentrations of reactants and products. The Nernst equa-
tion relates the emf under nonstandard conditions to the standard 
emf and the reaction quotient Q:
 
E = E° - 1RT>nF2 ln Q = E° - 10.0592>n2 log Q 
The factor 0.0592 is valid when T = 298 K. A concentration cell is a 
voltaic cell in which the same half-reaction occurs at both the anode 
and the cathode but with different concentrations of reactants in 
each half-cell. At equilibrium, Q = K and E = 0.
BATTERIES AND FUEL CELLS (SECTION 20.7) A battery is a 
self-contained electrochemical power source that contains one or 
more voltaic cells. Batteries are based on a variety of different redox 
reactions. Batteries that cannot be recharged are called primary 
cells, while those that can be recharged are called secondary cells.
