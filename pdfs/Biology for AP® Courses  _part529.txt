 a cell’s recognition sites. These “cell-specific” proteins play a vital role in immune function;
enable cells of a certain type (e.g., liver cells) to identify each other when forming a tissue; and allow hormones and other
molecules to recognize target cells. These proteins “float” throughout the membrane, constantly in flux.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined in
Big Idea 2 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The learning objectives provide a transparent foundation for the
AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam questions. A learning
objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
Big Idea 2
Biological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,
and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.
