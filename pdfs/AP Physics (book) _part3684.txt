all outside the main sequence. Above and to the right we find
extremely large stars, with high luminosities but with low (reddish) color
temperature: these are called red giants. At the lower left, there are a few stars of
low luminosity but with high temperature: these are the white dwarfs.
Distance to a star using the H–R diagram
and color. Suppose that detailed study of a certain star suggests that it most
likely fits on the main sequence of an H–R diagram. Its measured apparent
brightness is
and the peak wavelength of its spectrum is
Estimate its distance from us.
APPROACH We find the temperature using Wien’s law, Eq.27–2. The luminosity
is estimated for a main-sequence star on the H–R diagram of Fig. 33–6, and
then the distance is found using the relation between brightness and luminosity,
Eq. 33–1.
SOLUTION The star’s temperature, from Wien’s law (Eq. 27–2), is
A star on the main sequence of an H–R diagram at this temperature has lumi-
