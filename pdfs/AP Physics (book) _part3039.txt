in practice, aberrations in the magnetic lenses limit the resolution in transmission
electron microscopes to about 0.1 to 0.5 nm. This is still 1000 times better than a
visible-light microscope, and corresponds to a useful magnification of about a
million. Such magnifications are difficult to achieve, and more common magnifi-

The maximum resolution of a scanning electron microscope
is less, typically 5 to 10 nm although new high-resolution SEMs approach 1 nm.

microscope. Scanning coils move an
electron beam back and forth across
the specimen. Secondary electrons
produced when the beam strikes the
specimen are collected and their
intensity affects the brightness of
pixels in a monitor to produce a
picture.
The scanning tunneling electron microscope (STM), developed in the 1980s,
