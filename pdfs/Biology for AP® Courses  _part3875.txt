he adrenal medulla under extreme
stress. This hormone constricts the smooth
muscles of the blood vessels. It constricts the
afferent arterioles, causing the flow of blood into
the nephrons to stop.
b.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are the “fight or
flight” hormones that are released by the adrenal
medulla and the nervous system, respectively,
under extreme stress. These hormones constrict
the smooth muscles of the blood vessels. They
constrict the afferent arterioles, causing the flow
of blood into the nephrons to stop.
c.
ADH is the “fight or flight” hormone that is
released by the adrenal medulla under extreme
stress. This hormone constricts the smooth
muscles of the blood vessels. It constricts the
efferent arterioles, causing the flow of blood into
the nephrons to stop.
