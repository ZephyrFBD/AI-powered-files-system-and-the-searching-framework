2-methylpropene? (a) propane, (b) butane, (c) 2-methylbutane,  
(d) 2-methylpropane, (e) 2-methylpropyne.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Addition of HCl to an alkene forms 2-chloropropane. What 
is the alkene?
Aromatic Hydrocarbons
The simplest aromatic hydrocarbon, benzene 1C6H62, is shown in Figure 24.10 along with 
some other aromatic hydrocarbons. Benzene is the most important aromatic hydrocar-
bon, and most of our discussion focuses on it. When the C6H5–group is a substituent in a 
compound, it is known (confusingly) as the phenyl group.

As the understanding of chemistry has grown, chemists have 
advanced from simply cataloging reactions that occur to explaining 
how they occur, by drawing the individual steps of a reaction based 
upon experimental and theoretical evidence. The sum of these steps 
is termed a reaction me
