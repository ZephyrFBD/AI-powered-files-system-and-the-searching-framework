nously with
candy (conditioned stimulus) become associated through
repetition. The response of the patient to a shot of
epinephrine is the proliferation of natural killer, NK, cells
(a cell type of the innate immune system). After
conditioning, the patient displayed an increase in NK cells
in response to the candy.
The drug cyclosporine is used to suppress immune
rejection of organ transplants by inhibiting production of
interleukin, a cytokine messenger that increases expression
in T cells.
D. Design an experiment to test the use of conditioning
using the administration of cyclosporine as the
unconditioned stimulus and sugar water as the conditioned
stimulus by measuring the blood concentration of
interleukin. Assume that interleukin is flushed from the
blood in a single day. In your design include a vehicle
control where conditions are identical to the treatment and
a “do-nothing” or naïve control.
