surface, the maximum kinetic energy of emitted electrons
is 1.40 eV. What is the work function of the metal?
25. (II) The threshold wavelength for emission of electrons
from a given surface is 340 nm. What will be the maximum
kinetic energy of ejected electrons when the wavelength is
changed to (a) 280 nm, (b) 360 nm?
26. (II) A certain type of film is sensitive only to light whose
wavelength is less than 630 nm. What is the energy (eV and
) needed for the chemical reaction to occur which
causes the film to change?
27. (II) When 250-nm light falls on a metal, the current through a
photoelectric circuit (Fig.27â€“6) is brought to zero at a stopping
voltage of 1.64 V. What is the work function of the metal?
28. (II) In a photoelectric experiment using a clean sodium
surface, the maximum energy of the emitted electrons was
measured for a number of different incident frequencies,
with the following results.
