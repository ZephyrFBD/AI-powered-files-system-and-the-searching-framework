(Chapter 17) of the two particles at this distance equals the minimum total
kinetic energy of the two particles when far apart. The average kinetic energy is
related to Kelvin temperature by Eq. 13–8.
SOLUTION The radii of the two nuclei (
and 
) are given by
Eq. 30–1:
so
We equate
the kinetic energy of the two initial particles to the potential energy when at this
distance:
Thus,
and if we ask that the average kinetic energy be this
high, then from Eq. 13–8,
we have a temperature of
NOTE More careful calculations show that the temperature required for fusion
is actually about an order of magnitude less than this rough estimate, partly
because it is not necessary that the average kinetic energy be 0.22 MeV—a small
percentage of nuclei with this much energy (in the high-energy tail of the Maxwell
distribution, Fig. 13–20) would be sufficient. Reasonable estimates for a usable
fusion reactor are in the range
to
A high temperature is required for a fusion reactor. But there must also b
