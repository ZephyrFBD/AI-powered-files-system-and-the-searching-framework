Note that

the curve (that speed is called the
“most probable speed,”
). This is
because the curve is skewed to the
right: it is not symmetrical.

Speeds of air molecules. What is the rms speed of air
molecules (

) at room temperature (20°C)?
APPROACH To obtain 
we need the masses of 
and 
molecules and
then apply Eq. 13–9 to oxygen and nitrogen separately, since they have differ-
ent masses.
SOLUTION The masses of one molecule of
