the nights become longer, autumn is approaching. This information, along with sensing temperature and
water availability, allows plants to determine the time of the year and adjust their physiology accordingly. Short-day (long-
night) plants use this information to flower in the late summer and early fall, when nights exceed a critical length (often
eight or fewer hours). Long-day (short-night) plants flower during the spring, when darkness is less than a critical length
(often eight to 15 hours). Not all plants use the phytochrome system in this way. Flowering in day-neutral plants is not
regulated by daylength.

Horticulturist
The word “horticulturist” comes from the Latin words for garden (hortus) and culture (cultura). This career
has been revolutionized by progress made in the understanding of plant responses to environmental stimuli.
Growers of crops, fruit, vegetables, and flowers were previously constrained by having to time their sowin
