be 
removed. One common removal method is called the Claus 
process, which relies on the reaction:
 
 
8 H2S1g2 + 4 O21g2 ยก S81l2 + 8 H2O1g2
 
 Under optimal conditions the Claus process gives 98% yield of S8 
from H2S. If you started with 30.0 g of H2S and 50.0 g of O2, how 
many grams of S8 would be produced, assuming 98% yield?
 3.86 When hydrogen sulfide gas is bubbled into a solution of so-
dium hydroxide, the reaction forms sodium sulfide and wa-
ter. How many grams of sodium sulfide are formed if 1.25 g 
of hydrogen sulfide is bubbled into a solution containing 
2.00 g of sodium hydroxide, assuming that the sodium sul-
fide is made in 92.0% yield?

 3.96 An organic compound was found to contain only C, H, and Cl. 
When a 1.50-g sample of the compound was completely com-
busted in air, 3.52 g of CO2 was formed. In a separate experi-
ment, the chlorine in a 1.00-g sample of the compound was 
converted to 1.27 g of AgCl. Determine th
