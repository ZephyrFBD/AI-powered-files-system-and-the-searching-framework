2. A weak acid only partially dissociates in aqueous solution and therefore exists in the 
solution as a mixture of the undissociated acid and its conjugate base. The conjugate 
base of a weak acid shows a slight ability to remove protons from water. (The conju-
gate base of a weak acid is a weak base.)
3. A substance with negligible acidity contains hydrogen but does not demonstrate any 
acidic behavior in water. Its conjugate base is a strong base, reacting completely with 
water, to form OH - ions. (The conjugate base of a substance with negligible acidity is a 
strong base.)
The ions H3O+1aq2 and OH -1aq2 are, respectively, the strongest possible acid and 
strongest possible base that can exist at equilibrium in aqueous solution. Stronger acids 
react with water to produce H3O+1aq2 ions, and stronger bases react with water to pro-
duce OH -1aq2 ions, a phenomenon known as the leveling effect.
We can think of proton-transfer reactions as being governed by the relative abilit
