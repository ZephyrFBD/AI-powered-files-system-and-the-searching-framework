e effect. An example of the
former is a caterpillar population being kept low
by a pesticide because it kills them regardless of
their numbers. In the case of the latter, a large
caterpillar population leads to a decrease in food
availability, which will cause the caterpillar
population to decline.
b.
Both are environmental conditions that result in
changes in population numbers. Density-
independent factors have the same effect at all
population densities whereas density-dependent
factors have different effects. An example of the
