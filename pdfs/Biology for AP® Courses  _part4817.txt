 are as high as 500 times the background rate, as determined from the fossil record, and are predicted to rise.
38.2 The Importance of Biodiversity to Human Life
Humans use many compounds that were first discovered or derived from living organisms as medicines: secondary plant
compounds, animal toxins, and antibiotics produced by bacteria and fungi. More medicines are expected to be discovered
in nature. Loss of biodiversity will impact the number of pharmaceuticals available to humans.
Crop diversity is a requirement for food security, and it is being lost. The loss of wild relatives to crops also threatens
breedersâ€™ abilities to create new varieties. Ecosystems provide ecosystem services that support human agriculture:
pollination, nutrient cycling, pest control, and soil development and maintenance. Loss of biodiversity threatens these
ecosystem services and risks making food production more expensive or impossible. Wild food sources are mainly
aquatic, but few are being managed for
