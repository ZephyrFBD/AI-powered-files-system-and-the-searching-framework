ia about 40,000
to 50,000 years ago, just after the arrival of humans in the area: a marsupial lion, a giant one-ton wombat, and several
giant kangaroo species disappeared. In North America, the extinctions of almost all of the large mammals occurred
10,000â€“12,000 years ago. All that are left are the smaller mammals such as bears, elk, moose, and cougars. Finally, on many
remote oceanic islands, the extinctions of many species occurred coincident with human arrivals. Not all of the islands had
large animals, but when there were large animals, they were lost. Madagascar was colonized about 2,000 years ago and the
large mammals that lived there became extinct. Eurasia and Africa do not show this pattern, but they also did not experience
a recent arrival of humans. Humans arrived in Eurasia hundreds of thousands of years ago after the origin of the species in
Africa. This topic remains an area of active research and hypothesizing. It seems clear that even if climate played a role, in
