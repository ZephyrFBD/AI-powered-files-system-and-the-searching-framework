 shown in Figure 19.6(a). After the stopcock is opened, the molecules travel 
randomly throughout the entire apparatus. As Figure 19.6(b) shows, there are four

If flask B were smaller than flask A, 
would the final pressure after the 
stopcock is opened be greater than, 
equal to, or less than 0.5 atm?

When stopcock opens, 
gas expands to occupy 
both flasks.
All gas molecules 
move back into flask A.
▲ Figure 19.5 Expansion of a gas into 
an evacuated space is a spontaneous 
process. The reverse process—gas 
molecules initially distributed evenly in 
two flasks all moving into one flask—is 
not spontaneous.

The two molecules are colored
red and blue to keep track of them.
