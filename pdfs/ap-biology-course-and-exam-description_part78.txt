the independent and dependent variables 
with units, correctly plot data points with 
appropriate scaling, and correctly represent 
the data in question. For instance, a line 
graph should be used for continuous 
data and a bar graph for categorical data. 
Students often fail to earn points because 
they draw error bars incorrectly and fail to 
use them to draw conclusions about the 
significance of the data.
Developing Understanding
The cell is the basic unit of life. Cells contribute to the organization of life and provide the 
environment in which organelles function. Organelles in turn provide compartmentalization and 
organize cellular products for dispersal and waste for disposal. Cells have membranes that allow 
them to establish and maintain an internal environment. These membranes also control the 
exchange of material with the cell’s external environment—an important, foundational concept. 
The maintenance of the internal and external conditions of a cell is called
