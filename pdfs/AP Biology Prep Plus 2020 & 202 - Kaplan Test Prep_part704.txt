e phenotype is:
2 × T × t = 2Tt = 2pq
and the frequency of the homozygous recessive phenotype is:
t × t = t2 = q2
Normally, success in mastering Hardy-Weinberg problems lies in the
reading of the question. You usually have to figure out p and q in order to
plug in the terms. If the question states “frequency of alleles in a
population,” then you should start with p + q = 1 and solve for p or q. If, on
the other hand, the problem says “frequencies of organisms that express
the trait (dominant or recessive),” then you start with p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 and
calculate your frequencies of p and q from this data. Once you have
calculated p and q, you can plug those values into the equation where
appropriate to figure out frequencies of homozygotes, heterozygotes, or
carriers for a trait.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
There are five assumptions that must be met for a population to
be under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium:
The population is very large and not subject to small
p
