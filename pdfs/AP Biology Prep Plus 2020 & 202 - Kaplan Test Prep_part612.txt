, the direction of
coiling in the mother determines the direction of coiling in all
oﬀspring. This suggests that something from the mother, perhaps
mRNA transcribed from her genes, is definitive for determining shell
handedness. (D) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because males and
females are actually crossed in the experiment, so the species could
not be parthenogenetic. (B) is incorrect because the coiling direction
of the mother seemed to have a definitive influence on coiling
direction in oﬀspring, so environmental factors could not be the only
determinant. (C) is incorrect because the shell handedness of the
males had no influence on the oﬀspring.

According to the question stem, the Hoxc9 regulatory complex
represses forelimb development in the posterior areas of the body,
which correspond to the caudal region. Thus, the complex is exerting
negative control in the caudal region, which will lead to forelimb
development in the rostral region. (A) is
