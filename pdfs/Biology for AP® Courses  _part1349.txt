her factor. For the F2 generation of a monohybrid cross, the following three
possible combinations of genotypes could result: homozygous dominant, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive. Because
heterozygotes could arise from two different pathways (receiving one dominant and one recessive allele from either parent),
and because heterozygotes and homozygous dominant individuals are phenotypically identical, the law supports Mendel’s
observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio. The equal segregation of alleles is the reason we can apply the Punnett square to accurately
predict the offspring of parents with known genotypes. The physical basis of Mendel’s law of segregation is the first division
of meiosis, in which the homologous chromosomes with their different versions of each gene are segregated into daughter
nuclei. The role of the meiotic segregation of chromosomes in sexual reproduction was not understood by the scientific
community during Mendel’s lifetime.
