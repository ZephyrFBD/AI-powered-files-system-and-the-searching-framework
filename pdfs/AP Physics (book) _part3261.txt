nics, electrons obey the exclusion principle and can be only in certain
possible energy levels or states. Electrons also obey a quantum statistics called
Fermi;Dirac statistics† that takes into account the exclusion principle. All parti-
cles that have spin 
(or other half-integral spin:
etc.), such as electrons,
protons, and neutrons, obey Fermi–Dirac statistics and are referred to as fermions
(see Section 28–7). The electron gas in a metal is often called a Fermi gas.
According to the exclusion principle, no two electrons in the metal can have the
same set of quantum numbers. Therefore, in each of the energy states available
for the electrons in our “gas,” there can be at most two electrons: one with spin up
and one with spin down 
Thus, at 
the possible
energy levels will be filled, two electrons each, up to a maximum level called the
Fermi level. This is shown in Fig. 29–21, where the vertical axis is the “density of
occupied states,” whose meaning is similar to the Maxwell distrib
