estigate mitosis using models. Your teacher will give you sockosomes, clay 
chromosomes, Pop-it Beads, or pipe-cleaner chromosomes. 
Review chromosome duplication and movement using these model chromosomes. 
Think about these questions as you review the cell cycle and mitosis. 
•  If a cell contains a set of duplicated chromosomes, does it contain any more genetic 
information than the cell before the chromosomes were duplicated? 
•  What is the significance of the fact that chromosomes condense before they are 
moved? 
•  How are the chromosome copies, called sister chromatids, separated from each 
other? 
•  What would happen if the sister chromatids failed to separate? 
■ Part 2: Effects of Environment on Mitosis 
Scientists reported that a fungal pathogen, may negatively affect the growth of soybeans 
(Glycine max). Soybean growth decreased during three years of high rainfall, and the 
soybean roots were poorly developed. Close relatives of R. anaerobis are plant pathogens 
and gro
