than Se 12.5 vs 2.42, we predict that H2SO4 is more acidic than 
H2SeO4.
For acids with the same central atom, the acidity 
increases as the number of oxygen atoms bonded to the 
central atom increases. Thus, H2SeO4 should be a stronger 
acid than H2SeO3. We predict the order of increasing acidity 
to be H2SeO3 6 H2SeO4 6 H2SO4.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Arrange the following substances in order from weakest to 
strongest acid: HClO3, HOI, HBrO2, HClO2, HIO2.
(a) HIO2 6 HOI 6 HClO3 6 HBrO2 6 HClO2
(b) HOI 6 HIO2 6 HBrO2 6 HClO2 6 HClO3
(c) HBrO2 6 HIO2 6 HClO2 6 HOI 6 HClO3
(d) HClO3 6 HClO2 6 HBrO2 6 HIO2 6 HOI
(e) HOI 6 HClO2 6 HBrO2 6 HIO2 6 HClO3
 
▶Practice Exercise
In each pair, choose the compound that gives the more  
acidic (or less basic) solution: (a) HBr, HF; (b) PH3, H2S; 
(c) HNO2, HNO3; (d) H2SO3, H2SeO3.
Because the oxidation number of Y increases as the number of attached O atoms 
increases, this correlation can be stated in an equivalent way: In a series of oxyacids, th
