20 amino acids plus the stop codon. Because each amino
acid has a three-nucleotide codon, both are composed of 63 bases, so
(A) and (B) would be the same length. (C) is incorrect because the
mutation associated with sickle cell is a substitution; one nucleotide
replaces another, so the length of the molecule is the same. The cystic
fibrosis mutation involves an insertion—the addition of a nucleotide—
making it the longest molecule, with 64 nucleotide bases. (D) is
correct.

Linkage maps are based on recombination frequencies, which increase
the farther apart genes are on a chromosome. In other words, the
more oȇen a particular pair of alleles are passed on together (the
lower the recombination frequency), the closer the genetic loci of
those alleles are (the smaller the distance). Because recombination
frequency and distance are directly correlated, (A) is correct. (B)
suggests the opposite. (C) is too extreme. (D) is simply irrelevant.

A ΔG < 0 indicates the reactants have
