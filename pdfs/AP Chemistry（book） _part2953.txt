18.3  The figure shows the three lowest regions of Earth’s atmo-
sphere. (a) Name each and indicate the approximate eleva-
tions at which the boundaries occur. (b) In which region is 
ozone a pollutant? In which region does it filter UV solar 
radiation? (c) In which region is infrared radiation from 
Earth’s surface most strongly reflected back? (d) An aurora 
borealis is due to excitation of atoms and molecules in 
the atmosphere 55–95 km above Earth’s surface. Which 
regions in the figure are involved in an aurora borealis? 
 
(e) Compare the changes in relative concentrations of 
water vapor and carbon dioxide with increasing elevation 
in these three regions [Section 18.1].
