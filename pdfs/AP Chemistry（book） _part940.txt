Each box represents
one orbital.
Each row represents
one shell.
Each cluster of boxes
represents one subshell.
n = 1 shell has one orbital
n = 2 shell has two subshells composed of four orbitals
n = 3 shell has three subshells composed of nine orbitals
â–² Figure 6.18 Energy levels in the hydrogen atom.
Are the energies of the n = 1, 2, and 3 shells shown here 
the same as or different from those of the Bohr model of 
the atom shown in Figure 6.12?
(a) Without referring to Table 6.2, predict the number of subshells in the fourth shell, that is, for n = 4. (b) Give the label for each 
of these subshells. (c) How many orbitals are in each of these subshells?
