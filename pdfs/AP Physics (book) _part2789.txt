A diverging lens, because it causes parallel rays to diverge, allows the rays to be
focused at the retina (Figs. 25–11a and b) and thus can correct nearsightedness.
In farsightedness, or hyperopia, the eye cannot focus on nearby objects.
Although distant objects are usually seen clearly, the near point is somewhat greater
than the “normal” 25 cm, which makes reading difficult. This defect is caused by an
eyeball that is too short or (less often) by a cornea that is not sufficiently curved. It
is corrected by a converging lens, Figs. 25–11c and d. Similar to hyperopia is
presbyopia, which is the lessening ability of the eye to accommodate as a person
ages, and the near point moves out. Converging lenses also compensate for this.
Astigmatism is usually caused by an out-of-round cornea or lens so that point
objects are focused as short lines, which blurs the image. It is as if the cornea were
spherical with a cylindrical section superimposed. As shown in Fig. 25–12, a cyl
