▶Practice Exercise 2
Calculate the velocity of a neutron whose de Broglie wave-
length is 505 pm. The mass of a  
neutron is given in the table 
inside the back cover of the text.

Using the value of the Planck constant:
h = 6.626 * 10 - 34 J@s
we have the following:
 
l =
h
mv
 
 =
16.626 * 10 - 34 J@s2

A baseball pitcher throws a fastball that moves at 95 miles per hour. Does that 
moving baseball generate matter waves? If so, can we observe them?
