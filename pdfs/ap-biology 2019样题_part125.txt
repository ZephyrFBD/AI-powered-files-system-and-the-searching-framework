Preparing for the AP Exam 
6.E.b
For the AP Exam, students must have a deep 
understanding of the significance of the 
steps in cell signaling, the amplification of 
the signal, the recycling of relay molecules 
between activated and inactivated forms 
to regulate the cellular response, and the 
multiple roles of the same molecules in 
providing specificity. Using the principles 
of cell signaling, students should be able 
to explain—using claim, evidence, and 
reasoning—how a drug works or how 
the symptoms of a chronic disease arise. 
Students should understand that signal 
molecules bind to receptors and that 
gene expression can be stimulated by 
signal transduction.
Students build on their abilities to describe 
and explain biological concepts and 
processes by describing the cell cycle
