of kinetic theory, which is based on the laws of classical mechanics. But to apply
Newtonâ€™s laws to each one of the vast number of molecules in a gas (
at
STP) is far beyond the capability of any present computer. Instead we take a sta-
tistical approach and determine averages of certain quantities, and connect these
averages to macroscopic variables. We will demand that our microscopic description
correspond to the macroscopic properties of gases; otherwise our theory would be
of little value. Most importantly, we will arrive at an important relation between
the average kinetic energy of molecules in a gas and the absolute temperature.
We make the following assumptions about the molecules in a gas. These
assumptions reflect a simple view of a gas, but nonetheless the results they predict
correspond well to the essential features of real gases that are at low pressure 
and are far from the liquefaction point. Under these conditions real gases follow the
ideal gas law quite
