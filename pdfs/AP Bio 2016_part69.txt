28. Steroid hormones, such as testosterone, pass through the
plasma membrane and bind to an intracellular protein, as
shown in the diagram below. The hormone-receptor complex
then enters the nucleus, where it interacts with DNA to
promote transcription of a specific gene.
Based on the information presented, which of the following 
will also occur in response to steroid signaling? 
(A) Histone protein synthesis will increase because histones 
maintain the DNA in an optimal conformation for 
chromosome assembly. 
(B) Ribosome production will increase because ribosomes 
are specific for the mRNA with which they bind during 
translation. 
(C) DNA replication will increase as a result of the binding 
of the hormone-receptor complex to the DNA. 
(D) Production of a specific mRNA will increase as a result 
of the binding of the hormone-receptor complex to
