ovement of ions across the membrane.
ENE-2.G.2
Membrane proteins are necessary for 
active transport.
ENE-2.G.3
Metabolic energy (such as from ATP) is 
required for active transport of molecules and/
or ions across the membrane and to establish 
and maintain concentration gradients.
ENE-2.G.4
The Na+/K+ ATPase contributes to the 
maintenance of the membrane potential.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING

Cells have membranes that allow them to establish and maintain internal 
environments that are different from their external environments.
