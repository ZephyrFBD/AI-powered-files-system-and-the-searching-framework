Wonderpedia:
Every second, 11 million sensations crackle along these [brain] pathways ... The brain is
confronted with an alarming array of images, sounds and smells which it rigorously filters
down until it is left with a manageable list of around 40. Thus 40 sensations per second make
up what we perceive as reality.
The ‘world’ is not what people are told to believe that is it and the
inner circles of the Cult know that.
Illusory ‘physical’ reality
We can only see a smear of 0.005 percent of the Universe which is
only one of a vast array of universes – ‘mansions’ – within inﬁnite
reality. Even then the brain decodes only 40 pieces of information
(‘sensations’) from a potential 11 million that we receive every
second. Two points strike you from this immediately: The sheer
breathtaking stupidity of believing we know anything so rigidly that
there’s nothing more to know; and the potential for these processes
