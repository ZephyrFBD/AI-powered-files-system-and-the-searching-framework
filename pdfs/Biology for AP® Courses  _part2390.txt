sted in a career in virology, find a mentor in the field. Many large medical
centers have departments of virology, and smaller hospitals usually have virology labs within their
microbiology departments. Volunteer in a virology lab for a semester or work in one over the summer.
Discussing the profession and getting a first-hand look at the work will help you decide whether a career in
virology is right for you. The American Society of Virologyâ€™s website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/asv) is
a good resource for information regarding training and careers in virology.
