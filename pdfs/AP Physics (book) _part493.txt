whether in Alaska, Peru, or 
Australia, the force of gravity acts
downward toward the Earth’s center.

FIGURE 5;18 Schematic diagram of
Cavendish’s apparatus. Two spheres
are attached to a light horizontal rod,
which is suspended at its center by a
thin fiber. When a third sphere
(labeled A) is brought close to one of
the suspended spheres (labeled B),
the gravitational force causes the 
latter to move, and this twists the 
fiber slightly. The tiny movement is 
magnified by the use of a narrow light
beam directed at a mirror mounted on
the fiber. The beam reflects onto a 
scale. Previous determination of how
large a force will twist the fiber a 
given amount then allows the 
experimenter to determine the 
magnitude of the gravitational force
between the two objects, A and B.
Newton went a step further in his analysis of gravity. In his examination of the
orbits of
