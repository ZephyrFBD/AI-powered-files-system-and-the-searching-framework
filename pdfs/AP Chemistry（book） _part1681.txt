ate the pressure exerted by 1.00 mol Cl2 
confined to a smaller volume, 5.00 L, at 25 °C. (a) First use 
the ideal-gas equation and (b) then use the van der Waals 
equation for your calculation. (Values for the van der Waals 
constants are given in Table 10.3.) (c) Why is the difference 
between the result for an ideal gas and that calculated us-
ing the van der Waals equation greater when the gas is con-
fined to 5.00 L compared to 22.4 L?

Calculate the pressure that CCl4 will exert at 80 °C if 
 
1.00 mol occupies 33.3 L, assuming that (a) CCl4 obeys the 
ideal-gas equation; (b) CCl4 obeys the van der Waals equa-
tion. (Values for the van der Waals constants are given in 
 
Table 10.3.) (c) Which would you expect to deviate more 
from ideal behavior under these conditions, Cl2 or CCl4? 
Explain.

Table 10.3 shows that the van der Waals b parameter has 
units of L/mol. This implies that we can calculate the size of 
atoms or molecules from b. Using the value of b
