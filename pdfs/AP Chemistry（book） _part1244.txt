▶Practice Exercise 2
Predict the charges on the ions formed when magnesium  
reacts with nitrogen.
SOLUTION
Analyze We must decide how many electrons are most likely to be 
gained or lost by atoms of Sr, S, and Al.
Plan In each case, we can use the element’s position in the peri-
odic table to predict whether the element forms a cation or an an-
ion. We can then use its electron configuration to determine the 
most likely ion formed.
Solve
(a) Strontium is a metal in group 2A and therefore forms a  
cation. Its electron configuration is 3Kr45s2, and so we  
expect that the two valence electrons will be lost to give 
an Sr2+  ion.
(b) Sulfur is a nonmetal in group 6A and will thus tend to be 
found as an anion. Its electron configuration 13Ne43s23p42  
is two electrons short of a noble-gas configuration. Thus, we  
expect that sulfur will form S2 -  ions.
(c) Aluminum is a metal in group 3A. We therefore expect it to 
form Al3 +  ions.
Check The ionic charges we predict here are con
