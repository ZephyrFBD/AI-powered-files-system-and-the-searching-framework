te occurs, causing the cell to actually promote
the expression of pro-apoptotic factors. Thus, (B) is correct. (A) is
incorrect because the upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins would
not be a result of an inhibitory response. (C) and (D) are incorrect
because the question stem does not indicate how the toxin inhibits
DNA repair. Increasing the concentration of DNA repair proteins would
only be useful if the toxin were a competitive inhibitor.

Inhibitory responses to signal transduction involve inhibitors that can
block signals from one molecule to another or lower enzyme activity,
while stimulatory responses usually involve activators or growth
factors that increase gene expression, cell growth, or cell proliferation.
Many processes can trigger both stimulatory and inhibitory responses.
For example, epinephrine activates glycogen breakdown while
simultaneously inhibiting the enzyme that catalyses glycogen
synthesis. By increasing the production of a prot
