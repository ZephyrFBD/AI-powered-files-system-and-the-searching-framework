 Pollutants in Lake Washington forced the 
sticklebacks to increase their mutation rate. 
(B) The rapid change in the Lake Washington 
ecosystem required individual sticklebacks 
to evolve complete armor quickly. 
(C) The increase in visibility in Lake Washington 
allowed sticklebacks to visually select 
mates with low armor. 
(D) New selective pressures favored individuals 
with the plated phenotype, causing the 
plated allele frequency in the population to 
quickly increase.

20. The phylogenetic trees in Figures 2 and 3 depict 
two different phylogenies of the same populations 
of sticklebacks. Which of the following questions 
will best help determine which tree represents the 
most accurate phylogeny? 
(A) Is the EDA gene as representative of the 
differences between the populations as the 
25 random genes that were examined for 
Figure 3 ? 
(B) Are the low-plated populatio
