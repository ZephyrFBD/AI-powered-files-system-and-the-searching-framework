ospheric pressure. (a) Is the 
detonation a reversible process? (b) What is the sign of q

Entropy and the Second Law of 
Thermodynamics (Section 19.2)
 19.21  Indicate whether each statement is true or false. (a) âˆ†S 
is a state function. (b) If a system undergoes a reversible 
change, the entropy of the universe increases. (c) If a sys-
tem undergoes a reversible process, the change in entropy 
of the system is exactly matched by an equal and opposite 
change in the entropy of the surroundings. (d) If a system 
undergoes a reversible process, the entropy change of the 
system must be zero.
 19.22  Indicate whether each statement is true or false. (a) The 
entropy of the universe increases for any spontaneous 
process. (b) The entropy change of the system is equal 
and opposite that of the surroundings for any irrevers-
ible process. (c) The entropy of the system must increase 
in any spontaneous process. (d) The
