ion is the same as that of pure water.
 5.56 (a) When a 4.25-g sample of solid ammonium nitrate dis-
solves in 60.0 g of water in a coffee-cup calorimeter (Figure 
5.18), the temperature drops from 22.0 to 16.9 °C. Calculate 
∆H (in kJ>mol NH4NO3) for the solution process:
 
 
NH4NO31s2 ¡  NH4
+1aq2 + NO3
-1aq2
 
 Assume that the specific heat of the solution is the same 
as that of pure water. (b) Is this process endothermic or 
exothermic?
 5.57 A 2.200-g sample of quinone 1C6H4O22 is burned in a bomb 
calorimeter whose total heat capacity is 7.854 kJ>°C. The tem-
perature of the calorimeter increases from 23.44 to 30.57 °C. 
What is the heat of combustion per gram of quinone? Per 
mole of quinone?
 5.58 A 1.800-g sample of phenol 1C6H5OH2 was burned in a bomb 
calorimeter whose total heat capacity is 11.66 kJ>°C. The 
temperature of the calorimeter plus contents increased 
from 21.36 to 26.37 °C. (a) Write a balanced chemical 
equation for the bomb calorimeter reaction. (b) What is
