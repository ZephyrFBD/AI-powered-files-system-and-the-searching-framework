Deriving the Half-Life Formula
We can derive Eq. 30–6 starting from Eq. 30–4 by setting
at 
so
and
We take natural logs of both sides (“ln” and “e” are inverse operations, meaning
) and find
so
and
which is Eq. 30–6.
Mean Life
Sometimes the mean life
of an isotope is quoted, which is defined as
Then Eq. 30–4 can be written 
just as for RC and LR circuits
(Chapters 19 and 21 where 
was called the time constant). The mean life of an
isotope is then given by (see also Eq. 30–6)
[mean life] (30;7)
The mean life and half-life differ by a factor of 0.693, so confusing them can cause
serious error (and has). The radioactive decay law, Eq. 30–5, can then be written
as R = R0e–tt.
