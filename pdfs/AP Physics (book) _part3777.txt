ther
of ordinary matter, which is not visible, is mainly gaseous plasma.
It is remarkable that only 0.5% of all the mass–energy in the universe is visible as
stars and galaxies.
The idea that the universe is dominated by completely unknown forms of
matter and energy seems bizarre. Nonetheless, the ability of our present model
to precisely explain observations of the CMB anisotropy, cosmic expansion, and
large-scale structure (next Section) presents a compelling case.
33–10 Large-Scale Structure of the
Universe
The beautiful WMAP pictures of the sky (Fig. 33–26) show small but significant
inhomogeneities in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
These anisotropies reflect compressions and expansions in the primordial plasma
just before decoupling (Fig. 33–29), from which galaxies and clusters of galaxies
formed. Analyses of the irregularities in the CMB using mammoth computer
