ates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.
These macromolecules play a role in cell structure and carry out
functions necessary for the survival and growth of living organisms. For
instance, the breakdown of macromolecules provides energy for cellular
activities.
Carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids are examples of polymers
that are built from smaller molecular units, or monomers, connected by
covalent bonds. Lipids are not considered polymers because they are not
composed of monomers. While some lipids are made up of smaller
molecules like fatty acids, those subunits are not directly bonded to one
another as in proper polymers.
Cells assemble polymers via a process called dehydration synthesis
(condensation), in which energy is consumed to form a covalent bond
and release water. During dehydration synthesis, either two hydrogen
atoms from one monomer and an oxygen atom from another monomer
are combined, or a hydrogen atom from one monomer and a hydroxyl
(OH) group from another m
