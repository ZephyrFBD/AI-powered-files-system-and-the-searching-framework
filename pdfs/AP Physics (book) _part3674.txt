are stars in a galaxy. See Fig. 33–5.
Many galaxies tend to be grouped in galaxy clusters held together by their
mutual gravitational attraction. There may be anywhere from a few dozen to
many thousands of galaxies in each cluster. Furthermore, clusters themselves
seem to be organized into even larger aggregates: clusters of clusters of galaxies,
or superclusters. The farthest detectable galaxies are more than 
distant.

refers to the diameter of the curved objective mirror. The bigger the mirror, the
more light it collects (greater brightness) and the less diffraction there is (better resolution), so more and
fainter stars can be seen. See Chapter 25. Until recently, photographic films or plates were used to take
long time exposures. Now large solid-state CCD or CMOS sensors (Section 25–1) are available con-
taining hundreds of millions of pixels (compared to 10 million pixels in a good-quality
