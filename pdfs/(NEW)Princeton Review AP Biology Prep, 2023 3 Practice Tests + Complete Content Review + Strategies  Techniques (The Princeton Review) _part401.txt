uctively isolated from each other. This would then allow the two groups to undergo natural selection and
evolve differently. With different variation and different environmental pressures, they could each change in
different ways and no longer be able to mate. This is called divergent evolution. Divergent evolution that occurs
quickly after a period of stasis (little evolution) is called punctuated equilibrium. This is often due to a major
event. A change that comes about after many smaller changes is called gradualism and it takes hundreds or millions
of years. You should also be aware of adaptive radiation, which occurs when a species rapidly diversifies due to an
abundance of available ecological niches suddenly opening up.
What Is a Species?
To be considered the same species, two individuals must be able to mate and
produce viable offspring that would then be capable of mating and producing
offspring.
Divergent evolution results in closely related species with different behaviors a
