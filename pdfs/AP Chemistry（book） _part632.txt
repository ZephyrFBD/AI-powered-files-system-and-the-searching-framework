s; they increase the concen-
tration of OH-1aq2 in aqueous solutions. Those acids and bases that 
are strong electrolytes are called strong acids and strong bases, respec-
tively. Those that are weak electrolytes are weak acids and weak bases. 
When solutions of acids and bases are mixed, a neutralization reac-
tion occurs. The neutralization reaction between an acid and a metal 
hydroxide produces water and a salt. Gases can also be formed as a 
result of neutralization reactions. The reaction of a sulfide with an 
acid forms H2S1g); the reaction between a carbonate and an acid 
forms CO21g2.
OXIDATION-REDUCTION REACTIONS (SECTION 4.4) Oxidation is 
the loss of electrons by a substance, whereas reduction is the gain of 
electrons by a substance. Oxidation numbers keep track of electrons 
during chemical reactions and are assigned to atoms using specific 
 
Ag3PO4 will precipitate from the solution. In contrast, K+ 
and NO3
- will remain in solution because KNO3 is water 
soluble. Thus
