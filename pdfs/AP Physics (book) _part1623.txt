o R. J. E. Clausius (1822–1888), is that
heat can flow spontaneously from a hot object to a cold object; heat will not
flow spontaneously from a cold object to a hot object.
Since this statement applies to one particular process, it is not obvious how it
applies to other processes. A more general statement is needed that will include
other possible processes in a more obvious way.
The development of a general statement of the second law of thermodynamics
was based partly on the study of heat engines. A heat engine is any device that
changes thermal energy into mechanical work, such as a steam engine or an auto-
mobile engine. We now examine heat engines, both from a practical point of view
and to show their importance in developing the second law of thermodynamics.

It is easy to produce thermal energy by doing work—for example, by simply rub-
bing your hands together briskly, or indeed by any frictional process. But to get
work from thermal energy is more difficult, a
