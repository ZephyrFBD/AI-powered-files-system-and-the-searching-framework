 correspond to: ul-
traviolet, visible, or infrared?
 12.79  GaAs and GaP make solid solutions that have the same 
crystal structure as the parent materials, with As and P ran-
domly distributed throughout the crystal. GaPxAs1 - x exists 
for any value of x. If we assume that the band gap varies lin-
early with composition between x = 0 and x = 1, estimate 
the band gap for GaP0.5As0.5. (GaAs and GaP band gaps are 
1.43 eV and 2.26 eV, respectively.) What wavelength of light 
does this correspond to?
 12.80  Red light-emitting diodes are made from GaAs and GaP 
solid solutions, GaPxAs1 - x (see Exercise 12.79). The original 
red LEDs emitted light with a wavelength of 660 nm. If we 
assume that the band gap varies linearly with composition 
between x = 0 and x = 1, estimate the composition (the 
value of x) that is used in these LEDs.

be used as a monomer: ethanol, ethene (also called eth-
