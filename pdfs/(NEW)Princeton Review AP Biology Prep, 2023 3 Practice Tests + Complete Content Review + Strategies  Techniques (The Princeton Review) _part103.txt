Concept Explanation
1. Electrophoresis is used to separate DNA fragments by their size and charge. DNA fragments are pipetted into
an agarose gel well and covered with a buffer. An electrical current is applied to the gel and buffered solution.
Which of the following best explains why DNA fragments migrate towards the positive pole through the
agarose gel?
(A) The nitrogenous bases found in DNA have a positive charge.
(B) The phosphate groups found in DNA have a negative charge.
(C) The histone proteins which are intertwined with the DNA have a negative charge.
(D) The polar bonds on the deoxyribose molecules found in DNA have a slightly negative charge.
Concept Explanation questions require you to explain biological concepts, processes, and written models. These are
your standard content knowledge questions, where you may be asked to apply prior knowledge to a specific context
or situation. T
