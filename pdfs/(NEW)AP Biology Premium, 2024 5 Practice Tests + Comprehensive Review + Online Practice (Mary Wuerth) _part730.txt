ge in the
environment that provided a selective advantage to flies with a black body. Choices (A) and (C) are incorrect
because the frequency of the recessive phenotype increased between years 6 and 7, not decreased. Individuals
do not evolve; populations evolve. So choice (D) is incorrect.
7. (D) Founder effect occurs when members of a population migrate to a new area and the frequency of one or
more alleles in the migrating/founding population is higher than in the original population. Choice (A) is
incorrect because there is no evidence that methemoglobinemia has a selective advantage, nor is there evidence
that heterozygotes for the trait have a selective advantage, so choice (B) is also incorrect. The bottleneck effect
occurs when a population undergoes a rapid and extreme decrease in population size, which is not the case in
this example, so choice (C) is incorrect.
8. (B) Species M has all five traits, so it is on the far right of the cladogram. Species L has traits 1, 2, 3, and
