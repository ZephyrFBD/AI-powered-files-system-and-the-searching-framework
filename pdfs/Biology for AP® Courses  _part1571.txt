why radioactive sulfur and phosphorous were
used to label bacteriophages in the Hershey and Chase
experiments.
a.
Protein was labeled with radioactive sulfur and
DNA was labeled with radioactive phosphorous.
Phosphorous is found in DNA, so it will be
tagged by radioactive phosphorous.
b.
Protein was labeled with radioactive
phosphorous and DNA was labeled with
radioactive sulfur. Phosphorous is found in
DNA, so it will be tagged by radioactive
phosphorous.
c.
Protein was labeled with radioactive sulfur and
DNA was labeled with radioactive phosphorous.
Phosphorous is found in DNA, so DNA will be
tagged by radioactive sulfur.
d.
Protein was labeled with radioactive sulfur and
DNA was labeled with radioactive phosphorous.
Phosphorous is found in DNA, so DNA will be
tagged by radioactive sulfur.
36. How can Chargaffâ€™s rules be used to identify different
species?
a.
The amount of adenine, thymine, guanine, and
cytosine varies from species to species and are
not found in equal quantities. Th
