Calculate the concentration of Ag+ present in solution at equilibrium when concentrated ammonia is added to a 0.010 M solution 
of AgNO3 to give an equilibrium concentration of 3NH34 = 0.20 M. Neglect the small volume change that occurs when NH3 is 
added.

Evaluating an Equilibrium Involving a Complex Ion
SOLUTION
Analyze Addition of NH31aq2 to Ag+1aq2 forms Ag1NH322
+1aq2, as 
shown in Equation 17.22. We are asked to determine what  
concentration of Ag+1aq2 remains uncombined when the NH3 
concentration is brought to 0.20 M in a solution originally  
0.010 M in AgNO3.
Plan We assume that the AgNO3 is completely dissociated, giv-
ing 0.010 M Ag+. Because Kf for the formation of Ag1NH322
+ is 
quite large, we assume that essentially all the Ag+ is conver
