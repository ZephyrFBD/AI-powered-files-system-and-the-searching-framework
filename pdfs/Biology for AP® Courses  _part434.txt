The Nucleolus
We already know that the nucleus directs the synthesis of ribosomes, but how does it do this? Some chromosomes have
sections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA. A darkly staining area within the nucleus called the nucleolus (plural
= nucleoli) aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that are then
transported out through the pores in the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm.
Ribosomes
Ribosomes are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. When viewed through an electron microscope,
ribosomes appear either as clusters (polyribosomes) or single, tiny dots that float freely in the cytoplasm. They may be
attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum and the
outer membrane of the nuclear envelope (Figure 4.8). Electron microscopy has shown us that ribosomes, which are large
complexes of protein and RNA, consist of two subunits, aptly called
