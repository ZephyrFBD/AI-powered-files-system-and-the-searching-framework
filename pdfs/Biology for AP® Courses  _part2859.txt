 feedback loop as the stimulus (red blood cell release) has changed direction
in response to a signal (presence of enough red blood cells).
d.
a. This is regulated by a negative feedback loop as the stimulus (hunger) changed direction in response to a
signal (fullness).
b. This is regulated by a negative feedback loop as the stimulus (red blood cell release) changed direction in
response to a signal (presence of enough red blood cells).
Set Point
It is possible to adjust a systemâ€™s set point. When this happens, the feedback loop works to maintain the new setting. An
example of this is blood pressure: over time, the normal or set point for blood pressure can increase as a result of continued
increases in blood pressure. The body no longer recognizes the elevation as abnormal and no attempt is made to return to
the lower set point. The result is the maintenance of an elevated blood pressure that can have harmful effects on the body.
Medication can lower blood pressure and lower the set p
