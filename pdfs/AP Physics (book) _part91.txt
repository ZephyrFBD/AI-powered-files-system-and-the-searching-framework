Base vs. Derived Quantities
Physical quantities can be divided into two categories: base quantities and
derived quantities. The corresponding units for these quantities are called base
units and derived units. A base quantity must be defined in terms of a standard.
Scientists, in the interest of simplicity, want the smallest number of base quanti-
ties possible consistent with a full description of the physical world. This
number turns out to be seven, and those used in the SI are given in Table 1–5.
