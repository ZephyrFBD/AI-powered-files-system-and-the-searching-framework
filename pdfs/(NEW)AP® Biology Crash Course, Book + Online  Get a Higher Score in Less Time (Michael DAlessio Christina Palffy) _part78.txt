gle character. Apply the Law of
Segregation. Example: In pea plants, tall (T) plants are dominant to short plants (t). There are three
allelic combinations:
TT—homozygous dominant (true breeding)/Tall
Tt—heterozygous or hybrid/Tall
Tt—homozygous recessive (true breeding)/Short
Cross two true breeding plants of tall and short
Note: Punnett squares can be used to determine the genotypes and phenotypes of progeny
from a genetic cross. Monohybrid or multi-hybrid crosses can be used.
2. Test cross—A cross that determines whether the dominant parent is homozygous dominant or
heterozygous. Always cross the dominant parent to a homozygous recessive. Assume black (B) is
dominant to white (b) for cat coat color.
Black parent could be BB or Bb. White parent is bb.
If BB x bb, all progeny will be black carriers.
If Bb x bb, ½ of the progeny are black and ½ are white.
3. Dihybrid cross—a cross between two different characteristics; demonstrates Law of Independent
Assortment.
Example: In pea plants,
