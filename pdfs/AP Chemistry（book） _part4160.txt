elements and water is 
a compound. page 12 Density is an intensive property. Because 
it is measured per unit of volume, it is independent of how much 
of the material is present. page 13 (a) Chemical change: Carbon 
dioxide and water are different compounds than sugar. (b) Physical 
change: Water in the gas phase becomes water in the solid phase 
(frost). (c) Physical change: Gold in the solid state becomes liquid 
and then resolidifies. page 15 Doubling its speed will increase the 
kinetic energy by a factor of four, while doubling its mass will only 
double the kinetic energy. page 16 The chemical potential energy 
of the battery decreases as it is discharged. page 17 The candela, 
cd. page 19 103 page 21  2.5 * 102 m3 is, because it has units of 
length to the third power. page 24 (b) Mass of a penny page 25 
The mass should be reported to ﬁve signiﬁcant ﬁgures, two ﬁgures 
to the left of the decimal point and three to the right. page 27 The 
mass of the water can be reported as 5.
