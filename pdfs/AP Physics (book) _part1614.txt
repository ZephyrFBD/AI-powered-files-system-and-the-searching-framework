what is the change in internal energy of the gas during process BD?
8.4 * 103 J,
Work done in an engine. In an engine, 0.25 mol of an 
ideal monatomic gas in the cylinder expands rapidly and adiabatically against
the piston. In the process, the temperature of the gas drops from 1150 K to 400 K.
How much work does the gas do?
APPROACH We take the gas as our system (the piston is part of the surround-
ings). The
