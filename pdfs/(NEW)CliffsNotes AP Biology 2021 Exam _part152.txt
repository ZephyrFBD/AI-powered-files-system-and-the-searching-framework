otosynthesis
Review
Like cellular respiration, photosynthesis requires that you apply your knowledge of chemistry. Again, you will need
to know the names of important molecules, describe their sequence in metabolic processes, and describe how the
processes accomplish their metabolic objectives.
Photosynthesis is the process of capturing free energy in sunlight and storing that energy in chemical bonds,
especially glucose. The general chemical equation describing photosynthesis is
6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light â†’ C6H12O6 + 6 O2
Note that this equation for photosynthesis is the reverse of the equation for cellular respiration, except that the
energy required by photosynthesis comes from light. The processes are interconnected: Energy stored in chemical
bonds by photosynthesis is extracted from those bonds by respiration to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The
energy in ATP is then used to do cellular work through metabolic processes.
The process of photosynthesis begins with light-absorbing pig
