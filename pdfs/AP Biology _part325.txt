result of this processing, the mRNA that leaves the nucleus is a

great deal shorter than the original transcription unit. If the average
length of a human DNA molecule that is transcribed is about
27,000 nucleotides long, the primary transcript is also the same
length. However, an average-size protein of 200 amino acids
requires only 1,200 nucleotides of RNA to code for it. Therefore,
out of the original 27,000 nucleotides, 15,800 noncoding
nucleotides must be removed or spliced out during RNA
processing. See Figure 9.5.

Before the human genome was sequenced by the Human Genome Project,
scientists expected that they would find about 100,000 genes. In fact, they
discovered that humans have only about 22,000 genes. This surprised
everyone but can be explained when you recognize the me
