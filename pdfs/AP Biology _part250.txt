because a stronger proton
gradient will be established across the thylakoid membrane.
ATP production will increase because the Calvin cycle will be
unable to produce ATP.
Answers Explained
(C) If light is absorbed, it is not reflected. Only reflected colors are
visible. The graph shows that red and violet are most absorbed and
that green is most reflected. Therefore, the color of the pigment is
green. (ENE-1)
(A) Electrons undergoing cyclic photophosphorylation move from
P680 to P700 and then cycle back to P680. The sole purpose of
cyclic photophosphorylation is the production of ATP. No NADPH
is produced, and no oxygen is released. This process is necessary
when the cell needs more ATP because ATP has been used up by
the Calvin cycle. Sugar is produced during the light-independent
reactions only, not during the light-dependent ones. (ENE-1)
