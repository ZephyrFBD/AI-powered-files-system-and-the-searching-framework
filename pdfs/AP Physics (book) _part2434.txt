ion, cell phones,
wi-fi, Bluetooth, and all wireless
communication. These devices work by
electromagnetic waves traveling 
through space. Wireless devices are 
applications of Marconi’s development 
of long-distance transmission of 
information a century ago.
In this photo we see the first 
humans to land on the Moon. In the
background is a television camera 
that sent live moving images through
empty space to Earth where it was
shown live.
We will see in this Chapter that
Maxwell predicted the existence of 
EM waves from his famous 
equations. Maxwell’s equations
themselves are a magnificent summary
of electromagnetism. We will also 
see that EM waves carry energy
and momentum, and that light itself 
is an electromagnetic wave.

Magnetic Fields; Maxwell’s Equations
The development of electromagnetic theory in the early part of the nineteenth
century by Oersted, Ampère, and others was not actually done in terms o
