ections 14–3 and 14–4) to determine the heat
transferred. Then we use the average temperature of each sample of water to
estimate the entropy change (¢QT).
EXAMPLE 15;14
ESTIMATE
The temperature in Example 15–13 was constant, so the calculation was short.
If the temperature varies during a process, a summation of the heat flow over the
changing temperature can often be calculated using calculus or a computer. How-
ever, if the temperature change is not too great, a reasonable approximation can be
made using the average value of the temperature, as indicated in the next Example.
SOLUTION A quantity of heat,
flows out of the hot water as it cools down from 24°C to 22°C, and this heat flows
into the cold water as it warms from 20°C to 22°C. The total change in entropy,
will be the sum of the changes in entropy of the hot water,
and that 
of the cold water,
We estimate entropy changes by writing
where 
is an “average”
temperature for each process, which ought to give a reasonable estimate
