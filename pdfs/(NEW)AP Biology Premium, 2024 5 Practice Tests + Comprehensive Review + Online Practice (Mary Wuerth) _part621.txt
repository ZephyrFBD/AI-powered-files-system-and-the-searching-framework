25Â°C from 10 minutes to 20 minutes 
.
Choice (B) is incorrect because it is the overall rate of oxygen consumption over the 25-minute period. Choice
(C) is the cumulative oxygen consumption at 20 minutes, so it is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because it is
the cumulative oxygen consumption at 25 minutes.
4. (C) The following table summarizes some of the major differences between mitosis and meiosis:
Mitosis
Meiosis
Produces genetically identical cells
Produces genetically different cells
Produces diploid cells
Produces haploid cells
Forms somatic (body) cells
Forms gametes
Choices (A) and (B) are incorrect because mitosis produces diploid (not haploid) cells and meiosis produces
haploid (not diploid) cells. Choice (D) is incorrect because mitosis produces genetically identical (not different)
cells and meiosis produces genetically different (not identical) cells.
5. (D) Streptomycin will kill any bacteria that are not resistant to the antibiotic. Since Tube 2 did not contain the
