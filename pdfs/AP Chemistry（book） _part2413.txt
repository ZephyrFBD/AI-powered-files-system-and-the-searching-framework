Applications of Equilibrium 
Constants
We have seen that the magnitude of K indicates the extent to which a reaction proceeds.
t If K is very large, the equilibrium mixture contains mostly substances on the product 
side of the equation for the reaction.
 
Notice that the entries for the 
changes are negative when a reactant 
is consumed and positive when a 
product is formed.
