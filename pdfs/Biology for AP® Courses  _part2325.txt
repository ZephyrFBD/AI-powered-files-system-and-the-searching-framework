ghlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP速
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP速 exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.

3.1 The student is able to construct scientific explanations that use the structures and
mechanisms of DNA and RNA to support the claim that DNA and, in some cases, that RNA
are the primary so
