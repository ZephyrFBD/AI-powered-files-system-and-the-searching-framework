ollision is elastic, we have three independent equations and can solve for
three unknowns. If we are given 
(and 
if it is not zero), we can-
not, for example, predict the final variables,
and 
because there
are four of them. However, if we measure one of these variables, say 
then the
other three variables (
and 
) are uniquely determined, and we can
determine them using Eqs. 7–8a, b, c.
A note of caution: Eq. 7–7 (page 179) does not apply for two-dimensional
collisions. It works only when a collision occurs along a line.

in (a), but is translation plus rotation in (b). The black dot
represents the diver’s CM at each moment.

Momentum is a powerful concept not only for analyzing collisions but also for
analyzing the translational motion of real extended o
