2.8.2 Logarithmic Equations 
A logarithmic equation is one in which a logarithm of the variable occurs.  
Some logarithmic equations can be solved by using the fact that logarithmic functions are 
one-to-one. 
This means that

GUIDELINES FOR SOLVING LOGARITHMIC EQUATIONS 
1. Isolate the logarithmic term on one side of the equation; you might first need to 
combine the logarithmic terms. 
2. Write the equation in exponential form (or raise the base to each side of the 
equation). 
3. Solve for the variable. 
 
Example 3 
Solve each equation for x. 
(a) lnx = 8 
(b) log2 (25-x) =3
