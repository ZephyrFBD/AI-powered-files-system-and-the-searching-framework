and
water to be excreted in the urine. ANP also reduces the amounts of renin released by the kidneys and aldosterone released
by the adrenal cortex, further preventing the retention of water. In this way, ANP causes a reduction in blood volume and
blood pressure, and reduces the concentration of Na+ in the blood.
The gastrointestinal tract produces several hormones that aid in digestion. The endocrine cells are located in the mucosa
of the GI tract throughout the stomach and small intestine. Some of the hormones produced include gastrin, secretin, and
cholecystokinin, which are secreted in the presence of food, and some of which act on other organs such as the pancreas,
gallbladder, and liver. They trigger the release of gastric juices, which help to break down and digest food in the GI tract.
While the adrenal glands associated with the kidneys are major endocrine glands, the kidneys themselves also possess
endocrine function. Renin is released in response to decreased blood volume or
