establish the existence of electron spin. In this experiment, 
a beam of silver atoms is passed through a magnetic ﬁeld, 
which deﬂects half of the silver atoms in one direction and 
half in the opposite direction. The separation between the 
two beams increases as the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld 
increases. (a) What is the electron conﬁguration for a silver 
atom? (b) Would this experiment work for a beam of cad-
mium (Cd) atoms? (c) Would this experiment work for a 
beam of ﬂuorine (F) atoms?
 6.71  What is the maximum number of electrons that can occupy 
each of the following subshells? (a) 3p, (b) 5d, (c) 2s, (d) 4f.
 6.72  What is the maximum number of electrons in an 
atom that can have the following quantum numbers? 
(a) n = 3, ml = -2; (b) n = 4, l = 3; (c) n = 5, l = 3, ml = 2; 
(d) n = 4, l = 1, ml = 0.
 6.73  (a) What are “valence electrons”? (b) What are “core elec-
trons”? (c) What does each box in an orbital diagram rep-
resent? (d) What object is represented by the
