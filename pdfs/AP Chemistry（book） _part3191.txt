stream of hydrogen gas at 1 atm. The SHE can operate as either the anode or cathode of a 
cell, depending on the nature of the other electrode.
Figure 20.9 shows a voltaic cell using a SHE. The spontaneous reaction is the one 
shown in Figure 20.1, namely, oxidation of Zn and reduction of H+:
Zn1s2 + 2 H+1aq2 ¡ Zn2+1aq2 + H21g2
When the cell is operated under standard conditions, the cell potential is +0.76 V. By 
using the standard cell potential 1E°
