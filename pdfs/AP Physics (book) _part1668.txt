s from the average, or most probable, arrangement. In
ordinary systems we are not dealing with only 100 molecules, but with extremely
large numbers of molecules: in 1 mole alone there are 
molecules. Hence
the probability of deviation far from the average is incredibly tiny. For example, it
has been calculated that the probability that a stone resting on the ground could
transform 1 cal of thermal energy into mechanical energy and rise up into the air
is much less likely than the probability that a group of monkeys typing randomly
would by chance produce the complete works of Shakespeare. Put another way,
the probability is less than once in the entire age of the universe; this could be what
“never” means.
