from Mendel’s model of inheritance?
Connection for AP® Courses
The characteristics that Mendel evaluated in his pea plants were each expressed as one of two versions, or traits (e.g., green
peas versus yellow peas). As we will explore in more detail in later chapters, the physical expression of characteristics is
accomplished through the expression of genes (sequences of DNA), carried on chromosomes. The genetic makeup of peas
consists of two similar, or homologous (remember this term from Chapter 11), copies of each chromosome, one from each
parent. Through meiosis, diploid organisms utilize meiosis to produce haploid (1n) gametes that participate in fertilization.
For cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, such as pea color, a diploid organism has genetic copies
that may or may not encode the same version of the characteristic. These gene variations (e.g., green peas versus yellow
peas) are called alleles.
