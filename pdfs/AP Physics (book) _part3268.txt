almost no electrons
can acquire the 5 eV needed to reach the conduction band. When a potential
difference is applied across the material, no available states are accessible to the
electrons, and no current flows. Hence, the material is a good insulator.

Figure 29–25 compares the relevant energy bands (a) for conductors,
(b) for insulators, and also (c) for the important class of materials known as
semiconductors. The bands for a pure (or intrinsic) semiconductor, such as silicon
or germanium, are like those for an insulator, except that the unfilled conduction
band is separated from the filled valence band by a much smaller energy gap,
which for silicon is 
At room temperature, electrons are moving
about with varying amounts of kinetic energy

theory, Chapter 13. A few electrons can acquire enough thermal e
