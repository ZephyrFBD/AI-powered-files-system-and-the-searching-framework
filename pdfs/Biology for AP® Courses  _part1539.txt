so that it does not slide off the DNA. RNase H removes the RNA primer, which is then replaced
with DNA nucleotides. The Okazaki fragments in the lagging strand are joined together after the replacement of the RNA
primers with DNA. The gaps that remain are sealed by DNA ligase, which forms the phosphodiester bond.
Telomere Replication
Unlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear. As youâ€™ve learned, the enzyme DNA pol can add
nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is
reached. On the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. When
the replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no place for a primer to be made for the DNA
fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome. These ends thus remain unpaired, and over time these ends may get
progressively shorter as cells continue to divide.
The ends of the li
