f the air column. In
others, a stream of air is directed against one edge of the opening or mouthpiece,
leading to turbulence which sets up the vibrations. Because of the disturbance,
whatever its source, the air within the tube vibrates with a variety of frequencies,
but only frequencies that correspond to standing waves will persist.
For a string fixed at both ends, Fig. 12–7, the standing waves have nodes (no
movement) at the two ends, and one or more antinodes (large amplitude of vibration)
in between. A node separates successive antinodes. The lowest-frequency standing
wave, the fundamental, corresponds to a single antinode. The higher-frequency
standing waves are called overtones or harmonics, as we saw in Section 11–12.
Specifically, the first harmonic is the fundamental, the second harmonic
has twice the frequency of the fundamental, and so on.
