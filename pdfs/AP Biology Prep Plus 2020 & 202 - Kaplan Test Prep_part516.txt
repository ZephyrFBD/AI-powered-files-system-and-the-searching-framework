iet, thyroxine is not secreted by the
gland. Individuals whose diet is deficient in iodine may develop a
goiter, an enlarged thyroid gland.Â Which of the following
hypotheses best explains the formation of a goiter?
TSH is regulated by a negative feedback loop and keeps
stimulating the thyroid when thyroxine production is low.
(A)
Without enough iodine present, cells in the gland keep
dividing and the organ becomes enlarged.
(B)
Thyroxine precursors accumulate in the gland and begin to
form new compounds that cause it to become enlarged.
(C)
If the dietary content of iodine is too low, the gland enlarges
to maximize uptake from the bloodstream.
(D)
7. Following ingestion of a meal, an increase in blood glucose levels
stimulates insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. Insulin
activates glucose utilization and storage via positive feedback.
Decreased blood glucose levels, in turn, stop insulin secretion via
negative feedback.
Patients with type 2 diabetes have high glucose levels beca
