he two spheres shown here, one made of silver and 
the other of aluminum. (a) What is the mass of each sphere 
in kg? (b) The force of gravity acting on an object is F = mg, 
where m is the mass of an object and g is the acceleration of 
gravity (9.8 m/s2). How much work do you do on each sphere 
it you raise it from the floor to a height of 2.2 m? (c) Does the 
act of lifting the sphere off the ground increase the poten-
tial energy of the aluminum sphere by a larger, smaller, or 
 
same amount as the silver sphere? (d) If you release the 
spheres simultaneously, they will have the same velocity 
when they hit the ground. Will they have the same kinetic 
energy? If not, which sphere will have more kinetic energy?
