e genome makes it easier for researchers to study individual genes. Human genome maps help researchers in their
efforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis. Genome
mapping can be used in a variety of other applications, such as using live microbes to clean up pollutants or even prevent
pollution. Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to producing higher crop yields or developing plants that
better adapt to climate change.
Genetic Maps
The study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis, a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between
genes to determine if they are linked or show independent assortment. The term linkage was used before the discovery
of DNA. Early geneticists relied on the observation of phenotypic changes to understand the genotype of an organism.
Shortly after Gregor Mendel (the father of modern genetics) proposed that traits were determined by what are now known
as gen
