Phylogenetic trees always branch out from a common ancestor, so the
leȇmost branch represents the common ancestor of all birds. Because
it is the common ancestor, it represents the point at which birds first
evolved from other vertebrate ancestors (most likely reptiles, based on
fossil and molecular evidence to date). (C) is thus correct. (A) is
incorrect because the branch does not indicate relationships; the
structure of the tree itself is what indicates the relationships between
taxa. (B) is incorrect because unresolved and unknown species are not
featured on the tree. (D) is incorrect because this tree provides no
information about whether particular species are extinct.

(C) If all the organisms in a phylogenetic tree share a trait, the simplest
explanation is that the common ancestor also shared that trait. (A) has
this reasoning backward. (B) relies on the misunderstanding that the
only type of egg is a chicken egg. If (B) had read “the chicken and t
