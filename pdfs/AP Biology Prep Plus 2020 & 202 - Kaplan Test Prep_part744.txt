 humans and chimpanzees have the most
similarities in their GADPH genes and proteins. Therefore, humans and
chimpanzees would be placed closest together on our cladogram as
shown.
We can make deductions for the remaining three species based on their
similarity to humans. Roundworms’ GADPH genes have the least in
common with humans, so roundworms should be placed farthest from
humans on the cladogram. Dogs are closer to humans than fruit flies but
farther away than chimpanzees.

CHAPTER:
A phylogenetic tree is a diagram indicating evolutionary
relationships between taxa of organisms. It depicts an
ancestral species with other species branching oﬀ from it. More
closely related taxa are nearer to one another in the diagram.
Phylogenetic trees are intended to show ancestral connections
between species and some include information about the
timescale of species divergences.
