e force,
and we discuss how to treat it later in this Chapter (Section 6–9). Table 6–1 lists a
few conservative and nonconservative forces.
Because potential energy is energy associated with the position or configura-
tion of objects, potential energy can only make sense if it can be stated uniquely
for a given point. This cannot be done with nonconservative forces because the
work done depends on the path taken (as in Fig. 6–16). Hence, potential energy
can be defined only for a conservative force. Thus, although potential energy is
always associated with a force, not all forces have a potential energy. For example,
there is no potential energy for friction.

EXERCISE E An object acted on by a constant force F moves from point 1 to point 2
and back again. The work done by the force F in this round trip is 60 J. Can you deter-
mine from this information if F is a conservative or nonconservative force?
