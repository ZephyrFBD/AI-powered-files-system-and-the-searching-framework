surface, as shown in Fig. 10–2, then according to Newton’s third law the
solid surface would exert a force back on the fluid, which would cause the fluid to
flow—in contradiction to our assumption that the fluid is at rest. Thus the force
due to the pressure in a fluid at rest is always perpendicular to the surface.
