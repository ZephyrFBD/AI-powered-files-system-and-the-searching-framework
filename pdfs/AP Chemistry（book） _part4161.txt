5 g with a total of two signiﬁ-
cant ﬁgures. The number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures to the right of the 
decimal point is limited by the precision to which the mass of the 
empty beaker is known. page 30 Conversions (i) and (ii) involve 
exact numbers and therefore do not alter the number of signiﬁcant 
ﬁgures in a calculation, but conversion (iii) has the potential to affect 
the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in a calculation.

page 45 (a) The law of multiple proportions. (b) The second com-
pound must contain two oxygen atoms for each carbon atom (that 
is, twice as many carbon atoms as the first compound). page 47  
(b) The particles that make up cathode rays must be present in all 
metals. page 49 As the thickness of the gold foil increases there is a 
higher probability that the alpha particle will collide with a nucleus 
as it passes through the foil, increasing the number of alpha particles 
scattered at large angles. page 50 (a) The atom has 15 electrons 
because atoms have equ
