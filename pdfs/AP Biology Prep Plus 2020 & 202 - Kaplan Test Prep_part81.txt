s has nothing to
do with these organisms meeting their energy needs through diﬀerent
metabolic strategies. (B) is incorrect because both bacteria and algae
are capable of having cell walls. Additionally, cell walls mainly function
to provide structural support and protect cells from osmotic lysis. They
oﬀer little protection with respect to extreme pH conditions like those
that exist in the Rio Tinto. While chemotaxis may direct bacterial
movement toward a region of higher pH or away from a region of
lower pH, it cannot be assumed that these pockets exist in the river.
Finally, neither of the structures mentioned in (B) provides any type of
metabolic advantage. (C) is incorrect because prokaryotes usually
evolve faster than eukaryotes due to their usage of asexual
reproduction and short generation times.

Both starch and cellulose are polymers of glucose, eliminating (C).
Structurally, starch contains 1-4 glycosidic linkages of alpha glucose
monomers, while
