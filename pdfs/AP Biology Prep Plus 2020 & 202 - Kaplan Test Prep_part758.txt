on ancestor. (C) is incorrect because some lizard
clades (such as the Iguania) are more closely related to snakes and
mosasaurs than they are to other lizards, such as the Gekkota. (D) is
incorrect because this cladogram is not organized according to
timescale, but rather according to common ancestry; extinct species
are not localized to a specific part of the diagram.

The groups that branch earliest lack tube building, suggesting that
tube building evolved in a common ancestor of the Ampithoe, Caprella,
and Aroidae but was secondarily lost in the Caprella. (B) is thus
correct. (A) is incorrect because tube building is only found in groups
that emerge from a later common ancestor. (C) is incorrect because
more than half of the groups in the diagram lack temperature
tolerance, so it seems improbable that it was possessed by the
progenitor of all of these groups. (D) is incorrect because the
Caprella lack temperature tolerance.
