in constant motion and tend to spread out if
there is nothing in the way. In solution, molecules naturally move from
areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. This is called
moving down or with the concentration gradient. Simple diﬀusion
refers to the movement of particles down their concentration gradient.
This form of passive transport takes place directly through the cell
membrane lipid bilayer without using any form of energy or membrane
proteins in order to move particles. Again, small nonpolar molecules
move most freely by simple diﬀusion. Examples include water (small but
polar), carbon dioxide (nonpolar), and oxygen (nonpolar). 
The simple diﬀusion of water is referred to as osmosis and occurs from a
region of higher water concentration to a region of lower water
concentration. For water to be in high concentration, the amount of
dissolved solute (salts, sugars, etc.) must be low, and vice versa for water
in low concentration. So, although water diﬀusion works
