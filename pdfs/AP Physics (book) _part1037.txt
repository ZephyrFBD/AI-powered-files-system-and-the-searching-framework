pressure—the amount by which P exceeds atmospheric pressure 
If the liquid
in the left-hand column were lower than that in the right-hand column, P would
have to be less than atmospheric pressure (and 
would be negative).
Instead of calculating the product 
sometimes only the change in height 
is specified. In fact, pressures are sometimes specified as so many “millimeters 
of mercury” (mm-Hg) or “mm of water”
The unit mm-Hg is equivalent
to a pressure of

The unit mm-Hg is also called the torr in honor of Evangelista Torricelli
(1608–1647), a student of Galileo’s who invented the barometer (see top of next
page). Conversion factors among the various units of pressure (an incredible
nuisance!) are given in Table 10–2. It is important that only
the
proper SI unit, be used in calculations involving other quantities specified in 
SI units.
Another type of pressure gauge is the aneroid gauge (Fig. 10–7b) in which
the pointer is linked to the flexible e
