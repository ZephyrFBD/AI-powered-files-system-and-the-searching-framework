he
self-inductance L of a long tightly wrapped solenoid coil of length and cross-
sectional area A, that contains N turns (or loops) of wire. (b) Calculate the value
of L if
and the solenoid is air filled.
APPROACH The induced emf in a coil can be determined either from Faraday’s
law 
or the self-inductance 
If we equate
these two expressions, we can solve for the inductance L since we know how to
calculate the flux 
for a solenoid using Eq. 20–8 (
).
SOLUTION (a) We equate Faraday’s law (Eq. 21–2b) and Eq. 21–9 for the
inductance:
and solve for L:
We know
(Eq. 21–1), and Eq. 20–8 gives us the magnetic field B for
a solenoid,
so the magnetic flux inside the solenoid is
Any change in current,
causes a change in flux
We put this into our equation above for L:
(b) Using
and putting in values given,
L =
A4p * 10–7 TmAB(100)2A3.0 * 10–5 m2B
A5.0 * 10–2 mB
= 7.5 mH.
m0 = 4p * 10–7 TmA,
