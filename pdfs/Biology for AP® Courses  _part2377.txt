numbers of antiviral drugs available to treat infections, some
specific for a particular virus and others that can affect multiple viruses.
Antivirals have been developed to treat herpes and influenza. For herpes, drugs such as acyclovir can reduce the number
and duration of episodes of active viral disease, during which patients develop viral lesions in their skin cells. As the virus
remains latent in nervous tissue of the body for life, this drug is not curative but can make the symptoms of the disease more
manageable. For influenza, drugs like oseltamivir (Figure 21.16) can reduce the duration of “flu” symptoms by 1 or 2 days,
but the drug does not prevent symptoms entirely. Oseltamivir works by inhibiting an enzyme (viral neuraminidase) that
allows new virions to leave their infected cells. Thus, Oseltamivir inhibits the spread of virus from infected to uninfected
cells. Other antiviral drugs, such as Ribavirin, have been used to treat a variety of viral infections, although its me
