molecular signals that regulate cell transitions through the various checkpoints.
Passage through the G1 checkpoint makes sure that the cell is ready for DNA replication in the S stage of interphase; passage
through the G2 checkpoint triggers the separation of chromatids during mitosis. Positive regulator molecules like the cyclins
and Cdks allow the cell cycle to advance to the next stage; negative regulator molecules, such as tumor suppressor proteins,
monitor cellular conditions and can halt the cycle until specific requirements are met. Errors in the regulation of the cell
cycle can cause cancer, which is characterized by uncontrolled cell division.
