al weak acid as 
HA, we can write the equation for its ionization in either of the following ways, depend-
ing on whether the hydrated proton is represented as H3O+1aq2 or H+1aq2:
 
HA1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ H3O+1aq2 + A-1aq2 
[16.23]
or
 
HA1aq2 ∆ H+1aq2 + A-1aq2 
[16.24]
These equilibria are in aqueous solution, so we will use equilibrium-constant expres-
sions based on concentrations. Because H2O is the solvent, it is omitted from the

 (Section 15.4) Further, we add a subscript a on the 
equilibrium constant to indicate that it is an equilibrium constant for the ionization of 
an acid. Thus, we can write the equilibrium-const
