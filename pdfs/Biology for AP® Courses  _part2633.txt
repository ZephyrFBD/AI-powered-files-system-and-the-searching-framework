vels the length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue. The edge of the leaf is
called the margin. Figure 23.21 shows the structure of a typical eudicot leaf.
Figure 23.21 Deceptively simple in appearance, a leaf is a highly efficient structure.
Within each leaf, the vascular tissue forms veins. The arrangement of veins in a leaf is called the venation pattern. Monocots
and dicots differ in their patterns of venation (Figure 23.22). Monocots have parallel venation; the veins run in straight
lines across the length of the leaf without converging at a point. In dicots, however, the veins of the leaf have a net-like
appearance, forming a pattern known as reticulate venation. One extant plant, the Ginkgo biloba, has dichotomous venation
where the veins fork.
