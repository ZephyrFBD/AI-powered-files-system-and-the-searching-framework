Circuit with series and parallel resistors. How much
current is drawn from the battery shown in Fig. 19–7a?
APPROACH The current I that flows out of the battery all passes through the
resistor, but then it splits into 
and 
passing through the 
and
resistors. The latter two resistors are in parallel with each other. We look
for something that we already know how to treat. So let’s start by finding the
equivalent resistance,
of the parallel resistors,
and 
Then we
can consider this 
to be in series with the 
resistor.
