he work a hiker must
do on a 15.0-kg backpack to carry it up a hill of height  
as shown in
Fig. 6–4a. Determine also (b) the work done by gravity on the backpack, and 
(c) the net work done on the backpack. For simplicity, assume the motion is
smooth and at constant velocity (i.e., acceleration is zero).
APPROACH We explicitly follow the steps of the Problem Solving Strategy above.
SOLUTION
1. Draw a free-body diagram. The forces on the backpack are shown in Fig.6–4b:
the force of gravity,
acting downward; and 
the force the hiker must
exert upward to support the backpack. The acceleration is zero, so horizontal
forces on the backpack are negligible.
2. Choose a coordinate system. We are interested in the vertical motion of the
backpack, so we choose the y coordinate as positive vertically upward.
3. Apply Newton’s laws. Newton’s second law applied in the vertical direction
to the backpack gives (with  
)
So,
4. Work done by a specific force. (a) To calculate the work done by the hike
