In the simple
potentiometer circuit shown in Fig. 19–94,
represents
the total resistance of the resistor from A to B (which could
be a long uniform “slide” wire), whereas R represents the
resistance of only the part from A to the movable contact
at C. When the unknown emf to be measured,
is placed
into the circuit as shown, the movable contact C is moved
until the galvanometer G gives a null reading (i.e., zero)
when the switch S is closed. The resistance between A and C
for this situation we call 
Next, a standard emf,
which is known precisely, is inserted into the circuit in place
of 
and again the contact C is moved until zero current
flows through the galvanometer when the switch S is closed.
The resistance between A and C now is called
