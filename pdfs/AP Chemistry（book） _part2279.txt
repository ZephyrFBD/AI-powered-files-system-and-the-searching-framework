Give It Some Thought
In general, which type of catalyst, homogeneous or heterogeneous, will be easier to 
recover from the reaction mixture?
Enzymes
The human body is characterized by an extremely complex system of interrelated 
chemical reactions, all of which must occur at carefully controlled rates to maintain 
life. A large number of marvelously efficient biological catalysts known as enzymes 
are necessary for many of these reactions to occur at suitable rates. Most enzymes are 
large protein molecules with molecular weights ranging from about 10,000 to about 
 
1 million amu. They are very selective in the reactions they catalyze, and some are
