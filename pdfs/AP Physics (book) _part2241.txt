All the quantities on the right side are known or can be measured, and thus m can

Historically, the masses of many atoms were measured this way. When a pure
substance was used, it was sometimes found that two or more closely spaced
marks would appear on the film. For example, neon produced two marks whose
radii corresponded to atoms of 20 and 22 atomic mass units (u). Impurities were
ruled out and it was concluded that there must be two types of neon with differ-
ent masses. These different forms were called isotopes. It was soon found that most
elements are mixtures of isotopes, and the difference in mass
