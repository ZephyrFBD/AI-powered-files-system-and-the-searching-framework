ly dissolved strong electrolytes 
(such as soluble ionic compounds) are written as separate ions.  
As the (aq) designations remind us, CaCl2, Na2CO3, and NaCl are 
all dissolved in the solution. Furthermore, they are all strong  
electrolytes. CaCO3 is an ionic compound, but it is not soluble. 
We do not write the formula of any insoluble compound as its 
component ions. Thus, the complete ionic equation is
Ca2+1aq2 + 2 Cl-1aq2 + 2 Na+1aq2 + CO3
2-1aq2 ¡
CaCO31s2 + 2 Na+1aq2 + 2 Cl-1aq2
The spectator ions are Na+ and Cl-. Canceling them gives the  
following net ionic equation:
 
Ca2+1aq2 + CO3
2-1aq2 ¡ CaCO31s2 
Check We can check our result by confirming that both the ele-
ments and the electric charge are balanced. Each side has one Ca, 
one C, and three O, and the net charge on each side equals 0.
Comment If none of the ions in an ionic equation is removed from 
solution or changed in some way, all ions are spectator ions and a 
reaction does not occur.
