hich nutrients and energy pass: primary producers, primary consumers, and higher-level
consumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics. There is a single path through the chain. Each organism
in a food chain occupies what is called a trophic level. Depending on their role as producers or consumers, species or
groups of species can be assigned to various trophic levels.
In many ecosystems, the bottom of the food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms (plants and/or phytoplankton),
which are called primary producers. The organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores: the primary
consumers. Secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers. Tertiary consumers are
carnivores that eat other carnivores. Higher-level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels, and so on, up to the
organisms at the top of the food chain: the apex consumers. In the Lake Ontario food chain shown in Figure 37.4, the
Chinook salmon is the apex consumer
