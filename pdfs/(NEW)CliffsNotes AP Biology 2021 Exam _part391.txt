ss detail in one step does not
improve your score. Providing a few pieces of information for every part optimizes your time and maximizes your
score. For example, you would not improve your score by discussing, in detail, the structure of the poly-A tail or 5â€²
cap of the mRNA. Also, details about the regulation of transcription would provide more than the question asks.
However, if you omit an explanation of the genetic code, you would probably lose 1 or 2 points out of a maximum of
10.
Question 2
a. Viruses cause disease by destroying cells. Viruses consist of a nucleic acid core (either DNA or RNA) and a
protein coat. In the lytic cycle of reproduction, a DNA virus enters a cell and uses the metabolic machinery and raw
materials of the cell to manufacture more viral DNA and viral protein coats. The viral DNA and protein assemble
into hundreds of new viruses that burst from the cell, killing the cell in the process. In the lysogenic cycle, the virus
may temporarily remain dormant as p
