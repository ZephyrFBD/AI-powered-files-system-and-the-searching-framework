What feature of this structure suggests 
that the two outer O atoms are in some 
way equivalent to each other?
To understand why certain molecules require more than one resonance 
structure, we can draw an analogy to mixing paint (Figure 8.14). Blue and yel-
low are both primary colors of paint pigment. An equal blend of blue and yellow 
pigments produces green pigment. We cannot describe green paint in terms of a 
single primary color, yet it still has its own identity. Green paint does not oscil-
late between its two primary colors: It is not blue part of the time and yellow the 
rest of the time. Similarly, molecules such as ozone cannot be described as oscil-
lating between the two individual Lewis structures shown previously—there are 
two equivalent dominant Lewis
