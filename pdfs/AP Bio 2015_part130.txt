light intensity at lower elevations 
Less DNA/tissue damage with less 
UV light 
Nutrients 
More accessible nutrients in richer soil at lower 
elevations 
Increased nutrient availability can 
enhance plant growth 
Herbivore 
More herbivores/herbivory at higher elevations 
High herbivory prevents plants 
from migrating to higher elevations

Question 8
The graph above shows the initial rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction at different substrate 
concentrations in the presence of a constant concentration of enzyme. 
(a) Connect the primary structure of the enzyme to its overall shape. 
Connection (1 point) 
The amino acid sequence determines the overall shape (of the polypeptide/protein/enzyme)  
R-groups interact and stabilize the structure 
(b) Predict the effect of adding a noncompetitive inhibitor to the reaction mixture on the rate of 
reaction at a high substrate
