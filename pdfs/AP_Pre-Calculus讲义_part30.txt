term anxn is the leading term. 
 
 
 
If a polynomial consists of just a single term, then it is called a monomial.  
For example, P(x) = x3 and Q(x) = -6x5 are monomials 
 
1.6.2 Graphing Basic Polynomial Functions 
The simplest polynomial functions are the monomials P(x) = xn.

As the figure suggests, the graph of P(x) = xn has the same general shape as the graph of 
y = x2 when n is even and the same general shape as the graph as y = x3 when n is odd. 
 
Example 1 
Sketch graphs of the following functions. 
(a) P(x) = - x3 
(b) Q(x) = (x - 2)4 
(c) R(x) = - 2x5 + 4 
 
 
 
 
1.6.3 End Behavior of Polynomial Functions 
The graphs of polynomials of degree 0 or 1 are lines, and the graphs of polynomials of 
degree 2 are parabolas. The greater the degree of a polynomial, the more complicated its 
graph can be. 
However, the graph of a polynomial function is continuous. This means that the graph 
has no breaks or holes.
