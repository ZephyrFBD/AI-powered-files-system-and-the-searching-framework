ition state to form. Thus, the reaction can
occur more quickly because the tricky transition state is not as much of a hurdle to overcome. Enzymes do NOT
change the energy of the starting point or the ending point of the reaction. They only lower the activation energy.
Enzyme Specificity
Most of the crucial reactions that occur in the cell require enzymes. Yet enzymes themselves are highly specificâ€”in
fact, each enzyme catalyzes only one kind of reaction. This is known as enzyme specificity. Because of this,
enzymes are usually named after the molecules they target. In enzymatic reactions, the targeted molecules are
known as substrates. For example, maltose, a disaccharide, can be broken down into two glucose molecules. Our
substrate, maltose, gives its name to the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction: maltase.
Many enzymes are named simply by replacing the suffix of the substrate with -ase. Using this nomenclature,
maltose becomes maltase.
Enzyme-Substrate Complex
Enzymes have a unique
