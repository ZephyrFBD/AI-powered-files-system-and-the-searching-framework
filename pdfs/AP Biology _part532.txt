, and pollute the air and water. Here are several examples of this.
Eutrophication of the Lakes
Humans have disrupted freshwater ecosystems, causing a process called
eutrophication. Runoff from sewage and manure from pastures increase
nutrients in lakes and cause excessive growth of algae and other plants.
Shallow areas become choked with weeds, and swimming and boating
become impossible. As these large populations of photosynthetic
organisms die, two things happen. First, organic material accumulates on

the lake bottom and reduces the depth of the lake. Second, detritivores use
up oxygen as they decompose the dead organic matter. Lower oxygen
levels make it impossible for some fish to live. As fish die, decomposers
expand their activity and oxygen levels continue to decrease. The process
continues, more organisms die, the oxygen levels decrease, more
decomposing matter accumulates on the lake bottom, and ultimately, the
lake disappears. See
