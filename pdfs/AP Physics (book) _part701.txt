FIGURE 7;5 Example 7–3.
Railroad cars collide: momentum conserved. A 10,000-kg
railroad car, A, traveling at a speed of 
strikes an identical car, B, at 
rest. If the cars lock together as a result of the collision, what is their common
speed just afterward? See Fig. 7–5.
APPROACH We choose our system to be the two railroad cars. We consider a very
brief time interval, from just before the collision until just after, so that external
forces such as friction can be ignored. Then we apply conservation of momentum.

SOLUTION The initial total momentum is
because car B is at rest initially  
The direction is to the right in the 
direction. After the collision, the two
