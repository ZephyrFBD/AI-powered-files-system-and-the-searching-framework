 taiga, temperate deciduous forest, grasslands, deserts, tropical
rainforests) that make up the biosphere. Each biosphere contains ecosystems.
Within an ecosystem are communities, which consist of organisms fulfilling one of three main roles:
Producers, or autotrophs, convert light energy to chemical energy via photosynthesis.
Consumers, or heterotrophs, acquire energy from the things they consume. Their digestion of carbohydrates
produces carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, which are then used to make organic substances.
Decomposers form fossil fuels from the detritus of other organisms in the ecosystem.
The 10% rule says that only 10% of the energy consumed from one level will be retained by the higher
level that consumed it. The other energy will be spent to perform normal daily activities.
The smallest unit of ecology is the population. The growth of a population can be found with the equation (r) =
(births â€“ deaths) / N.
The carrying capacity is the maximum number of individuals that ca
