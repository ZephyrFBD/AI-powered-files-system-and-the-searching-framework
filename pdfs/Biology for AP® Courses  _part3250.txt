kes retinal, it changes shape from (b) a cis to a trans form. The signal is passed to a G-protein
called transducin, triggering a series of downstream events.

Figure 27.20 When light strikes rhodopsin, the G-protein transducin is activated, which in turn activates
phosphodiesterase. Phosphodiesterase converts cGMP to GMP, thereby closing sodium channels. As a result, the
membrane becomes hyperpolarized. The hyperpolarized membrane does not release glutamate to the bipolar cell.
Trichromatic Coding
There are three types of cones (with different photopsins), and they differ in the wavelength to which they are most
responsive, as shown in Figure 27.21. Some cones are maximally responsive to short light waves of 420 nm, so they are
called S cones (“S” for “short”); others respond maximally to waves of 530 nm (M cones, for “medium”); a third group
responds maximally to light of longer wavelengths, at 560 nm (L, or “long” cones). With only one type of cone,
