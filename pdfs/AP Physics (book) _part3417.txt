32. (II) The nuclide 
decays by emitting an electron whose
maximum kinetic energy can be 1.71 MeV. (a) What is the
daughter nucleus? (b) Calculate the daughter’s atomic
mass (in u).
33. (II) A photon with a wavelength of 
is
ejected from an atom. Calculate its energy and explain why
it is a ray from the nucleus or a photon from the atom.
34. (II) How much recoil energy does a 
nucleus get when it
emits a 1.46-MeV gamma ray?
35. (II) Determine the maximum kinetic energy of 
particles
released when 
decays to 
What is the maximum
energy the neutrino can have? What is the minimum energy
of each?
36. (III) Show that when a nucleus decays by 
decay, the
total energy released is equal to
where 
and 
are the masses of the parent and daugh-
ter atoms (neutral), and 
is the mass of an electron or
positron.
37. (III) When 
decays, the 
particle emitted has 4.20 MeV
of kinetic energy. Calculate the recoil kinetic energy of the
daughter nucleus and the Q-value of the decay.
