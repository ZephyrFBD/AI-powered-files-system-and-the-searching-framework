7. (II) Two cords support a chandelier in the manner shown
in Fig. 9–4 except that the upper cord makes an angle of
45° with the ceiling. If the cords can sustain a force of
1660 N without breaking, what is the maximum chandelier
weight that can be supported?
8. (II) The two trees in Fig. 9–51 are 6.6 m apart. A back-
packer is trying to lift his pack out of the reach of bears.
Calculate the magnitude of the force 
that he must exert
downward to hold a 19-kg backpack so that the rope sags
at its midpoint by (a) 1.5 m, (b) 0.15 m.

9. (II) A 110-kg horizontal beam is supported at each end.
A 320-kg piano rests a quarter of the way from one end.
What is the vertical force on each of the supports?
