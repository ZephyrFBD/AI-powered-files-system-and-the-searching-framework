ther is made to move, Fig. 10–31. The fluid directly in 
contact with each plate is held to the surface by the adhesive force between the
molecules of the liquid and those of the plate. Thus the upper surface of the 
fluid moves with the same speed v as the upper plate, whereas the fluid in contact
with the stationary plate remains stationary. The stationary layer of fluid retards
the flow of the layer just above it, which in turn retards the flow of the next layer,
and so on. Thus the velocity varies continuously from 0 to v, as shown. The
increase in velocity divided by the distance over which this change is made—equal
to
—is called the velocity gradient. To move the upper plate requires a force,
which you can verify by moving a flat plate across a puddle of syrup on a table.
For a given fluid, it is found that the force required, F, is proportional to the 
area of fluid in contact with each plate, A, and to the speed, v, and is inversely
proportional to the separation,
of the plates
