33. (III) I agree to hire you for 30 days. You can decide between
two methods of payment: either (1) $1000 a day, or (2) one
penny on the first day, two pennies on the second day and

You then go to that sailboat on the other side of the
lake and measure that the deck is 1.5 m above
the level of the water. Using
