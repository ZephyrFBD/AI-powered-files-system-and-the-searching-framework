nce the infiltrated disks have floated because of 
photosynthesis, the rate of cellular respiration can be determined by placing the systems 
in a dark environment. If the disks are still swirled after each minute, the process of 
cellular respiration will consume the oxygen bubbles in the mesophyll spaces, causing 
the disks to sink again. This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 4.

(In this case, the cup with floating disks was placed under a cardboard box with no light 
at the 14-minute mark. Note that the slope of the sinking rate is less than that of the 
floating rate.) 
There are many research papers on the Internet that explore photosynthesis. These 
studies can serve as guides to the kinds of questions that students can ask. For example, 
if you put the terms “photosynthesis light response curve” into your search engine, you
