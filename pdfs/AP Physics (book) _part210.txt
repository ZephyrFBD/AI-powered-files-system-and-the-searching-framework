CHAPTER 2
Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension
26. (II) A world-class sprinter can reach a top speed (of about
) in the first 18.0 m of a race. What is the average
acceleration of this sprinter and how long does it take her
to reach that speed?
27. (II) A car slows down uniformly from a speed of 
to rest in 8.00 s. How far did it travel in th
