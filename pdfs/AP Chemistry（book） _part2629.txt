entration of H+1aq2 
can be expressed in terms of pH: pH = -log3H+4. At 25 °C the pH 
of a neutral solution is 7.00, whereas the pH of an acidic solution is 
below 7.00, and the pH of a basic solution is above 7.00. This p nota-
tion is also used to represent the negative logarithm of other small 
quantities, as in pOH and pKw. The pH of a solution can be measured 
using a pH meter, or it can be estimated using acid–base indicators.
STRONG ACIDS AND BASES (SECTION 16.5) Strong acids are 
strong electrolytes, ionizing completely in aqueous solution. The 
common strong acids are HCl, HBr, HI, HNO3, HClO3, HClO4, and 
H2SO4. The conjugate bases of strong acids have negligible basicity. 
Common strong bases are the ionic hydroxides of the alkali metals 
and the heavy alkaline earth metals.
WEAK ACIDS AND BASES (SECTIONS 16.6 AND 16.7) Weak acids 
are weak electrolytes; only a small fraction of the molecules exist in 
solution in ionized form. The extent of ionization is expressed by 
the a
