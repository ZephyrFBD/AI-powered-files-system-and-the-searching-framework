t faces away from the sunlight grows faster, thanks to the plant’s auxins,
making the plant bend toward the light.
Generally speaking, auxins are in the tip of the plant, because this is where most growth occurs. Auxins are also
involved in cell elongation and fruit development.
Other plant hormones that regulate the growth and development of plants are gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylenes,
and abscisic acid. Here’s a summary of the functions of plant hormones:
FUNCTIONS OF PLANT HORMONES
Hormone
Function
Gibberellins
Promote stem elongation, especially in dwarf plants
Cytokinins
Promote cell division and differentiation
Ethylene
Induces leaf abscission and promotes fruit ripening
Abscisic acid
Inhibits leaf abscission and promotes bud and seed dor​mancy
Auxins
Promote plant growth and phototropism
We’ve already discussed how important cell communication is to organisms, and plants are no exception. These
hormones play an important role in allowing plants to grow, develop, survive, and
