nal organs, and cardiovascular system—play a role.
Recall that the epidermis is the outermost layer of skin in mammals. It is relatively thin, is composed of keratin-filled cells,
and has no blood supply. The epidermis serves as a barrier to water and to invasion by pathogens. Below this, the much
thicker dermis contains blood vessels, sweat glands, hair follicles, lymph vessels, and lipid-secreting sebaceous glands
(Figure 27.4). Below the epidermis and dermis is the subcutaneous tissue, or hypodermis, the fatty layer that contains blood
vessels, connective tissue, and the axons of sensory neurons. The hypodermis, which holds about 50 percent of the body’s
fat, attaches the dermis to the bone and muscle, and supplies nerves and blood vessels to the dermis.
