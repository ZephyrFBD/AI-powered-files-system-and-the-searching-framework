Bushdid et al. (Science, 343, 2014) extended this model
and then used human subjects to experimentally determine
the number of unique odorant molecules that they could
discriminate to obtain an estimate of 1.72 trillion different
detectible smells.
Olfactory receptor proteins that recognize chemicals as
odors are expressed in humans by approximately 400
different genes. This is the largest number of genes coding
for a single function in the human genome (Nimura,
Human Genetics, 4, 2009). Other mammals have an even
greater diversity of olfactory receptors: roughly 800 and
1200 genes in dogs and rats, respectively. Some olfactory
receptors are adapted for odorants in an aqueous
environment and some are adapted for an air environment.
