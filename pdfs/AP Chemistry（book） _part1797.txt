(b) On cooling to 160 K, both substances form 
crystalline solids. Do you expect the molar volumes to 
decrease or increase on cooling the gases to 160 K? (c) The 
densities of crystalline Cl2 and NH3 at 160 K are 2.02 and 
0.84 g>cm3, respectively. Calculate their molar volumes. 
(d) Are the molar volumes in the solid state as similar as 
they are in the gaseous state? Explain. (e) Would you expect 
the molar volumes in the liquid state to be closer to those 
in the solid or gaseous state?
 11.14  Benzoic acid, C6H5COOH, melts at 122 °C. The density 
in the liquid state at 130 °C is 1.08 g>cm3. The density of 
solid benzoic acid at 15 °C is 1.266 g>cm3. (a) In which of 
these two states is the average distance between molecules 
greater? (b) If you converted a cubic centimeter of liquid 
benzoic acid into a solid, would the solid take up more, or 
less, volume than the original cubic centimeter of liquid?
