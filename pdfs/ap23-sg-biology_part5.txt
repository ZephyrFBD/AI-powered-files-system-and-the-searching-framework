(c) 
Based on the data in Table 1, identify the yeast strain and growth conditions that lead to 
the highest relative amount of PHO1 mRNA. 
• 
Wild-type yeast in a low-Pi environment 
1 point 
 
Calculate the percent change in APase activity in wild-type yeast cells in a high-Pi 
environment compared with that of wild-type cells in a low-Pi environment. 
Accept one of the following:  
• 
3,360%  [(17.3–0.5)/0.5 × 100%] 
• 
   -97%  [(0.5–17.3)/17.3 × 100%]

(d) 
In a follow-up experiment, researchers created a strain of yeast with a mutation that 
resulted in a nonfunctional Pho85 protein. Based on Figure 1, predict the effects of this 
mutation on PHO1 expression in the mutant strain in a high-Pi environment. 
• 
It/PHO1/Target genes will be expressed. 
1 point 
 
 
Provide reasoning to justify your prediction. 
• 
(In a high-Pi environment) a nonfunctional Pho85 will be unable to 
phosphorylate/inhi
