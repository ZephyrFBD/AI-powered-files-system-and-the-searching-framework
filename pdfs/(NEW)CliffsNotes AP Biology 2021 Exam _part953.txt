to the gaseous state.
37. B. If the proton channels associated with ATP synthase are blocked,
 
H+ cannot move from the intermembrane space (the compartment
 
between the inner and outer membranes) across the cristae membranes
 
into the matrix. The expectation, then, is that H+ concentration increases
 
in the intermembrane space.
38. D. The more often a phase appears, the longer it takes for that phase to occur. According to the data, metaphase
appeared the fewest number of times; so, compared to the other phases, metaphase took the least amount of time to
occur. Interphase took the most time, but not longer than all other phases combined (according to the data
presented).
39. A. Because lysosomes are sites of chemical breakdown (catabolic processes), the abnormal accumulation of
substances within them results from the absence or malfunction of a lysosomal enzyme. These are generally called
lysosomal storage diseases and include diseases where various undigested materials, including
