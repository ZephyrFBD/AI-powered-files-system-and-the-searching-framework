 
There are two ways to carry out the Designing and Conducting Independent  
Investigations section.  
1. You can have the students build their models to explore other aspects of H-W 
equilibrium. This is suggested in the Student Manual. Have the students build 
models that explore selection and multigenerations, mutation, or migration. 
However, because students will have a limited skill set for working in the spreadsheet 
environment even at this point, this option might not be time effective. 
2. The alternative is to have students move from their spreadsheet models to more 
sophisticated models available on the Internet to answer their own questions; see 
the suggested online options that follow. In this option, while the students are 
not building the model, they are applying their knowledge of models to explore 
questions about population genetics. 
Options for More Advanced Modeling Experiences 
Have students generate their own questions regarding the evolution of allele
