19. In a recent study, researchers classified men with many diï¬€erent levels of
hair loss into four groups: no hair loss, slight hair loss, moderate hair loss,
and severe hair loss. They analyzed a large number of genes associated
with hair loss and then classified individuals by a genetic risk score,
ranging from 1 to 10.
Based on the data from the graph, does the male pattern for baldness
follow a Mendelian inheritance pattern?

Yes, because individuals can be classified into distinct groups.
(A)
No, because there is continuous variation in this trait and a complex
inheritance pattern.
(B)
Yes, because individuals with greater genetic risk are more likely to
have severe baldness.
(C)
No
