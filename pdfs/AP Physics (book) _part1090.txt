Insect walks on water. The base of an insect’s
leg is approximately spherical in shape, with a radius of about 
The 0.0030-g mass of the insect is supported equally by its six legs. Estimate the
angle (see Fig. 10–36) for an insect on the surface of water. Assume the water
temperature is 20°C.
APPROACH Since the insect is in equilibrium, the upward surface tension force
is equal to the pull of gravity downward on each leg. We ignore buoyant forces
for this estimate.
SOLUTION For each leg, we assume the surface tension force acts all ar
