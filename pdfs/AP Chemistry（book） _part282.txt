Sample Exercise 2.2 
Determining the Number of Subatomic Particles in Atoms
How many protons, neutrons, and electrons are in an atom of (a) 197Au, (b) strontium-90?
SOLUTION
(a) The superscript 197 is the mass number 1protons + neutrons2. 
According to the list of elements given on the front inside cover, 
gold has atomic number 79. Consequently, an atom of 197
Au has 
79 protons, 79 electrons, and 197 - 79 = 118 neutrons. (b) The 
atomic number of strontium is 38. Thus, all atoms of this element 
have 38 protons and 38 electrons. The strontium-90 isotope has 
90 - 38 =52 neutrons.
