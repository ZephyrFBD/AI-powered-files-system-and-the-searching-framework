der nonstandard conditions, 
we use the Nernst equation in the form of Equation 20.18.
Check This result is qualitatively what we expect: Because the 
concentration of Cr2O7
2- (a reactant) is greater than 1 M and 
the concentration of Cr3+ (a product) is less than 1 M, the emf 
is greater than E °. Because Q is about 10-10, log Q is about -10. 
Thus, the correction to E ° is about 0.06 * 10>6, which is 0.1, in 
agreement with the more detailed calculation.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Consider a voltaic cell whose overall reaction is 
Pb2+1aq2 + Zn1s2 ¡ Pb1s2 + Zn2+1aq2. What is the emf 
generated by this voltaic cell when the ion concentrations are 
3Pb2+4 = 1.5 * 10-3 M and 3Zn2+4 = 0.55 M? 
(a) 0.71 V (b) 0.56 V (c) 0.49 V (d) 0.79 V (e) 0.64 V
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
For the Zn–Cu voltaic cell depicted in Figure 20.5, would the 
emf increase, decrease, or stay the same, if you increased the 
Cu2+1aq2 concentration by adding CuSO4 # 5H2O to the cath-
ode compartment?
