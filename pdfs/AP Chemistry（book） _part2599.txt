r the solution is basic, 
neutral, or acidic depends on the relative abilities of the ions to react with water.

▲ Figure 16.18 A hydrated Fe3+ ion acts as an acid by donating an H+ from a bound water molecule to a free H2O molecule, forming H3O+.
Determine whether aqueous solutions of each of these salts are acidic, basic, or neutral: (a) Ba1CH3COO22, (b) NH4Cl,  
(c) CH3NH3Br, (d) KNO3, (e) Al1ClO423.
Sample Exercise 16.18 
Determining Whether Salt Solutions Are Acidic, Basic, or Neutral
of the solution. Because the solution contains an ion that is 
acidic 1NH4
+2 and one that has no inﬂuence on pH 1Cl-2, the 
solution of NH4Cl will be acidic.
(c) Here CH3NH3
+ is the conjugate acid of a weak base 1CH3NH
