The evolution of genes may be a familiar concept. Mutations can occur in genes during DNA replication, and
the result may or may not be beneficial to the cell. By altering an enzyme, structural protein, or some other
factor, the process of mutation can transform functions or physical features. However, eukaryotic promoters
and other gene regulatory sequences may evolve as well. For instance, consider a gene that, over many
generations, becomes more valuable to the cell. Maybe the gene encodes a structural protein that the cell
needs to synthesize in abundance for a certain function. If this is the case, it would be beneficial to the cell
for that geneâ€™s promoter to recruit transcription factors more efficiently and increase gene expression.
Scientists examining the evolution of promoter sequences have reported varying results. In part, this is
because it is difficult to infer exactly where a eukaryotic promoter begins and ends. Some promoters occur
within genes; others
