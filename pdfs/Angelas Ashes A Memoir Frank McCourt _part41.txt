 The Italian says, Missus, you always pay your bill sooner or later and 
 
 you can have anything you like in this store. 
 
 Oh, she says, I don’t want much. 
 
 Anything you like, missus, because I know you’re an honest woman 
 
 and you got a bunch o’ nice kids there. 
 
 We have eggs and toast and jam though we’re so weary walking the 
 
 long streets of Brooklyn we can barely move our jaws to chew.The twins 
 
 fall asleep after eating and Mam lays them on the bed to change their diapers. 
 
 She sends me down the hall to rinse the dirty diapers in the lavatory 
 
 so that they can be hung up to dry and used the next day. Malachy helps 
 
 her wash the twins’ bottoms though he’s ready to fall asleep himself. 
 
 I crawl into bed with Malachy and the twins. I look out at Mam at 
 
 the kitchen table, smoking a cigarette, drinking tea, and crying. I want 
 
 to get up and tell her I’ll be a man soon and I’ll get a job in the place
