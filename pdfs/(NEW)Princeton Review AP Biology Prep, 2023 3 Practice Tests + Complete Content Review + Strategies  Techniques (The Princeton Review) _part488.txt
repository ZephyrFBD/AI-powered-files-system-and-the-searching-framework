three females, 37.5 to have two females and a male, 37.5 to
have one female and two males, and 12.5 to have three males. This can be calculated by multiplying the probability
of each event by the total (100 in this case).
Next, we compare this expected data (E) to what actually happened (the observed data, O). Note that the total
numbers for observed and expected columns must be the same (in this case, they each have a total of 100). To
calculate an χ2 value, the formula (O – E)2/E is calculated for each row of the table, and summed.

The calculated χ2 value is 6.24. Next, this value needs to be compared to a critical value (CV). This is obtained from
a table like this one.
