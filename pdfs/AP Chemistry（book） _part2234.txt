top panel of Figure 14.14. In contrast, in the collision shown in the lower panel, the two Cl 
atoms are not colliding directly with one another, and no products are formed.
Activation Energy
Molecular orientation is not the only factor influencing whether a molecular collision 
will produce a reaction. In 1888 the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius suggested that 
molecules must possess a certain minimum amount of energy to react. According to the 
collision model, this energy comes from the kinetic energies of the colliding molecules. 
Upon collision, the kinetic energy of the molecules can be used to stretch, bend, and 
ultimately break bonds, leading to chemical reactions. That is, the kinetic energy is used 
to change the potential energy of the molecule. If molecules are moving too slowly—in 
other words, with too little kinetic energy—they merely bounce off one another with-
out changing. The minimum energy required to initiate a chemical reaction is called th
