riction was generated in
this process?
48. (II) A ski starts from rest and slides down a 28° incline 85 m
long. (a) If the coefficient of friction is 0.090, what is the
ski’s speed at the base of the incline? (b) If the snow is
level at the foot of the incline and has the same coefficient
of friction, how far will the ski travel along the level? Use
energy methods.
49. (II) A 145-g baseball is dropped from a tree 12.0 m above
the ground. (a) With what speed would it hit the ground 
if air resistance could be ignored? (b) If it actually hits the
ground with a speed of 
what is the average force
of air resistance exerted on it?
50. (II) Suppose the roller-coaster car in Fig.6–41 passes point 1
with a speed of 
If the average force of friction is
equal to 0.23 of its weight, with what speed will it reach
point 2? The distance traveled is 45.0 m.
51. (II) A skier traveling 
reaches the foot of a steady
upward 19° incline and glides 15 m up along this slope
before coming to rest. What was t
