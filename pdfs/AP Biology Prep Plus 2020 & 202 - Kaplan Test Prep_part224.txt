nt studying viruses in lab is surprised to find that RNA
viruses tend to have a significantly higher mutation rate than DNA
viruses. What is a potential explanation for this occurrence?
RNA viruses do not have replication error-checking
mechanisms, as DNA viruses do.
(A)
RNA viruses assemble in both the nucleus and cytoplasm,
while DNA viruses assemble solely in the nucleus.
(B)
All RNA viruses contain reverse transcriptase, which
commonly causes frameshiȇ mutations.
(C)
RNA viruses have genome RNA that forms mRNA, which is
then transcribed, bypassing the error-checking mechanisms
that occur during translation altogether.
(D)
