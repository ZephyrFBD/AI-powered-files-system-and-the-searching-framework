eceptacles of nutrients. Food vacuoles often merge with lysosomes, whose digestive
enzymes break down the food.
Contractile vacuoles are specialized organelles in single-celled organisms that collect and pump excess water out of
the cell.
Central vacuoles are large bodies occupying most of the interior of many plant cells. When fully filled, they exert
turgor, or pressure, on the cell walls, thus maintaining rigidity in the cell. The central vacuole provides other
functions as well, some of which specialize the cell for specific functions. These include the following.
• It may store starch, nutrients, pigments, cellular waste, or toxins (nicotine, for example).
 
• It may carry out functions such as digestion that are otherwise assumed by lysosomes in animal cells.
• It provides cell “growth” by simply absorbing water to allow expansion of the cell. In contrast, animal cells require
nutrients to build macromolecules to generate growth.
• It renders a large surface area-to-volume ratio
