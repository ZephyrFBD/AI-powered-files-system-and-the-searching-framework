ions of the salt.
In our examples of the electrolysis of NaCl, the electrodes are inert; they do not react 
but merely serve as the surface where oxidation and reduction occur. Several practical 
applications of electrochemistry, however, are based on active electrodes—electrodes 
that participate in the electrolysis process. Electroplating, for example, uses electrolysis to 
deposit a thin layer of one metal on another metal to improve beauty or resistance to 
corrosion. Examples include electroplating nickel or chromium onto steel and electro-
plating a precious metal like silver onto a less expensive one.
Figure 20.29 illustrates an electrolytic cell for electroplating nickel onto a piece of 
steel. The anode is a strip of nickel metal, and the cathode is the steel. The electrodes 
are immersed in a solution of NiSO41aq2. When an external voltage is applied, reduction 
occurs at the cathode. The standard reduction potential of Ni2+ 1E°
red = -0.28 V2 is less 
negative than that of
