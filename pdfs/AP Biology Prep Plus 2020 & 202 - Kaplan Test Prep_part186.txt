/potassium pump is an active transport process since it
involves the hydrolysis of ATP to provide the necessary energy to push
three sodium molecules out of the cell and draw two potassium
molecules in. Therefore, statement III is false, eliminating (D) and
making (B) the correct answer.
8. A
Learning Objective: 5.3
Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the generation of free
radicals and the ability of the body to neutralize their harmful eﬀects
by using antioxidants. However, as this is outside of the scope of
necessary knowledge for AP Biology, the best approach for this
question is process of elimination. The question stem states that less
acetylcholine is being produced due to the disease. As a result, (B) and
(D) are incorrect because they do not play a role in the production of
acetylcholine (instead, both describe eﬀects on acetylcholine
receptors) and so do not provide any connection between oxidative
stress and the decrease in the neurotransmitter. (C) is incorrect
because
