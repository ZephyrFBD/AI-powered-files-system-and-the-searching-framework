2.96 Gallium (Ga) consists of two naturally occurring isotopes 
with masses of 68.926 and 70.925 amu. (a) How many pro-
tons and neutrons are in the nucleus of each isotope? Write 
the complete atomic symbol for each, showing the atomic 
number and mass number. (b) The average atomic mass of 
Ga is 69.72 amu. Calculate the abundance of each isotope.
 2.97  Using a suitable reference such as the CRC Handbook of 
Chemistry and Physics or http://www.webelements.com, 
look up the following information for nickel: (a) the num-
ber of known isotopes, (b) the atomic masses (in amu), (c) 
the natural abundances of the five most abundant isotopes.
 2.98  There are two different isotopes of bromine atoms. Under 
normal conditions, elemental bromine consists of Br2 mole-
cules, and the mass of a Br2 molecule is the sum of the masses 
of the two atoms in the molecule. The mass spectrum of Br2 
consists of three peaks:
