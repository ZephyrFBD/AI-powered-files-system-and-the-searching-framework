■Chemical signals—Pheromones are chemical signals released by some plants and animals to illicit a
response in other organisms. Skunks release pungent chemicals to scare off potential predators. Female
insects release chemicals (that males of the same species can detect) to initiate mating. Some plants release
chemicals to warn neighbors when an herbivore is damaging them.
■Electrical signals—Sharks and rays send electrical signals through the water to locate prey species.
■Tactile signals—Touching between primates can be used to express affection or to indicate dominance.
Some plants curl up the delicate parts of their body to shield them away from touch.
■Visual signals—Some species use warning coloration, a form of aposematism, to scare off potential
predators. One example of this are the toxic amphibians in the rain forest that are often brightly colored.
Signaling among organisms can help them find mates, determine social hierarchies, and find needed resources.
