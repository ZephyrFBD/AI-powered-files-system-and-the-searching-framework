7. A ball is dropped from the top of a tall building. At the
same instant, a second ball is thrown upward from the
ground level. When the two balls pass one another, one on
the way up, the other on the way down, compare the magni-
tudes of their acceleration:
(a) The acceleration of the dropped ball is greater.
(b) The acceleration of the ball thrown upward is greater.
(c) The acceleration of both balls is the same.
(d) The acceleration changes during the motion, so you
cannot predict the exact value when the two balls
pass each other.
(e) The accelerations are in opposite directions.
8. A ball is thrown downward at a speed of 
Choosing
the
y axis pointing up and neglecting air resistance, which
equation(s) could be used to solve for other variables? The
acceleration due to gravity is
downward.
