graph tells you the rate of change.
Suppose we want to determine how stress hormone levels change after the end of an important exam. If we measure
cortisol and epinephrine in the serum of several people every hour for five hours after the end of an exam, we would
have several values for each time point. We could plot the mean of each measurement and also show data variance
using standard error bars. In this example, the distance above the data point is the standard error, and the distance
below the data point is the standard error. We call this “±SE.”
Comparative Experiments
Comparative experiments compare populations, groups, or events. There are several options for graphing data
from these experiments:
Bar graphs are helpful to compare categories of data if the data is parametric. It is also a good idea to show
variance of the data by including the standard error. This gives information on how different the two means are
from each other. Suppose you compare two strains of fission ye
