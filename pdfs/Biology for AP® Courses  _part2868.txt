nges in their behavior to help regulate body temperature. For example, a desert
ectothermic animal may simply seek cooler areas during the hottest part of the day in the desert to keep from getting too
warm. The same animals may climb onto rocks to capture heat during a cold desert night. Some animals seek water to aid
evaporation in cooling them, as seen with reptiles. Other ectotherms use group activity such as the activity of bees to warm
a hive to survive winter.
Many animals, especially mammals, use metabolic waste heat as a heat source. When muscles are contracted, most of
the energy from the ATP used in muscle actions is wasted energy that translates into heat. Severe cold elicits a shivering
reflex that generates heat for the body. Many species also have a type of adipose tissue called brown fat that specializes in
generating heat.
Neural Control of Thermoregulation
The nervous system is important to thermoregulation, as illustrated in Figure 24.22. The processes of homeostasis
