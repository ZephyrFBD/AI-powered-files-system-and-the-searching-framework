(LB) and plate 2 containing LB agar with 50 micrograms/mL of the antibiotic ampicillin (LB + amp). Both
plates are incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. Bacteria from plate 1 are plated onto two more plates: one with LB
agar (plate 3) and the other containing LB agar with 50 micrograms/mL of the antibiotic ampicillin (plate 4).
Bacteria from plate 2 are placed onto plate 5 (containing LB agar) and plate 6 (containing LB agar with 250
micrograms/mL of the antibiotic ampicillin). This second round of plates are all incubated at 37°C for 24 hours.
A diagram of the experiment is shown in the figure.
(a) Describe the process of selection used in this experiment.
(b) Make a claim about the presence of bacterial growth on plate 2 and predict the number of colonies
compared to plate 1.
(c) Predict which plate will have bacteria that are more resistant to the antibiotic.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
