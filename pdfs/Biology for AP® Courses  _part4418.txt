the organism they mimic. Many insect species mimic the
coloration of wasps or bees, which are stinging, venomous insects, thereby discouraging predation (Figure 36.23).

with the (a) bumblebee and (b) bee-like robber fly. (credit a, b: modification of work by Cory Zanker)

In MÃ¼llerian mimicry, multiple species share the same warning coloration, but all of them actually have defenses. Figure
36.24 shows a variety of foul-tasting butterflies with similar coloration. In Emsleyan/Mertensian mimicry, a deadly prey
mimics a less dangerous one, such as the venomous coral snake mimicking the non-venomous milk snake. This type of
mimicry is extremely rare and more difficult to understand than the previous two types. For this type of mimicry to w
