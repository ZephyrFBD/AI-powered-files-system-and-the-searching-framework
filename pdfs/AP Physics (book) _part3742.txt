t a Big Bang might have been like.
(Today we usually use the term “Big Bang” to refer to the process, starting from
a moment after the birth of the universe through the subsequent expansion.) The
temperature must have been extremely high at the start, so high that there could
not have been any atoms in the very early stages of the universe (high energy
collisions would have broken atoms apart into nuclei and free electrons). Instead,
the universe would have consisted solely of radiation (photons) and a plasma of
charged electrons and other elementary particles. The universe would have been

opaque—the photons in a sense “trapped,” traveling very short distances before
being scattered again, primarily by electrons. Indeed, the details of the microwave
background radiation provide strong evidence that matter and radiation were once in
equilibrium at a very high temperature. As the universe expanded, the energy spread
out over an increasingly larger volume and the te
