Lab Time 
Both the teacher and the student manuals are free 
and available on the College Board website. Though 
this lab manual isn’t required, it includes laboratory 
investigations that teachers can choose from to satisfy 
the guided inquiry lab component for the course. Some 
textbook publishers may provide a lab manual as an 
ancillary to the textbook, and most science classroom 
supply companies also offer lab manuals. 
It is critical that lab work be an important part of an AP 
Biology course so that it is comparable to a college level 
course for biology majors. Data show that increased 
lab time is correlated with higher AP scores. Flexible 
or modular scheduling may be implemented in order 
to meet the time requirements identified in the course 
outline for lab and field experiences. You may find that 
at minimum, one double period a week is needed to 
allow adequate time for authentic lab experiences.
