duced by slow evolution of intermediate species.
ii. Punctuated Equilibrium—speciation occurs quickly at first and then is followed by small changes
over a long period.
On the AP® exam, the definition of “species” is used in many questions. If asked to ascertain whether two organisms are from
the same species, you must be able to determine whether they can mate and produce fertile offspring.
E. Modes of Natural Selection—natural selection can favor the allelic frequency in three ways. Below
is an example of a bell curve or normal distribution of variations in a population. Three types of
selections can take place that shift the bell curve to different frequencies (hence, evolution is taking
place).
There may be easy mathematical calculations on the AP® Biology test. For example, you should know how to apply the Hardy-
Weinberg equation: p + q = 1, p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1. Also make sure you understand how to use the chi-square equation—don’t
memorize it. If needed, it will be provided:
