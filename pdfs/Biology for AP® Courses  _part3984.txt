that have engulfed and presented pathogen-derived antigens. B cells differentiate
into plasma cells that secrete antibodies, whereas CTLs induce apoptosis in intracellularly infected or cancerous cells.
Memory cells persist after a primary exposure to a pathogen. If re-exposure occurs, memory cells differentiate into effector
cells without input from the innate immune system. The mucosal immune system is largely independent from the systemic
immune system but functions in a parallel fashion to protect the extensive mucosal surfaces of the body.
33.3 Antibodies
Antibodies (immunoglobulins) are the molecules secreted from plasma cells that mediate the humoral immune response.
There are five antibody classes; an antibody's class determines its mechanism of action and production site but does not
control its binding specificity. Antibodies bind antigens via variable domains and can either neutralize pathogens or mark
them for phagocytosis or activate the complement cascade.
