 18.0 
amu, so the mass of 1 mol of H2O is 18.0 g. That is, the molar mass of 
H2O is 18.0 g>mol.
EMPIRICAL FORMULAS FROM ANALYSIS (SECTION 3.5) The em-
pirical formula of any substance can be determined from its percent 
composition by calculating the relative number of moles of each 
atom in 100 g of the substance. If the substance is molecular in na-
ture, its molecular formula can be determined from the empirical 
formula if the molecular weight is also known. Combustion analysis 
is a special technique for determining the empirical formulas of com-
pounds containing only carbon, hydrogen, and/or oxygen.
QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION FROM BALANCED EQUATIONS 
AND LIMITING REACTANTS (SECTIONS 3.6  AND 3.7) The mole 
concept can be used to calculate the relative quantities of reactants 
and products in chemical reactions. The coefficients in a balanced 
equation give the relative numbers of moles of the reactants and 
products. To calculate the number of grams of a product from the 
number
