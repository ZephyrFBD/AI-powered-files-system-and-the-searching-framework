mber. Ruminants
and pseudo-ruminants consume a large amount of plant
material and have polygastric digestive systems, which
means they have more than one stomach chamber. Why is
an increased number of stomach chambers beneficial for
ruminants and pseudo-ruminants?
a.
Microbes in the chambers break down and
ferment plant material.
b.
Extended exposure to stomach acid breaks down
more cellulose.
c.
Increased amounts of peristalsis crush more of
the plant fibers.
d.
Having more stomach chambers increases
exposure for nutrients to be absorbed.

of two organisms that consume different food sources. a.

you determine this?

a.
a. The digestive tract shown at the bottom
belongs to the herbivore. b. Herbivores have a
shorter intestinal tract, which allows stronger
smooth muscle contractions called peristalsis in
a shorter
