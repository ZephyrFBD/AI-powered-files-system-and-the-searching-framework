 say, “I accept the null hypothesis.”
You either “reject it” or “fail to reject it.”) I would reject the
null hypothesis for Visit 2, however, because there was a
statistical difference: memory was improved by exercising
before participating in the memory task.
Water potential (ψ) is the tendency of water to move across a
permeable membrane into a solution. It results from two factors:
solute concentration and pressure. If a cell is surrounded by a
hypertonic solution, water will tend to leave the cell because
water flows from higher water potential to lower water potential
(toward the higher solute), and the cell will shrink. If the cell is
surrounded by a hypotonic solution, water will tend to flow into
the cell and cause it to swell or burst.
I would create the following experiment. First, I would tear off
a thin piece of healthy elodea tissue and prepare a wet mount of
it.
