racil molecule (U). Near the top left in Fig. 29–13, a C has just been added to
the growing m-RNA chain in much the same way that DNA replicates
(Fig. 16–40); and an A, attracted and held close to the T on the DNA chain by the
electrostatic force, will soon be attached to the C by an enzyme. The order of
the bases, and thus the genetic information, is preserved in the m-RNA because
the shapes of the molecules only allow the “proper” one to get close enough so the
electrostatic force can act to form weak bonds.
Next, the m-RNA is buffeted about in the cell (recall kinetic theory, Chapter 13)
until it gets close to a tiny organelle known as a ribosome, to which it can attach
by electrostatic attraction (on the right in Fig.29–13), because their shapes allow the
charged parts to get close enough to form weak bonds. (Recall that force
decreases greatly with separation distance.) Also held by the electrostatic force
to the ribosome are one or two transfer-RNA (t-RNA) molecules. These t-RNA
