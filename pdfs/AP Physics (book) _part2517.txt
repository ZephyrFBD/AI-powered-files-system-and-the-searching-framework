p edge of the mirror only needs to
reach point F, which is 5 cm below the top of her head (half of
).
Thus,
and the mirror needs to have a vertical height of only
And the mirror’s bottom edge must be 0.75 m
above the floor.
NOTE We see that a mirror, if positioned at the correct height (as in Fig. 23–8),
need be only half as tall as a person for that person to be able to see all of himself
or herself.
(1.55 m - 0.75 m) = 0.80 m.
DF = 1.55 m,
GE = 10 cm
BD = 0.75 m.
AE = 1.60 m - 0.10 m = 1.50 m,
