Breaking the piano wire. The steel piano
wire we discussed in Example 9–10 was 1.60 m long with a diameter of 0.20 cm.
Approximately what tension force would break it?
APPROACH We set the tensile stress 
equal to the tensile strength of steel
given in Table 9–2.
SOLUTION The wire’s area is
where
Table 9–2 tells us
so the wire would likely break if the force exceeded
As can be seen in Table 9–2, concrete (like stone and brick) is reasonably
strong under compression but extremely weak under tension. Thus concrete 
can be used as vertical columns placed under compression, but is of little 
value as a beam because it cannot withstand the tensile forces that result 
from the inevitable sagging of the lower edge of a beam (see Fig. 9–25).
