 time. People just cry and moan with the grief and they think they’re 
 
 excused from the tip.They’ll ask you if you’d like to come in for a look 
 
 at the departed and a prayer by the bed.That wouldn’t be so bad if they 
 
 offered you a drop of sherry and a ham sandwich.Oh,no, they’re happy

 shoulders shake like one collapsing with sorrow, hold on to the bed 
 
 with your two hands as if they’re going to have to tea
