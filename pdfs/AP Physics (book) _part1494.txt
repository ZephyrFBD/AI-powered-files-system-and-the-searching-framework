Compare this “speed” to its rms (thermal)
speed. The molecular mass of glycine is about 75 u.

interior through tiny tubes called tracheae. An average
trachea is about 2 mm long and has cross-sectional area of
Assuming the concentration of oxygen inside
is half what it is outside in the atmosphere, (a) show that
the concentration of oxygen in the air (assume 21% is
oxygen) at 20°C is about

diffusion rate J, and (c) estimate the average time for a
molecule to diffuse in. Assume the diffusion constant is
