he Lewis 
structure for naphthalene and the average bond enthalpies 
in Table 8.3, estimate the heat of combustion of naphtha-
lene in kJ>mol. (e) Benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene 
are colorless, but tetracene is orange. What does this imply 
about the relative HOMO–LUMO energy gaps in these mol-
ecules? See the “Chemistry Put to Work” box on orbitals 
and energy.
 
[9.121]  Antibonding molecular orbitals can be used to make bonds 
to other atoms in a molecule. For example, metal atoms 
can use appropriate d orbitals to overlap with the p*
2p or-
bitals of the carbon monoxide molecule. This is called 
d@p backbonding. (a) Draw a coordinate axis system in 
which the y-axis is vertical in the plane of the paper and 
the x-axis horizontal. Write “M” at the origin to denote a 
metal atom. (b) Now, on the x-axis to the right of M, draw 
the Lewis structure of a CO molecule, with the carbon 
nearest the M. The CO bond axis should be on the x-axis. 
(c) Draw the CO p*
2p orbital, with pha
