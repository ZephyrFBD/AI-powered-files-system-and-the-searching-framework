Assuming the same level of continuous activ-
ity as in the research, will the cockroach consume more than 
20% of the available O2 in a 48-hr period? (Air is 21 mol % O2.)

CHAPTER 10 Gases
 10.46  The physical fitness of athletes is measured by “VO2 max,” 
which is the maximum volume of oxygen consumed by an 
individual during incremental exercise (for example, on a 
treadmill). An average male has a VO2 max of 45 mL O2>kg 
body mass/min, but a world-class male athlete can have a VO2 
max reading of 88.0 mL O2>kg body mass/min. (a) Calculate 
the volume of oxygen, in mL, consumed in 1 hr by an aver-
age man who weighs 185 lbs and has a VO2 max reading of 47.5 
mL O2>kg body mass/min. (b) If this man lost 20 lb, exercised, 
and increased his VO2 max to 65.0 mL O2>kg body mass/min, 
how many mL of oxygen would he consume in 1 hr?
