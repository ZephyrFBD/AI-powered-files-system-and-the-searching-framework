 In fact, finishing the test is the worst
thing you can do. Before we explain why, let’s talk about timing.
One of the main reasons that taking the AP Biology Exam can be so stressful is the time constraint we discussed
earlier—90 seconds per multiple-choice question, 25 minutes per long essay, and 10 minutes per short essay. If you
had all day, you would probably ace the test. We can’t give you all day, but we can do the next best thing: we can
give you more time for each question. How? By having you slow down and answer fewer questions.
Slowing down and doing well on the questions you do answer is the best way to improve your score on the AP
Biology Exam. Rushing through questions in order to finish, on the other hand, will always hurt your score. When
you rush, you’re far more likely to make careless errors, misread, and fall into traps. Keep in mind that blank
answers are not counted against you.
