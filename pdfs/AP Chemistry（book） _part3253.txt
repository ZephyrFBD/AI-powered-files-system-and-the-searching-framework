 commercial hybrid vehicles, such as 
the Toyota Prius.
Fully electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids use Li-ion batteries 
because they offer the highest energy density of all commercially 
available batteries. As Li-ion battery technology has advanced, 
these batteries have started to displace the nickelâ€“metal hydride 
batteries used in hybrid electric cars. Concern over safety is one 
factor that has delayed implementation of Li-ion batteries in 
commercial automobiles. In rare cases overheating and/or over-
charging can cause Li-ion batteries to combust 
 (Section 7.3). 
Most electric vehicles now use Li-ion batteries where the LiCoO2 
cathode has been replaced by a cathode made from lithium man-
ganese spinel 1LiMn2O42. Batteries made with LiMn2O4 cathodes 
have several advantages. They are not prone to thermal runaway 
events that can lead to combustion, they tend to have longer life-
times, and manganese is less expensive and more environmentally 
friendly than cobalt. However, th
