The
transfer of energy in the form of electrons allows the cell to transfer and use energy in an incremental fashionâ€”in small
packages rather than in a single, destructive burst. This chapter focuses on the extraction of energy from food; you will see
that as you track the path of the transfers, you are tracking the path of electrons moving through metabolic pathways.
Electron Carriers
In living systems, a small class of compounds functions as electron shuttles: They bind and carry high-energy electrons
between compounds in pathways. The principal electron carriers we will consider are derived from the B vitamin group
and are derivatives of nucleotides. These compounds can be easily reduced (that is, they accept electrons) or oxidized (they
lose electrons). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) (Figure 7.2) is derived from vitamin B3, niacin. NAD+ is the
oxidized form of the molecule; NADH is the reduced form of the molecule after it has accepted two electrons and a proton
(which tog
