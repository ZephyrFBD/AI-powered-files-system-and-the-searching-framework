e in the results? In the example above, a student could ask, How 
many tomatoes do I need to use? What kind of container? Is the size of the container 
important? How will I know if the tomatoes ripen faster? 
•  Variables: What variables are being controlled? Many students know that controls 
are necessary, but they do not really understand how to allow the manipulation of 
just one variable at a time. Probe more deeply as to which variable is being controlled 
and how. For example, in this investigation questions could be Do I need to control for 
mass of the tomatoes, or volume of containers, or both? How? 
•  Data collection: Provide sample data, if needed, and ask what the data mean and how 
the results support an answer(s) to the question posed. 
•  Claims and evidence: Students should make and justify claims about unnatural 
phenomena based on evidence produced through reasoning and scientific practices. 
After the lab, explore with students the results of their investigation. D
