 
the physical properties of polymers.
 12.9  ▶ Nanomaterials Explore how the 
physical and chemical properties of 
materials change when their crystals 
become very small. These effects begin 
to occur when materials have sizes on the 
order of 1–100 nm. Learn about lower-
dimensional forms of carbon—fullerenes, 
carbon nanotubes, and graphene.
What’S ahead
Modern devices like computers 
and cell phones are built from solids with very 
specific physical properties. For example, the 
integrated circuit that is at the heart of many 
electronic devices is built from semiconductors 
like silicon, metals like copper, and insulators like 
hafnium oxide.
Scientists and engineers turn almost exclusively to solids for materi-
als used in many other technologies: alloys for magnets and airplane 
turbines, semiconductors for solar cells and light-emitting diodes, and 
polymers for packaging and biomedical  
applications. Chemists have con-
tributed to the discovery and development of new materia
