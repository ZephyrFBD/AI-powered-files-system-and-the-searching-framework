neuron less likely to fire an action potential.
Once neurotransmission has occurred, the neurotransmitter must be removed from the synaptic cleft so the postsynaptic
membrane can “reset” and be ready to receive another signal. This can be accomplished in three ways: the neurotransmitter
can diffuse away from the synaptic cleft, it can be degraded by enzymes in the synaptic cleft, or it can be recycled
(sometimes called reuptake) by the presynaptic neuron. Several drugs act at this step of neurotransmission. For example,
some drugs that are given to Alzheimer’s patients work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that degrades
acetylcholine. This inhibition of the enzyme essentially increases neurotransmission at synapses that release acetylcholine.
Once released, the acetylcholine stays in the cleft and can continually bind and unbind to postsynaptic receptors.
