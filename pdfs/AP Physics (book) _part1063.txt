is given by the area of a typical capillary multiplied by the
total number N of capillaries.
SOLUTION Let 
be the area of the aorta and 
be the area of all the capil-
laries through which blood flows. Then
where
is the estimated average radius of one capillary. From the equation of continuity
(Eq. 10–4b), we have
so

ESTIMATE
Heating duct to a room. What area must a heating duct
have if air moving 
along it can replenish the air every 15 minutes in a
room of volume 
Assume the air’s density remains constant.
APPROACH We apply the equation of continuity at constant density, Eq. 10–4b,
to the air that flows through the duct (point 1 in Fig. 10–21) and then into the
room (point 2). The volume flow rate in the room equals the
