Cytotechnologists (cyto- = “cell”) are professionals who study cells via microscopic examinations and other
laboratory tests. They are trained to determine which cellular changes are within normal limits and which
are abnormal. Their focus is not limited to cervical cells; they study cellular specimens that come from all
organs. When they notice abnormalities, they consult a pathologist, who is a medical doctor who can make
a clinical diagnosis.
Cytotechnologists play a vital role in saving people’s lives. When abnormalities are discovered early, a
patient’s treatment can begin sooner, which usually increases the chances of a successful outcome.

infected cells are larger; also, two of these cells each have two nuclei instead of one, the normal number. (credi
