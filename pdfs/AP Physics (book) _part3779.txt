able that every effort is being made to extract all of the information it contains.
A new generation of ground, balloon, and satellite experiments is observing the
CMB with greater resolution and sensitivity. They may detect interaction of
gravity waves (produced in the inflationary epoch) with the CMB and thereby
provide direct evidence for cosmic inflation, and also provide information about
elementary particle physics at energies far beyond the reach of man-made
accelerators and colliders.

When we look up into the night sky, we see stars; and with the best telescopes, we
see galaxies and the exotic objects we discussed earlier, including rare supernovae.
But even with our best instruments we do not see the processes going on inside
stars and supernovae that we hypothesized (and believe). We are dependent on
brilliant theorists who come up with viable theories and verifiable models. We
depend on complicated computer models whose parameters are vari
