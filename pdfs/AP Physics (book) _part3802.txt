48. (a) What temperature would correspond to 14-TeV colli-
sions at the LHC? (b) To what era in cosmological history
does this correspond? [Hint: See Fig. 33–29.]
49. In the later stages of stellar evolution, a star (if massive
enough) will begin fusing carbon nuclei to form, for
example, magnesium:
(a) How much energy is released in this reaction (see
Appendix B)? (b) How much kinetic energy must each
carbon nucleus have (assume equal) in a head-on collision
if they are just to “touch” (use Eq. 30–1) so that the strong
force can come into play? (c) What temperature does this
kinetic energy correspond to?
