Interconverting Masses and Moles
Conversions of mass to moles and of moles to mass are frequently encountered in cal-
culations using the mole concept. These calculations are simplified using dimensional 
analysis 
 (Section 1.7), as shown in Sample Exercises 3.10 and 3.11.
 
 
Sample Exercise 3.9 
Calculating Molar Mass
Sample Exercise 3.10
Converting Grams to Moles
What is the molar mass of glucose, C6H12O6?
Calculate the number of moles of glucose (C6H12O6) in a 5.380 g sample.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
A sample of an ionic compound containing iron and chlorine 
is analyzed and found to have a molar mass of 126.8 g>mol. 
What is the charge of the iron in this compound? 
(a) 1+ (b) 2+ (c) 3+ (d) 4+
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Calculate the molar mass of Ca1NO322.
