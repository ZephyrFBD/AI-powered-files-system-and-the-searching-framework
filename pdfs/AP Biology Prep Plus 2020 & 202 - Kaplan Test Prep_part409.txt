n electron and is then oxidized when it passes it on to the next
carrier.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Note that the electron transport chain (ETC) is like an assembly
line where the majority of ATP is generated.
The last carrier of the ETC, cytochrome a3, passes its electron to the final
electron acceptor, O2. In addition to the electrons, O2 picks up a pair of
hydrogen ions from the surrounding medium, forming water.
AP EXPERT NOTE
The names of the specific electron carriers in the electron
transport chain are not required knowledge for the AP Biology
exam.
Electron Transport Chain
Without oxygen, the ETC becomes backlogged with electrons. As a result,
NAD+ cannot be regenerated and glycolysis cannot continue unless lactic
acid fermentation occurs. Likewise, ATP synthesis comes to a halt if
respiratory poisons such as cyanide or dinitrophenol enter the cell.
Cyanide blocks the transfer of electrons from cytochrome a3 to O2.
Dinitrophenol uncouples the electron transport chain from the proton
