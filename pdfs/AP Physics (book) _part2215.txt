20–6 Force between Two Parallel Wires
We have seen that a wire carrying a current produces a magnetic field (magnitude
given by Eq. 20–6 for a long straight wire). Also, a current-carrying wire feels 
a force when placed in a magnetic field (Section 20–3, Eq. 20–1). Thus, we expect
that two current-carrying wires will exert a force on each other.
Consider two long parallel wires separated by a distance d, as in Fig. 20–26a.
They carry currents 
and 
respectively. Each current produces a magnetic field
that is “felt” by the other, so each must exert a force on the other. For example,
the magnetic field 
produced by 
in Fig 20–26 is given by Eq. 20–6, which at
the location of wire 2 points into the page and has magnitude
See Fig. 20–26b, where the field due only to 
is shown. According to Eq. 20–2, the
force

on a length 
of wire 2, carryin
