iology lab, spin your sample, and observe 
if any solids collect at the bottom of the centrifuge tube; large mole-
cules can be separated in this way from a mixture. Measurement of 
the mass of the solid at the bottom of the tube is a way to obtain a 
value for the % solids in milk and also tells you that milk is indeed a 
mixture.
Keep an open mind: Lacking a centrifuge, how else might you 
separate solids in the milk? You could consider using a filter with re-
ally tiny holes in it or perhaps even a fine strainer. You could propose 
that if milk were poured through this filter, some (large) solid com-
ponents should stay on the top of the filter, while water (and really 
small molecules or ions) would pass through the filter. That result 
would be evidence that milk is a mixture. Does such a filter exist? Yes! 
But for our purposes, the existence of such a filter is not the point: 
The point is, can you use your imagination and your knowledge of 
chemistry to design a reasonable expe
