ding to their atomic number and
are arranged in a series of rows and columns based on shared chemical and physical properties. In addition to providing
the atomic number for each element, the periodic table also displays the element’s atomic mass. Looking at carbon, for
example, its symbol (C) and name appear, as well as its atomic number of six (in the upper left-hand corner) and its atomic
mass of 12.11.

Figure 2.5 The periodic table shows the atomic mass and atomic number of each element. The atomic number
appears above the symbol for the element and the approximate atomic mass appears below it.
The periodic table groups elements according to chemical properties. The differences in chemical reactivity between the
elements are based on the number and spatial distribution of an atom’s electrons. Atoms that chemically react and bond
to each other form molecules. Molecules are simply two or more atoms chemically bonded together. Logically,
