rresponds to the reflection of a wave traveling along a cord when it reaches the end. As
we saw in Fig. 11–33, if the end is tied down, the wave changes phase and the pulse flips over, but if
the end is free, no phase shift occurs.

Testing glass for flatness
When white light (rather than monochromatic light) is incident on the thin
wedge of air in Fig. 24–31a or 24–33a, a colorful series of fringes is seen because
constructive interference occurs for different wavelengths in the reflected light at
different thicknesses along the wedge.
A soap bubble (Fig. 24–29a and Chapter-Opening Photo) is a thin spherical
shell (or film) with air inside. The variations in thickness of a soap bubble film give
rise to bright colors reflected from the soap bubble. (There is air on both sides of
the bubble film.) Similar variations in film thickness produce the bright colors seen
reflecting from a thin layer of oil or gasoline on a puddle or lake (Fig. 24–29c).
