A heat engine is a device for changing thermal energy, by
means of heat flow, into useful work.
The efficiency e of a heat engine is defined as the ratio of
the work W done by the engine to the high temperature heat
input 
Because of conservation of energy, the work output
equals 
where 
is the heat exhausted at low tem-
perature to the environment; hence
(15;4)
and W, as defined for heat engines, are positive.
The upper limit on the efficiency (the Carnot efficiency)
can be written in terms of the higher and lower operating 
temperatures (in kelvins) of the engine,
and 
as
(15;5)
Real (irreversible) engines always have an efficiency less than this.
The operation of refrigerators and air conditioners is the
reverse of a heat engine: work is done to extract heat 
from a cool region and exhaust it to a region at a higher temper-
ature. The coefficient of performance (COP) for either is
(15;6a)
where W is the work needed to remove heat 
from the
