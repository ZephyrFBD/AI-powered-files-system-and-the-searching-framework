Outsmart the Tricky Questions
EXCEPT and NOT questions are considered more difficult than other question
types. Here’s where POE comes in handy!
If you don’t remember anything about gametes and gametogenesis, or the production of gametes, this might be a
particularly difficult problem. We’ll see these again later on, but for now, remember that gametes are the sex cells of
sexually reproducing organisms. As such, we know that they are haploid and are produced in the sexual organs. We
also know that they come together to create offspring.
From this very basic review, we know immediately that (A) and (B) are not our answers. Both of these are accurate
statements, so we eliminate them. That leaves us with (C) and (D). If you have no idea what (D) means, focus on
(C). In sexual reproduction, each parent contributes one gamete, or half the genetic complement of the offspring.
