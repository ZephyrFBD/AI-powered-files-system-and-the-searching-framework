B. Mitochondria and chloroplasts have ribosomes that more closely resemble those of bacteria than of eukaryotic
cells.
C. Mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the eukaryotic host cell.
D. Mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria have a single, circular chromosome without histones or proteins.
Questions 26-27 refer to the following:
Mitochondria isolated from cells can be induced to carry out respiration if an appropriate substrate is provided and a
low temperature is maintained to prevent enzyme degradation. The following experiment uses isolated mitoc
