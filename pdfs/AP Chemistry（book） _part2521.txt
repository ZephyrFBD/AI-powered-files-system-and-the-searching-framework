jugate base), and HSO3
-  (base) and H2SO3 (conjugate acid).

▶Practice Exercise 2
When lithium oxide 1Li2O2 is dissolved in water, the solu-
tion turns basic from the reaction of the oxide ion 1O2-2 
with water. Write the equation for this reaction and identify 
the conjugate acid–base pairs.
Relative Strengths of Acids and Bases
Some acids are better proton donors than others, and some bases are better proton 
acceptors than others. If we arrange acids in order of their abilit
