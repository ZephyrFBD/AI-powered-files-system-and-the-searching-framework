Equations 2–6, 2–8, and 2–9 are three of the four most useful equations for
motion at constant acceleration. We now derive the fourth equation, which is useful

in situations where the time is not known. We substitute Eq. 2–8 into Eq. 2–7:
Next we solve Eq. 2–6 for 
obtaining (see Appendix A–4 for a quick review)
