 chain until they reach the final electron acceptor NADP+ to make NADPH.
Photosystem I and photosystem II were numbered in order of their discovery,
not the order they are used in photosynthesis.
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in the thylakoid membranes.
Here is a summary of the most important points from the first part of photosynthesis:
P680 in photosystem II captures light and passes excited electrons down an electron transport chain to produce
ATP.
P700 in photosystem I captures light and passes excited electrons down an electron transport chain to produce
NADPH.
A molecule of water is split by sunlight, releasing electrons, hydrogen, and free O2.
The light-dependent reactions occur in the grana of chloroplasts, where the thylakoids are found. Remember:
the light-absorbing pigments and enzymes for the light-dependent reactions are found within the thylakoids.
Most plants follow this electron flow, which is called linear, or noncyclic. However, some plants (such as C4 p
