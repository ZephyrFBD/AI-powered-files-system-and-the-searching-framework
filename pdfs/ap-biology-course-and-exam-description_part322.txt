11.	 The human TPM1 gene encodes members of the tropomyosin family of 
cytoskeletal proteins. Which of the following best explains how different 
proteins can be made in different cell types from the one TPM1 gene?
(A)	Different introns are selectively converted to exons.
(B)	 Different exons are retained or spliced out of the primary transcript.
(C)	 The GTP cap is selectively added to and activates different exons.
(D)	Different portions of the primary transcript remain bound to the  
template DNA.
12.	 Scientists examined the folded structure of a purified protein resuspended in 
water and found that amino acids with nonpolar R groups were primarily buried 
in the middle of the protein, whereas a
