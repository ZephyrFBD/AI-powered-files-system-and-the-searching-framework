g the general laws that govern chemical reactions. There are two 
basic questions that chemists ask when studying reactions: “How fast 
is the reaction?” and “How far does it proceed?” The first question is 
addressed by chemical kinetics, which we discussed in Chapter 14. 
The second question relates to the equilibrium constant, the focus of 
Chapter 15.
The rate of any reaction is controlled largely by the activation 
energy of the reaction. 
 (Section 14.5) Chemical equilibrium is 
reached when a given reaction and its reverse reaction occur at the 
same rate. 
 (Section 15.1) Because reaction rates depend on activation energy, it is 
logical to expect that equilibrium also depends in some way on energy.
In this chapter, we explore the connection between energy and the extent of 
a reaction. Doing so requires a deeper look at chemical thermodynamics, the area of 
chemistry that deals with energy relationships. We first considered thermodynam-
ics in Chapter 5, where we discussed the
