The function of photolyases, as described in the question stem,
suggests that they would emerge relatively early in evolution, while
cryptochromes would evolve later, most likely in a common ancestor
of plants and animals. The similarities between the two suggest that
cryptochromes may have come about due to mutations in the genes
for photolyases. (C) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because the shared
sequences between the two proteins suggest they are homologous,
sharing a common lineage. (B) is incorrect because there is not
extensive convergence between the functions of photolyases and
cryptochromes. (D) is incorrect because not all light receptor proteins
have identical structures.

Artificial selection is typically used to select for polygenic traits (ones
with multiple genetic influences) that experience a wide range of
variation. The most straightforwa
