proteins, for example, contain the carbon-based group
other elements are needed in only very small quantities and con-
sequently are called trace elements. For example, trace quantities 
of copper are required in the diet of humans to aid in the synthe-

In addition, 23 other elements have been found in 
various living organisms. Five are ions required by all 
organisms: Ca2+, Cl-, Mg2+, K +, and Na +. Calcium ions, 
for example, are necessary for the formation of bone 
and transmission of nervous system signals. Many
