to a change in temperature or a temperature 
interval, we say “Celsius degrees,” as in “2 C°.”) The conversion between the two
temperature scales can be written

Rather than memorizing these relations, it may be simpler to remember that
and that a change of  5 C° = a change of 9 F°.

CHAPTER 13
† The freezing point of a substance is defined as that temperature at which the solid and liquid phases
coexist in equilibrium—that is, without any net liquid changing into the solid or vice versa. Experi-
mentally, this is found to occur at only one definite temperature, for a given pressure. Similarly, the
boiling point is defined as that temperature at which the liquid and gas coexist in equilibrium. Since
these points vary with pressure, the pressure must be specified (usually it is 1 atm).
