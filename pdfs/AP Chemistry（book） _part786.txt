for the reaction in Equation 5.33. The two values are slightly differ-
ent because bond enthalpies are averaged over many compounds, but the use of average 
bond enthalpies provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the actual reaction enthalpy 
change.
It is important to remember that bond enthalpies are derived for gaseous mole-
cules. In solids, liquids, and solutions, intermolecular forces between different mole-
cules must also be taken into account. We will examine the strengths of those forces 
in detail in Chapter 11, but for now it is sufficient to remember that bond enthalpies 
cannot be used to accurately estimate the enthalpies of reactions containing solids, liq-
uids, or solutions.

Most chemical reactions used for the production of heat are combustion reactions. The 
energy released when one gram of any substance is combusted is the fuel value of the 
substance. The fuel value of any food or fuel can be measured by calorimetry.
