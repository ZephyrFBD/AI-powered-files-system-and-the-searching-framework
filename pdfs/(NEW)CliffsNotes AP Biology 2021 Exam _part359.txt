silencing caused by short RNA molecules that bind to complementary
sequences of mRNAs in the cytoplasm and block their translation or cause their degradation (by cleavages). The two
best understood kinds of these molecules are described here:
microRNAs (miRNAs) originate from DNA that is found scattered across the genomeâ€”within introns of protein-
coding genes, in repetitive DNA associated centromeres and telomeres, as well as in genes specific for the miRNA.
A miRNA begins as a larger RNA transcript with double-stranded portions that subsequently undergoes enzymatic
RNA processing in the nucleus and subsequent processing in the cytoplasm and ends as short, single-stranded RNAs
with about 20 nucleotides.
Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are generally generated from dsRNA that originated outside the cell and entered
the cell via double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses or experimentally injected dsRNAs. The biochemical
transformation from dsRNA to short siRNA is similar to the cytoplasmic RNA
