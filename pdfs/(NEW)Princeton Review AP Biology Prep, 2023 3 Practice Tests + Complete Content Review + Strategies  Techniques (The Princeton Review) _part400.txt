, does the reverse. It favors both the extremes and selects against common
traits. For example, females are “selected” to be small and males are “selected” to be large in elephant seals. You’ll
rarely find a female or male of intermediate size.
Another type of selection to be aware of is artificial selection. This is a type of selection where humans directly
affect variation in other species. For example, colors of plants and sizes of dogs are greatly influenced by humans
who are orchestrating breeding to create traits that we desire. This makes these traits selected for even if they are not
increasing the reproductive fitness of a species.
SPECIES
A dog and a bumblebee obviously cannot produce offspring. Therefore, they are different species. However, a
chihuahua and a Great Dane can reproduce (at least in theory). We would not say that they are different species; they
are merely different breeds. In order for these to become different species of dogs, they would have to become
reprod
