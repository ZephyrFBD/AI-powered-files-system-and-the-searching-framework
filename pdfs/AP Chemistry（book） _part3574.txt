rbon (compared with either N or O), 
however, the carbon nonbonding pair is not held as strongly as that on N or O. Conse-
quently, CO is better able to function as a Lewis base than is N2; for example, CO can coor-
dinate its nonbonding pair to the iron of hemoglobin, displacing O2, but N2 cannot.
Carbon monoxide has several commercial uses. Because it burns readily, forming 
CO2, it is employed as a fuel:
 
2 CO1g2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 CO21g2  ∆H° = -566 kJ 
[22.53]
Carbon monoxide is an important reducing agent, widely used in metallurgical opera-
tions to reduce metal oxides, such as the iron oxides:
 
Fe3O41s2 + 4 CO1g2 ¡ 3 Fe1s2 + 4 CO21g2 
[22.54]
Carbon dioxide is produced when carbon-containing substances are burned in excess 
oxygen, such as in this reaction involving ethanol:
 
C2H5OH1l2 + 3 O21g2 ¡ 2 CO21g2 + 3 H2O1g2 
[22.55]
It is also produced when many carbonates are heated:
 
CaCO31s2 ¡
∆
CaO1s2 + CO21g2

The properties of graphite are anisotropic; that is, they differ
