■ Summative Assessment 
1. Review the learning objectives. You can use the learning objectives to generate 
analysis questions. Do the students’ answers to your questions suggest that they 
understand the concepts? 
2. Review students’ experimental evidence. Did students make the appropriate 
measurements and graphs to analyze the data? Were they able to make simple 
volume and surface area calculations? 
3. Have your students prepare laboratory notebooks; keep the first two pages blank for 
a table of contents. Students should record their experimental designs, data, graphs, 
results, and conclusions. They may use Excel to prepare the graphs. 
4. Ask your students to use the principles of osmosis to explain how foods are 
preserved. For example, foods are prepared using high concentrations of salt or 
sugar (e.g., preserves, jams, jellies). The high solute potential in the solution prevents 
microbial growth. 
5. Review water potential with your students; t
