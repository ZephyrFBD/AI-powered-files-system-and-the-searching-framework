the inner radius).
When calculation is difficult, I can be determined experimentally by measuring
the angular acceleration 
about a fixed axis due to a known net torque,
and
applying Newton’s second law,
Eq. 8–14.
8–6 Solving Problems in 
Rotational Dynamics
When working with torque and angular acceleration (Eq. 8–14), it is important to
use a consistent set of units, which in SI is:
in 
in 
and the moment
of inertia, I, in kgm2.
