Any change in the system that leads to an increase in the number of microstates 
1Wfinal 7 Winitial2 leads to a positive value of ∆S:
Entropy increases with the number of microstates of the system.
Let’s consider two modifications to our ideal-gas sample and see how the entropy 
changes in each case. First, suppose we increase the volume of the system, which is anal-
ogous to allowing the gas to expand isothermally. A greater volume means a greater num-
ber of positions available to the gas atoms and therefore a greater number of microstates. 
The entropy therefore increases as the volume increases, as we saw in the “A Closer Look” 
box in Section 19.2.

Second, suppose we keep the volume fixed but increase the temperature. How 
does this change affect the entropy of the system? Recall the distribu
