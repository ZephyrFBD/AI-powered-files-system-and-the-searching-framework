4. (II) A person whose eyes are 1.72 m above the floor stands
2.20 m in front of a vertical plane mirror whose bottom edge
is 38 cm above the floor, Fig. 23–53. What is the horizontal
distance x to the base of the wall supporting the mirror of
the nearest point on the floor
that can be seen reflected in
the mirror?

5. (II) Stand up two plane mirrors so they form a 90.0° angle
as in Fig. 23–54. When you
look into this double mirror,
you see yourself as others
see you, instead of reversed
