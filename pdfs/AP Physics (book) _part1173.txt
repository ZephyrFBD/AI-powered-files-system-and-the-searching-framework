shows a typical graph of
the displacement as a function of time. This is called damped harmonic motion. The
damping† is generally due to the resistance of air and to internal friction within the
oscillating system. The energy that is dissipated to thermal energy results in a
decreased amplitude of oscillation.
Since natural oscillating systems are damped in general, why do we even talk
about (undamped) simple harmonic motion? The answer is that SHM is much
easier to deal with mathematically. And if the damping is not large, the oscillations
can be thought of as simple harmonic motion on which the damping is super-
posed, as represented by the dashed curves in Fig. 11–14. Although damping
does alter the frequency of vibration, the effect can be small if the damping is
small; then Eqs. 11–6 can still be useful approximations.
Sometimes the damping is so large, however, that the motion no longer resem-
bles simple harmonic motion. Three common cases of heavily damped systems are
shown in
