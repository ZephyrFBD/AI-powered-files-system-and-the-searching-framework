 trees 
and cladograms.
iii.	 The out-group represents the lineage that 
is least closely related to the remainder of 
the organisms in the phylogenetic tree or 
cladogram.
c.	Molecular data typically provide more 
accurate and reliable evidence than 
morphological traits in the construction of 
phylogenetic trees or cladograms.
