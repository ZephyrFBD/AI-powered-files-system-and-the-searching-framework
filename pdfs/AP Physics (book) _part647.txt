hrough a distance d. If the direction of a constant force 
makes an angle with the direction of motion, the work done
by this force is

Energy can be defined as the ability to do work. In SI units,
work and energy are measured in joules
Kinetic energy (KE) is energy of motion. An object of
mass m and speed v has translational kinetic energy
(6;3)
The work-energy principle states that the net work done on
an object (by the net force) equals the change in kinetic energy
of that object:
(6;4)
Potential energy (PE) is energy associated with forces that
depend on the position or configuration of objects. Gravitational
potential energy is
(6;6)
where y is the height of the object of mass m above an arbitrary
reference point. Elastic potential energy is given by
