ver, the chemical reactions release enough heat to continue the burning process, supplying the activation energy
for surrounding fuel molecules. Like these reactions outside of cells, the activation energy for most cellular reactions is
too high for heat energy to overcome at efficient rates. In other words, in order for important cellular reactions to occur
at appreciable rates (number of reactions per unit time), their activation energies must be lowered (Figure 6.10); this is
referred to as catalysis. This is a very good thing as far as living cells are concerned. Important macromolecules, such
as proteins, DNA, and RNA, store considerable energy, and their breakdown is exergonic. If cellular temperatures alone
provided enough heat energy for these exergonic reactions to overcome their activation barriers, the essential components
of a cell would disintegrate.
