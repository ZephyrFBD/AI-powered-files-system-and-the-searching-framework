 hybrid electric vehicles and fully electric vehicles are commer-
cially available. Hybrid electric vehicles can be powered either by 
electricity from batteries or by a conventional combustion engine, 
while fully electric vehicles are powered exclusively by the batter-
ies (Figure 20.22). Hybrid electric vehicles can be further divided 
into plug-in hybrids, which require the owner to charge the battery 
by plugging it into a conventional outlet, or regular hybrids, which 
use regenerative braking and power from the combustion engine to 
charge the batteries.
Among the many technological advances needed to make elec-
tric vehicles practical, none is more important than advances in 
battery technology. Batteries for electric vehicles must have a high 
specific energy density, to reduce the weight of the car, as well as 
a high volumetric energy density, to minimize the space needed 
for the battery pack. A plot of energy densities for various types 
of rechargeable batteries is shown
