9. (II) An electron and a 140-g baseball are each traveling
measured to a precision of 0.065%. Calculate and
compare the uncertainty in position of each.
10. (II) A radioactive element undergoes an alpha decay with a
lifetime of 
If alpha particles are emitted with 5.5-MeV
kinetic energy, find the percent uncertainty 
in the
particle energy.
11. (II) If an electron’s position can be measured to a pre-
cision of 15 nm, what is the uncertainty in its speed?
Assuming the minimum speed must be at least equal to its
uncertainty, what is the electron’s minimum kinetic energy?
