[least bound electrons] (27;5b)
Many electrons will require more energy than the bare minimum 
to get out
of the metal, and thus the kinetic energy of such electrons will be less than the
maximum.
From these considerations, the photon theory makes the following predictions:
1. An increase in intensity of the light beam means more photons are incident,
so more electrons will be ejected; but since the energy of each photon is not
changed, the maximum kinetic energy of electrons is not changed by an
increase in intensity.
2. If the frequency of the light is increased, the maximum kinetic energy of the
electrons increases linearly, according to Eq. 27–5b. That is,
This relationship is plotted in Fig. 27–7.
3. If the frequency f is less than the “cutoff” frequency 
where 
no
electrons will be ejected, no matter how great the intensity of the light.
These predictions of the photon theory are very different from the predictions
of the wave theory
