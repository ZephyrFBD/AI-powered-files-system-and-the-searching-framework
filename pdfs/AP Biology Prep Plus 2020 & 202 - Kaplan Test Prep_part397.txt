on of green light, which it instead reflects,
making plants appear green. Chlorophyll is used by two complex systems
in the thylakoid membrane, called photosystems I and II. Each
photosystem is a complex assembly of protein and pigments in the

membrane. When photons strike chlorophyll, electrons are excited and
transferred through the photosystems to a reaction center. When
electrons reach the reaction center, the reaction center gives up excited
electrons that enter an electron transport chain, where they are used to
generate chemical energy as either reduced NADPH or ATP.
Two diﬀerent processes occur in the photosystems, cyclic
photophosphorylation and noncyclic photophosphorylation. Both are used
to generate ATP but in diﬀerent ways. The ATP, in turn, is used to generate
glucose in the dark reactions. Cyclic photophosphorylation occurs in
photosystem I to produce ATP. In the cyclic method, electrons move from
the reaction center, thro
