 caused by a common mechanism: uncontrolled cell growth. Despite the
redundancy and overlapping levels of cell cycle control, errors do occur. One of the critical processes monitored by the
cell cycle checkpoint surveillance mechanism is the proper replication of DNA during the S phase. Even when all of
the cell cycle controls are fully functional, a small percentage of replication errors (mutations) will be passed on to the
daughter cells. If changes to the DNA nucleotide sequence occur within a coding portion of a gene and are not corrected,
a gene mutation results. All cancers start when a gene mutation gives rise to a faulty protein that plays a key role in
cell reproduction. The change in the cell that results from the malformed protein may be minor: perhaps a slight delay in
the binding of Cdk to cyclin or an Rb protein that detaches from its target DNA while still phosphorylated. Even minor
mistakes, however, may allow subsequent mistakes to occur more readily. Over and over, sm
