hic level in another food chain. Humans, for example,
can be primary consumers when eating vegetables but are tertiary
consumers when eating a steak. Here are two sample food chains, each
with four trophic levels:
Producers → Primary Consumers → Secondary Consumers →
Tertiary Consumers
Terrestrial Food Chain
Green Plant → Grasshopper → Frog → Hawk
Marine Food Chain
Phytoplankton → Zooplankton → Small Fish → Shark
Producers
✓ Autotrophs
✓ Green plants
✓ Convert light energy to chemical bond energy
✓ Have the greatest biomass of any trophic level
✓ Examples: diatoms and phytoplankton
Primary consumers
✓ Heterotrophs
✓ Herbivores
✓ Eat the producers
✓ Examples: grasshoppers, zooplankton
Secondary consumers
✓ Heterotrophs
✓ Carnivores
✓ Eat the primary consumers
✓ Examples: frogs, small fish
Tertiary consumers
✓ Heterotrophs
✓ Carnivores
