 called greenhouse gases.
Water vapor makes the largest contribution to the greenhouse effect. The partial 
pressure of water vapor in the atmosphere varies greatly from place to place and time 
to time but is generally highest near Earthâ€™s surface and drops off with increasing eleva-
tion. Because water vapor absorbs infrared radiation so strongly, it plays the major role in 
maintaining the atmospheric temperature at night, when the surface is emitting radia-
tion into space and not receiving energy from the Sun. In very dry desert climates, where 
the water-vapor concentration is low, it may be extremely hot during the day but very 
cold at night. In the absence of a layer of water vapor to absorb and then radiate part of 
the infrared radiation back to Earth, the surface loses this radiation into space and cools 
off very rapidly.
Carbon dioxide plays a secondary but very important role in maintaining the sur-
face temperature. The worldwide combustion of fossil fuels, principally
