9–1 The Conditions for Equilibrium
Objects in daily life have at least one force acting on them (gravity). If they are at
rest, then there must be other forces acting on them as well so that the net force is
zero. A book at rest on a table, for example, has two forces acting on it, the
downward force of gravity and the normal force the table exerts upward on it
(Fig. 9–2). Because the book is at rest, Newton’s second law tells us that the net
force on it is zero. Thus the upward force exerted by the table on the book must
be equal in magnitude to the force of gravity acting downward on the book. Such
an object is said to be in equilibrium (Latin for “equal forces” or “balance”)
under the action of these two forces.
Do not confuse the two forces in Fig. 9–2 with the equal and opposite forces
of Newton’s third law, which act on different objects. In Fig.9–2 , both forces act on the
same object; and the
