that compose
a protein determine the properties of the polymer.
The electric polarity of an amino acid in an aqueous
solution depends on the pH of the solution. Here are three
forms of the general structure of an amino acid.

C. Qualitatively predict the relationship between solution
pH and the form of the amino acid for three solutions of
pH: pH < 7, pH = 7, and pH > 7.

The properties of proteins are determined by interactions
among the amino acids in the peptide-bonded chain. The
protein subcomponents, especially amino R (variable)
groups, can interact with very strong charge-charge forces,
with attractive forces between groups of atoms with
opposite polarities and with repulsive forces between
groups of atoms with the same or no polarity. Attractive
polar forces often arise between molecules through
interactions between oxygen and hydrogen atoms or
between nitrogen and hydrogen atoms.
D. Consider particular orientations of pairs of three
different amino acids.
