dividual rat, urine was collected over a three-hour period after ingestion of 10 mL of 
liquid (water, 1 percent ethyl alcohol solution, or 5 percent ethyl alcohol solution). The volume of urine 
was then measured, and the results were averaged for all individuals within each experimental group. 
The data are shown in the table below.

(a) Pose ONE scientific question that the researchers were most likely investigating with the 
experiment. (1 point) 
Appropriate questions include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
How does alcohol consumption affect urine output in rats (or any mammal)? 
• 
How does alcohol consumption affect regulation of the kidney? 
 
(b) State a hypothesis that could be tested to address the question you posed in part (a). (1 point) 
Appropriate hypotheses include but are not limited to the follow
