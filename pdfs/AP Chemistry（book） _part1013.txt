oton emitted for each 
transition.
 
 (c)  
Calculate the wavelength of the photon emitted for each 
transition. Do any of these transitions lead to the emis-
sion of visible light? If so which one(s)? [Section 6.3]
 
6.8  Consider a ﬁctitious one-dimensional system with one elec-
tron. The wave function for the electron, drawn below, is 
c1x2 = sin x from x = 0 to x = 2p. (a) Sketch the probabili-
ty density, c21x2, from x = 0 to x = 2p. (b) At what value or 
values of x will there be the greatest probability of ﬁnding the 
electron? (c) What is the probability that the electron will 
be found at x = p? What is such a point in a wave function 
called? [Section 6.5]

6.9  The contour representation 
of one of the orbitals for the 
n = 3 shell of a hydrogen atom 
is shown here. (a) What is the 
quantum number l for this 
orbital? (b) How do we label this 
orbital? (c) In which of the fol-
lowing ways would you modify 
this sketch if the value of the
