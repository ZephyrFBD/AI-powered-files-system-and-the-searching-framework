photosynthetic rates. Biotic factors can also influence photosynthetic rates. Leaf characteristics vary among
individual plants and even vary among leaves of a single plant. A leaf taken from a shady part of a plant may differ
from a sun-exposed leaf by its density of stomata, density and length of leaf hairs, and thickness of cuticle. All these
and other factors influence photosynthetic rates.
In this part of the investigation, you design an experiment to investigate a factor that may influence photosynthetic
rates. Follow the procedure for part I, manipulating (giving different values to) the independent variable you
investigate. For example, if you investigate light intensity, you manipulate the variable by assigning different values
of light intensity.
After collecting the data, graph ET50vs. the independent variable (the
 
variable you are investigating). For some independent variables, such as
 
light intensity, it makes sense to graph 1/ET50vs. light intensity because such
