on that is
starting to decline, so choices (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect.
3. (C)  
 ducks in one year. Since the starting population size is 135 ducks, after one
year, there will be 135 + 10 = 145 ducks.
4. (C)  
. So the average death rate would be 
. The death rate is 
.
5. (B)  Since there is a carrying capacity in this environment, use this equation: 
. Choice (B) is the closest estimate to this number and is
therefore the correct answer.
6. (C) Populations grow exponentially if there are no limiting resources or predators that would limit the
population size. If the population was limited by density-dependent factors, its growth would be logistic, so
choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because if the size of the population was beyond the carrying
capacity of the environment, its numbers would be declining, not growing. K-selected populations experience
logistic growth, so choice (D) is also incorrect.
7. (C) Since both the ants and the acacia trees benefit from the
