modern world plus all the toxic food and drink are causing this to
happen more than ever. Deluded ‘scientists’ misread this as a
gathering impact of what they wrongly label ‘viruses’.
Paper can infect houses
Cowan said in an article for davidicke.com – with his tongue only
mildly in his cheek – that he believed he had made a tremendous
discovery that may revolutionise science. He had discovered that
small bits of paper are alive, ‘well alive-ish’, can ‘infect’ houses, and
then reproduce themselves inside the house. The result was that this
explosion of growth in the paper inside the house causes the house
to explode, blowing it to smithereens. His evidence for this new
