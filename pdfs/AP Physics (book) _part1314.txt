FIGURE 12–17 Sound waves of a
single frequency from loudspeakers
A and B (see Fig. 12–16)
constructively interfere at C and
destructively interfere at D. [Shown
here are graphical representations,
not the actual longitudinal sound
waves.]
Loudspeakers’ interference. Two loudspeakers are 1.00 m
apart. A person stands 4.00 m from one speaker. How far should this person be
from the second speaker to detect destructive interference when the speakers
emit an 1150-Hz sound? Assume the temperature is 20°C.
APPROACH To sense destructive interference, the person should be one-half 
wavelength closer to or farther from one speaker than from the other—that is,
at a
We can determine because we know f and v.
SOLUTION The speed of sound at 20°C is 
so the wavelength of this
sound is (Eq. 11–12)
For destructive int
