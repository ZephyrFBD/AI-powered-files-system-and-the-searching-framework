nt chemistries (such as acidic versus basic, or polar and nonpolar)
and different structural constraints. Variation in amino acid sequence gives rise to enormous variation in protein structure
and function.
Figure 15.2 Structures of the 20 amino acids found in proteins are shown. Each amino acid is composed of an amino
group ( NH3
+ ), a carboxyl group (COO-), and a side chain (blue). The side chain may be nonpolar, polar, or charged,
as well as large or small. It is the variety of amino acid side chains that gives rise to the incredible variation of protein
structure and function.

The Central Dogma: DNA Encodes RNA; RNA Encodes Protein
The flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the Central Dogma (Figure 15.3),
which states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs, which in turn specify the sequence of proteins. The decoding of
one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and RNAs. Because the in
