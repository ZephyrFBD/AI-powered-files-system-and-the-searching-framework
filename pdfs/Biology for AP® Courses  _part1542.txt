extension of telomeres, reduced DNA damage, reversed neurodegeneration, and improved the function of the testes, spleen,
and intestines. Thus, telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in humans.
Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells. The cells accumulate mutations, proliferate
uncontrollably, and can migrate to different parts of the body through a process called metastasis. Scientists have observed
that cancerous cells have considerably shortened telomeres and that telomerase is active in these cells. Interestingly, only
after the telomeres were shortened in the cancer cells did the telomerase become active. If the action of telomerase
