12 has two signiﬁcant ﬁgures, the pH has two 
decimal places, 12.00.
(b) For the second solution, 3H+4 = 5.6 * 10-6 M. Before per-
forming the calculation, it is helpful to estimate the pH. To do so, 
we note that 3H+4 lies between 1 * 10-6 and 1 * 10-5. Thus, we 
expect the pH to lie between 6.0 and 5.0. We use Equation 16.17 
to calculate the pH:
pH = -log15.6 * 10-62 = 5.25
Check After calculating a pH, it is useful to compare it to your 
estimate. In this case the pH, as we predicted, falls between 6 and 
5. Had the calculated pH and the estimate not agreed, we should 
have reconsidered our calculation or estimate or both.
