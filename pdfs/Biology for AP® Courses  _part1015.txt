 special form of RNA called messenger RNA (mRNA); the cell uses
information in the mRNA (which moves out into the cytoplasm and associates with ribosomes) to link specific amino acids
in the correct order, producing a protein. Internal receptors can directly influence gene expression without having to pass
the signal on to other receptors or messengers.
Figure 9.4 Hydrophobic signaling molecules typically diffuse across the plasma membrane and interact with
intracellular receptors in the cytoplasm. Many intracellular receptors are transcription factors that interact with DNA in
the nucleus and regulate gene expression.
Cell-Surface Receptors
Cell-surface receptors, also known as transmembrane receptors, are cell surface, membrane-anchored (integral) proteins
that bind to external ligand molecules. This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction,
in which an extracellular signal is converted into an intracellular signal. Ligands that interact with cell-s
