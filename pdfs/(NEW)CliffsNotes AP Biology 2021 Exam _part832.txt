generations of reproduction, the frequency of one of
the two alleles in the model became zero.
In two or three sentences, provide an explanation for why an allele would “disappear” after such a short number of
reproductive cycles. 3. In a gel electrophoresis procedure, DNA samples are placed on a gel and an electric voltage

Long Question
1. An experiment was conducted to measure the effect of light on photosynthetic rate. The following three
treatments were evaluated:
Treatment I: Healthy chloroplasts exposed to light
Treatment II: Boiled chloroplasts exposed to light
Treatment III: Healthy chloroplasts incubated in darkness
Oxidized DPIP was added to each treatment to simulate NADP+. When
oxidized DPIP is reduced (energized) by photosynthesis, it turns from blue to clear. The degree to which the DPIP
was reduced in each treatment was determined by using a spectrophotometer. A spectrophotomete
