the reactant side of the equation.
The equilibrium constant also allows us to (1) predict the direction in which a reaction 
mixture achieves equilibrium and (2) calculate equilibrium concentrations of reactants 
and products.
Predicting the direction of Reaction
For the formation of NH3 from N2 and H2 (Equation 15.6), Kc = 0.105 at 472 °C. Suppose 
we place 2.00 mol of H2, 1.00 mol of N2, and 2.00 mol of NH3 in a 1.00-L container at 
472 °C. How will the mixture react to reach equilibrium? Will N2 and H2 react to form 
more NH3, or will NH3 decompose to N2 and H2?
To answer this question, we substitute the starting concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3 
into the equilibrium-constant expression and compare its value to the equilibrium constant:
 
3NH342
3N243H243 =
12.0022
11.00212.0023 = 0.500 whereas Kc = 0.105 
[15.23]
To reach equilibrium, the quotient 3NH342>3N243H243 must decrease from the starting 
value of 0.500 to the equilibrium value of 0.105. Because the system is closed, this
