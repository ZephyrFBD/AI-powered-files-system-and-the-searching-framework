melanogaster, by performing several genetic crosses and comparing expected and observed phenotypic
ratios. Virtual labs exploring Mendelian inheritance patterns are also available online.

•
In pea plants, round peas (R) are dominant to wrinkles peas (r) (Figure 12.5). You do a test cross between a pea
plant with wrinkled peas (genotype rr) and a plant of unknown genotype that has round peas (genotype either RR
or Rr). You end up with three offspring plants, all which have round peas. Based on the phenotype of the offspring
plants, can you deduce the genotype of the round pea parent plant? If the round pea parent plant is heterozygous,
calculate the probability that a random sample of 3 progeny peas will all be round.
