50. (II) Roger sees water balloons fall past his window. He
notices that each balloon strikes the sidewalk 0.83 s after
passing his window. Roger’s room is on the third floor, 15 m
above the sidewalk. (a) How fast are the balloons trav-
eling when they pass Roger’s window? (b) Assuming the
balloons are being released from rest, from what floor are
they being released? Each floor of the dorm is 5.0 m high.
51. (II) Suppose you adjust your garden hose nozzle for a fast
stream of water. You point
the nozzle vertically upward at
a height of 1.8 m above the
ground (Fig. 2–40). When you
quickly turn off the nozzle, you
hear the water striking the
ground next to you for another
2.5 s. What is the water speed
as it leaves the nozzle?
