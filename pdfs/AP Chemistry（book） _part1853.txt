passed through a crystal. The diffraction pattern that 
results is recorded. For many years the diffracted X rays were detected 
by photographic ﬁlm. Today, crystallographers use an array detector, a 
device analogous to that used in digital cameras, to capture and mea-
sure the intensities of the diffracted rays.
The pattern of spots on the detector in Figure 12.9 depends on the 
particular arrangement of atoms in the crystal. The spacing and symme-
try of the bright spots, where constructive interference occurs, provide 
information about the size and shape of the unit cell. The intensities 
of the spots provide information that can be used to determine the 
locations of the atoms within the unit cell. When combined, these two 
pieces of information give the atomic structure that deﬁnes the crystal.
X-ray crystallography is used extensively to determine the struc-
tures of molecules in crystals. The instruments used to measure X-ray 
diffraction, known as X-ray diffractometers, are n
