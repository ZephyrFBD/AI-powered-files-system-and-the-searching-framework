That is, we let the interval 
which we now call 
to become smaller and
smaller. The slope of the line connecting the two points becomes closer and
closer to the slope of a line tangent† to the curve at point 
The average
velocity (equal to the slope of the chord) thus approaches the slope of 
the tangent at point 
The definition of the instantaneous velocity (Eq. 2–3) is
the limiting value of the average velocity as 
approaches zero. Thus the
instantaneous velocity equals the slope of the tangent to the curve of x vs.
at any
chosen point (which we can simply call “the slope of the curve” at that point).
