etylcholine release from preganglionic sympathetic fibers innervating the
adrenal medulla. These neural impulses originate from the hypothalamus in response to stress to prepare the body for the
fight-or-flight response.
Pancreas
The pancreas, illustrated in Figure 28.19, is an elongated organ that is located between the stomach and the proximal
portion of the small intestine. It contains both exocrine cells that excrete digestive enzymes and endocrine cells that release

The endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of Langerhans, as visible in the
micrograph shown in Figure 28.20. The pancreatic islets contain two primary cell types: alpha cells, which produce the
hormone glucagon, and beta cells, which pr
