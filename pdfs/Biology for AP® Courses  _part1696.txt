RNA-based enzyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit and catalyzes the formation
of peptide bonds
extrachromosomal, covalently closed, circular DNA molecule that may only contain one or a few genes; common
in prokaryotes
modification added to the 3' end of pre-mRNAs to protect mRNA from degradation and assist mRNA export
from the nucleus
mRNA molecule simultaneously being translated by many ribosomes all going in the same direction
cluster of transcription factors and other proteins that recruit RNA polymerase II for transcription
of a DNA template
DNA sequence to which RNA polymerase and associated factors bind and initiate transcription
sequence of triplet codons in mRNA that specify a particular protein; a ribosome shift of one or two
nucleotides in eit
