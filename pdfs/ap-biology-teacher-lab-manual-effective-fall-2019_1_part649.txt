 For the 
remaining Fast Plants, they should describe the growth over time in their lab notebooks. 
Step 6 On day 14, students repeat Steps 2â€“4 with 14-day-old plants and record their data 
in their lab notebooks (see Table 2).

Estimating Energy Flow Between Fast Plants Producers and 
Cabbage Butterfly Larvae 
Step 1 Students create a diagram to model energy capture and flow through a plant, as in 
Step 1 in the previous procedure. 
Step 2 Students mass one large, fresh brussels sprout. They should cut the sprout in half to 
expose the inner leaves to butterfly larvae and place these sprout halves into the Brassica 
Barn. (Remind them to remove all other plant materials in the Brassica Barn.) Students
