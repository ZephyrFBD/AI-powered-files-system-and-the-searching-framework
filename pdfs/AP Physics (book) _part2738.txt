(III) A very thin sheet of plastic 
covers one slit
of a double-slit apparatus illuminated by 680-nm light. The
center point on the screen, instead of being a maximum, is
dark. What is the (minimum) thickness of the plastic?

18. (I) By what percent is the speed of blue light (450 nm) less
than the speed of red light (680 nm), in silicate flint glass
(see Fig. 24–14)?
19. (II) A light beam strikes a piece of glass at a 65.00° incident
angle. The beam contains two wavelengths, 450.0 nm and
700.0 nm, for which the index of refraction of the glass is
1.4831 and 1.4754, respectively. What is the angle between
the two refracted beams?
20. (III) A parallel beam of light containing two wavelengths,
and 
enters the silicate flint glass
of an equilateral prism as shown in Fig.24–59. At what angles,
does each beam leave the prism (give angle with
normal to the face)?
See Fig. 24–14.
