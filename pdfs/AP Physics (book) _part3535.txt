of biological damage?
40. (I) A dose of 4.0 Sv of 
rays in a short period would be
lethal to about half the people subjected to it. How many
grays is this?
41. (I) How many rads of slow neutrons will do as much bio-
logical damage as 72 rads of fast neutrons?
42. (II) How much energy is deposited in the body of a 65-kg
adult exposed to a 2.5-Gy dose?
43. (II) A cancer patient is undergoing radiation therapy in
which protons with an energy of 1.2 MeV are incident on a
0.20-kg tumor. (a) If the patient receives an effective dose
of 1.0 rem, what is the absorbed dose? (b) How many
protons are absorbed by the tumor? Assume
44. (II) A 0.035-
sample of 
is injected into an animal
for tracer studies. If a Geiger counter intercepts 35% of
the emitted 
particles, what will be the counting rate,
assumed 85% efficient?
