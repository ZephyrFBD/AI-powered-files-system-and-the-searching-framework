 to the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus, in turn,
regulates the release of reproductive hormones that are necessary during
the breeding season. Signals from the hypothalamus travel to the posterior
pituitary and anterior pituitary.
Posterior Pituitary
Two hormones are synthesized in the hypothalamus and reach the
posterior pituitary by hypothalamic axons. These hormones are released
from the posterior pituitary upon receiving nerve impulses from the
hypothalamus. One hormone is oxytocin, which regulates milk secretion
by mammary glands and uterine contractions during labor. In addition,
oxytocin targets the brain, influencing behaviors related to trust, maternal
care, pair bonding, and sexual activity. The other hormone, antidiuretic
hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, targets the nephron and
increases water retention by the kidneys, thus decreasing urine volume.
This regulates blood osmolarity.
Anterior Pituitary
All hormones released by the anterior pituitary are controlled by a
