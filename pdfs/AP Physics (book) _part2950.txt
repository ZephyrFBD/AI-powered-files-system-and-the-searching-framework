relativity a viable theory in that it can predict accurate results at low speed as well
as at high. Indeed, the other equations of special relativity also reduce to their
classical equivalents at ordinary speeds: length contraction, time dilation, and
modifications to momentum as well as kinetic energy, all disappear for
since
A useful relation between the total energy E of a particle and its momentum p
can also be derived. The momentum of a particle of mass m and speed v is given
by Eq. 26–4
The total energy is
or
We square this equation (and we insert “
” which is zero, but will help us):
or
(26–9)
Thus, the total energy can be written in terms of the momentum p, or in terms of
the kinetic energy (Eq.26–6a), where we have assumed there is no potential energy.
Invariant Energy–Momentum
We can rewrite Eq. 26–9 as 
Since the mass m of a given
particle is the same in any reference frame, we see that the quantity
must also be the same in any reference frame. Thus, at any given moment the
