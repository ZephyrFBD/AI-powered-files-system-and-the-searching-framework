r, for students who are simply stuck on how to get started, these pencil-and­
paper simulations can provide good preparation for the computer modeling  
featured here.  
■ Designing and Conducting Independent Investigations 
The most important preparation teachers can do for this laboratory investigation is to 
work through the model building procedure themselves in their home or office. The 
author of this investigation has made this model dozens of times from scratch and 
usually learns something new, thinks of a different way to accomplish a task, or simply 
improves the model with every new build. Each time you work out this model with 
students you develop a richer repertoire of methods to apply to modeling. It is that rich 
environment that produces an authentic learning experience for students — a learning 
experience that transfers generally to a deeper understanding of the Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium and its application in population genetics.
