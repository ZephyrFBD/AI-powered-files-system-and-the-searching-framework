Instructions
Section I of this exam contains 53 multiple-choice questions and 5 grid-in questions.
Indicate all of your answers to the Section I questions on the answer sheet. No credit will
be given for anything written in this exam booklet, but you may use the booklet for notes
or scratch work.
For questions 1–53, after you have decided which of the suggested answers is best,
completely fill in the corresponding circle on the answer sheet. Fill in only the circles for
questions 1–53. Because this section offers only four answer options for each question, do
not mark the (E) answer circle for any question.
Give only one answer to each question. If you change an answer, be sure that the previous
mark is erased completely. Here is a sample question and answer.
DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOKLET UNTIL YOU ARE TOLD TO DO SO.
