decision was made to 
build a bomb based on the ﬁssion reaction. An enormous research 
project, known as the Manhattan Project, began.
On December 2, 1942, the ﬁrst artiﬁcial self-sustaining nuclear 
ﬁssion chain reaction was achieved in an abandoned squash court at 
the University of Chicago. This accomplishment led to the develop-
ment of the ﬁrst atomic bomb, at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 
New Mexico in July 1945 (Figure 21.18). In August 1945 the United 
States dropped atomic bombs on two Japanese cities, Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki. The nuclear age had arrived, albeit in a sadly destruc-
tive fashion. Humanity has struggled with the conﬂict between the 
positive potential of nuclear energy and its terrifying potential as a 
weapon ever since.
