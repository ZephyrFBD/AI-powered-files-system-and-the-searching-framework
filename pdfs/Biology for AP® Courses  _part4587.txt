. They either clumped food in one
concentrated pile on the table or dispersed the food in a
much wider area under and around the table. They then
observed the number of times an individual in species A
gave a predator warning call when no predator was in sight
as well as the presence or absence of species B at the
feeding table. The data collected by the researchers are
shown here. What do the data suggest about the use of
deception by species A? Explain your reasoning.

a.
Species A uses deception in cases when food is
plentiful, but concentrated, so access is limited
to a small group of birds. A bird that had
restricted access to the food has open access
because of the alarm. Only in cases where itâ€™s
necessary does the bird carry out this deceptive
behavior.
