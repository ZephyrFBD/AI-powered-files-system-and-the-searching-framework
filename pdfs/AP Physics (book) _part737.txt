of only two particles (or small objects), of masses 
and 
We choose a coor-
dinate system so that both particles lie on the x axis at positions 
and 
Fig.7–22.
The center of mass of this system is defined to be at the position 
given by
where
is the total mass of the system. The center of mass lies on
the line joining 
and 
If the two masses are equal
then
is midway between them, because in this case
If one mass is greater than the other, then the CM is closer to the larger mass.
If there are more than two particles along a line, there will be additional terms:
(7;9a)
where M is the total mass of all the particles.
CM of three guys on a raft. On a lightweight (air-filled)
“banana boat,” three people of roughly equal mass m sit along the x axis at posi-
tions
and
measured from the left-hand
end as shown in Fig. 7–23. Find the position of the CM. Ignore the mass of the boat.
APPROACH We are given the mass and location of the three people, so we 
use three terms in Eq. 7–9a. We approximat
