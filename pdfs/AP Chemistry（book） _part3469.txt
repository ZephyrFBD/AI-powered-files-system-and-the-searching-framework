ing nuclei 
are likely to have the largest mass defect per nucleon: 
 
(a) 11B, (b) 51V, (c) 118Sn, (d) 243Cm?
 21.54  The isotope 62
28Ni has the largest binding energy per nucleon 
of any isotope. Calculate this value from the atomic mass 
of nickel-62 (61.928345 amu) and compare it with the 
value given for iron-56 in Table 21.7.

 21.55  Iodine-131 is a convenient radioisotope to monitor thyroid 
activity in humans. It is a beta emitter with a half-life of 
8.02 days. The thyroid is the only gland in the body that 
uses iodine. A person undergoing a test of thyroid activity 
drinks a solution of NaI, in which only a small fraction of 
the iodide is radioactive. (a) Why is NaI a good choice for 
the source of iodine? (b) If a Geiger counter is placed near 
the personâ€™s thyroid (which is near the neck) right after the 
sodium iodide solution is taken, what will the data look 
like as a function of time? (c) A normal thy
