 plants to be
healthy, they need blue and red light, not green.
AP EXPERT NOTE
You may feel overwhelmed by the amount of information on
photosynthesis, but don’t panic. Only the major points are
required for Test Day.
Chloroplasts are found mainly in the mesophyll, the green tissue in the
interior of the plant. The stomata, pores in the leaf’s surface, let CO2 in
and O2 out. The opening and closing of the stomata is controlled by the
guard cells. Inside the chloroplasts, there is stroma (a dense fluid) and
thylakoid sacs (arranged into chlorophyll-containing, pancake-like stacks
called grana).
LIGHT REACTIONS
The first part of photosynthesis is made up of light-dependent reactions,
in which light energy is used to generate ATP, oxygen, and the reducing
molecule NADPH. The molecule that captures light energy to start
photosynthesis is a pigment called chlorophyll, found in the thylakoid
membranes of the chloroplast. Chlorophyll absorbs most wavelengths of
visible light, with the excepti
