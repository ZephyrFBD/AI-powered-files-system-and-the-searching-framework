ng of water is embedded on the inner side of the thylakoid
membrane, so the splitting of water occurs there.
10. B. The splitting of H2O provides the electrons for noncyclic
 
photophosphorylation. These electrons are incorporated in NADPH and ultimately find their way into glucose
during the Calvin cycle.
11. B. It could also be light, but that is not an answer choice. You should test yourself on all aspects of this diagram:
Pathway A is noncyclic photophosphorylation, and Pathway B is the Calvin cycle. Arrows 1 and
2: H2O and light; arrow 3: ADP; arrows 4 and 5: ATP and NADPH; arrow 6: O2; and arrow 7: CO2.
 
12. B. ADP is recycled. ADP is used in photophosphorylation to produce ATP. In the Calvin cycle (Pathway B), the
energy in ATP is used,
 
releasing ADP and Pi. The answer could also be NADP+, but that choice is not given (and, besides, NADP+ is
already shown in the
 
figure).
 
13. A. It could also be ATP, but that is not an answer choice.
 
14. D. Arrow 7 represents CO2, which
