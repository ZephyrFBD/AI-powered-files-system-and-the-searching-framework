15–5 Heat Engines
18. (I) A heat engine exhausts 8200 J of heat while performing
2600 J of useful work. What is the efficiency of this engine?
19. (I) What is the maximum efficiency of a heat engine whose
operating temperatures are 560°C and 345°C?

23. (II) Which will improve the efficiency of a Carnot engine
more: a 10 C° increase in the high-temperature reservoir, or a
10 C° decrease in the low-temperature reservoir? Give
detailed results. Can you state a generalization?
24. (II) A certain power plant puts out 580 MW of electric
power. Estimate the heat discharged per second, assuming
that the plant has an efficiency of 32%.
25. (II) A nuclear power plant operates at 65% of its maximum
theoretical (Carnot) efficiency between temperatures of 660°C
and 330°C. If the plant produces electric energy at the rate
of 1.4 GW, how much exhaust heat is discharged per
