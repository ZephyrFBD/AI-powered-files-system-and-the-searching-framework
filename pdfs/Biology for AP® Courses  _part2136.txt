 a new
population in a new location or gets separated by a physical barrier of some kind. In this situation, those individuals are
unlikely to be representative of the entire population, a phenomenon called the founder effect. Both the bottleneck effect
and the founder effect reduce genetic variation within a population—and genetic variation is the basis for natural selection.
When individuals leave or join a population, they carry their alleles with them, resulting in changes in the population’s
allele frequencies. Allele frequencies also can change due to mutation in DNA and when individuals do not randomly mate
with others; when an individual selects a mate based on phenotype, the genotype is also selected. In summary, any of these
conditions can result in deviations from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium—and lead to the microevolution of a population.
