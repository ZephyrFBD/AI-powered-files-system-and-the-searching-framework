h of the 20 amino acids. This
variable group can be a single hydrogen atom or a group of many atoms sometimes including sulfur, nitrogen, or
carbon rings. The individual amino acids in a protein interact with one another, giving the protein special spatial and
functional characteristics. These characteristics impart to an enzyme unique attributes that allow it to catalyze
specific reactions of specific substrates. The characteristics of proteins (and, therefore, enzymes) are derived from
four features of the protein’s structure. The first, described by the primary structure, is the kind and arrangement of
amino acids in the protein. A secondary structure originates from hydrogen bonding between amino and carboxyl
groups of amino acids. This secondary structure is the
threedimensional shape of a helix or a pleated sheet. Further interactions between amino acids give proteins a
tertiary structure. These interactions include hydrogen bonding and ionic bonding between R groups, the “hiding
