 Construct a graph of the Total Enzyme Levels for each of the 3 genes. Be sure to show the results in the
presence and absence of Protein X and Protein Y. (4pts total)
i. Proper data selection/data placement
ii. Proper axes
iii. Proper error bars
iv. Proper labels
c. Analyze the data and describe the influence of Protein X and Protein Y on the gene expression of Enzyme A
and Enzyme B. Include at which point in gene expression the regulation likely occurs. (2pts total)
i. Expression of Enzyme A appears to be stimulated by Protein X and is unaffected by Protein Y. The mRNA,
protein, and enzyme activity increased with Protein X, so the regulation must be pre-transcriptional.
ii. The expression of Enzyme B appears to be inhibited by Protein X (mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity
reduced), so this seems like pre-transcriptional inhibition. The expression of Enzyme B appears to be
stimulated by Protein Y. The mRNA and Protein Levels are the same, but the Enzyme Level is increased.
