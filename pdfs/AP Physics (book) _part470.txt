circle of radius 0.600 m. The ball makes 2.00 revo-
lutions per second  
as in Example 5–1. Ignore the string’s mass.
APPROACH First we need to draw the free-body diagram for the ball. The forces
acting on the ball are the force of gravity,
downward, and the tension force 
that the string exerts toward the hand at the center (which occurs because the
person exerts that same force on the string). The free-body diagram for the ball is
shown in Fig. 5–7. The ball’s weight complicates matters and makes it impos-
sible to revolve a ball with the cord perfectly horizontal. We estimate the force
assuming the weight is small, and letting
in Fig. 5–7. Then 
will act
nearly horizontally and, in any case, provides the force necessary to give the ball
its centripetal acceleration.
SOLUTION We apply Newton’s second law to the radial direction, which we
assume is horizontal:
where  
and  
Thus
NOTE We keep only two significant figures in the answer because we ignored the
ball’s weight; it is  
about
