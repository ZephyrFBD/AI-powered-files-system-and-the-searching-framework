e questions could
lead to modifications of this experiment) include:
What would happen to the enzyme function if you preheated the
enzyme?
What would happen to the enzyme at a different pH?
What would happen to the enzyme function if you exposed the
enzymes to acid before you began the experiment?
Which has a greater effect on the rate of reaction: changing the
concentration of enzymes or changing the concentration of the
substrate?
HOW TO CALCULATE THE RATE OF AN ENZYME-
MEDIATED REACTION
You can calculate the rate of an enzyme-mediated reaction by measuring
either the disappearance of substrate over time or the appearance of
product. Referring to the graph below, see how to calculate the rate of
reaction for the first 20 seconds based on how much product is formed.
Remember that rate = ΔyΔx.

−0 sec=1420=0.70 moles/second of product
