hen we find R from
SOLUTION (a) We solve Eq. 18–9a for the rms current:
Then
The resistance is
The resistance could equally well be calculated using peak values:
(b) When connected to a 240-V line, more current would flow and the resistance
would change with the increased temperature (Section 18–4). But let us make
an estimate of the power transformed based on the same 
resistance.
The average power would be
This is four times the dryer’s power rating and would undoubtedly melt the
heating element or the wire coils of the motor.
This Section has given a brief introduction to the simpler aspects of alternat-
ing currents. We will discuss ac circuits in more detail in Chapter 21. In Chapter 19
we will deal with the details of dc circuits only.
