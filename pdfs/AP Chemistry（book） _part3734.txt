3Co(NH3)643+ a high-spin complex or a 
low-spin complex? (c) Estimate the wavelength where you expect the absorption of light to reach a maximum? (d) What color and 
magnetic behavior would you predict for the complex ion 3Co(en)343+?
Sample Exercise 23.7 
The Spectrochemical Series, Crystal-Field Splitting, Color, and Magnetism
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the color and magnetic behavior of an octa-
hedral complex containing Co with a +3 oxidation number. We 
need to use this information to determine its electron configura-
tion, its spin state (low-spin or high-spin), and the color of light 
it absorbs. In part (d), we must use the spectrochemical series to 
predict how its properties will change if NH3 is replaced by eth-
ylenediamine (en).
Plan (a) From the oxidation number and the periodic table we 
can determine the number of valence electrons for Co(III), and 
from that we can determine the electron configuration. (b) The 
magnetic behavior can be used to determine whether this
