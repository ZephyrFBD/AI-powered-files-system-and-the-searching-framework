is red light in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
12.79 The band gap is approximately 1.85 eV, which corresponds 
to a wavelength of 672 nm. 12.81 (a) A monomer is a small mol-
ecule with low molecular mass that can be joined with other mono-
mers to form a polymer. They are the repeating units of a polymer. 
(b) ethene (also known as ethylene) 12.83 Reasonable values for 
a polymer’s molecular weight are 10,000 amu, 100,000 amu, and 
1,000,000 amu.

If a dicarboxylic acid and a dialcohol are combined, there is the 
potential for propagation of the polymer chain at both ends of both 
monomers.

12.91 (a) Flexibility of the molecular chains causes ﬂexibility of 
the bulk polymer. Flexibility is enhanced by molecular features 
that inhibit order, such as branching, and diminished by features 
that encourage order, such as cross-linking
