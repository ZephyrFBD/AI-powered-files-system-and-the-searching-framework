y produce PGA, which is converted to glucose by carbon
fixation in the light-independent reactions.
Water is split apart, providing hydrogen ions and electrons to
NADP for temporary storage.
They occur in the stroma of chloroplasts.
A group of scientists wished to learn about the energy efficiency of
different modes of locomotion. They studied the literature that was
based on accurate measurements and produced the following graph
based on the data they analyzed:
Which of the following statements accurately describes what the
scientists discovered?
An animal with a large body mass expends more energy per
kilogram of body mass than a small animal does, regardless of
the type of locomotion.
Swimming involves overcoming drag as well as gravity.
Running is the least energy efficient mode of locomotion.
The best parameter to measure in this type of experiment is
CO2 consumption.
Which aspect of cell structure best reveals the unity of all life?
All cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane.
