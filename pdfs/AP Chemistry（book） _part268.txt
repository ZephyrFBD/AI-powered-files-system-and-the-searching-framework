ctly through the foil without deflection, with a few particles 
deflected about 1°, consistent with Thomson’s plum-pudding model. For the sake of com-
pleteness, Rutherford suggested that Ernest Marsden (1889–1970), an undergraduate student 
working in the laboratory, look for scattering at large angles. To everyone’s surprise, a small 
amount of scattering was observed at large angles, with some particles scattered back in the 
direction from which they had come. The explanation for these results was not immediately 
obvious, but they were clearly inconsistent with Thomson’s plum-pudding model.
Rutherford explained the results by postulating the nuclear model of the atom, 
in which most of the mass of each gold atom and all of its positive charge reside in a 
very small, extremely dense region that he called the nucleus. He postulated further 
that most of the volume of an atom is empty space in which electrons move around the 
nucleus. In the a@scattering experiment, most of the part
