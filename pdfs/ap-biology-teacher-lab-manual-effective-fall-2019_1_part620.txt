■ Designing and Conducting Your Investigation 
Now that you’ve learned about the techniques used to create DNA profiles or 
“fingerprints,” it’s time to apply the techniques as you investigate the disappearance of 
Ms. Mason. Your task is to design and conduct a procedure based on DNA evidence to 
determine whose blood is spattered on the classroom floor. The chief investigator (your 
teacher) will provide you with DNA evidence collected at the crime scene from the 
blood, Ms. Mason (saliva on her coffee cup), Mr. Gladson (tissue with which he wiped 
his nose), and Bobby (bubble gum). In addition, you will be given a sample of DNA cut 
with HindIII. Remember from your analysis of the “ideal” or mock gel that DNA cut 
with HindIII serves as a marker, providing a set of RFLPs of known sizes (standard).

floor. Because this c
