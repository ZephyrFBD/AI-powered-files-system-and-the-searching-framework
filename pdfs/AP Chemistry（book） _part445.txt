the 
answer we derived in this exercise: 5>200 = 2.5 * 10-2 mol; 
(2.5 * 10-2)(6 * 1023) = 15 * 1021 = 1.5 * 1022 molecules.  
The units (molecules) and the number of significant figures 
(three) are appropriate.
(b) The answer is six times as large as the answer to part (a),  
exactly what it should be. The number of significant  
figures (three) and the units (atoms O) are correct.
3.5 ∣ Empirical Formulas from Analyses
The empirical formula for a substance tells us the relative number of atoms of each el-
ement in the substance. 
(Section 2.6) The empirical formula H2O shows that water 
contains two H atoms for each O atom. This ratio also applies on the molar level: 1 mol 
of H2O contains 2 mol of H atoms and 1 mol of O atoms. Conversely, the ratio of the num-
bers of moles of all elements in a compound gives the subscripts in the compound’s empirical 
 
formula. Thus, the mole concept provides a way of calculating empirical formulas.
Mercury and chlorine, for example, combine to f
