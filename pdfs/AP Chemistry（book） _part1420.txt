verlap region, forming a type of covalent bond 
called a sigma 1S2 bond. Examples of sigma bond formation include:
t the overlap of two s orbitals; one from each H in H2 (Figure 9.12),
t the overlap of an H s orbital and a Cl p orbital in HCl (Figure 9.12),
t the overlap of two p orbitals; one from each Cl in Cl2 (Figure 9.12),
t the overlap of an F p orbital and a Be sp hybrid orbital in BeF2 (Figure 9.15).
To describe multiple bonding, we must consider a second kind of bond, this one 
the result of overlap between two p orbitals oriented perpendicularly to the internu-
clear axis (Figure 9.20). The sideways overlap of p orbitals produces what is called a pi 
1p2 bond. A p bond is one in which the overlap regions lie above and below the inter-
nuclear axis. Unlike a s bond, in a p bond the electron density is not concentrated on 
the internuclear axis. Although it is not evident in Figure 9.20, the sideways orienta-
tion of p orbitals in a p bond makes for weaker overlap. As a res
