force. You may want to consult Chapters 2, 4, and 7, and 
be sure to draw a careful free-body diagram of the person.]
(c) Estimate the decelerating force if the person lands 
stiff-legged so
(d) Estimate the stress in the
tibia (a lower leg bone of
),
and
determine whether or not 
the bone will break if the
landing is made with bent
legs
(e) Estimate
the stress and determine if the
tibia will break in a stiff-
legged landing (d = 1.0 cm).

4. In Example 9–6, the torque is calculated around the axis
where the cable is attached to the beam. (a) By using the
equation with this axis of rotation, how do you know
that the vertical force on the hinge points up and not down?
(b) What advantage would be gained in solving part (a) if
the axis of rotation were chosen around the hinge instead 
of around the point where the cable is attached? (c) Show
that you get the
