an example of uniparental inheritance in which all progeny have the genotype and phenotype of the female
parent.
Maternal inheritance can be demonstrated in the haploid fungus Neurospora by crossing the fungi in such a
way that one parent contributes the bulk of the cytoplasm to the progeny. This cytoplasm-contributing parent is
called the female parent, even though no true sexual reproduction occurs. The inheritance patterns of a mutant
strain of Neurospora called poky have been studied using such crosses. Poky differs from the wild-type in that
it is slow-growing and has abnormal quantities of cytochromes.
Investigators suspected that the poky mutation was carried in the mitochondria, instead of in the nuclear
genome. The following experiments were designed to test this hypothesis.
Step 1: Mitochondria were extracted from poky Neurospora mutants.
Step 2: An ultrafine needle and syringe was used to inject these mitochondria into wild-type Neurospora cells.
Step 3: These recipient cel
