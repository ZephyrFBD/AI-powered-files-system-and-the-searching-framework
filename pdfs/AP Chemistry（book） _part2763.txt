reases 
the solubility. However, the effect of F- on the solubility is more 
pronounced than that of Ca2 +  because 3F-4 appears to the second 
power in the Ksp expression for CaF2, whereas 3Ca2 +4 appears to 
the first power.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Consider a saturated solution of the salt MA3, in which M is 
a metal cation with a 3+ charge and A is an anion with a 1- 
charge, in water at 298 K. Which of the following will affect 
the Ksp of MA3 in water?
(a) The addition of more M3 +  to the solution. (b) The addition 
of more A- to the solution. (c) Diluting the solution. (d) Raising 
the temperature of the solution. (e) More than one of the above 
factors.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
For manganese(II) hydroxide, Mn1OH22, Ksp = 1.6 * 10-13. 
Calculate the molar solubility of Mn1OH22 in a solution that 
contains 0.020 M NaOH.
