n. When you use it, you search a number of 
databases for specific gene information. Entrez Gene is separate from BLAST in that it searches for 
a specific gene’s sequence. BLAST then compares the sequence of the single, specific gene with other 
sequences in the database. An example procedure of how Entrez Gene and BLAST work together is 
described in the following example.

■ Examining Gene Sequences Without BLAST 
One of the benefits of learning to use BLAST is that students get to experience a 
scientific investigation in the same manner as the scientists who use this tool. However, 
it is not necessary to BLAST common genes of interest. Many researchers have saved 
common BLAST searches into a database. The following video demonstrates how to 
access these saved BLAST queries:
