new traits or phenotypes, like inserting genes into a corn genome that help the
crops ward off pests. This process is very complicated in higher plants and animals, but relatively simple in bacteria.
You are responsible for knowing the ways in which bacteria can accept fragments of foreign DNA:
Conjugation: the transfer of genetic material between bacteria via a pilus, a bridge between the two cells
Transformation: a process in which bacteria take up foreign genetic material from the environment
Transduction: a process in which a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria) transfers genetic material from
one bacteria to another
In addition, DNA can also be inserted into bacteria by using plasmids, which are small, circular DNA fragments that
can serve as a vector to incorporate genes into the hostâ€™s chromosome. Plasmids are key elements in genetic
engineering. The concepts you need to know about plasmids include the following:
One way to incorporate specific genes into a plasmid is t
