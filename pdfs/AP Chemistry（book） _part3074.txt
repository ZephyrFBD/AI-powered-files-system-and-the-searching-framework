ple, the theoretical 
maximum work obtained for the combustion of gasoline is given by 
the value of ∆G for the combustion reaction. On average, standard 
internal combustion engines are inefficient in utilizing this poten-
tial work—more than 60% of the potential work is lost (primarily as 
heat) in converting the chemical energy of the gasoline to mechan-
ical energy to move the vehicle. When other losses are considered—
idling time, braking, aerodynamic drag, and so forth—only about 
15% of the potential work from the gasoline is used to move the car. 
Advances in automobile design—such as hybrid technology, and 
new lightweight materials—have the potential to increase the per-
centage of useful work obtained from the gasoline.
