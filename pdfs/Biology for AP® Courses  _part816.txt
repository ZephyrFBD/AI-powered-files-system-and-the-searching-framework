curs during which pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl CoA.
Then, the first step of the cycle begins: This is a condensation step, combining the two-carbon acetyl group with a four-
carbon oxaloacetate molecule to form a six-carbon molecule of citrate. CoA is bound to a sulfhydryl group (-SH) and
diffuses away to eventually combine with another acetyl group. This step is irreversible because it is highly exergonic. The
rate of this reaction is controlled by negative feedback and the amount of ATP available. If ATP levels increase, the rate of
this reaction decreases. If ATP is in short supply, the rate increases.
Step 2. In step two, citrate loses one water molecule and gains another as citrate is converted into its isomer, isocitrate.
Step 3. In step three, isocitrate is oxidized, producing a five-carbon molecule, Î±-ketoglutarate, together with a molecule of
CO2 and two electrons, which reduce NAD+ to NADH. This step is also regulated by negative feedback from ATP and
NADH, and a posit
