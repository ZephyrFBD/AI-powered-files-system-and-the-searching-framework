or BrF5. But can we extend 
the use of hybrid orbitals to describe the bonding in these molecules? In short, the 
answer is no; hybrid orbitals should not be used for hypervalent molecules. Letâ€™s ex-
amine the reasons.
The valence-bond model we developed for period 2 elements works well for com-
pounds of period 3 elements so long as we have no more than an octet of electrons in 
the valence-shell orbitals. Thus, for example, it is appropriate to discuss the bonding in 
PF3 or H2Se in terms of hybridized s and p orbitals on the central atom.
For compounds with more than an octet, we could imagine increasing the number 
of hybrid orbitals formed by including valence-shell d orbitals. For example, for SF6 we 
could envision mixing in two sulfur 3d orbitals in addition to the 3s and three 3p orbit-
als to make a total of six hybrid orbitals. However, the sulfur 3d orbitals are substantially 
higher in energy than the 3s and 3p orbitals, so the amount of energy needed to form the 
six hybr
