A frameshift mutation that results in the insertion of three nucleotides is often less deleterious than a mutation that
results in the insertion of one nucleotide. Why?
a.
Addition of three nucleotides does not shift the reading frame.
b.
Addition of three nucleotides shifts the reading frame.
c.
Addition of three nucleotides incorporates two amino acids.
d.
Addition of three nucleotides removes two amino acids.
Mutations in repair genes have been known to cause cancer. Many mutated repair gene
