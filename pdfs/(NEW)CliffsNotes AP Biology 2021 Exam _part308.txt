is random—that is, either chromosome of a homologous pair can migrate to either pole (Mendel’s law of
segregation).
Different homologous pairs of chromosomes act independently of other homologous chromosome pairs. Thus, genes
that are on different chromosomes (unlinked) migrate independently of genes on other chromosomes (Mendel’s law
of independent assortment).
b. When two genes are linked, they are on the same chromosome. If they are on the same chromosome, they migrate
together to either pole (unless crossing over occurs). Thus, they violate Mendel’s law of independent assortment and
are inherited together as if they were a single gene in a monohybrid cross. If the dominant alleles A and B are on one
chromosome and the recessive alleles a and b are on the homologous chromosome, they produce only two kinds of
gametes, AB and ab. Then, the dihybrid cross AaBb × AaBb would produce a 1:2:1 genotypic ratio for AABB, AaBb,
and aabb with a phenotypic ratio of 3:1, not the typical 9:3:3:1 p
