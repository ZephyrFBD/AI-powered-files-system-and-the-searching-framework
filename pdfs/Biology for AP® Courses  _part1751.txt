way, are encoded together
in blocks called operons. For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each
other in the lactose (or lac) operon.
In prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons: repressors,
activators, and inducers. Repressors are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus,
whereas activators are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. Finally, inducers
are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of
substrate.

Bacteria such as E. coli need amino acids to survive. Tryptophan is one such amino acid that E. coli can ingest from the
environment. E. coli can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes. These five genes are
next to each other in what
