 the
potential difference determined by the chemical reactions in
the battery and equals the terminal voltage when no current is
drawn. When a current is drawn, the voltage at the battery’s ter-
minals is less than its emf by an amount equal to the potential
decrease Ir across the internal resistance.
When resistances are connected in series (end to end in a
single linear path), the equivalent resistance is the sum of the
individual resistances:
(19;3)
In a series combination,
is greater than any component
resistance.
When resistors are connected in parallel, it is the reciprocals
that add up:
(19;4)
In a parallel connection, the net resistance is less than any of
the individual resistances.
Kirchhoff’s rules are useful in determining the currents and
voltages in circuits. Kirchhoff’s junction rule is based on conser-
vation of electric charge and states that the sum of all currents
entering any junction equals the sum of all currents leaving that
junction. The second, or loop rule, is
