ribe TWO events that are common to both mitosis and meiosis that ensure the resulting 
daughter cells inherit the appropriate number of chromosomes. 
Description (1 point each; 2 points maximum) 
• 
Spindle elements (microtubules) form/attach to chromosomes 
• 
Chromatin condenses 
• 
Alignment of chromosomes across center of cell prior to chromosome separation 
• 
Separation of chromatids/centromeres to daughter cells 
• 
G2/M checkpoint occurs in both processes 
• 
Replication or synthesis of DNA precedes mitosis/meiosis 
• 
Cytokinesis separates daughter cells after mitosis/meiosis 
 
(b) The genetic composition of daughter cells produced by mitosis differs from that of the daughter 
cells produced by meiosis. Describe TWO features of the cell division processes that lead to these 
differences.
