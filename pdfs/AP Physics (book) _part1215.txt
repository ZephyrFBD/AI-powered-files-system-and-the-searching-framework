ROACH To determine the tension, we need to find the wave speed using
Eq. 11–12
and then use Eq. 11–13, solving it for 
SOLUTION (a) The wavelength of the fundamental is 
(Eq. 11–19a with
). The speed of the wave on the string is
Then we have (Eq. 11–13)
(b) The first harmonic (the fundamental) has a frequency 
The
frequencies of the second, third, and fourth harmonics are two, three, and four
times the fundamental frequency: 262, 393, and 524 Hz, respectively.
NOTE The speed of the wave on the string is not the same as the speed of the
sound wave that the piano string produces in the air (as we shall see in Chapter 12).

A standing wave does appear to be standing in place (and a traveling wave
appears to move). The term “standing” wave is also meaningful from the point of
view of energy. Since the string is at rest at th
