uires a cell surface receptor. The exact class
can be determined on the basis of the hormoneâ€™s
size.

b.
Hormones only affect cells that have
corresponding hormone receptors.

intracellular receptors.
d.

a.
Hormone receptors can induce cell-signaling
pathways and mediate changes in target cells in
the presence of hormones.
b.
Hormone receptors can mediate changes in
target cells and act as transcription regulators in
the presence of hormones.

Hormone receptors can induce cell-signaling
pathways and act as transcription regulators in
the presence of hormones.
