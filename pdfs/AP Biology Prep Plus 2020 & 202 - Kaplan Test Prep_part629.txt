CHROMOSOME ALTERATIONS
Several types of chromosomal breakage can occur in the course of DNA
replication or at other points in the cell cycle. Some of these alterations
can cause drastic changes in the ability of a cell to produce certain
proteins. Many birth defects can be traced to defects in chromosome
structure passed down through sperm or egg cells, in which one of the
following alterations has taken place:
Deletion is when a chromosomal fragment, either from the end of a
chromosome or from somewhere in the middle, is lost as the
chromosome replicates.
If the fragment that detaches from a chromosome during a deletion
event reattaches itself to the homologous chromosome, that
chromosome will then have two sets of identical genes in a particular
region (a duplication), while the original chromosome where the deletion
occurred will be shorter than normal.
There is also the possibility that the deleted fragment could attach back
into the chromosome from which it came, but
