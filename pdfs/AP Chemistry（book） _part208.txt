lthough  
it would be tiring to carry it around all day. Milk is mostly  
water and will have a density not too different from that  
of water. Therefore, we might estimate that a gallon of  
water has mass that is more than 5 lb but less than 50 lb.  
The mass we have calculated, 3.78 kg * 2.2 lb>kg = 8.3 lb, is 
thus reasonable.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Composite decking is a manufactured substitute for wood 
compounded from post-consumer plastic and wood. It is 
frequently used in outdoor decks. The density of a partic-
ular composite decking is reported as 60.0 lb>ft3. What is 
the density in kg/L?  
(a) 138 kg/L (b) 0.961 kg/L (c) 259 kg/L (d) 15.8 kg/L  
(e) 11.5 kg/L
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
The density of the organic compound benzene is 0.879 g/mL. 
Calculate the mass in grams of 1.00 qt of benzene.
