eneficial for people with gout and why it can cause
undesirable side effects, such as low white blood cell counts.
a.
Colchicine increases inflammation by inhibiting mitosis. Inhibition of mitosis results in decreased white
blood count.
b.
Colchicine decreases inflammation by inhibiting mitosis. Inhibition of mitosis results in decreased white
blood count.
c.
Colchicine increases inflammation by inhibiting mitosis. Inhibition of mitosis results in increased white
blood count.
d.
Colchicine decreases inflammation by inhibiting mitosis. Inhibition of mitosis results in increased white
blood count.
Karyokinesis (Mitosis)
Karyokinesis, also known as mitosis, is divided into a series of phases—prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and
