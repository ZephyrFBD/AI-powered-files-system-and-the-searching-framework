Overview
Scientists make hypotheses and then design experiments to test these hypotheses. Data are gathered during these
experiments and then analyzed. Scientists use these analyses to draw conclusions about the data. An important tool
in data analysis is statistics. Statistical tests are used to evaluate hypotheses. Descriptive statistics describe data sets.
This chapter will review some of the statistical tests and descriptive statistics you need to understand for the AP
Biology course and exam.
What Is a Null Hypothesis?
The null hypothesis (H0) states that there is no statistically significant difference between two groups in an
experiment. For example, a student designs an experiment to see if plants watered with bottled water will exhibit
more growth than plants watered with tap water. The null hypothesis for this experiment would be that there will be
no statistically significant difference in plant growth
