s cycle and that the net effect is the same as
for the proton–proton chain. (b) What is the total energy
release? (c) Determine the energy output for each reaction
and decay. (d) Why might the carbon cycle require a higher
temperature 
than the proton–proton chain
5. Consider the effort by humans to harness nuclear fusion as
a viable energy source. (a) What are some advantages of
using nuclear fusion rather than nuclear fission? (b) What
is the major technological problem with using controlled
nuclear fusion as a source of energy? (c) Discuss two
different approaches to solving this problem. (d) What
fuel is necessary in a nuclear fusion reaction? (e) Write a
nuclear reaction using two nuclei of the fuel in part (d) to
create a third nucleus. (f) Calculate the Q-value of the
reaction in part (e).
6. (a) Explain how each of the following can cause damage to
materials: beta particles, alpha particles, energetic neutrons,
and gamma rays. (b) How might metals be damaged?
(c) How can the da
