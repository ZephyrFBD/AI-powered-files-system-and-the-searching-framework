 as better running speed
c.
Natural selection produces adaptations, such as
better running speed, to help individuals survive
and reproduce
d.
Natural selection reproduces individuals with
favorable genetic traits-such as the adaptation of
better running speed-over time.
27. Give an example of convergent evolution and explain
how it supports the theory of evolution by natural
selection.
a.
An example of convergent evolution is the
development of the same function, swimming, in
organisms that live in different parts of the
globe, such as Arctic beluga whales and
Antarctic right whales. The fact that organisms
that do not come in contact with each other have
developed the same traits suggests that natural
selection can produce similar adaptations in
organisms who share a similar environment
b.
An example of convergent evolution is the set of
adaptations, such as better running speed or
more efficient hunting, developed by a species in
response to competition with a new species that
moves
