 Black Deathâ€”bubonic
plague in Europe during the 14th century.
How were researchers able to use modern science to determine the agent of disease for the bubonic plague of the 14th
century?
a.
The amino acid sequence of proteins, extracted from the samples taken from skeletons buried in a cemetery
from the 14th century, was constructed and compared to that of modern strain of the bacterium Y.
enterocolitica and found a close match.
b.
The genomic sequence of the DNA, extracted from the samples taken from skeletons buried in a cemetery
from the 14th century, was constructed and compared to that of modern strain of the bacterium Y.
enterocolitica and found a close match.
c.
The gene sequence of 16S rRNA, extracted from the samples taken from skeletons buried in a cemetery from
the 14th century, was constructed and compared to that of modern strain of the bacterium Y. pestis and found
a close match.
d.
The genomic sequence of the DNA, extracted from the samples taken from skeletons buried
