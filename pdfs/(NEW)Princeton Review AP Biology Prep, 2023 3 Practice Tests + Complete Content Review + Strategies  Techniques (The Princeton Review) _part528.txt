hrough the membrane and bind to an intracellular
receptor. A noncompetitive inhibitor would bind to an estrogen receptor, reducing the effectiveness of this
binding. Choice (A) is incorrect because estrogen binds to intracellular receptors, not receptors at the plasma

but (B) is the best answer because the pancreas is a gland that secretes copious amounts of protein and
hormones, such as insulin.
