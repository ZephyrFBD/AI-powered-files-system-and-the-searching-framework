diffusion rate 
 
1 point 
correct explanation for 10% line — must include a discussion of rate; connects concentration 
of NaCl with diffusion rate 
 
or 
 
 
1 point 
general explanation that solute concentration affects the rate of diffusion; answers that 
attempt to explain the 0%, 1% or 10 % NaCl lines are not eligible to receive this point 
 
4. (c) 
4 points maximum 
 
 
1 point 
statement that water will leave the plant and description of effect this has on plant cell (e.g., 
loss of turgor, plasmolysis, decrease in cell volume, decrease in central vacuole volume) 
 
1 point 
concept of osmosis (e.g., movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane (cell 
or cell membrane) from solution with lower solute concentration (hypotonic) to solution with 
higher solute concentration (hypertonic) 
 
1 point 
explanation that water moves from solution with higher (more positive/less negative) water 
potential (ψ) to solution with lower (more negative) water potential (ψ)
