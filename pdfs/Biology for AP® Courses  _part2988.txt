roughage. Pseudo-ruminants have similar digestive processes as ruminants but do not have the four-compartment stomach.
Processing food involves ingestion (eating), digestion (mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of large molecules),
absorption (cellular uptake of nutrients), and elimination (removal of undigested waste as feces).
Many organs work together to digest food and absorb nutrients. The mouth is the point of ingestion and the location where
both mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins. Saliva contains an enzyme called amylase that breaks down
carbohydrates. The food bolus travels through the esophagus by peristaltic movements to the stomach. The stomach has an
extremely acidic environment. An enzyme called pepsin digests protein in the stomach. Further digestion and absorption
take place in the small intestine. The large intestine reabsorbs water from the undi
