on with our
physical and living environment. Lyme disease, for instance, serves as one modern-day example of the connection between
our health and the natural world (Figure 35.1). More formally known as Lyme borreliosis, Lyme disease is a bacterial
infection that can be transmitted to humans when they are bitten by the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis), which is the primary
vector for this disease. However, not all deer ticks carry the bacteria that will cause Lyme disease in humans, and I.
scapularis can have other hosts besides deer. In fact, it turns out that the probability of infection depends on the type of host
upon which the tick develops: a higher proportion of ticks that live on white-footed mice carry the bacterium than do ticks
that live on deer. Knowledge about the environments and population densities in which the host species is abundant would
help a physician or an epidemiologist better understand how Lyme disease is transmitted and how its incidence could be
reduced.
