60. (II) A crate is given an initial speed of 
up the 25.0°
plane shown in Fig. 4–60. (a) How far up the plane will it
go? (b) How much time elapses before it returns to its
starting point? Assume
61. (II) A car can decelerate at 
without skidding
when coming to rest on a level road. What would its decel-
eration be if the road is inclined at 9.3° and the car moves
uphill? Assume the same static friction coefficient.
62. (II) A skier moves down a 12° slope at constant speed. What
can you say about the coefficient of friction,
Assume the
speed is low enough that air resistance can be ignored.
63. (II) The coefficient of kinetic friction for a 22-kg bobsled
on a track is 0.10. What force is required to push it down 
along a 6.0° incline and achieve a speed of 
at the
end of 75 m?
