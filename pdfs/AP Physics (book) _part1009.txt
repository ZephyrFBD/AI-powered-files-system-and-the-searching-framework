 makes an angle of 27° below
the horizontal. Initially, without the bear pulling, the angle
was 15°; the tension in the cord with the bear pulling is
double what it was when he was not. Calculate the force
the bear is exerting on the backpack.

71. Two identical, uniform beams are symmetrically set up
against each other (Fig. 9–87) on a floor
with which they have a coefficient of fric-
tion
What is the minimum
angle the beams can make with the
floor and still not fall?
ms = 0.50.

and length 
stands
upright on a firm surface. A 65-kg man climbs atop the rod.
(a) Determine the percent decrease in the rod’s length.
(b) When a metal is compressed, each atom moves closer to
its neighboring atom by exactly the same fractional amount.
If iron atoms in steel are normally
apart, by
what distance did this
