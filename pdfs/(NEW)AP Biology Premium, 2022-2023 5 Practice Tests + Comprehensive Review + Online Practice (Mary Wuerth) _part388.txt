Repressible Operons
Repressible operons usually have an anabolic function (synthesizing molecules) and are turned on unless the
product of the operon is in abundance in the cell. The trp operon is an example of a repressible operon. (See Figure
17.3.) The function of the trp operon is to produce the enzymes needed to synthesize the amino acid tryptophan. In
the trp operon, the amino acid tryptophan functions as a corepressor. The trp repressor protein cannot bind to the
operator sequence on its own; the trp repressor must be bound to the amino acid tryptophan before it can bind to the
operator. Therefore, if no tryptophan is present, the trp repressor will not be bound to the operator and RNA
polymerase can transcribe the operon. When tryptophan is present, it will bind to the trp repressor, which will then
bind to the operator, stopping transcription of the operon. This type of feedback mechanism allows the cell to make
the en
