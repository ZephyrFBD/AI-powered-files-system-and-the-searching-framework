rs to the right of the decimal point are the significant figures in a logarithm. Because our 
original value for the concentration 11.0 * 10-7 M2 has two significant figures, the corre-
sponding pH has two decimal places 17.002.
What happens to the pH of a solution as we make the solution more acidic, so that 
3H+4 increases? Because of the negative sign in the logarithm term of Equation 16.17, 
*Because 3H+4 and 3H3O+4 are used interchangeably, you might see pH defined as -log 3H3O+4.

the pH decreases as 3H+4 increases. For example, when we add sufficient acid to make 
3H+4 = 1.0 * 10-3 M, the pH is
 
pH = -log11.0 * 10-32 = -1-3.002 = 3.00 
At 25 °C the pH of an acidic solution is less than 7.00.
We can also calculate the pH of a basic solution, one in which 3OH-4 7
1.0 * 10-7 M. Suppose 3OH -4 = 2.0 * 10-3 M. We can use Equation 16.16 to calculate 
3H+4 for this solution and Equation 16.17 to calculate the pH:
 
3H+4 =

3OH-4 = 1.0 * 10-14
