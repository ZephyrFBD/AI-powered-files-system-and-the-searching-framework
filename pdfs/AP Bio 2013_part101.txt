Justification of Prediction 
(1 point maximum) 
Protein may have a different 
structure and a change in function. 
Change in amino acid sequence of the protein starting at 
position 5 could alter the overall structure or local structural 
regions, interfering with function of the protein. 
Protein may have a different 
structure and no change in 
function. 
Change in amino acid sequence alters the shape / 
conformation / folding / binding region / regulatory region 
of the protein, but does not affect the critical functional 
region(s) of the protein. 
Protein structure and function may 
not be affected. 
Change in amino acid sequence does not alter the protein 
shape / conformation / folding and does not alter function.
