mixture A combination of two or more substances in which 
each substance retains its own chemical identity. (Section 1.2)
molal boiling-point-elevation constant (Kb) A constant 
characteristic of a particular solvent that gives the increase 
in boiling point as a function of solution molality: ∆T
b = iKbm. 
(Section 13.5)
molal freezing-point-depression constant (Kf) A constant 
characteristic of a particular solvent that gives the decrease in 
freezing point as a function of solution molality: ∆T
f = -iKf m. 
(Section 13.5)
molality The concentration of a solution expressed as moles of 
solute per kilogram of solvent; abbreviated m. (Section 13.4)
molar heat capacity The heat required to raise the temperature 
of one mole of a substance by 1 °C. (Section 5.5)
molarity The concentration of a solution expressed as moles of 
solute per liter of solution; abbreviated M. (Section 4.5)
molar mass The mass of one mole of a substance in grams; it is 
numerically equal to the formula weig
