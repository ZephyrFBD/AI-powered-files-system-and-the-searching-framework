 15.13 Suppose that the gas-phase reactions A ¡  B and 
B ¡  A are both elementary processes with rate con-
stants of 4.7 * 10-3 s-1 and 5.8 * 10-1 s-1, respectively. 
(a) What is the value of the equilibrium constant for the 
equilibrium A1g2 ∆ B1g2? (b) Which is greater at equi-
librium, the partial pressure of A or the partial pressure of B?
