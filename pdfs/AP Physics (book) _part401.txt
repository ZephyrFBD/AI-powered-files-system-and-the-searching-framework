mg, acting downward on the box, can now be balanced by an upward
static friction force whose maximum magnitude is proportional to the normal
force. The harder you push, the greater 
is and the greater 
can be. If you
don’t press hard enough, then
and the box begins to slide down.

EXERCISE G If  
and  
what minimum force F will keep the box
from falling: (a) 100 N; (b) 80 N; (c) 50 N; (d) 20 N; (e) 8 N?
mg = 20 N,
ms = 0.40
Pulling against friction. A 10.0-kg box is pulled along a
horizontal surface by a force 
of 40.0 N applied at a 30.0° angle above hori-
zontal. This is like Example 4–11 except now there is friction, and we assume a
coefficient of kinetic friction of 0.30. Calculate the acceleration.
APPROACH The free-body diagram is shown in Fig. 4–30. It is much like that
in Fig. 4–21b, but with one more force, friction.
SOLUTION The calculation for the vertical (y) direction is just the same 
as in Example 4–11b,
and 
With y positive up
