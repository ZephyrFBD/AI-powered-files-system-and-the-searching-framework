nditions, we look at the sign of ∆G°.
Solve
 
∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S°
 = 180.7 kJ - 1298 K2124.7 J>K2a 1 kJ
103 J
b
 = 180.7 kJ - 7.4 kJ
 = 173.3 kJ
Because ∆G° is positive, the reaction is not spontaneous under 
standard conditions at 298 K.
Comment Notice that we converted the units of the T∆S° term to kJ 
so that they could be added to the ∆H ° term, whose units are kJ.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of these statements is true? (a) All spontaneous reac-
tions have a negative enthalpy change (b) All spontaneous 
reactions have a positive entropy change (c) All spontaneous 
reactions have a positive free-energy change (d) All sponta-
neous reactions have a negative free-energy change (e) All 
spontaneous reactions have a negative entropy change
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Calculate ∆G° for a reaction for which ∆H° = 24.6 kJ and 
∆S° = 132 J>K at 298 K. Is the reaction spontaneous under 
these conditions?
