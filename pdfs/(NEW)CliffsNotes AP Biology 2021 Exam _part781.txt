eds. This
microrespirometer is the control.
3. Place both microrespirometers (weighted down with washers) in a water bath to maintain a constant temperature.
4. Place a drop of a weak solution of soap and red food coloring to the open end of the capillary tubes. The soap
reduces the adhesion of water to the glass tube, allowing it to flow freely, and the red food dye makes the water
more visible. If the drop does not flow into the tube on its own, pull lightly on the plunger.
5. At regular time intervals, record changes in volume in the capillary
 
tubes. As O2 is consumed, the red drop should move downward toward
the syringe, indicating a decrease in volume.
6. Changes in volume observed in the control microrespirometer represent responses to changes in temperature and
pressure. Use these values to correct values observed in the treatment microrespirometer.
7. Graph the accumulated change in volume vs. elapsed time. The rate of respiration is the slope of the line of best
fit through
