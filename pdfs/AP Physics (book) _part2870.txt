at is the total
magnification?
35. (II) An astronomical telescope has its two lenses spaced
82.0 cm apart. If the objective lens has a focal length of
78.5 cm, what is the magnification of this telescope?
Assume a relaxed eye.
36. (II) A Galilean telescope adjusted for a relaxed eye is
36.8 cm long. If the objective lens has a focal length of
39.0 cm, what is the magnification?
37. (II) What is the magnifying power of an astronomical tele-
scope using a reflecting mirror whose radius of curvature is
6.1 m and an eyepiece whose focal length is 2.8 cm?
38. (II) The Moonâ€™s image appears to be magnified 
by
a reflecting astronomical telescope with an eyepiece having
a focal length of 3.1 cm. What are the focal length and radius
of curvature of the main (objective) mirror?
39. (II) A 
astronomical telescope is adjusted for a relaxed
eye when the two lenses are 1.10 m apart. What is the focal
length of each lens?
40. (II) An astronomical telescope longer than about 50 cm is
not easy to hold
