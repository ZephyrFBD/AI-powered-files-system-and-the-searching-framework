h the capillary network in the glomerulus, which filters out
almost all solutes, except for uric acid, by glomerular filtration. Second, the filtrate is collected in the renal
tubules. Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule by tubular reabsorption. Third,
additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the tubules of the kidney during tubular secretion.

First, the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the glomerulus, which filters out
almost all solutes, except for proteins, by glomerular filtration. Second, the filtrate is collected in the renal
tubules. Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubule by tubular reabsorption. Third,
additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the tubules of the kidney during tubular secretion.
Tubular Reabsorption and Secretion
Tubular reabsorption occurs in the PCT part of the renal tubule. Almost all nutrients are reabsorbed, and this occurs either
by passive or activ
