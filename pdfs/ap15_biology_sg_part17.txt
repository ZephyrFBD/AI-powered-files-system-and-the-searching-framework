Question 7 
 
Smell perception in mammals involves the interactions of airborne odorant molecules from the 
environment with receptor proteins on the olfactory neurons in the nasal cavity. The binding of odorant 
molecules to the receptor proteins triggers action potentials in the olfactory neurons and results in 
transmission of information to the brain. Mammalian genomes typically have approximately 1,000 
functional odorant-receptor genes, each encoding a unique odorant receptor. 
 
(a) Describe how the signal is transmitted across the synapse from an olfactory sensory neuron to 
the interneuron that transmits the information to the brain.
