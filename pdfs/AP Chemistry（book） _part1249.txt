Because each nitrogen atom has five valence electrons, three electron pairs must be 
shared to achieve the octet configuration.
The properties of N2 are in complete accord with its Lewis structure. Nitrogen 
is a diatomic gas with exceptionally low reactivity that results from the very sta-
ble nitrogen–nitrogen bond. The nitrogen atoms are separated by only 1.10 Å. The 
short separation distance between the two N atoms is a result of the triple bond 
between the atoms. From studies of the structures of many different substances in 
which nitrogen atoms share one or two electron pairs, we have learned that the

Lewis Structure of a Compound
Given the Lewis symbols for nitrogen and fluorine in Figure 8.2, predict the formula of the stable binary compound (a compound 
composed of two elements) formed when nitrogen reacts with fluorine and draw its Lewis structure.
