which opened in 
late 2015 near Carlsbad, California, is capable of producing 50 million gallons of drink-
ing water per day. To operate at full capacity it uses approximately 38 MW of electricity, 
enough to power 38,500 homes. Two gallons of seawater are needed to produce one gal-

Water Purification: Municipal Treatment
The water needed for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use is taken either from lakes,

into municipal water systems is “used” water, meaning it has already passed through one 
or more sewage systems or industrial plants. Consequently, this water must be treated 
before it is distributed to our faucets.
Municipal water treatment usually involves five steps (Figure 18.21).
