Fertilization and Early Development
Sexual reproduction of diploid (2N) organisms involves the
recombination and transmission of genetic material from parents to
oﬀspring via vertical gene transfer and fertilization. (Note: horizontal
gene transfer is the transmission of genetic material from a donor to a
recipient organism that is not its oﬀspring.) For sexual reproduction to
occur, cells undergo gametogenesis—the process that forms egg (ovum)
and sperm (spermatozoon) cells or gametes via meiosis. Recall that
meiosis, which was discussed in chapter 11, is the process that form
