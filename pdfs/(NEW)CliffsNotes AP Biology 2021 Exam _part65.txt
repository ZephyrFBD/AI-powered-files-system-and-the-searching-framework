ating a reaction is by regulating its enzyme. Here are five common ways in which this is done:
1. Enzymes have two kinds of binding sites—one an active site for the substrate and one or more possible allosteric
sites for an allosteric effector. There are two kinds of allosteric effectors:
An allosteric activator binds to the enzyme and induces the enzyme’s active form.
An allosteric inhibitor binds to the enzyme and induces the enzyme’s inactive form.
Some inhibitors bind irreversibly, permanently changing the structure of the enzyme by modifying an amino acid.
Other inhibitors are weakly bonded to the enzyme by ionic or hydrogen bonds, and their effects are reversible.
2. In feedback inhibition, an end product of a series of reactions acts as an allosteric inhibitor, shutting down one of
the enzymes catalyzing the reaction series.
3. In competitive inhibition, a substance that mimics the substrate inhibits an enzyme by occupying the active site.
The mimic displaces the substrate and p
