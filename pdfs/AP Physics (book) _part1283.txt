Intensity Related to Amplitude
The intensity I of a wave is proportional to the square of the wave amplitude, A,
as we saw in Section 11–9. We can therefore relate the amplitude quantitatively
to the intensity I or sound level 
as the following Example shows.

Incredible sensitivity of the ear
How tiny the displacement is. Calculate the displacement
of air molecules for a sound of frequency 1000 Hz at the threshold of hearing.
APPROACH In Section 11–9 we found a relation between intensity I and
displacement amplitude A of a wave, Eq. 11–18. The amplitude of oscillation 
of air molecules is what we want to solve for, given the intensity. Assume the
temperature is 20°C so the speed of sound is 
SOLUTION At the threshold of hearing,
(Table 12–2).
We solve for the amplitude A in Eq. 11–18:
where we have taken the density
