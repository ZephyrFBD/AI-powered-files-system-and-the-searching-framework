BASED, STUDENT-DIRECTED INVESTIGATION? 
Before students investigate cellular respiration, they should be able to demonstrate  
understanding of the following concepts:  
•  The relationship between cell structure and function (mitochondria) 
•  Enzymatic activity and the effects of environmental variables, such as temperature 
and pH, on enzyme-catalyzed reactions 
•  Strategies for capture, storage, and use of free energy 
•  Interdependence of photosynthesis and cellular respiration 
•  Aerobic respiration versus fermentation 
•  Diffusion of gases across cell membranes 
These concepts may be scaffolded according to level of skills and conceptual 
understanding. For example, a number of physical laws relating to gases are important 
to understanding how the respirometer systems used in the investigation(s) measure

respiration rate. In particular, the laws are summarized in the general gas law, and
