cepts an H+ ion from a water mole-
cule and thereby produces an OH- ion (Figure 4.7):

Ammonia is a weak electrolyte because only about 1% of the NH3 forms NH4
+ and 
OH- ions.

◀ Figure 4.7 Proton transfer. An H2O 
molecule acts as a proton donor (acid), 
and NH3 acts as a proton acceptor (base). 
In aqueous solutions, only a fraction 
of the NH3 molecules react with H2O. 
Consequently, NH3 is a weak electrolyte.

CHAPTER 4 Reactions in Aqueous Solution
Identifying Strong and Weak electrolytes
If we remember the common strong acids and bases (Table 4.2) and also remember that 
NH3 is a weak base, we can make reasonable predictions about the electrolytic strength of 
Strong and Weak Acids and Bases
Acids and bases that are strong electrolytes (completely ionized in solution) are strong 
acids and strong bases. Those that are weak electrolytes (partly ionized) are weak 
 
acids and weak bases. When reactivity depen
