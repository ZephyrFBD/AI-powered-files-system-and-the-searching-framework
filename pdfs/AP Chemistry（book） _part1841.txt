Amorphous solids (from the Greek words for “without form”) lack the order found 
in crystalline solids. At the atomic level the structures of amorphous solids are similar to 
the structures of liquids, but the molecules, atoms, and/or ions lack the freedom of motion 
they have in liquids. Amorphous solids do not have the well-defined faces and shapes of a 
crystal. Familiar amorphous solids are rubber, glass, and obsidian (volcanic glass).
Unit Cells and Crystal Lattices
In a crystalline solid, there is a relatively small repeating unit, called a unit cell, that is 
made up of a unique arrangement of atoms and embodies the structure of the solid. The 
structure of the crystal can be built by stacking this unit over and over in all three dimen-
sions. Thus, the structure of a crystalline solid is defined by (a) the size and shape of the 
unit cell and (b) the locations of atoms within the unit cell.
