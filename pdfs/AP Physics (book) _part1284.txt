12–3 The Ear and Its Response;
Loudness
The human ear is a remarkably sensitive detector of sound. Mechanical detectors
of sound (microphones) can barely match the ear in detecting low-intensity
sounds.
The function of the ear is to transform the vibrational energy of waves into
electrical signals which are carried to the brain by way of nerves. A microphone
performs a similar task. Sound waves striking the diaphragm of a microphone
