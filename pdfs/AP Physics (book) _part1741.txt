The direction of the force on the electron is toward the proton, because the
charges have opposite signs so the force is attractive.

EXAMPLE 16;1
Which charge exerts the greater force?
Two positive point charges,
and  
are separated by a
distance 
Fig. 16–17. Which is larger in magnitude, the force that 
exerts 
on 
or the force that 
exerts on 
RESPONSE From Coulomb’s law, the force on 
exerted by 
is
The force on 
exerted by 
is
which is the same magnitude. The equation is symmetric with respect to the two
charges, so  
NOTE Newton’s third law also tells us these two forces must have equal magnitude.
