f the banana slug population in this area likely decreased.
(d) Since the population of banana slugs was randomly separated into two smaller groups that could not

13. (a) The mudslide changed the environment of the area so that darker-colored kangaroo rats had a survival
advantage after the mudslide and the lighter-colored kangaroo rats had a survival disadvantage after the
mudslide.
(b) An appropriate control group would be a similar habitat with a similar species in which a mudslide did not
occur.
(c) Five years after the mudslide, there were more brown-colored kangaroo rats in this area and no kangaroo
rats with white fur. After the mudslide, brown-colored kangaroo rats had a survival advantage over the
white-colored kangaroo rats. (The brown-colored kangaroo rats had fur color that was similar to the color of
the surrounding habitat, so it was more difficult for predators to see the brown-colore
