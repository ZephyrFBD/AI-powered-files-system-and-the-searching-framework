e help of energy
released from the oxidation of ATP and the NADPH. In short, light
reactions produce energy and dark reactions make sugars.
Photosynthesis will be explored further in the first lab section of this
chapter. Comparisons of C3, C4, and CAM plants may show up within the
data provided for a question. Most plants are C3. This means that the
initial products of C fixation are two three-carbon molecules
(phosphoglycerate, or PGA), synthesized through the intermediate
enzyme rubisco. In C4 plants, CO2 is initially fixed into a four-carbon
molecule (oxaloacetate, also found in the Krebs cycle) by the
intermediate enzyme phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) in a mesophyll cell.
This four-carbon molecule later releases a CO2 molecule when it enters a
bundle sheath cell. The enzyme PEP is much more likely to bind to CO2
because it has a higher aﬀinity for CO2 than rubisco. C4 plants have a
physiological advantage in hot, arid environments where they oȇen have
to limit the opening of stomat
