The catalytic properties of the ribosome reflect the
self-catalytic polymerization of nucleotides with
sequential structures conserved in modern DNA, the
catalytic properties conserved in proteins, and the
catalytic properties of the ribosome whose core
structure is RNA. This alternative is the basis for
what is referred to as the RNA-first hypothesis.
74. The radiant energy emitted by a star gradually
increases after its birth. During the Hadean eon, while the
molten Earth cooled and life emerged, the Sun provided
approximately 25% less radiant energy than it does now.
Ignoring effects due to differences in the composition of
Earth's atmosphere between then and now, this means that
the average surface temperature of the surface would be
about 25 °C below the freezing temperature of water.
Evidence of liquid water on Earth during the Hadean eon
is provided by geologic structures known only to form in
liquid water, such as lava pillows and the stromatolites that
are the fossilized lay
