Fluid flow through a pipe of varying
diameter.
Blood flow. In humans, blood flows from
the heart into the aorta, from which it passes into the major arteries, Fig. 10–20.
These branch into the small arteries (arterioles), which in turn branch into myriads
of tiny capillaries. The blood returns to the heart via the veins. The radius of the
aorta is about 1.2 cm, and the blood passing through it has a speed of about
A typical capillary has a radius of about 
and blood flows
through it at a speed of about 
Estimate the number of capillaries
that are in the body.
APPROACH We assume the density of blood doesn’t vary significantly from the
aorta to the capillaries. By the equation of continuity, the volume flow rate in
the aorta must equal the volume flow rate through all the capillaries. The total
area of all the capillaries
