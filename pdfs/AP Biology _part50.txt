only 20 different amino acids, cells can build thousands of different
proteins; see Figure 2.11.
See Figure 2.12, which shows two amino acids combining by
dehydration synthesis to form a dipeptide, a molecule consisting of two
amino acids connected by one peptide bond. In the process, one molecule
of water is released.
Each protein has a unique shape or conformation that determines what
job it performs and how it functions. There are four levels of protein
structure that are responsible for a proteinâ€™s unique conformation. They are
primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures; see Figure
2.13.

The primary structure of a protein refers to the unique linear sequence
of amino acids. The slightest change in the amino acid sequence of a
protein can have major consequences. Such is the case
