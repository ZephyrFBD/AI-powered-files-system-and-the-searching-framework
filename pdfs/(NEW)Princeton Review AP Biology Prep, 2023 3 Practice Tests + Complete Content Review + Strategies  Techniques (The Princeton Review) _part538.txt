segments due to its requirement for 5′ to 3′ polymerization. Since the newly discovered yeast cell has 3′ to 5′
activity, there would be no lagging strand and likely no Okazaki fragments.
2.
C
Since the gene is much shorter than expected, a stop codon must have been introduced by mutagenesis. This is
an example of a nonsense mutation.
3.
D
The order for DNA replication is helicase, RNA primase, DNA polymerase, and ligase.
4.
C
If an mRNA codon is UAC, the complementary segment on a tRNA anticodon is AUG.
5.
D
During post-translational modification, the polypeptide undergoes a conformational change. Choices (A),
intron excision, and (B), a poly(A) addition, are examples of post-transcriptional modifications. Formation of
peptide bonds, (C), occurs during translation, not afterward.
6.
B
If 21 nucleotides compose a sequence and 3 nucleotides compose each codon, there would be 7 codons and
thus a maximum of 7 amino acids.
7.
A
Choice (B) is incorrect because bacteria make membrane protei
