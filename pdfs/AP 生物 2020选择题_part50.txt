55. Which of the following best describes the most
likely effect of the formation of a triplex DNA
structure (Figure 3) on the synthesis of the
frataxin protein?
(A) The binding of the ribosome to the mRNA
is prevented, resulting in a decrease in
frataxin translation. 
(B)
The DNA will not degrade in the
cytoplasm, leading to an increase in
frataxin translation. 
(C)
RNA polymerase is prevented from
binding to the DNA, resulting in a
decrease in frataxin mRNA transcription. 
(D) The protein will include extra amino acids,
resulting in a protein with an altered
secondary structure. 
56. Which of the following types of bonds is most
likely responsible for the unusual base pairing
shown in Figure 3 that results in the formation of
a triplex DNA structure?
(A) Hydrogen
(B)
Polar covalent
(C)
Ionic
(D) Nonpolar covalen
