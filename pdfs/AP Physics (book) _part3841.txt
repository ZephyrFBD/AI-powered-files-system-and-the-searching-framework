ce acting on it. To observers on the ground, this is all very 
clear: the ball has an initial velocity when it is released (because the platform is
moving), and it simply continues moving in a straight-line path as shown in 
Fig. C–1b, in accordance with Newton’s first law.
But what shall we do about the frame of reference of the observers on the
rotating platform? Newton’s first law, the law of inertia, does not hold in this
rotating frame of reference since the ball starts moving with no net force on it.
For this reason, such a frame is called a noninertial reference frame. An inertial
reference frame (as discussed in Chapter 4) is one in which the law of inertia—
Newton’s first law—does hold, and so do Newton’s second and third laws. In a
noninertial reference frame, such as our rotating platform, Newton’s second law
also does not hold. For instance in the situation described above, there is no net
force on the ball; yet, with respect to the rotating platform, the ball accelerates.
