standing biomass over time. Plant species diversity is less than that seen in temperate forests and tropical wet forests. Boreal
forests lack the pronounced elements of the layered forest structure seen in tropical wet forests. The structure of a boreal
forest is often only a tree layer and a ground layer (Figure 35.19). When conifer needles are dropped, they decompose more
slowly than broad leaves; therefore, fewer nutrients are returned to the soil to fuel plant growth.

Arctic Tundra
The Arctic tundra lies north of the subarctic boreal forest and is located throughout the Arctic regions of the northern
hemisphere (Figure 35.12). The average winter temperature is -34 °C (-34 °F) and the average summer temperature is from
3 °C to 12 °C (37 °F–52 °F). Plants in th
