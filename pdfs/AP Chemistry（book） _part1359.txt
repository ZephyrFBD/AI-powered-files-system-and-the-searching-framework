 bound to one H and both O’s. Draw 
the Lewis structure for formic acid, showing resonance if 
present. (b) Formic acid can react with NaOH in aqueous 
solution to produce the formate ion, HCOO-. Write the 
balanced chemical equation for this reaction. (c) Draw the 
Lewis structure of the formate ion, showing resonance if 
present. (d) How many milliliters of a 0.100 M solution of 
NaOH would it take to completely react with 0.785 mL of 
formic acid?
 8.109 Ammonia reacts with boron trifluoride to form a stable 
compound, as we saw in Section 8.7. (a) Draw the Lewis 
structure of the ammonia–boron trifluoride reaction prod-

You have learned that the resonance of benzene, C6H6, gives the 
compound special stability.
(a) By using data in Appendix C, compare the heat of combustion 
of 1.0 mol C6H6(g) to the heat of combustion of 3.0 mol acetylene, 
C2H2(g). Which has the greater fuel v
