 in a short time given by
During this time, the ball moves to the side a distance 
given by
The man at B, in this time , moves a distance
The ball therefore passes behind him a distance s (Fig. C–2a) given by
We saw earlier that
and
so
We substitute
(see above) and get
(C–1)
This same s equals the sideways displacement as seen from the noninertial rotat-
ing system (Fig. C–2b).
Equation C–1 corresponds to motion at constant acceleration, because as we
saw in Chapter 2 (Eq. 2–11b),
for a constant acceleration (with zero ini-
tial velocity in the y direction). Thus, if we write Eq. C–1 in the form
we see that the Coriolis acceleration
is
(C–2)
This relation is valid for any velocity in the plane of rotation perpendicular to the
axis of rotation (in Fig. C–2, the axis through point O perpendicular to the page).
Because the Earth rotates, the Coriolis effect has some interesting manifesta-
tions on the Earth. It affects the movement of air masses and thus has an influence
on weather. In th
