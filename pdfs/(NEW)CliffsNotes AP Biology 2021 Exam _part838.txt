all the variables that might influence the volume

and 2, other than O2 consumption by insects.
 
11. B. Competence refers to a stage of rapid population growth during which bacteria are most receptive to
absorbing foreign DNA.
12. B. The vertical line at 6 cm and the horizontal line at 600 base pairs intersect on the standard curve. On the log
scale for the y-axis, each horizontal line between 100 and 1,000 represents an increase of 100 base pairs.
13. D. This is an example of DNA fingerprinting using gel
electrophoresis. The horizontal bands represent fragments of DNA, produced by a restriction enzyme, that have
migrated across a gel, with lighter fragments moving farthest. Each lane (column) represents the DNA fragments
from a different individual. Fragments in different lanes that have migrated the same distance are fragments
consisting of the same DNA. Since an offspringâ€™s DNA originates from a combination of DNA from both of its
parents, the DNA fragme
