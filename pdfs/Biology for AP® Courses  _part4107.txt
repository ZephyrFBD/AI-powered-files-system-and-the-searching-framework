halamus, which signals for the release of oxytocin
from the posterior pituitary. The oxytocin causes the smooth muscle in the uterine wall to contract. At the same time, the
placenta releases prostaglandins into the uterus, increasing the contractions. A positive feedback relay occurs between the
uterus, hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of oxytocin. As more smooth muscle cells
are recruited, the contractions increase in intensity and force.

There are three stages to labor. During stage one, the cervix thins and dilates. This is necessary for the baby and placenta to
be expelled during birth. The cervix will eventually dilate to about 10 cm. During stage two, the baby is expelled from the
uterus. The uterus contracts and the mother pushes as she compresses her abdominal muscles to aid the delivery. The last
stage is the passage of the placenta after the baby has been born and the organ has comple
