 crest moves) is equal to the
product of wavelength and frequency,

In a transverse wave, the oscillations are perpendicular to
the direction in which the wave travels. An example is a wave
on a cord.
In a longitudinal wave, the oscillations are along (parallel
to) the line of travel; sound is an example.
Waves carry energy from place to place without matter
being carried. The intensity of a wave is the energy per unit time
carried across unit area (in 
). For three-dimensional
waves traveling outward from a point source, the intensity
decreases inversely as the square of the distance from the source
(ignoring damping):

Wave intensity is proportional to the amplitude squared
and to the frequency squared.
Waves reflect off objects in their path. When the wave front
(of a two- or three-dimensional wave) strikes an object, the
angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence. This is 
the law of reflection. When a wave strikes a boundary between
two materials in whic
