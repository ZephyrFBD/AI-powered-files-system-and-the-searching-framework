 is
created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental
disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics. Ideally, these models are accurate enough to determine which
components of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances, and they can serve as a guide to ecosystem managers
(such as conservation ecologists or fisheries biologists) in the practical maintenance of ecosystem health.
Conceptual Models
Conceptual models are useful for describing ecosystem structure and dynamics and for demonstrating the relationships
between different organisms in a community and their environment. Conceptual models are usually depicted graphically as
flow charts. The organisms and their resources are grouped into specific compartments with arrows showing the relationship
and transfer of energy or nutrients between them. Thus, these diagrams are sometimes called compartment models.
To model the cycling of mineral nutrients, o
