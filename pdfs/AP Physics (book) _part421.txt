tion between the crate and the floor is 0.50.
A 20-N force is applied to the crate acting to the right. What
is the resulting static friction force acting on the crate?
(a) 20 N to the right.
(b) 20 N to the left.
(c) 25 N to the right.
(d) 25 N to the left.
(e) None of the above; the crate starts to move.
12. The normal force on an extreme skier descending a very
steep slope (Fig. 4–42) can be zero if 
(a) his speed is great enough.
(b) he leaves the slope (no longer touches the snow).
(c) the slope is greater than 75°.
(d) the slope is vertical (90°).

Question 4.
13. To pull an old stump out of the ground, you and a friend tie
two ropes to the stump. You pull on it with a force of 500 N
to the north while your friend pulls with a force of 450 N to
the northwest. The total force from the two ropes is
(a) less than 950 N.
(b) exactly 950 N.
(c) more than 950 N.
