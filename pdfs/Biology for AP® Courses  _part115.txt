forensic scientists on the job. Also, the development of molecular techniques and the establishment of DNA
databases have expanded the types of work that forensic scientists can do. Their work involves analyzing
samples such as hair, blood, and other body fluids and also processing DNA (Figure 1.20) found in many
different environments and materials. Forensic scientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime
scenes, such as insect larvae or pollen grains. Students who want to pursue careers in forensic science will
most likely be required to take chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math courses.

Another field of biological study, neurobiology, studies the biology of the nervous system, and although it is considered
a branch of biology, it is also recognized as
