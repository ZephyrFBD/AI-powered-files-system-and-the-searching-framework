Conifer Forest—Taiga
Taigas are located in northern Canada and much of the world’s
northern regions.
They are dominated by conifer (evergreen) forests, like spruce and
fir.
The landscape is dotted with lakes, ponds, and bogs.
They have very cold winters.
This is the largest terrestrial biome.
Taigas are characterized by heavy snowfall; the trees are shaped
with branches directed downward to prevent heavy accumulations
of snow from breaking their branches.
Principal large mammals include moose, black bears, lynx, elks,
wolverines, martens, and porcupines.
Flying insects and birds are prevalent in summer.
Taigas have greater variety in species of animals than tundras do.
