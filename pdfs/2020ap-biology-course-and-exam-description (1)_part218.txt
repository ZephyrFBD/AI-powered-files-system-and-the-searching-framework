ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SYI-3.E.1
Several hypotheses about the origin of life on 
Earth are supported with scientific evidence—
a.	Geological evidence provides support for 
models of the origin of life on Earth.
 i.	 Earth formed approximately 4.6 billion 
years ago (bya). The environment was 
too hostile for life until 3.9 bya, and the

 i.	 Primitive Earth provided inorganic 
precursors from which organic 
molecules could have bee
