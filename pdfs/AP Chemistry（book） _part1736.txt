hylammonium cation,

 , the melting point drops to 12 Â°C, making ethylam-
monium nitrate a liquid at room temperature. Ethylammonium 
nitrate is an example of an ionic liquid: a salt that is a liquid at 
room temperature.
Not only is CH3CH2NH3
+ larger than NH4
+
,  but also it is less sym-
metric. In general, the larger and more irregularly shaped the ions 
in an ionic substance, the better the chances of forming an ionic 
liquid. Among the cations that form ionic liquids, one of the most 
widely used is the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cation (abbreviated 
bmim+, Figure 11.17 and Table 11.4), which has two arms of different 
lengths coming off a five-atom central ring. This feature gives bmim+ 
an irregular shape, which makes it difficult for the molecules to pack 
together in a solid.
