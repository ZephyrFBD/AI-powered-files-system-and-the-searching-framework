KEY TERMS
energy necessary for reactions to occur
specific region of the enzyme to which the substrate binds
inhibition by a binding event at a site different from the active site, which induces a conformational
change and reduces the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate
(also, anabolism) pathways that require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones
adenosine triphosphate, the cellâ€™s energy currency
study of energy flowing through living systems
(also, catabolism) pathways in which complex molecules are broken down into simpler ones
potential energy in chemical bonds that is released when those bonds are broken
small organic molecule, such as a vitamin or its derivative, which is required to enhance the a
