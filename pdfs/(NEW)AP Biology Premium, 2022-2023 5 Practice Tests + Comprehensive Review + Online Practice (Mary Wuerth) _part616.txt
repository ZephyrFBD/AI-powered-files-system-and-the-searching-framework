10. A student wants to study the effects of salt (NaCl) concentrations on the activity of the enzyme peroxidase. The
student sets up four tubes, each with the same starting concentration of the substrate (hydrogen peroxide), a pH
of 7, and a temperature of 21째C. What would be an appropriate control in this experiment?
(A) a tube with the same starting concentration of the substrate, a pH of 7, a temperature of 21째C, but a
different salt (KCl)
(B) a tube with the same starting concentration of the substrate, a pH of 7, a temperature of 21째C, but with no
salt (no NaCl)
(C) a tube with the same starting concentration of the substrate, a pH of 7, and a temperature of 37째C
(D) a tube with water that replaces the enzyme solution
