1. (I) The magnetic flux through a coil of wire containing two
loops changes at a constant rate from 
to 
in 0.34 s. What is the emf induced in the coil?
2. (I) The north pole of the magnet in Fig.21–57 is being inserted
into the coil. In which direc-
tion is the induced current
flowing through resistor R?
Explain.
