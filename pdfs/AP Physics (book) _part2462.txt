 total energy stored
per unit volume in a region of space where there is an electromagnetic wave is
(22;5)
In this equation, E and B represent the electric and magnetic field strengths of
the wave at any instant in a small region of space. We can write Eq. 22–5 in 
terms of the E field only using Eqs. 22–2 
and 22–3 
to
obtain
(22;6a)
Note here that the energy density associated with the B field equals that due to
the E field, and each contributes half to the total energy. We can also write the
energy density in terms of the B field only:
(22;6b)
or in one term containing both E and B,
or
(22;6c)
Equations 22–6 give the energy density of EM waves in any region of space at
any instant.
