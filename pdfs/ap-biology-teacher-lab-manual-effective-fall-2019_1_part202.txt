MATHEMATICAL MODELING: 
HARDY-WEINBERG*
How can mathematical models be used to investigate the 
relationship between allele frequencies in populations of 
organisms and evolutionary change?
 
■BACKGROUND
“Mathematics is biology’s next microscope, only better …” (Cohen 2004)
It is not hard to understand the value of microscope technology to biology and how 
this technology opened up entire new worlds of biological understanding. However, for 
some, it is not as easy to see the value of mathematics to the study of biology. Like the 
microscope, math and computers provide tools to explore the complexity of biology and 
biological systems, offering deeper insights to and understanding of what makes living 
systems work. Even the incredible complexity of evolution in populations is illuminated 
by relatively simple ma
