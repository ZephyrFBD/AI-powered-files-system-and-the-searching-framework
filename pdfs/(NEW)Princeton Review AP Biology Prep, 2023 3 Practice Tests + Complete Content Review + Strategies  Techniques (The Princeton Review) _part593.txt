gression, an inactive CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) binds a regulatory cyclin. Once
together, the complex is activated, can affect many proteins in the cell, and causes the cell cycle to continue.
To do this, the CDK transfers phosphate groups onto other molecules. If there are adequate phosphate groups,
CDK would function properly and the cell cycle would progress, which rules out (A). Oncogenes keep cells
from going through apoptosis, so the cycle would not be stopped, which rules out (B). To inhibit cell cycle
progression, CDKs and cyclins are kept separate. Together, they promote the cell cycle. If a cyclin is unable to
release from its cyclin dependent kinase, the cell cycle would be promoted, not stopped, which rules out (C).
Choice (D) is correct because an inhibitor of a cyclin gene would prevent expression of the cyclin gene. With
lower levels of the cyclin protein, cell cycle progression would be inhibited.

Because neurons are not capable of dividing, it is reasonable t
