n the cell address D2. It will save time later 
when you build onto this spreadsheet. 
The formula in this cell basically says that if a random number between 0 and 1 is less 
than or equal to the value of p, then put an A gamete in this cell, or if it is not less than 
or equal to the value of p, put a B gamete in this cell. IF functions and RAND functions 
are very powerful tools when you try to build models for biology. 
Now create the same formula in cell F5, making sure that it is formatted exactly like 
E5. When you have this completed, press the recalculate key to force a recalculation of 
your spreadsheet. If you have entered the functions correctly in the two cells, you should 
see changing values in the two cells. (This is part of the testing and retesting that you 
have to do while model building.) Your spreadsheet should look like Figure 3. 
Try recalculating 10â€“20 times. Are your results consistent with what you expect? Do 
both cells (E5 and F5) change to A or B in the ra
