be applied to each. The person exerts a force 
on box A. Box A exerts a
force 
on the connecting cord, and the cord exerts an opposite but equal 
magnitude force 
back on box A (Newton’s third law). The two horizontal
forces on box A are shown in Fig. 4–22b, along with the force of gravity 
downward and the normal force 
exerted upward by the table. The cord is
light, so we neglect its mass. The tension at each end of the cord is thus the same.
Hence the cord exerts a force 
on the second box. Figure 4–22c shows the
forces on box B, which are 
and the normal force 
There will be
only horizontal motion. We take the positive x axis to the right.
SOLUTION (a) We apply  
to box A:
[box A]
For box B, the only horizontal force is 
so
[box B]
The boxes are connected, and if the cord remains taut and doesn’t stretch, then
the two boxes will have the same acceleration a. Thus
We are
given
and
We can add the two equations above 
to eliminate an unknown 
and obtain
or
This is what we sought.
