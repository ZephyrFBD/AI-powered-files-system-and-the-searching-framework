teins end up inside a vacuole 
for storage but not explain further details of how they 
function for the plant being in the vacuole.
Free ribosome (location and function): 
The student is able to write a paragraph to explain how 
a protein produced on the free ribosome may ultimately 
end up in the cytosol or a vacuole as a structural protein 
to function in the cytoskeleton or as a motor protein in 
the cell. The student may also mention that the proteins in 
the vacuole function as an enzyme. Also included in the 
explanation could be how the location of the protein in the 
nucleus can function as a transcription factor or with DNA.
Characteristics of a 
WEAK Response 
The student may mention the location but not the function 
or vice versa, and the identifications and explanations will  
be brief. 
Attached ribosome (location and function): 
The student is able to explain how a protein produced on 
the attached ribosome may end up as a protein excreted 
from the cell. The student ma
