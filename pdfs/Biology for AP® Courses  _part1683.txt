 differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.
Initiation of Translation
Protein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. In E. coli, this complex involves the small 30S
ribosome, the mRNA template, three initiation factors (IFs; IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), and a special initiator tRNA, called
tRNAf
Met . The initiator tRNA interacts with the start codon AUG (or rarely, GUG), links to a formylated methionine
called fMet, and can also bind IF-2. Formylated methionine is inserted by fMet âˆ’tRNAf
Met at the beginning of every
polypeptide chain synthesized by E. coli, but it is usually clipped off after translation is complete. When an in-frame AUG
is encountered during translation elongation, a non-formylated methionine is inserted by a regular Met-tRNAMet.
In E. coli mRNA, a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon, called the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG), interacts
with the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome. This interaction anchors the 30S riboso
