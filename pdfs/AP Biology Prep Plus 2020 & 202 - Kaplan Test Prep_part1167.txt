% of the bases are adenine and
thymine, which each occur at the same rate. That means that 46% รท 2 =
23% of the nucleotide bases are thymine. Therefore, (A) is correct.

Comparative anatomy is one tool that biologists use to assess how
recently two species might have shared a common ancestor. If two
organisms have the same or similarly derived anatomical features, they
are considered to have homologous structures. For instance, despite
humans having arms and bats having wings, they share the same arm
bones and are thus considered to have a common ancestor. In convergent
evolution, however, distantly related organisms can evolve analogous
structures that perform the same function but are structurally and
developmentally distinct from each other. Thus, (C) is correct because it
suggests the dewlaps of species D and E are analogous to the other
anoles, and not homologous. (A) is incorrect because interbreeding would
be evidence of a very close evolutionary relationship. (B) is incorr
