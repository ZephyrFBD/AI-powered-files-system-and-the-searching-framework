 more than two sets of chromosomes). It may

6. Scoring Guidelines for Free-Response Question 6
(a) Identify the amino acid before and aȇer the mutation at codon 142 in
the alpha globin. (1 point)
Identification (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The point mutation at codon 142 in the alpha globin changed a U to a C.
According to the tables, codon 142 before the mutation was UAA, which
codes for a stop codon ( no amino acid), and after the mutation was CAA,
which codes for GLN.
(b) Describe how the structure and function of hemoglobins are aﬀected
by the mutation at codon 142. (1 point)
Description (1 point)
Codon 142 before the mutation coded for a stop codon (no amino acid) and aȇer the
mutation coded for amino acid GLN.
Description (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The mutation at codon 142 in the alpha globin changes UAA (STOP) to CAA
(gln), which may create an elongate
