e greatest
fungal colonization is Polygonum pubescens. The data suggest that no
treatment and the presence of neighbors result in greater colonization.
Thus, Polygonum pubescens under those conditions would produce the
greatest amount of oxygen.
Polygonum pubescens (no treatment +
neighbors)
The bars with the greatest percent of
fungal colonization rate correspond to the
gray and black bars (no fungicide
treatment)Â 
2. Scoring Guidelines for Free-Response Question 2
(a) Identify which ecosystem has the highest gross primary productivity.
Describe one factor that contributes to high gross primary productivity.
(2 points maximum)
Identification (1 points)
Description (1 point each, 1 point maximum)
Tropical rainforest (highest amount of
energy at 17,450 kj/m2)
Warmer temperatures increase the rate of
enzymatic light independent-reactions in
photosynthesis
High precipitation increases the rate of
photosynthesis from photolysis of water
