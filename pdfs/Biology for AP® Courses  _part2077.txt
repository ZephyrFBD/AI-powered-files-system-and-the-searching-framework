d.
Changes in the genes that are important to
embryonic development have been relatively
minor because mutational tweaking in the
embryo has magnified consequences in the adult
52. The upper forelimbs of humans and cats have fairly
similar structures. In contrast, the upper forelimbs of
whales (their flippers) have bones with a different shape
and proportion from both cats and humans. Interestingly,
genetic data suggests that all three organisms have a
common ancestor from about the same point in time. What
is a likely explanation for these data?
a.
Cats and humans are more closely related to
each other than either are to whales.
b.
The shape of the whale forelimb arose a result of
disadvantageous mutations
c.
The whale flipper is an adaptive characteristic
unique to its water environment.
d.
The whale flipper is a vestigial structure.
