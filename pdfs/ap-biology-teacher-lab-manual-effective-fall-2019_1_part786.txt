red over time. In a decomposition reaction of 
peroxide by peroxidase (as noted in the above formula), the easiest molecule to measure 
is oxygen gas, a final product. This can be done by measuring the actual volume of 
oxygen gas released or by using an indicator. In this experiment an indicator for oxygen 
will be used. The compound guaiacol has a high affinity for oxygen, and in solution, 
it binds instantly with oxygen to form tetraguaiacol, which is brownish in color. The 
greater the amount of oxygen produced, the darker brown the solution will become. 
Qualifying color is a difficult task, but a series of dilutions can be made and then 
combined on a palette, which can represent the relative changes occurring in the 
reaction. A color palette ranging from 1 to 10 (Figure 1) is sufficient to compare relative 
amounts of oxygen produced, or the color change can be recorded as a change in 
absorbency using a variety of available meters, such as a spectrophotometer or a probe
