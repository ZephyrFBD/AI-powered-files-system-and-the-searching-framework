process.
After approximately 5,730 years, half of the starting concentration of 14C will have been converted back to
14N. The time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay back to its more stable
form is called its half-life. Because the half-life of 14C is long, it is used to date formerly living objects such
as old bones or wood. Comparing the ratio of the 14C concentration found in an object to the amount of 14C
detected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope that has not yet decayed can be determined. On the
basis of this amount, the age of the material, such as the pygmy mammoth shown in Figure 2.4, can be
calculated with accuracy if it is not much older than about 50,000 years. Other elements have isotopes with
different half lives. For example, 40K (potassium-40) has a half-life of 1.25 billion years, and 235U (Uranium
235) has a half-life of about 700 million years. Through the use of radiometric dating, scientists can study
the age of fossil
