cromolecules from smaller molecules. Phototrophs obtain their energy from sunlight, whereas chemotrophs obtain
energy from chemical compounds.
Prokaryotes play roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Carbon is returned to the atmosphere by the respiration of
animals and other chemoorganotrophic organisms. Consumers use organic compounds generated by producers and release
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The most important contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is microbial
decomposition of dead material. Nitrogen is recycled in nature from organic compounds to ammonia, ammonium ions,
nitrite, nitrate, and nitrogen gas. Gaseous nitrogen is transformed into ammonia through nitrogen fixation. Ammonia is
anaerobically catabolized by some prokaryotes, yielding N2 as the final product. Nitrification is the conversion of
ammonium into nitrite. Nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria. Denitrification is also performed by bacteria and
transforms nitrate from soils into ga
