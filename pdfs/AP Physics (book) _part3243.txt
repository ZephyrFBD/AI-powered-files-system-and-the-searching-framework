ts of the cell and as enzymes to catalyze
chemical reactions needed for the growth and survival of the organism. A protein
molecule consists of one or more chains of small molecules known as amino acids.
There are 20 different amino acids, and a single protein chain may contain 
hundreds of them in a specific order. The standard model for how amino acids
are connected together in the correct order to form a protein molecule is shown
schematically in Fig. 29–13.
We begin at the DNA double helix: each gene on a chromosome contains the
information for producing one protein. The ordering of the four bases, A, C, G,
and T, provides the “code,” the genetic code, for the order of amino acids in 
the protein. First, the DNA double helix unwinds and a new molecule called
messenger-RNA (m-RNA) is synthesized using one strand of the DNA as a
“template.” m-RNA is a chain molecule containing four different bases, like
those of DNA (Section 16–10) except that thymine (T) is replaced by the similar
