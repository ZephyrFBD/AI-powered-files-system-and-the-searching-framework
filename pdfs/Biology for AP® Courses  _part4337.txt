many individuals of reproductive age can increase birth rates.
In addition, the demographic characteristics of a population can influence how the population grows or declines over time.
If birth and death rates are equal, the population remains stable. However, the population size will increase if birth rates
exceed death rates; the population will decrease if birth rates are less than death rates. Life expectancy is another important
factor; the length of time individuals remain in the population impacts local resources, reproduction, and the overall health
of the population. These demographic characteristics are often displayed in the form of a life table.
Life Tables
Life tables provide important information about the life history of an organism. Life tables divide the population into age
groups and often sexes, and show how long a member of that group is likely to live. They are modeled after actuarial tables
