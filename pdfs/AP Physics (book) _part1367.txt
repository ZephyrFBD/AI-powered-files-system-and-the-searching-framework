12–7 Doppler Effect
56. (I) The predominant frequency of a certain fire truck’s
siren is 1650 Hz when at rest. What frequency do you detect
if you move with a speed of 
(a) toward the fire
truck, and (b) away from it?
57. (II) A bat at rest sends out ultrasonic sound waves at
50.0 kHz and receives them returned from an object
moving directly away from it at 
What is the
received sound frequency?
58. (II) Two automobiles are equipped with the same single-
frequency horn. When one is at rest and the other is
moving toward the first at 
the driver at rest hears a
beat frequency of 4.5 Hz. What is the frequency the horns
emit? Assume
59. (II) As a bat flies toward a wall at a speed of 
the
bat emits an ultrasonic sound wave with frequency 30.0 kHz.
What frequency does the bat hear in the reflected wave?
60. (II) In
