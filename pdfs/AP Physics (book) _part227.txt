72. In the design of a rapid transit system, it is necessary to
balance the average speed of a train against the distance
between station stops. The more stops there are, the slower
the train’s average speed. To get an idea of this problem,
calculate the time it takes a train to make a 15.0-km trip
in two situations: (a) the stations at which the trains must
stop are 3.0 km apart (a total of 6 stations, including those
at the ends); and (b) the stations are 5.0 km apart (4 stations
total). Assume that at each station the train accelerates at
a rate of 
until it reaches 
then stays at
this speed until its brakes are applied for arrival at the next
station, at which time it decelerates at 
Assume
it stops at each intermediate station for 22 s.
