 with only blue geese, the population would
evolve quickly, favoring blue geese.

Natural selection is the major mechanism of evolution in any population.
Those individuals who are better adapted in a particular environment
exhibit better reproductive success. They have more offspring that survive
and pass their genes on to more offspring.

Natural selection acts on phenotypic variations in populations.
HARDY-WEINBERG EQUILIBRIUMâ€”
CHARACTERISTICS OF STABLE POPULATIONS
Hardy and Weinberg, two scientists, described the characteristics of a
stable, nonevolving population, that is, one in which allelic frequencies
do not change. For example, if the frequency of an allele for a particular
trait is 0.5 and the population is not evolving, in 1,000 years the frequency
of that allele will still be 0.5.
According to Hardy-Weinberg, if the population is stable, the following
must be true:
THE POPULATION MUST BE VERY
