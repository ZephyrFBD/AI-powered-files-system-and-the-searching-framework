he units label when writing your answer.
Now try a tricky question that fooled many students some years ago on
the AP exam:
Using the same graph and reaction, calculate the rate of product formed
from 40 to 50 seconds.
19 moles−19 moles50 sec−40 sec=010=0.0 moles per second
The reason that no product formed is because the substrate was used up.
CHI-SQUARE TEST AND NULL HYPOTHESIS
A chi-square (χ2) test compares your observed experimental data (o) to
what you expected (e) and tells you if the two are statistically the same
(due to chance) or statistically different (due to experimental error).
The equation from the reference table is: (chi-squared) χ2 = (sum) ∑ =
(o – e)2 ÷ e.
Degrees of freedom are equal to the number of distinct possible outcomes
minus 1. If you expect two outcomes (i.e., black fur and white fur), that is
one degree of freedom. If you expect black, white, and gray fur, there are
three outcomes and two degrees of freedom. You need to determine
degrees of freedom in ord
