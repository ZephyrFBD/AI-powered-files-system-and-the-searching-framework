a of higher water potential to an area of lower water
potential. Water would flow into the turnip cells, and the turnips would gain mass. Turnips placed in
solutions with a lower water potential than the turnip cells would have a negative percent change in mass
because water would flow out of the turnip cells into the surrounding solution and the turnips would lose
mass.
TIP
Remember to always use temperatures in Kelvin when calculating water potential!
(b) The molarity of the turnip cell would be about 0.45 molar. The line of best fit crosses the x-axis at the
coordinates (0.45 molar, 0%), which indicates a 0.45 solution that would be isotonic to a turnip cell and in
which a turnip cell would have 0% change in mass.
(c) The line of best fit crosses the x-axis at approximately 0.45 molar, so that would be the best estimate of the
concentration of solutes in a turnip cell. Since the turnip is open to the atmosphere, the pressure potential is
0. The water potential of the turnip cell wou
