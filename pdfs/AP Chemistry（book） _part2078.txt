phase diagram of a solution and, 
hence, its boiling and freezing points differ from that of the pure solvent? The addition 
of a nonvolatile solute lowers the vapor pressure of the solution. Thus, in Figure 13.20 the 
vapor–pressure curve of the solution is shifted downward relative to the vapor–pressure 
curve of the pure solvent.
Solutions sometimes have two or more volatile components. Gaso-
line, for example, is a solution of several volatile liquids. To gain some 
understanding of such mixtures, consider an ideal solution of two 
volatile liquids, A and B. (For our purposes here, it does not matter 
which we call the solute and which the solvent.) The partial pressures 
above the solution are given by Raoult’s law:
P
A = XAP°
A     and    P
B = XBP°
B
and the total vapor pressure above the solution is
P
total = P
A + P
B = XAP°
A + XBP°
B
Consider a mixture of 1.0 mol of benzene 1C6H62 and 2.0 mol of 
toluene 1C7H82 1Xben = 0.33, Xtol = 0.672. At 20 °C, the vapor pres-
