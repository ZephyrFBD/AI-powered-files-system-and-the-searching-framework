are no numbers that occur more than once,
there is no mode. If there are multiple numbers that occur most frequently, each of those numbers is a mode. The
mode must be one of the numbers in the sample, and modes are never averaged.
The range is the difference between the smallest and largest number in a sample. This value is less useful than
standard deviation, because it does not give any information on individual values or the majority of values.
Example 1: Eleven male laboratory mice were weighed at 32 weeks of age. The data collected was: 32 g, 28 g, 29
g, 34 g, 30 g, 28 g, 32 g, 31 g, 30 g, 32 g, 33 g. What is the mean, median, and mode of this dataset?
Solution: Letâ€™s start by putting the 11 numbers in the dataset in order, from smallest value to largest value: 28 g, 28
g, 29 g, 30 g, 30 g, 31 g, 32 g, 32 g, 32 g, 33 g, 34 g. The mean is
The median is the middle value, or 31 g. The mode is the most frequent number, or 32 g.
Example 2: In the following set of values, what is the r
