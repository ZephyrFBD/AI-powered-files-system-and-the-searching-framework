Ultrasound Medical Imaging
The diagnostic use of ultrasound in medicine, in the form of images (sometimes
called sonograms), is an important and interesting application of physical princi-
ples. A pulse-echo technique is used, much like sonar, except that the frequencies
used are in the range of 1 to 10 MHz
A high-frequency sound
pulse is directed into the body, and its reflections from boundaries or interfaces
between organs and other structures and lesions in the body are then detected.
Tumors and other abnormal growths, or pockets of fluid, can be distinguished;
the action of heart valves and the development of a fetus (Fig. 12â€“26) can be exam-
