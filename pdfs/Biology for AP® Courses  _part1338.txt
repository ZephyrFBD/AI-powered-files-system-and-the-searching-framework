 allele is only lethal in the homozygous form and in which the heterozygote may be normal
or have some altered non-lethal phenotype is referred to as recessive lethal.
For crosses between heterozygous individuals with a recessive lethal allele that causes death before birth when homozygous,
only wild-type homozygotes and heterozygotes would be observed. The genotypic ratio would therefore be 2:1. In other
instances, the recessive lethal allele might also exhibit a dominant (but not lethal) phenotype in the heterozygote. For
instance, the recessive lethal Curly allele in Drosophila affects wing shape in the heterozygote form but is lethal in the
homozygote.
A single copy of the wild-type allele is not always sufficient for normal functioning or even survival. The dominant lethal
inheritance pattern is one in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote; this allele can only be
transmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age. Individuals with
