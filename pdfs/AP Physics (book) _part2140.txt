ate when the patient is
exercising, which statement below is true? The capacitor
(a) needs to discharge faster, so the resistance should be
decreased.
(b) needs to discharge faster, so the resistance should be
increased.
(c) needs to discharge slower, so the resistance should be
decreased.
(d) needs to discharge slower, so the resistance should be
increased.
(e) does not affect the timing, regardless of the resistance.
13. Why is an appliance cord with a three-prong plug safer than
one with two prongs?
(a) The 120 V from the outlet is split among three wires,
so it isnâ€™t as high a voltage as when it is only split
between two wires.
(b) Three prongs fasten more securely to the wall outlet.
(c) The third prong grounds the case, so the case cannot
reach a high voltage.
(d) The third prong acts as a ground wire, so the 
electrons have an easier time leaving the appliance. As
a result, fewer electrons build up in the appliance.
(e) The third prong controls the capacitance of the
appliance,
