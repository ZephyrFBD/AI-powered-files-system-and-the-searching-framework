ike all biological molecules, the elements that make up water determine the properties of water. Water has two
hydrogen atoms joined to an oxygen atom.
In water molecules, the electrons are not shared equally in the bonds between hydrogen and oxygen. This means that
the hydrogen atoms have a partial positive charge and the oxygen atom has a partial negative charge. Molecules that
have partially positive and partially negative charges are said to be polar. Water is therefore a polar molecule. The
positively charged elements of the water molecules strongly attract the negatively charged ends of other polar
compounds (including water). Likewise, the negatively charged ends strongly attract the positively charged ends of
polar compounds. These forces are most readily apparent in the tendency of water molecules to stick together, as in
the formation of water beads or raindrops.
These types of intermolecular attractions are called hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds are weak chemical bonds that
