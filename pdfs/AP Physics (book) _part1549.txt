imes used to improve circulation. The air throughout
the room also becomes heated as a result of convection. The air heated by the
radiators rises and is replaced by cooler air, resulting in convective air currents,
as shown by the green arrows in Fig. 14–9.
Other types of furnaces also depend on convection. Hot-air furnaces with
registers (openings) near the floor often do not have fans but depend on natural
convection, which can be appreciable. In other systems, a fan is used. In either
case, it is important that cold air can return to the furnace so that convective cur-
rents circulate throughout the room if the room is to be uniformly heated.
The human body produces a great deal of thermal energy. Of the food energy
transformed within the body, at best 20% is used to do work, so over 80% appears
as thermal energy. During light activity, for example, if this thermal energy were not
dissipated, the body temperature would rise about 3 C° per hour. Clearly, the heat
generated by the bo
