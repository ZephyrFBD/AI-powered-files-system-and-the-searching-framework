ending in the rectum.

Elimination
The final step in digestion is the elimination of undigested food content and waste products. The undigested food material
enters the colon, where most of the water is reabsorbed. Recall that the colon is also home to the microflora called “intestinal
flora” that aid in the digestion process. The semi-solid waste is moved through the colon by peristaltic movements of the
muscle and is stored in the rectum. As the rectum expands in response to storage of fecal matter, it triggers the neural signals
required to set u
