ls to fluoresce, or to give off light.
Experiments showed that cathode rays are deflected by electric or magnetic 
fields in a way consistent with there being a stream of negative electrical charge. 
The British scientist J. J. Thomson (1856–1940) observed that cathode rays are the 
same regardless of the identity of the cathode material. In a paper published in 1897, 
Thomson described cathode rays as streams of negatively charged particles that we 
now call electrons.

of silicon. The image was obtained by 
a technique called scanning tunneling 
microscopy. The color was added to the 
image by computer to help distinguish its 
features. Each gold sphere is a silicon atom.

If the fluorescent screen were removed from the tube, would cathode rays still 
be generated? Would you be able to see them?

If no magnetic field were applied, would you expect the electron beam to be 
deflected upwar
