 energy is released during the process. We therefore say that the electron 
affinity of Cl is -349 kJ>mol.*
 
Electron affinity:  Cl1g2 + e- ยก Cl-1g2  
EA = -349 kJ>mol

It is important to understand the difference between ionization energy and electron 
affinity:
t
Ionization energy measures the energy change when an atom loses an electron.
t Electron affinity measures the energy change when an atom gains an electron.
Write the electron configurations for (a) Ca2+, (b) Co3+, and (c) S2-.
Sample Exercise 7.7 
Electron Configurations of Ions
SOLUTION
Analyze and Plan We are asked to write electron configurations 
for three ions. To do so, we first write the electron configuration 
of each parent atom and then remove or add electrons to form 
the ions.  
Electrons are first removed from the orbitals having the 
highest value of n. They are added to the empty or partially filled 
orbitals having the lowest value of n.
