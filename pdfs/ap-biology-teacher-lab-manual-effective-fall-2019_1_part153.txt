have to make where your quantitative skills will be tested. For instance, what should 
you do about plants with 0 plant hairs? Do you include a separate bin for this one plant? 
How do you know what the “correct” bin size is? It is usually best to try several bin 
sizes, but you’ll have to make the decision which bin size best captures the nature of the 
variation you are working with — messy. 
■Creating Diagrams, Charts, and Maps
Biology is the study of systems at several levels of organization, from molecules and
cells to populations and ecosystems. When exploring a topic, such as energy dynamics
in Investigation 10, creating a chart or map can help you to logically define the system
components and the flows between those components, while simplifying a very
complicated process. Creating such a chart is an exercise in logic and graphic design.
Such a graphic representation o
