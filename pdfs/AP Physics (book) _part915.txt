Straightening teeth. The wire band shown in Fig. 9–3a has
a tension 
of 2.0 N along it. It therefore exerts forces of 2.0 N on the high-
lighted tooth (to which it is attached) in the two directions shown. Calculate the
resultant force on the tooth due to the wire, F

APPROACH Since the two forces 
are equal, their sum will be directed along
the line that bisects the angle between them, which we have chosen to be the
y axis. The x components of the two forces add up to zero.
SOLUTION The y component of each
