 when present as two identical copies, the recessive trait is expressed
inheritance pattern in which an allele is only lethal in the homozygous form; the heterozygote may be
normal or have some altered, non-lethal phenotype
paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the respective
traits of the female and male in the other cross
any gene on a sex chromosome
probability of the occurrence of at least one of two mutually exclusive events is the sum of their individual
probabilities
cross between a dominant expressing individual with an unknown genotype and a homozygous recessive
individual; the offspring phenotypes indicate whether the unknown parent is heterozygous or homozygous for the
dominant trait
variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic
gene present on the X, but not the Y chromosome

12.1 Mendelâ€™s Experiments and the Laws of Probability
Working with garden pea plants, Mendel found that crosses betw
