soporous materials have much smaller pores that 
are not visible to the naked eye. Microporous solids have pores up 
to 2 nm in size, whereas mesoporous solids have pore sizes in the 
range 2 to 50 nm.
Microporous and mesoporous materials have a large surface 
area relative to their volume because of their numerous pores and 
cavities. Nanomaterials, on the other hand, have a large surface 
area relative to their volume because of their small particle size. The 
size-dependent properties of these materials has led researchers to in-
vestigate their fundamental science and application.
Zeolites, which occur naturally and can also be synthesized, 
are a class of aluminosilicates that have been known since 1756. 
There are several hundred types of microporous and mesoporous ze-
olites. These substances adopt a variety of structures with polyhedral 
cavities connected by tunnels that often resemble a honeycomb [Fig-
ure 12.46(c)]. The interior surfaces attract ions and molecules that
