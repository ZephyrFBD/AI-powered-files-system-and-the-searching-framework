related to the presence of d electrons in the metal cat-
ion. In this section, we consider a model for bonding in transition-metal complexes, 
crystal-field theory, that accounts for many of the observed properties of these sub-
stances.* Because many predictions of crystal-field theory are qualitatively the same 
as those obtained with more advanced molecular-orbital theories, crystal-field theory 
is an excellent place to start in considering the electronic structure of coordination 
compounds.
The attraction of a ligand to a metal ion is essentially a Lewis acid–base interaction in 
which the base—that is, the ligand—donates a pair of electrons to an empty orbital on the 
metal ion (Figure 23.27). Much of the attractive interaction between the metal ion and the 
ligands is due, however, to the electrostatic forces between the positive charge on the metal 
ion and negative charges on the ligands. An ionic ligand, such as Cl- or SCN-, experiences 
the usual cation–anion attraction. Wh
