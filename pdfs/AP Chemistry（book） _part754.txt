epends only on the amount of matter that undergoes change and on 
the nature of the initial state of the reactants and the final state of the products. This 
means that whether a particular reaction is carried out in one step or in a series of steps, 
the sum of the enthalpy changes associated with the individual steps must be the same 
as the enthalpy change associated with the one-step process. As an example, combustion 
of methane gas, CH41g2, to form CO21g2 and H2O1l2 can be thought of as occurring in 
one step, as represented on the left in Figure 5.21, or in two steps, as represented on the 
right in Figure 5.21: (1) combustion of CH41g2 to form CO21g2 and H2O1g2 and (2) con-
densation of H2O1g2 to form H2O1l2. The enthalpy change for the overall process is the 
sum of the enthalpy changes for these two steps:
 
CH41g2 + 2 O21g2 ¡  CO21g2 + 2 H2O1g2 
∆H = -802 kJ
1Add2  
2 H2O1g2 ¡  2 H2O1l2 
∆H = -88 kJ
CH41g2 + 2 O21g2 + 2 H2O1g2 ¡  CO21g2 + 2 H2O1l2 + 2 H2O1g2 
∆H = -890 kJ
