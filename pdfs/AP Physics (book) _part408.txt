 We use the definitions of sine (“side opposite”)
and cosine (“side adjacent”) to obtain the components:
where 
is in the negative y direction. To calculate the skier’s acceleration down
the hill,
we apply Newton’s second law to the x direction:
where the two forces are the x component of the gravity force (
direction)
and the friction force (
direction). We want to find the value of 
but we
don’t yet know 
in the last equation. Let’s see if we can get 
from the
y component of Newton’s second law:
where we set
because there is no motion in the y direction (perpendic-
ular to the slope). Thus we can solve for 
and we can substitute this into our equation above for 
There is an m in each term which can be canceled out. Thus (setting
and
):
The skier’s acceleration is 0.41 times the acceleration of gravity, which in numbers†
is
NOTE The mass canceled out, so we have the useful conclusion that the accelera-
tion doesn’t depend on the mass. That such a cancellation sometimes occurs, and
