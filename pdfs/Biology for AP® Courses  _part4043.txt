ving nourishment from the motherâ€™s blood through a placenta. The
offspring develops in the female and is born alive. This occurs in most mammals, some cartilaginous fish, and a few reptiles.
Internal fertilization has the advantage of protecting the fertilized egg from dehydration on land. The embryo is isolated
within the female, which limits predation on the young. Internal fertilization enhances the fertilization of eggs by a specific
male. Fewer offspring are produced through this method, but their survival rate is higher than that for external fertilization.
The Evolution of Reproduction
Once multicellular organisms evolved and developed specialized cells, some also developed tissues and organs with
specialized functions. An early development in reproduction occurred in the Annelids. These organisms produce sperm and
eggs from undifferentiated cells in their coelom and store them in that cavity. When the coelom becomes filled, the cells are
