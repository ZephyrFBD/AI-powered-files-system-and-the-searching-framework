fix bi-. Thus, 
the HCO3
- ion is commonly called the bicarbonate ion, and HSO4
- is sometimes 
called the bisulfate ion.
The names and formulas of the common anions are listed in Table 2.5 
and on the back inside cover of the text. Those anions whose names end in 
-ide are listed on the left portion of Table 2.5, and those whose names end 
in -ate are listed on the right. The most common of these ions are shown 
in boldface. You should learn the names and formulas of these anions first. 
 
The formulas of the ions whose names end with -ite can be derived from 
those ending in -ate by removing an O atom. Notice the location of the 
 
monatomic ions in the periodic table. Those of group 7A always have a 
1- charge 1F-, Cl-, Br-, and I-2, and those of group 6A have a 2- charge 
1O2- and S2-2.
 
Sample Exercise 2.11 
Determining the Formula of an Oxyanion from Its Name
Based on the formula for the sulfate ion, predict the formula for (a) the selenate ion and (b) the selenite ion. (Sulfur
