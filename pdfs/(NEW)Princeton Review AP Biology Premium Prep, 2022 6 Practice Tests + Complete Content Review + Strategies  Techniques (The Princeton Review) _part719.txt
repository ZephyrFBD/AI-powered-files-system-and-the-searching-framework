Question 1
a. Describe why a cell membrane is semipermeable. Include examples of molecules that can/cannot pass
through. (2 points)
Cells are semipermeable because certain things can pass through them and some cannot. The membrane is made of
a phospholipid bilayer. This means hydrophobic things like oxygen can pass through and hydrophilic things like water and
ions cannot pass through without assistance, such as a channel.
b. Bacterial cells contain a Na+/K+ ATPase pump that helps them maintain an osmotic balance with their
surroundings. In the experimental cells, glycolysis was inhibited to prevent sodium from being pump
