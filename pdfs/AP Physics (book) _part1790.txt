n area. For a uniform electric field 
passing through
an area A, as shown in Fig. 16–43a, the electric flux 
is defined as
where 
is the angle between the electric field direction and a line drawn per-
pendicular to the area. The flux can be written equivalently as
(16;7)
where 
is the component of 
perpendicular to the area 
(Fig. 16–43b) and, similarly,
is the projection of the area A
perpendicular to the field 
(Fig. 16–43c).
Electric flux can be interpretated in terms of field lines. We mentioned in
Section 16–8 that field lines can always be drawn so that the number (N) passing
through unit area perpendicular to the field 
is proportional to the magnitude
of the field (E): that is,
Hence,
(16;8)
so the flux through an area is proportional to the number of lines passing through
that area.
