Moreover, spraying with pesticides
ensures the development of resistant strains of pests through natural
selection. The pests come back stronger than before. This problem requires
that we spray more and more, which means more people will be exposed
to these toxic chemicals.
An alternative to widescale spraying with pesticides is called biological
control. The following are some biological methods of getting rid of pests
without using dangerous chemicals:
Use crop rotation—change the crop planted in a field.
Introduce natural enemies of the pests—you must be careful,
however, that you do not disrupt a delicate ecological balance by
introducing an invasive species.
Use natural plant toxins instead of synthetic ones.
Use insect birth control—male insect pests can be sterilized by
exposing them to radiation and then releasing them into the
environment to mate unsuccessfully with females.
