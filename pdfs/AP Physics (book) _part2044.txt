1. Why is Ohm’s law less of a law than Newton’s laws?
2. A traditional incandescent lamp filament may have been lit
to a temperature of 2700 K. A contemporary halogen
incandescent lamp filament may be at around 2900 K.
(a) Estimate the percent improvement of the halogen bulb
over the traditional one. [Hint: See Section 14–8.] (b) To
produce the same amount of light as a traditional 100-W
bulb, estimate what wattage a halogen bulb should use.
3. You find a small cylindrical resistor that measures 9.00 mm
in length and 2.15 mm in diameter, and it has a color code
of red, yellow, brown, and gold. What is the resistor made
of primarily?
4. Small changes in the length of an object can be measured
using a strain gauge sensor, which is a wire that when
undeformed has length 
cross-sectional area 
and
resistance 
This sensor is rigidly affixed to the object’s
surface, aligning its length in the direction in which length
changes are to be measured. As the object deforms, the
length
