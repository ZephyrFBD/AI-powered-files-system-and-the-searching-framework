 machine. A photocopy machine works by
arranging positive charges (in the pattern to be copied) on the surface of a drum,
then gently sprinkling negatively charged dry toner (ink) particles onto the drum.
The toner particles temporarily stick to the pattern on the drum (Fig. 16–25) and
are later transferred to paper and “melted” to produce the copy. Suppose each
toner particle has a mass of 
and carries an average of 20 extra
electrons to provide an electric charge. Assuming that the electric force on a
toner particle must exceed twice its weight in order to ensure sufficient attraction,
compute the required electric field strength near the surface of the drum.
APPROACH The electric force on a toner particle of charge 
is
where E is the needed electric field. This force needs to be at least as great as
twice the weight (mg) of the particle.
SOLUTION The minimum value of electric field satisfies the relation
where  
Hence
E = 2mg
