 18.92  The pH of a particular raindrop is 5.6. (a) Assuming the 
major species in the raindrop are H2CO31aq2, HCO3
-1aq2, 
and CO3 
2-1aq2, calculate the concentrations of these 
species in the raindrop, assuming the total carbonate 
concentration is 1.0 * 10-5 M. The appropriate Ka values 
are given in Table 16.3. (b) What experiments could 
you do to test the hypothesis that the rain also contains 
sulfur-containing species that contribute to its pH? Assume 
you have a large sample of rain to test.

Considerable fracking of petroleum/gas wells (see Closer Look box 
in Section 18.4) has occurred in recent years in a particular rural 
area. The residents have complained that the water in the residen-
tial wells serving their domestic water needs has become contami-
nated with chemicals associated with the fracking operations. The 
well operators respond that the chemicals about which complaints 
are lodged occur naturally, and
