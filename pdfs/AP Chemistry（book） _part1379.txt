Lewis structure that one electron 
domain is due to a nonbonding pair, which occupies one of the four vertices of the tetra-
hedron. In determining the molecular geometry, we consider only the three N¬H bond 
domains, which leads to a trigonal pyramidal geometry. The situation is just like the 
middle drawing in Figure 9.4 in which removing one atom from a tetrahedral molecule 
results in a trigonal pyramidal molecule. Notice that the tetrahedral arrangement of the 
four electron domains leads us to predict the trigonal-pyramidal molecular geometry.
Because the trigonal-pyramidal molecular geometry is based on a tetrahedral electron- 
domain geometry, the ideal bond angles are 109.5°. As we will soon see, bond angles deviate 
from ideal values when the surrounding atoms and electron domains are not identical.
As one more example, let’s determine the shape of the CO2 molecule. Its Lewis struc-
ture reveals two electron domains (each one a double bond) around the central carbon:
