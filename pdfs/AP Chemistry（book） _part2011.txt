) Determine the average 
spacing in J between energy levels in the copper metal in 
part (a). (c) Is this spacing larger, substantially smaller, or 
about the same as the 1 * 10–18 J separation between en-
ergy levels in a hydrogen atom?

Hydrogen bonding between polyamide chains plays an 
important role in determining the properties of a ny-
lon such as nylon 6,6 (Table 12.6). Draw the structural 
formulas for two adjacent chains of nylon 6,6 and show 
where hydrogen-bonding interactions could occur be-
tween them.
