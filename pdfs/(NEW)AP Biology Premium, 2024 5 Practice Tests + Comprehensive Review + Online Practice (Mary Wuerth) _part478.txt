Which of the following is the most likely cause of the observed change in allele frequencies?
(A) artificial selection
(B) natural selection
(C) genetic drift
(D) gene flow
6. The following table shows the frequency of three genotypes (AA, Aa, and aa) in a population.
Genotype
Frequency
AA
0.44
Aa
0.14
aa
0.42
The environment of the population changes so that individuals with the Aa genotype are more likely to survive
and reproduce. Predict what would most likely happen to the frequencies of the AA and aa genotypes after 10
generations in this environment.
(A) The frequencies of both the AA and aa genotypes would increase.
(B) The frequencies of both the AA and aa genotypes would decrease.
(C) The frequency of the AA genotype would increa
