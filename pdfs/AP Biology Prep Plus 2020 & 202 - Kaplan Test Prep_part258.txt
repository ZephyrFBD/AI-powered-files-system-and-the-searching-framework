ght energy needed for photosynthesis. Shoots
generally exhibit positive phototropism or growth toward a light source,
while roots generally exhibit negative phototropism or growth away from
light.
During phototropism, light is sensed at the coleoptile (the tip of a plant)
and detected by blue-light photoreceptors called phototropins, which
 are composed of a protein bound to a light-absorbing pigment called the
chromophore. The absorption of light by the chromophore causes the
protein shape to change and activate a signaling pathway. The diﬀerent

levels of phototropin activation, in turn, cause unequal transport of
auxin, a plant hormone that promotes cell elongation, down the sides of
the coleoptile. More auxin is transported down the side that is away from
the light than the illuminated side, which causes the plant to bend in the
direction of
