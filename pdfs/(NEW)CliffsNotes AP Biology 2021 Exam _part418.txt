Genetic (Hardy-Weinberg) Equilibrium
When the allele frequencies in a population remain constant from generation to generation, the population is said to
be in genetic equilibrium, or Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. At genetic equilibrium, there is no evolution. In order
for equilibrium to occur, the factors that normally change gene frequencies do not occur. Thus, the following
conditions hold:
1. All traits are selectively neutral (no natural selection).
2. Mutations do not occur.
3. The population must be isolated from other populations (no gene flow).
4. The population is large (no genetic drift).
5. Mating is random.
Genetic equilibrium is determined by evaluating the following values:
1. Allele frequencies for each allele (p, q)
2. Frequency of homozygotes (p2, q2)
3. Frequency of heterozygotes (pq + qp = 2pq)
Also, the following two equations hold:
1. p + q = 1 (all alleles sum to 100%)
2. p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 (all individuals sum to 100%)
