aptive response when antibodies are
produced
binding of an antibody to an epitope corresponding to an antigen that is different from the one the
antibody was raised against
chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation, proliferation, gene expression, and cell trafficking to
effect immune responses
adaptive immune cell that directly kills infected cells via perforin and granzymes, and
releases cytokines to enhance the immune response
immune cell that processes antigen material and presents it on the surface of other cells to induce an
immune response
lymphocyte that has differentiated, such as a B cell, plasma cell, or cytotoxic T lymphocyte
leukocyte that responds to parasites and is involved in the allergic response
small component of an antigen that is specifically recognized by antibodies, B cells, and T cells; the antigenic
determinant
protease that enters target cells through perforin and induces apoptosis in the target cells; used by NK cells and
killer T cells
