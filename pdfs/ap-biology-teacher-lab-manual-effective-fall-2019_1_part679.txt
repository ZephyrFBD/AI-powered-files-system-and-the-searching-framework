acronutrients are used to synthesize new molecules, 
and, in plants, water is essential for photosynthesis. Organisms have evolved various 
mechanisms for accumulating sufficient quantities of water, ions, and other nutrients and 
for keeping them properly balanced to maintain homeostasis. 
In general, animals possess one or more mechanisms, such as those involved in 
excretion, that let them ingest solutions of nutrients and transport and/or eliminate 
any excess ions or water. However, plants take a different approach; they absorb and 
transport water, nutrients, and ions from the surrounding soil via osmosis, diffusion, and 
active transport. Once water and dissolved nutrients have entered the root xylem, they 
are transported upward to the stems and leaves as part of the process of transpiration 
(the evaporation of water from the plant surface). The amount of water needed daily by 
plants for the growth and maintenance of tissues is small in comparison to the amount 
that is lost
