rs, and the vapor continues to form until the liquid evap-
orates to dryness. Substances with high vapor pressure (such as 
gasoline) evaporate more quickly than substances with low vapor 
pressure (such as motor oil). Liquids that evaporate readily are said 
to be volatile.
Hot water evaporates more quickly than cold water because 
vapor pressure increases with increasing temperature. To see why 
this statement is true, we begin with the fact that the molecules of a 
liquid move at various speeds. Figure 11.24 shows the distribution of 
kinetic energies of the molecules at the surface of a liquid at two tem-
peratures. (The curves are like those shown for gases in Section 10.7.) 
As the temperature is increased, the molecules move more energeti-
cally and more of them can break free from their neighbors and enter 
the gas phase, increasing the vapor pressure.
Figure 11.25 depicts the variation in vapor pressure with tem-
perature for four common substances that differ greatly in volat
