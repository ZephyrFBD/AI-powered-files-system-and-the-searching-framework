se graphite is the more stable (lower-energy) form at 298 K and 
atmospheric pressure. Likewise, the most stable form of hydrogen under standard condi-
tions is H21g2, so this is used as the source of hydrogen in Equation 5.25.
The stoichiometry of formation reactions always indicates that one mole of the 
desired substance is produced, as in Equation 5.25. As a result, standard enthalpies of 
formation are reported in kJ>mol of the substance being formed. Some values are given 
in Table 5.3, and a more extensive table is provided in Appendix C.

Suppose the overall reaction were 
modified to produce 2 H2O(g) rather 
than 2 H2O(l). Would any of the values 
of ∆H in the diagram stay the same?
