29. (II) A shot-putter throws the “shot”
with an
initial speed of 
at a 34.0° angle to the horizontal.
Calculate the horizontal distance traveled by the shot if 
it leaves the athlete’s hand at a height of 2.10 m above 
the ground.
30. (II) A baseball is hit with a speed of 
at an angle of
45.0°. It lands on the flat roof of a 13.0-m-tall nearby build-
ing. If the ball was hit when it was 1.0 m above the ground,
what horizontal distance does it travel before it lands on
the building?
31. (II) A rescue plane wants to drop supplies to isolated moun-
tain climbers on a rocky ridge 235 m below. If the plane is
traveling horizontally with a speed of 
how far in advance of the recipients (horizontal distance)
must the goods be dropped (Fig. 3–38)?
