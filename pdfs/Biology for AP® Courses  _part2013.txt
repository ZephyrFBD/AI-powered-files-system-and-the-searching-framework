cal definition of species, which works for sexually reproducing organisms, is a group of actually or potentially
interbreeding individuals. There are exceptions to this rule. Many species are similar enough that hybrid offspring are
possible and may often occur in nature, but for the majority of species this rule generally holds. In fact, the presence in
nature of hybrids between similar species suggests that they may have descended from a single interbreeding species, and
the speciation process may not yet be complete.
Given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation: the formation of two
species from one original species. Darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the
only illustration found in On the Origin of Species (Figure 18.13a). Compare this illustration to the diagram of elephant
evolution (Figure 18.13b), which shows that as one species changes over time, it branches to form more than one n
