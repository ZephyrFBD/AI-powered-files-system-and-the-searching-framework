 of 
1000 (written log 1000) is 3 because raising 10 to the third power gives 1000.
103 = 1000, therefore, log 1000 = 3
Further examples are
 log 105 = 5
 log 1 = 0 Remember that 100 = 1
 log 10-2 = -2
In these examples the common logarithm can be obtained by inspection. However, it is 
not possible to obtain the logarithm of a number such as 31.25 by inspection. The loga-
rithm of 31.25 is the number x that satisfies the following relationship:
10x = 31.25
Most electronic calculators have a key labeled LOG that can be used to obtain logarithms. 
For example, on many calculators we obtain the value of log 31.25 by entering 31.25 and 
pressing the LOG key. We obtain the following result:
log 31.25 = 1.4949
Notice that 31.25 is greater than 10 11012 and less than 100 11022. The value for log 
31.25 is accordingly between log 10 and log 100, that is, between 1 and 2.
