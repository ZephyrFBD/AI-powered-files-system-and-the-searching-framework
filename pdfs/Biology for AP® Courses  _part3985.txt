s in the Immune System
Immune disruptions may involve insufficient immune responses or inappropriate immune targets. Immunodeficiency
increases an individual's susceptibility to infections and cancers. Hypersensitivities are misdirected responses either to
harmless foreign particles, as in the case of allergies, or to host factors, as in the case of autoimmunity. Reactions to self
components may be the result of molecular mimicry.
