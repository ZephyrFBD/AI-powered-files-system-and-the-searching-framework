in the coding region of the
gene, downstream of a gene, or may be thousands of nucleotides away.
Enhancer regions are binding sequences, or sites, for transcription factors. When a DNA-bending protein binds, the shape
of the DNA changes (Figure 16.10). This shape change allows for the interaction of the activators bound to the enhancers
with the transcription factors bound to the promoter region and the RNA polymerase. Whereas DNA is generally depicted
as a straight line in two dimensions, it is actually a three-dimensional object. Therefore, a nucleotide sequence thousands of
nucleotides away can fold over and interact with a specific promoter.
Turning Genes Off: Transcriptional Repressors
Like prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells also have mechanisms to prevent transcription. Transcriptional repressors can bind
to promoter or enhancer regions and block transcription. Like the transcriptional activators, repressors respond to external
stimuli to prevent the binding of activating transc
