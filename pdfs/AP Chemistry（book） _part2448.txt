st, even though it changes the reac-
tion rate, does not affect the numeric value of K (Figure 15.16). As a result, a catalyst 
increases the rate at which equilibrium is achieved but does not change the composition of the 
equilibrium mixture.

CHAPTER 15 Chemical Equilibrium
The rate at which a reaction approaches equilibrium is an important practical con-
sideration. As an example, let’s again consider the synthesis of ammonia from N2 and H2. 
In designing his process, Haber had to deal with a rapid decrease in the equilibrium con-
stant with increasing temperature, as you can see from Table 15.2. At temperatures suf-
ficiently high to give a satisfactory reaction rate, the amount of ammonia formed was 
too small. The solution to this dilemma was to develop a catalyst that would produce a 
reasonably rapid approach to equilibrium at a sufficiently low temperature, so that the 
equilibrium constant remained reasonably large. The devel
