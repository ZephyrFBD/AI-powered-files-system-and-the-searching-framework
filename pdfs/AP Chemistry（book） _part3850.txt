Both diethyl ether and the cyclic ether tetrahydrofuran, shown below, are common 
solvents for organic reactions. Diethyl ether was formerly used as an anesthetic (known 
simply as “ether” in that context), but it had significant side effects.

Aldehydes and Ketones
Several of the functional groups listed in Table 24.6 contain the carbonyl group, 
C “O. This group, together with the atoms attached to its carbon, defines several 
important functional groups that we consider in this section.
In aldehydes, the carbonyl group has at least one hydrogen atom attached:
Formaldehyde
Acetaldehyde
Methanal

In ketones, the carbonyl group occurs at the interior of a carbon chain and is therefore 
flanked by carbon atoms:
