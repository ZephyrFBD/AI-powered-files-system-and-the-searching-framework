DNA.
(C) is incorrect because only the decondensed DNA experienced
damage. (D) is incorrect because decondensed DNA was the only type
to show DSBs.

A mutation in the operator region would most likely prevent the
repressor from recognizing the operator, thereby stopping it from
binding. With no repressor bound, the genes would be continuously
expressed. Therefore, (D) is correct. (A) is incorrect because only the
operator region would be aﬀected and because this would cause the
genes to be expressed. (B) is incorrect because the genes for lactose
metabolism proteins would be unaﬀected by a mutation to the
operator region. (C) is incorrect because the repressor would not itself
be changed by a mutation to the operator region and because the
mutation is more likely to prevent the binding of the repressor, rather
than cause it to bind too tightly.
