t are homozygous recessives will likely become fewer as the red-head allele is mixed with the
more dominant hair colors.

D
Choice (D) is the answer because it is the only choice that does not predict evolution occurring on the
island, thus supporting a claim for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Choices (A), (B), and (C) all prevent
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and predict evolution. The population is small, mutations are inevitable, and
humans usually do not mate randomly. This population will definitely evolve or undergo genetic drift.
9.
A
Choice (A) is correct because the trait is being selected based on female mating preferences. Longer,
bigger tails indicate reproductive fitness. Peahens choose males who are healthy and strong enough to
grow these big tails and will hopefully produce the best offspring. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect
because they do not describe the female mating preferences.
