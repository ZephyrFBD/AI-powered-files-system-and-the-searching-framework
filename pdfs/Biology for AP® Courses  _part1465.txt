id cross),
can the predicted frequency of recombinant offspring be
60% ? Why or why not?
a.
No. The predicted frequency of recombinant
offspring ranges from 0% (for linked traits) to
50% (for unlinked traits) because of both
parental and nonparental cases.
b.
Yes. The predicted frequency of recombinant
offspring can be 60% if genes are located very
far from each other.
c.
Yes. The predicted frequency can be 60% if
crossing over occurs during every meiotic event.
d.
No. The predicted frequency can never be 60%
due to the presence of mutations such as
deletions.
9. Choose the statement that best describes how
nondisjunction (see Figure 13.6) can result in an
aneuploid zygote.
a.
Nondisjunction only occurs when homologous
chromosomes do not separate during meiosis I,
resulting in the formation of gametes containing
n+1 and n-1 chromosomes.
b.
Nondisjunction only occurs when sister
chromatids do not separate in meiosis II,
resulting in the formation of gametes containing
n+1 and n-1 chromo
