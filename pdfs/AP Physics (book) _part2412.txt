*41. (I) Determine the inductance L of a 0.60-m-long air-filled
solenoid 2.9 cm in diameter containing 8500 loops.
*42. (I) How many turns of wire would be required to make a
130-mH inductor out of a 30.0-cm-long air-filled solenoid
with a diameter of 5.8 cm?
*43. (II) An air-filled cylindrical inductor has 2600 turns, and it is
2.5 cm in diameter and 28.2 cm long. (a) What is its induc-
tance? (b) How many turns would you need to generate the
same inductance if the core were iron-filled instead? Assume
the magnetic permeability of iron is about 1200 times that of
free space.
