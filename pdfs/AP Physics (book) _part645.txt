NOTE Even taking into account the fact that only 60 to 80% of the engine’s
power output reaches the wheels, it is clear from these calculations that an engine
of 75 to 100 kW (100 to 130 hp) is adequate from a practical point of view.

We mentioned in Example 6–14 that only part of the energy output of a car
engine reaches the wheels. Not only is some energy wasted in getting from the
engine to the wheels, in the engine itself most of the input energy (from the burning
of gasoline or other fuel) does not do
