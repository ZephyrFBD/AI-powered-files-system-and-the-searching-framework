ex, we select appropriate functions to 
process these data, and get all the processed indexes between zero and one. 
Through the analytic hierarchy process, we can get the weight vector of all the 
factors in the criteria layer. Dynamic weighted comprehensive model is used to revise 
the indexes of the secondary criterion layer. The first criterion layer can be confirmed 
by weighted calculation and connection model between three main factors. After that, 
we will get the index of the target layer, which must be between zero and one.  
We establish the reasonable assumptions through calculation and analysis. If the 
index of the target or first criterion layer is less than 0.4, which means this country or 
some main factors is unsustainable. Otherwise, we can consider it to be sustainable. 
On behalf of the state, we select Haiti. We search for the original data of each 
factor of the secondary criteria layer about Haiti between 2005 and 2012, through 
which we gain its processed index
