stant to the host’s nonspecific immune system actually elicits
a strong nonspecific immune response from the host.
Which of the following best describes how a resistant parasite
would most likely benefit from stimulating its host’s immune
system in this way?
Stimulation of the host immune system depletes the energy
of the host and makes it more vulnerable to infection.
(A)
Stimulation of the immune system reduces competition by
decreasing the population of other parasites susceptible to
the immune system.
(B)
Stimulation of the immune system is automatic and does not
present an advantage to the parasite.
(C)
Stimulation of the host’s nonspecific defenses at the site of
infection results in a flow of nutrients which supports
parasite growth.
(D)
2. Students built a chamber to study fruit fly behavior. The chamber
consisted of two empty plastic bottles taped together. At one end,
they added a cotton tip coated with a chemical stimulus. They
introduced the fruit flies at the opposite end.
