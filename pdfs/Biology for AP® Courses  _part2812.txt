An important concept in understanding how efficient diffusion is as a means of transport is the surface area to volume ratio.
Recall that any three-dimensional object has a surface area and volume; the ratio of these two quantities is the surface-
to-volume ratio. Consider a cell shaped like a perfect sphere: it has a surface area of 4πr2, and a volume of (4/3)πr3. The
surface-to-volume ratio of a sphere is 3/r; as the cell gets bigger, its surface area to volume ratio decreases, making diffusion
less efficient. The larger the size of the sphere, or animal, the less surface area for diffusion it possesses.
The solution to producing larger organisms is for them to become multicellular. Specialization occurs in complex organisms,
allowing cells to become more efficient at doing fewer tasks. For example, circulatory systems bring nutrients and remove
waste, while respiratory systems provide oxygen for the cells and remove carbon dioxide from them. Other organ systems
