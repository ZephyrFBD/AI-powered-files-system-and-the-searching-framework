e known as prenatal genetic diagnosis (PGD) has been developed. PGD
involves the screening of human embryos as part of the process of in vitro fertilization, during which embryos
are conceived and grown outside the mother's body for some period of time before they are implanted. The
term PGD usually refers to both the diagnosis, selection, and the implantation of the selected embryos.
In the least controversial use of PGD, embryos are tested for the presence of alleles which cause genetic
diseases such as sickle cell disease, muscular dystrophy, and hemophilia, in which a single disease-causing
allele or pair of alleles has been identified. By excluding embryos containing these alleles from implantation
into the mother, the disease is prevented, and the unused embryos are either donated to science or
discarded. There are relatively few in the worldwide medical community that question the ethics of this type
