In Chesapeake Bay, most oysters reach their prime spawning size by
the time they are three years old. An oyster releases millions of eggs
into the water, which join with sperm during the fertilization
process. Fertilized eggs drift away from the spawning grounds in
water currents. Most larvae that hatch from these fertilized eggs die
from predation. Those few offspring that survive long enough to
attach to a suitable substrate and begin growing a hard shell tend to
survive for a relatively long time.
The graph below represents three idealized survivorship curves for
different organisms.
Which line on this graph best fits the life history of the oyster, as
described above, and includes the correct justification for that
answer?
Line A best fits the life history of the oyster because those
individuals that make it to adulthood live a long time.
Line B best fits the life history of the oyster because those
individuals that make it to adulthood
