little nitrogen enters ecosystems directly from the air. Most of it
enters ecosystems by way of bacterial processes.
ENE-1
Energy flows, but matter is recycled.
Nitrogen-fixing bacteria live in the nodules in the roots of
legumes and convert free nitrogen into the ammonium ion
(NH4
+).
Nitrifying bacteria convert the ammonium ion into nitrites and
then into nitrates.
Denitrifying 
bacteria 
convert 
nitrates 
(NO3) 
into 
free
atmospheric nitrogen.
Bacteria of decay decompose organic matter into ammonia.
The main reservoir of nitrogen is the atmosphere, which contains about
79% nitrogen gas (N2). Nitrogen is also found bound in the soil and in
lake, river, and ocean sediments. It is also fixed into animal and plant

HUMANS AND THE BIOSPHERE
Humans threaten to make Earth uninhabitable as the population increases
exponentially and as people waste natural resources, destroy animal
habitats
