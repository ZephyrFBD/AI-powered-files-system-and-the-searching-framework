Thickening of Long Bones
Appositional growth is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bony tissue at the surface of bones.
Osteoblasts at the bone surface secrete bone matrix, and osteoclasts on the inner surface break down bone. The osteoblasts
differentiate into osteocytes. A balance between these two processes allows the bone to thicken without becoming too heavy.
Bone Remodeling and Repair
Bone renewal continues after birth into adulthood. Bone remodeling is the replacement of old bone tissue by new bone
tissue. It involves the processes of bone deposition by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. Normal bone growth
