: Disruptions in the Immune System
Introduction
The environment consists of numerous pathogens, which are agents, usually microorganisms, that cause diseases in their
hosts. A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen. Pathogens include bacteria, protists, fungi
and other infectious organisms. We are constantly exposed to pathogens in food and water, on surfaces, and in the air.
Mammalian immune systems evolved for protection from such pathogens; they are composed of an extremely diverse
array of specialized cells and soluble molecules that coordinate a rapid and flexible defense system capable of providing
protection from a majority of these disease agents.
Vaccines were developed to reduce the chance of infection of a particular disease, such as measles, mumps, polio, or chicken
pox, by assisting the body to develop immunity. However, many diseases still do not have a vaccine, such as the deadly
disease caused by the Ebola virus. Data from the World Health O
