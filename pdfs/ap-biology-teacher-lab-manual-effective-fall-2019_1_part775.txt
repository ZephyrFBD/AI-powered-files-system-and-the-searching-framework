re, energy transfer, entropy 
and enthalpy, abiotic and biotic influences on molecular structure, and the role of 
enzymes in maintaining homeostasis. The laboratory allows students to investigate more 
deeply the relationship between structure and function of enzymes; to develop a concise 
understanding of a specific enzymatic reaction; and then to apply their knowledge and 
newly acquired skills to answer their own question(s) about enzymatic activity. 
â–  Key Vocabulary 
Baseline is a universal term for most chemical reactions. In this investigation, the term 
is used to establish a standard for a reaction. Thus, when manipulating components 
of a reaction (in this case, substrate or enzyme) you have a reference point to help 
understand what occurred in the reaction. The baseline may vary with different 
scenarios pertinent to the design of the experiment, such as altering the environment in 
which the reaction occurs. In this scenario, different conditions can be compared, and 
the
