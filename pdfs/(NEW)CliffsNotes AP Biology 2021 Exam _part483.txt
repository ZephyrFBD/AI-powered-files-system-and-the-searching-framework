 is associated with a decrease in concentrations of K+, Clâˆ’, and
 
sugars. Closing is also influenced by abscisic acid (ABA), a plant hormone.
Transport in Plants
There are two basic types of vascular tissue involved in the transport of materials in plants:
1. Xylem tissue transports water and minerals and also provides mechanical support. The tissue consists mostly of
cells that often have thick cell walls and are usually arranged, end to end, in long columns. Most functioning xylem
cells are dead, that is, they are essentially cell walls, completely lacking cellular components, and contain only the
material being transported. In addition to the primary cell wall that all plant cells have, xylem cells have a secondary
cell wall that gives them additional strength. Openings through one or both cell wall layers allow water to pass
between xylem cells with little or no interference.
2. Phloem tissue transports the products of organic materials such as sugars (products of photosynthesis).
