nism. The most
common ions in a cell are 
and 
There are large differences in the
concentrations of these ions inside and outside an axon, as indicated by the typical
values given in Table 18–2. Other ions are also present, so the fluids both inside
and outside the axon are electrically neutral. Because of the differences in concentra-
tion, there is a tendency for ions to diffuse across the membrane (see Section 13–13
on diffusion). However, in the resting state the cell membrane prevents any net
flow of 
through a mechanism of active transport‡ of 
ions out of the cell
by a particular protein to which 
attach; energy needed comes from ATP.
But it does allow the flow of 
ions, and less so of 
ions, and it is these two
ions that produce the dipole charge layer on the membrane. Because there is 
a greater concentration of 
inside the cell than outside, more 
ions tend 
to diffuse outward across the membrane than diffuse inward. A 
ion that
passes through the membrane becomes attached to
