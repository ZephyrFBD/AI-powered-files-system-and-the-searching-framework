85. (a) A voltmeter and an ammeter can be connected as shown
in Fig. 19–83a to measure a resistance R. If V is the voltmeter
reading, and I is the ammeter reading, the value of R will not
quite be 
(as in Ohm’s law) because some current goes
through the voltmeter. Show that the actual value of R is
where 
is the voltmeter resistance. Note that
