new double helix is composed of one strand from the original piece of DNA and one newly synthesized strand,
DNA replication is described as being semiconservative.
Figure 15.3 DNA Replication Is Semiconservative
To start DNA replication, the enzyme helicase first unwinds the two DNA strands in an area called the origin of
replication, or “ori” site. As part of the double helix is unwound, other sections of the double helix become more
tightly wound, and this results in supercoiling in those areas. Topoisomerase enzymes make temporary nicks in the
sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA to relieve this supercoiling and then reseal these nicks. The enzyme RNA
polymerase then synthesizes an RNA primer using a few complementary RNA nucleotides. New DNA nucleotides
can then be added to this RNA primer. DNA polymerase is the enzyme that adds new nucleotides to the 3′ hydroxyl
group at the end of this RNA primer. DNA polymerase adds new nucleotides in the 5′ to 3′ direction, always
connecting the
