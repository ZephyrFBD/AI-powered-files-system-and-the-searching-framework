-coding/template strand) and adds RNA
nucleotides to generate a single strand of mRNA that will be identical to the other strand of DNA (the
coding/sense strand) except it will have uracil instead of thymine.
mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, and RNAi are all types of RNA that can be created.
mRNA gets processed in eukaryotic cells: introns are removed (spliced out), and a 5’ GTP cap and a 3’
poly(A) tail are added.
Translation occurs in the cytoplasm as mRNA carries the message to the ribosome.
mRNA passes through three sites on the ribosome, the A-site, the P-site, and the E-site.
The mRNA is read in triplets of three nucleotides, called codons. Each tRNA has a region called the
anticodon that is complementary to a codon. Sometimes the pairing is not the normal base-pairing. This is
called wobble pairing.
When a tRNA binds, it brings the corresponding amino acid to add to the growing polypeptide.
Gene expression is regulated primarily by transcription factors influencing transcription (pre-transcrip
