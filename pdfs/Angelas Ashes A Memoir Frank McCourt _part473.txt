 Mam says, Alphie is enough. I’m worn out.That’s the end of it. No 
 
 more children. 
 
 Dad says, The good Catholic woman must perform her wifely 
 
 duties and submit to her husband or face eternal damnation. 
 
 Mam says, As long as there are no more children eternal damnation

 What is Dad to do? There’s a war on. English agents are recruiting 
 
 Irishmen to work in their munitions factories, the pay is good, there are 
 
 no jobs in Ireland, and if the wife turns her back to you there’s no shortage 
 
 of women in England where the able men are off fighting Hitler and 
 
 Mussolini and you can do anything you like as long as you remember 
 
 you’re Irish and lower class and don’t try to rise above your station.
