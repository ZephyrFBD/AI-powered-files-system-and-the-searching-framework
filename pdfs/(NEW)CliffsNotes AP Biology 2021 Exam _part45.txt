freezes, becomes less dense than its liquid form, and, as a result, floats in liquid water. Hydrogen bonds are typically
weak, constantly breaking and reforming, allowing molecules to periodically approach one another. In the solid state
of water, the weak hydrogen bonds between water molecules become rigid and form a crystal that keeps the
molecules separated and less dense than its liquid form. If ice did not float, it would sink and remain frozen due to
the insulating protection of the overlaying water. This would have a profound effect on the survival of organisms
inhabiting the bottom of bodies of water.
4. Water has strong cohesion and high surface tension. Cohesion, or the attraction between like substances, occurs
in water because of the hydrogen bonding between water molecules. The strong cohesion between water molecules
produces a high surface tension, creating a water surface that is firm enough to allow many insects to walk upon it
without sinking.
