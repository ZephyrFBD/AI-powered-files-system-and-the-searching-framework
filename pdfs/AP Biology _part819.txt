matical modeling,
and computer science to analyze biological data. An extremely powerful
bioinformatics tool is BLAST, an acronym for Basic Local Alignment
Search Tool. BLAST is an algorithm that compares biological sequence
information, such as the amino acid sequence in different proteins or the
nucleotide sequence of different DNA sequences. It was designed by
scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1990.
BLAST enables you to input a gene sequence of interest and search
entire genomic libraries for identical or similar sequences in a matter of
seconds. For example, by using BLAST, you might input a particular
mouse gene and find that humans carry a very similar gene. You might
instead discover, as happened a few years ago, that humans and
Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) share some of the same DNA.
If you were to use BLAST to compare five DNA sequences from five
different species, you would see something like the following on your
computer screen:
