it increases the survival of its bearer, selection is said to act for that trait. In contrast, selection
is said to act against unfavorable traits. Favorable traits are adaptive, while unfavorable traits are maladaptive.
Darwin presented his theory for evolution by natural selection using the following arguments:
1. Populations possess an enormous reproductive potential. Darwin calculated that two elephants would produce
a population of 19 million individuals after 750 years if all offspring survived to reproductive maturity and fostered
their normal number of offspring.
2. Population sizes remain stable. Darwin observed that populations generally fluctuate around a constant size.
3. Resources are limited. Resources, such as food, water, or light, do not increase as populations grow larger.
4. Individuals compete for survival. Eventually, the needs of a growing population will exceed the available
resources. As a result, individuals must compete for resources.
5. There is variation amo
