oth major components of human 
breath, H2O1g2 and CO21g2, to produce O21g2 and other products 
(all of which follow the expected patterns of reactivity we have 
seen). Predict the other products in these reactions and design ex-
periments to determine whether KO21s2 does actually react with 
both H2O1g2 and CO21g2.
(c) Propose an experiment to determine whether either of the re-
actions in part (b) is more important in the operation of a firefight-
erâ€™s breathing mask.
(d) The reaction of K(s) and O21g2 leads to a mixture of KO21s2 and 
K2O1s2. Use ideas presented in this exercise to design an exper-
iment to determine the percentages of KO21s2 and K2O1s2 in the 
product mixture that results from the reaction of K(s) with excess 
O21g2.

Table salt is sodium chloride, NaCl, which consists of sodium ions, Na+, 
and chloride ions, Cl-. The structure is held together by ionic bonds, 
which are due to the electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged 
ions. The water consists mainl
