eing sent and being received). This time interval,
is called the
proper time. Then 
in Eqs. 26–1 represents the time interval between the two
events as measured in a reference frame moving with speed v with respect to the
first. In Example 26–1 above,
(and not 
) was set equal to 
because it is only in the rest frame of the muon that the two events (“birth” and
“decay”) occur at the same point in space. The proper time 
is the shortest time
between the events any observer can measure. In any other moving reference
frame, the time 
is greater.
Time dilation at 100 km/h. Let us check time dilation for
everyday speeds. A car traveling 
covers a certain distance in 10.00 s
according to the driver’s watch. What does an observer at rest on Earth measure
for the time interval?
APPROACH The car’s speed relative to Earth, written in meters per second,
is
The driver is at rest in the
reference frame of the car, so we set 
in the time dilation 
formula.
SOLUTION We use Eq. 26–1a:
If you put these
