air-filled parallel-plate capacitor for a circuit
you are building. To make it a reasonable size, suppose you
limit the plate area to 
What would the gap have to
be between the plates? Is this practically achievable?
44. (II) How strong is the electric field between the plates of a
air-gap capacitor if they are 2.0 mm apart and each
has a charge of 
45. (III) A 
capacitor is charged to 746 V and a 
capacitor is charged to 562 V. These capacitors are then dis-
connected from their batteries. Next the positive plates are
connected to each other and the negative plates are connected
to each other. What will be the potential difference across
each and the charge on each? [Hint: Charge is conserved.]
46. (III) A 
capacitor is charged by a 165-V battery 
(Fig. 17–43a) and then is disconnected from the battery.
When this capacitor 
is then connected (Fig. 17–43b) to
a second (initially uncharged)
capacitor,
the final voltage
on each capacitor is 15 V.
What is the value of 
[Hint: Charge is co
