ow. This color change, along with that of 
the indicators bromthymol blue and phenolphthalein, is shown in Figure 16.9. Paper 
tape impregnated with several indicators is widely used for determining approximate 
pH values. 
Give It Some Thought
If the pOH for a solution is 3.00, what is the pH? Is the solution acidic or basic?
A sample of freshly pressed apple juice has a pOH of 10.24. Calculate 3H+4.
Sample Exercise 16.7 
Calculating 3H+ 4 from pOH
SOLUTION
Analyze We need to calculate 3H+4 from pOH.
Plan We will first use Equation 16.20, pH + pOH = 14.00, to 
calculate pH from pOH. Then we will use Equation 16.17 to deter-
mine the concentration of H+.
Solve From Equation 16.20, we have
 
pH = 14.00 -pOH
 
pH = 14.00 -10.24 = 3.76
Next we use Equation 16.17:
pH = -log3H+4 = 3.76
Thus,
log3H+4 = -3.76
To find 3H+4, we need to determine the antilogarithm of -3.76.
