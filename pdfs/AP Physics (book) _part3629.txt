additional Higgs-like particles suggested by theories that go beyond the Standard
Model such as supersymmetry (Section 32–12).

Figure 32–19 shows the “resonance” bump (Section 32–7) that represents the
Higgs boson as detected by the CMS team at the LHC. A second experiment,
ATLAS, came up with the same mass. ATLAS is considered the largest scientific
experiment ever (see Fig. 32–20).
There is no way to know if the Chapter-Opening Photo of a possible Higgs
event, page 915, is actually a Higgs or is a background event. As can be seen in
Fig. 32–19,
