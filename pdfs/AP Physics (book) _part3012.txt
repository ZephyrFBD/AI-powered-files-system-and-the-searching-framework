EXERCISE B A beam contains infrared light of a single wavelength, 1000 nm, and
monochromatic UV at 100 nm, both of the same intensity. Are there more 100-nm photons
or more 1000-nm photons?
Photoelectron speed and energy. What is the kinetic
energy and the speed of an electron ejected from a sodium surface whose work
function is
when illuminated by light of wavelength (a) 410 nm,
(b) 550 nm?
APPROACH We first find the energy of the photons 
If the
energy is greater than 
then electrons will be ejected with varying amounts
of 
with a maximum of
SOLUTION (a) For
The maximum kinetic energy an electron can have is given by Eq. 27–5b,
or
Since 
where
Most ejected electrons will have less 
and less speed than these maximum
values.
(b) For
Since this ph
