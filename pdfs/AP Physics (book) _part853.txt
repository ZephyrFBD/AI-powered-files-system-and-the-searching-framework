of angular momentum. Consider a skater doing a spin on the tips of her skates,
Fig. 8–27. She rotates at a relatively low speed when her arms are outstretched;
when she brings her arms in close to her body, she suddenly spins much faster.
From the definition of moment of inertia,
it is clear that when she
pulls her arms in closer to the axis of rotation, r is reduced for the arms so her
moment of inertia is reduced. Since the angular momentum 
remains constant
(we ignore the small torque due to friction), if I decreases, then the angular
velocity 
must increase. If the skater reduces her moment of inertia by a factor
of 2, she will then rotate with twice the angular velocity.
