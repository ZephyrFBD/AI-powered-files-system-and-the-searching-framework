chanism of
alternative RNA splicing. In this process, different RNA molecules are
produced from the same primary transcript, depending on which RNA
segments are treated as exons and which are treated as introns. (Exons are
expressed sequences. Introns are intervening, noncoding sequences.)
Regulatory proteins specific to a cell type control intron-exon choices by
binding to regulatory sequences within the primary transcript. See Figure
9.7.

Translation of mRNAâ€”Synthesis of a Polypeptide
Translation is the process by which the codons of an mRNA sequence are
changed into an amino acid sequence; see Figure 9.8. Amino acids present
in the cytoplasm are carried by tRNA molecules to the codons of the
mRNA strand at the ribosome according to the base pairing rules (A with
U and C with G). One end of the tRNA molecule bears a specific amino
acid, and the other end bears a nucleotide triplet called an anticodon.
