4. Illustrate what happened during meiosis to produce the results you found. 
5. Do you think the Philadelphia chromosome is a result of crossing over as seen in 
this part of the investigation or some other chromosomal abnormality? Explain your 
answer. 
6. Do you think the cell cycle described for mitosis could be applied to meiosis as well? 
Explain your answer. 
â–  Where Can You Go from Here? 
1. Can the same (or any) environmental factors you tested above affect the amount of 
crossing over that occurs in Sordaria? How would you set up an experiment to test 
this? For example, how does humidity or pH affect the crossover frequency? 
2. Revisit the learning objectives stated earlier. Do you better understand mitosis and 
meiosis? Could you teach this to another class? 
3. How do the mechanisms of cell replication affect genetic diversity and evolution? 
Consider the mechanisms such as crossing over, independent assortment, 
segregation, nondisjunction, and random fe
