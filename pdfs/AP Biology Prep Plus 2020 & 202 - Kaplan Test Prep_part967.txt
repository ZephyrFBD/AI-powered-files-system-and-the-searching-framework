iltration and reabsorption are reversed.

By increasing the permeability of cell membranes, MSM allows the
diﬀusion of oxygen and nutrients. As tissues receive suﬀicient oxygen
and nutrients, blood pressure will decrease, which balances the cell
pressure. The correct answer is (B). (A) is incorrect because MSM
decreases, not increases, blood pressure. (C) is incorrect because MSM
increases permeability, which would enable the diﬀusion of carbon
dioxide and waste from the tissue into the capillary. (D) is incorrect
because MSM does not harden the cell membrane, but makes it more
flexible by increasing its permeability.

The activity of an enzyme is aﬀected by its environment. Factors like
temperature, pH, and concentration play a large role in determining
the rate of a reaction and whether the substrate will even be able to
bind to the enzyme. Diﬀerent enzymes have diﬀerent optimum pH
values, where the active site is best able to match the shape of the
substrate, resulting in
