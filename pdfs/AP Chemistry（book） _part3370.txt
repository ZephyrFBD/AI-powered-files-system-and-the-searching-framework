Reactions Involving 
Neutrons
Most synthetic isotopes used in medicine 
and scientific research are made using 
neutrons as the bombarding particles. 
Because neutrons are neutral, they are not 
repelled by the nucleus. Consequently, 
they do not need to be accelerated to 
cause nuclear reactions. The neutrons 
are produced in nuclear reactors (see Sec-
tion 21.7). For example, cobalt-60, which 
is used in cancer radiation therapy, is 
produced by neutron capture. Iron-58 
is placed in a nuclear reactor and bom-
barded by neutrons to trigger the follow-
ing sequence of reactions:

Transuranium Elements
Nuclear transmutations have been used 
to produce the elements with atomic 
number above 92, collectively known as 
the transuranium elements because 
they follow uranium in the peri
