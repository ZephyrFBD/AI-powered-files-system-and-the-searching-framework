the glomerulus
and run parallel to the distal convoluted tubule.
Both are located in the cortex.

The figure shows the components of a nephron located
within the kidneys. What would likely occur in the
collecting duct if there was increased blood flow to the
glomerulus?
a.
More water would enter the collecting duct.
b.
More urea would enter the collecting duct.
c.
Less NaCl would leave the collecting duct.
d.
Less urea would leave the collecting duct.

The figure below shows the components of a nephron
located within the kidneys. Alcohol impairs the pituitary
gland, which controls how much water is reabsorbed by
the nephrons. The hormone produced by the pituitary
gland, anti-diuretic hormone, increases water reabsorption
by the kidney. How would impairment of this hormone
likely affect the various components of the nephron
pictured below?
a.
Absorption of water from the filtrate would
decrease, indicated by decreased loss of wate
