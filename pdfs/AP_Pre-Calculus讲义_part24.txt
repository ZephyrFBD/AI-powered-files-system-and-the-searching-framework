t you travel every few 
minutes. The distance s you have traveled is a function of the time t: 
s(t) = total distance traveled at time t 
We graph the function s as shown below: 
 
The graph shows that you have traveled a total of 50 miles after 1 hour, 75 miles after 2 
hours, 140 miles after 3 hours, and so on. 
To find your average speed between any two points on the trip, we divide the distance 
traveled by the time elapsed. 
Let’s calculate your average speed between 1:00 P.M. and 4:00 P.M. The time elapsed is 
4 − 1 = 3 hours. To find the distance you traveled, we subtract the distance at 1:00 P.M. 
from the distance at 4:00 P.M., that is, 200 − 50 = 150 mi. 
Thus your average speed is
