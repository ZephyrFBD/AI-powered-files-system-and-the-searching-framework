ty of electron. An electron moves in a
straight line with a constant speed
which has been measured
to a precision of 0.10%. What is the maximum precision with which its position
could be simultaneously measured?
APPROACH The momentum is 
and the uncertainty in p is
The uncertainty principle (Eq. 28–1) gives us the smallest uncer-
tainty in position 
using the equals sign.
SOLUTION The momentum of the electron is
The uncertainty in the momentum is 0.10% of this, or
From the uncertainty principle, the best simultaneous position measurement will
have an uncertainty of
or 110 nm.
NOTE This is about 1000 times the diameter of an atom.
EXERCISE B An electron’s position is measured with a precision of 
Find the minimum uncertainty in its momentum and velocity.
Position uncertainty of a baseball. What is the uncertainty
in position, imposed by the uncertainty principle, on a 150-g baseball thrown at
APPROACH The uncertainty in the speed is 
We multiply 
by m
to get 
and then use the uncertaint
