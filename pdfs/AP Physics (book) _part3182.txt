chromium (Cr) atoms. The Cr atoms are the ones involved in lasing. In a process
called optical pumping, the atoms are excited by strong flashes of light of wave-
length 550 nm, which corresponds to a photon energy of 2.2 eV. As shown in
Fig. 28–19, the atoms are excited from state 
to state 
The atoms quickly
decay either back to 
or to the intermediate state 
which is metastable with a
lifetime of about 
(compared to 
for ordinary levels). With strong
pumping action, more atoms can be found in the 
state than are in the 
state.
Thus we have the inverted population needed for lasing. As soon as a few atoms
in the 
state jump down to 
they emit photons that produce stimulated 
emission of the other atoms, and the lasing action begins. A ruby laser thus emits a
beam whose photons have energy 1.8 eV and a wavelength of 694.3 nm (or
“ruby-red” light).
