r vectors, called the components of the original vector. The
components are usually chosen to be along two perpendicular directions, such as
the x and y axes. The process of finding the components is known as resolving the
vector into its components. An example is shown in Fig. 3–10; the vector 
could
be a displacement vector that points at an angle
north of east, where we
have chosen the positive x axis to be to the east and the positive y axis north.
This vector 
is resolved into its x and y components by drawing dashed lines 
(AB and AC) out from the tip (A) of the vector, making them perpendicular to
the x and y axes. Then the lines 0B and 0C represent the x and y components
of 
respectively, as shown in Fig. 3–10b. These vector components are written 
and 
In this book we usually show vector components as arrows, like vectors,
but dashed. The scalar components,
and 
are the magnitudes of the vector
components, with units, accompanied by a positive or negative sign depending on
