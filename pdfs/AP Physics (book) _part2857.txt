 N is the near point
of the eye, and 
and 
are the focal lengths of objective and
eyepiece, respectively.
Microscopes, telescopes, and other optical instruments are
limited in the formation of sharp images by lens aberrations.
These include spherical aberration, in which rays passing through
the edge of a lens are not focused at the same point as those
that pass near the center; and chromatic aberration, in which
different colors are focused at different points. Compound
lenses, consisting of several elements, can largely correct for
aberrations.
The wave nature of light also limits the sharpness, or
resolution, of images. Because of diffraction, it is not possible
to discern details smaller than the wavelength of the radiation
being used. The useful magnification of a light microscope is
limited by diffraction to about 
[ X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation of very
short wavelength. They are produced when high-speed elec-
trons, accelerated by high voltage in an evacuated t
