ger animals have relatively
higher BMRs per body weight because they
have greater surface area.
c.
BMR increases with body size, because larger
animals require more energy to maintain their
size. However, smaller animals have relatively
higher BMRs per body weight because they
have greater surface area for their mass.

26. Radial symmetry is typically found in aquatic
organisms. What is radial symmetry and why is it
advantageous to certain aquatic organisms?
a.
Radially symmetric means that a plane cut from
the front to back of the organism produces
distinct left and right sides that are mirror
images of each other. It helps certain aquatic
organisms to extract food from surrounding
environments.
