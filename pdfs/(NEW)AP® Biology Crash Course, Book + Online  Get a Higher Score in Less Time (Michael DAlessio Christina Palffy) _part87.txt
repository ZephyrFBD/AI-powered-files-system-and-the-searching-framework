g the data above:
Only 10% of the time will there be recombination between the genes for body type and wings.
4. Genetic Maps
i.
Recombination Frequency allows you to create genetic maps that estimate the distance between
genes.
Example: Assume the following Recombination Frequencies.
Determine the genetic map for genes W,X,Y,Z.
W-Y, 7 map units
W-X, 26 map units
W-Z, 24 map units
Y-X, 19 map units
Y-Z, 31 map units
5. Sex-linked Genes—genes that are carried on the X-chromosome.
i.
Females carry two X chromosomes, XX.
ii. Males carry 1X and 1Y, XY.
iii. Inheritance patterns of sex-linked genes:
A father will always transmit the sex-linked trait to his daughter. His son receives the Y and
does not inherit the trait.
Only females can be carriers of sex-linked traits. Therefore, a carrier female who mates with
a normal male transmits the mutant allele to half of her sons and half of her daughters.
Examples of sex-linked traits include hemophilia and muscular dystrophy.
Barr body—one of th
