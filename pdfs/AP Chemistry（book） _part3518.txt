Solve There are 36 valence-shell electrons (8 from xenon and 7 
from each fluorine). If we make four single Xe¬ F bonds, each 
fluorine has its octet satisfied. Xe then has 12 electrons in its va-
lence shell, so we expect an octahedral arrangement of six electron 
pairs. Two of these are nonbonded pairs. Because nonbonded pairs 
require more volume than bonded pairs 
 (Section 9.2), it is rea-
sonable to expect these nonbonded pairs to be opposite each other. 
The expected structure is square planar, as shown in Figure 22.7.
Comment The experimentally determined structure agrees with 
this prediction.
