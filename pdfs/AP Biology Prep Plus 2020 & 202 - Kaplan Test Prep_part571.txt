In order for DNA polymerases to begin their work, small RNA primers
must first attach to the single strands of DNA aȇer they have been
separated by helicase. (C) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because
mRNA does not bind to DNA at random to form sequences. (B) is
incorrect because tRNA does not bind to DNA, but rather to mRNA at
ribosomes. (D) is incorrect because there is nothing in the description
of the isolation procedure that suggests the researcher is adding
ribonucleotides.

Learning Objective: 13.4
The insertion of an estrogen response element upstream of the
initiation site would make the expression of tubulin become estrogen
responsive, making (A) correct. (B) is incorrect because the baseline
expression of tubulin would remain unchanged; the only eﬀect would
be to make expression estrogen responsive. (C) is incorrect because
the mutation does not occur in the region that encodes for tubulin, but
rather upstream of that region. (D) is incorrect because termina
