therefore changes the ratio of 
dramatically. In order
to pry the rock, the torque due to 
must at least balance the torque due to mg;
that is,
and
With r smaller, the weight mg can be balanced with less force 
The ratio 
is the mechanical advantage of the system. A lever is a “simple machine.” We
discussed another simple machine, the pulley, in Chapter 4, Example 4–14.
EXERCISE B For simplicity, we wrote the equation in Example 9–3 as if the lever were
perpendicular to the forces. Would the equation be valid even for a lever at an angle as
shown in Fig. 9–6?
9–2 Solving Statics Problems
The subject of statics is important because it allows us to calculate certain forces
on (or within) a structure when some of the forces on it are already known. We
will mainly consider situations in which all the forces act in a plane, so we can
have two force equations (x and y components) and one torque equation, for a
total of three equations. Of course, you do not have to use all three equations if
