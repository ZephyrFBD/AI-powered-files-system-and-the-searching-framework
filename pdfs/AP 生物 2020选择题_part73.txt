1.C: Explain biological concepts, 
processes, and/or models in 
applied contexts.
SYI-1.A: Explain how the 
properties of water that 
result from its polarity and 
hydrogen bonding affect its 
biological function.
Structure of 
Water and 
Hydrogen 
Bonding
(A) 
Incorrect. Water does have a high heat capacity; however, this property 
allows the body to rid itself of excess heat, not absorb it.
(B) 
Correct. Water has a high heat of vaporization. Sweat produced by 
the body decreases the temperature of the body by absorbing a large 
quantity of heat energy during the liquid to gas phase change.
(C) 
Incorrect. Water does have a high surface tension; however, this process 
is not responsible for the temperature-reducing properties of sweat.
(D) 
Incorrect. Water does
