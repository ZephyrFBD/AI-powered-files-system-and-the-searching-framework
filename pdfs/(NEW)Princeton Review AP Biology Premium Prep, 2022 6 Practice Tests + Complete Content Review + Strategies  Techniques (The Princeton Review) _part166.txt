h three fatty acid chains attached to it. A fatty acid chain is mostly a long chain of carbons in which
each carbon is covered in hydrogen. One end of the chain has a carboxyl group (just like we saw in an amino acid).
Make the Connection
Amino acids have carboxyl groups and fatty acids have carboxyl groups.
Carboxyl groups are acidic; hence they both have acid in their name.
Let’s take a look.
To make a triglyceride, each of the carboxyl groups (–COOH) of the three fatty acids must react with one of the
three hydroxyl groups (–OH) of the glycerol molecule. This happens by the removal of a water molecule. So, the
creation of a fat requires the removal of three molecules of water. Once again, what have we got? You probably
already guessed it—dehydration synthesis! The linkage now formed between the glycerol molecule and the fatty
acids is called an ester linkage. A fatty acid can be saturated with hydrogens along its long carbon chain or it can
have a few gaps where double bonds exist i
