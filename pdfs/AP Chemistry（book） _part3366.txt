eously. 
A nucleus can also change identity if it is struck by a neutron or by another nucleus. 
Nuclear reactions induced in this way are known as nuclear transmutations.
In 1919, Ernest Rutherford performed the first conversion of one nucleus into 
another, using alpha particles emitted by radium to convert nitrogen-14 into oxygen-17:
 
14
7N + 4
2He ยก 17
8O + 1
1H or 14
7N + a ยก 17
8O + p 
[21.8]
Such reactions have allowed scientists to synthesize hundreds of radioisotopes in the 
laboratory.
A shorthand notation often used to represent nuclear transmutations lists the target 
nucleus, the bombarding particle and the ejected particle in parentheses, followed by 
the product nucleus. Using this condensed notation we see that, Equation 21.8 becomes

sodium, aluminum, and phosphorus?
