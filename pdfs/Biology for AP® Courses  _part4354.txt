, and Sexual Selection in
Drosophila
Research into how animals allocate their energy resources for growth, maintenance, and reproduction has
used a variety of experimental animal models. Some of this work has been done using the common fruit
fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Studies have shown that not only does reproduction have a cost as far as
how long male fruit flies live, but also fruit flies that have already mated several times have limited sperm
remaining for reproduction. Fruit flies maximize their last chances at reproduction by selecting optimal
mates.
In a 1981 study, male fruit flies were placed in enclosures with either virgin or inseminated females. The
males that mated with virgin females had shorter life spans than those in contact with the same number
of inseminated females with which they were unable to mate. This effect occurred regardless of how large
(indicative of their age) the males were. Thus, males that did not mate lived longer, allowing them more
opportunities
