trophs (which need the carbon) and the heterotrophs (which need the oxygen). Gas
exchange through the atmosphere and water is one way that the carbon cycle connects all living organisms on Earth.
The Biogeochemical Carbon Cycle
The movement of carbon through the land, water, and air is complex, and in many cases, it occurs much more slowly
geologically than as seen between living organisms. Carbon is stored for long periods in what are known as carbon
reservoirs, which include the atmosphere, bodies of liquid water (mostly oceans), ocean sediment, soil, land sediments
(including fossil fuels), and the Earthâ€™s interior.
As stated, the atmosphere is a major reservoir of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and is essential to the process of
photosynthesis. The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon in the oceans.
The exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and water reservoirs influences how much carbon is found in each location,
and
