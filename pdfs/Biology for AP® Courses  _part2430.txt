n, and only anaerobic organisms were able to live. Cyanobacteria evolved from early
phototrophs and began the oxygenation of the atmosphere. The increase in oxygen concentration allows the evolution of
other life forms with other metabolic processes. Most prokaryotes prefer to live in communities, often forming biofilms.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 of the AP速
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP速 exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
