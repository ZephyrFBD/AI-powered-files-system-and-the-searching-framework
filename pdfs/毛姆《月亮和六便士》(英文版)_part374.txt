n old Frenchman of great stature and exceeding bulk. His body was shaped like 
a huge duck's egg; and his eyes, sharp, blue, and good-natured, rested now and then with self-
satisfaction on his enormous paunch. His complexion was florid and his hair white. He was a man 
to attract immediate sympathy. He received us in a room that might have been in a house in a 
provincial town in France, and the one or two Polynesian curios had an odd look. He took my hand 
in both of his -- they were huge -- and gave me a hearty look, in which, however, was great 
shrewdness. When he shook hands with Capitaine Brunot he enquired politely after Madame et les 
enfants. For some minutes there was an exchange of courtesies and some local gossip about the 
island, the prospects of copra and the vanilla crop; then we came to the object of my visit.
I shall not tell what Dr. Coutras related to me in his words, but in my own, for I cannot hope to 
give at second hand any impression of his vivacious delivery.
