 like falling dominoes. The advantage of this
complex set of reactions is that the multistep pathway provides more
opportunities to amplify the signal greatly. Signal transduction pathways
exist in both yeast and animal cells, and in bacteria and plants. The
striking similarity in these pathways among diverse organisms
suggests that the pathways evolved hundreds of millions of years ago
in a common ancestor.
One representative example of a signal transduction pathway is the one
that demonstrates how the hormone epinephrine causes a liver cell to
release glucose into the bloodstream. Epinephrine binds to a receptor that
activates the G protein, followed by the production of an intermediate
molecule, cAMP, the second messenger, which distributes and amplifies
the signal throughout the cell. See Figure 3.25 on page 52.
