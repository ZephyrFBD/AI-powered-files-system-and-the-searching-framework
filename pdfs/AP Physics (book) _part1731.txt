eparate further. If a positive charge is brought close instead, the 
electrons are induced to flow upward, so the leaves are less negative and their
separation is reduced, Fig. 16–12c.
The electroscope was used in the early studies of electricity. The same 
principle, aided by some electronics, is used in much more sensitive modern
electrometers.
†Coulomb reasoned that if a charged conducting sphere is placed in contact with an identical uncharged
sphere, the charge on the first would be shared equally by the two of them because of symmetry. He
thus had a way to produce charges equal to 
and so on, of the original charge.
‡The validity of Coulomb’s law today rests on precision measurements that are much more sophisticated
than Coulomb’s original experiment. The exponent 2 on r in Coulomb’s law has been shown to be
accurate to 1 part in 
[that is,
].

We have seen that an electric charge exerts a force of attraction or repulsion on
