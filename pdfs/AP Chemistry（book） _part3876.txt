Proteins are not active biologically unless they are in a particular shape in solution. 
The process by which the protein adopts its biologically active shape is called folding. 
The shape of a protein in its folded form—determined by all the bends, kinks, and sec-
tions of rodlike a@helical, b@sheet, or flexible coil components—is called the tertiary 
structure.
Globular proteins fold into a compact, roughly spherical shape. Globular proteins 
are generally soluble in water and are mobile within cells. They have nonstructural 
functions, such as combating the invasion of foreign objects, transporting and storing 
oxygen (hemoglobin and myoglobin), and acting as catalysts. The fibrous proteins form 
a second class of proteins. In these substances, the long coils align more or less in par-
allel to form long, water-insoluble fibers. Fibrous proteins provide structural integrity 
and strength to
