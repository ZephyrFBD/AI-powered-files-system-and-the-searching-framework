ually enclosing it. Once the vesicle containing the particle
is enclosed within the cell, the clathrin disengages from the membrane and the vesicle merges with a lysosome for the
breakdown of the material in the newly formed compartment (endosome). When accessible nutrients from the degradation
of the vesicular contents have been extracted, the newly formed endosome merges with the plasma membrane and releases
its contents into the extracellular fluid. The endosomal membrane again becomes part of the plasma membrane.
Activity
Create a representation/diagram to describe how a neutrophil, a type of human white blood cell, attacks and
destroys an invading bacterium. What cellular organelles are involved in this process?
Pinocytosis
A variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis. This literally means “cell drinking” and was named at a time when the
assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this is a process that takes in molecules,
including
