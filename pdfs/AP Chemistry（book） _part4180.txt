. page 353 No. Although the 
bond dipoles are in opposite directions, they will not have the same 
magnitude because the C ¬S bond is not as polar as the C ¬ O bond. 
Thus, the sum of the two vectors will not equal zero and the mol-
ecule is polar. page 357 They are both oriented perpendicular to 
the F ¬ Be ¬ F axis. page 358 None. All of the 2p orbitals are used 
in constructing the sp3 hybrid orbitals. page 364 There are three 
electron domains about each N atom, so we expect sp2 hybridization 
at each of the N atoms. The H ¬ N ¬ N angles should therefore be 
roughly 120°, and the molecule is not expected to be linear. In order 
for the p bond to form, all four atoms would have to be in the same 
plane. page 368 sp hybridization. page 371 The excited mole-
cule would fall apart. It would have an electron configuration s1s

and therefore a bond order of 0. page 372 Yes, it will have a bond 
order of 1
