uclear shuttling (by influencing modifications to the
nuclear pore complex), can alter RNA stability (by binding or not binding to the RNA to regulate its stability), can
modify translation (increase or decrease), or can change post-translational modifications (add or remove phosphates or other
chemical modifications).

The addition of an ubiquitin group to a protein marks that protein for degradation. Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating
that the protein lifespan is complete. These proteins are moved to the proteasome, an organelle that functions to remove
proteins, to be degraded (Figure 16.15). One way to control gene expression, therefore, is to alter the longevity of the
protein.
Figure 16.15 Proteins with ubiquitin tags are marked for degradation within the proteasome.
