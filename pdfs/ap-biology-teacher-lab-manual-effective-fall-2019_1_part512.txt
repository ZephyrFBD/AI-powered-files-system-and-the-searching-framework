e. Although this seems 
counterintuitive because you want students to follow their curiosity, having certain 
materials available will cut down on time and costs. 
■ Timing and Length of Lab 
Consider this investigation to be a learning module, not a typical teacher-directed 
“cookbook lab.” The investigation provides students myriad opportunities to develop 
biotech laboratory skills; as they work through the background information and answer 
questions, they are exploring concepts more deeply. 
Day 1 
Allow approximately one class period (45–60 minutes) to preview the lab and let 
students work through the background information and prelab questions interspersed 
in the Getting Started section of the investigation. Alternatively, you can assign this 
material for homework. 
Day 2 
Allow one class period (45–60 minutes) for students to transform cells and spread plates. 
Day 3 
It may take longer than 24 hours for students to be able to observe transformed cells. You 
will have to mon
