with drug-resistant Plasmodium. DNA sequences 
of four different Plasmodium genes thought to be 
involved in resistance were compared between 
samples from patients with drug-sensitive 
Plasmodium 
 and patients with drug-resistant 
Plasmodium.  
Which of the following best supports the 
 
hypothesis that preexisting mutations confer  
drug resistance? 
(A) Drug resistance can sometimes be reversed 
by simultaneous treatment with a drug that 
inhibits the drug-pumping mechanism of 
 
Plasmodium. 
(B) Some of the mutations that occur most 
frequently in samples from patients treated 
with antimalarial drugs are detectable in 
Plasmodium samples collected prior to use 
of antimalarial drugs. 
(C) Continued use of the same antimalarial drugs 
leads to increased Plasmodium resistance. 
(D) The same mechanism of drug resistance  
in Plasmodia isolated 
 from separate 
 
populations of patients resulted from an 
accumulation of new genetic mutations.
