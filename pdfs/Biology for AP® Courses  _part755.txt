 state of high entropy after
the earthquake and energy must be spent to bring
the system to low entropy.
b.
The ant farm is in the state of lower entropy after
the earthquake and energy must be spent to bring
the system to high entropy.
c.
The ant farm is in the state of higher entropy
before the earthquake and energy is given out of
the system after the earthquake.
d.
The ant farm is in the state of lower entropy
before the earthquake and energy is given out of
the system after the earthquake.
37. Energy transfers take place constantly in every day
activities. Think of two scenarios: cooking on a stove and
driving. Explain how the second law of thermodynamics
applies to these scenarios.
a.
Heat is lost into the room while cooking and into
the metal of the engine during gasoline
combustion.
b.
Heat gained while cooking helps to make the
food and heat released due to gasoline
combustion helps the car accelerate.
c.
The energy given to the system remains constant
during cooking and more
