directions of a reversible reaction.
Reactions that are catalyzed by only one enzyme can go to equilibrium, stalling the reaction. In contrast, if two different
enzymes (each specific for a given direction) are necessary for a reversible reaction, the opportunity to control the rate of
the reaction increases, and equilibrium is not reached.
A number of enzymes involved in each of the pathways—in particular, the enzyme catalyzing the first committed reaction
of the pathway—are controlled by attachment of a molecule to an allosteric site on the protein. The molecules most
commonly used in this capacity are the nucleotides ATP, ADP, AMP, NAD+, and NADH. These regulators, allosteric
effectors, may increase or decrease enzyme activity, depending on the prevailing conditions. The allosteric effector alters
the steric structure of the enzyme, usually affecting the configuration of the active site. This alteration of the protein’s (the
enzyme’s) structure either increases or decreases its affi
