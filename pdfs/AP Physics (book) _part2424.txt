1â€“9 states that an overloaded motor
may burn out due to high currents. Suppose you have a
blender with an internal resistance of 
(a) At 120 V,
what is the initial current through the blender? (b) The
blender is rated at 2.0 A for continuous use. What is the back
emf of the blender? (c) At what rate is heat dissipated in the
blender during normal use? (d) If the blender jams and stops
turning, at what rate is heat dissipated in the motor coils?
79. Power is generated at 24 kV at a generating plant located
56 km from a town that requires 55 MW of power at 
12 kV. Two transmission lines from the plant to the town
each have a resistance of 
What should the
output voltage of the transformer at the generating plant be
for an overall transmission efficiency of 98.5%, assuming
a perfect transformer?
80. The primary windings of a transformer which has an 88%
efficiency are connected to 110-V ac. The secondary 
windings are connected across a
75-W lightbulb.
(a) Calculate the current through th
