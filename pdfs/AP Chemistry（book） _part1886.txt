 and are thus freed to move through the lattice, giving 
rise to electrical and thermal conductivity.
Without the overlap of energy bands, the periodic properties of metals could not 
be explained. In the absence of the d- and p-bands, we would expect the s-band to be 
half-filled for the alkali metals (group 1A) and completely filled for the alkaline-earth 
metals (group 2A). If that were true, metals like magnesium, calcium, and strontium 
would not be good electrical and thermal conductors, in disagreement with experimen-
tal observations.
While the conductivity of metals can be qualitatively understood using either the 
electron-sea model or the molecular orbital model, many physical properties of transi-
tion metals, such as the melting points plotted in Figure 12.21, can be explained only 
with the latter model. The molecular orbital model predicts that bonding first becomes 
stronger as the number of valence electrons increases and the bonding orbitals are 
increasingly populate
