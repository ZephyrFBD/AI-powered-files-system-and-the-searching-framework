h muscle contractions,
the muscles of the esophagus push the food towards the stomach. In order to speed up the actions of enzymes in the stomach,
the stomach is an extremely acidic environment, with a pH between 1.5 and 2.5. The gastric juices, which include enzymes
in the stomach, act on the food particles and continue the process of digestion. Further breakdown of food takes place in the
small intestine where enzymes produced by the liver, the small intestine, and the pancreas continue the process of digestion.
The nutrients are absorbed into the blood stream across the epithelial cells lining the walls of the small intestines. The waste
material travels on to the large intestine where water is absorbed and the drier waste material is compacted into feces; it is
stored until it is excreted through the rectum.
