results. In a weakened state, an animal can easily succumb to
disease. During the dry season, forest fires become more prevalent.
They can destroy what little food is available. Both density-
dependent and density-independent factors play a role in regulating

correct about these factors?

because they harm the environment and kill many animals.
Disease is a density-independent factor because its cause has
