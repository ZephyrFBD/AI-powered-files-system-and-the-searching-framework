h, we typically do not have experiments involving radioactive 
substances in general chemistry laboratories. We can nevertheless 
ponder the design of some hypothetical experiments that would 
allow us to explore some of the properties of radium, which was 
discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898.
(a) A key aspect of the discovery of radium was Marie Curieâ€™s obser-
vation that pitchblende, a natural ore of uranium, had greater 
radioactivity than pure uranium metal. Design an  
experiment 
to reproduce this observation and to obtain a ratio of the activ-
ity of pitchblende relative to that of pure uranium.
(b) Radium was first isolated as halide salts. Suppose you had pure 
samples of radium metal and radium bromide. The sample sizes 
are on the order of milligrams and are not amenable to the usual 
forms of elemental analysis. Could you use a device that mea-
sures radioactivity quantitatively to determine the empirical 
formula of radium bromide? What information must you use
