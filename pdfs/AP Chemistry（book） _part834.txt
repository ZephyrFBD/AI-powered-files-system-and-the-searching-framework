sphere does 382 J of work on the balloon. (b) A 100.0-g bar 
of gold is heated from 25 °C to 50 °C during which it absorbs 
322 J of heat. Assume the volume of the gold bar remains 
constant.
 5.27 A gas is confined to a cylinder fitted with a piston and an 
electrical heater, as shown here:
 
 Suppose that current is supplied to the heater so that 100 J of 
energy is added. Consider two different situations. In case (1) 
the piston is allowed to move as the energy is added. In case

 5.36 Suppose that the gas-phase reaction 2 NO1g2 +  O21g2 ¡ 
2 NO21g2 were carried out in a constant-volume container 
at constant temperature. (a) Would the measured heat 
change represent ∆H or ∆E? (b) If there is a difference, which 
quantity is larger for this reaction? (c) Explain your answer to 
part (b).
 5.37 A gas is confined to a cylinder under constant atmospheric 
pressure, as illustrated in Figure 5.4. When the gas undergoes 
a particular chemical reaction, i
