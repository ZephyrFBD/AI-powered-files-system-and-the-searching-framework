4.11 The student is able to justify the selection of the kind of data needed to answer
scientific questions about the interactions of populations within communities.
The logistic model of population growth, while valid in many natural populations and a useful model, is a simplification
of real-world population dynamics. Implicit in the model is that the carrying capacity of the environment does not change,
which is not the case. The carrying capacity varies annually: for example, some summers are hot and dry whereas others
are cold and wet. In many areas, the carrying capacity during the winter is much lower than it is during the summer.
Also, natural events such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and fires can alter an environment and hence its carrying capacity.
Additionally, populations do not usually exist in isolation. They engage in interspecific competition: that is, they share
the environment with other species, competing with them for the same resources. These factor
