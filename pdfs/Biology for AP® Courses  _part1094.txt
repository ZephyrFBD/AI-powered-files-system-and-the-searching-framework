c.
Autocrine signaling helps to amplify the signal
by inducing more signaling production from the
cell itself.
d.
Autocrine signaling is specific only for the cell
that produced it.

fail to respond to the thyroid hormone?
a.
The MAPK cascade leading to cell activation is
defective in the target cells.
b.
The DNA sequence it binds to underwent a
mutation.
c.
There is no intracellular receptor for thyroid
hormone in the cell.
d.
The second messenger does not recognize the
signal from the receptor.
