m HF to HI, even though the bond 
length is increasing. Calculations identical to those used in Sample Exercise 8.5 show 
that the charges on the atoms decrease from 0.41+ and 0.41- in HF to 0.057+ and 
0.057- in HI. We can visualize the varying degree of electronic charge shift in these 
substances from computer-generated renderings based on calculations of electron 
distribution, as shown in Figure 8.11. For these molecules, the change in the electro-
negativity difference has a greater effect on the dipole moment than does the change 
in bond length.

Give It Some Thought
The bond between carbon and hydrogen is one of the most important types 
of bonds in chemistry. The length of an H ¬ C bond is approximately 1.1 Å. 
Based on this distance
