recessive sex-linked
condition. In order to be affected, she must inherit a mutant gene
from both parents.
CROSSOVER AND LINKAGE MAPPING
The farther apart two genes are on one chromosome, the more likely they
will be separated from each other during meiosis because a crossover
event will occur between them. At the site at which a crossover and
recombination occur, one can see a chiasma, a physical bridge built
around the point of exchange. The result of a cross-over is a
recombination. Crossover and recombination are major sources of
variation in sexually reproducing organisms.
SYI-3
The probability that genes on the same chromosome will segregate as a unit is a
function of the distance between the genes.
Figure 8.6 shows one crossover between homologous chromosomes.
Without the crossover, the resulting four gametes would contain the
following genes: AB, AB, ab, and ab. There would be only two different
types of gametes, AB and ab. With one crossover (as shown), the four
resulting game
