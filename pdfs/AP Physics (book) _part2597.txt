Problem 15.
18. Light rays from stars (including our Sun) always bend toward
the vertical direction as they pass through the Earth’s
atmosphere. (a) Why does this make sense? (b) What can
you conclude about the apparent positions of stars as viewed

sharp image of an object far away? Explain.
20. A photographer moves closer to his subject and then refocuses.
Does the camera lens move farther away from or closer to

21. Can a diverging lens form a real image under any circum-
stances? Explain.
22. Light rays are said to be “reversible.” Is this consistent with
the thin lens equation? Explain.
23. Can real
