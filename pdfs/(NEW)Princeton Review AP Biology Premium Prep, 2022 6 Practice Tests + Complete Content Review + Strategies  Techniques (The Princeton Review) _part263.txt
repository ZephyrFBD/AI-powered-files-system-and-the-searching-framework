Homeostasis
All living things have a “steady state” that they try to maintain. This is helpful because the structures and processes
within living things are sensitive to things like temperature, pH, pressure, salinity, osmotic pressure, and many other
things. The set of conditions under which living things can successfully survive is called homeostasis. The body is
constantly working to maintain this state by taking measurements and then responding appropriately. That might
mean shivering if it is cold or releasing the hormone insulin if blood glucose is high. Depending on the condition,
the body will respond accordingly.
Your blood glucose levels are regulated by insulin and glucagon, two
hormones released from your pancreas. For example, when you’ve just eaten,
blood sugar levels are high, and this stimulates insulin release. The cells of
your body take up glucose and hepatocytes in your liver store extra glucose,
as glycogen. Blood sugar levels go down,
