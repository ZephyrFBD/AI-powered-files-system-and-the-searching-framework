 significant shadow region.
This rule applies to reflection from an obstacle as well. Very little of a wave is
reflected unless the wavelength is smaller than the size of the obstacle.
A rough guide to the amount of diffraction is
where is roughly the angular spread of waves after they have passed through an
opening of width or around an obstacle of width 
That waves can bend around obstacles, and thus can carry energy to areas
behind obstacles, is very different from energy carried by material particles.
A clear example is the following: if you are standing around a corner on one side
of a building, you cannot be hit by a baseball thrown from the other side, but you
can hear a shout or other sound because the sound waves diffract around the
edges of the building.
