C. Increased Rate of Species Extinction—habitat destruction, overexploitation, and introduction of exotic
species and diseases are the greatest threats to biodiversity and are currently contributing to an increase in
the rate of species extinction.
1. Biodiversity—the degree of variation of species in a given area; the area can encompass a community
or the entire biosphere.
2. Increasing extinction rates are currently decreasing biodiversity.
3. The major causes of decreasing biodiversity are overexploitation, introduction of exotic species and
diseases, and habitat destruction.
4. Reasons for preservation of biodiversity include utilitarian and nonutilitarian consideration.
5. Conservation biology focuses on maintaining biodiversity and includes st
