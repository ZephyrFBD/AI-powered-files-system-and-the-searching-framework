tion of EGFR has been successful. Propose a model to explain how the 
antibody therapy most likely interferes with the cell signaling pathway, and give ONE reason the 
therapy is effective for treating cancer. 
Proposed model (1 point) 
Antibody competes with/prevents ligand binding to EGFR 
Receptor activation is inhibited. 
Reasoning (1 point)
Inhibits cell cycle progression 
Blocks cell division

Thirty corn seedlings of equal size were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. At the 
beginning of the experiment, the plants in group I were dried and the mass was de
