mogeneous molecules (like 
and 
), one can
estimate the bond length of heterogeneous molecules (like
CO, CN, and NO). This is done by summing half of each
bond length of the homogenous molecules to estimate that
of the heterogeneous molecule. Given the following bond
lengths:
estimate the bond lengths for: HN, CN,
and NO.
4. (II) Binding energies are often measured experimentally in
kcal per mole, and then the binding energy in eV per mole-
cule is calculated from that result. What is the conversion
factor in going from kcal per mole to eV per molecule? What
is the binding energy of 
in kcal per mole?
5. (III) Estimate the binding energy of the 
molecule,
assuming the two H nuclei are 0.074 nm apart and the two
electrons spend 33% of their time midway between them.
6. (III) (a) Apply reasoning similar to that in the text for the
and 
states in the formation of the 
mole-
cule to show why the molecule 
is not formed. (b) Explain
why the 
molecular ion could form. (Experiment
shows it ha
