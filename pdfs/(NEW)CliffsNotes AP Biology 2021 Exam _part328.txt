ino acid methionine is also the codon that signals the beginning of translation.
Note: You do not need to memorize the genetic code (Figure 9-4) for the AP exam.
2. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a short RNA molecule (consisting of about 80 nucleotides) that is used for transporting
amino acids to their proper place on the mRNA. Interactions among various parts of the tRNA molecule result in
base-pairings between nucleotides, folding the tRNA in such a way that it forms a three-dimensional molecule. (In
two dimensions, a tRNA resembles the three leaflets of a clover leaf; in three dimensions, it resembles an upside-
down L.) One end of the tRNA attaches to an amino acid. Another portion of the tRNA, specified by a triplet
combination of nucleotides, is the anticodon. During translation, the anticodon of the tRNA base-pairs with the
codon of the mRNA. Exact base-pairing between the third nucleotide of the tRNA anticodon and the third
nucleotide of the mRNA codon is often not required. This rela
