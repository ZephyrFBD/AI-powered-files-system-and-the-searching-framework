ycles in
multicellular organisms and give an example of an
organism that employs each.
a.
In a diploid dominant cycle, the multicellular
diploid stage is present, as in humans. Haploid
dominant life cycles have a multicellular haploid
stage, as in fungi. In alternation of generations,
both haploid dominant and diploid dominant
stages alternate, as in plants.
b.
In a diploid dominant cycle, the unicellular
diploid stage is present, as in humans. In a
haploid dominant life cycle, a unicellular
haploid stage is present, as in fungi. In
alternation of generations both haploid dominant
and diploid dominant stages alternate, as in
plants.
c.
In a diploid dominant cycle, a multicellular
haploid stage is present, as in humans. In a
haploid dominant life cycle, a multicellular
diploid stage is present, as in fungi. In
alternation of generations, both haploid
dominant and diploid dominant stages alternate,
as in plants.
d.
In a diploid dominant cycle, a multicellular
diploid stage is present, as
