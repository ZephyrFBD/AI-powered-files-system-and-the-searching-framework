hromosome
should differ in size, as they do in most organisms. Assume that your dividing cell contains 3
chromosomes: numbered chromosome 1, 2, and 3.
2.
Using both members of each homologous pair for chromosomes 1–3, model how the
chromosomes would appear in a cell that had just finished the S phase of the cell cycle. Once
your teacher has approved your model, have one member of your group document the model by
photographing or drawing it.
3.
Now, repeat step 2 but show the cell at metaphase during mitosis.
4.
Finally, model the two daughter cells that will result from mitosis. Again, have one member of your
group document the model.
5.
Repeat steps 2–5 for both meiosis I and meiosis II. Remember that you should have four daughter
cells at the end of meiosis II. Also remember to ask your teacher for approval and document your
model before moving on to the next phase of meiosis.
6.
Exchange/ copy all of the drawings or photographs that your group took of your models. As a
group or indi
