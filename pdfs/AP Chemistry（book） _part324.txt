Names and Formulas of Ionic Compounds
Recall from Section 2.7 that ionic compounds usually consist of metal ions combined 
with nonmetal ions. The metals form the cations, and the nonmetals form the anions.
1. Cations
a. Cations formed from metal atoms have the same name as the metal:
Na+
sodium ion
Zn2+
zinc ion
Al3+
aluminum ion
b.  
If a metal can form cations with different charges, the positive charge is indicated by a 
Roman numeral in parentheses following the name of the metal:
Fe2+
iron(II) ion
Cu+
copper(I) ion
Fe3+
iron(III) ion
Cu2+
copper(II) ion
Ions of the same element that have different charges have different chemical and 
physical properties, such as color (Figure 2.22).
Most metals that form cations with different charges are transition metals, 
elements that occur in the middle of the periodic table, from group 3B to group 
2B (as indicated on the periodic table on the front inside cover of this book). T
