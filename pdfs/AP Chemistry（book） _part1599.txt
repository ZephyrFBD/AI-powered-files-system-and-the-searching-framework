s affected when some O2 is introduced 
into a container if the temperature and volume remain constant? How is the total 
pressure affected?
SOLUTION
Analyze We need to calculate the pressure for two gases in the same 
volume and at the same temperature.
Plan Because each gas behaves independently, we can use the 
ideal-gas equation to calculate the pressure each would exert if 
the other were not present. Per Dalton’s law, the total pressure is 
the sum of these two partial pressures.
Solve We first convert the mass of each gas to moles:
 
nO2 = 16.00 g O22a 1 mol O2
32.0 g O2
b = 0.188 mol O2
 
nCH4 = 19.00 g CH42a 1 mol CH4
16.0 g CH4
b = 0.563 mol CH4
We use the ideal-gas equation to calculate the partial pressure of 
each gas:
