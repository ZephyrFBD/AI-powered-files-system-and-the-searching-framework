duced.
(C) 
Incorrect. Over the 60-minute experiment, the absorbance of tube 3 did 
not change, indicating that DCPIP was not reduced.
(D) 
Incorrect. Over the 60-minute experiment, the absorbance of tube 4 did 
not change, indicating that DCPIP was not reduced.

Skill
Learning Objective
Topic
6.B: Support a claim with 
evidence from biological 
principles, concepts, processes, 
and/or data.
ENE-1.J: Explain how cells 
capture energy from light 
and transfer it to biological 
molecules for storage and 
use.
Photosynthesis
(A) 
Correct. Tube 2 showed a reduction in absorbance while tube 3 did not, 
which suggests that light was required for the reaction.
(B) 
Incorrect. This experiment does not address the source of the electrons 
in the electron transport chain.
(C) 
Incorrect. This experiment does not address the source of carbon used 
by plants for producing carbohydrates.
(D) 
Incorrect. DCPIP is an electron acceptor, not an electron donor.
