asses is less than the mass of the uranium. The difference in mass,
or energy, between the original uranium nucleus and the fission fragments is about
per nucleon. Because there are 236 nucleons involved in
each fission, the total energy released per fission is
(31;5)
This is an enormous amount of energy for one single nuclear event. At a practical
level, the energy from one fission is tiny. But if many such fissions could occur 
in a short time, an enormous amount of energy at the macroscopic level would 
be available. A number of physicists, including Fermi, recognized that the 
neutrons released in each fission (Eqs. 31–3 and 31–4) could be used to create a
chain reaction. That is, one neutron initially causes one fission of a uranium
nucleus; the two or three neutrons released can go on to cause additional fissions,
so the process multiplies as shown schematically in Fig. 31–5.
If a self-sustaining chain reaction was actually possible in practice, the
enormous energy available in f
