 the torques balance. When the needle is in equilibrium
at rest, the torques have equal magnitude:
so
The deflection of the pointer,
is directly proportional to the current I flowing
in the coil, but also depends on the angle 
the coil makes with 
For a useful
meter we need 
to depend only on the current I, independent of 
To solve this
problem, magnets with curved pole pieces are used and the galvanometer coil is
wrapped around a cylindrical iron core as shown in Fig. 20â€“36. The iron tends to
concentrate the magnetic field lines so that 
always points parallel to the face of
the coil at the wire outside the core. The force is then always perpendicular to the
face of the coil, and the torque will not vary with angle. Thus 
will be propor-
tional to I, as required for a useful meter.
