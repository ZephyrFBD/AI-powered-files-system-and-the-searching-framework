CHAPTER 8
Rotational Motion
63. (II) A nonrotating cylindrical disk of moment of inertia I
is dropped onto an identical disk rotating at angular 
speed 
Assuming no external torques, what is the final
common angular speed of the two disks?
64. (II) A diver (such as the one shown in Fig. 8â€“28) can reduce
her moment of inertia by a factor of about 3.5 when changing
from the straight position to the tuck position. If she makes
2.0 rotations in 1.5 s when in the tuck position, what is her
angular speed (rev s) when in the straight position?
65. (II) A figure skater can increase her spin rotation rate
from an initial rate of 1.0 rev every 1.5 s to a final rate of
If her initial moment of inertia was 
what is her final moment of inertia? How does she physi-
cally accomplish this change?
66. (II) (a) What is the angular momentum of a figure skater
spinning at 
with arms in close to her body,
assuming her to be a uniform cylinder with a height of
1.5 m, a
