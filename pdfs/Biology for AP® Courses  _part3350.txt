nin is most important in children (when it stimulates bone growth), during pregnancy (when it reduces
maternal bone loss), and during prolonged starvation (because it reduces bone mass loss). In healthy nonpregnant, unstarved
adults, the role of calcitonin is unclear.
Hormonal Regulation of Growth
Hormonal regulation is required for the growth and replication of most cells in the body. Growth hormone (GH), produced
by the anterior portion of the pituitary gland, accelerates the rate of protein synthesis, particularly in skeletal muscle and
bones. Growth hormone has direct and indirect mechanisms of action. The first direct action of GH is stimulation of
triglyceride breakdown (lipolysis) and release into the blood by adipocytes. This results in a switch by most tissues from
utilizing glucose as an energy source to utilizing fatty acids. This process is called a glucose-sparing effect. In another
direct mechanism, GH stimulates glycogen breakdown in the liver; the glycogen is then relea
