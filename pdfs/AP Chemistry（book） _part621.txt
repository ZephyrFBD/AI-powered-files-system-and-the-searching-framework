▲ Figure 4.18 Procedure for titrating an acid against a standard solution of NaOH. The acid–base  
indicator, phenolphthalein, is colorless in acidic solution but takes on a pink color in basic solution.
Go Figure
How would the volume of standard solution added change if that solution 
were Ba(OH)2(aq) instead of NaOH(aq)?
*More precisely, the color change of an 
indicator signals the end point of the titra-
tion, which if the proper indicator is cho-
sen lies very near the equivalence point. 
Acid–base titrations are discussed in more 
detail in Section 17.3.
Check The answer is reasonable because a
