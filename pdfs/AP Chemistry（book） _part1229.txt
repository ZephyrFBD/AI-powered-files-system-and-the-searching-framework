 form Na+1g2 for instance, 
requires 496 kJ>mol. Recall from Section 7.5 that when a nonmetal gains an electron, the 
process is generally exothermic, as seen from the negative electron affinities of the ele-
ments. Adding an electron to Cl(g), for example, releases 349 kJ>mol. From the magni-
tudes of these energies, we can see that the transfer of an electron from an Na atom to a 
Cl atom would not be exothermic—the overall process would be an endothermic process 
that requires 496 - 349 = 147 kJ>mol. This endothermic process corresponds to the 
formation of sodium and chloride ions that are infinitely far apart—in other words, the 
positive energy change assumes that the ions do not interact with each other, which is 
quite different from the situation in ionic solids.
The principal reason ionic compounds are stable is the attraction between ions of 
opposite charge. This attraction draws the ions together, releasing energy and causing 
many ions to form a solid array, or lattice, s
