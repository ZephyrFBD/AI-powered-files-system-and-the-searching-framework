strike and
ionize additional atoms. An “avalanche” of electrons is quickly produced, and
when it reaches the wire anode, it produces a voltage pulse. The pulse, after being
amplified, can be sent to an electronic counter, which counts how many particles
have been detected. Or the pulses can be sent to a loudspeaker and each detec-
tion of a particle is heard as a “click.” Only a fraction of the radiation emitted 
by a sample is detected by any detector.
A scintillation counter makes use of a solid, liquid, or gas known as a
scintillator or phosphor. The atoms of a scintillator are easily excited when struck
by an incoming particle and emit visible light when they return to their ground
states. Typical scintillators are crystals of NaI and certain plastics. One face of a
solid scintillator is cemented to a photomultiplier tube, and the whole is wrapped
with opaque material to keep it light-tight (in the dark) or is placed within a light-
tight container. The photomultiplier (PM) tube co
