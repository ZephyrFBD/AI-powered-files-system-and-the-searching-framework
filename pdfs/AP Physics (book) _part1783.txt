ons with other molecules before enzymes can attach it to the
growing chain (number 3 in Fig. 16–40). But the electrostatic force will often hold
a C opposite our G long enough so that an enzyme can attach the C to the growing
end of the new chain. Thus electrostatic forces are responsible for selecting the
bases in the proper order during replication. Note in Fig. 16–40 that the new
number 4 strand has the same order of bases as the old number 1 strand; and the
new number 3 strand is the same as the old number 2. So the two new double
helixes, 1–3 and 2–4, are identical to the original 1–2 helix. Hence the genetic
information is passed on accurately to the next generation.
This process of DNA replication is often presented as if it occurred in clock-
work fashion—as if each molecule knew its role and went to its assigned place. But
this is not the case. The forces of attraction are rather weak and become significant
only when charged parts of the two molecules have “complementary shape
