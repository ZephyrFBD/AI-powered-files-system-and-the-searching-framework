econdary consumers, tertiary consumers,
and quaternary consumers feed on the levels below them, such as the
primary consumers. Herbivores eat only plants (thus, they are always
primary consumers). However, some secondary and tertiary consumers
are omnivores, which eat both animals and plants. Omnivores in a food
web are indicated by arrows pointing toward them from both primary
producers and primary consumers.
AP EXPERT NOTE
It is important to understand productivity as it relates to energy
flow in food webs—many AP Biology exam questions will deal
with diﬀerences between gross and net primary productivity and
factors that influence productivity within a food chain or food
web.
Other simplified models illustrating how nutrients are cycled include
those for water, nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorous. These systems are
known as biogeochemical cycles.
In the water cycle, the Sun’s energy drives the movement of water
through the environment. The Sun causes surface water to evaporate and
