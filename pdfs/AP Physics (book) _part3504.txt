amma-ray
detector for scanning (moving) over a
patient. The collimator selects 
rays that
come in a (nearly) straight line from the
patient. Without the collimator,
rays from
all parts of the body could strike the
scintillator, producing a poor image.
Detectors today usually have many
collimator tubes and are called gamma
cameras. (b) Gamma camera image

Medical diagnosis
For medical diagnosis, the radionuclide commonly used today is 
a long-lived excited state of technetium-99 (the “m” in the symbol stands for
“metastable” state). It is formed when 
decays. The great usefulness of 
derives from its convenient half-life of 6 h (short, but not too short) and the
fact that it can combine with a large variety of compounds. The compound to be
labeled with the radionuclide is so
