e; see Figure 3.16. The sodium-potassium
pump moves Na+ and K+ ions against a gradient, pumping two
K+ ions for every three Na+ ions. The Na-K pump is the major
electrogenic pump in animals.

Homeostasis is maintained by the constant movement of molecules across a
membrane.
b)
Proton pumps are electrogenic pumps that actively pump
protons (H+) across a membrane against a gradient. By
generating voltage across membranes, they store energy that
can be tapped for cellular work. One important example is in
the cristae membranes of mitochondria in the production of
ATP during cellular respiration.
c)
Cotransport is another type of membrane pump. In this case,

a proton pump is linked to the transport of a second substance.
As shown in the diagram below, a cotransporter protein
translocates sucrose in plants against a gradient and into the
cell, but only if a sucrose molecule travels in the company of
