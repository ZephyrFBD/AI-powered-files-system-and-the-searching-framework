t than the
parents, the two species may fuse back into one species (Figure 18.25). Scientists have also observed that sometimes two
species will remain separate but also continue to interact to produce some hybrid individuals; this is classified as stability
because no real net change is taking place.
Varying Rates of Speciation
Scientists around the world study speciation, documenting observations both of living organisms and those found in the
fossil record. As their ideas take shape and as research reveals new details about how life evolves, they develop models
to help explain rates of speciation. In terms of how quickly speciation occurs, two patterns are currently observed: gradual
speciation model and punctuated equilibrium model.
In the gradual speciation model, species diverge gradually over time in small steps. In the punctuated equilibrium
model, a new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species, and then remains largely unchanged for long
periods of time afterw
