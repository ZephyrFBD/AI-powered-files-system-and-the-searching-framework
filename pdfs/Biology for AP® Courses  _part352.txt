molecules necessary for life that are built from smaller organic molecules. Macromolecules are made up of single units
known as monomers that are joined by covalent bonds to form larger polymers. The polymer is more than the sum of its
parts: it acquires new characteristics, and leads to an osmotic pressure that is much lower than that formed by its
ingredients; this is an important advantage in the maintenance of cellular osmotic conditions. A monomer joins with
another monomer with the release of a water molecule, leading to the formation of a covalent bond. These types of
reactions are known as dehydration or condensation reactions. When polymers are broken down into smaller units
(monomers), a molecule of water is used for each bond broken by these reactions; such reactions are known as hydrolysis
reactions. Dehydrat
