) 
Based on Table 1, identify a dependent variable in the researchers’ experiment. 
Accept one of the following: 
• 
APase activity 
• 
(Relative) amount of PHO1 (mRNA) 
1 point 
 
 
Justify the researchers’ using the wild-type strain for the creation of the mutant strains. 
Accept one of the following: 
• 
It ensures that any observed differences (in experimental results) between the strains 
are due to the introduced mutations (and not to other genetic differences between 
the yeast strains). 
• 
It ensures that the strains are genetically identical except for the introduced 
mutations. 
1 point 
 
Justify the researchers’ using mutant strains in which only a single component of the 
pathway was mutated in each strain. 
Accept one of the following:  
• 
It allows them to test the effect of each mutation separately. 
• 
It allows them to (better) determine which component is responsible for any observed 
differences.
