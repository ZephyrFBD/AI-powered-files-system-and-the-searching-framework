e (A) is incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes, which break
down macromolecules and cell parts. Vacuoles store water and other molecules in the cell, so choice (C) is
incorrect.
9. (D) Mitochondria and chloroplasts are not found in all eukaryotic cells; chloroplasts are only found in
eukaryotic cells that perform photosynthesis. Mitochondria and chloroplasts do have their own circular DNA as
well as their own ribosomes, and they both reproduce by binary fission, which are all characteristics they share
with prokaryotes. Thus, choices (A), (B), and (C) are all evidence of the endosymbiosis hypothesis.
10. (B) Movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration is diffusion,
a passive transport process. Choices (A), (C), and (D) all involve active transport and are therefore incorrect.
