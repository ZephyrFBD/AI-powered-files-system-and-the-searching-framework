lab frame before changing (“decaying”) into
other particles. In the rest frame of the particle, determine
(a) how long it lived before decaying, (b) how far it moved
before decaying.
15. (III) How fast must a pion be moving on average to travel
32 m before it decays? The average lifetime, at rest, is
26–7 Relativistic Momentum
16. (I) What is the momentum of a proton traveling at
17. (II) (a) A particle travels at
By what percentage
will a calculation of its momentum be wrong if you use the
classical formula? (b) Repeat for 
18. (II) A particle of mass m travels at a speed 
At
what speed will its momentum be doubled?
19. (II) An unstable particle is at rest and suddenly decays into
two fragments. No external forces act on the particle or its
fragments. One of the fragments has a speed of 0.60c and
a mass of 
while the other has a mass of
What is the speed of the less massive
fragment?
20. (II) What is the percent change in momentum of a proton
that accelerates from (a) 0.45c to 0.85c,
