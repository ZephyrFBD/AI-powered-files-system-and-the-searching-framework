-conditioner gases. Although they do not con-
tribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, HFCs are nevertheless 
potent greenhouse gases. For example, one of the by-product mole-
cules from production of HFCs that are used in commerce is HCF3, 
which is estimated to have a global warming potential, gram for 
gram, more than 14,000 times that of CO2. The total concentration 
of HFCs in the atmosphere has been increasing about 10% per year. 
Thus, these substances are becoming increasingly important con-
tributors to the greenhouse effect. Methane already makes a signif-
icant contribution to the greenhouse effect. Studies of atmospheric 
gas trapped long ago in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets show 
that the atmospheric methane concentration has increased from 
preindustrial values of 0.3 to 0.7 ppm to the present value of about 
1.8 ppm. The major sources of methane are associated with agricul-
ture and fossil-fuel use.
Methane is formed in biological processes that occur in low
