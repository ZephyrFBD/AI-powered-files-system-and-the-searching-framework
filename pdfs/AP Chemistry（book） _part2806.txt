 
Comparison of the reaction quotient, Q, with the value of Ksp can 
be used to judge whether a precipitate will form when solutions are 
mixed or whether a slightly soluble salt will dissolve under various 
conditions. Precipitates form when Q 7 Ksp. If two salts have suffi-
ciently different solubilities, selective precipitation can be used to 
precipitate one ion while leaving the other in solution, effectively 
separating the two ions.
QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS FOR METALLIC ELEMENTS (SEC-
TION 17.7) Metallic elements vary a great deal in the solubilities 
of their salts, in their acidâ€“base behavior, and in their tendencies 
to form complex ions. These differences can be used to separate 
and detect the presence of metal ions in mixtures. Qualitative anal-
ysis determines the presence or absence of species in a sample, 
whereas quantitative analysis determines how much of each species 
is present. The qualitative analysis of metal ions in solution can be 
carried out by separating the io
