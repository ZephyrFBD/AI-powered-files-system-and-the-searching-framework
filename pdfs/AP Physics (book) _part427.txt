22. (I) Sketch the free-body diagram of a baseball (a) at the
moment it is hit by the bat, and again (b) after it has left
the bat and is flying toward the outfield. Ignore air resistance.
23. (II) Arlene is to walk across a “high wire”strung horizontally
between two buildings 10.0 m apart. The sag in the rope
when she is at the midpoint is 10.0°, as shown in Fig. 4–47.
If her mass is 50.0 kg, what is the tension in the rope at this
point?
28. (II) The two forces

shown in Fig. 4–52a and b
(looking down) act on an 18.5-kg object on a frictionless
tabletop. If
