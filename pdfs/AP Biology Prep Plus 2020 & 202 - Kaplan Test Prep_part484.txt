 during fertilization, it will add one more copy of the
longer chromosome, for a total of three copies. (A) is thus correct. (B)
is incorrect because fertilization will lead to three copies of the longer
chromosome, not two. (C) and (D) are incorrect because gamete 2 has
one extra chromosome, not one fewer chromosome.

Learning Objective: 11.4
Like other features of meiotic division and fertilization, the primary
purpose of sexual reproduction is to increase the genetic fitness of a
population by increasing the extent of genetic diversity within the
population as a whole. (D) most directly references this purpose,
making it correct. Though there are error-checking mechanisms in
place to ensure the integrity of chromosomes, crossing over is not one
of those mechanisms, so (A) and (B) are both incorrect. Although (C)
provides an explanation in terms of the genetic fitness of progeny, the
“best” genes are selected by natural selection at an organismal level
and not at a molecular leve
