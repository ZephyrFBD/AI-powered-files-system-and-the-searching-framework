 If the body is gray, the wings
are normal; if the body is black, the wings are vestigial. However, a
small variation from the expected values occurred. Those numbers,
190 and 184, are due to crossing-over. Genes that are very close
together usually are inherited together. So these genes must be far
apart on the same chromosome.
(C) The two genes are linked and far apart on the same
chromosome.
(D) The coupling of exergonic and endergonic reactions is an
important biochemical strategy. The exergonic flow of electrons in
the cristae membrane of mitochondria provides the energy to pump
protons across the cristae membrane and maintain a gradient.
(D) An example of positive feedback occurs during labor and
childbirth. The pressure of the babyâ€™s head against sensors near the
opening of the uterus stimulates uterine contractions, which causes
even more pressure against the sensors and more contractions. This
continues until the baby is born, and then the process ceases.
Choices A and C are i
