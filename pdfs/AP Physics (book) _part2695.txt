eliminate reflected light at wavelengths (in air) around 550 nm when incident
normally on glass for which
APPROACH We explicitly follow the procedure outlined in the Problem Solving
Strategy on page 697.
SOLUTION
1. Interference effects. Consider two rays reflected from the front and rear sur-
faces of the coating on the lens as shown in Fig. 24â€“36. The rays are drawn
not quite perpendicular to the lens so we can see each of them. These two
reflected rays will interfere with each other.
2. Constructive interference. We want to eliminate reflected light, so we do not
consider constructive interference.
3. Destructive interference. To eliminate reflection, we want reflected rays 1
and 2 to be 
cycle out of phase with each other so that they destructively
interfere. The phase difference is due to the path difference 
traveled by
ray 2, as well as any phase change in either ray due to reflection.
4. Reflection phase shift. Rays 1 and
