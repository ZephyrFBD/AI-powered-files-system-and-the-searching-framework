that both are impermeable to
albumin but permeable to NaCl.
(C)
The membranes are similar in that both are impermeable to
albumin, but NaCl can permeate only across the dialysis tube
membrane.

Prokaryotes versus
Eukaryotes
There are two main types of cellsâ€”prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Prokaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes; they are composed of a
plasma membrane, cytoplasm, cell wall, DNA, ribosomes, and simple
microtubules. Bacteria are an example of prokaryotic cells. Eukaryotes
include both plant and animal cells. These cells are much more complex
than prokaryotes and contain numerous organelles.
PROKARYOTES
Prokaryotes are the more basic and simpler of the two major cell types.
These cells are considered to be the older form of cells. There are three
major regions of prokaryotic cells. The inside region is called the
cytoplasmic region. It contains the circular DNA that makes up the
genetic material of the cell. Because prokaryotes do not contain a
nucleus, DNA is condense
