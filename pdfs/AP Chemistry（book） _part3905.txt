ossible in alkenes because rotation about the C “ C 
double bond is restricted.
Alkenes and alkynes readily undergo addition reactions to the 
 
carbon–carbon multiple bonds. Additions of acids, such as HBr, pro-
ceed via a rate-determining step in which a proton is transferred to 
one of the alkene or alkyne carbon atoms. Addition reactions are dif-
ficult to carry out with aromatic hydrocarbons, but substitution reac-
tions are easily accomplished in the presence of catalysts.
ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUPS (SECTION 24.4) The chemistry 
of organic compounds is dominated by the nature of their functional 
groups. The functional groups we have considered are
