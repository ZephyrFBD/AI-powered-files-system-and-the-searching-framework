les. The last step in secretion is the
fusion of the secretory vesicle with the plasma membrane, releasing the
contents of the vesicle to the cellular exterior.
LYSOSOMES
Lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes involved in intracellular digestion
that break down proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. For white
blood cells, the lysosome may degrade bacteria or damaged cells. For a
protist, lysosomes may provide food for the cell. They also aid in
renewing a cellâ€™s own components by breaking them down and releasing
their molecular building blocks into the cytosol for reuse. A cell in injured
or dying tissue may rupture the lysosome membrane and release its
hydrolytic enzymes to digest its own cellular contents.
The lysosome maintains a slightly acidic pH of 5 in its interior, a pH at
which lysosomal enzymes are maximally active. The contents of the
lysosome are isolated from the cytoplasm by the lysosomal membrane,
keeping the pH distinct from the more neutral pH of the cytoplasm. The
