(d) Resistors, capacitors, and inductors can all change the
phase of the current.

6. A nonconducting plastic hoop is held in a magnetic field
that points out of the page (Fig. 21–54). As the strength
of the field increases,
(a) an induced emf will be produced that causes a
clockwise current.
(b) an induced emf will be produced that causes a
counterclockwise current.
(c) an induced emf will be produced but no current.
(d) no induced emf will be produced.
7. A long straight wire carries a current I as shown in
Fig.21–55. A small loop of wire rests in the plane of the page.
Which of the following will not induce a current in the loop?
(a) Increasing the current in the straight wire.
(b) Moving the loop in a direction parallel to the wire.
(c) Rotating the loop so that it becomes perpendicular to
the plane of the page.
(d) Moving the loop farther from the wire without rotating it.
(e) Moving the loop farther from the wire while rotating it.
8. Two separate but nearby coils are m
