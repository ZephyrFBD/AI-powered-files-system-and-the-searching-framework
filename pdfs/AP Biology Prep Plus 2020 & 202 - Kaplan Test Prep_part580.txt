2. If a particular gene product is needed during early development,
the gene must be turned on at the appropriate time. The default
setting is oﬀ and then the binding of an activator turns on the
gene when it is needed. Which statement gives the best
description of this type of gene control?
It is constitutive expression because the gene is expressed
throughout development.
(A)
It is positive control because the gene is turned on by the
presence of an activator once it is need
