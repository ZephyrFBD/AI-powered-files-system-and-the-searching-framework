Aqueous Equilibria
Sample Exercises 17.1 and 17.2 both involve weak acids. The ionization of a weak 
base is also decreased by the addition of a common ion. For example, the addition of 
NH4
+ (as from the strong electrolyte NH4Cl) causes the equilibrium concentrations of 
the reagents in Equation 17.2 to shift to the left, decreasing the equilibrium concentra-
tion of OH- and lowering the pH:
 
NH31aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ NH4
  +1aq2 + OH -1aq2 
[17.2]
Addition of NH4+ shifts equilibrium
concentrations, lowering [OH−]
Calculate the fluoride ion concentration and pH of a solution that is 0.20 M in HF and 0.10 M in HCl.
Sample Exercise 17.2 
Calculating Ion Concentrations When a Common Ion Is Involved
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to determine the concentration of F- and the 
pH in a solution containing the weak acid HF and the strong acid 
HCl. In this case the common ion is H+.
Plan We can again use the four steps outlined in Sample Exercise 17.1.
Solve 
Because HF is a weak acid and HCl is a
