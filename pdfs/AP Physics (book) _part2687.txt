Thickness of soap bubble skin. A soap bubble appears
green 
at the point on its front surface nearest the viewer. What is
the smallest thickness the soap bubble film could have? Assume 
APPROACH Assume the light is reflected perpendicularly from the point on a
spherical surface nearest the viewer, Fig. 24–34. The light rays also reflect from
the inner surface of the soap bubble film as shown. The path difference of these
two reflected rays is 
where is the thickness of the soap film. Light reflected
from the first (outer) surface undergoes a 180° phase change (index of refraction
of soap is greater than that of air), whereas reflection at the second (inner) sur-
face does not. To determine the thickness for an interference maximum, we
must use the wavelength of light in the soap 
SOLUTION The 180° phase change at only one surface is equivalent to a
path
difference. Therefore, green light is bright when the minimum path difference
