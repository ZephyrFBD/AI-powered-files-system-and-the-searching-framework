of a biological system. Aquatic animals, such as fishes, can release ammonia directly into the
environment. Animals that excrete ammonia are said to be ammonotelic. Terrestrial animals, including mammals, must
detoxify ammonia by converting it into relatively nontoxic forms such as uric acid or urea. Animals that secrete urea as
the primary nitrogenous waste material are called ureotelic animals. Birds and reptiles excrete uric acid, a water-insoluble
form of nitrogenous waste, thus reducing water loss. From an evolutionary standpoint, life likely started in an aquatic
environment, so it not surprising that biochemical pathways like the conversion of ammonia to urea typical in mammals
evolved to adapt to terrestrial conditions; more arid conditions probably led to the evolution of the uric acid pathway as a
means of conserving water.
