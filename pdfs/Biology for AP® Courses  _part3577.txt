The terminal bronchioles subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles. The respiratory bronchioles
subdivide into several alveolar ducts. Numerous alveoli and alveolar sacs surround the alveolar ducts. The alveolar sacs
resemble bunches of grapes tethered to the end of the bronchioles (Figure 30.10). In the acinar region, the alveolar ducts

are attached to the end of each bronchiole. At the end of each duct are approximately 100 alveolar sacs, each containing 20
to 30 alveoli that are 200 to 300 microns in diameter. Gas exchange occurs only in alveoli. Alveoli are made of thin-walled
parenchymal cells, typically one-cell thick, that look like tiny bubbles within the sacs. Alveoli are in direct contact with
capillaries (one-cell thick) of the circulatory system. Such intimate contact ensures that oxygen will diffuse from alveoli
into the blood and be distributed to the cells of t
