What mass of CaO, in grams, is needed to precipitate 1000 
lb of Mg1OH22?
 18.42  Gold is found in seawater at very low levels, about 0.05 ppb 
by mass. Assuming that gold is worth about $1300 per troy 
ounce, how many liters of seawater would you have to pro-
cess to obtain $1,000,000 worth of gold? Assume the den-
sity of seawater is 1.03 g>mL and that your gold recovery 
process is 50% efficient.
 18.43  Although there are many ions in seawater, the overall 
charges of the dissolved cations and anions must main-
tain charge neutrality. Consider only the six most abun-
dant ions in seawater, as listed in Table 18.5 (Cl−, Na+, 
SO42−, Mg2+, Ca2+, and K+), calculate the total charge in 
Coulombs of the cations in 1.0 L of seawater. Calculate 
the total charge in Coulombs of the anions in 1.0 L of sea-
water. To how many significant figures are the two num-
bers equal?
 18.44  The Ogallala aquifer described in the Closer Look box in 
Section 18.3, provides 82% of the drinking w
