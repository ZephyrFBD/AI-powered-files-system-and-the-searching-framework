isotonic between 10%
and 20% corn syrup 
The solution is isotonic when there is no
change in the mass of the egg (0 g falls
between 0.3 g and –6.1 g, which corresponds
to 10% and 20% corn syrup)
The egg from the 100% corn syrup solution
would increase in mass when placed in pure
distilled water
The concentration of water is greater outside
the egg than inside, so water will move into
the egg
result, water will move into the egg and cause it to swell.
2. Scoring Guidelines for Free-Response Question 2
(a) On the template provided, use the information in Table 1 to construct a
table scoring the number of nucleotide diﬀerences in the sequences between
each pair of species. (2 points)
Table components (1 point each, 2 points maximum)
