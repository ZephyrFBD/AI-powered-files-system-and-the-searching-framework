ls enable plants to grow tall.
Lignin embedded in xylem and other plant cells provides support.
Mycorrhizae are a type of fungus that live in plant roots and form a
symbiotic relationship with the plants. Nearly all plants on Earth rely on
mycorrhizae for enhanced uptake of nutrients and water from the soil. In
return, the plants provide the fungi with carbohydrates they formed during
photosynthesis. Fossil evidence demonstrates that mycorrhizae colonized
the land before plants 405 million years ago, perhaps enabling plants to
colonize land in the first place.
THE LEAF
The leaf is organized to maximize sugar production while minimizing
water loss. The epidermis is covered by a waxy cuticle made of cutin to
minimize water loss. Guard cells are modified epidermal cells that contain
chloroplasts, are photosynthetic, and control the opening of the stomates.
The inner part of the leaf consists of palisade and spongy mesophyll cells
whose function is photosynthesis. The cells in the palisade
