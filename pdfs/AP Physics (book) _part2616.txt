40.0 cm from the lens, the image moves 10.0 cm farther
from the lens. Find the focal length of this lens.
75. A 4.5-cm-tall object is placed 32 cm in front of a spherical
mirror. It is desired to produce a virtual image that is
upright and 3.5 cm tall. (a) What type of mirror should be
used? (b) Where is the image located? (c) What is the focal
length of the mirror? (d) What is the radius of curvature of
the mirror?
76. Light is emitted from an ordinary lightbulb filament in
wave-train bursts of about 
in duration. What is the
length in space of such wave trains?
77. If the apex angle of a prism is
(see Fig. 23–63),
what is the minimum incident angle for a ray if it is to emerge
from the opposite side (i.e., not be totally internally
reflected), given n = 1.58?
