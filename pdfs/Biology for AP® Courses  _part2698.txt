Figure 23.39 Azure bluets (Houstonia caerulea) display a phototropic response by bending toward the light. (credit:

In 1913, Peter Boysen-Jensen demonstrated that a chemical signal produced in the plant tip was responsible for the bending
at the base. He cut off the tip of a seedling, covered the cut section with a layer of gelatin, and then replaced the tip. The
seedling bent toward the light when illuminated. However, when impermeable mica flakes were inserted between the tip and
the cut base, the seedling did not bend. A refinement of the experiment showed that the signal traveled on the shaded side
of the seedling. When the mica plate was inserted on the illuminated side, the plant did bend towards the light. Therefore,
the chemical signal was a growth stimulant because the phototropic response involved faster cell elongation on the shaded
side than on the illuminated side. We now kn
