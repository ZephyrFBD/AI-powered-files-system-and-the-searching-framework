it increases the person’s comfort.
However, considering about the temperature of adding water, when the person’s
body temperature gets higher, the temperature will falls to the person’s body
temperature and then falls to
2
u . The later time will extend, which means people will
feel cold for a longer time. From this perspective, it decreases the person’s comfort.
Comprehensively, the two ways are opposite. .The later one is much dominant
because the temperature of water decreases slowly which will keeps a long time.
Hence, the higher the body temperature is, the higher the suffering degree is.
(3)Wasting water:
Wasting water is only up to the speed of adding hot water, the time of adding hot
water and the times of adding hot water, but these factors can be limited by the person,
so the wasting water is almost not disturbed by the body temperature.
(4)Conclusion:
The body temperature will have some impacts on our strategies before to some
extent.
Modification is to increase the temperat
