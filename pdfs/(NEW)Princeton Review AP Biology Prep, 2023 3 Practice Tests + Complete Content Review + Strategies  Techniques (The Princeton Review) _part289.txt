two copies of each gene, one on
each homologous chromosome. Homologous chromosomes are two copies or versions of the same chromosome
in a diploid cell or organism. Humans have 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes.
The two gene copies may be different from one another—that is, they may be alternate versions, or alleles, of
the same gene. For example, if we’re talking about the height of a pea plant, there’s an allele for tall and an
allele for short. In other words, both alleles are alternate forms of the gene for height.
Overall then, homologous chromosomes are the same size and shape, and
contain the same genes. However, they can contain different versions (or
alleles) of those genes, and thus have different genetic sequences.
When an organism has two identical alleles for a given trait, the organism is homozygous. If an organism has
two different alleles for a given trait, the organism is heterozygous.
When discussing the physical appearance of an organism, we refer to its phenotype. T
