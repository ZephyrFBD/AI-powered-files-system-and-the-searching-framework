The amount of waste generated by human
activities will decrease exponentially as the
human population continues to increase
exponentially. Removal of waste will require a
decrease in habitats, which will lead to decrease
in populations of species dependent on those
habitats.
96. A company wants to establish suspended cultures of
mussels in a natural estuary from which they can farm
mussels in a sustainable enterprise. The suspended cultures
would keep the mussels contained for easy capture, but
would allow free flow of estuary waters in and out of the
cultures. The company wants to know the maximum

a sustainable system. A biologist has suggested that the
limiting factor for mussels is the amount of phytoplankton
that the mussels feed on. Identify data that could best be
used to either justify or refute this suggestion.
