 glucose. In any redox
reaction, one substance is reduced while the other is oxidized.
Beyond the definitions of oxidation and reduction, there is an important
concept to understand. As hydrogen (with its electron) is transferred from

glucose to oxygen, it is moving from a higher energy level to a lower one,
releasing energy in stages. This free energy powers the synthesis of ATP.
ATPâ€”ADENOSINE TRIPHOSPHATE
A molecule of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) consists of adenosine (the
nucleotide adenine plus ribose) plus three phosphates. ATP is an unstable
molecule because the three phosphates in ATP are all negatively charged
and repel one another. When one phosphate group is removed from ATP
by hydrolysis, a more stable molecule, ADP (adenosine diphosphate),
results. The change, from a less stable molecule to a more stable molecule,
always releases energy. ATP provides energy for all cellular activities by
transferring phosphates from ATP to anoth
