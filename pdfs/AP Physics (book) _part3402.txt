Nuclear physics is the study of atomic nuclei. Nuclei contain
protons and neutrons, which are collectively known as nucleons.
The total number of nucleons, A, is the nucleus’s atomic mass
number. The number of protons, Z, is the atomic number. The
number of neutrons equals 
Isotopes are nuclei with
the same Z, but with different numbers of neutrons. For an
element X, an isotope of given Z and A is represented by
The nuclear radius is approximately proportional to 
indicating that all nuclei have about the same density. Nuclear
masses are specified in unified atomic mass units (u), where
the mass of 
(including its 6 electrons) is defined as exactly
12.000000 u. In terms of the energy equivalent (because
