e figure to explain how the introduction of Pd. to
the United States aﬀected the populations of M. lucifugus and E.
fuscus. (1 point)
Explanation (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Pd. first appeared in the United States in the winter of 2007. According
to the figure, from 2003 to 2009, the population of M. lucifugus
decreased while the population of E. fuscus population increased. This
Abiotic factors include sunlight, water, nutrients, temperature, and natural disasters.
Biotic factors include predators, prey, competitors, mating, and disease.
M. lucifugus population went down.
E. fuscus population went up.
suggests that E. fuscus is resistant to the fungus that causes white-nose
syndrome (WNS).
