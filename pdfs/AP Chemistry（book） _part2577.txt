in Kb denotes that the equilibrium constant refers 
to a particular type of reaction, namely, the ionization of a weak base in water. The con-
stant Kb, the base-dissociation constant, always refers to the equilibrium in which a base 
reacts with H2O to form the corresponding conjugate acid and OH-.
Table 16.4 lists the Lewis structures, conjugate acids, and Kb values for a number of 
weak bases in water. Appendix D includes a more extensive list. These bases contain one 
or more lone pairs of electrons because a lone pair is necessary to form the bond with H+. 
Notice that in the neutral molecules in Table 16.4, the lone pairs are on nitrogen atoms. 
The other bases listed are anions derived from weak acids.
Types of Weak Bases
Weak bases fall into two general categories. The first category is neutral substances that 
have an atom with a nonbonding pair of electrons that can accept a proton. Most of these 
bases, including all uncharged bases in Table 16.4, contain a nitrogen atom. Th
