ortant not to introduce contaminating microorganisms into the 
experiment. When students are working with the inoculation loops, pipettes, and agar 
plates, you should stress that the round circle at the end of the loop, the tip of the pipette, 
and the surface of the agar plate should not be touched or placed onto contaminating 
surfaces, such as bench tops. While some contamination will likely not ruin the 
investigation, students should practice sterile technique. You might consider having 
students do a dry run of the procedures to practice sterile technique before working with 
bacteria. 
Best results are obtained if starter plates are fresh (24–36 hr growth), with bacterial 
colonies measuring about 1–1.5 mm in diameter. Refrigeration of cultured plates will 
significantly lower transformation efficiency. The optimum temperature for growing  
E. coli is 37°C.
