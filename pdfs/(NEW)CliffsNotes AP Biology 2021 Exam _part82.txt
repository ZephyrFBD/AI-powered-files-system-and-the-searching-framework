e triphosphate) to transport materials across the
membrane. When energy is used for this purpose, the materials are said to be actively transported, and the process is
called active transport. The sodium-potassium pump, for example, uses ATP to
maintain higher concentrations of Na+ and K+ on opposite sides
of the plasma membrane.
Recognition proteins give each cell type a unique identification. This identification provides for a distinction
between cell types, between self cells and foreign cells, and between normal cells and cells infected with viruses.
Recognition proteins are actually glycoproteins, proteins with short polysaccharide chains that extend away from
the surface of the membrane. The differences between blood types, for example, are the result of recognition
proteins on the surface of red blood cells.
Receptor proteins provide binding sites for hormones or other trigger molecules. In response to the hormone or
trigger molecule, a specific cell response is activated.
