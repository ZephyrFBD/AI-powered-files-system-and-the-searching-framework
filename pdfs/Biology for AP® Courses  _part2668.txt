es water to move upwards from the roots through the xylem.
Which statement is false?
a.
Negative water potential draws water into the root hairs, cohesion and adhesion draw water up the xylem,
and transpiration draws water from the leaf.
b.
Negative water potential draws water into the root hairs, cohesion and adhesion draw water up the phloem,
and transpiration draws water from the leaf.
c.
Water potential decreases from the roots to the top of the plant.
d.
Water enters the plant through the root hairs and exits through stomata.
Transpiration—the loss of water vapor to the atmosphere through stomata—is a passive process, meaning that metabolic
energy in the form of ATP is not required for water movement. The energy driving transpiration is the difference in energy
between the water in the soil and the water in the atmosphere. However, transpiration is tightly controlled.
