to operate. The hexagonal intermetallic compound SmCo5, shown on the right-hand 
side of Figure 12.17, is used to make the permanent magnets found in lightweight head-
sets and high-fidelity speakers. A related compound with the same structure, LaNi5, is 
used as the anode in nickel-metal hydride batteries.

In the unit cell drawing on the right, why do we see eight Sm atoms and 
nine Co atoms if the empirical formula is SmCo5?

Chemistry Put to Work Alloys of Gold
Gold has long been a metal of choice for decorative objects, jewelry, 
and coins. The popularity of gold is driven by its unusual color (for a 
metal), its resistance to many chemi
