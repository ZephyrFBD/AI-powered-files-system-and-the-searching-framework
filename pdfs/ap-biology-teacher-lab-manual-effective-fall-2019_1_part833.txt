e always shows amount of reaction on the vertical 
scale and time on the horizontal scale. The corresponding rate curve may show time 
or some other variable on the horizontal scale, but it always shows rate, or amount of 
reaction per unit time, on the vertical scale. This point is very important. When we look 
at a rate curve that has time on the horizontal scale, we must visualize the progress curve 
from which the rate curve was derived. When we look at a rate curve that has any other 
variable except time on the horizontal scale, we shall see that each point on the rate 
curve represents a separate progress curve.
In the same way as for Process I, a rate curve can be made for Process II. Plotted on 
the same graph, the two should look something like the diagram in Figure A.12.
