24.2 Animal Primary Tissues
The basic building blocks of complex animals are four primary tissues. These are combined to form organs, which have a
specific, specialized function within the body, such as the skin or kidney. Organs are organized together to perform
common functions in the form of systems. The four primary tissues are epithelia, connective tissues, muscle tissues, and
nervous tissues.
24.3 Homeostasis
Homeostasis is a dynamic equilibrium that is maintained in body tissues and organs. It is dynamic because it is constantly
adjusting to the changes that the systems encounter. It is in equilibrium because body functions are kept within a normal
range, with some fluctuations around a set point for the processes.
