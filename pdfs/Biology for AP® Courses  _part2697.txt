 response. Like all
plant photoreceptors, phototropins consist of a protein portion and a light-absorbing portion, called the chromophore. In
phototropins, the chromophore is a covalently-bound molecule of flavin; hence, phototropins belong to a class of proteins
called flavoproteins.
Other responses under the control of phototropins are leaf opening and closing, chloroplast movement, and the opening of
stomata. However, of all responses controlled by phototropins, phototropism has been studied the longest and is the best
understood.
In their 1880 treatise The Power of Movements in Plants, Charles Darwin and his son Francis first described phototropism as
the bending of seedlings toward light. Darwin observed that light was perceived by the tip of the plant (the apical meristem),
but that the response (bending) took place in a different part of the plant. They concluded that the signal had to travel from
the apical meristem to the base of the plant.
