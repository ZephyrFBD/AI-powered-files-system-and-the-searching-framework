■Skills Development
Students will develop the following skills:
Bullet Formulating, testing, and revising a hypothesis based on logic and evidence
Bullet Using a sophisticated online bioinformatics program to analyze biological data
Bullet Analyzing evolutionary patterns using morphological data and DNA analysis
Bullet Analyzing preconstructed cladograms to demonstrate an understanding of 
evolutionary patterns
Bullet Designing cladograms to depict evolutionary patterns

■Potential Challenges
This lab is designed to be flexible and can be modified as desired. The amount of 
information on the BLAST website is a bit overwhelming — even for the scientists who 
use it on a frequent basis! Reassure students that a big part of this investigation is inquiry
and exploration of the data provided and that they are not expected to know every detail 
of the BLAST program.
