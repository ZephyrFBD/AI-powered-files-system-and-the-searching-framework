We would undoubtedly be arrogant to think that we could see the entire
universe. Indeed, theories assume that we cannot see everything, that the 
entire universe is greater than the observable universe, which is a sphere of
radius 
centered on the observer, with 
being the age of the universe.
We can never see further back than the time it takes light to reach us.
Consider, for example, an observer in another galaxy, very far from us,
located to the left of our observation point in Fig. 33–27. That observer would not
yet have seen light coming from the far right of the large circle in Fig. 33–27 that
we see—it will take some time for that light to reach her. But she will have already,
some time ago, seen the light coming from the left that we are seeing now. In 
fact, her
