are proteins that can turn on or turn off genes by binding to specific nucleotide sequences. The nucleotide sequences
to which these regulatory proteins bind are called regulatory sequences. Mutations in the genome may also affect
gene expression. This chapter will review how the expression of genes is regulated (in prokaryotes and in
eukaryotes) and the different types of mutations that can affect an organismâ€™s phenotype.
Regulation of Gene Expression in Prokaryotes
Prokaryotes use operons to regulate gene expression. An operon is a cluster of genes with a common function under
the control of a common promoter. Operons contain regulatory sequences, genes for regulatory proteins, and genes
for structural proteins (which are responsible for the function of the operon). An example of an operon is shown in
Figure 17.1.

Promoters are noncoding regulatory sequences that serve as binding sites for RNA polymerase. Operators are
noncoding regulatory sequences that s
