ubilities of gases and ionic 
solids in water respond differently to temperature. As you heat an aqueous solution 
that contains a gas, you give enough energy to the gas particles for them to escape 
from the solution and go into the gas phase. Thus, increasing temperature reduces the 
solubility of the gas. On the other hand, if you heat up a mixture of water and an ionic 
solid, you give energy to the solid so it can break into its constituent ions that are then 
hydrated by water. Thus, increasing temperature increases the solubility of the ionic 
solid.
13.4 âˆ£ Expressing Solution Concentration
The concentration of a solution can be expressed either qualitatively or quantitatively. 
The terms dilute and concentrated are used to describe a solution qualitatively. A solution 
with a relatively small concentration of solute is said to be dilute; one with a large con-
centration is said to be concentrated. Chemists use various ways to express concentration 
quantitatively, and we examin
