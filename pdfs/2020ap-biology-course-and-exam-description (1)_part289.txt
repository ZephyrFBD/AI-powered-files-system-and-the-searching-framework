5.C: Perform chi-square 
hypothesis testing.
Calculate the chi-square 
value of a given set of data.
Determine the p-value for a 
given set of data.
Draw conclusions about 
the experiment based on 
the comparison of the chi-
square value to the p-value.
Have students perform 
the animal behavior lab of 
your choice. They should 
formulate the null and 
alternative hypotheses and 
then calculate the chi-square 
test statistic. Once the chi-
square statistic has been 
calculated, students compare 
it to the p-value in order 
to compare the o
