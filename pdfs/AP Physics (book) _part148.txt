Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension
2â€“4 Acceleration
An object whose velocity is changing is said to be accelerating. For instance, a car
whose velocity increases in magnitude from zero to 
is accelerating.
Acceleration specifies how rapidly the velocity of an object is changing.
Average acceleration is defined as the change in velocity divided by the 
time taken to make this change:
In symbols, the average acceleration,
, over a time interval
during
which the velocity changes by
is defined as
[average acceleration]
(2;4)
We saw that velocity is a vector (it has magnitude and direction), so acceleration
is a vector too. But for one dimensional motion, we need only use a plus or minus
sign to indicate acceleration direction relative to a chosen coordinate axis.
(Usually, right is 
left is 
.)
The instantaneous acceleration, a, can be defined in an
