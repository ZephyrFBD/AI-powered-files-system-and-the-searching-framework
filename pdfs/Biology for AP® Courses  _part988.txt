a.
Loss of gases, mainly CO2 , will not affect
photosynthesis in the leaf, as adequate amounts
of water and light are still present which will let
the Calvin cycle run smoothly.
b.
Loss of gases, mainly CO2 , will affect
photosynthesis in the leaf, as the Calvin cycle
will become faster to compensate for the loss.
c.
Loss of gases, mainly CO2 , will not affect
photosynthesis in the leaf, as stored reservoirs of
CO2 in the leaf can be utilized in such times.
d.
Loss of gases, mainly CO2 , will affect
photosynthesis in the leaf, as the Calvin cycle
will slow down and possibly stop because of
inadequate carbon to fix in the system.
42. How do the cytochrome complex components involved
in photosynthesis contribute to the electron transport
chain?
a.
Photosystem I excites the electron as it moves
down the electron transport chain into
Photosystem II.
b.
Plastoquinone and plastocyanine perform redox
reactions that allow the electron to move
