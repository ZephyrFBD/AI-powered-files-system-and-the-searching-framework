pipette. (If students are using automatic pipetting devices, you should provide 
instruction on how to load and dispel minute samples.) The 100 μL, 250 μL, and 1 mL 
marks will be used as units of measurement. (You might need to remind students that 
“μl” and “μL” are alternative symbols for the same volumetric measurement.)

Another challenge area for students is transferring bacterial colonies from agar plates 
to microtubes. Students are tempted to scrape more bacterial colonies off the starter 
plate than are necessary. A single colony that is 1 mm in diameter contains millions of 
bacterial cells. To increase transformation efficiency, students should select 2–4 “fat” 
colonies that are 1–1.5 mm in diameter. Students should select individual colonies rather 
than a swab of bacteria from the dense portion of the plate. Remind students that “less is 
more.”
