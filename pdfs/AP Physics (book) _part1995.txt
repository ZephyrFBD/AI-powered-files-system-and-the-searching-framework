†A graph of 
versus is identical to that for 
in Fig. 18–22, except that the points are shifted
(by cycle) on the time axis. Thus the average value of

averaged over one or more full cycles,

we can write
Hence the average value of

The rms values of V and I are sometimes called the effective values. They are
useful because they can be substituted directly into the power formulas, Eqs. 18–5
and 18–6, to get the average power:
(18;9a)
(18;9b)
(18;9c)
Thus, a direct current whose values of I and V equal the rms values of I and V for
an alternating current will produce the same power. Hence it is usually the rms
value of
