oxidized (because 
both already have their elements in their highest common oxidation state). Both the 
H2O solvent and the Ni atoms in the anode, however, can undergo oxidation:
 
 
2 H2O1l2 ¡ O21g2 + 4 H+1aq2 + 4 e- 
E°
red = +1.23 V
 
 
  Ni1s2 ¡ Ni2+1aq2 + 2 e- 
E°
red = -0.28 V
We saw in Section 20.4 that the half-reaction with the more negative E°
red undergoes 
oxidation more readily. (Remember Figure 20.11: The strongest reducing agents, which 
are the substances oxidized most readily, have the most negative E°
red values.) Thus, it is 
the Ni(s), with its E°
red = -0.28 V, that is oxidized at the anode rather than the H2O. If 
we look at the overall reaction, it appears as if nothing has been accomplished. However, 
this is not true because Ni atoms are transferred from the Ni anode to the steel cathode, 
plating the steel with a thin layer of nickel atoms.
The standard emf for the overall reaction is
 E°
cell = E°
red 1cathode2 - E°
red 1anode2 = 1-0.28 V2 - 1-0.28 V2 = 0
