d (Section 27â€“6). The charged
particles produced in all of these processes can themselves go on to produce further
ionization. Neutrons, on the other hand, interact with matter mainly by collisions
with nuclei, with which they interact strongly. Often the nucleus is broken apart by
such a collision, altering the molecule of which it was a part. The fragments
produced can in turn cause ionization.
Radiation passing through matter can do considerable damage. Metals and
other structural materials become brittle and their strength can be weakened if
the radiation is very intense, as in nuclear reactor power plants and for space
vehicles that must pass through areas of intense cosmic radiation.
Biological Damage
The radiation damage produced in biological organisms is due primarily to ion-
ization produced in cells. Several related processes can occur. Ions or radicals are
produced that are highly reactive and take part in chemical reactions that interfere
with the normal operation of the c
