y. On the other hand, 12 of chlorine’s 
17 electrons form closed shells, or subshells (corresponding to 
).
These 12 electrons form a spherically symmetric shield around the nucleus. The
other five electrons are in 3p states whose probability distributions are not spher-
ically symmetric and have a form similar to those for the 2p states in hydrogen
shown in Figs. 28–9b and c. Four of these 3p electrons can have “doughnut-
shaped” distributions symmetric about the z axis, as shown in Fig. 29–5. The fifth
can have a “barbell-shaped” distribution (as for
in Fig. 28–9b), which in
Fig. 29–5 is shown only in dashed outline because it is half empty. That is, the
exclusion principle allows one more electron to be in this state (it will have spin
opposite to that of the electron already there). If an extra electron—say from a
Na atom—happens to be in the vicinity, it can be in this state, perhaps at point x
in Fig. 29–5. It could experience an attraction due to as much as 
because the
