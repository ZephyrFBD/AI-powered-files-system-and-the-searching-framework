that point.
The lobes of the wave functions for the d orbitals also have 
different phases. For example, the wave function for a dxy orbital 
has four lobes, with the phase of each lobe opposite the phase 
of its nearest neighbors (Figure 9.39). The wave functions for the 
*The mathematical development of this three-dimensional func-
tion (and its square) is beyond the scope of this book, and, as is 
typically done by chemists, we have used lobes that are the same 
shape as in Figure 6.23.
