ve period π : 
tan(x + π ) = tan x 
We first sketch the graph of tangent. Since it has period π, we need to only sketch the 
graph on any interval of length π and then repeat the pattern to the left and to the right.  
We sketch the graph on the interval (-π/2, π/2) 
Since tan(π/2)  and tan(-π/2) are not defined, we need to be careful in sketching the graph 
at points near -π/2 and π/2. 
Thus, the graph of y = tan x approaches the vertical lines  
 and

So these lines are vertical asymptotes. 
With the information we have so far, we sketch the graph of y = tan x on the interval (-π/2, 
π/2). 
 
The complete graph of tangent is now obtained by using the fact that tangent is periodic 
with period π.

3.4.2 Transformations of Graphs of Tangent 
We now consider graphs of transformations of the tangent functions. 
Since the tangent functions have period , the functions y = a tan kx (k > 0), complete one 
period as kx varies from 0 to . 
The functions y =
