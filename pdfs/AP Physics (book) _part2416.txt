5. (III) A physics professor wants to demonstrate the large size
of the henry unit. On the outside of a 12-cm-diameter plastic
hollow tube, she wants to wind an air-filled solenoid with
self-inductance of 1.0 H using copper wire with a 0.81-mm
diameter. The solenoid is to be tightly wound with each turn
touching its neighbor (the wire has a thin insulating layer
on its surface so the neighboring turns are not in electrical
contact). How long will the plastic tube need to be and how
many kilometers of copper wire will be required? What will
be the resistance of this solenoid?
*46. (III) A long thin solenoid of length 
and cross-sectional
area A contains 
closely packed turns of wire. Wrapped
tightly around it is an insulated coil of 
turns, Fig. 21–63.
Assume all the flux from
coil 1 (the solenoid)
passes through coil 2,
and calculate the
mutual inductance.
