eptor (B), and a gated ion receptor (C). Although these receptor proteins have distinctive physical
features, you won’t be required to recognize them solely on their appearance.
2. B. Molecule M, the intracellular receptor protein, acts as an activator that promotes the transcription of DNA.
Transcription produces an mRNA that, when translated, produces the protein labeled “protein P.”
3. C. Protein P is the protein product that is made as a result of the action of testosterone. Therefore, it initiates
cellular processes responsible for producing male characteristics.
4. A. An XY individual usually bears the male phenotype. However, if the testosterone receptor protein (molecule M
in the figure) is nonfunctional, testosterone has no effect and the female phenotype results. In humans, female
characteristics result when the maledetermining-factor is absent (not when a female-determining factor is present).
5. A. Fruit flies preferred ripe bananas over all other substances. These data gri
