For example, Cl- is the conjugate base of HCl, and CH3COO- is the conjugate base of 
CH3COOH. Whether an anion reacts with water to produce hydroxide ions depends on the 
strength of the anion’s conjugate acid. To identify the acid and assess its strength, we add 
a proton to the anion’s formula. If the acid HA determined in this way is one of the seven 
strong acids listed at the beginning of Section 16.5, the anion has a negligible tendency to 
produce OH - ions from water and does not affect the pH of the solution. The presence of 
Cl- in an aqueous solution, for example, does not result in the production of any OH - and 
does not affect the pH. Thus, Cl- is always a spectator ion in acid–base chemistry.
If HA is not one of the seven common strong acids, it is a weak acid. In this case, the 
conjugate base A- is a weak base, and it reacts to a small extent with water to produce the 
weak acid and hydroxide ions:
 
A-1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ HA1aq2 + OH -1aq2
