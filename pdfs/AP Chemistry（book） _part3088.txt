e value for ∆G indicates a larger “driving force” to 
produce NH3.
We would make the same prediction based on Le Châtelier’s 
principle. 
 (Section 15.7) Relative to standard conditions, we 
have increased the pressure of a reactant 1H22 and decreased the 
pressure of the product 1NH32. Le Châtelier’s principle predicts 
that both changes shift the reaction to the product side, thereby 
forming more NH3.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of the following statements is true? (a) The larger 
the Q, the larger the ∆G°. (b) If Q = 0, the system is at equi-
librium. (c) If a reaction is spontaneous under standard 
conditions, it is spontaneous under all conditions. (d) The 
free-energy change for a reaction is independent of tempera-
ture. (e) If Q 7 1, ∆G 7 ∆G°.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Calculate ∆G at 298 K for the Haber reaction if the reaction 
mixture consists of 0.50 atm N2, 0.75 atm H2, and 2.0 atm NH3.
Give It Some Thought
Can K = 0?
