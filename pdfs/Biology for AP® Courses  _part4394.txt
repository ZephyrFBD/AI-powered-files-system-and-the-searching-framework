ere they are built. Humans, however,
have the ability to alter their environment to increase its carrying capacity sometimes to the detriment of other species (e.g.,
via artificial selection for crops that have a higher yield). Earth’s human population is growing rapidly, to the extent that
some worry about the ability of the earth’s environment to sustain this population, as long-term exponential growth carries
the potential risks of famine, disease, and large-scale death.

Although humans have increased the carrying capacity of their environment, the technologies used to achieve this
transformation have caused unprecedented changes to Earth’s environment, altering ecosystems to the point where some
may be in danger of collapse. The depletion of the ozone layer, erosion due to acid rain, and damage from global climate
change are caused by human activities. The ultimate effect of these changes on our carrying capacity is unknown. As som
