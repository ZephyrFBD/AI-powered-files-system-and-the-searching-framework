Stony corals make their exoskeletons from dissolved Ca2 +  and CO3
2 -  
ions. This process is aided by the fact that the CO3
2 -  concentra-
tion is supersaturated in most parts of the ocean. However, well- 
documented increases in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere threaten 
to upset the aqueous chemistry that stony corals depend on. As atmo-
spheric CO2 levels increase, the amount of CO2 dissolved in the ocean 
also increases. This lowers the pH of the ocean and leads to a decrease in 
the CO3
2 -  concentration. As a result, it becomes more difficult for stony 
corals and other important ocean creatures to maintain their exoskele-
tons. We will take a closer look at the consequences of ocean acidifica-
tion later in the Chapter 18.

Water, the most common and  
most important solvent on Earth, occupies its 
position of importance because of its abundance 
and its exceptional ability to dissolve a wide 
variety of substances. Coral reefs are a striking
