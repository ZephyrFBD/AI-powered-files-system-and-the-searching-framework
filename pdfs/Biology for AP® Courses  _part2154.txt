e, by wind or by bird, to pollinate other populations of the same species some
distance away. Even a population that may initially appear to be stable, such as a pride of lions, can experience its fair share
of immigration and emigration as developing males leave their mothers to seek out a new pride with genetically unrelated
females. This variable flow of individuals in and out of the group not only changes the gene structure of the population, but
it can also introduce new genetic variation to populations in different geological locations and habitats.
Figure 19.6 Gene flow can occur when an individual travels from one geographic location to another.
Mutation
Mutations are changes to an organismâ€™s DNA and are an important driver of diversity in populations. Species evolve
because of the accumulation of mutations that occur over time. The appearance of new mutations is the most common
way to introduce novel genotypic and phenotypic variance. Some mutations are unfavorable or harmful
