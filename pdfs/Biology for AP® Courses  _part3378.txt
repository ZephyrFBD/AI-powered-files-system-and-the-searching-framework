 females. They do not affect sexual characteristics and may supplement sex hormones released from the gonads.
Adrenal Medulla
The adrenal medulla contains large, irregularly shaped cells that are closely associated with blood vessels. These cells are
innervated by preganglionic autonomic nerve fibers from the central nervous system.
The adrenal medulla contains two types of secretory cells: one that produces epinephrine (adrenaline) and another that
produces norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Epinephrine is the primary adrenal medulla hormone accounting for 75 to 80
percent of its secretions. Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase heart rate, breathing rate, cardiac muscle contractions,
blood pressure, and blood glucose levels. They also accelerate the breakdown of glucose in skeletal muscles and stored fats
in adipose tissue.
The release of epinephrine and norepinephrine is stimulated by neural impulses from the sympathetic nervous system.
Secretion of these hormones is stimulated by ac
