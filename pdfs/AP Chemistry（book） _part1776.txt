 digital watches, televisions, and computers. They 
can be used for these applications because the weak intermolecular forces that hold the 
molecules together in the liquid crystalline phase are easily affected by changes in tem-
perature, pressure, and electric fields.
types of Liquid Crystals
Substances that form liquid crystals are often composed of rod-shaped molecules that 
are somewhat rigid. In the liquid phase, these molecules are oriented randomly. In the 
liquid crystalline phase, by contrast, the molecules are arranged in specific patterns as

(a) The critical point is the point where the liquid, gaseous, and 
supercritical ﬂuid phases coexist. It is marked point 3 in the 
phase diagram and located at approximately -80 °C and 
50 atm.
(b) The triple point is the point where the solid
