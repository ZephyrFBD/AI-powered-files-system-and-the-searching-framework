ch
are extensively folded and embedded in the membrane (Figure 5.5). This type of protein has a hydrophilic region or regions,
and one or several mildly hydrophobic regions. This arrangement of regions of the protein tends to orient the protein
alongside the phospholipids, with the hydrophobic region of the protein adjacent to the tails of the phospholipids and the
hydrophilic region or regions of the protein protruding from the membrane and in contact with the cytosol or extracellular
fluid.

Figure 5.5 Integral membranes proteins may have one or more alpha-helices that span the membrane (examples 1
and 2), or they may have beta-sheets that span the membrane (example 3). (credit: “Foobar”/Wikimedia Commons)
Peripheral proteins are found on the exterior and interior surfaces of membranes, attached either to integral proteins or
to phospholipids. Peripheral proteins, along with integral proteins, may serve as enzymes, as structur
