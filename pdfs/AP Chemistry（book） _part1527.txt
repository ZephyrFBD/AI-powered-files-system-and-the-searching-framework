y s bonds and how many 
p bonds does the central nitrogen atom make in the azide ion?
 
[9.101] In ozone, O3, the two oxygen atoms on the ends of the mol-
ecule are equivalent to one another. (a) What is the best 
choice of hybridization scheme for the atoms of ozone? 
 
(b) For one of the resonance forms of ozone, which of the 
orbitals are used to make bonds and which are used to hold 
nonbonding pairs of electrons? (c) Which of the orbitals 
can be used to delocalize the p electrons? (d) How many 
electrons are delocalized in the p system of ozone?

Butadiene, C4H6, is a planar molecule that has the follow-
ing carbon–carbon bond lengths:
1.34 Å
1.34 Å
1.48 Å
H2C
CH
CH
CH2
 
 
(a) Predict the bond angles around each of the carbon at-
oms and sketch the molecule. (b) From left to right, what 
is the hybridization of each carbon atom in butadiene? 
(c) The middle C ¬ C bond length in butadiene (1.48 Å) is 
a little shorter than the average C ¬ C single bond length 
 
(1.54 Å).
