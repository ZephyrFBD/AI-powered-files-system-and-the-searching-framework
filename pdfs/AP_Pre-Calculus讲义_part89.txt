When two objects are moving in simple harmonic motion with the same frequency, it is 
often important to determine whether the objects are “moving together” or by how much 
their motions differ. Let’s consider a specific example. 
Suppose that an object is rotating along the unit circle and the height y of the object at time 
t is given by y = sin(kt − b). When t = 0, the height is y = sin(−b). 
This means that the motion “starts” at an angle b as shown.

We can view the starting point in two ways: as the angle between P and Q on the unit 
circle or as the time required for P to “catch up” to Q. The angle b is called the phase (or 
phase angle). To find the time required, we factor out k:

We see that P “catches up” to Q (that is, y = 0) when t=b/k. 
This last equation also shows that the graph is shifted horizontally b/k on the t-axis.
