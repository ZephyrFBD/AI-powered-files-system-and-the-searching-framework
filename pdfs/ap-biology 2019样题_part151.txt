UNIT
5
TOPIC 5.1
Meiosis
SUGGESTED SKILL
Concept Explanation
1.B
Explain biological concepts 
and/or processes.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-1.F
Explain how meiosis results 
in the transmission of 
chromosomes from one 
generation to the next.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.F.1
Meiosis is a process that ensures the formation 
of haploid gamete cells in sexually reproducing 
diploid organisms—
a. Meiosis results in daughter cells with half the 
number of chromosomes of the parent cell. 
b. Meiosis involves two rounds of a sequential 
series of steps (meiosis I and meiosis II).
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
IST-1
Heritable information provides for continuity of life.
