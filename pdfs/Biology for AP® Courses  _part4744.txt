Present-Time Extinctions
The sixth, or Holocene, mass extinction appears to have begun earlier than previously believed and has mostly to do with the
activities of Homo sapiens. Since the beginning of the Holocene period, there are numerous recent extinctions of individual
species that are recorded in human writings. Most of these are coincident with the expansion of the European colonies since

One of the earlier and popularly known examples is the dodo bird. The dodo bird lived in the forests of Mauritius, an island
