lative lengths of day and night. Plants have
a biological clock set to a 24-hour day, known as a circadian rhythm. The
physiological response to the photoperiod, such as flowering, is known as
photoperiodism. Some plants will flower only when the light period is
longer than a certain number of hours. These plants are called long-day
plants. Some plants are short-day plants, and some are day-neutral and
will flower regardless of the length of day. Plants actually respond to the
length of darkness, not the length of light. So despite its name, a long-day
plant is actually a short-night plant.
IMPORTANT TIP
The timing and coordination of physiological events are regulated by multiple mechanisms.
Early summer has short periods of darkness that induce flowering in
long-day plants (such as an iris), but not in short-day plants (such as a
