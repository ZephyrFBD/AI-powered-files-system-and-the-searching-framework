cent of the energy received is passed from one
trophic level to the next.
Food webs can quickly become quite complicated because there are so
many diï¬€erent organisms interacting in any given ecosystem. Food webs
are rarely entirely comprehensive for the same reason. As one kind of
organism feeds another, nutrition moves through a food web from one
Food Web
trophic level to the next. Organisms included in a food web may be
primary producers (autotrophs), which produce energy from sunlight,
primary consumers and secondary consumers, and decomposers.
Because they make their own food, primary producers only have arrows
pointing away from them in a food web. Organisms that get energy by
consuming other living things (heterotrophs) have arrows pointing
toward them, indicating the flow of energy from another trophic level. If
decomposers are part of the food web, there will also be arrows leading
from the various levels of heterotrophs to the decomposers. Primary
consumers eat plants, while s
