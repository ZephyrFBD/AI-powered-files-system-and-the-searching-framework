 in the expression defining a linear function the variable occurs to the first power only. 
We can also express a linear function in equation form as  
y = ax + b. 
 
A linear function is a function of the form f(x) = ax + b. 
The graph of a linear function is a line with slope a and y-intercept b. 
 
Example 1: 
Determine whether the given function is linear. If the function is linear, express the function 
in the form f (x) = ax + b. 
(a) f (x) = 2 + 3x 
(b) g(x) = 3(1 âˆ’ 2x)  
(c) h(x) = x(4 + 3x) 
 
 
 
 
 
1.4.2 Rate of Change in Linear Functions 
Let f (x) = ax + b be a linear function. 
If x1 and x2 are two different values for x and if y1 = f (x1) and y2 = f (x2), then the points (x1, 
y1) and (x2, y2) lie on the graph of f. 
From the definitions of slope and average rate of change we have

We know that the slope of a linear function is the same between any two points.
