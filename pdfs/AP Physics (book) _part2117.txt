ctually passing through the heart), but as little as 0.02 mA can
cause fibrillation when passing directly to the heart. Thus, a “wired” patient is in
considerable danger from leakage current even from as simple an act as touching
a lamp.
Finally, don’t touch a downed power line (lethal!) or even get near it. A hot
power line is at thousands of volts. A huge current can flow along the ground
from the point where the high-voltage wire touches the ground. This current is great
enough that the voltage between your two feet could be large and dangerous.
Tip: stand on one foot, or run so only one foot touches the ground at a time.

Affects the Quantity Being Measured
Measurement is a fundamental part of physics, and is not as simple as you might
think. Measuring instruments can not be taken for granted; their results are not
perfect and often ne
