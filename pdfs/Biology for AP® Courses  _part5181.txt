ase. If the microorganism
is a bacteria or fungus it must be grown in a pure culture. If it is a virus, it must be puriﬁed
(i.e. containing no other material except the virus particles) from a clinical sample.
3. The speciﬁc disease, with all of its characteristics, must be reproduced when the
infectious agent (the puriﬁed virus or a pure culture of bacteria or fungi) is inoculated into a
healthy, susceptible host.
4. The microorganism must be recoverable from the experimentally infected host as in step
2.
Not one of these criteria has been met in the case of ‘SARS-Cov-2’ and
‘Covid-19’. Not ONE. EVER. Robert Koch refers to bacteria and not
viruses. What are called ‘viral particles’ are so minute (hence masks
are useless by any deﬁnition) that they could only be seen aĞer the

virologist Thomas Milton Rivers, the so-called ‘Father of Modern
Virology’ who was v
