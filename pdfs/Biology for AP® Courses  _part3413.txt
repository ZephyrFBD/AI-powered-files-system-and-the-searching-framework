d.
Hormones mediate changes by directly binding
to the intracellular hormone receptors.
37. A new hormone is discovered that binds to receptors
on the target cell surface. Describe the chemical class of
hormone that this hormone could belong to and explain
how you could discern the exact class.
a.
It belongs to the class lipid-derived or peptide
hormone as it is water insoluble and thus
requires a cell surface receptor. The exact class
can be determined on the basis of the hormoneâ€™s
size.
b.
It belongs to the class amino acid derived
hormones as it is lipid insoluble and thus
requires a cell surface receptor. This can be
discerned by determining the exact structure of
the hormone.
c.
It belongs to the class lipid-derived or peptide
hormone as it is water insoluble and thus
requires a cell surface receptor. This can be
discerned by determining the exact structure of
the hormone.
d.
It belongs to the class amino acid derived or
peptide hormone as it is lipid insoluble and thus
