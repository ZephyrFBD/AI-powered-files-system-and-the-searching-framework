tructural 
components: a five-carbon sugar 
(deoxyribose or ribose), a phosphate, and a 
nitrogen base (adenine, thymine, guanine, 
cytosine, or uracil). DNA and RNA differ in 
structure and function.
Bullet	In proteins, the specific order of amino 
acids in a polypeptide (primary structure) 
determines the overall shape of the protein. 
Amino acids have directionality, with 
an amino (NH2) terminus and a carboxyl 
(COOH) terminus. The R group of an amino 
acid can be categorized by chemical 
properties (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or 
ionic), and the interactions of these R groups 
determine structure and function of that 
region of the protein. 
c. Complex carbohydrates comprise sugar 
monomers whose structures determine the 
properties and functions of the molecules.
