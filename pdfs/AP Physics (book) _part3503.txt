the film most strongly where the isotope is most strongly concentrated (Fig. 31–19a).
Autoradiography using labeled nucleotides (components of DNA) has revealed
much about the details of DNA replication (Fig. 31–19b). Today gamma cameras
are used in a similar way—see next page.

†To “collimate” means to “make parallel,” usually by blocking non-parallel rays with a narrow tube
inside lead, as in Fig. 31–20a.
