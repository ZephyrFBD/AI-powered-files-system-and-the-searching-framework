rom athletics is shown in Fig. 7–27.
If high jumpers can get into the position shown, their CM can pass below the 
bar which their bodies go over, meaning that for a particular takeoff speed, they
can clear a higher bar. This is indeed what they try to do.

7–10 CM and Translational Motion
As mentioned in Section 7–8, a major reason for the importance of the concept
of center of mass is that the motion of the CM for a system of particles (or an
extended object) is directly related to the net force acting on the system as a
whole. We now show this, taking the simple case of one-dimensional motion
(x direction) and only three particles, but the extension to more objects and to
three dim
