ciated with the lipid
bilayer (peripheral proteins). They are located on the inner or outer surface of the membrane. Others are firmly
bound to the plasma membrane (integral proteins). These proteins are amphipathic, which means that their
hydrophilic regions extend out of the cell or into the cytoplasm, while their hydrophobic regions interact with the
tails of the membrane phospholipids. Some integral proteins extend all the way through the membrane
(transmembrane proteins).
This arrangement of phospholipids and proteins is known as the fluid-mosaic model. This means that each layer of
phospholipids is flexible, and it is a mosaic because it is peppered with different proteins and carbohydrate chains.
Remember, anything hydrophilic should not go through the hydrophobic interior. This means that the phospholipids
on one side should never flip-flop to the other side of the membrane (because that would require their polar heads to
pass through the hydrophobic area).
