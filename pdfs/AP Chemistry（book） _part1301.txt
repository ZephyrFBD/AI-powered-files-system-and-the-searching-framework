Dominant
We usually represent BF3 solely by the dominant resonance structure, in which there are 
only six valence electrons around boron. The chemical behavior of BF3 is consistent with this 
representation. In particular, BF3 reacts energetically with molecules having an unshared 
pair of electrons that can be used to form a bond with boron, as, for example, in the reaction

In the stable compound NH3BF3, boron has an octet of valence electrons.
More than an Octet of Valence Electrons
The third and largest class of exceptions consists of molecules or polyatomic ions in 
which there are more than eight electrons in the valence shell of an atom. When we draw 
the Lewis structure for PF5, for example, we are forced to place ten electrons around the 
central phosphorus atom:
