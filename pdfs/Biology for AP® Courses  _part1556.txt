emoved
DNA fragment that is synthesized in short stretches on the lagging strand
mutation that affects a single base
enzyme that synthesizes the RNA primer; the primer is needed for DNA pol to start synthesis of a new DNA
strand
short stretch of nucleotides that is required to initiate replication; in the case of replication, the primer has RNA
nucleotides
function of DNA pol in which it reads the newly added base before adding the next one
Y-shaped structure formed during initiation of replication
mutation that is not expressed
during replication, protein that binds to the single-stranded DNA; this helps in keeping
the two strands of DNA apart so that they may serve as templates
ring-shaped protein that holds the DNA pol on the DNA strand
mutation that takes place in the cells as a result of chemical reactions taking place naturally
without exposure to any external agent
enzyme that contains a catalytic part and an inbuilt RNA template; it functions to maintain telomeres at
chromosome
