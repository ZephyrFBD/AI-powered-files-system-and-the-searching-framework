 Mam says she can’t spend another minute in that room on Hartstonge 
 
 Street. She sees Eugene morning, noon and night. She sees him 
 
 climbing the bed to look out at the street for Oliver and sometimes she 
 
 sees Oliver outside and Eugene inside, the two of them chatting away. 
 
 She’s happy they’re chatting like that but she doesn’t want to be seeing 
 
 and hearing them the rest of her life. It’s a shame to move when we’re 
 
 so near Leamy’s National School but if she doesn’t move soon she’ll go 
 
 out of her mind and wind up in the lunatic asylum. 
 
 We move to Roden Lane on top of a place called Barrack Hill. 
 
 There are six houses on one side of the lane, one on the opposite side. 
 
 The houses are called two up, two down, two rooms on top, two on the 
 
 bottom. Our house is at the end of the lane, the last of the six. Next to 
 
 our door is a small shed, a lavatory, and next to that a stable.
