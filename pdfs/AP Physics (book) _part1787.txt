ut on it, Fig. 16–41. In step 3, a fine dark powder known as toner
is given a negative charge, and is brushed on the drum as it rotates. The negatively
charged toner particles are attracted to the positive areas on the drum (the A in
our case) and stick only there. In step 4, the rotating drum presses against a piece
of paper which has been positively charged more strongly than the selenium, so
the toner particles are transferred to the paper, forming the final image. Finally,
step 5, the paper is heated to fix the toner particles firmly on the paper.
In a color copier (or printer), this process is repeated for each color—black,
cyan (blue), magenta (red), and yellow. Combining these four colors in different
proportions produces any desired color.

from being “expressed”—that is, translated into the proteins they code for (see Section 29–3).
