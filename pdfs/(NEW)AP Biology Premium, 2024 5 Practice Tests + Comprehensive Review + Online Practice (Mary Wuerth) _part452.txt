13. Wild guppies (Poecilia reticulata) live in ponds on the island of Trinidad. Male guppies have great variation in
the number and colors of spots, leading to a wide variety of color patterns among male guppies. Female
guppies do not express these spots and are drably colored. Female guppies will more often choose to mate with
males who possess bright color patterns. However, males with brighter color patterns are more visible to
predators. An experiment was performed to measure the effect of the presence of a guppy predator (Cichlidae
alta) on the number of spots in male guppies. Guppies were placed into two different environments: one with
no predators and the other in which C. alta was present. Guppies were allowed to reproduce in both
environments for 20 generations. After 20 generations, the number of spots on each male gup
