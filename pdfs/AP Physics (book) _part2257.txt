le equi-
librium due to the magnetic force of the upper wire? Explain.
21. What would be the effect on B inside a long solenoid if
(a) the diameter of all the loops was doubled, (b) the spacing
between loops was doubled, or (c) the solenoid’s length was
doubled along with a doubling in the total number of loops?
22. A type of magnetic switch similar to a solenoid is a relay
(Fig. 20–50). A relay is an electromagnet (the iron rod inside
the coil does not move) which, when activated, attracts a
strip of iron on a pivot. Design a relay to close an electrical
switch. A relay is used when you need to switch on a circuit
carrying a very large current but do not want that large cur-
rent flowing through the main switch. For example, a car’s
starter switch is connected to a relay so that the large current
needed for the starter doesn’t pass to the dashboard switch.
