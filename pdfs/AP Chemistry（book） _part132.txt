Give It Some Thought
Hydrogen, oxygen, and water are all composed of molecules. What is it about a 
molecule of water that makes it a compound, whereas hydrogen and oxygen are 
elements?
The elements hydrogen and oxygen themselves exist naturally as diatomic (two-
atom) molecules:
Oxygen molecule
Hydrogen molecule
(written O2)
(written H2)

Distinguishing among Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures
“White gold” contains gold and a “white” metal, such as palladium. Two samples of white gold  
differ in the relative amounts of 
gold and palladium they contain. Both samples are uniform in composition throughout. Use F
