ond polarities, given 
nothing but the atoms involved in the bonds.
Plan Because we are not asked for quantitative answers, we can use 
the periodic table and our knowledge of electronegativity trends 
to answer the question.
Solve
(a) The chlorine atom is common to both bonds. Therefore,  
we just need to compare the electronegativities of B and C. 
Because boron is to the left of carbon in the periodic table, 
we predict that boron has the lower electronegativity.  
Chlorine, being on the right side of the table, has high elec-
tronegativity. The more polar bond will be the one between 
the atoms with the biggest differences in electronegativity. 
Consequently, the BÂ¬ Cl bond is more polar; the chlorine 
atom carries the partial negative charge because it has a 
higher electronegativity.
(b) In this example, phosphorus is common to both bonds, and 
so we just need to compare the electronegativities of F and 
Cl. Because fluorine is above chlorine in the periodic table, it 
should be
