Figure 24.24 The body is able to regulate temperature in response to signals from the nervous system.
When bacteria are destroyed by leukocytes, pyrogens are released into the blood. Pyrogens reset the body’s thermostat
to a higher temperature, resulting in fever. How do pyrogens cause body temperature to rise?
a.
Pyrogens circulate to the hypothalamus to reset the body’s “thermostat,” causing a rise in temperature.
b.
Pyrogens circulate to the thalamus to reset the body’s “thermostat,” causing a rise in temperature.
c.
Pyrogens cause an increase in the activity of the animal’s enzymes, which results in the temperature rise.
d.
Pyrogens entering the blood release some lipid substances, which ultimately cause the rise in temperature.
The hypothalamus maintains the
