in an excited state. Figure 6.12 shows the 
allowed energy levels for the hydrogen atom for several values of n.
Give It Some Thought
As the energy level of an orbit becomes more negative, does the electron 
experience a stronger or weaker attraction to the nucleus? Does the radius of the 
orbit increase or decrease?
Go Figure
If the transition of an electron from 
the n = 3 state to the n = 2 state 
results in emission of visible light, is 
the transition from the n = 2 state 
to the n = 1 state more likely to 
result in the emission of infrared or 
ultraviolet radiation?

▲ Figure 6.12 Energy levels in the 
hydrogen atom from the Bohr model.
The arrows refer to the transitions of the 
electron from one allowed energy state to 
another. The states shown are those for which 
n = 1 through n = 6 and the state for 
n = ∞ for which the energy, E, equals zero.
What happens as n becomes infinitely larg
