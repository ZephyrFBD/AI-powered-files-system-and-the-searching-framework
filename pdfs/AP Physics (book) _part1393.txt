 equal intervals. For temperatures
below the freezing point of water and above the boiling point of water, the scales
may be extended using the same equally spaced intervals. However, thermome-
ters can be used only over a limited temperature range because of their own
limitations—for example, an alcohol-in-glass thermometer is rendered useless above
temperatures where the alcohol vaporizes. For very low or very high temperatures,
specialized thermometers are required, some of which we will mention later.
Every temperature on the Celsius scale corresponds to a particular temperature
on the Fahrenheit scale, Fig. 13–7. To convert from one to the other, remember
that 0°C corresponds to 32°F and that a range of 100° on the Celsius scale corre-
sponds to a range of 180° on the Fahrenheit scale. Thus, one Fahrenheit degree (1 F°)
corresponds to 
of a Celsius degree (1 C°). That is,
(Notice that when we refer to a specific temperature, we say “degrees Celsius,”
as in 20°C; but when we refer
