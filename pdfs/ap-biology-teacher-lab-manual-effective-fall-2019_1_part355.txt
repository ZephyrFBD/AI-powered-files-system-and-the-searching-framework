will find myriad ideas for student questions and experimental designs. 
Figure 5 shows a sample light response curve as an example of the type of work 
students can do with this technique. The total time required was about one hour of 
laboratory work per student. The plant is deep shade English Ivy grown at 25Â° C, with

excess bicarbonate solution. All of the leaf disks came from a single leaf. The technique 
was modified by placing the infiltrated disks in petri dishes with 30 mL of bicarbonate 
solution each. This created a very shallow solution depth in which the leaf disks rose 
more quickly.
