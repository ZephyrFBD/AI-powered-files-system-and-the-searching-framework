8. There has been considerable interest in understanding the
behavior of cancer cells to improve treatments. One abnormality
that has been detected in certain types of cancer is activation of X
chromosomes that are normally inactive as Barr bodies. The table
below shows characteristics of diﬀerent cancer cell lines. “XIST”
refers to “X-inactive specific transcript,” which is important in X
chromosome inactivation. “Xi” refers to an inactive X
chromosome and “Xa” refers to an active X chromosome.
*HMEC represents normal human epithelial mammary cells, used as a control.
