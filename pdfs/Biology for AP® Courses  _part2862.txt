Think About It
How are negative feedback loops used to regulate body homeostasis? How is a condition such as diabetes a good
example of the failure of a set point in humans? Hypothesize and draw a diagram that shows what you think is the
feedback failure for a person with diabetes.
Homeostasis: Thermoregulation
Body temperature affects body activities. Generally, as body temperature rises, enzyme activity rises as well. For every ten
degree centigrade rise in temperature, enzyme activity doubles, up to a point. Body proteins, including enzymes, begin to
denature and lose their function with high heat (around 50oC for mammals). Enzyme activity will decrease by half for every
ten degree centigrade drop in temperature, to the point of freezing, with a few exceptions. Some fish can withstand freezing
solid and return to normal with thawing.
