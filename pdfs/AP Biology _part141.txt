I
Synapsis, the pairing of homologues, occurs.
Crossing-over, the exchange of homologous bits of chromosomes,
occurs.
Chiasmata, the visible manifestations of the crossover events, are
visible.
Prophase I sets the stage for separation (segregation) of DNA.
STUDY TIP
For details on spermatogenesis and oogenesis see pages 392 and 393.
METAPHASE I
The homologous pairs of chromosomes are lined up double file
along the metaphase plate.
Spindle fibers from the poles of the cell are attached to the
centromeres of each pair of homologues.
ANAPHASE I
There is a separation of homologous chromosomes as they are
pulled by spindle fibers and migrate to opposite poles.
TELOPHASE I
Homologous pairs continue to separate until they reach the poles of
the cell. Each pole has the haploid number of chromosomes.
CYTOKINESIS I
Cytokinesis usually occurs simultaneously with telophase I.
In some species, an interphase occurs between meiosis I and meiosis II.
In other species, this does not occur. In either ca
