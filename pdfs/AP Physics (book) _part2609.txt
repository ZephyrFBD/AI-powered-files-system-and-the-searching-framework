owed
between the lens and the sensor plane is 132 mm. (a) How
far in front of the sensor should the lens (assumed thin) be
positioned if the object to be photographed is 10.0 m away?
(b) 3.0 m away? (c) 1.0 m away? (d) What is the closest
object this lens could photograph sharply?
46. (II) Use ray diagrams to show that a real image formed by
a thin lens is always inverted, whereas a virtual image is
always upright if the object is real.
47. (II) A stamp collector uses a converging lens with focal
length 28 cm to view a stamp 16 cm in front of the lens.
(a)Where is the image located? (b) What is the magnification?
48. (II) It is desired to magnify reading material by a factor of
when a book is placed 9.0 cm behind a lens. (a) Draw
a ray diagram and describe the type of image this would
be. (b) What type of lens is needed? (c) What is the power
of the lens in diopters?
49. (II) A 
lens is held 12.5 cm from an ant 1.00 mm
high. Describe the position, type, and height of the image.
