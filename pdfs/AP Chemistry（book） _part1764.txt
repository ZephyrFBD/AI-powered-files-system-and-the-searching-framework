r to cook food 
at high elevations than it does at sea level. The atmospheric pressure is lower at higher 
altitudes, so water boils at a temperature lower than 100 °C, and foods generally take lon-
ger to cook.
Notice that the plots in Figure 11.25 have a distinct shape: For each 
substance, the vapor–pressure curves sharply upward with increasing 
temperature. The relationship between vapor pressure and tempera-
ture is given by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation:
 
ln P =
- ∆Hvap
RT
+ C 
[11.1]
where P is the vapor pressure, T is the absolute temperature, R is the 
gas constant 18.314 J>mol@K2, ∆Hvap is the molar enthalpy of vapor-
ization, and C is a constant. This equation predicts that a graph of ln 
P versus 1>T should give a straight line with a slope equal to ∆Hvap>R. 
Using this plot, we can determine the enthalpy of vaporization of a 
substance:
∆Hvap = -slope * R
As an example of how we use the Clausius–Clapeyron equa-
tion, the vapor–pressure data for ethanol shown in Figure
