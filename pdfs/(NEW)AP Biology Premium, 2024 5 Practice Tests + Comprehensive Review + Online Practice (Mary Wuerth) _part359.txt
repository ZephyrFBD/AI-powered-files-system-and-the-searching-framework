 need to use reverse transcriptase to make
a DNA copy of their genetic material. Therefore, eukaryotic cells do not contain reverse transcriptase. A
reverse transcriptase inhibitor would have few, if any, side effects on eukaryotic cells.
(c) Retroviruses would be expected to have a higher mutation rate than that of DNA viruses.
(d) One reason why a retrovirus would be expected to have a higher mutation rate than that of a DNA virus is
because retroviruses use reverse transcriptase to copy their genome. Reverse transcriptase is less accurate
and generates more mutations than DNA polymerase, which would lead to a higher mutation rate in
retroviruses.
12. (a) The function of ligase in DNA replication is to join the fragments created during replication of the lagging
strand in DNA.
(b) An appropriate control would be to conduct replication of the same DNA sequence without the presence of
the ligase inhibitor.
(c) The lagging strand of DNA would be most affected by a ligase inhibitor.
(d)
