We now look at the source of these potential changes and their relation to heart
activity.

FIGURE 17–37 Typical ECG.
Two heart beats are shown.
Both muscle and nerve cells have an electric dipole layer across the cell wall.
That is, in the normal situation there is a net positive charge on the exterior surface
and a net negative charge on the interior surface, Fig.17–38a. The amount of charge
depends on the size of the cell, but is approximately 
of surface. For a cell
whose surface area is 
the total charge on either s
