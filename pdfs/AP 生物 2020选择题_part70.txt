Sample 1 was collected from the woody stem of the plant. Sample 2 was collected from the root tip of the 
plant. Cells in different steps of mitosis are labeled with letters A, B, C, D, and E in Sample 2. 
Figure 1. Drawings of samples of plant cells collected from two locations in a woody plant during the spring 
(a) Describe the role of mitosis in the growth of a plant. 
(b) Explain why there are more cells observed in mitosis in the root tip than in the woody stem. 
(c) Refine the model in the space provided for your response by using the letters from four of the cell 
labels of Sample 2 to represent the sequential steps of mitosis. 
(d) Explain how the arrangement of cellular components during the step of mitosis portrayed by cell D in 
Sample 2 facilitates the proper dis
