4°C had the largest error bars and therefore the largest variability.
b. Reptiles in the study needed to have a gertimtonase reaction rate exceeding 10 mmol/s for an observed
improvement in water retention. Describe the range of temperatures that Russian tortoises could be raised in to
achieve this benefit.
Russian tortoises could be raised between 37°C and 30°C for gertimtonase to have the water retention effect.
c. Desert tortoises live in environments where the ground temperature can exceed 60°C. Using the data above,
predict and justify how the graph would look for desert tortoise gertimtonase.
The graph’s peak would shift to the higher temperatures. Because the tortoise has lived in the desert for many
years, its enzymes you would expect to be optimized for a higher temperature. Therefore, we would expect to see the
peak around 60°C with reaction rates dropping significantly at lower and higher temperatures.
d. Explain at a molecular level how the temperature change might affect g
