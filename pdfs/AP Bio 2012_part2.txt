able access a 
guiding principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically 
prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the 
elimination of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial 
and socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underserved. Schools 
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their 
student population. The College Board also believes that all students should have 
access to academically challenging course work before they enroll in AP classes, 
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to 
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
