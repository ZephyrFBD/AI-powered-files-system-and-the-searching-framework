(b) 12C and 14C, (c) lead-206 and thorium-230. Explain 
your choice in each case.
 21.23  Which of the following nuclides have magic numbers of 
both protons and neutrons: (a) helium-4, (b) oxygen-18, 
(c) calcium-40, (d) zinc-66, (e) lead-208?
 21.24  Despite the similarities in the chemical reactivity of ele-
ments in the lanthanide series, their abundances in Earth’s 
crust vary by two orders of magnitude. This graph shows 
the relative abundance as a function of atomic number. 
Which of the following statements best explains the saw-
tooth variation across the series?
(a) The elements with an odd atomic number lie above the 
belt of stability.
(b) The elements with an odd atomic number lie below 
the belt of stability.
(c) The elements with an even atomic number have a 
magic number of protons.
(d) Pairs of protons have a special stability.
