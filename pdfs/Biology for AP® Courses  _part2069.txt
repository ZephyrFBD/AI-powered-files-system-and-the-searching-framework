of moths vulnerable to predators changed to light.
Commonly used in biology textbooks, the peppered moth
is a classic example of evolutionary change in action. The
example describes changes in a populationâ€™s allele
frequencies-a small-scale change, evolutionarily speaking.
The presence of both light and dark forms within the gene
pool is demonstrated by the story, but the peppered moth
stays a peppered moth.
Which scenario, if it were to occur, would be a model for
large-scale evolutionary change?
a.
Conditions change such that the dark form of the
moth is favored and the light form is diminished
in the population due to predation. Conditions
change again, the dark form is vulnerable, and
the light form returns to prevalence.
b.
Conditions change such that the dark form of the
moth is favored and the light form is eradicated
in the population due to predation. Conditions
change again, the dark form is vulnerable, and
the dark form is eradicated due to predation.
c.
Condition
