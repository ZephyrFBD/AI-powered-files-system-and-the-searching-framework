Dosimetry
The strength of a source can be specified at a given time by stating the 
source activity: how many nuclear decays (or disintegrations) occur per second.
The traditional unit is the curie (Ci), defined as
(This number comes from the original definition as the activity of exactly one
gram of radium.) Although the curie is still in common use, the SI unit for source
activity is the becquerel (Bq), defined as
Commercial suppliers of radionuclides (radioactive nuclides) used as tracers spec-
ify the activity at a given time. Because the activity decreases over time, more so
for short-lived isotopes, it is important to take this decrease into account.
The magnitude of the source activity,
is related to the number of
radioactive nuclei present, N, and to the half-life,
by (see Section 30–8):
Radioactivity taken up by cells. In a certain experiment,
