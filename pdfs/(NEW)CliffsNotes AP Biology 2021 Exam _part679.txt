the moths roll
the pollen into a ball, carry it to another Yucca plant, and deposit it on the stigma of a flower. The moth also deposits
its eggs into some of the flower’s ovules, but only about a third of the flower’s seeds are eaten by the moth larvae
after hatching from the eggs. There are no other pollinators for Yucca and no other hosts for yucca moth egg-laying.
Red, tubular flowers with no odor have coevolved with hummingbirds, who are attracted to red and have long beaks
and little sense of smell. The flowers provide a copious amount of nectar in exchange for the transfer of their pollen
to other flowers.
Ecological Succession
Ecological succession is the change in the composition of species over time. The traditional view of succession
describes how one community with certain species is gradually and predictably replaced by another community
consisting of different species. As succession progresses, species diversity (the number of species in a community)
and total biomass (th
