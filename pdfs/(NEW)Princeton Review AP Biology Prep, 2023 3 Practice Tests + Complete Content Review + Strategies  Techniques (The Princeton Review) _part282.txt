cell appearance by microscopy or changes in detected DNA were determined to be phases of the cell cycle and are
labeled with the letters Aâ€“D.
2. Approximately how long does S phase take to occur in these cells?
(A) 15 min
(B) 20 min
(C) 30 min
(D) 40 min
3. During which of the labeled phases of the experiment would the cell undergo anaphase?
(A) Phase A
(B) Phase B
(C) Phase C
(D) Phase D
4. Trisomy 21, which results in Down syndrome, results from nondisjunction of chromosome 21 in humans.
Nondisjunction occurs when two homologous chromosomes, or two sister chromatids, do not separate. Which
of the following describes the mechanism of this defect?
(A) During DNA replication in S phase of the cell cycle, the two new strands do not separate.
(B) During mitosis, at the metaphase plate, non-sister chromatids do not separate.
(C) The mitotic spindle attaches to chiasmata rather than kinetochores.
(D) The same microtubule in the spindle attaches to both sister chromatids during meiosis II.
