tal development. In contrast, a DNA fingerprint is a snapshot of the DNA, the “raw” genetic material,
uninfluenced by gene regulation; it cannot distinguish identical twins.(Rare exceptions to this occur as a result of
somatic mutations, mutations in cells other than those that produce gametes. Somatic mutations originate from
mitotic errors during development and create cell lines within an individual that are genetically different.)
Some Typical Answers to Long Questions
Question 1
a. Genes are segments of the DNA that contain instructions for producing a specific polypeptide. Many polypeptides
are enzymes that regulate cellular reactions, which, in turn, produce chemical end products that appear as traits. The
process by which information is transferred from gene to enzyme is called protein synthesis. Transcription, the first
step in the process, describes how RNA is synthesized from DNA. RNA polymerase, in association with various
regulating transcription factors, attaches to DNA a
