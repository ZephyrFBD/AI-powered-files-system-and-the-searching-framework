9. Avian brood parasites lay their eggs in the nests of other birds so
that those other birds will incur the costs of raising their oﬀspring.
The figure below shows the results of a study of cuckoo parasitism
on ashy-throated parrotbills. The x-axis shows a contrast score
measuring the diﬀerence between the egg coloration of the host
and parasite, with higher numbers representing greater color
diﬀerence. The y-axis shows the percentage of parasite eggs
rejected by the hosts.
Which of the following conclusions is best supported by the data?

Action: Disruptive Selection on Egg Colour in an Avian
Brood Parasite and Its Host,” PLoS ONE 5, no. 5 (May

There is evolution occurring in the population, but it is
impossible to make specific predictions about the direction
that evolution is taking.

There is a stable situation in which closely-matching parasitic
eggs are most likely to be raised by the host, without
