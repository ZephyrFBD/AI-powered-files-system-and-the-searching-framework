group 4A elements (CH4 through SnH4, all nonpolar) increase systematically moving down 
the group. This is the expected trend because polarizability and, hence, dispersion forces 
generally increase as molecular weight increases. The heavier members of groups 5A, 6A, and 
7A follow the same trend, but NH3, H2O, and HF have boili
