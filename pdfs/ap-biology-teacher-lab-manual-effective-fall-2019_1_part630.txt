. Guaiacol, an indicator, is used to measure 
the amount of oxygen released in the reaction. As students work through the investigation, 
they acquire skills to explore their own questions about enzymatic activity. Questions 
raised might include How will different pH buffers or temperatures affect reaction rates? and 
Which has a greater effect on the rate of reaction: changing the concentration of enzyme or the 
concentration of substrate? The investigation also provides students an opportunity to apply 
and review concepts they have studied previously, such as energy transfer, the levels of 
protein structure, and the role of enzymes in maintaining homeostasis.

â– BACKGROUND
Almost all life on this planet is powered, either directly or indirectly, by sunlight. Energy 
captured from sunlight drives the production of energy-rich organic compounds 
during the process of photosynthesis. These organic compounds create biomass. Gross
