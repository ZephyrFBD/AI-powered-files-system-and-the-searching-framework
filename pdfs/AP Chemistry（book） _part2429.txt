1 molar mixture of H2 and N2.
If a system at equilibrium is disturbed by a change in concentration, pressure, or temperature,
the system will shift its equilibrium position so as to counter the effect of the disturbance.
Le Châtelier’s Principle
Concentration: adding or removing a reactant or product
If a substance is added to a system at equilibrium, the system reacts to consume some of the substance.  If a substance is removed
from a system,
