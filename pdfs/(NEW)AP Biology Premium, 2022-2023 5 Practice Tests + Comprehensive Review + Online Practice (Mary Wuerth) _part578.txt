quations apply:
where p represents the frequency of the dominant allele in the gene pool of the population and q represents the
frequency of the recessive allele in the population. p2 represents the frequency of the homozygous dominant
genotype, 2pq represents the frequency of the heterozygous genotype, and q2 represents the frequency of the
homozygous recessive genotype.
One way to study Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is to build a spreadsheet to model how a gene pool would change
in a hypothetical population from one generation to the next. Another way to study this would be to use one of the
widely available computer simulations online. Adjusting the parameters of a spreadsheet or online simulation allows
for the exploration of the effects of selection, mutation, migration, genetic drift, or heterozygote advantage on allele
frequencies in the gene pool of a population.
