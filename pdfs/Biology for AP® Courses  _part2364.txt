ears and reactivate in adults to cause the painful condition known as “shingles” (Figure 21.11ab).
Figure 21.11 (a) Varicella-zoster, the virus that causes chickenpox, has an enveloped icosahedral capsid visible in this
transmission electron micrograph. Its double-stranded DNA genome becomes incorporated in the host DNA and can
reactivate after latency in the form of (b) shingles, often exhibiting a rash. (credit a: modification of work by Dr. Erskine

inhibit cell growth. Oncogenic viruses can
