ava has separated the population into two 
areas: an upland forest and a lowland marsh. 
(C) Multiple groups of birds depend on the fruit 
produced by the plants as a source of food. 
(D) The plants produce more seeds during warm 
summers than they do during cool summers. 
 
12. Individuals with an inherited autosomal recessive 
disorder called primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) 
often have severe respiratory problems due to 
defective cilia. Males with PCD are often sterile 
because they produce sperm with defective 
flagella. Which of the following most likely 
explains the effect of the recessive allele? 
(A) The mitochondria are defective and do not 
produce sufficient protein to synthesize 
microtubules in the cilia and flagella.  
(B) The plasma membrane of the alveoli is  
not permeable to carbon dioxide during 
respiration because it is too hydrophobic. 
(C) The Golgi bodies secrete an enzyme that 
destroys the proteins in the flagella and 
cilia.  
(D) The cells do not produce f
