A biologist wants to determine whether a new protocol
is successful in constructing and amplifying a molecular
clone of a segment of DNA introduced as a plasmid. After
the procedure is complete, the bacterial cells containing
the plasmid with the inserted segment are lysed, and a gel
is run into which samples of the lysate and the sequences
to be cloned have been pipetted. Use the data displayed in
the developed gel shown below to evaluate the question
of whether the protocol was successful.

C. Design a plan to answer the question of whether the
new DNA has been incorporated into the DNA of the host
organism.
52. Genetic engineering can be applied to heritable
information to produce what is referred to as a
“knockdown organism.” Biotechnology also can be
applied to produce nonheritable changes in a “knockdown
gene.” Post-transcriptional strategies target the mRNA
product of a gene. One such strategy uses the conserved
genes that
