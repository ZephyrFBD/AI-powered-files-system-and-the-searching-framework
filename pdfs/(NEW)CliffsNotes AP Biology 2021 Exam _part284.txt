orn, they may experience slightly difference environments in the uterus, and these differences lead to
different phenotypic expressions of height, weight, and fingerprints. Some examples of environmental factors that
influence gene expression follow:
Nutrition can heavily influence physical development in both animals and plants. Insufficient calcium or other
dietary deficiencies may result in short stature, while plants growing in soils that lack adequate amounts of nitrogen
may not flower or may flower and produce smaller than normal fruits.
Nutrition may also influence the expression of genetic disorders. For example, individuals with phenylketonuria
cannot metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. As a result, phenylalanine accumulates, brain cells die, and death
follows. However, if dietary phenylalanine is reduced to minimal levels, quantities of phenylalanine in the body
remain safe. Similarly, individuals who are lactose intolerant and unable to break down lactose can avoid symp
