ritical value with 2 degrees of freedom and a 
significance level of .05. While there are 3 phenotypes, this Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium question involves only 2 alleles, and the 
frequency of 1 allele determines the frequency of the other allele. 
Therefore, there is a single independent variable and 1 degree of 
freedom.
(C) 
Incorrect. This is the critical value with 3 degrees of freedom and a 
significance level of .05.
(D) 
Incorrect. This is the critical value with 4 degrees of freedom and a 
significance level of .05.
