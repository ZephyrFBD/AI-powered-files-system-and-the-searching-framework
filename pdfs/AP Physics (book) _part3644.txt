 called up, down, strange, charm, bottom,
and top. It is expected that there are the same number of
quarks as leptons (six of each), and that quarks and leptons are
truly fundamental particles along with the gauge bosons 
(
W, Z, gluons) and the Higgs boson.
Quarks are said to have color, and, according to quantum
chromodynamics (QCD), the strong color force acts between
their color charges and is transmitted by gluons. Electroweak
theory views the weak and electromagnetic forces as two
aspects of a single underlying interaction. QCD plus the elec-
troweak theory are referred to as the Standard Model of the
fundamental particles.
Grand unified theories of forces suggest that at very short
distance 
and very high energy, the weak, electro-
magnetic, and strong forces would appear as a single force, and
the fundamental difference between quarks and leptons would
disappear.
According to string theory, the fundamental particles may
be tiny strings,
long, distinguished by their standing
