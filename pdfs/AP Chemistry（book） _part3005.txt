ange in the surroundings. But what kind of change occurs?
Piston
Vacuum
Gas
Movable partition
Irreversible expansion of gas
Work done by system = 0
Compression
Work done on system > 0
Work
If the partition is removed, 
the gas spontaneously fills 
the evacuated space.
Surroundings do work on the 
system to move the piston 
and thus compress the gas.
▲ Figure 19.4 An irreversible process. Initially, an ideal gas is confined to the right half of a  
cylinder. When the partition is removed, the gas spontaneously expands to fill the whole cylinder.  
No work is done by the system during this expansion. Using the piston to compress the gas back to  
its original state requires the surroundings to do work on the system.

CHAPTER 19 Chemical Thermodynamics
Recall that the first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved. In math-
ematical terms, ∆E = q + w 
; that is, the change in internal energy of a system is equal to 
the heat ab
