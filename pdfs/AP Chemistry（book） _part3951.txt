t is the one 
you should use; a “negative concentration” has no physical meaning.
Find the values of x that satisfy the equation 2x2 + 4x = 1.
SOLUTION
To solve the given equation for x, we must first put it in the form
ax2 + bx + c = 0
and then use the quadratic formula. If
2x2 + 4x = 1
then
2x2 + 4x - 1 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, where a = 2, b = 4, and c = -1, we 
have
 
x =
-4 { 242 - 41221-12
2122
 = -4 { 216 + 8
4
= -4 { 224
4
= -4 { 4.899
4
The two solutions are
x = 0.899
4
= 0.225 and x = -8.899
4
= -2.225
If this was a problem in which x represented a concentration, we 
would say x = 0.225 (in the appropriate units), since a negative 
number for concentration has no physical meaning.

Often the clearest way to represent the interrelationship between two variables is 
to graph them. Usually, the variable that is being experimentally varied, called the 
independent variable, is shown along the horizontal axis (x-ax
