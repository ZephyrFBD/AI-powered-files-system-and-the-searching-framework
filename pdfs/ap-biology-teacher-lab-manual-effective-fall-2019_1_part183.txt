r own regarding hairs or some other variable quantitative trait, such as 
plant height, stem color, or flower number. For instance, in a closely related plant, one 
investigation demonstrated that herbivore damage early in the plant’s development led to 
increased trichome numbers in later leaves. Could herbivore damage influence the hairy 
trait expression? 
Several hypotheses have been proposed as a possible explanation for the role that 
trichomes play. One hypothesis is that trichomes provide a degree of protection from 
herbivores — either by discouraging herbivores, such as insect larvae, or by discouraging 
egg laying. A common herbivore that feeds on Fast Plants is the cabbage white butterfly. 
Students could choose a question related to the trichomes and their importance to a 
plant, such as one that explores the relationship between herbivory and hair production, 
or they could choose a different trait and design and carry out an investigation to answer 
a question related to
