ion and adds nucleotides only
in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The leading strand is
synthesized in the direction away from the
replication fork. Replication on the lagging
strand occurs in the direction of the replication
fork in short stretches of DNA called Okazaki
fragments.

DNA polymerase reads the template strand in
the 5’ to 3’ direction and adds nucleotides only
in the 3’ to 5’ direction. The leading strand is
synthesized in the direction of the replication
fork. Replication on the lagging strand occurs in
the direction away from the replication fork in
long stretches of DNA called Okazaki
fragments.

DNA replication takes place in a semiconservative
fashion.

Meselson and Stahl experimented with E. coli.
DNA grown in 15 N was heavier than DNA
grown in 14 N . When DNA in 15 N was
switched to 14 N media, D
