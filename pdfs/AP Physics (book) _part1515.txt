From Table 14–1, the specific
heat of iron is 
The change in temperature is 
Thus,
(b) Our system is the vat plus the water. The water alone would require
or almost 10 times what an equal mass of iron requires. The total, for the vat
plus the water, is
NOTE In (b), the iron vat and the water underwent the same temperature
change,
but their specific heats are different.
¢T = 80 C°,
720 kJ + 6700 kJ = 7400 kJ.
Qw = mc ¢T = (20 kg)(4186 JkgC°)(80 C°) = 6.7 * 106 J = 6700 kJ,
Qvat = mc ¢T = (20 kg)(450 JkgC°)(80 C°) = 7.2 * 105 J = 720 kJ.
80 C°.
(90°C - 10°C) =
450 JkgC°.
EXAMPLE 14;2
14–3 Specific Heat
If heat flows into an object, the object’s temperature rises (assuming no phase
change). But how much does the temperature rise? That depends. As early as the
eighteenth century, experimenters had recognized that the amount of heat Q
required to change the temperature of a given material is proportional to the mass m
of the material present and to the temperature change
