already bound by antibodies. Binding
of complement proteins occurs in a specific and highly regulated sequence, with each successive protein being activated
by cleavage and/or structural changes induced upon binding of the preceding protein(s). After the first few complement
proteins bind, a cascade of sequential binding events follows in which the pathogen rapidly becomes coated in complement
proteins.
Complement proteins perform several functions. The proteins serve as a marker to indicate the presence of a pathogen to
phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and B cells, and enhance engulfment; this process is called opsonization. Certain
complement proteins can combine to form attack complexes that open pores in microbial cell membranes. These structures
destroy pathogens by causing their contents to leak, as illustrated in Figure 33.7.
