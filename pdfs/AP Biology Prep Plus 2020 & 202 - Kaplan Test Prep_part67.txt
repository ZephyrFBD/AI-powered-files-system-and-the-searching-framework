m the harsh
environment, while bacteria use their flagella to transport
themselves to pockets of water with higher pH.
(B)
The protozoa were forced to evolve at a more rapid rate than
their bacterial counterparts to adapt to the low pH in the
river.
(C)
Some organisms are able to generate ATP via chemiosmosis,
while others are limited to what they can create through
glycolysis.
(D)
11. Cellulose and starch both have the same empirical formula.
However, an alteration in the location of their linkages between
monomers causes them to have completely diﬀerent functions.
Which of the following best explains the diﬀerences between
these two molecules?
Starch is hard to digest, while cellulose is easy to digest.
(A)
Starch is used for energy storage, while cellulose is used for
structural support.
(B)
Starch is broken down into glucose, while cellulose is broken
down into fructose.
(C)
Starch has 1-4 glycosidic linkages of beta glucose monomers,
while cellulose has 1-4 glycosidic linkages of
