NOTE These voltages do not add up to the source voltage, 90.0 V (rms). Indeed,
the rms voltage across the inductance exceeds the source voltage. This can happen
because the different voltages are out of phase with each other: so, at any instant
the capacitor’s voltage might be negative which compensates for a large positive
inductor voltage. The rms voltages, however, are always positive by definition.
Although the rms voltages need not add up to the source voltage, the instantaneous
voltages at any time must add up to the source voltage at that instant.
