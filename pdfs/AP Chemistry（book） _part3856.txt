Notice that the chemical formula generally has the group originating from the acid writ-
ten first, which is opposite of the way the ester is named. Another example is isoamyl ace-
tate, the ester formed from acetic acid and isoamyl alcohol. Isoamyl acetate smells like 
bananas or pears.

Many esters such as isoamyl acetate have pleasant odors and are largely responsible 
for the pleasing aromas of fruit.
An ester treated with an acid or a base in aqueous solution is hydrolyzed; that is, the 
molecule is split into an alcohol and a carboxylic acid or its anion:

CHAPTER 24 The Chemistry of Life: Organic and Biological Chemistry
The hydrolysis of an ester in the presence of a base is called saponification, a term 
that comes from the Latin word for soap
