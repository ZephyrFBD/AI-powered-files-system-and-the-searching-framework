 blocked CDK
Questions 30–34
Which of the following statements explains why a cell with damaged DNA
aﬀects CDKs’ activity?
The damaged DNA in cells in G1 phase will trigger a response from
CDK inhibitors such as p53 to repair the damaged DNA before the
cells progress to G2 phase.
(A)
The damaged DNA in cells in G1 phase will trigger a response from
CDK inhibitors such as p53 to repair the damaged DNA before the
cells progress to S phase.
(B)
The damaged DNA in cells in G2 phase will trigger a response from
CDK inhibitors such as p53 to repair the damaged DNA before the
cells progress to G1 phase.
(C)
The damaged DNA in cells in G2 phase will trigger a response from
CDK inhibitors such as p53 to repair the damaged DNA before the
cells progress to S phase.
(D)
29. Why would clumps of overlapping mammalian cells indicate a problem
with cell cycle regulation?
Normal cells use cyclin-dependent kinases for regulation.
(A)
Normal cell division is stimulated by active anaphase-promoting
comple
