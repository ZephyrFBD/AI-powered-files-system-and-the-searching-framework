The RNA world hypothesis proposes that RNA was the precursor to
forms of life on Earth. Ribozymes provide evidence that there are
strands of RNA molecules that have functions similar to catalytic
enzymes. The fact that they are able to self-replicate short strands of
complementary RNA (as long as they are supplied with nucleotides)
indicates that ribozymes were a primitive form of enzymes that could
both store genetic material and catalyze chemical reactions before the
evolution of DNA. (C) is thus correct. (A) and (B) are incorrect because
they only take into account how the organic molecules (nucleotide
building blocks) needed by ribozymes are made; they do not however
explain how the ribozymes relate to the origin of all life on Earth. (D) is
incorrect because it mentions amino acids, which are not the buil
