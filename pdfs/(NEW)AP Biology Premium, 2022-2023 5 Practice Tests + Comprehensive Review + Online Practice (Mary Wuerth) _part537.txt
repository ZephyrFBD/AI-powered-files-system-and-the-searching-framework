thesis (also known as the light-
independent cycle). Plants thought to have evolved in tropical climates use an additional step referred to as C4
photosynthesis. Scientists measured the photosynthetic rate of C3 plants (sugar beets) and C4 plants
(sugarcane) in a sealed container under three different temperature conditions. Data are shown in the table.

(a) Explain why the rate of carbon dioxide consumption was used in this experiment.
(b) Construct a graph of the data, showing 95% confidence intervals.
(c) Analyze the data, and determine at which temperature(s) there was a statistically significant difference in
carbon dioxide consumption in C3 and C4 plants.
(d) Coleus is a popular C3 houseplant. A person has a Coleus plant inside her climate-controlled home, in
which the temperat
