hotosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide and produces oxygen. Aerobic respiration consumes oxygen
and produces carbon dioxide. These two processes play an important role in the carbon cycle. (credit: modification of

Photosynthesis and aerobic respiration are interrelated in important ways. During photosynthesis, plants
take in carbon dioxide and water. The water molecule is split, the oxygen is released into the atmosphere,
and the carbon dioxide is used to build carbohydrates. During aerobic respiration, organisms take in water
and oxygen for respiration and produce carbon dioxide.
The Earth did not contain oxygen in its atmosphere throughout much of its history, even after life on Earth had already
began. It did, however, contain carbon dioxide. What does this suggest about when photosynthetic organisms evolved,
relative to non-photosynthetic organisms, and why?
a.
Photosynthetic organisms evolved before non-photosynthetic organisms because no oxygen was present i
