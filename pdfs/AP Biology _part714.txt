elease hormones that travel long distances
through the blood to reach all parts of the body. Tropic hormones
send a signal to other glands to release another hormone.
There are two types of hormones: lipid or steroid hormones and
protein hormones.
Lipid hormones can readily diffuse through the target cell
membrane, binding to a receptor inside the cell to alter the
expression of a gene and trigger a cellular response.
Protein hormones must bind to a cell surface receptor, triggering
a cellular response via a secondary messenger inside the cell.
Neurons release neurotransmitters into a synapse to cause a local
response in a neuron, gland, or muscle.
