to the RNA is controlled by phosphorylation. If eIF-2 is phosphorylated, it
undergoes a conformational change and cannot bind to GTP. Therefore, the initiation complex cannot form properly and
translation is impeded (Figure 16.14). When eIF-2 remains unphosphorylated, it binds the RNA and actively translates the
protein.
Figure 16.14 Gene expression can be controlled by factors that bind the translation initiation complex.
An increase in phosphorylation levels of eIF-2 has been observed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s. What impact do you think this might have on protein synthesis?
a.
It will increase the rate of translation.
b.
It will not affect the translation process.
c.
It will block the translation of certain proteins.
d.
It will produce multiple fragments of polypeptides.
