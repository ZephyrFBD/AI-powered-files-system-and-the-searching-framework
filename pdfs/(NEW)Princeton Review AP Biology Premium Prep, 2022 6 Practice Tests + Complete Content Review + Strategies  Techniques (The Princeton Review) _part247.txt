ber the major steps of cell respiration, and the outcome of each step:
Photosynthesis vs. Cell Respiration
The photosynthesis reactions share some similarities with cell respiration. In both cases, ATP production is driven
by a proton gradient, and the proton gradient is created by an electron transport chain. In respiration, protons are
pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, and they return to the matrix through an ATP
synthase down their concentration gradient. In photosynthesis, protons are pumped from the stroma into the
thylakoids compartment, and they return to the stroma through an ATP synthase down their concentration gradient.
The Krebs cycle and the Calvin cycle are both series of reactions that ultimately regenerate their starting product.
Both cycles have an indirect need for a particular substance; although they do not use it directly, without it they
cease to run. For the Krebs cycle, that substance is oxygen; for the Calvin cycle, that â€œsubstanc
