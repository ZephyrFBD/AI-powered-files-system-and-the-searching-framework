ew 2 shows a RBC in 
an isotonic environment because it would shrink in a hypertonic solution and 
swell in a hypotonic solution.
(D)
This option is incorrect because the sodium potassium pump actually pumps  
out more sodium than potassium, which would make the internal environment  
of the RBC hypotonic and thus lose water and shrink, not gain water and swell.  
In addition, sodium potassium pumps do not play a role in osmosis across  
cell membranes.

Question 24
Essential Knowledge
2.A.1: All living systems require constant input of  
free energy.
Science Practice
6.1: The student can justify claims with evidence.
Learning Objective 
2.2: The student is able to justify a scientific claim that 
free energy is required for living systems to maintain 
organization, to grow, or to reproduce, but that multiple 
strategies exist in different living systems.
(A)
This option is incorrect despite being a correct statement. These strategies help 
the different organisms to survive
