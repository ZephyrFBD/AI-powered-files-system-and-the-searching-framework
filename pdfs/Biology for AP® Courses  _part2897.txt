cium control is an example of a
negative feedback loop.
a.
Cells in parathyroid gland sense calcium
decrease causing parathyroid hormone release
and stimulating calcium absorption. Bone may
also break down to release calcium.
b.
Cells in parathyroid gland sense calcium
decrease causing calcitonin release and
stimulating calcium absorption. Bone may also
break down to release calcium.
c.
Cells in thyroid gland sense calcium decrease
causing calcitonin release and stimulating
calcium absorption. Bone may also break down
to release calcium.
d.
Cells in parathyroid gland sense calcium
increase causing parathyroid hormone release
and stimulating calcium absorption. Bone may
also break down to release calcium.
48. In organisms, homeostasis of various bodily processes,
such as body temperature, blood glucose levels, and blood
calcium levels, is essential for the maintenance of proper
body functions. What role does insulin play in
homeostasis?
