ers of photosynthetic cyanobacteria.
Pose a scientific question that guides inquiry into early
Earth conditions that supported the innovation of
photosynthesis.
75. Connect the techniques of radiometric measurement,
anatomy, and molecular biology to the supporting
evidence of the theory of evolution provided.
76. Describe reasons for the revision of scientific
hypotheses of the origin of life on Earth.
77. Directed evolution is an inquiry strategy that is usually
used to investigate gene expression or the function of
proteins that are expressed. The investigator imposes a
selection pressure and observes the evolution of a
population. In one investigation, unicellular yeast were
allowed to sediment in a column of a nutrient-containing
solution. Individuals that traveled furthest towards the
bottom of the column were removed and placed in a new
column. After 60 generations of repeated selection, yeast
became multicellular. In this experiment, selection was
acting on the collection of cel
