ng enzyme that 
hydrolyzes GFP* at alkaline pH,  
preventing fluorescence. 
(C) An influx of protons into the axon terminal 
activates synthesis of new GFP* molecules, 
preventing fluorescence. 
(D) Packaging of GFP* into synaptic vesicles is 
triggered by a sudden drop in cytosolic pH, 
preventing fluorescence.

45. Which of the following observations best supports
the hypothesis that CDK5 negatively regulates
neurotransmitter release?
(A) Introduction of CDK5 protein into neurons
results in the movement of synaptic vesicles 
to the plasma membrane in the absence of 
any stimulus. 
(B) Uptake of a gene encoding CDK5 by neurons 
results in the movement of synaptic vesicles 
to the plasma membrane in the absence of 
any stimulus. 
(C) Suppression of CDK5 expression in neurons 
inhibits the movement of synaptic vesicles 
to the plasma membrane in response to a 
specific stimulus. 
(D) Inhi
