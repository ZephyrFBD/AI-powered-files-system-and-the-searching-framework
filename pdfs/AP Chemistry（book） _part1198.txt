 following table that there is a signiﬁcant in-
crease in atomic radius upon moving from Y to La, whereas 
the radii of Zr to Hf are the same. Suggest an explanation for 
this effect.

 [7.89]  (a) Which ion is smaller, Co3+ or Co4+? (b) In a lithium-ion 
battery that is discharging to power a device, for every Li+ 
that inserts into the lithium cobalt oxide electrode, a Co4+ 
ion must be reduced to a Co3+ ion to balance charge. Using

the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics or other standard 
reference, ﬁnd the ionic radii of Li+, Co3+, and Co4+. Order 
these ions from smallest to largest. (c) Will the lithium co-
balt oxide cathode expand or contract as lithium ions are 
inserted? (d) Lithium is not nearly as abundant as sodium. 
If sodium ion batteries were developed that function in the 
same manner as lithium ion batteries, do you think “sodi-
um cobalt oxide” would still work as the elect
