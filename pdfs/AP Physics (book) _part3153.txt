when a photon is emitted or
absorbed, transitions can occur only between states with values of that differ by
exactly one unit:
According to this selection rule, an electron in an 
state can jump only to a
state with
or 
It cannot jump to a state with
or
A tran-
sition such as 
to 
is called a forbidden transition. Actually, such a
transition is not absolutely forbidden and can occur, but only with very low
probability compared to allowed transitions—those that satisfy the selection rule
Since the orbital angular momentum of an H atom must change by
one unit when it emits a photon, conservation of angular momentum tells us that
the photon must carry off angular momentum. Indeed, experimental evidence of
many sorts shows that the photon can be assigned a spin angular momentum of 1U.
