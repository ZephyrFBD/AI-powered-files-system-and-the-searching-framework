is lower and the wavelength longer. The Doppler effect
occurs also for light, but the formula for light is slightly different than for sound
and is given by†
(33;3)
where 
is the emitted wavelength as seen in a reference frame at rest with
respect to the source, and 
is the wavelength observed in a frame moving with
velocity 
away from the source along the line of sight. (For relative motion
toward each other,
in this formula.) When a distant source emits light of
a particular wavelength, and the source is moving away from us, the wavelength
appears longer to us: the color of the light (if it is visible) is shifted toward the red
end of the visible spectrum, an effect known as a redshift. (If the source moves
toward us, the color shifts toward the blue or shorter wavelength.)
In the spectra of stars in other galaxies, lines are observed that correspond to
lines in the known spectra of particular atoms (see Section 27–11 and Figs. 24–28
and 27–23). What Hubble found was that the lines s
