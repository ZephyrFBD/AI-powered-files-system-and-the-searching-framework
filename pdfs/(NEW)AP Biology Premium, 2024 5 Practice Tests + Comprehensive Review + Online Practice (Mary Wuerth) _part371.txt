ermination of Translation
Flow of Information from the Nucleus to the Cell Membrane
DNA and RNA are the carriers of genetic information in organisms. In most organisms, genetic information starts
with DNA, which provides the information for the transcription of mRNA. mRNA then provides the information for
the sequence of amino acids in a protein.
In eukaryotes, genetic information in DNA is transcribed into mRNA in the nucleus. Ribosomes on the rough
endoplasmic reticulum use the information in mRNA to translate proteins. After the protein is translated, a vesicle
containing the protein will bud off from the rough endoplasmic reticulum and travel to the Golgi. At the Golgi, the
proteins will be modified and packaged into vesicles for export from the cell. These vesicles will bud off from the
Golgi and travel to the cell membrane. The vesicles then fuse with the cell membrane and release their protein
contents from the cell. So the flow of genetic information in a eukaryotic cell is as
