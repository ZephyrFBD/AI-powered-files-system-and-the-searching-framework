en if compressible.
Gases are very compressible, and density can vary significantly with depth.
For this more general case, in which 
may vary, we need to use Eq. 10–3b where
should be small if 
varies significantly with depth (or height).

Pressure at a faucet. The surface of the water in a storage
tank is 30 m above a water faucet in the kitchen of a house, Fig. 10–4. Calcu-
late the difference in water pressure between the faucet and the surface of the
water in the tank.
APPROACH Water is practically incompressible, so 
is constant even for a
when used in Eq. 10–3b. Only 
matters; we can ignore the
“route” of the pipe and its bends.
SOLUTION We assume the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the water in
the storage tank is the same as at the faucet. So, the water pressure difference
between the faucet and the surface of the water in the tank is
