ctions and produces organelles, proteins, and enzymes. For
example, during G1, the cell produces all of the enzymes required for DNA replication (DNA helicase, DNA
polymerase, and DNA ligase, which are explained later in this chapter). By the way, G stands for “gap,” but we can
also associate it with “growth.” These three phases are highly regulated by checkpoints and special proteins called
cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).
Cell cycle checkpoints are control mechanisms that make sure cell division is happening properly in eukaryotic
cells. They monitor the cell to make sure it is ready to progress through the cell cycle and stop progression if it is
not. In eukaryotes, checkpoint pathways function mainly at phase boundaries (such as the G1/S transition and the
G2/M transition). Checkpoint pathways are an example of an important cell signaling pathway inside cells.
For example, if the DNA genome has been damaged in some way, the cell should not divide. If it does, damaged
