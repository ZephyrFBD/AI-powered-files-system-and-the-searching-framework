ssue PCO2 = 45 mm Hg. The pressure gradient drives CO2 out of tissue cells and into the capillaries.
The blood returning to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries has a venous PO2 = 40 mm Hg and a PCO2 = 45 mm Hg.
The blood enters the lung capillaries where the process of exchanging gases between the capillaries and alveoli begins again

Figure 30.13 The partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide change as blood moves through the body.
How do PO2 and PCO2 change as blood passes from the arteries to the veins within body tissues?
a.
PO2 drops and PCO2 drops.
b.
PO2 increases and PCO2 decreases.
c.
PO2 increases and PCO2 increases.
d.
PO2 drops and PCO2 increases.
In short, the change in partial pressure from the alveoli to the capillaries drives the oxygen into the tissues and the carbon
dioxide into the blood from the tissues. The blood is then t
