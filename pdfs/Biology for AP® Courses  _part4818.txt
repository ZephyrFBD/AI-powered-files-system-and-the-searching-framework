 sustainability. Fisheries’ ability to provide protein to human populations is
threatened when extinction occurs.
Biodiversity may provide important psychological benefits to humans. Additionally, there are moral arguments for the
maintenance of biodiversity.
38.3 Threats to Biodiversity
The core threats to biodiversity are human population growth and unsustainable resource use. To date, the most significant
causes of extinctions are habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and overharvesting. Climate change is predicted to be
a significant cause of extinctions in the coming century. Habitat loss occurs through deforestation, damming of rivers, and
other activities. Overharvesting is a threat particularly to aquatic species, while the taking of bush meat in the humid
tropics threatens many species in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Exotic species have been the cause of a number of
extinctions and are especially damaging to islands and lakes. Exotic species’ introductions are incre
