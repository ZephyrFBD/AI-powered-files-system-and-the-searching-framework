and 
each undergoes a centripetal 
acceleration. What keeps the Moon
and the space shuttle (and its 
astronauts) from moving off in a
straight line away from Earth? It is
the force of gravity. Newton’s law of
universal gravitation states that all
objects attract all other objects with
a force that depends on their masses
and the square of the distance
between them.
In this Chapter, we study the circular motion of objects, and how Newton’s
laws of motion apply. We also discuss how Newton conceived of another great law
by applying the concepts of circular motion to the motion of the Moon and the
planets. This is the law of universal gravitation, which was the capstone of Newton’s
analysis of the physical world.
5–1 Kinematics of 
Uniform Circular Motion
An object that moves in a circle at constant speed v is said to experience 
uniform circular motion. The magnitude of the velocity remains constant in this
case, but the direction of the velocity continuously changes as the object moves
a
