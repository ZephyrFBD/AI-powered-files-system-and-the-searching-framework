os Islands.
They made their observations on Daphne Major—one of the most desolate
of the Galápagos Islands. It is an uninhabited volcanic cone where only
low to the ground cacti and shrubs grow. During 1977, there was a severe
drought and seeds of all kinds became scarce. The small, soft seeds were
quickly eaten by the birds, leaving mainly large, tough seeds that the
finches normally ignore. The year after the drought, the Grants discovered
that the average width of the finches’ beaks had increased.
Which of the following statements best explains the increase in beak
size?
Finches with bigger and stronger beaks were able to attack and
kill the finches with smaller beaks.
Finches with bigger beaks were larger animals with stronger
wings that could fly to other islands and gather a wide variety
of seeds.
During the drought, the finches’ beaks grew larger to
accommodate the need to eat tougher seeds.
