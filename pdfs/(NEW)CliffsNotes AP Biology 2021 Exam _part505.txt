t of the cells, relaxing the guard cells and allowing the
closure of the stoma.
5. C. The plant hormone ethylene is a gas that promotes ripening of many fruits. Fruit is often picked green
(unripened) and artificially ripened with ethylene before it is delivered to markets.
6. B. Although auxin is produced at the apical meristem (the tip of the shoot), it does not move down the stem by
diffusion, but rather by active transport, as indicated in choice D.
7. A. Mycorrhizae are fungi that form a mutualistic relationship with most plant roots. The filaments of the fungus
increase the root’s absorptive surface area for water and nutrients. The fungus receives carbohydrates from the plant.
The cuticle and stomata don’t increase surface area and occur only in above ground parts where gas exchange
occurs.
8. C. Phloem cells transport sugars and other organic materials; their density does not influence transpiration. Many
plants in hot climates have smaller leaves with thicker cuticles to reduc
