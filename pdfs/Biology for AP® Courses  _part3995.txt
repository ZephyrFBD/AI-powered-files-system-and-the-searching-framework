CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
29. Why does the human body need more than its skin to
function as a barrier to infecting pathogens?
a.
Skin works only against some types of bacteria.
To prevent the entry of other pathogens, other
physical or chemical barriers are needed.
b.
Skin does not provide a broad coverage against
invasion of the body by any foreign particle, so
it is not a very effective barrier.
c.
Pathogens could enter the body through several
places that are not covered by skin that need to
have a barrier to prevent infection.
d.
Skin acts only as a chemical barrier against
pathogens. The body also needs physical barriers
to prevent various types of infection.
30. Cell surface recognition occurs during many types of
immune responses, including immediate and induced
immune responses. How do natural killer cells and
interferons represent one of each type of immune response
(immediate and induced), and how does cell surface
recognition play a role?
