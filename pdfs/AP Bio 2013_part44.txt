 from a 
foreign source to produce protein. 
(C) In comparison with other cells, nerve cells 
have a superior ability to produce 
cytoskeletal proteins. 
(D) Muscle cells produce more b-hemoglobin 
than do cells from the other tissues in a 
tadpole. 
 
29. Which of the following is the best justification for 
why the rabbit hemoglobin proteins were found 
throughout the tadpole? 
(A) Rabbit mRNA is composed of nucleotides 
that are more stable than those in frog 
mRNA. 
(B) Rabbit hemoglobin is synthesized more 
efficiently than frog hemoglobin in frog 
cells. 
(C) After differentiation, the rabbit hemoglobin 
proteins move through the circulatory 
system of the tadpole to every cell. 
(D) The mRNA injected into the newly fertilized 
frog eggs is distributed in the cytoplasm of 
every daughter cell during cell division. 
 
30. Which of the following conclusions is most 
consistent with the results of the experiment? 
(A) Rabbit mRNA is composed of nucleotides 
that are absent from frog
