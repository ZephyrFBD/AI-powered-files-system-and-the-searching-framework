ame principle as a galvanometer (a torque is exerted on a
current-carrying loop in a magnetic field) except that the coil must turn continu-
ously in one direction. The coil is mounted on an iron cylinder called the rotor or
armature, Fig.20–37. Actually, there are several coils, although only one is indicated
in Fig. 20–37. The armature is mounted on a shaft or axle. When the armature 
is in the position shown in Fig. 20–37, the magnetic field exerts forces on the 
current in the loop as shown (perpendicular to 
and to the current direction).
However, when the coil, which is rotating clockwise in Fig. 20–37, passes beyond
the vertical position, the forces would then act to return the coil back toward the
vertical if the current remained the same. But if the current could be reversed at
that critical moment, the forces would reverse, and the coil would continue rotating
in the same direction. Thus, alternation of the current is necessary if a motor is to
turn continuously in one direct
