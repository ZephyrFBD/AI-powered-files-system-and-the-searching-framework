ugs or have industrial
applications. Because they have specialized adaptations that allow them to live in extreme conditions, many extremophiles
cannot survive in moderate environments. There are many different groups of extremophiles: They are identified based on
the conditions in which they grow best, and several habitats are extreme in multiple ways. For example, a soda lake is
both salty and alkaline, so organisms that live in a soda lake must be both alkaliphiles and halophiles (Table 22.1). Other
extremophiles, like radioresistant organisms, do not prefer an extreme environment (in this case, one with high levels of
radiation), but have adapted to survive in it (Figure 22.5).
