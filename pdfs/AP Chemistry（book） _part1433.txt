In each structure, the electron-domain geometry at nitrogen is 
trigonal planar, which implies sp2 hybridization of the N atom. 
It is helpful when considering delocalized p bonding to consider 
atoms with lone pairs that are bonded to the central atom to be 
sp2 hybridized as well. Thus, we can envision that each of the O 
atoms in the anion has three sp2 hybrid orbitals in the plane of the 
ion. Each of the four atoms has an unhybridized p orbital oriented 
perpendicular to the plane of the ion.
The NO3
- ion has 24 valence electrons. We can first use the sp2 
hybrid orbitals on the four atoms to construct the three N ¬O s 
bonds. That uses all of the sp2 hybrids on the N atom and one sp2 
hybrid on each O atom. Each of the two remaining sp2 hybrids on 
each O atom is used to hold a nonbonding pair of electrons. Thus, 
for any of the resonance structures, we have the following arrange-
ment in the plane of the ion:
