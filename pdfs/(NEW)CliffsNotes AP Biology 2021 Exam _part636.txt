the substrate, making their removal difficult.
Moths move toward light at night.
 
Sharks move toward food when food odors reach them by diffusion or by bulk flow (ocean currents).
Female mosquitos find mammals (on which they feed) by
moving toward CO2 and lactic acid.
3. Migration is the long-distance, seasonal movement of animals. It is usually in response to seasonal availability of
food or degradation of environmental conditions. (These usually occur together.)
Whales, birds, elk, insects, and bats are examples of animals that migrate to warmer climates.
Migrating birds use the sun or stars (celestial cues) or the magnetic field of the earth, or both, to find their migratory
destinations.
Animal Rhythms
A circadian rhythm is a pattern of physiological or behavioral activity that is aligned with the 24-hour cycle in a
day. Also called a biological clock, the rhythm can persist without external cues, although external cues such as
light can help reset and maintain synchronization of
