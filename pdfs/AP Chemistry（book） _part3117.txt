certain sponta-
neous process the system undergoes an entropy change of 
4.2 J>K; therefore, the entropy change of the surroundings 
must be -4.2 J>K.
 19.26  (a) Does the entropy of the surroundings increase for spon-
taneous processes? (b) In a particular spontaneous process 
the entropy of the system decreases. What can you con-
clude about the sign and magnitude of ∆Ssurr? (c) During 
a certain reversible process, the surroundings undergo an 
entropy change, ∆Ssurr = -78 J>K. What is the entropy 
change of the system for this process?
 19.27  (a) What sign for ∆S do you expect when the volume of 
0.200 mol of an ideal gas at 27 °C is increased isothermally 
from an initial volume of 10.0 L? (b) If the final volume 
is 18.5 L, calculate the entropy change for the process. 
 
(c) Do you need to specify the temperature to calculate the 
entropy change?
 19.28  (a) What sign for ∆S do you expect when the pressure on 
0.600 mol of an ideal gas at 350 K is increased isothermally 
from an
