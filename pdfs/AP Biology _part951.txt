function of geographic distance.

but one of them will be deactivated in every cell. Which one of the
two becomes inactive occurs randomly and independently in each
embryonic cell. So, females are considered to be mosaics because
they contain two types of cells, in terms of what genes a cell
contains. This does not apply to men because men only have one X
chromosome in each cell.
(C) The survival of mutant flies + drosomycin was greater than that
of mutant flies + defensin. Choice A is incorrect because clearly the
AMPs provided some immunity. You see that drosomycin provided
strong immunity (line B on the graph) and the defensing provided
weaker immunity (line C on the graph) but both still had a survival
rate than the mutant alone (line D on the graph). Choice B is
incorrect because there was no mutant tested that
