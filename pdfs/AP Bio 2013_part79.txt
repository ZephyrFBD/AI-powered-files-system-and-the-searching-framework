bacteriorhodopsin) used to generate the absorption spectrum in each 
of the graphs above. Explain and justify your answer. 
(b) In an experiment, identical organisms containing the pigment from Graph II as the predominant light-
capturing pigment are separated into three groups. The organisms in each group are illuminated with light  
of a single wavelength (650 nm for the first group, 550 nm for the second group, and 430 nm for the  
third group). The three light sources are of equal intensity, and all organisms are illuminated for equal 
lengths of time. Predict the relative rate of photosynthesis in each of the three groups. Justify your 
predictions. 
(c) Bacteriorhodopsin has been found in aquatic organisms whose ancestors existed before the ancestors of 
plants evolved in the same environment. Propose a possible evolutionary history of plants that could have 
resulted in a predominant photosynthetic system that uses only some of the colors of the visible light 
spectrum.
