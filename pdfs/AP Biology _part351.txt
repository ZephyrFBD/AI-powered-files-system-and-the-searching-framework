MicroRNA (miRNA)—is a small, single-stranded RNA that is about
22 nucleotides long. It does not code for protein. Instead, it targets specific
mRNA molecules—to either degrade them or block their translation. It
has been estimated that the expression of at least one-half of all human
genes may be regulated by miRNA.
Small interfering RNA (siRNA)—are similar to miRNA in size and
function. The blocking of gene expression by siRNA is called RNA
interference (RNAi). The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for
2006 was awarded to Andrew Fire and Craig Mello for their discovery of
how interfering RNA, or RNAi, can play a role in silencing genes. It does
this by binding to and destroying mRNA before it can be translated.
Piwi-associated RNA (piRNA)—recently discovered—is a large class
of ncRNAs that guide PIWI proteins to complementary RNAs which are
derived from transposable elements (elements that can move within the
genome, also k
