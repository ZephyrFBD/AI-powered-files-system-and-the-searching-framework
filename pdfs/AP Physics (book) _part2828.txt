good because of aberrations
and, more importantly, turbulence in the atmosphere. In fact, large-diameter objec-
tives are not justified by increased resolution, but by their greater light-gathering
ability—they allow more light in, so fainter objects can be seen. Radiotelescopes
are not hindered by atmospheric turbulence, and the resolution found in (b) is
a good estimate.
For a microscope, it is more convenient to specify the actual distance, s,
between two points that are just barely resolvable: see Fig. 25–31. Since objects
are normally placed near the focal point of the microscope objective, the angle
subtended by two objects is 
so 
If we combine this with
Eq. 25–7, we obtain the resolving power (RP) of a microscope
[microscope]
(25;8)
where f is the objective lens’ focal length (not frequency) and D its diameter. The
distance s is called the resolving power of the lens because it is the minimum
separation of two object points that can just be resolved—assuming the highest
quality
