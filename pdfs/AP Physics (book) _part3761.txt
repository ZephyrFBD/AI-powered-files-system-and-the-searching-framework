after almost 
years. The
universe continued to evolve until today, some 14 billion years after it started.

This scenario, like other scientific models, cannot be said to be “proven.”Yet
this model is remarkably effective in explaining the evolution of the universe we
live in, and makes predictions which can be tested against the next generation of
observations.
A major event, and something only discovered recently, is that when the
universe was about half as old as it is now (about 7 Gyr ago), its expansion began
to accelerate. This was a big surprise because it was assumed the expansion of the
universe would slow down due to gravitational attraction of all objects toward
each other. This acceleration in the expansion of the universe is said to be due to
“dark energy,” as we discuss in Section 33–9. On the right in Fig. 33–29 is
a narrow vertical strip that represents the most recent 
years of the
universe, during which dark energy seems to have dominated.
