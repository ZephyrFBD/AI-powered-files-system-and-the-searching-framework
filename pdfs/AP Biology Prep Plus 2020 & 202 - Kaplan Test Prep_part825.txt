AP EXPERT NOTE
The biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen are good
examples of areas in which you can relate several concepts in
biology. Examples of processes that are involved in the recycling
of these elements are photosynthesis, cellular respiration,
hydrolysis, and condensation.
Phosphorous is another important nutrient that moves through the
environment in a cycle. The phosphorus cycle begins when phosphate
Carbon Cycle
(PO43–) from weathered rock moves into soils. Plants then take up
phosphate, and it becomes part of the living ecosystem. Like nitrogen,
phosphate moves through living things as they feed on one another, and
it reenters the ecosystem through the decomposers’ action on waste and
dead remains. The phosphorus cycle stands apart from the water,
nitrogen, and carbon cycles because it has no gas phase.
Ecosystems
In ecology, the levels of organization from lowest complexity to highest
are organism, population, co
