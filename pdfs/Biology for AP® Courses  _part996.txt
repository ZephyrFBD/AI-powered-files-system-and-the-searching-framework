ve the
theory:
i. a “transitional species” with cellular features that are
intermediate cells with and without mitochondria
ii. a “transitional organelle” with some features, such as
compartmentalized metabolic processes, but not other
features, such as DNA
Explain how the following evidence supports the theory
of endosymbiosis:
iii. bacteria live within your intestines, but you still have a
separate identity
iv. no one has directly observed the fusion of two
organisms in which a single organism results
51. Discovering the carbon-fixation reactions (or light-
independent reactions) of photosynthesis earned Melvin
Calvin a Nobel Prize in 1961. The isolation and
identification of the products of algae exposed to 14C
revealed the path of carbon in photosynthesis. 14C was fed
to the algal culture in the form of bicarbonate ion (HCO3-).
To agitate the culture, air, which contains CO2, was
bubbled through the system, so there were two sources of
carbon.
Since Calvin’s experiment, research ha
