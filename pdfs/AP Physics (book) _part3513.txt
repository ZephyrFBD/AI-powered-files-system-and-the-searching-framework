netic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
For producing medically useful NMR images—now commonly called MRI, or
magnetic resonance imaging—the element most used is hydrogen since it is the
commonest element in the human body and gives the strongest NMR signals.
The experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 31–25. The large coils set up the
static magnetic field, and the RF coils produce the RF pulse of electromagnetic
waves (photons) that cause the nuclei to jump from the lower state to the upper
one (Fig. 31–24). These same coils (or another coil) can detect the absorption of
energy or the emitted radiation (also of frequency
Eq. 31–11) when
the nuclei jump back down to the lower state.
