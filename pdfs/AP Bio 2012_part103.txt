 the same 
number of phosphate groups. Thus, the influence of phosphate groups on both 
segmentsâ€™ solubility in water is equal.
(C)
This option is correct. It demonstrates an understanding of the relationship 
between structure and function at the molecular level and the ability to make 
predictions about how change(s) in structure affect functionality. Because 
G-C base pairs have three hydrogen bonds, they are more stable structurally. 
Thus, because DNA Segment 2 has more G-C base pairs than DNA Segment 1, 
Segment 2 is more stable and thus would denature at higher temperatures than 
Segment 1.
(D)
This option is incorrect. The structure of DNA is universal to all life, both 
prokaryotes and eukaryotes. DNA from all organisms consists of both A-T and 
C-G base pairs.
