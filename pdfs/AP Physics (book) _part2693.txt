er of the reflected spectrum (around 550 nm). The extremes of the
spectrum—red and violet—will not be reduced as much. Since a mixture of red
and violet produces purple, the light seen reflected from such coated lenses is
purple (Fig. 24–35). Lenses containing two or three separate coatings can more
effectively reduce a wider range of reflecting wavelengths.

wave. The amplitudes add, but they are of opposite
sign, so the total amplitude is reduced to zero if the
two amplitudes are equal. Destructive interference
occurs whenever the phase difference is half a wave
cycle, or the path difference is a half-integral number
of wavelengths. Thus, the total amplitude will be zero
if two identical waves arrive one-half wavelength
out of phase, or 
out of phase, where m is
an integer.
4. For thin-film interference, an extra half-wavelength
phase shift occurs when light reflects from an o
