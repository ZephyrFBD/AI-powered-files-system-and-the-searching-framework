er vapor. Trichomes are hair-like structures on the epidermal
surface. They help to reduce transpiration (the loss of water by aboveground plant parts), increase solar reflectance, and
store compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores.
Figure 23.8 Openings called stomata (singular: stoma) allow a plant to take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen and
water vapor. The (a) colorized scanning-electron micrograph shows a closed stoma of a dicot. Each stoma is flanked
by two guard cells that regulate its (b) opening and closing. The (c) guard cells sit within the layer of epidermal cells

Vascular Tissue
The xylem and phloem that make up the vascular tissue of the stem are arranged in distinct strands called vascular bundles,
which run up and down the length of the
