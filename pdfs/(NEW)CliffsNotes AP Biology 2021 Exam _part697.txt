at can be supported declines rapidly. However, more efficient ecosystems, with higher
photosynthetic efficiency, can generate longer food chains and more complex food webs. Such ecosystems occur in
tropical rain forests.
3. Stability of trophic levels. In ecosystems with long food chains, top trophic levels are more susceptible to
damage because there are more levels below them that can be weakened by environmental changes.
4. Requirements of top predators. The top predators that occupy the upper most tier are usually large animals with
proportionately large energy requirements. Thus the size of top tiers is limited both because there is less biomass
available at the top of the pyramid and because the individual energy requirements of the animals are large.
The size of trophic levels can also be regulated by interactions between the levels. Two interaction models are
described:
1. A bottom-up model describes how changes in the structure of trophic levels are regulated by changes in the
