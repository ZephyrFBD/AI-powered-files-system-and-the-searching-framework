41. The RAS protein is a G-protein connected with the
response to RTKs that initiates the MAPK kinase cascade
when GDP is released and GTP uploaded. Mutations in the
RAS protein which interfere with its GTPase activity are
common in cancer. Evaluate the connection between the
inability of RAS to hydrolyze GTP and uncontrolled cell
proliferation.
a.
RAS, when bound to GTP, becomes permanently
inactive even in the presence of the ligand, and
no longer regulates cell division.
b.
RAS, when bound to GTP, becomes permanently
active even in the absence of the ligand, and no
longer regulates cell division.
c.
RAS, when bound to GTP, forms a dimer after
binding to the ligand, and causes uncontrolled
division, but it remains inactive when the ligand
is absent.
d.
RAS, when bound to GTP, does not form a
dimer after binding to the ligand but stimulates
downstream signaling to occur and causes
uncontrolled cell division.
