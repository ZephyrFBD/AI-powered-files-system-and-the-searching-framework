15–2 Thermodynamic Processes and
the First Law
Let us analyze some thermodynamic processes in light of the first law of 
thermodynamics.
Isothermal Processes 
To begin, we choose a very simple system: a fixed mass of an ideal gas enclosed in
a container fitted with a movable piston as shown in Fig. 15–1.
First we consider an idealized process, such as adding heat or doing work, that is
carried out at constant temperature. Such a process is called an isothermal process
(from the Greek meaning “same temperature”). If the system is an ideal gas, then
(Eq. 13–3), so for a fixed amount of gas kept at constant temperature,
Thus a gra
