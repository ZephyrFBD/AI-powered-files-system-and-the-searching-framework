t, I, refers to the rate of flow of electric
charge and is measured in amperes (A): 1 A equals a flow of
past a given point.
The direction of conventional current is that of positive
charge flow. In a wire, it is actually negatively charged elec-
trons that move, so they flow in a direction opposite to the
conventional current. A positive charge flow in one direction is
almost always equivalent to a negative charge flow in the
opposite direction. Positive conventional current always flows
from a high potential to a low potential.
The resistance R of a device is defined by the relation
(18–2)
where I is the current in the device when a potential difference V
is applied across it. For materials such as metals, R is a constant
independent of V (thus 
), a result known as Ohm’s law.
Thus, the current I coming from a battery of voltage V depends
on the resistance R of the circuit connected to it.
Voltage is applied across a device or between the ends of a
wire. Current passes through a wire
