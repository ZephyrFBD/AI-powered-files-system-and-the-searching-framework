1: Concept Explanation
Individual and/or set-based multiple-
choice questions assess students’ 
ability to explain biological concepts, 
processes, and models presented in 
written format.
Free-response questions 1, 2, 3, 
4, and 5 include one or two points 
per question that assess Science 
Practice 1.
Students will need to describe and 
explain these concepts, processes, 
and models in both conceptual and 
applied contexts. 
2: Visual Representations
Individual and/or set-based multiple-
choice questions will assess 
students’ ability to analyze visual 
representations of biological  
concepts and processes.
Students will need to describe 
characteristics of a biological 
concept, process, or model 
represented visually, as well as 
explain relationships between these 
different characteristics. Additionally, 
students will need to explain how 
biological concepts or processes 
represented visually relate to larger 
biological principles, concepts, 
processes, or theories.
