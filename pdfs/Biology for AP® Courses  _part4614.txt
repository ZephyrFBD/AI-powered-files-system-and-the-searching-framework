It is well established by the theory of natural selection that changes in the environment play a major role in

The three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a freshwater fish that evolved from a saltwater fish
to live in freshwater lakes about 10,000 years ago, which is considered a recent development in evolutionary
time (Figure 37.7). Over the last 10,000 year
