The rate of photosynthesis can be measured by the rate of consumption of the reactants (CO2 or H2O) or by the
rate of production of the products (C6H12O6 or O2).
In this lab investigation, the floating leaf disk technique is used to measure the production of oxygen during
photosynthesis. A hole punch or sturdy straw is used to create 10 equal-sized disks from a leaf. Spinach works well
for this because it has a high concentration of chlorophyll and is a relatively soft leaf with no waxy cuticle that could
impede the movement of materials into or out of the leaf. The disks are placed in a syringe that contains a 1%
sodium bicarbonate solution. The bicarbonate enriches the carbon dioxide content of the solution.
The syringe is capped, and the plunger of the syringe is pulled out about 1 or 2 cm to create a vacuum in the
syringe. The interior of a leaf contains air spaces between the chloroplast-containing mesophyll cells. When a
vacuum is formed in the syringe, the air in the spa
