48. Bacteriophages are a class of viruses that infect bacteria. Upon
entering a bacterium, a phage can enter into one of two
reproductive cycles: the lytic and the lysogenic. What is the main
diﬀerence between the lytic and lysogenic cycles of phage
reproduction?
The lysogenic cycle alters the bacteria, while the lytic cycle
does not.

The lysogenic cycle kills the host cell, while the lytic cycle
does not.
