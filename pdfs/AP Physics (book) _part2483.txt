 to avoid a time lag between speakers? Explain.
7. In the electromagnetic spectrum, what type of EM wave would
have a wavelength of 
1 km? 1 m? 1 cm? 1 mm? 1 mm?
103 km?
8. Can radio waves have the same frequencies as sound waves
(20 Hz–20,000 Hz)?
9. If a radio transmitter has a vertical antenna, should a
receiver’s antenna (rod type) be vertical or horizontal to
obtain best reception?
10. The carrier frequencies of FM broadcasts are much higher
than for AM broadcasts. On the basis of what you learned
about diffraction in Chapter 11, explain why AM signals
can be detected more readily than FM signals behind low
hills or buildings.
11. Discuss how cordless telephones make use of EM waves.
What about cell phones?
12. A lost person may signal by switching a flashlight on and off
using Morse code. This is actually a modulated EM wave.
Is it AM or FM? What is the frequency of the carrier,
approximately?

and an X-ray?
