s with water conservation adaptations (thick cuticles, perhaps) are favored.
Darwinâ€™s finches are a model for adaptive radiation. The finches inhabit the Galapagos Islands, a group of isolated
islands off the coast of South America. Descendants from a single mainland species spread to the various islands
where different ecological regions were available for colonization. The bodies of water between the islands provided
a barrier that maintained isolation and led to allopatric speciation. But on each individual island, sympatric
speciation occurred as finches competed for common resources. The ability to obtain food, an important
characteristic for survival, led to specialization in sizes and shapes of beaks, and, eventually, speciation. Today, as a
result of allopatric speciation of populations on separate islands and sympatric speciation on each individual island,
there are 14 species of finches, each adapted for obtaining different kinds of food (seeds, fruit, nectar, insects) and
