across a membrane. The direction in which water diffuses is determined by
water potential (ψ). Free water, water not bound to solutes, diffuses from
regions of higher water potential to lower water potential. Special transport
proteins called aquaporins facilitate the rapid osmosis of water across
membranes. The opening and closing of these selective channels affect the
rate at which water flows, not its direction. As it moves, water can
perform work, such as cell expansion. Cell swelling is the basic
mechanism by which stomates open and close.
Long-Distance Transport
Long-distance transport in plants occurs through bulk flow, the movement
of liquid from high pressure to low pressure in response to a pressure
gradient. Unlike osmosis, bulk flow is independent of solute concentration.

Long-distance bulk flow carries material through xylem and phloem
vessels.
Phloem transports sugar throughout the plant by a process called
