ids (Figure 7.20). All have characteristic metallic 
properties, such as a silvery, metallic luster, and high thermal and electrical con-
ductivity. The name alkali comes from an Arabic word meaning “ashes.” Many com-
pounds of sodium and potassium, two alkali metals, were isolated from wood ashes 
by early chemists.
As Table 7.4 shows, the alkali metals have low densities and melting points, and 
these properties vary in a fairly regular way with increasing atomic number. We 
see the usual trends as we move down the group, such as increasing atomic radius 
and decreasing first ionization energy. The alkali metal of any given period has the

metals, is soft enough to be cut with a knife.
