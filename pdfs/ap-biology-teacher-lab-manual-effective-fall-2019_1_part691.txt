iable on the rate of transpiration. The skills and concepts may be taught through 
a variety of methods in an open-inquiry investigation. Transpiration rates may be 
measured by several means, including the use of a potometer with or without a gas 
pressure sensor and computer interface or the use of the whole plant method. Only two 
methods are detailed, and any alternative procedure may be equally and successfully 
substituted. 
The equipment is simple, the materials are few, and the cost is low (with the exception 
of the initial purchase of probes and computer interfaces, which can be used for myriad 
investigations). Staining of stomatal peels is not necessary; if contrast is low, direct 
students to adjust (close) the condenser aperture diaphragm. A typical stomatal peel 
prepared for observation without staining looks something like Figure 3.
