s (which have a higher water potential) to hypertonic solutions (which have a lower
water potential).
Calculating Water Potential
The water potential of a solution has two components: a component that depends on the amount of solute and a
component that depends on pressure, as shown in the following equation:
ψs is the water potential due to the solute concentration (solute potential). ψp is the water potential due to the
pressure on the system (pressure potential).
TIP
You do not need to memorize the formula for water potential; it will be on the AP Biology Equations and Formulas sheet.
When you drink a liquid through a straw, you are using negative pressure potential. As you suck air from the
straw, you create a negative pressure in the straw. The liquid in your drink then moves from an area of higher
pressure potential (in the cup) into an area of lower pressure potential (in the straw). An example of positive
pressure potential would be Super Soaker water toys. In those toys, you c
