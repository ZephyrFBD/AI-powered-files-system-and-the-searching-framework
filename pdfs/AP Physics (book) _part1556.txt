CHAPTER 14
Heat
A resting person naturally produces heat internally at a rate of about 100 W, as
we will see in Section 15–3, less than the heat loss by radiation as calculated in
Example 14–9. Hence, our person’s temperature would drop, causing considerable
discomfort. The body responds to excessive heat loss by increasing its metabolic rate,
and shivering is one method by which the body increases its metabolism. Naturally,
clothes help a lot. Example 14–9 illustrates that a person may be uncomfortable
even if the temperature of the air is, say, 25°C, which is quite a warm room. If 
the walls or floor are cold, radiation to them occurs no matter how warm the air 
is. Indeed, it is estimated that radiation accounts for about 50% of the heat loss
from a sedentary person in a normal room. Rooms are most comfortable when the
walls and floor are warm and the air is not so warm. Floors and walls
