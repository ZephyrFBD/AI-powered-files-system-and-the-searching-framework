 effect of age, but the passage 
states that the corals were grown in the same laboratory conditions.
(D) 
Incorrect. This experiment is also measuring the difference between the 
amount of DMSP produced by corals versus corals and algae together 
but is not measuring the difference between coral species.

5.B: Use confidence intervals 
and/or error bars (both 
determined using standard 
errors) to determine whether 
sample means are statistically 
different.
ENE-3.B: Explain how 
negative feedback helps to 
maintain homeostasis.
Feedback
(A) 
Incorrect. The error bars at 32°C overlap between days 0 and 5, 
indicating they are not statistically different.
(B) 
Incorrect. The error bars at 27°C overlap between days 0 and 5, 
indicating they are not statistically different.
(C) 
Correct. The error bars for days 5 and 10 do not overlap between 
temperature treatments, indicating that they are statistically different.
