io even though the total
population numbers fluctuate.
c.
Increasing prey numbers trigger decreases in
predator numbers, which eventually causes a
decrease in prey numbers as predators become
too sparse, and then the cycle repeats.
d.
A prey population undergoes a cyclic increasing
and decreasing fluctuation in size as its predator
population undergoes the same cycle but in a
mirror image relationship.
33. In a region in Texas, biologists observed that two
highly venomous snakes with similar markings deter owl
predators. Upon closer inspection, the snakes were
determined to belong to different genera and species. How
would these biologists describe the mimicry in this case?
a.
Batesian mimicry, because it involves nontoxic
species that resembles a toxic species.
b.
Emsleyan/Mertensian mimicry because an
extremely toxic species resembles a less toxic
species.
c.
Batesian mimicry because it involves an
extremely toxic species that resembles a less
toxic species.
d.
Mullerian mimicry beca
