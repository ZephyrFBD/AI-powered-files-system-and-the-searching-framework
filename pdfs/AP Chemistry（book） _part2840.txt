 17.96  How many microliters of 1.000 M NaOH solution must 
be added to 25.00 mL of a 0.1000 M solution of lactic acid 
3CH3CH1OH2COOH or HC3H5O34 to produce a buffer with 
pH = 3.75?
 17.97  Lead(II) carbonate, PbCO3, is one of the components of the 
passivating layer that forms inside lead pipes. (a) If the Ksp 
for PbCO3 is 7.4 * 10 - 14 what is the molarity of Pb2+  in 
a saturated solution of lead(II) carbonate? (b) What is the 
concentration in ppb of Pb2+ ions in a saturated solution? 
(c) Will the solubility of PbCO3 increase or decrease as the 
pH is lowered? (d) The EPA threshold for acceptable levels 
of lead ions in water is 15 ppb. Does a saturated solution of 
lead(II) carbonate produce a solution that exceeds the EPA 
limit?
 17.98  For each pair of compounds, use Ksp values to determine 
which has the greater molar solubility: (a) CdS or CuS, 
(b) PbCO3 or BaCrO4, (c) Ni1OH22 or NiCO3, (d) AgI or 
Ag2SO4.
