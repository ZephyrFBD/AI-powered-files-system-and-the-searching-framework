s), enthalpies of combustion 
(∆H for combusting a substance in oxygen), and so forth. A particularly 
important process used for tabulating thermochemical data is the formation of a com-
pound from its constituent elements. The enthalpy change associated with this process 
is called the enthalpy of formation (or heat of formation), ∆Hf, where the subscript f 
indicates that the substance has been formed from its constituent elements.
The magnitude of any enthalpy change depends on the temperature, pressure, and 
state (gas, liquid, or solid crystalline form) of the reactants and products. To compare 
enthalpies of different reactions, we must define a set of conditions, called a standard 
state, at which most enthalpies are tabulated. The standard state of a substance is its pure 
form at atmospheric pressure (1 atm) and the temperature of interest, which we usually 
choose to be 298 K 125 °C2.* The standard enthalpy change of a reaction is defined 
as the enthalpy change when all rea
