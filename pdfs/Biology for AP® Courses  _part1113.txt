Matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous (“same knowledge”) chromosomes.
Homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same
location, or locus. Genes, the functional units of chromosomes, determine specific characteristics by coding for specific
proteins. Traits are the variations of those characteristics. For example, hair color is a characteristic with traits that are
blonde, brown, or black.
Each copy of a homologous pair of chromosomes originates from a different parent; therefore, the genes themselves are
not identical. The variation of individuals within a species is due to the specific combination of the genes inherited from
both parents. Even a slightly altered sequence of nucleotides within a gene can result in an alternative trait. For example,
there are three possible gene sequences on the human chromosome that
