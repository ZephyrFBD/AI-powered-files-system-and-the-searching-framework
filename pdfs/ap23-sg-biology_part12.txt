 The scientists claim that a reduction in the population size of the Ammodytes sand lances 
will affect the stability of the entire coastal ecosystem. Provide reasoning to support the 
scientists’ claim. 
Accept one of the following: 
• 
There will be a negative effect on other trophic levels because the sand lance 
provides food for many other species. 
• 
There will be a negative effect on other trophic levels because there will be reduced 
energy to transfer (to higher trophic levels).
