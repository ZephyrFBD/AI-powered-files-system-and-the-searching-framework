le nor the genotypic
frequencies would change. The Hardyâ€“Weinberg principle assumes conditions with no mutations, migration, emigration, or
selective pressure for or against genotype, plus an infinite population; while no population can satisfy those conditions, the
principle offers a useful model against which to compare real population changes.
Working under this theory, population geneticists represent different alleles as different variables in their mathematical
models. The variable p, for example, typically represents the frequency of the dominant allele, say Y for the trait of yellow
in Mendel's peas. The variable q represents the frequency of the recessive allele, in this case y, that confers the color green.
If these are the only two possible alleles for a given locus in the population, p + q = 1. In other words, all the p alleles and
all the q alleles make up all of the alleles for that locus that are found in the population.
