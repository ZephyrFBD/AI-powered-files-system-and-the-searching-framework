a) Homeostasis is important in all living things. In unicellular things, temperature must be maintained and osmotic
pressure must be controlled and pH must be regulated at a cellular level. These same things are important in
multicellular things. In addition, a multicellular thing like a plant or an animal has to coordinate its cells to work together.
