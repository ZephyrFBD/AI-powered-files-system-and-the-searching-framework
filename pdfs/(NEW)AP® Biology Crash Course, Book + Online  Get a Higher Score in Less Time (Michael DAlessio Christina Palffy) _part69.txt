until it eventually results in a response by the
cell.
iii. Common signal transduction pathways include protein modifications such as how methylation
changes the signaling process, protein phosphorylation, activation of G-proteins and cyclic AMP,
or increases in calcium ion levels.
iv. Changes in signal transduction pathways can alter cellular response, and in some cases where the
pathway is blocked or defective, the changes can become deleterious, preventative, or even
prophylactic.
An example would include an organism being bit by a poisonous spider that injects a type of
toxin inside the organismâ€™s body; the poison blocks either a specific transduction pathway or a
series of them. Effective treatment of the bite includes removal of the block to restore the
health of the organism.
Sometimes creating a block of a signal transduction pathway is the goal, so medication like
anesthetics is used on the organism to block pain, for example.
