, but not because they produce adaptations. For example, mutations may introduce a new allele,
but the allele will lead to an adaptation only if it increases in the population as a result of natural selection.
3. C. Gene flow is the increase in allele frequencies due to transfer from other populations.
4. A. Mutations occur randomly and are usually harmful. Whether or not the mutation increases or decreases in
frequency in the population is the result of natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow, or nonrandom mating.
5. B. Only male lions have a mane. Differences in appearance between males and females (sexual dimorphisms) not
directly required for reproduction are usually the result of sexual selection.
6. D. This population is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The values
 
given for p2, 2pq, and q2 correctly total 1.
 
Calculating the value of q from q2 gives
 
or 0.2, and the value of p from p2 gives
 
, which is approximately 0.57. The sum of
these calculated values for p and q
