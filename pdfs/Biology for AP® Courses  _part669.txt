ing that chemical reactions release energy when energy-storing bonds are broken, an important next question
is how is the energy associated with chemical reactions quantified and expressed? How can the energy released from

one reaction be compared to that of another reaction? A measurement of free energy is used to quantitate these energy
transfers. Free energy is called Gibbs free energy (abbreviated with the letter G) after Josiah Willard Gibbs, the scientist
who developed the measurement. Recall that according to the second law of thermodynamics, all energy transfers involve
the loss of some amount of energy in an unusable form such as heat, resulting in entropy. Gibbs free energy specifically
refers to the energy associated with a chemical reaction that is available after entropy is accounted for. In other words, Gibbs
free energy is usable energy, or energy that is available to do work.
Every chemical reaction involves a change in free energy, called del
