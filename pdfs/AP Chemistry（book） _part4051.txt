r and C3H6 are similar, we expect intermolecular attrac-
tions to be more signiﬁcant for the more complex C3H6 molecules, 
and that C3H6 will deviate more from ideal behavior at the condi-
tions listed. If the pressure is high enough for the volume correction 
in the van der Waals equation to dominate behavior, the larger C3H6 
molecules deﬁnitely deviate more than Ar atoms from ideal behavior.

the same. 11.55 (a) Approximately 48 °C (b) approximately 340 torr 
(c) approximately 17 °C (d) approximately 1000 torr 11.57 (a) The 
critical point is the temperature and pressure beyond which the gas 
and liquid phases are indistinguishable. (b) The line that separates 
the gas and liquid phases ends at the critical point because at condi-
tions beyond the critical temperature and pressure, there is no dis-
tinction between gas and liquid. In experimental terms a gas cannot 
be liqueﬁed at temperatures higher than the critical temperature, 
regardless o
