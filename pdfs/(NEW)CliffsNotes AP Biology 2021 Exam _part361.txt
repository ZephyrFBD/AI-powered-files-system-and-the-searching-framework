subsequent cell divisions produce cells that are similarly specialized. Cells become specialized
because transcription factors activate some genes while repressing others. The process is often self-reinforcing—
once certain genes are turned on or off, they remain so. Genes that are permanently turned off are often associated
with DNA methylation and histone modification. The process that fixes a cell’s fate is called cell determination.
Reproductive cloning is the process of making an individual with the same nuclear DNA as another animal. The
first mammal to be cloned was Dolly, a sheep. The process for cloning Dolly and many mammals since was
“somatic cell nuclear transfer.” In this process, the nucleus of an unfertilized egg cell is replaced by the nucleus from
a fully differentiated adult cell (for Dolly, a cell taken from her udder). This demonstrated that determination can be
reversed. A nucleus from a cell whose fate was fixed was unfixed by implanting it in the cytoplasm of a s
