Instructions 
The questions for Section II are printed in this booklet. You may use the unlined pages to 
organize your answers and for scratch work, but you must write your answers on the 
labeled pages provided for each question. 
The proctor will announce the beginning and end of the reading period. You are advised 
to spend the 10-minute period reading all the questions, and to use the unlined pages to 
sketch graphs, make notes, and plan your answers. The focus of the reading period should 
be the organization of questions 1 and 2. 
Each answer should be written in paragraph form; an outline or bulleted list alone is not 
acceptable. Do no
