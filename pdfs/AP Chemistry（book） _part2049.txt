CHAPTER 13 Properties of Solutions
escape from the solution. Thus, the solubility of a gas in a liquid solvent increases in 
direct proportion to the partial pressure of the gas above the solution (Figure 13.13).
The relationship between pressure and gas solubility is expressed by Henry’s law:
 
Sg = kP
g 
[13.4]
Here, Sg is the solubility of the gas in the solvent (usually expressed as molarity), P
g is 
the partial pressure of the gas over the solution, and k is a proportionality constant 
known as the Henry’s law constant. The value of this constant depends on the solute, 
solvent, and tempe
