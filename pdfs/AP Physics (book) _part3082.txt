14. Why do we say that light has wave properties? Why do we
say that light has particle properties?
15. Why do we say that electrons have wave properties? Why
do we say that electrons have particle properties?
16. What are the differences between a photon and an
electron? Be specific: make a list.
17. If an electron and a proton travel at the same speed, which
has the shorter wavelength? Explain.
18. An electron and a proton are accelerated through the same
voltage. Which has the longer wavelength? Explain why.
19. In Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom, what keeps
the electrons from flying off into space?
20. When a wide spectrum of light passes through hydrogen
gas at room temperature, absorption lines are observed
that correspond only to the Lyman series. Why don’t we
observe the other series?
