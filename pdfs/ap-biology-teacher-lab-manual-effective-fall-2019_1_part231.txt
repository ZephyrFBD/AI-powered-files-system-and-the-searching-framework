 1 as a guide to help you design the sequence and nature of your 
spreadsheet calculation. The first step is to randomly draw gametes from the gene pool 
to form a number of zygotes that will make up the next generation. 
To begin this model, let’s define a couple of variables. 
Let 
p = the frequency of the A allele  
and let q = the frequency of the B allele  
Bring up the spreadsheet on your computer. The examples here are based on 
Microsoft® Excel, but almost any modern spreadsheet can work, including Google’s 
online Google Sheets and Zoho’s online spreadsheet. 
Hint: If you are familiar with spreadsheets, the RAND function, and using IF 
statements to create formulas in spreadsheets, you may want to skip ahead and try to 
build a model on your own. If these are not familiar to you, proceed with the following 
tutorial. 
Somewhere in the upper left corner (in this case, cell D2), enter a value for the 
frequency of the A allele. This value should be between 0 and 1. Go ahead and
