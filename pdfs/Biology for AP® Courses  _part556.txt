ed. Some cells require larger amounts of specific substances than do other cells;
they must have a way of obtaining these materials from extracellular fluids. This may happen passively, as certain materials
move back and forth, or the cell may have special mechanisms that facilitate transport. Some materials are so important to a
cell that it spends some of its energy, hydrolyzing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to obtain these materials. Red blood cells
use some of their energy doing just that. Most cells spend the majority of their energy to maintain an imbalance of sodium
and potassium ions between the interior and exterior of the cell.
The most direct forms of membrane transport are passive. Passive transport is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does
not require the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement. In passive transport, substances move from an
area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. A physical space in which there is a range of co
