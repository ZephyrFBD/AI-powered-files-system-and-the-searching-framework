12–7 Doppler Effect
You may have noticed that you hear the pitch of the siren on a speeding fire truck
drop abruptly as it passes you. Or you may have noticed the change in pitch of a
blaring horn on a fast-moving car as it passes by you. The pitch of the engine
noise of a race car changes as the car passes an observer. When a source of sound
is moving toward an observer, the pitch the observer hears is higher than when
the source is at rest; and when the source is traveling away from the observer, the
pitch is lower. This phenomenon is known as the Doppler effect† and occurs for
all types of waves. Let us now see why it occurs, and calculate the difference
between the perceived and source sound frequencies when there is relative motion
between source and observer.
