(b) At this angle 
the lower wave travels an extra distance of one whole wavelength, and the waves 
are in phase; note from the shaded triangle that the path difference equals 
(c) For this angle 
the lower wave travels an extra distance equal to one-half wavelength, so the two waves arrive at the 
screen fully out of phase. (d) A more detailed diagram showing the geometry for parts (b) and (c).
