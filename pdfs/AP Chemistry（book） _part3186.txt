the cathode. (b) Does the zinc electrode gain, lose, or retain 
the same mass as the reaction proceeds? (c) Does the platinum 
electrode gain, lose, or retain the same mass as the reaction 
proceeds? (d) Which electrode is positive?

Why do electrons transfer spontaneously from a Zn atom to a Cu2+ ion, either directly as 
in Figure 20.3 or through an external circuit as in Figure 20.4? In a simple sense, we can 
compare the electron flow to the flow of water in a waterfall (Figure 20.7). Water flows 
spontaneously over a waterfall because of a difference in potential energy between the 
top of the falls and the bottom. 
 (Section 5.1) In a similar fashion, electrons flow 
spontaneously through an external circuit from the anode of a voltaic cell to the cathode 
because of a difference in potential energy. The potential energy of electrons is hig
