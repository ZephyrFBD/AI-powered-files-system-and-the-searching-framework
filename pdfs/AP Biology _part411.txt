and Bacteria. The cell walls of fungi are made of chitin, not
cellulose. (EVO-3)
(A) Archaea is the group that includes the extremophiles. Most
biologists believe that the prokaryotes and the archaea diverged
from each other in very ancient times. One basic way in which the
two differ is in their nucleic acids. (EVO-1 & EVO-2)
(D) Fungi are all heterotrophs. They secrete digestive enzymes and
digest food outside the organism. This is called extracellular
digestion. Once the food is digested and broken down into building
blocks, it is absorbed into the body of the organism by diffusion.
The cell walls of mushrooms consist of chitin. (EVO-2)
(A) The genus is a narrower grouping than the family, so it contains
organisms with fewer differences. (EVO-3)
(D) Dinosaurs, crocodiles, and primates share a common ancestor.
Ray-finned fish do not descend from sharks. They have a very
distant common ancestor in vertebrates. Crocodiles and rodents are
not close relatives a
