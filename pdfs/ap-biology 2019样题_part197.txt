e relationship 
between changes in the 
environment and evolutionary 
changes in the population.
EVO-1.G.1
Convergent evolution occurs when similar 
selective pressures result in similar phenotypic 
adaptations in different populations or species.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
EVO-1.H
Explain how random 
occurrences affect the 
genetic makeup of a 
population.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
EVO-1.H.1
Evolution is also driven by random 
occurrences—
a. Mutation is a random process that 
contributes to evolution.
b. Genetic drift is a nonselective process 
occurring in small populations—
 i. Bottlenecks.
ii. Founder effect.
c. Migration/gene flow can drive evolution.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
EVO-1
Evolution is characterized by a change in the genetic makeup of a population ove
