Stromatolites
Fossilized microbial mats represent the earliest record of life on Earth. A stromatolite is a sedimentary structure formed
when minerals are precipitated out of water by prokaryotes in a microbial mat (Figure 22.3). Stromatolites form layered
rocks made of carbonate or silicate. Although most stromatolites are artifacts from the past, there are places on Earth where
stromatolites are still forming. For example, growing stromatolites have been found in the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park
in San Diego County, California.
