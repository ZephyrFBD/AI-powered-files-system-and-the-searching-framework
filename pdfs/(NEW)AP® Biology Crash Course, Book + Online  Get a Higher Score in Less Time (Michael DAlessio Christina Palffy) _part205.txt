s, this is an example of artificial selection, and
this is evident because the number of plants with the desired trait significantly increased only within
one generation. That would not be the case if natural selection were the only selecting factor.

 Mathematical Modeling: Hardy-Weinberg
Analysis Question: How can the use of mathematical models be used to investigate the relationship
between allele frequencies in populations of organisms with evolutionary change?
Exercise 2A: Using Mathematical Modeling to Test for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
Interpretation of this Exercise
The spreadsheet above represents one version of mathematical modeling that examines all the
gametes, zygotes, and specific alleles within a random sampling of the population. The spreadsheet
calculated the frequency of p (A) and q (B). The main ideas are that natural selection, as part of
evolution, can act on a phenotype and create variations within a population. Evolutionary change is
also driven by random p
