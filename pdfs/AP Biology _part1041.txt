triploid cell has three homologues for each
chromosome. This results in a cell with an extra set of
chromosomes, as in the figure below:
Triploidy can arise from an error during meiosis when one
homologous pair of chromosomes fails to separate as it
normally should. Refer to the figure below:

If that abnormal gamete B combines with a normal gamete
during fertilization, the resulting zygote will have three
homologues instead of two, and it will be triploid for that
chromosome. If gamete A combines with a normal gamete
during fertilization, the resulting zygote will lack an entire
chromosome and most likely will not survive.
The triploid cell (3n) could have a problem reproducing
sexually because it could not produce normal gametes.
The reason why a triploid cell could not produce normal
gametes is because triplet homologues could not line up
correctly (double file) during metaphase of meiosis I. As a
result, homologous pair
