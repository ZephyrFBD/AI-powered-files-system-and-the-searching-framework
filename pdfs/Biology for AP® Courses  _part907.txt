be constantly
shaken at fixed temperature, and from which samples can
be taken without atmospheric contamination, are available
for this study.
These results of the experiment will be used to infer
growth rates of E. coli along the entire 7.5 m length of the
average human intestine (small intestine and large
intestine), where the oxygen content varies from
atmospheric to anaerobic conditions. The retention time of
food in the small intestine, whose average length is 2.5 m,
is approximately four hours. The retention time of food
over the entire length of the intestine is between 24 and 72
hours.
A. Describe and apply a mathematical model that can
be used to represent the variation of oxygen environments
of a bacterium that is being transported with the food
along the length of the intestine.
B. Design the experimental sampling times in terms of
growth intervals of interest in this study: i) the time when
the bacteria is passing the small-large intestine boundary;
ii) the time when the b
