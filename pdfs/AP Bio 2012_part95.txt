cle strength.
(D)

Question 9
Essential Knowledge
1.C.3: Populations of organisms continue to evolve. 
Science Practice
1.2: The student can describe representations and models 
of natural or man-made phenomena and systems in  
the domain.
Learning Objective 
1.25: The student is able to describe a model that 
represents evolution within a population.
(A)
This option is incorrect. The data provide no evidence to support the conclusion 
that speciation has occurred within the finch population, especially from a single 
parent species.
(B)
This option is correct. It demonstrates an understanding of the role of natural 
selection in evolution. Natural selection acts on phenotypic variations in 
populations. During the drought period the environment favored plants with 
thick-walled seeds, and finches with larger beaks had a selective advantage 
over finches with smaller beaks
