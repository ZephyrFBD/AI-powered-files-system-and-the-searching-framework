 fields, not energy.
(d) Radio waves come from electric currents in an antenna. X-rays are not related
to electric charge.
(e) X-rays are made up of particles called photons whereas radio waves are
oscillations in space.
T
he culmination of electromagnetic theory in the nineteenth century was the
prediction, and the experimental verification, that waves of electromagnetic
fields could travel through space. This achievement opened a whole new
world of communication: first the wireless telegraph, then radio and television,
and more recently cell phones, remote-control devices, wi-fi, and Bluetooth.
Most important was the spectacular prediction that light is an electromagnetic
wave.
The theoretical prediction of electromagnetic waves was the work of the
Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879; Fig. 22–1), who unified, in one
magnificent theory, all the phenomena of electricity and magnetism.
