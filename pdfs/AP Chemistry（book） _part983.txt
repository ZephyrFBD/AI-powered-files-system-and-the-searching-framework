The order in which electrons are added to 
orbitals is read left to right beginning in the 
top-left corner.
The number of columns in each block corresponds to the maximum number of 
electrons that can occupy each kind of subshell. Recall that 2, 6, 10, and 14 are the 
numbers of electrons that can fill the s, p, d, and f subshells, respectively. Thus, the s 
block has 2 columns, the p block has 6, the d block has 10, and the f  block has 14. Recall 
also that 1s is the first s subshell, 2p is the first p subshell, 3d is the first d subshell, and 
4f is the first f subshell, as Figure 6.30 shows. Using these facts, you can write the elec-
tron configuration of an element based merely on its position in the periodic table. 
Remember: The periodic table is your best guide to the order in which orbitals are filled.
