Sample Exercise 4.6
Identifying Strong, Weak, and Nonelectrolytes
Classify these dissolved substances as a strong electrolyte, weak electrolyte, or nonelectrolyte: CaCl2, HNO3, C2H5OH (ethanol), 
HCOOH (formic acid), KOH.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of these substances, when dissolved in water, is a strong 
electrolyte? (a) ammonia (b) hydrofluoric acid (c) folic acid  
(d) sodium nitrate (e) sucrose
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Consider solutions in which 0.1 mol of each of the following 
compounds is dissolved in 1 L of water: Ca1NO322 (calcium 
nitrate), C6H12O6 (glucose), NaCH3COO (sodium acetate), and 
CH3COOH (acetic acid). Rank the solutions in order of increas-
ing electrical conductivity, knowing that t
