for phagocytosis, or activate the
complement cascade. Because secreted antibodies can remain in the circulation for many years, secondary exposure to a
pathogen results in a faster immune response. Antibodies occur in the blood, in gastric and mucus secretions, and in breast
milk, thus providing passive immunity to the infant.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 and Big Idea 4
of the AP速 Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP速 exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
