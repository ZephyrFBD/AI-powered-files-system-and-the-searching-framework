acid content. (B) is
incorrect because bacteria in colder environments require additional
fluidity, not additional rigidity. (C) is incorrect because the high
temperatures that G. stearothermophilus is exposed to require greater
rigidity, not greater fluidity, which is why the species contains such a
small proportion of unsaturated fatty acids.

Molecular oxygen is a small, hydrophobic molecule that diﬀuses
through the layer of surfactants and the thin epithelium in an alveolus.
The higher the concentration of oxygen, the greater will be the rate of
diﬀusion, as seen in Graph A. (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect
because the membrane is permeable to molecules like oxygen and
TEST WHAT YOU LEARNED
because oxygen diﬀuses down its concentration gradient. (C) and (D)
are incorrect because they indicate the wrong graph and because
oxygen neither binds to a carrier nor flows by osmosis (osmosis
specifically describes the diﬀusion of water).
