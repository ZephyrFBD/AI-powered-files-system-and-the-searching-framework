he Hypothalamus
The hypothalamus plays a special role in the body; it is the bridge
between the endocrine and nervous systems. The hypothalamus acts as part
of the nervous system when, in times of stress, it sends electrical signals to
the adrenal gland to release adrenaline. It acts like a nerve when it secretes
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from neurosecretory cells that
stimulate the anterior pituitary to secrete FSH and LH. It acts as an
endocrine gland when it produces oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone
that it stores in the posterior pituitary. The hypothalamus also contains the
bodyâ€™s thermostat and centers for regulating hunger and thirst.
The hypothalamus receives information from nerves throughout the

body, including the brain. In response, it initiates endocrine signaling
appropriate to the environmental conditions. For example in many
vertebrates, nerve signals from the brain pass sensory information about
seasonal changes
