ception. These
hormones play an important role in allowing plants to grow, develop, survive, and adapt to environmental cues.
They act as signaling molecules, bind to receptors, and function using signal transduction. These cell
communication pathways are similar to what happens in animal cells.
ECOLOGY
The study of interactions between living things and their environments is known as ecology. Weâ€™ve spent most of
our time discussing individual organisms. However, in the real world, organisms are in constant interaction with
other organisms and the environment. The best way for us to understand the various levels of ecology is to progress
from the big picture, the biosphere, down to the smallest ecological unit, the population.
There is a hierarchy within the world of ecology. Each of the following terms represents a different level of
