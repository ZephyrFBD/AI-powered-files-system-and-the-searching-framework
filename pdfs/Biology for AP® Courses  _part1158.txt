 division because it acts when there is damaged DNA in cells that are undergoing the preparatory
processes during G1. If damaged DNA is detected, p53 halts the cell cycle and recruits enzymes to repair the DNA. If the
DNA cannot be repaired, p53 can trigger apoptosis, or cell death, to prevent the duplication of damaged chromosomes.
As p53 levels rise, the production of p21 is triggered. p21 enforces the halt in the cycle dictated by p53 by binding to
and inhibiting the activity of the Cdk/cyclin complexes. As a cell is exposed to more stress, higher levels of p53 and p21
accumulate, making it less likely that the cell will move into the S phase.
Rb exerts its regulatory influence on other positive regulator proteins. Chiefly, Rb monitors cell size. In the active,
dephosphorylated state, Rb binds to proteins called transcription factors, most commonly, E2F (Figure 10.14). Transcription
factors “turn on” specific genes, allowing the production of proteins encoded by that gene. When Rb i
