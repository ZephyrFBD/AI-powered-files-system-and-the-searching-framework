g only a slight change in
temperature. This allows water to act as both an eﬀective coolant
during a hot day, due to the large amount of heat needed to heat up
water, and as a warming mechanism during the fall and winter, since a
large amount of heat release is required to cause the water to become
cold. As a result, winds that blow oﬀ large bodies of warm water make
the temperature less frigid than it would otherwise be. Therefore, (C) is
the correct answer, and (A) and (D) can be eliminated. Similarly, due to
the high heat of vaporization, water molecules must absorb a large
amount of energy to break bonds and change state. Therefore, (B) is
also incorrect because heat is released, not absorbed, during hydrogen
bond formation.

The graph shows that nucleic acid synthesis is the only thing that is
significantly decreased in the Rio Tinto and that the remaining organic
compounds are largely unaﬀected. Therefore, the river must be
deficient in the element tha
