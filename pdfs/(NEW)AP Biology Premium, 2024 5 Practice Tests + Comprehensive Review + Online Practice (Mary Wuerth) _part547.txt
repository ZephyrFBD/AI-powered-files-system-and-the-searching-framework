redators are
present, etc.), a population will experience exponential growth and can be described with the following equation:
In this equation, N represents the population size, and rmax is the maximum per capita growth rate of the
population. Note that the larger the population size, the higher the growth rate and the faster the population will
grow. Exponential growth curves are usually J-shaped, as shown in Figure 23.1.

Some populations will eventually exceed the resources available in their environment, and their growth will be
limited by resource availability. Factors that limit the growth of these populations can be either density-dependent
factors or density-independent factors. Some examples of density-dependent factors that limit population growth
are disease, predation, and competition for food, habitat, or mates. Density-independent factors include temperature,
precipitation, and natural disasters (such as forest fires or volcanic erupti
