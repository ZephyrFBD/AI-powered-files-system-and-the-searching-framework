to a reduction in 
the amount of NH4HS1s2 that is present, assuming in all cases 
that equilibrium is re-established following the change?  
(a) Adding more NH31g2 to the vessel (b) Adding more H2S1g2 
to the vessel (c) Adding more NH4HS1s2 to the vessel  
(d) Increasing the volume of the vessel (e) Decreasing the 
volume of the vessel
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
When added to Fe3O41s2 in a closed container, which one  
of the following substances—H21g2, H2O1g2, O21g2— 
allows equilibrium to be established in the reaction 
3 Fe1s2 + 4 H2O1g2 ∆ Fe3O41s2 + 4 H21g2?
Give It Some Thought
Write the equilibrium-constant expression for the reaction
NH31aq2 + H2O1l 2 ∆ NH4
+1aq2 + OH-1aq2

Calculating Equilibrium Constants
If we can measure the equilibrium concentrations of all the reactants and products in a 
chemical reaction, as we did with the data in Table 15.1, calculating the value of the equi-
librium constant is straightforward. We simply insert all the equilibrium concentrations
