isms, that is, transversion or transition,
for the different mutational signatures among
lung cancers of smokers and those of other
cancers, and for the very similar mutational
signatures of lung cancers of nonsmokers and of
breast and colorectal cancers. The partitioning of
function along the length of the protein can lead
to functional and nonfunctional segments. It is
believed that the transversions due to smoking
are caused by polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The
hotspots for these mutations lie in the segment
that binds to DNA. The transition hotspots are in
segments that regulate apoptosis.
