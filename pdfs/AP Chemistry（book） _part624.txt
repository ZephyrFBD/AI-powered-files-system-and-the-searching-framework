SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the volume (45.7 mL) and molarity  
(0.500 M) of an H2SO4 solution (the standard solution) that re-
acts completely with 20.0 mL of NaOH solution. We are asked to 
calculate the molarity of the NaOH solution.
Plan Following the steps given in Figure 4.19, we use the H2SO4 
volume and molarity to calculate the number of moles of H2SO4. 
Then we can use this quantity and the balanced equation for the 
reaction to calculate moles of NaOH. Finally, we can use moles of 
NaOH and the NaOH volume to calculate NaOH molarity.
Solve 
The number of moles of H2SO4 is the product of the volume 
and molarity of this solution:
 Moles H2SO4 = (
45.7 mL soln)a
1L soln
1000 mL solnb a 0.500 mol H2SO4

b
 = 2.28 * 10-2 mol H2SO4
H2SO41aq2 + 2 NaOH1aq2 ยก 2 H2O1l2 + Na2SO41aq2
According to the balanced equation, 
1 mol H2SO4 ] 2 mol NaOH. Therefore,
 Moles NaOH = 12.28 * 10-2 mol H2SO42a 2 mol NaOH
1 mol H2SO4

 = 4.56 * 10-2 mol NaOH
