ns:
Ni1s2 + 2 Ag+1aq2 ¡ Ni2+1aq2 + 2 Ag1s2
In this reaction, Ni is oxidized and Ag+ is reduced. Therefore, the standard emf for the 
reaction is
 
E ° = E °
red 1Ag+
>Ag2 - E °
red1Ni2+
>Ni2
 = 1+0.80 V2 - 1-0.28 V2 = +1.08 V
The positive value of E° indicates that the displacement of silver by nickel resulting 
from oxidation of Ni metal and reduction of Ag+ is a spontaneous process. Remember 
that although we multiply the silver half-reaction by 2, the reduction potential is not 
multiplied.
Give It Some Thought
Based on their relative positions in Table 4.5, which will have a more positive 
standard reduction potential, Sn2+ or Ni2+?
Emf, Free Energy, and the Equilibrium Constant
The change in the Gibbs free energy, ∆G, is a measure of the spontaneity of a process that 
occurs at constant temperature and pressure. 
 (Section 19.5) The emf, E, of a redox 
reaction also indicates whether the reaction is spontaneous. The relationship between 
emf and the free-energy change is
 
∆G = -n
