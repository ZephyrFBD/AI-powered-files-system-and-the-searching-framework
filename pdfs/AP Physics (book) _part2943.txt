oping it is still valid in
relativity and will give verifiable results. That is, we assume the net work done on
a particle is equal to its change in kinetic energy (ke). Using this principle, Einstein
showed that at high speeds the formula 
is not correct. Instead,
Einstein showed that the kinetic energy of a particle of mass m traveling at speed v
is given by
(26–5a)
In terms of
we can rewrite Eq. 26–5a as
(26–5b)
Equation 26–5a requires some interpretation. The first term increases with the
speed v of the particle. The second term,
is constant; it is called the rest energy
of the particle, and represents a form of energy that a particle has even when at rest.
Note that if a particle is at rest 
the first term in Eq. 26–5a becomes 
so 
as it should.
