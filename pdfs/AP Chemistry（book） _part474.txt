CHAPTER 3 Chemical Reactions and Reaction Stoichiometry
theoretical and Percent Yields
The quantity of product calculated to form when all of a limiting reactant is consumed 
is called the theoretical yield. The amount of product actually obtained, called the 
actual yield, is almost always less than (and can never be greater than) the theoretical 
yield. There are many reasons for this difference. Some of the reactants may not react, for 
example, or they may react in a way different from that desired (side reactions). In addi-
tion, it is not always possible to recover all of the product from the reaction  
mixture. The 
percent yield of a reaction relates actual and theoretical yields:
 
Percent yield =
actual yield
theoretical yield * 100%
