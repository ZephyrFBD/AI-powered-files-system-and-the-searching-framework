t likely shape of the curve if blood oxygen levels of Weddell seals were plotted rather 
than blood lactate levels.  Include in your description the likely shape of the curve between 0 and 
20 minutes and the shape of the curve after 20 minutes. 
Description (2 points maximum; points may be earned from only one row)
0-20 min (1 point)
•
After 20 min (1 point) 
Oxygen levels start high and decline steadily 
Oxygen levels decline more slowly or remain flat 
Oxygen levels start and remain high 
Oxygen levels decline 
(c) The data suggest that Baikal seals can sustain much longer dives than Emperor penguins. Propose a 
hypothesis that could explain the evolution of different dive responses in Emperor penguins and Baikal 
seals. 
Proposal (1 point) 
•
The (genetic/heritable) capacity to sustain dives for longer periods of time provides 
selective/reproductive advantages (access to food/avoidance of predators) for seals but not for 
penguins.
