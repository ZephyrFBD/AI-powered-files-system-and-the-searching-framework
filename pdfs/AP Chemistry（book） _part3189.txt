Give It Some Thought
If a standard cell potential is E°
cell = +0.85 V at 25 °C, is the redox reaction of the 
cell spontaneous?
Standard Reduction Potentials
The standard cell potential of a voltaic cell, E°
cell, depends on the particular cathode and 
anode half-cells. We could, in principle, tabulate the standard cell potentials for all possi-
ble cathode–anode combinations. However, it is not necessary to undertake this arduous 
task. Rather, we can assign a standard potential to each half-cell and then use these half-
cell potentials to determine E°
cell. The cell potential is the difference between two half-cell 
potentials. By convention, the potential associated with each electrode is chosen to be 
the potential for reduction at that electrode. Thus, standard half-cell potentials are tabu-
lated for reduction reactions, which means they are standard reduction potentials, 
denoted E°
red. The standard cell potential, E°
cell, is the
