What
changes occur to (a) the capacitance, (b) the charge on the
plates, (c) the potential difference, (d) the energy stored 
in the capacitor, and (e) the electric field? Explain your
answers.
18. We have seen that the capacitance C depends on the size
and position of the two conductors, as well as on the
dielectric constant K. What then did we mean when we
said that C is a constant in Eq. 17–7?

Digital electronics converts an analog signal voltage into
an approximate digital voltage based on a binary code: each bit
has two possibilities, 1 or 0 (also “on” or “off”). The binary
number 1101 equals 13. A byte is 8 bits and provides 
voltage levels. Sampling rate is the number of voltage measure-
ments done on the analog signal per second. The bit depth is
the number of digital voltage levels available at each sampling.
CDs are 44.1 kHz, 16-bit.
