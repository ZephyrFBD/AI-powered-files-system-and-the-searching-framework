DOMAINS OF THE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 
 
 
3.2.2 Values of the Trigonometric Functions 
To compute values of the trigonometric functions for any real number t, we first determine 
their signs. 
The signs of the trigonometric functions depend on the quadrant in which the terminal 
point of t lies. 
For example, if the terminal point P(x, y) determined by t lies in Quadrant III, then its 
coordinates are both negative. 
So sin t, cos t, csc t, and sec t are all negative, whereas tan t and cot t are positive.

EVALUATING TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS FOR REAL NUMBER 
1. Find the reference number. Find the reference number t bar associated with t. 
2. Find the sign. Determine the sign of the trigonometric function of t by noting the 
quadrant in which the terminal point lies. 
3. Find the value. The value of the trigonometric function of t is the same.
