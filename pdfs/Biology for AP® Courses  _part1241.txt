ent in mitosis.
c.
Mitosis is a process of asexual reproduction in which the number of chromosomes are reduced by half
producing two haploid cells whereas in meiosis two diploid cells are produced by cell division.
d.
Organisms producing through mitosis create genetically identical offspring as only a single parent copies its
entire genetic material to the offspring. In meiosis, two parents produces gametes and the offspring have only
half the number of chromosomes of each parent and hence genetic variation is introduced.
Activity
Create a series of diagrams with annotations to compare and contrast the processes of mitosis and meiosis
in an organism with a haploid number of six. Then, using specific examples, explain how meiosis followed
by fertilization increases genetic variation in a family of organisms.
11.2 | Sexual Reproduction
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
Why are meiosis and sexual reproduction considered evolved traits?
•
Why is variation among o
