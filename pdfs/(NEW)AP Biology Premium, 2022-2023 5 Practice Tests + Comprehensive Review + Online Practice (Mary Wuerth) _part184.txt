a noncompetitive inhibitor. Both types of inhibitors reduce, not increase, the rate of enzyme-catalyzed
reactions, so choice (D) is also incorrect.
10. (B) Enzymes are made of protein, ribozymes are made of RNA, and both have a catalytic effect on chemical
reactions. Choice (A) is incorrect because enzymes never affect whether a reaction is endergonic or exergonic.
Not all enzymes have an optimum pH of 7, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because enzymes
are never consumed in the reactions they catalyze.
Short Free-Response
11. (a) Enzymes interact with a specific substrate that has properties (such as shape and charge) that are compatible
with those at the enzyme’s active site.
(b) Competitive inhibitors bind to enzymes at the active site, whereas allosteric inhibitors bind to enzymes at
the allosteric site.
(c) A decrease in temperature to 5° Celsius would decrease the enzyme’s efficiency.
(d) Decreases in temperature reduce the number of molecular collisions betwee
