nts of the offspring must match the fragments of one or the other parent. The DNA
fragments from individual 3 can be found in either individuals 2 or 4. As a result, it is possible (but not certain) that
individual 3 inherited his or her DNA from individuals 2 and 4. In an actual DNA fingerprinting analysis, many
different restriction enzymes are used so that many different DNA fragments can be compared.
14. D. If only heterozygotes mate, 25% of the offspring, on average, should be homozygous recessive. Thus, this
answer cannot explain the absence of homozygous recessive individuals in the population. Because the population is
so small, genetic drift may be responsible. Alternately, natural selection against individuals with a deleterious
homozygous recessive genotype may also explain why this genotype is absent from the population. Note, however,
that the recessive allele remains in the population because it is masked by the dominant allele in heterozygous
individuals. The absence of
