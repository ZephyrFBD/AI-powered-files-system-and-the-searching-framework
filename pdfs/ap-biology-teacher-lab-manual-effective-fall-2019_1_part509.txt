rotate the plate approximately 45 degrees and start the 
second streak. Do not dip into the rehydrated bacteria a second time! Go into 
the previous streak about two times and then back and forth as shown for a total 
of about 10 times. 
c. Rotate the plate again and repeat streaking. 
d. Rotate the plate for the final time and make the final streak. Repeat steps a–c with 
the remaining LB plates for each student workstation. Although you can use the 
same inoculation loop for all starter plates, it is recommended that you use a new, 
sterile loop for each plate if you have enough. When you are finished with each 
plate, cover it immediately to avoid contamination. 
e. Place the plates upside down inside the incubator overnight at 37°C or at room 
temperature for 2–3 days if an incubator is unavailable. Use for transformation 
within 24–36 hours because bacteria must be actively growing to achieve high 
transformation efficiency. (Remember, bacterial growth is exponential.) Do not
