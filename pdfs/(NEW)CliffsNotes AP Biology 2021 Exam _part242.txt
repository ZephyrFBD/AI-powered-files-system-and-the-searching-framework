contrast, during the same phase of mitosis, the
chromosomes all line up and chromatids separate to opposite poles.
2. Crossing over during the condensation phase of meiosis I (prophase I) produces chromosomes with genetic
material from both parents. Also, the joining of gametes during sexual reproduction creates genomes in offspring
that are unique.
3. When the DNA of a cell is damaged by radiation or chemicals, genes that produce proteins that regulate cell
division may have mutated. If, for example, the gene product is a damaged protein that normally monitors the
integrity of the DNA, it may not trigger DNA repair and damaged DNA will be passed on to daughter cells.
Accumulation of damaged DNA may result in a further breakdown of cell cycle regulation, and the cell line may
begin dividing without control, thus becoming cancerous.

a. Mitosis consists of four phasesâ€”prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. In prophase, the chromati
