osed to presenting equations into which 
students are supposed to plug numbers.
The next four chapters (Chapters 6–9) deal with electronic 
structure and bonding. For more advanced students, A Closer 
Look boxes in Chapters 6 and 9 highlight radial probability func-
tions and the phases of orbitals. Our approach of placing this 
latter discussion in A Closer Look box in Chapter 9 enables those 
who wish to cover this topic to do so, while others may wish to 
bypass it. In treating this topic and others in Chapters 7 and 9, 
we have materially enhanced the accompanying figures to more 
effectively bring home their central messages.
In Chapters 10–13, the focus of the text changes to the 
next level of the organization of matter: examining the states 
of matter. Chapters 10 and 11 deal with gases, liquids, and inter-
molecular forces, while Chapter 12 is devoted to solids, present-
ing a contemporary view of the solid state as well as of modern 
materials accessible to general chemistry
