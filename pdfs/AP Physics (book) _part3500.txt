Protons used to kill tumors have a special property that makes them particu-
larly useful. As shown in Fig. 31–18, when protons enter tissue, most of their
energy is deposited at the end of their path. The protons’ initial kinetic energy
can be chosen so that most of the energy is deposited at the depth of the tumor
itself, to destroy it. The incoming protons deposit only a small amount of energy
in the tissue in front of the tumor, and none at all behind the tumor, thus having
less negative effect on healthy tissue than X- or 
rays. Because tumors have
physical size, even several centimeters in diameter, a range of proton energies is
often used. Heavier ions, such as 
particles or carbon ions, are similarly useful.
This proton therapy technique is more than a half century old, but the necessity
of having a large accelerator has meant that few hospitals have used the tech-
nique until now. Many such “proton centers” are now being built.
