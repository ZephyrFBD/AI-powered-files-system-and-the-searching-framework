sed on the Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium to analyze genetic drift and the effect of selection in
the evolution of specific populations.
You will build a spreadsheet that models how a hypothetical gene pool
changes from one generation to the next. Any modern spreadsheet will
work, including Microsoft Excel, Google’s online Google Docs, and
Zoho’s online spreadsheet. This spreadsheet will let you explore how
different factors, such as selection, mutation, and migration, affect allelic
frequencies in a population.
You will be able to answer questions such as:
Why do recessive alleles like the one that causes cystic fibrosis stay
in the human population?
Why don’t they gradually disappear?
Why is the dominant trait polydactyly not a common trait in human
populations?
How do inheritance patterns or allelic frequencies change in a
population?
