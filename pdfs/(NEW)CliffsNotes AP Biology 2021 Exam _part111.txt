 gradient across a plasma membrane
and without ATP. 9. C. Note that this question asks about water moving down a gradient.
10. B. The movement of urine through the urinary tract is by bulk flow, a collective movement of substances
moving in the same general direction. This is in contrast to diffusion, osmosis, and other molecular motions, in
which the motion of particular molecules with respect to other molecules is being described.
11. A. The energy requirement indicates active transport.
12. D. If the solute concentration is higher outside than inside the cell, water moves out of the cell (by osmosis).
This causes the cell volume to decrease, resulting in plasmolysis, the collapse of the cell. In contrast, cell lysis
occurs when water enters the cell, causing the cell volume to increase to the point where the cell bursts.
13. D. Since the motion of the molecules is random, at any particular moment there are sure to be some molecules
moving against the concentration gradient. It is on
