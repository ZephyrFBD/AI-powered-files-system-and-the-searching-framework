occurs in the cytoplasm, not the mitochondria, so
choice (C) is incorrect. One of the end products of the electron transport chain is metabolic water, but
fermentation does not form metabolic water. So choice (D) is incorrect.
20. (B) Since a few base pairs are lost each time a linear chromosome is replicated, the repetitive telomere
sequences at the ends of linear chromosomes help protect the genetic information in chromosomes from
degradation during cell division. Choice (A) is incorrect because telomeres do not function in protein synthesis.
Telomeres do not correct mutations in DNA, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because
telomeres do not inhibit cell division.
21. (D) Water moves from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water potential. Celery stalks become
stiff after being placed in distilled water for a few hours because water will move from the area of higher water
potential in the distilled water to the area of lower water potential in the ce
