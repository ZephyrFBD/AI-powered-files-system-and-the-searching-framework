s a very 
low electronegativity (0.8, from Figure 8.8, p. 310). As a result, 
the hydrogen in KH carries a negative charge. Thus, KH should 
be the least acidic (most basic) compound in the series.
 
  Arsenic and hydrogen have similar electronegativities, 
2.0 and 2.1, respectively. This means that the As—H bond is 
nonpolar, and so AsH3 has little tendency to donate a proton 
in aqueous solution.
 
  The electronegativity of Se is 2.4, and that of Br is 2.8. 
Consequently, the H ¬Br bond is more polar than the H—Se 
bond, giving HBr the greater tendency to donate a proton. 
(This expectation is conﬁrmed by Figure 16.19, where we see 
that H2Se is a weak acid and HBr a strong acid.) Thus, the 
order of increasing acidity is KH 6 AsH3 6 H2Se 6 HBr.
(b) The acids H2SO4 and H2SeO4 have the same number of O 
atoms and the same number of OH groups. In such cases, the 
acid strength increases with increasing electronegativity of 
the central atom. Because S is slightly more electronegative
