bacterial species found in the rumen 
of cattle. The rumen is a part of the stomach that acts as a fermentation chamber in cattle and other ruminants. 
Shown in the table are the results from before and after an abrupt change in the cattleâ€™s diet. Based on the results, 
which of the following best explains why the initial hypothesis should be revised? 
(A) The diets were too similar, since cellulose and starch are both carbohydrates obtained from eating plants. 
(B) The abundance of one of the bacterial species increased in response to the change in diet. 
(C) The change in the diversity of microorganisms had no observable effect on cattle physiology. 
(D) The ability of rumen fluid to resist changes in pH counteracted the changes in microorganism diversity.
