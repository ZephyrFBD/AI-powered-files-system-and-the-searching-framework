f attraction, called the strong nuclear force, exists between nucleons. Neu-
trons are intimately involved in this attractive force.
All nuclei other than 1
1H contain neutrons. As the number of protons in a nucleus 
increases, there is an ever greater need for neutrons to counteract the protonâ€“proton 
repulsions. Stable nuclei with atomic numbers up to about 20 have approximately equal 
numbers of neutrons and protons. For nuclei with atomic number above 20, the num-
ber of neutrons exceeds the number of protons. Indeed, the number of neutrons neces-
sary to create a stable nucleus increases more rapidly than the number of protons. Thus, 
the neutron-to-proton ratios of stable nuclei increase with increasing atomic number, as 
illustrated by the following isotopes: 12
6C 1n/p = 12, manganese, 55
25Mn 1n/p = 1.202, and 
gold, 197
79Au 1n/p = 1.492.

according to their numbers of protons and neutrons. Notice ho
