 a 3-prong plug; almost
no current goes through the person.
You can get a shock by becoming part of a complete circuit. Figure 19–25
shows two ways the circuit might be completed when you accidentally touch a
“hot” electric wire—“hot” meaning a high potential relative to ground such as
120 V (normal U.S. household voltage) or 240 V (many other countries). The
other wire of building wiring is connected to ground—either by a wire connected
to a buried conductor, or via a metal water pipe into the ground. The current in
Fig. 19–25a passes from the high-voltage wire through you to ground through
your bare feet, and back along the ground (a fair conductor) to the ground ter-
minal of the source. If you stand on a good insulator—thick rubber-soled shoes
or a dry wood floor—there will be much more resistance in the circuit and much
less current through you. If you stand with bare feet on the ground, or in a bathtub,
there is lethal danger because the resistance is much less and the current gr
