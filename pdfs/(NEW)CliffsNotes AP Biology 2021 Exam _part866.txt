1. The plasmid in the following drawing has a length of 12,000 base pairs
(12 kilobase pairs). The arrows indicate the site of digestion for enzymes X and Y. Assume that digestion of the
plasmid by the enzymes is complete.
a. If enzyme X were acting alone, how many fragments would be produced?
b. If enzyme Y were acting alone, how many base pairs would each produced fragment have?
c. If both enzymes X and Y are applied to the plasmid, how many base pairs would each produced fragment have?
A diagram of an electrophoresis gel follows. The digested or undigested DNA samples are loaded into the wells
(shown as rectangles) at the top of the gel. Use the following plot of migration distances for fragments of known
sizes for reference.
d. Draw a horizontal lin
