The valence electrons are the ones in the outermost occupied 
shell, the 2s2 and 2p1 electrons. The 1s2 electrons constitute 
the core electrons, which we represent as 3He4 when we write 
the  
condensed electron configuration, 3He42s22p1.
(c) The 1s and 2s orbitals are both spherical, but they differ in 
three important respects: First, the 1s orbital is lower in energy 
than the 2s orbital. Second, the average distance of the 2s elec-
trons from the nucleus is greater than that of the 1s electrons, 
so the 1s orbital is smaller than the 2s. Third, the 2s orbital has 
one node, whereas the 1s orbital has no nodes (Figure 6.19).
(d) The balanced chemical equation is
2 B1s2 + 3 F21g2 ¡ 2 BF31g2
(e)  ∆H ° = 21-1135.62 - 30 + 04 = -2271.2 kJ. The reaction is 
strongly exothermic.
(f) As we saw in Equation 3.10 (Section 3.3), the mass percent-
age of an element in a substance de
