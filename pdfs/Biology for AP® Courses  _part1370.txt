is a word composed of Greek roots that mean “standing upon.” The alleles that are being masked or
silenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking. Often the biochemical basis of epistasis
is a gene pathway in which the expression of one gene is dependent on the function of a gene that precedes or follows it in
the pathway.
An example of epistasis is pigmentation in mice. The wild-type coat color, agouti (AA), is dominant to solid-colored fur
(aa). However, a separate gene (C) is necessary for pigment production. A mouse with a recessive c allele at this locus is
unable to produce pigment and is albino regardless of the allele present at locus A (Figure 12.20). Therefore, the genotypes
AAcc, Aacc, and aacc all produce the same albino phenotype. A cross between heterozygotes for both genes (AaCc x AaCc)
