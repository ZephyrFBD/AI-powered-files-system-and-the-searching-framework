 in one or more layers at the upper surface, but can occur at
both surfaces of vertically oriented leaves of plants adapted to dry habitats. Bordering the palisades mesophyll is the
spongy mesophyll, consisting of loosely arranged cells with numerous intercellular spaces. Openings in the leaves
that lead to the air spaces are called stomata (singular, stoma). The stomata allow for gas exchange,
taking in CO2 and releasing O2. At the same time, however, the stomata
permit the loss of water through evaporation, or transpiration. As a result, the structure of the leaf is closely
adapted for the growth habit of the plant, balancing the needs of photosynthesis with the costs of transpiration. In
addition, as a tender, nutrient-rich material, leaves are the targets of herbivores. Some mechanisms to deal with these
challenges follow (Figure 12-1):
The cuticle of a leaf is a wax covering that reduces transpiration. Plants that grow in hot or dry habitats often have
thicker cuticles.
