stance gene. Because antibiotic-
resistant bacteria are a growing public health threat, a student tries to
make insulin-producing E. coli using a plasmid that lacks the ampicillin-
resistant gene.
Despite his careful work, why would the student’s experiment be unlikely
to succeed without the ampicillin-resistant gene?
Ampicillin-resistance allows for the production of insulin by
successfully transformed E. coli.
(A)
Ampicillin-resistance allows for the selective growth of only the
successfully transformed E. coli.
(B)
Ampicillin-resistance allows for the insertion of the insulin gene into
the lac operon.
(C)
Ampicillin-resistance has no eﬀect on a recombinant bacteria’s
ability to produce insulin via induction of the lac operon and his
experiment should work.
(D)
58. Tasmanian devils almost became extinct over 10,000 years ago, except for
a small population that remained on Tasmania. This founding population
of devils was leȇ with a smaller gene pool and less genetic variation than
the
