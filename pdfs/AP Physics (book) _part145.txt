2–3 Instantaneous Velocity
If you drive a car along a straight road for 150 km in 2.0 h, the magnitude of
your average velocity is 
It is unlikely, though, that you were moving
at precisely 
at every instant. To describe this situation we need the
concept of instantaneous velocity, which is the velocity at any instant of time.
(Its magnitude is the number, with units, indicated by a speedometer, Fig. 2–8.)
More precisely, the instantaneous velocity at any moment is defined as the
average velocity over an infinitesimally short time interval. That is, Eq. 2–2 is to be
evaluated in the limit of 
becoming extremely small, approaching
