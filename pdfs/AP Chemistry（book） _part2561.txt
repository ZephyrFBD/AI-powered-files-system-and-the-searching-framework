lving calculator or the quadratic formula. We can simplify the problem, 
however, by noting that the value of Ka is quite small. As a result, the equilibrium lies far 
to the left and x is much smaller than the initial concentration of acetic acid. Thus, we 
assume that x is negligible relative to 0.30, so that 0.30 - x is essentially equal to 0.30. We 
can (and should!) check the validity of this assumption when we finish the problem. By 
using this assumption, Equation 16.30 becomes
 
Ka =
x2
0.30 = 1.8 * 10-5 
Solving for x, we have
 
x2 = 10.30211.8 * 10-52 = 5.4 * 10-6
 
x = 25.4 * 10-6 = 2.3 * 10-3
 
3H+4 = x = 2.3 * 10-3 M
 
pH = -log12.3 * 10-32 = 2.64
Now we check the validity of our simplifying assumption that 0.30 - x â‰ƒ0.30. 
The value of x we determined is so small that, for this number of significant figures, the 
assumption is entirely valid. We are thus satisfied that the assumption was a reasonable 
one to make. Because x represents the moles per liter of acetic acid th
