e have a sense of the shapes that molecules adopt and why they do so, we 
will return to some topics that we first discussed in Section 8.4, namely, bond polarity and 
dipole moments. Recall that bond polarity is a measure of how equally the electrons in a 
bond are shared between the two atoms of the bond. As the difference in electronegativ-
ity between the two atoms increases, so does the bond polarity. 
 (Section 8.4) We saw 
that the dipole moment of a diatomic molecule is a measure of the amount of charge 
separation in the molecule.
For a molecule consisting of more than two atoms, the dipole moment depends on both 
the polarities of the individual bonds and the geometry of the molecule. For each bond in the 
molecule, we consider the bond dipole, which is the dipole moment due only to the 
two atoms in that bond. Consider the linear CO2 molecule, for example. As shown in 
Figure 9.10(a), each C “O bond is polar, and because the C “O bonds are identical, the 
bond dipoles are eq
