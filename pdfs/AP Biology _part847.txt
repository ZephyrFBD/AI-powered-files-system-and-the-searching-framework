quare centimeters. To measure the surface area of the
leaf, trace all the leaves from each plant onto graph paper with squares of
known size. Construct a graph with “Total Water Loss (mL/cm2)” on the
y-axis and “Time (min)” on the x-axis, like the graph pictured below.
LAB #12: ANIMAL BEHAVIOR
Introduction
Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, has been studied by
scientists since 1907. It lives throughout the world and feeds on rotting
fruit. Drosophila is a model research organism. Students have been
conducting genetic experiments with these flies for generations. However,
most students today can conduct the classic genetic experiments using
computer simulations instead of real fruit flies. In this experiment, you will
use live fruit flies to study animal behavior.

Objective
You will investigate the relationship between a model organism,
Drosophila, and its response to different environmental conditions.
