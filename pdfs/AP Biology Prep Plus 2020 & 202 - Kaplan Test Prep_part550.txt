f DNA rich in adenine
and thymine tend to separate more easily than those rich in Cs and Gs.
Adenine and thymine form only two hydrogen bonds across the double
helix, while C and G form three. Separation of DNA at the TATA boxes in
the promoter regions of genes allows DNA to unzip at those regions for
RNA polymerase to access the DNA template. Other types of promoters
known as internal promoters can be found within the introns of genes.
These promoters occur especially in genes that encode rRNA and tRNA
molecules.
Elongation
In the elongation stage, RNA polymerase transcribes the DNA template
strand to produce a complementary antiparallel RNA strand. Reading
from the 3′ end of the template strand, RNA polymerase builds an hnRNA
(pre-mRNA) chain in the 5′ to 3′ direction.
Termination
The termination stage occurs when RNA polymerase encounters a
terminator sequence located downstream from the promoter. The
terminator signals RNA polymerase to detach from the template strand
and release t
