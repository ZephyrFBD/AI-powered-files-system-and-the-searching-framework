He takes the example of the ‘novel SARS-Cov2’ virus to prove the
point. First they take someone with an undeﬁned illness called
‘Covid-19’ and don’t even aĴempt to ﬁnd any virus in their sputum.
Never mind the scientists still describe how this ‘virus’, which they
have not located aĴaches to a cell receptor, injects its genetic
material, in ‘Covid’s’ case, RNA, into the cell. The RNA once inserted
exploits the cell to reproduce itself and makes ‘thousands, nay
millions, of copies of itself … Then it emerges victorious to claim its
next victim’:
If you were to look in the scientific literature for proof, actual scientific proof, that uniform
SARS-CoV2 viruses have been properly isolated from the sputum of a sick person, that actual
spike proteins could be seen protruding from the virus (which has not been found), you would
find that such evidence doesn’t exist.
If you go looking in the published scientific literature for actual pictures, proof, that these
spike proteins or any viral p
