discussed below) perform cyclic electron flow instead. Cyclic photophosphorylation is similar to noncyclic, but
generates only ATP, and no NADPH. It takes place only at photosystem I: once an electron is displaced from the
photosystem, it is passed down electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted.
The Light-Independent Reactions
Now let’s turn to the dark side. The dark reactions use the products of the light reactions—ATP and NADPH—to
make sugar. We now have energy to make glucose, but what do plants use as their carbon source? CO2, of course.
You’ve probably heard of the term carbon fixation. All this means is that CO2 from the air is converted into
carbohydrates. This step occurs in the stroma of the leaf. The dark reactions are also called the Calvin-Benson
Cycle (or just Calvin cycle).
Let’s summarize important facts about the dark reactions:
The Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts.
