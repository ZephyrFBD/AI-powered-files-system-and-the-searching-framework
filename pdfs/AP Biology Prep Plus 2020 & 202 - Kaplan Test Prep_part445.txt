little to no eﬀect at this scale, so (D) is
incorrect.
12. A
Learning Objective: 10.4
With a high enough concentration of ATP, breakdown of ATP would be
favored. This would cause the pumping of hydrogen ions against their
concentration gradient, matching (A). (B) is incorrect because the
energy released from ATP hydrolysis would drive hydrogen ions up
their concentration gradient. (C) is incorrect because hydrogen ions
cannot pass through the enzyme without spinning the rotor and
causing a reaction. (D) is incorrect as both ATP synthesis and the
movement of hydrogen ions up their concentration are energy
requiring processes and could not occur together.
