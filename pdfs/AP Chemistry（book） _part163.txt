The densities of solids and liquids are commonly expressed in either grams per 
cubic centimeter 1g>cm32 or grams per milliliter 1g>mL2. The densities of some com-
mon substances are listed in Table 1.5. It is no coincidence that the density of water 
is 1.00 g>mL; the gram was originally defined as the mass of 1 mL of water at a spe-
cific temperature. Because most substances change volume when they are heated or 
cooled, densities are temperature dependent, and so temperature should be specified 
when reporting densities. If no temperature is reported, we assume 25 °C, close to 
normal room temperature.
The terms density and weight are sometimes confused. A person who says that iron 
weighs more than air generally means that iron
