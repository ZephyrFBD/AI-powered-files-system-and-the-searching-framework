O2 
would not be as vigorous. Depending on how hot it is, it might not 
burn at all. Figure 14.2 Our first guess might be half way between 
the values at 20 s and 40 s, namely 0.42 mol A. However, we also see 
that the change in the number of moles of A between 0 s and 20 s is 
same molecular weights. Thus, the change in boiling point moving 
left to right is due mainly to the increasing dipole-dipole attrac-
tions. Figure 11.9 Both compounds are nonpolar and incapable 
of forming hydrogen bonds. Therefore, the boiling point is deter-
mined by the dispersion forces, which are stronger for the larger, 
heavier AsH3. Figure 11.10 The non-hydrogen atom must possess 
a nonbonding electron pair. Figure 11.11 There are four electron 
pairs surrounding oxygen in a water molecule. Two of the electron 
pairs are used to make covalent bonds to hydrogen within the H2O 
molecule, while the other two are available to make hydrogen bonds 
to neighboring molecules. Because the electron-pair geometry
