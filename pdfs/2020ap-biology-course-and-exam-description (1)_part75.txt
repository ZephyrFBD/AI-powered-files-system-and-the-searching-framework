elices 
and beta-sheets, tertiary structure that is 
the overall three-dimensional shape of the 
protein and often minimizes free energy, 
and quaternary structure that arises from 
interactions between multiple polypeptide 
units. The four elements of protein structure 
determine the function of a protein. 
e.	Carbohydrates comprise linear chains of 
sugar monomers connected by covalent 
bonds. Carbohydrate polymers may be linear 
or branched.
