ntensive, involving numerous 
psychometric analyses of the results of a specific AP Exam in a specific year and 
of the particular group of students who took that exam. Additionally, to ensure 
alignment with college-level standards, part of the score-setting process involves 
comparing the performance of AP students with the performance of students

equivalent to college grades of A–, B+, and B. AP Exam scores of 3 are equivalent 
to college grades of B–, C+, and C.
