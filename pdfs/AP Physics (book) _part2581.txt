23–9 Combinations of Lenses
Many optical instruments use lenses in combination. When light passes through
more than one lens, we find the image formed by the first lens as if it were alone.
Then this image becomes the object for the second lens. Next we find the image 
formed by this second lens using the first image as object. This second image is
the final image if there are only two lenses. The total magnification will be the
product of the separate magnifications of each lens. Even if the second lens inter-
