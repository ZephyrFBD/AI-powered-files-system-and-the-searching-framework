flasks and together in one flask. Which of the following
statements best explains the difference in growth?
(A) P. aurelia produces toxic waste which harms both species, but harms P. caudatum more.
(B) P. aurelia outcompetes P. caudatum for resources when they are grown in the same flask.
(C) P. aurelia has a higher reproductive rate than P. caudatum.
(D) When grown in the same flask, the two species reproduce, creating a hybrid and thus decreasing the
number of both species.
Question 2 refers to the following information.
The effects of the hormone known as growth hormone (GH) are mediated via the GH receptor (GHR).
GHR is a 620-amino acid type I transmembrane protein that is expressed at high levels in liver and
adipose (fat) tissue. The GHR extracellular region, where the hormone binds, contains seven cysteine
residues, of which six are paired through disulfide bridges. GH binding causes the activation of the
tyrosine kinase enzyme called Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) in the cell. Activated
