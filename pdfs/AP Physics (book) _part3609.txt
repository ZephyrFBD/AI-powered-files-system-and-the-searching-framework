k interaction.
Thus, strange particles were forbidden by strangeness conservation to decay to
nonstrange particles of lower mass via the strong interaction, but could decay by
means of the weak interaction at the observed longer lifetimes of 
to 
The conservation of strangeness was the first example of a partially conserved
quantity. In this case, the quantity strangeness is conserved by strong interactions
but not by weak.
Guess the missing particle. Using the
conservation laws for particle interactions, determine the possibilities for the
missing particle in the reaction
in addition to 
mentioned above.
RESPONSE We write equations for the conserved numbers in this reaction,
with B,
S, and Q as unknowns whose determination will reveal what the
possible particle might be:
The unknown product particle would have to have these characteristics:
In addition to 
a neutral sigma particle,
is also consistent with these
numbers.
In the next Section we will discuss another partially conserved q
