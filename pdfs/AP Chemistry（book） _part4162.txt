al numbers of electrons and protons. (b) 
The protons reside in the nucleus of the atom. page 53 The mass 
of an electron is 5.5 * 10 - 4 amu, so you would need to express 
the mass of an oxygen atom to four places past the decimal, giving 
a total of six significant figures, to detect a change in mass upon 
losing an electron. page 53 The atomic weight of boron, 10.811 
amu, is closer to 11B which means 11B is the more abundant iso-
tope.  pageÂ 57 (a) Cl, (b) third period and group 7A, (c) 17,  
(d) nonmetal page 59 B2H6 and C4H2O2 can be only molecular 
formulas; their empirical formulas would be BH3 and C2HO. SO2 and 
CH could be empirical formulas or molecular formulas. No formula 
can be only an empirical formula; there could always be a molecule 
of that composition page 60 (a) C2H6, (b) CH3, (c) No, you cannot 
determine bond angles or relative bond distances from a structural 
formula. page 64 WO3 page 66 MnO page 67 The endings
