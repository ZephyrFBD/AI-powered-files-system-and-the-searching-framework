26. Which of the following claims is best supported 
by the experimental results? 
(A) Light is required for the electron transport 
chain to transfer electrons. 
(B) Water, not carbon dioxide, is the source of 
electrons used in the light-dependent 
reaction of photosynthesis. 
(C) Carbon dioxide is the source of carbon 
used by green plants to build 
carbohydrates. 
(D) DCPIP provides a significant source of 
electrons to the electron transport chain of 
the light reaction in the absence of light. 
27. Which of the following best explains how 
DCMU affected the reaction? 
(A) DCMU acts as a second buffer in the 
reaction. 
(B) DCMU acts as an additional carrier of 
electrons from photosy
