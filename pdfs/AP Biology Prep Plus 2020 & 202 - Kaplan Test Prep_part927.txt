3. A scientist conducts an experiment with penicillin-sensitive
bacteria in which he adds a plasmid containing a gene that
confers penicillin resistance. Following a protocol that elicits
normal growth and uptake of the plasmid DNA, the scientist then
adds bacteria to four new plates, as shown here.
DescribeÂ plasmids and their involvement in passing hereditary
information from generation to generation.
(a)
Identify the protocol the scientist likely used to encourage the
uptake of the plasmid DNA.
(b)
Predict the growth patterns the scientist should expect to see
on the plates.
(c)
Justify your prediction.

4. During late summer and early fall, bats increase their body fat
from approximately 10% to 30% in preparation for hibernation.
White-nose syndrome (WNS), which causes over-winter mortality,
first appeared in the United States in the winter of 2007. Caused
by infection with the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd.),
WNS disrupts torpor patterns an
