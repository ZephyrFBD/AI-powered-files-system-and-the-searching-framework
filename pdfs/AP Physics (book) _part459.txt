 5–2c;
will be essentially
perpendicular to them. Thus 
points toward the center of the circle. Since 
by definition, is in the same direction as 
(equation above), it too must point
toward the center of the circle. Therefore, this acceleration is called centripetal
acceleration (“center-pointing” acceleration) or radial acceleration (since it is
directed along the radius, toward the center of the circle), and we denote it by 
Now that we have determined the direction, next we find the magnitude of the
radial (centripetal) acceleration,
Because the line CA in Fig. 5–2a is perpen-
dicular to 
and line CB is perpendicular to 
then the angle 
between CA and
CB is also the angle between 
and 
Hence the vectors 
and 
in 
Fig. 5–2b form a triangle that is geometrically similar† to triangle ACB in Fig. 5–2a.
If we take 
to be very small (letting 
be very small) and set 
because the magnitude of the velocity is assumed not to change, we can write
This is an exact equality when 
approaches zero
