e 1. Blood lactate levels during underwater dives 
5. 
 Many aquatic animals can hold their breath and dive underwater for long periods of time. During long dives,  
lactic acid builds up in tissues of the organism. The graph above shows blood lactate levels following dives of  
different duration for three species. Lactate is produced when lactic acid is dissolved in the blood and becomes  
ionized.  
(a) Based on the data, propose a hypothesis to explain the change in blood lactate levels in Weddell seals for 
dives lasting longer than 20 minutes.  
(b)  Describe the most likely shape of the curve if blood oxygen levels of Weddell seals were plotted rather than 
blood lactate levels. Include in your description the likely shape of the curve between 0 and 20 minutes and 
the shape of the curve after 20 minutes. 
(c) The data suggest that Baikal seals can sustain much longer dives than Emperor penguins. Propose a 
hypothesis that could explain the evolution of different dive responses
