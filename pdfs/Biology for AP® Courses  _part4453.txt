Communication within a Species
Animals communicate with each other using stimuli known as signals. An example of this is seen in the three-spined
stickleback, where the visual signal of a red region in the lower half of a fish signals males to become aggressive and signals
females to mate. Other signals are chemical (pheromones), aural (sound), visual (courtship and aggressive displays), or
tactile (touch). These types of communication may be instinctual or learned or a combination of both. These are not the
same as the communication we associate with language, which has been observed only in humans and perhaps in some
species of primates and cetaceans.
A pheromone is a secreted chemical signal used to obtain a response from another individual of the same species. The
purpose of pheromones is to elicit a specific behavior from the receiving individual. Pheromones are especially common
among social insects, but they are used
