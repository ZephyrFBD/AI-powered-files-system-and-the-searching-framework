Learning Objective: 6.6
E. coli bacteria are single-celled organisms that reproduce easily with
very short generation times, allowing for many generations of
oﬀspring to emerge in a relatively short time. This makes them prime
candidates for the study of genetic transformations. (A) is thus correct.
(B), (C), and (D) are all complex eukaryotic organisms that reproduce
sexually with longer generation times than bacteria, making it more
diﬀicult to study the impact of a transformed gene across generations.
2. B
Learning Objective: 6.2
If a cell loses its ability to function and cannot be repaired, then it
could lyse (burst open) or undergo apoptosis (programmed cellular
death). Whether it does either depends on the severity of the damage
to the cell. (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because the cell will
remain intact if it is capable of repairing the damage. (C) and (D) are
incorrect because they only present one of the two viable options for a
damaged c
