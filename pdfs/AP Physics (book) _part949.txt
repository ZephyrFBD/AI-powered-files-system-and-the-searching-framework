9–4 Stability and Balance
An object in static equilibrium, if left undisturbed, will undergo no translational
or rotational acceleration since the sum of all the forces and the sum of all the
torques acting on it are zero. However, if the object is displaced slightly, three
outcomes are possible: (1) the object returns to its original position, in which case
it is said to be in stable equilibrium; (2) the object moves even farther from its orig-
inal position, and it is said to be in unstable equilibrium; or (3) the object remains
in its new position, and it is said to be in neutral equilibrium.
Consider the followin
