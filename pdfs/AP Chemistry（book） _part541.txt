CHAPTER 4 Reactions in Aqueous Solution
When a molecular compound such as sucrose or methanol [Figure 4.3(b)] dissolves 
in water, the solution usually consists of intact molecules dispersed throughout the solu-
tion. Consequently, most molecular compounds are nonelectrolytes. A few molecular 
substances do have aqueous solutions that contain ions. Acids are the
