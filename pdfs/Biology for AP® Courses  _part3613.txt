 the lung tissue cannot bend and move.
In these types of restrictive diseases, the intrapleural pressure is more positive and the airways collapse upon exhalation,
which traps air in the lungs. Forced or functional vital capacity (FVC), which is the amount of air that can be forcibly
exhaled after taking the deepest breath possible, is much lower than in normal patients, and the time it takes to exhale most
of the air is greatly prolonged (Figure 30.18). A patient suffering from these diseases cannot exhale the normal amount of
air.
Obstructive diseases and conditions include emphysema, asthma, and pulmonary edema. In emphysema, which mostly
arises from smoking tobacco, the walls of the alveoli are destroyed, decreasing the surface area for gas exchange. The
overall compliance of the lungs is increased, because as the alveolar walls are damaged, lung elastic recoil decreases due to a
loss of elastic fibers, and more air is trapped in the lungs at the end of exhalation. Asthma is a dise
