Which of the following conclusions can be reasonably drawn from
the data provided in the table?
The composition of phospholipids in the membrane is not
correlated to ambient temperature.
(A)
Bacteria that thrive in cold environments adapt by increasing
membrane rigidity.
(B)
The membranes of G. stearothermophilus are adapted to
increase fluidity at high temperatures.
(C)
Fatty acids in B. psychrophilus allow the membrane to
maintain its fluidity at low temperatures.
(D)
4. The alveoli of the lungs are sac-like structures where gas
exchanges take place during respiration. Oxygen and carbon
dioxide are small, hydrophobic gases. Two diﬀerent groups of
investigators report diﬀerent kinetics for oxygen movement
across the epithelium. Which of the above graphs is most li
