intensity is a limiting factor of photosynthesis at low light intensity.
Carbon dioxide has the same eﬀect, so at low carbon dioxide
concentrations, carbon dioxide is a limiting factor of photosynthesis.
Therefore, (B) is correct. (A) is incorrect because, at low
concentrations, carbon dioxide and the rate of photosynthesis are
directly related. (C) and (D) are incorrect because, at high
concentrations, carbon dioxide does not aﬀect the rate of
photosynthesis.

Metabolism of glucose to lactate generates only 2 ATP per molecule of
glucose, whereas oxidative phosphorylation generates up to 36 ATP
per molecule of glucose. Thus, a high rate of glucose uptake is required
to meet the cancer cell’s energy needs using this less eﬀicient method,
making (B) correct. (A) is incorrect because the cancer cells convert
glucose to lactic acid (normally an anaerobic process) via aerobic
glycolysis (glycolysis in the presence of oxygen), which only generates
2 ATP per
