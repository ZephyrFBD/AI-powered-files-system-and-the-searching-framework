the cell. For example, when bacteria invade the human
body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil will remove the invaders by this process. Similarly, in pinocytosis
or “cell drinking,” the cell takes in droplets of liquid. In receptor-mediated endocytosis, uptake of substances by the
cell is targeted to a single type of substance that binds to a specific receptor protein on the external surface of the cell
membrane (e.g., hormones and their target cells) before under going endocytosis. Some human diseases, such as familial
hypercholesterolemia, are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Exocytosis is the process of exporting
