central car-
bon). For historical reasons, the two enantiomeric forms of amino acids are often dis-
tinguished by the labels d (from the Latin dexter, “right”) and l (from the Latin laevus, 
“left”). Nearly all the chiral amino acids found in living organisms have the l configu-
ration at the chiral center. The principal exceptions are the proteins that make up the 
cell walls of bacteria, which can contain considerable quantities of the d isomers.
Polypeptides and Proteins
Amino acids are linked together into proteins by amide groups (Table 24.6):

Each amide group is called a peptide bond when it is formed by amino acids. A pep-
tide bond is formed by a condensation reaction between the carboxyl group of one 
amino acid and the amino group of another amino acid. Alanine and glycine, for exam-
ple, form the dipeptide glycylalanine:
