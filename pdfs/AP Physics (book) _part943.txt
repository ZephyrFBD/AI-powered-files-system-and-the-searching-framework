d at the joint by the bone in the upper arm (all
assumed to act vertically). We wish to find the magnitude of 
which can be done
using the torque equation and by choosing our axis through the joint so that 
contributes zero torque.
SOLUTION (a) We calculate torques about the point where 
acts in Fig.9â€“13a.
The
equation gives
We solve for 
(b) The lever arm, as calculated about the joint, is reduced by the factor 
for all three forces. Our torque equation will look like the one just above, except
that each term will have its lever arm reduced by the same factor, which will
cancel out. The same result is obtained,
NOTE The force required of the muscle (400 N) is quite large compared to the
weight of the object lifted
Indeed, the muscles and joints of the
body are generally subjected to quite large forces.
NOTE Forces exerted on joints can be large and even painful or injurious. Using
we calculate for this case
The point of insertion of a muscle varies from person to person. A slight
