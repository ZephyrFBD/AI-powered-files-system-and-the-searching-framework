ntrol of breathing is part of the
medulla oblongata.
D. Create a visual representation of system composed
only of the cortex, the medulla oblongata, the heart and the
lungs. Using arrows describe the flow of information.
Consider “holding your breath” in creating your
representation. Consider why you always stop holding
your breath eventually. Consider “holding your heart.”
Experimental data on the voluntary control of heart rate by
people who practice yoga have been reported
(Raghavendra et al., International Journal of Yoga, 6,
2013; Telles et al., Integrative Physiological and
Behavioral Science, 39, 2004).
E. Analyze the data provided in the following sketch of
blood flow, a process controlled by the autonomic nervous
system, in the two ears of a rabbit (after Blessing, Trends
in Neuroscience, 20, 1997) in terms of cognitive
integration of the response to the stimulus provided by
touching the rabbit.
