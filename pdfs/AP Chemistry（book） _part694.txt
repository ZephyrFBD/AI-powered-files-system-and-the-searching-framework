s. An insulated thermos containing hot coffee approximates an isolated 
system. We know, however, that the coffee eventually cools, so it is not perfectly isolated.

If the H2 and O2 molecules in the 
cylinder react to form H2O, will the 
number of molecules in the cylinder 
change? Will the mass in the cylinder 
change?
System 5 H2(g) and O2(g)
Surroundings 5 cylinder,
piston, and everything beyond
Matter cannot enter 
or leave system.
Energy can enter or 
leave system as heat or 
as work done on piston.

Give It Some Thought
Is a human being an isolated, closed, or open system?
Internal Energy
The internal energy, E, of a system is the sum of all the kinetic and potential energies 
of the components of the system. For the system in Figure 5.4, for example, the internal 
energy includes not only the motions and interactions of the H2 and O2 molecules but 
also the motions and interactions of their component nuclei and electrons. We generally 
do n
