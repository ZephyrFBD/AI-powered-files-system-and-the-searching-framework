vide the same total heat capacity as 1.7 * 103 gal of water?
 5.106 A coffee-cup calorimeter of the type shown in Figure 5.18 
contains 150.0 g of water at 25.1 °C. A 121.0-g block of cop-
per metal is heated to 100.4 °C by putting it in a beaker of 
boiling water. The specific heat of Cu(s) is 0.385 J>g@K. The 
Cu is added to the calorimeter, and after a time the contents 
of the cup reach a constant temperature of 30.1 °C. (a) De-
termine the amount of heat, in J, lost by the copper block. 
 
(b) Determine the amount of heat gained by the water. The 
specific heat of water is 4.18 J>g@K. (c) The difference be-
tween your answers for (a) and (b) is due to heat loss through 
the Styrofoam® cups and the heat necessary to raise the tem-
perature of the inner wall of the apparatus. The heat capacity 
of the calorimeter is the amount of heat necessary to raise 
the temperature of the apparatus (the cups and the stopper) 
by 1 K. Calculate the heat capacity of the calorimeter in J>K.
