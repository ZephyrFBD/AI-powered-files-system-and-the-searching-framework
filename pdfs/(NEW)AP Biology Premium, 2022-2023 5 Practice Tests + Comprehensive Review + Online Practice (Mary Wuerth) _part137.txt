e number of transport proteins for the molecule in the cell membrane. The rate of
simple diffusion is not limited by the number of transport proteins in the cell membrane and will continue to
increase as the concentration difference across the cell membrane increases. In the experiment, as the
concentration of each molecule in the beaker increases, the amount of molecule A entering the cell
continues to increase, but at higher concentrations, the amount of molecule B entering the cell no longer
increases. This indicates that molecule B is likely using a transport protein to enter the cell and is therefore
using facilitated diffusion.
(d) Since molecule A is simply diffusing across the membrane, the addition of a molecule that binds to
transport proteins will likely have no effect on the data for molecule A. However, since molecule B requires
a transport protein to enter the cell, the addition of this new molecule would likely prevent molecule B from
entering the cell.
