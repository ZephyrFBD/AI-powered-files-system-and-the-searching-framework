in 
solutions of high osmolarity because of the 
reduced amount of ATP produced from 
cellular respiration. 
(D) In an isosmotic salt solution, there is no 
diffusion of water into or out of the 
paramecia, so the contraction rate is zero.

A student placed 20 tobacco seeds of the same species on moist paper towels in each of two petri dishes. Dish A  
was wrapped completely in an opaque cover to exclude all light. Dish B was not wrapped. The dishes were placed 
equidistant from a light source set to a cycle of 14 hours of light and 10 hours of dark. All other conditions were the 
same for both dishes. The dishes were examined after 7 days and the opaque cover was permanently removed from 
dish A. Both dishes were returned to the light and examined again at 14 days. The following data were obtained.
