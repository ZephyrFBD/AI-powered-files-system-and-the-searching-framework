population when ciprofloxacin
exposure occurred.
(A)
The proportion of ciprofloxacin-resistant Camplobacter
remained constant in the population as more patients with
diarrhoeal disease were treated with ciprofloxacin.
(B)
Treatment with ciprofloxacin caused a decrease in
Camplobacter growth and division, resulting in a greater
proportion of ciprofloxacin resistance in the population.
(C)
New strains of Camplobacter unexposed to ciprofloxacin
were constantly introduced to the population.
(D)
9. Sickle cell disease is an inherited group of blood disorders that
results in the production of abnormal hemoglobin, which causes
red blood cells to become distorted into a sickle shape. These
cells are very fragile and rupture easily, leading to anemia and
eventually death, if not managed properly. Additionally, these
irregularly shaped cells can cause blockages within blood vessels,
leading to pain and organ failure. To develop the disease, a person
must inherit two mutated copies of the hemoglo
