15.19 Which of the following statements are true and which are 
false? (a) The equilibrium constant can never be a negative 
number. (b) In reactions that we draw with a single-headed 
arrow, the equilibrium constant has a value that is very 
close to zero. (c) As the value of the equilibrium constant 
increases, the speed at which a reaction reaches equilibrium 
increases.
 15.20 Which of the following statements are true and which are 
false? (a) For the reaction 2 A1g2 + B1g2 ∆ A2B1g2 Kc 
and Kp are numerically the same. (b) It is possible to 
distinguish Kc from Kp by comparing the units used to 
express the equilibrium constant. (
