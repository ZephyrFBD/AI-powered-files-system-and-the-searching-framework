 does work on a nail 
it drives into wood. In either case, a moving object exerts a force on a second
object which undergoes a displacement. An object in motion has the ability to 
do work and thus can be said to have energy. The energy of motion is called
kinetic energy, from the Greek word kinetikos, meaning “motion.”
To obtain a quantitative definition for kinetic energy, let us consider a simple
rigid object of mass m (treated as a particle) that is moving in a straight line with an
initial speed 
To accelerate it uniformly to a speed 
a constant net force 
is exerted on it parallel to its motion over a displacement d, Fig. 6–7. Then the net
work done on the object is  
We apply Newton’s second law,
and use Eq. 2–11c  
which we rewrite as
where 
is the initial speed and 
is the final speed. Substituting this into
we determine the work done:
or

We define the quantity 
to be the translational kinetic energy (KE) of the object:

(We call this “translational” kinetic energy
