 to the square of the number of
cells. Add a third annotation to describe an interval of
time where the rate of growth is zero.
D. Select and justify two measurements of the E. coli
population that could be made at two different points in
time during growth that would be sufficient to answer
questions about the population size at any time.
E. Describe the population of E. coli if the environment
was continuously supplement by additional nutrient broth.
120. The following problem extends the Hardy-Weinberg
model of population dynamics that was covered in Chapter
19. It applies mathematics that would be appropriate after
a second course in Algebra. While the concept applied in
this problem are within the scope of the Exam the
mathematical representations are not and the item is
provided to allow students who are able another look at the
concepts.
The Hardy-Weinberg model of population dynamics is an
algebraic representation of the relationships among
genotype frequencies, F, and the prob
