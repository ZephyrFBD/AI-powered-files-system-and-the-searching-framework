The graphite anode contains layers of carbon 
atoms (black spheres). Li+ can move in and 
out of the space between the layers.
The cathode contains cobalt oxide layers (blue 
spheres = Co, red spheres = O). Li+ can move 
in and out of the space between the layers.

▲ Figure 20.21 Schematic of a Li-ion battery. When the battery is discharging (operating), Li+ ions  
move out of the anode and migrate through the electrolyte where they enter the spaces between the  
cobalt oxide layers, reducing the cobalt ions. To recharge the battery, electrical energy is used to  
drive the Li+ back to the anode, oxidizing the cobalt ions in the cathode.
There has been a tremendous growth over the last two decades in 
the development of electric vehicles. This growth has been driven by 
a desire to reduce the use of fossil fuels and lower emissions. Today
