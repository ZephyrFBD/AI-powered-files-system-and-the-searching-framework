and a prey is unlikely to fill the role of a 
predator.
(B)
This option is incorrect. Not all organisms utilize oxygen to harness free energy 
from organic compounds. Fermentation and anaerobic respiration provide a 
mechanism by which some cells can oxidize organic fuel and generate ATP 
without the use of oxygen. Thus, aerobic respiration is not a universal mechanism 
for harnessing energy from organic compounds.
(C)
This option is correct. It demonstrates an understanding that all organisms, 
both extant and extinct, share a universal genetic code with the justification 
that the hereditary information encoded in DNA directs the development 
of biochemical, anatomical, and physiological traits by the fundamental 
processes of replication, transcription, and translation. Through the process 
of transformation, genetic information from one organism can change the 
genotype and phenotype of another organism, thus providing additional 
evidence for the universality of the genetic code.
