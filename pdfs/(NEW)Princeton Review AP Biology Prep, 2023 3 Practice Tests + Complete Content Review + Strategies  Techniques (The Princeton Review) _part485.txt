 and that her sample size is
large enough to be meaningful.
(d) ​ More data allows for more confident conclusions. The researcher could therefore take more pictures from each
slide to increase the sample size.
Chi-Square (χ2) Tests
A chi-square test is a statistical tool used to measure the difference between observed and expected data. For
example, suppose you roll a die 120 times. You would expect a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio between all the numbers that come
up. In other words, you would expect to see each side 20 times. However, because this is an experiment and the
sample size is only 120, you will probably see some variation in the data. If you rolled 24 sixes for example, the
disagreement between observed (24) and expected (20) is small, and could have occurred by chance. If you rolled 40
sixes, however, there is a large disagreement from the expected. Maybe it is a weighted die. The region in between
these two values is trickier. Where is the line drawn between expected/normal variation
