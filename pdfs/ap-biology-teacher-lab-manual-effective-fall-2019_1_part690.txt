ce, volume, and/or mass using the metric system 
•  Estimating leaf surface area 
•  Using a microscope to examine cell structure 
•  Constructing data tables and graphs 
•  Communicating results and conclusions 
If students have not acquired these skills previously, the procedures in this lab will help 
them develop them.

■ Skills Development 
Students will develop the following skills: 
•  Preparing a stomatal peel using nail polish 
•  Making a wet mount of leaf epidermal tissue for microscopy 
•  Calculating leaf surface area and number of stomata/surface area 
•  Assembling a potometer 
•  Calculating transpiration rates 
•  If equipment is available, learning how to use a gas pressure sensor and computer 
interface 
■ Potential Challenges 
If students have a solid understanding of the aforementioned concepts, they should be 
able to select an environmental variable and design an experiment around the effect of 
the var
