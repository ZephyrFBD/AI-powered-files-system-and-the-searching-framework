alleles. Here are a couple of examples of non-Mendelian forms of inheritance:
Incomplete dominance (blending inheritance): In some cases, the traits will blend. For example, if you cross
a white snapdragon plant (genotype WW) with a red snapdragon plant (RR), the resulting progeny will be pink
(RW). In other words, neither color is dominant over the other.
Codominance: Sometimes you’ll see an equal expression of both alleles. For example, an individual can have
an AB blood type. In this case, each allele is equally expressed. That is, both the A allele and the B allele are
expressed (IAIB). That’s why the person is said to have AB blood. The expression of one allele does not prevent
the expression of the other.
Polygenic inheritance: In some cases, a trait results from the interaction of many genes. Each gene will have a
small effect on a particular trait. Height, skin color, and weight are all examples of polygenic traits.
Non-nuclear inheritance: Apart from the genetic material held
