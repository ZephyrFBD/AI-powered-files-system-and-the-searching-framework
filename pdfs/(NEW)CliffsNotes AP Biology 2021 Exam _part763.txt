Think of water potential as potential energy, the ability to do work. The water at the top of a dam has a high water
potential, a high potential energy, and a large capacity for doing work, such as the ability to generate electricity as it
runs downhill.
Part I: Cell Surface Area
This part of the investigation examines the effect of surface area and cell size on the rate of diffusion. You cut up
agar or gelatin that has been soaked in phenolphthalein into pieces of different sizes to model (represent) cells. Then
you immerse the “cells” into a solution of NaOH, which turns phenolphthalein red. Cutting the “cells” in half
reveals how far the NaOH has diffused.
For each size or shape “cell,” the depth to which the NaOH (or red color) diffuses will be about the same for the
same amount of time. But the smaller the “cell,” the sooner the NaOH will reach its center. A calculation of the
surface area-to-volume ratio (S/V
