BIG IDEA 2: ENERGETICS (ENE)
Biological systems use energy and molecular building blocks to grow, 
reproduce, and maintain dynamic homeostasis. Cells and organisms 
must exchange matter with the environment. Organisms respond to 
changes in their environment at the molecular, cellular, physiological, and 
behavioral levels. Living systems require energy and matter to maintain 
order, grow, and reproduce. Organisms employ various strategies 
to capture, use, and store energy and other vital resources. Energy 
deficiencies are not only detrimental to individual organisms but they can 
cause disruptions at the population and ecosystem levels. Homeostatic 
mechanisms that are conserved or divergent across related organisms 
reflect either continuity due to com
