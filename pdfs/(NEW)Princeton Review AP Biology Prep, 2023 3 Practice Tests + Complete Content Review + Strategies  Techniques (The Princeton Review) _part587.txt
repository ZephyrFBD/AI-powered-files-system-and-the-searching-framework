ency. Since the ratio is (2πrh + 2πr2) / πr2h, this simplifies to 2/r + 2/h, so if the radius or height is higher,
the ratio is smaller. Therefore, the smallest radius and height, (A), gives the highest ratio of 5.33 and the
highest efficiency.
30. C
Helicase is the enzyme that unwinds the helix. The closed helix would exist without helicase.
31. C
The RNA polymerase is not bound, but there is a bound repressor. The transcription must be repressed.
32. D
These four phases must be transcription. Transcription begins with a closed helix, then an enhancer binds, and
then RNA polymerase is seen making RNA. Finally, the closed helix and the completed mRNA strand exist.
33. B
Photosynthesis requires light, carbon dioxide, and water and produces oxygen and glucose.
34. B
The only conclusion possible from this particular experiment is that DNA is the hereditary material. The other
conclusions were not tested here.
35. C
Translation, the synthesis of proteins from mRNA, occurs in the cytoplasm.
