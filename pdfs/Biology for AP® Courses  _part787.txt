e groups that can be removed by hydrolysis to form ADP
(adenosine diphosphate) or AMP (adenosine monophosphate).The negative charges on the phosphate group naturally
repel each other, requiring energy to bond them together and releasing energy when these bonds are broken.
The addition of a phosphate group to a molecule requires energy. Phosphate groups are negatively charged and thus repel
one another when they are arranged in series, as they are in ADP and ATP. This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP
molecules inherently unstable. The release of one or two phosphate groups from ATP, a process called dephosphorylation,
releases energy.
Energy from ATP
Hydrolysis is the process of breaking complex macromolecules apart. During hydrolysis, water is split, or lysed, and the
resulting hydrogen atom (H+) and a hydroxyl group (OH-) are added to the larger molecule. The hydrolysis of ATP produces
ADP, together with an inorganic phosphate ion (Pi), and the release of free energy. To carry out life
