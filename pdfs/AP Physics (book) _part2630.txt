he wave front AB
in Fig. 24–1, which is traveling away from a source S. We assume the medium is
isotropic—that is, the speed 
of the waves is the same in all directions. To find
the wave front a short time t after it is at AB, tiny circles are drawn at points
along AB with radius 
The centers of these tiny circles are shown as blue
dots on the original wave front AB, and the circles represent Huygens’ (imaginary)
wavelets. The tangent to all these wavelets, the curved line CD, is the new
position of the wave front after a time .
Huygens’ principle is particularly useful for analyzing what happens when
waves run into an obstacle and the wave fronts are partially interrupted.
Huygens’ principle predicts that waves bend in behind an obstacle, as shown in
Fig. 24–2. This is just what water waves do, as we saw in Chapter 11 (Figs. 11–45
and 11–46). The bending of waves behind obstacles into the “shadow region” is
known as diffraction. Since diffraction occurs for waves, but not for particle
