FIGURE 19–13 Currents can be
calculated using Kirchhoff’s rules.
See Example 19–8.
Using Kirchhoff’s rules. Calculate the currents 
and
in the three branches of the circuit in Fig.19–13 (which is the same as Fig.19–11).
APPROACH and SOLUTION
1. Label the currents and their directions. Figure 19–13 uses the labels 
and 
for the current in the three separate branches. Since (positive) current
tends to move away from the positive terminal of a battery, we choose 
and
to have the directions shown in Fig. 19–13. The direction of 
is not obvious
in advance, so we arbitrarily chose the direction indicated. If the current
actually flows in the opposite direction, our answer will have a negative sign.
