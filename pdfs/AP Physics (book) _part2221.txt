. Such an
iron-core solenoid is an electromagnet.
Electromagnets have many practical applications, from use in motors and
generators to producing large magnetic fields for research. Sometimes an iron
core is not present—the magnetic field then comes only from the current in the
wire coils. A large field B in this case requires a large current I, which produces a
large amount of waste heat 
But if the current-carrying wires are made
of superconducting material kept below the transition temperature (Section 18–9),
very high fields can be produced, and no electric power is needed to maintain 
the large current in the superconducting coils. Energy is required, however, to
refrigerate the coils at the low temperatures where they superconduct.

Another useful device consists of a solenoid into which a rod of iron is
partially inserted. This combination is also referred to as a so
