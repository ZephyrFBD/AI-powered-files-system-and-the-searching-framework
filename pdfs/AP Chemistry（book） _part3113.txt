undings depend on the path of the process?
 19.15  Consider the vaporization of liquid water to steam at a 
pressure of 1 atm. (a) Is this process endothermic or exo-
thermic? (b) In what temperature range is it a spontaneous 
process? (c) In what temperature range is it a nonsponta-
neous process? (d) At what temperature are the two phases 
in equilibrium?
 19.16  The normal freezing point of n-octane 1C8H182 is -57 Â°C. 
(a) Is the freezing of n-octane an endothermic or exother-
mic process? (b) In what temperature range is the freezing 
of n-octane a spontaneous process? (c) In what tempera-
ture range is it a nonspontaneous process? (d) Is there any 
temperature at which liquid n-octane and solid n-octane 
are in equilibrium? Explain.
 19.17  Consider a process in which an ideal gas changes from 
state 1 to state 2 in such a way that its temperature changes 
from 300 K to 200 K. (a) Does the temperature change 
depend on whether the process is reversible or irrevers-
ible? (b) Is th
