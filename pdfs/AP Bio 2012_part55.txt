 phenotypes of the flowers arising 
from the pink and white cross can best be 
explained by another gene product that 
influences the phenotypic expression.

Questions 51-53  
Both myoglobin and hemoglobin are proteins that 
bind reversibly with molecular oxygen. The graph 
below shows the oxygen-binding saturation of each 
protein at different concentrations of oxygen. 
 
 
 
51. Which of the following statements is correct? 
(A) At 10 mm Hg partial pressure, hemoglobin 
binds oxygen but myoglobin does not. 
(B) At 20 mm Hg partial pressure, myoglobin 
and hemoglobin bind oxygen in equal 
amounts. 
(C) At 40 mm Hg partial pressure, myoglobin has 
a greater affinity for oxygen than 
hemoglobin has. 
(D) At 80 mm Hg partial pressure, myoglobin 
binds twice as much oxygen as hemoglobin 
binds. 
 
52. Strenuous exercise lowers the blood pH, causing 
the curves for both hemoglobin and myoglobin to 
shift to the right. This shift results in
