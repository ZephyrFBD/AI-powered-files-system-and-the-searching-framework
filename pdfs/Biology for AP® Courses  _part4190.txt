sink to the bottom of the ocean when they die in the open water; when this occurs, the energy found in that living organism
is sequestered for some time unless ocean upwelling occurs. Ocean upwelling is the rising of deep ocean waters that
occurs when prevailing winds blow along surface waters near a coastline (Figure 35.9). As the wind pushes ocean waters
offshore, water from the bottom of the ocean moves up to replace this water. As a result, the nutrients once contained in
dead organisms become available for reuse by other living organisms.
Figure 35.9 Ocean upwelling is an important process that recycles nutrients and energy in the ocean. As wind (green
arrows) pushes offshore, it causes water from the ocean bottom (red arrows) to move to the surface, bringing up
nutrients from the ocean depths.
In freshwater systems, the recycling of nutrients occurs in response to air temperature changes. The nutrients at the bottom
of lakes are recycled twice each year: in the spring and fal
