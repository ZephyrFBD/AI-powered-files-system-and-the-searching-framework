Measuring g. A geologist uses a simple pendulum that has
a length of 37.10 cm and a frequency of 0.8190 Hz at a particular location on the
Earth. What is the acceleration due to gravity at this location?
APPROACH We can use the length 
and frequency f of the pendulum in
Eq. 11–11b, which contains our unknown, g.
SOLUTION We solve Eq. 11–11b for g and obtain
g = (2pf)2l = (2p)2

The amplitude of any real oscillating spring or swinging pendulum slowly decreases
in time until the oscillations stop altogether. Figure 11–14
