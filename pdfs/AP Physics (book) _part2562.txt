The plane containing all focus points, such as F and 
in
Fig. 23–35, is called the focal plane of the lens.
Any lens (in air) that is thicker in the center than at the edges will make par-
allel rays converge to a point, and is called a converging lens (see Fig. 23–31a).
Lenses that are thinner in the center than at the edges (Fig. 23–31b) are called
diverging lenses because they make parallel light diverge, as shown in Fig. 23–36.
The focal point, F, of a diverging lens is defined as that point from which refracted
rays, originating from parallel incident rays, seem to emerge as shown in Fig.23–36.
And the distance from F to the center of the lens is called the focal length, f, just
as for a converging lens.
EXERCISE F Return to Chapter-Opening Question 2, page 644, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.
Optometrists and ophthalmologists, instead of using the focal length, use the
reciprocal of
