Classification of Solids (Section 12.1)
 12.11  Covalent bonding occurs in both molecular and covalent- 
network solids. Which of the following statements best 
 
explains why these two kinds of solids differ so greatly in 
their hardness and melting points?
(a) The molecules in molecular solids have stronger covalent 
bonding than covalent-network solids do.
(b) The molecules in molecular solids are held together by 
weak intermolecular interactions.
(c) The atoms in covalent-network solids are more polariz-
able than those in molecular solids.
(d) Molecular solids are denser than covalent-network 
solids.
 12.12  Silicon is the fundamental component of integrated cir-
cuits. Si has the same structure as diamond. (a) Is Si a molec-
ular, metallic, ionic, or covalent-network solid? (b) Silicon 
readily reacts to form silicon dioxide, SiO2, which is quite 
hard and is insoluble in water. Is SiO2 most likely a molecu-
lar, metallic, ionic, or cova
