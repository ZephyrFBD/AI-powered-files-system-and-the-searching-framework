nd time
are intimately connected. Just as when we squeeze a balloon we make one
dimension larger and another smaller, so when we examine objects and events
from different reference frames, a certain amount of space is exchanged for time,
or vice versa.

Although the idea of four dimensions may seem strange, it refers to the idea
that any object or event is specified by four quantities—three to describe where
in space, and one to describe when in time. The really unusual aspect of four-
dimensional space–time is that space and time can intermix: a little of one can be
exchanged for a little of the other when the reference frame is changed.
[In Galilean–Newtonian relativity, the time interval between two events,
and the distance between two events or points,
are invariant quantities no
matter what inertial reference frame they are viewed from. Neither of these
quantities is invariant according to Einstein’s relativity. But there is an invariant
quant
