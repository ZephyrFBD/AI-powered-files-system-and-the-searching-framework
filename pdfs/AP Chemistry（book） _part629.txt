MnO4
-1aq2 + 5 Fe2+1aq2 + 8 H+1aq2 ยก  
Mn2+1aq2 + 5 Fe3+1aq2 + 4 H2O1l2
(a) How many moles of MnO4
- were added to the solution?  
(b) How many moles of Fe2+ were in the sample? (c) How 
many grams of iron were in the sample? (d) If the sample 
had a mass of 0.8890 g, what is the percentage of iron in the 
sample?
(a)  
Potassium phosphate and silver nitrate are both ionic 
compounds. Potassium phosphate contains K+ and PO4
3- 
ions, so its chemical formula is K3PO4. Silver nitrate 
contains Ag+ and NO3
- ions, so its chemical formula is

GENERAL PROPERTIES OF AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS (INTRODUC-
TION AND SECTION 4.1) Solutions in which water is the dissolving 
medium are called aqueous solutions. The component of the solution 
that is present in the greatest quantity is the solvent. The other com-
ponents are solutes.
Any substance whose aqueous solution contains ions is called
