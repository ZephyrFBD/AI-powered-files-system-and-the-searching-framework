tific method. But there is no 
single scientific method. Many factors play a role in advancing scien-
tific knowledge. The one unvarying requirement is that our explana-
tions be consistent with observations and that they depend solely on 
natural phenomena.
When nature behaves in a certain way over and over again, un-
der all sorts of different conditions, we can summarize that behavior 
in a scientific law. For example, it has been repeatedly observed 
that in a chemical reaction there is no change in the total mass of the 
materials reacting as compared with the materials that are formed; 
we call this observation the law of conservation of mass. It is important 
to make a distinction between a theory and a scientific law. On the 
one hand, a scientific law is a statement of what always happens, to 
the best of our knowledge. A theory, on the other hand, is an expla-
nation for what happens. If we discover some law fails to hold true, 
 
then we must assume the theory underlying tha
