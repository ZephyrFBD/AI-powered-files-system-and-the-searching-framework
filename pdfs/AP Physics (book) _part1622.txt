this process, yet we never see it happen.
There are many other examples of processes that occur in nature but whose
reverse does not. Here are two more. (1) If you put a layer of salt in a jar and
cover it with a layer of similar-sized grains of pepper, when you shake it you get a
thorough mixture. But no matter how long you shake it, the mixture does not
separate into two layers again. (2) Coffee cups and glasses break spontaneously
if you drop them. But they do not go back together spontaneously (Fig. 15â€“10).
The first law of thermodynamics (conservation of energy) would not be violated
if any of these processes occurred in reverse. To explain this lack of reversibility,
scientists in the latter half of the nineteenth century formulated a new principle
known as the second law of thermodynamics.
The second law of thermodynamics is a statement about which processes
occur in nature and which do not. It can be stated in a variety of ways, all of
which are equivalent. One statement, due t
