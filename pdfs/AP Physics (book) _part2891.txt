26–1 Galilean–Newtonian Relativity
Einstein’s special theory of relativity deals with how we observe events, particu-
larly how objects and events are observed from different frames of reference.†
This subject had already been explored by Galileo and Newton.
The special theory of relativity deals with events that are observed and meas-
ured from so-called inertial reference frames (Section 4–2 and Appendix C),
which are reference frames in which Newton’s first law is valid: if an object
experiences no net force, the object either remains at rest or continues in motion
with constant speed in a straight line. It is usually easiest to analyze events when
they are observed and measured by observers at rest in
