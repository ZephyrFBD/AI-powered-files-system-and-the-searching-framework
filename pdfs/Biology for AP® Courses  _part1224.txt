attachment of the spindle fiber microtubules to the kinetochore proteins at
the centromeres. Kinetochore proteins are multiprotein complexes that bind the centromeres of a chromosome to the
microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Microtubules grow from centrosomes placed at opposite poles of the cell. The
microtubules move toward the middle of the cell and attach to one of the two fused homologous chromosomes. The
microtubules attach at each chromosomes' kinetochores. With each member of the homologous pair attached to opposite
poles of the cell, in the next phase, the microtubules can pull the homologous pair apart. A spindle fiber that has attached
to a kinetochore is called a kinetochore microtubule. At the end of prometaphase I, each tetrad is attached to microtubules
from both poles, with one homologous chromosome facing each pole. The homologous chromosomes are still held together
at chiasmata. In addition, the nuclear membrane has broken down entirely.
