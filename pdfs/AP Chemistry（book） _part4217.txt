band gap increases and the emit-
ted light shifts to shorter wavelength. Figure 12.49 Each carbon 
atom in C60 is bonded to three neighboring carbon atoms through 
covalent bonds. Thus, the bonding is more like graphite, where 
carbon atoms also bond to three neighbors, than diamond, where 
carbon atoms bond to four neighbors.

Figure 13.1 Gas molecules move in constant random 
motion. Figure 13.2 Opposite charges attract. The electron-
rich O atom of the H2O molecule, which is the negative end of 
the dipole, is attracted to the positive Na+ ion. Figure 13.4 For 
exothermic solution processes the magnitude of ∆Hmix will be larger 
than the magnitude of ∆Hsolute + ∆Hsolvent Figure 13.7 46 g.  
Figure 13.12 If the partial pressure of a gas over a solution is  
doubled, the concentration of gas in the solution would double.  
Figure 13.13 The highest. Figure 13.15 Looking at where the 
solubility curves for KCl and NaCl intersect the 80 °C line, we see 
that the solubility of K
