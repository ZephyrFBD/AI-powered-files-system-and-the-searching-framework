3.1.1 Weber-Fechner law
Weber-Fechner law tells us that the increase in a geometric ratio of the
stimulation will only result in the increase in a linear ratio of the visual response. The
formulation is
C


, where , , C respectively stand for the difference
threshold, the standard stimulus intensity and the Weber rate.
Fechner, a German psychologist, proposed the law of logarithm to revise the
Weber-Fechner law. The law of logarithm describes the quantity relationship between
material stimulants and mental impression, whose formulation is
lg
S
K
R

,
where R , S , K respectively stands for the stimulus intensity, the feeling intensity and
the constant. This law states that all the feeling of people including visual sense,
auditory sense, cutaneous sensation, gustation, smell, shock sense and so on are not
proportional to the corresponding physical quantity, but proportional to the common
logarithm of the corresponding physical quantity.
