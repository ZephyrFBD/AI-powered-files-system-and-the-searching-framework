in space could be
accurately described. And they provided a theoretical base for
Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.
The four fundamental forces in nature are (1) the gravi-
tational force, (2) the electromagnetic force, (3) the strong nuclear
force, and (4) the weak nuclear force. The first two fundamental
forces are responsible for nearly all “everyday” forces.

Summary
1. How many “accelerators” do you have in your car? There
are at least three controls in the car which can be used to
cause the car to accelerate. What are they? What accelera-
tions do they produce?
2. A car rounds a curve at a steady 
If it rounds the
same curve at a steady 
will its acceleration be any
different? Explain.
3. Will the acceleration of a car be the same when a car travels
around a sharp curve at a constant 
as when it
travels around a gentle curve at the same speed? Explain.
4. Describe all the forces acting on a child riding a horse on 
a merry-go-round. Which of these forces provide
