y is transformed into kinetic energy that allows a car to race on a racetrack. (credit “car”:

Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/simple_pendulum) and select “A simple pendulum” on the menu (under
“Harmonic Motion”) to see the shifting kinetic (K) and potential energy (U) of a pendulum in motion.
Explain how the potential and kinetic energy shown in the pendulum model (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
simple_pendulum) relates to a child swinging on a swing set.
a.
Kinetic energy increases when the child swings downward, potential energy increases when the child swings
upward.
b.
Kinetic energy decreases when the child swings downward, potential energy decreases when the child swings
upward.
c.
Kinetic energy increases when the child swings upward, potential energy increases when the child swings
downward.
d.
Kinetic energy increases when child swings downward, potential energy increases when the child swings
downward.
