ation energy is the energy required for a reaction to proceed, and it is lower if the reaction is
catalyzed. The horizontal axis of this diagram describes the sequence of events in time.
How does the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) differ between the catalyzed versus uncatalyzed reaction?
a.
ΔG is greater for the forward direction than for the reverse direction.
b.
ΔG is greater for the uncatalyzed than the catalyzed reaction.
c.
ΔG is greater for the catalyzed than the uncatalyzed reaction.
d.
ΔG is the same for the catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions.
Think About It
All plants use water, carbon dioxide, and energy from the sun to make sugars. Think about what would happen to plants
that do not have sunlight as an energy source or sufficient water. What would happen to organisms that depend on
those plants for their own survival? How does depletion or destruction of forests by human activity affect free energy
availability to organisms living in the rain forest? What measures can be
