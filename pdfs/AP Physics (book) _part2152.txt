ts? Must any existing connections be broken
to accomplish this?
42. (II) An electric circuit was accidentally constructed using 
a 
capacitor instead of the required 
value.
Without removing the 
capacitor, what can a techni-
cian add to correct this circuit?
43. (II) Consider three capacitors, of capacitance 3200 pF,
5800 pF, and 
What maximum and minimum
capacitance can you form from these? How do you make
the connection in each case?
44. (II) Determine the equivalent capacitance between 
points a and b for the combination of capacitors shown in
Fig. 19–64.
