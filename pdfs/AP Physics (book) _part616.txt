not vertical, we could not have used Eqs. 2–11 because a is not constant on the
curved track of Example 6–8. But energy conservation readily gives us the answer.

FIGURE 6–18 A roller-coaster car
moving without friction illustrates
the conservation of mechanical
energy.
Equation 6–13 can be applied to any object moving without friction under
the action of gravity. For example, Fig. 6–18 shows a roller-coaster car starting
from rest at the top of a hill and coasting without friction to the bottom and up
the hill on the other side. True, there is another force besides gravity acting 
on the car, the normal force exerted by the tracks. But the normal force
acts perpendicular to the direction of motion at each point and so does zero
work. We ignore rotational motion of the car’s wheels and treat the car as a 
particle undergoing simple translation. Initially, the car has only potential energy.
As it coasts down the hill, it loses potential energy and gains in kinetic energy,
but the sum o
