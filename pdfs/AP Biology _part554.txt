ge, well-
established populations. The other ecosystem is a desert, which
floods and dries out at unpredictable times. Due to the unfavorable
conditions, the sizes of resident populations fluctuates.
Which of the following choices accurately describes which of
the two ecosystems would be more likely to support r-strategists and
provides the correct reasoning for that answer?
The stable stream-fed environment would better support r-
strategists because r-strategists can always outcompete any
other population by having hundreds of offspring at once.
The stable stream-fed environment would better support r-
strategists because r-strategists are less vulnerable to floods or
drought than K-strategists are.
The changing desert environment would better support r-
strategists because the r-strategists can lay hundreds of eggs
after other animals have been killed off by floods or drought.
The changing desert environment would better support r-
strategists because the r-strategists can produce a
