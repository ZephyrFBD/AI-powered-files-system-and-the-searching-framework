anol is only 34%â€”that is, for 
each 1.00 J of energy expended to produce the corn, 1.34 J of energy is 
produced in the form of bioethanol. Second, the use of corn as a starting 
material for making bioethanol competes with its use as an important 
component of the food chain (the so-called food versus fuel debate).
Much current research focuses on the formation of bioethanol 
from cellulosic plants, plants that contain the complex carbohydrate 
cellulose. Cellulose is not readily metabolized and so does not com-
pete with the food supply. However, the chemistry for converting 
cellulose to ethanol is much more complex than that for convert-
ing corn. Cellulosic bioethanol could be produced from very fast- 
growing nonfood plants, such as prairie grasses and switchgrass, 
which readily renew themselves without the use of fertilizers.
The Brazilian bioethanol industry uses sugarcane as its feedstock 
(Figure 5.27). Sugarcane grows much faster than corn and without the
