es. They have longer focal
lengths than a normal lens: as we saw in Section 23–8 (Eq. 23–9), the height of the
image for a given object distance is proportional to the image distance, and the
image distance will be greater for a lens with longer focal length. For distant
objects, the image height is very nearly proportional to the focal length. Thus
a 200-mm telephoto lens for use with a 35-mm camera gives a 
magnification
over the normal 50-mm lens. A wide-angle lens has a shorter focal length than
normal: a wider field of view is included, and objects appear smaller. A zoom lens
is one whose focal length can be changed (by changing the distance between the thin
lenses that make up the compound lens) so that you seem to zoom up to, or away
from, the subject as you change the focal length.
Digital cameras may have an optical zoom meaning the lens can change focal
length and maintain resolution. But an “electronic” or digital zoom just enlarges
the dots (pixels) with loss of sharpness.
