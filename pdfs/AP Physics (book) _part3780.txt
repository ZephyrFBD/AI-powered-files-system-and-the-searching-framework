ed until the
outputs compare favorably with our observations and analyses of WMAP and
other experiments. And we now have a surprisingly precise idea about some
aspects of our universe: it is flat, it is about 14 billion years old, it contains only
5% “normal” baryonic matter (for atoms), and so on.
The questions raised by cosmology are difficult and profound, and may seem
removed from everyday “reality.” We can always say, “the Sun is shining, it’s
going to shine on for an unimaginably long time, all is well.” Nonetheless, the
questions of cosmology are deep ones that fascinate the human intellect. One
aspect that is especially intriguing is this: calculations on the formation and
evolution of the universe have been performed that deliberately varied the
values—just slightly—of certain fundamental physical constants. The result?
