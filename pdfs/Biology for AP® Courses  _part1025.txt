Figure 9.8 A receptor tyrosine kinase is an enzyme-linked receptor with a single transmembrane region, and
extracellular and intracellular domains. Binding of a signaling molecule to the extracellular domain causes the
receptor to dimerize. Tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain are then autophosphorylated, triggering a
downstream cellular response. The signal is terminated by a phosphatase that removes the phosphates from the
phosphotyrosine residues.
HER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase. In 20 percent of human breast cancer cases, HER2 is permanently activated,
resulting in unregulated cell division. Lapatinib, a drug used to treat breast cancer, inhibits HER2 receptor tyrosine
kinase autophosphorylation, the process by which the receptor adds phosphates onto itself. This reduces tumor growth
by 50 percent. Besides autophosphorylation, which of the following steps would be inhibited by Lapatinib?
