Protein folding is critical to its function. It was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the
folding process. Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers
known as chaperones (or chaperonins) that associate with the target protein during the folding process. They act by
preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure, and they disassociate from the protein
once the target protein is folded.

Vegans are people who do not consume any animal products in their diet. Why do vegans need to pay special attention
to the protein they eat?
a.
Plant proteins contain all of the essential as well as non-essential amino acids.
b.
It is more difficult to obtain all essential amino acids from si
