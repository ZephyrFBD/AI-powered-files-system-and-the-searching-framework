ig. 17–31 for an LCD screen. (How liquid crystals work 
in an LCD screen is described in Section 24–11.) Subpixels are so small that at 
normal viewing distances we don’t distinguish them and the separate red (R),
green (G), and blue (B) subpixels blend to produce almost any color, depending
on the relative brightnesses of the three subpixels. Liquid crystals act as filters
(R, G, and B) that filter the light from a white backlight, usually fluorescent
lamps or light-emitting diodes (LED, Section 29–9).† The picture you see on 
the screen depends on the level of brightness of each subpixel, as suggested in
Fig. 17–32 for a simple black and white picture.
High definition (HD) television screens have 1080 horizontal rows of pixels,
each row consisting of 1920 pixels across the screen. That is, there are 1920 vertical
columns, for a total of nearly 2 million pixels. Today, television in the U.S. is trans-
mitted digitally at a rate of 60 Hz—that is, 60 frames or pictures per second (50 Hz
