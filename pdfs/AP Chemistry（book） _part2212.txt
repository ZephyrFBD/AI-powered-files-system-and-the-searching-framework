rate law and the data from experiment 1, we have:
k = rate
3A42 =
4.0 * 10-5 M>s
10.100 M22
= 4.0 * 10-3 M-1 s-1
(c) Using the rate law from part (a) and the rate constant from 
part (b), we have:
Rate = k3A42
 = 14.0 * 10-3 M-1s -1210.050 M22
 = 1.0 * 10-5 M>s
Because [B] is not part of the rate law, it is irrelevant to the 
rate if there is at least some B present to react with A.

CHAPTER 14 Chemical Kinetics
Equations 14.12 and 14.13 can be used with any concentration units as long as the 
units are the same for both 3A4t and 3A40. When dealing with gases, we can use pressure 
as a concentration in Equations 14.12 and 14.13. This substitution follows from the fact 
that the ideal gas law (see Section 10.4) dictates that at constant temperature the pressure 
is directly proportional to the concentration (n/V).
For a first-order reaction, Equation 14.12 or 14.13 can be used in several ways. 
Given any three of the following quantities, we can solve for the fourth: k, t, 3A40, and
