solution even more concentrated.
 13.36  Indicate whether each statement is true or false:
(a) If you compare the solubility of a gas in water at two dif-
ferent temperatures, you find the gas is more soluble at 
the lower temperature.
(b) The solubility of most ionic solids in water decreases as 
the temperature of the solution increases.
(c) The solubility of most gases in water decreases as the 
temperature increases because water is breaking its hy-
drogen bonding to the gas molecules as the tempera-
ture is raised.
(d) Some ionic solids become less soluble in water as the 
temperature is raised.
 13.37  The Henry’s law constant for helium gas in water at 30 °C 
is 3.7 * 10-4 M>atm and the constant for N2 at 30 °C is 
6.0 * 10-4 M>atm. If the two gases are each present at 1.5 
atm pressure, calculate the solubility of each gas.
 13.38  The partial pressure of O2 in air at sea level is 0.21 atm. Us-
ing the data in Table 13.1, together with Henry’s law, calcu-
late the molar conc
