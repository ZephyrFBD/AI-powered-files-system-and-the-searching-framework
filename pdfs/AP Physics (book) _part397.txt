 box are gravity 
the normal
force exerted by the floor 
the horizontal applied force 
and the fric-
tion force 
as shown in Fig. 4–27.
SOLUTION The free-body diagram of the box is shown in Fig. 4–27. In the vertical
direction there is no motion, so Newton’s second law in the vertical direction 
gives
which tells us 
Hence the normal force is
(a) Because
in this first case, the box doesn’t move, and
(b) The force of static friction will oppose any applied force up to a maximum of
When the applied force is 
the box will not move. Newton’s second
law gives  
so  
(c) An applied force of 20 N is also not sufficient to move the box. Thus
to balance the applied force.
(d) The applied force of 38 N is still not quite large enough to move the box;
so the friction force has now increased to 38 N to keep the box at rest.
(e) A force of 40 N will start the box moving since it exceeds the maximum force
of static friction,
Instead of static friction, we now
have kinetic friction, and its magnitude
