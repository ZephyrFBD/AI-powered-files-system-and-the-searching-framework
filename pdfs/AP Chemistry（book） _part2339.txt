-1 at 21 °C. 
(a) Write out the balanced equation for the reaction cata-
lyzed by urease. (b) If the rate of the catalyzed reaction were 
the same at 100 °C as it is at 21 °C, what would be the dif-
ference in the activation energy between the catalyzed and 
uncatalyzed reactions? (c) In actuality, what would you ex-
pect for the rate of the catalyzed reaction at 100 °C as com-
pared to that at 21 °C? (d) On the basis of parts (c) and (d), 
what can you conclude about the difference in activation 
energies for the catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions?
 [14.87] The activation energy of an uncatalyzed reaction is 
95 kJ>mol. The addition of a catalyst lowers the activa-
tion energy to 55 kJ>mol. Assuming that the collision 
factor remains the same, by what factor will the catalyst 
increase the rate of the reaction at (a) 25 °C, (b) 125 °C?
 [14.88] Suppose that a certain biologically important reaction 
is quite slow at physiological temperature 137 °C2 in the 
absence of a catalyst. Ass
