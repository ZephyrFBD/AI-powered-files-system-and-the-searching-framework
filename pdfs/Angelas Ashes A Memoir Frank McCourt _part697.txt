 start till Monday. She 
 
 says my clothes are a disgrace and what did I wash them in. 
 
 Carbolic soap. 
 
 They smell like dead pigeons and you’re making a laughingstock of 
 
 the whole family. 
 
 She takes me to Roche’s Stores and buys me a shirt, a gansey, a 
 
 pair of short pants, two pairs of stockings and a pair of summer shoes 
 
 on sale. She gives me two shillings to have tea and a bun for my birthday. 
 
 She gets on the bus to go back up O’Connell Street too fat and 
 
 lazy to walk. Fat and lazy, no son of her own, and still she buys me the 
 
 clothes for my new job. 
 
 I turn toward Arthur’s Quay with the package of new clothes under 
 
  
  
 310 
 
 my arm and I have to stand at the edge of the River Shannon so that 
 
 the whole world won’t see the tears of a man the day he’s fourteen. 
 
 Monday morning I’m up early to wash my face and flatten my hair with 
 
 water and spit.The Abbot sees me in my new clothes. Jaysus, he says, is 
 
 it gettin’ married you are
