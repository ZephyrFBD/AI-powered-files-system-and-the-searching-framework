12 Meiosis and Genetic Diversity
Learning Objectives
In this chapter, you will learn:
➜
How Meiosis Works
➜
How Meiosis Generates Genetic Diversity
Overview
Meiosis allows parents to pass on genetic information to their offspring. Meiosis helps accomplish this task while
also maintaining a consistent number of chromosomes in the offspring and creating genetic diversity in the species.
This chapter reviews the process of meiosis and how meiosis accomplishes these tasks. This chapter also compares
the similarities and differences between meiosis and mitosis.
How Meiosis Works
Meiosis is the process of cell division that is used in gamete formation. Meiosis forms haploid (n) gametes from
diploid (2n) parent cells. This helps maintain the proper number of chromosomes in the offspring. When a haploid
(n) e
