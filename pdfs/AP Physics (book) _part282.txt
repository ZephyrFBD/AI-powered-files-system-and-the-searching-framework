In Example 3–6, we treated the football as if it were a particle, ignoring its
rotation. We also ignored air resistance. Because air resistance is significant on a
football, our results are only estimates (mainly overestimates).
A punt. Suppose the football in Example 3–6 was punted,
and left the punter’s foot at a height of 1.00 m above the ground. How far did
the football travel before hitting the ground? Set
APPROACH The only difference here from Example 3–6 is that the football hits
the ground below its starting point of
That is, the ball hits the ground at
