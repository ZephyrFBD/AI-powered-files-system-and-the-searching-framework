to antigens
as stably as IgGs, which are one of the possible types of antibodies secreted in large quantities upon re-exposure to the same
pathogen. Figure 33.23 summarizes the properties of immunoglobulins and illustrates their basic structures.
Figure 33.23 Immunoglobulins have different functions, but all are composed of light and heavy chains that form a
Y-shaped structure.
IgAs populate the saliva, tears, breast milk, and mucus secretions of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary
tracts. Collectively, these bodily fluids coat and protect the extensive mucosa (4000 square feet in humans). The total
number of IgA molecules in these bodily secretions is greater than the number of IgG molecules in the blood serum. A small
amount of IgA is also secreted into the serum in monomeric form. Conversely, some IgM is secreted into bodily fluids of
the mucosa. Similar to IgM, IgA molecules are secreted as polymeric structures linked with a J chain. However, IgAs are
secreted most
