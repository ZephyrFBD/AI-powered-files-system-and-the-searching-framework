coin is flipped 100
times, the number of heads obtained would approach the expected probability of ½. However, if the coin is flipped
only 5 times (analogous to a small population), one may obtain, by chance, all tails. Similarly, gene frequencies,
especially in small populations, may change by chance.
Two special kinds of genetic drift are commonly observed, as follows:
The founder effect occurs when allele frequencies in a group of migrating individuals are, by chance, not the same
as that of their population of origin. For example, one of the founding members of the small group of Germans that
began the Amish community in Pennsylvania possessed an allele for polydactylism (more than five fingers or toes
on a limb). After 200 years of reproductive
isolation, the number of cases of this trait among the 8,000 Amish exceeded the number of cases occurring in the
remaining world’s population.
A bottleneck occurs when the population undergoes a dramatic decrease in size. Regardless of the
