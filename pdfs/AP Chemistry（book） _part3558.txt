The Other Group 5A Elements:  
P, As, Sb, and Bi
Of the other group 5A elements—phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth—phos-
phorus has a central role in several aspects of biochemistry and environmental chemistry.
The group 5A elements have the outer-shell electron configuration ns2np3, with n 
ranging from 2 to 6. A noble-gas configuration is achieved by adding three electrons to 
form the -3 oxidation state. Ionic compounds containing X3 -  ions are not common, 
however. More commonly, the group 5A element acquires an octet of electrons via cova-
lent bonding and oxidation numbers ranging from -3 to +5.
Because of its lower electronegativity, phosphorus is found more frequently in pos-
itive oxidation states than is nitrogen. Furthermore, compounds in which phosphorus 
has the +5 oxidation state are not as strongly oxidizing as the corresponding compounds 
of nitrogen. Compo
