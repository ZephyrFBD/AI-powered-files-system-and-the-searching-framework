with the opportunity to
review concepts weâ€™ve explored previously, including structure and function, macromolecules, energy production, transport
of substances across membranes, and enzyme activity. All living organisms require a source of energy and molecules
needed to build cells, tissues, and organs. During digestion, food is broken down into smaller molecules for absorption
and distribution to all cells of the body. Nutrients are required to carry out cellular processes and maintain homeostasis,
and digestion and absorption require the participation of several organs. Different animals have evolved different types of
digestive systems specialized to meet their dietary needs. You do not need to memorize details about the different types of
animal digestive systems, but you might find it interesting to explore the evolution of the system through a few groups of
animals, from intracellular digestion in simple invertebrates to a digestive tract and accessory organs in complex vertebrat
