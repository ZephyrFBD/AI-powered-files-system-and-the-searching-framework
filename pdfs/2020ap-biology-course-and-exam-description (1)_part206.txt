EVO-1.N.1
Molecular, morphological, and genetic 
evidence from extant and extinct organisms 
adds to our understanding of evolution—
a.	Fossils can be dated by a variety of methods. 
These include:
  i.	 The age of the rocks where a fossil 
is found
 ii.	 The rate of decay of isotopes including 
carbon-14
iii.	 Geographical data
b.	Morphological homologies, including 
vestigial structures, represent features 
shared by common ancestry.
EVO-1.N.2
A comparison of DNA nucleotide sequences 
and/or protein amino acid sequences provides 
evidence for evolution and common ancestry.
EVO-1.N
Explain how morphological, 
biochemical, and geological 
data provide evidence that 
organisms hav
