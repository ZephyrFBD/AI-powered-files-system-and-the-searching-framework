e do exist. Identify an example of a
positive feedback loop.
a.
Insulin facilitates decrease of blood sugar levels.
b.
Oxytocin release stimulates milk release.
c.
Increased blood calcium levels halt PTH
production.
d.
Increased amounts of T3 and T4 inhibit further
production.
67. Although positive feedback loops are rare in the
endocrine system, they are present in childbirth. Explain
how childbirth is controlled by a positive feedback loop.
a.
When a child pushes on the cervix, a signal is
sent to stimulate oxytocin release, which
stimulates more contractions. This promotes
more oxytocin release that allows the child to be
pushed through the birth canal.
b.
When a child pushes on the cervix, a signal is
sent to stimulate oxytocin release, which
stimulates contractions. This promotes release of
progesterone that allows the child to be pushed
through the birth canal.
c.
When a child pushes on the cervix, a signal is
sent to stimulate prolactin release, which
stimulates more contraction
