here is a very large number of microstates for each 
state—that is, W is generally an extremely large number.
The connection between the number of microstates of a 
system, W, and the entropy of the system, S, is expressed in 
a beautifully simple equation developed by Boltzmann and 
engraved on his tombstone (Figure 19.7):
S = k ln W 
[19.5]
In this equation, k is the Boltzmann constant, 1.38 * 10-23 J>K. 
 
We see from the equation that:
Entropy is a measure of how many microstates are  
associated with a particular macroscopic state.
▲ Figure 19.7 Ludwig Boltzmann’s gravestone. Boltzmann’s gravestone in 
Vienna is inscribed with his famous relationship between the entropy of 
a state, S, and the number of available microstates, W. (In Boltzmann’s 
time, “log” was used to represent the natural logarithm.)
Give It Some Thought
What is the entropy of a system that has only a single microstate?
From Equation 19.5, we see that the entropy change accompanying any process is
 
∆S = k ln Wf
