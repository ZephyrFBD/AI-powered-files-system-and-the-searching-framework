A similar effect is responsible for the
lanthanides and actinides, which are shown at the bottom of the Periodic Table
for convenience. All have very similar chemical properties, which are determined
by their two outer 6s or 7s electrons, whereas the different numbers of electrons
in the unfilled inner shells have little effect.
28–9 X-Ray Spectra and 
Atomic Number
The line spectra of atoms in the visible, UV, and IR regions of the EM spectrum
are mainly due to transitions between states of the outer electrons. Much of the
positive charge of the nucleus is shielded from these electrons by the negative
charge on the inner electrons. But the innermost electrons in the 
shell “see”
the full charge of the nucleus. Since the energy of a level is proportional to 
(see Eq. 27–15), for an atom with
