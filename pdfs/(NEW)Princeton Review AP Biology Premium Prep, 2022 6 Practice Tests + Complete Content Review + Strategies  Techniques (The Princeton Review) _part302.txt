parent that are TG and tg, respectively. If the Tg and tG alleles were linked in that parent, how could they produce a
few TG and tg gametes? The answer is through recombination! Even though those alleles were not found on the
same chromosome, recombination must have occurred during meiosis to swap them. This allowed gametes to be
formed with TG and tg, and offspring to occur that were Tall/Green and short/yellow. The offspring formed from
recombination events are called recombinants. The percentage of recombination (recombination frequency) can
be determined by adding up the recombinants and dividing by the total number of offspring.
9/91 = 9.9%
This percentage can also be used as a measure of how far apart the genes are. The distance on a chromosome is
measured in map units, or centimorgans.
The frequency of crossing-over between any two linked alleles is proportional to the distance between them. That is,
the farther apart two linked alleles are on a chromosome, the more often the c
