ular to the radius and
perpendicular to the force of gravity. Hence the angle 
between the force 
and the instantaneous displacement of the Moon is 90°, and the work done by
gravity is therefore zero
This is why the Moon, as well as artificial
satellites, can stay in orbit without expenditure of fuel: no work needs to be done
against the force of gravity.
6–2 Work Done by a Varying Force
If the force acting on an object is constant, the work done by that force can be
calculated using Eq. 6–1. But in many cases, the force varies in magnitude or
direction during a process. For example, as a rocket moves away from Earth, work
is done to overcome the force of gravity, which varies as the inverse square of 
the distance from the Earth’s center. Other examples are the force exerted by 
a spring, which increases with the amount of stretch, or the work done by a vary-
ing force that pulls a box or cart up an uneven hill.
The work done by a varying force can be determined graphically. To do so,
