p along the way toward the 
development of a more comprehensive model. What is most significant about Bohr’s model 
is that it introduces two important ideas that are also incorporated into our current model:
 1. Electrons exist only in certain discrete energy levels, which are described by  
 
quantum numbers.
 2. Energy is involved in the transition of an electron from one level to another.
We will now start to develop the successor to the Bohr model, which requires that we 
take a closer look at the behavior of matter.
6.4 ∣ The Wave Behavior of Matter
In the years following the development of Bohr’s model for the hydrogen atom, the 
dual nature of radiant energy became a familiar concept. Depending on the experi-
mental circumstances, radiation appears to have either a wave-like or a particle-like 
(photon) character. Louis de Broglie (1892–1987), who was working on his Ph.D. the-
sis in physics at the Sorbonne in Paris, boldly extended this idea: If radiant energy 
could, under ap
