-over?
(B) Are tetrads formed in the center of the cell as a result of plant cytokinesis?
(C) When homologous chromosomes pair up through the process of synapsis, does a cell plate form?
(D) Does cytokinesis still occur in plant cells when Golgi vesicles are inhibited from traveling to the center of
the cell?
This might seem like a difficult problem. But let’s think about the associations we just discussed. The question asks
us about mitosis. However, (A), (B), and (C) all mention events that we’ve associated with meiosis. Therefore, they
are out. Without even racking your brain, you’ve managed to find the correct answer: (D). Not bad!
Once again, don’t worry about the science for now. We’ll review it later. What is important to recognize is that by
combining the associations we’ll offer throughout this book and your aggressive POE techniques, you’ll be able to
rack up points on problems that might have seemed difficult at first.
