eleasing the ascospores. Each ascospore can develop into a new
haploid fungus; see Figure 19.19.

By observing the arrangements of ascospores from a cross between
wild-type (black) and a mutant tan type Sordaria fimicola fungus, you can
estimate the percentage of crossing-over that will occur between the
centromere and the gene that controls the tan spore color. Count 50–100
hybrid asci, and calculate the distance in map units between the gene for
spore color and the centromere using this formula,
Divide the number of crossover asci (2 : 2 : 2 : 2 or 2 : 4 : 2) by the total

Introduction
Many years ago if a person was diabetic and needed insulin, the insulin
was harvested from other mammals, such as pigs and cows, because their
insulin was similar to human insulin. Today, human insulin is
“manufactured” by bacteri
