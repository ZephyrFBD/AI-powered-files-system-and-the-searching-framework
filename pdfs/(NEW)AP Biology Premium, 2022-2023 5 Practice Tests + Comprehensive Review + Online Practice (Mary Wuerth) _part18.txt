erimental scenario. You may be asked to identify the parts of the experiment
(such as any controls, the independent variable, and the dependent variable), predict results, and justify your
predictions. You may also be asked to describe the biological processes covered in the experiment.
Question 4 is typically a conceptual analysis question. In this question, you may be asked to describe and
explain a biological process. Given a disruption in the process, you must predict how that disruption will affect the
process and justify your prediction with evidence.
Question 5 may ask you to analyze a model or visual representation of a biological concept. You may be
presented with a diagram and asked to describe the characteristics of the process represented in this model. Then,
you may be asked to explain the relationships between the different parts of the model and relate or apply the model
to a larger biological concept.
Question 6 may ask you to analyze data. You may see data in a graph o
