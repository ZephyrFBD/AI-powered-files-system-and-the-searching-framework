= 6.01 kJ
∆H = 0.91 kJ + 6.01 kJ + 7.52 kJ + 40.7 kJ + 0.83 kJ = 56.0 kJ
SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 11.3 
Calculating ∆H for Temperature and Phase Changes
For line BC in Figure 11.22, in which we convert ice to water at 
0 °C, we can use the molar enthalpy of fusion directly:
The enthalpy changes for lines CD, DE, and EF can be calculated 
in similar fashion:
The total enthalpy change is the sum of the changes of the  
individual steps:
Check The components of the total enthalpy change are reason-
able relative to the horizontal lengths (heat added) of the lines 
in Figure 11.22. Notice that the largest component is the heat of 
vaporization.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
What information about water is needed to calculate the 
enthalpy change for converting 1 mol H2O1g2 at 100 °C to 
H2O1l2 at 80 °C?
(a) heat of fusion (b) heat of vaporization (c) heat of vapor-
ization and specific heat of H2O1g2 (d) heat of vaporization 
and specific heat of H2O1l2 (e) heat of fusion and specific 
heat of H2
