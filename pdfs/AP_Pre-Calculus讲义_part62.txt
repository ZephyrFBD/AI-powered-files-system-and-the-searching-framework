Use the laws of logarithms to expand each expression. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Laws of Logarithms also allow us to reverse the process of expanding that was done 
in Example 2. 
That is, we can write sums and differences of logarithms as a single logarithm. 
This process, called combining logarithmic expressions, is illustrated in the next example. 
 
Example 3 
Use the Laws of Logarithms to combine each expression into a single logarithm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.7.3 Change of Base Formula 
For some purposes we find it useful to change from logarithms in one base to logarithms in 
another base. 
Suppose we are given loga x and want to find logb x. 
Let y = logb x 
We write this in exponential form and take the logarithm, with base a, of each side.

In particular, if we put x = a, then loga a = 1, and this formula becomes
