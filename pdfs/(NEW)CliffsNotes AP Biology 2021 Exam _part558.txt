ses into the fish. In response, freshwater fish rarely drink, constantly urinate, and absorb salts (that
they lose in their urine) through their gills by active transport.
Various excretory mechanisms have evolved in animals for the purpose of osmoregulation and for the removal of
toxic substances. Toxic substances include by-products of cellular metabolism, such as the nitrogen products of
protein breakdown. Examples of important excretory mechanisms follow:
1. Contractile vacuoles are found in the cytoplasm of various protists, such as paramecia and amoebas. These
vacuoles accumulate water, merge with the plasma membrane, and release the water to the environment.
2. Flame cells are found in various flatworms, such as planaria. The flame cells are distributed along a branched
tube system that permeates the flatworm. Body fluids are filtered across the flame cells, whose internal cilia move
the fluids through the tube system. Wastes (water and salts) are excreted from the tube system t
