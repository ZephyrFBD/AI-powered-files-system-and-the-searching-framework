recessive alleles are in the
population and divide by the total number of alleles in the population. There are a total of 1,000 individuals
(520 + 400 + 80 = 1,000), so there are 2,000 alleles in total. Each of the 400 heterozygous individuals
contributes one nontaster allele (400 nontaster alleles), and each of the 80 nontaster individuals contributes two
nontaster alleles (160 nontaster alleles) for a total of 560 nontaster alleles: 
. Choices (B), (C), and (D)
do not list the correct frequency.
32. (B) Carriers of the nontasting allele are heterozygous. There are 400 heterozygous individuals in a total
population of 1,000 individuals, so the frequency of carriers is 
. Choices (A), (C), and (D) do not list
the correct frequency.
33. (B) Prokaryotic cells do not contain mitochondria or chloroplasts, and eukaryotic cells have linear
chromosomes, so cell B has characteristics of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Choice (A) is incorrect
because circular chromosomes and the lack of
