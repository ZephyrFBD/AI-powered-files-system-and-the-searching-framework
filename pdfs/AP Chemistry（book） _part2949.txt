Desalination may be accomplished by distillation or by reverse 
osmosis.
The water available from freshwater sources may require treat-

used in municipal water treatment include coarse filtration, sedi-
mentation, sand filtration, aeration, and sterilization.
GREEN CHEMISTRY (SECTION 18.5) The green chemistry initia-
tive promotes the design and application of chemical products and 
processes that are compatible with human health and that preserve 
the environment. The areas in which the principles of green chem-
istry can operate to improve environmental quality include choices 
of solvents and reagents for chemical rea
