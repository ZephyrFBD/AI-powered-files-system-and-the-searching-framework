 pair of slits, one below each of these, will also cancel. That is, the
light from slit 1 cancels with light from slit 501; light from slit 2 cancels with light
from slit 502, and so on. Thus even for a tiny angle† corresponding to an extra path
length of 
there is much destructive interference, and so the maxima of a 
diffraction grating are very narrow. The more slits there are in a grating, the sharper
will be the peaks (see Fig. 24–25). Because a grating produces much sharper
maxima than two slits alone, and also much brighter maxima because there are
many more slits, a grating is a far more precise device for measuring wavelengths.
Suppose the light striking a diffraction grating is not monochromatic, but con-
sists of two or more distinct wavelengths. Then for all orders other than
each wavelength will produce a maximum at a different angle (Eq. 24–4), forming
a line on the screen as shown in Fig. 24–26a.
