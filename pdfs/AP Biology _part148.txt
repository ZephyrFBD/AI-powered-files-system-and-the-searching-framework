furthers the discussion about Big Idea IST—the transmission of
information from one generation to the next. In eukaryotic
organisms, heritable information is packaged into chromosomes
that are passed from parent to daughter cells.
The cell cycle is a highly regulated and complex process with
checkpoints that stop and start cell division. Some mature cells,
like neurons, no longer divide and are arrested in G0. Skin and cells
that line the digestive tract divide often.

The cell cycle is directed by internal and external controls or
checkpoints. Cancer is a disease in which normal controls of the
cell cycle, like density-dependent inhibition, go awry. As a result,
cancer cells never stop dividing.
Three checkpoints exist in the cell cycle: G1, G2, and M. G1 is the
most important restriction point in mammals. The cell cycle is
initiated by growth factors and controlled by two kinds of
molecules: cyclins and kina
