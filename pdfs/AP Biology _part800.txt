 (B) is not correct because one primary oogonium
cell produces one active egg cell, not four active egg cells. Choice
(D) is not correct because sperm production involves one mitotic
cell division followed by two meiotic cell divisions.
(A) Clearly, the type of genes present is not the issue, since tissue
from one individual (with one set of genes) was grafted onto another
individual (with another set of genes). Therefore, choices (B), (C),
and (D) are incorrect. It must be that a substance from the cytoplasm
in the host embryo directed the grafted cells by altering the
expression of some genes. This area from which Spemann and
Mangold took the tissue (adjacent to the dorsal lip) was named the
“organizer” because it directs neighboring cells to develop. It is a
region of the cytoplasm (a “cytoplasmic determinant”) that
organized the neighboring cells.
