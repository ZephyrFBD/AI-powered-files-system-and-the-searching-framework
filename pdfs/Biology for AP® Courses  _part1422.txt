ental type. In (c), two genes are far apart on the chromosome such that
crossing over occurs during every meiotic event. The recombination frequency will be the same as if the genes
were on separate chromosomes. (d) The actual recombination frequency of fruit fly wing length and body color
that Thomas Morgan observed in 1912 was 17 percent. A crossover frequency between 0 percent and 50 percent
indicates that the genes are on the same chromosome and crossover occurs some of the time.
In a test cross for two characteristics such as the one shown here, can the predicted frequency of recombinant offspring
be 60% ? Why or why not?
a.
Yes, the predicted offspring frequencies range from 0% to 100%
b.
No, the predicted offspring frequencies cannot be higher than 30% .
c.
Yes, the predicted offspring frequencies range from 0% to 60% .
d.
No, the predicted offspring frequencies range from 0% to 50% .
