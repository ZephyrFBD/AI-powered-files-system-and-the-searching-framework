EXAMPLE 19;5
Bulb brightness in a circuit. The circuit
in Fig. 19–8 has three identical lightbulbs, each of resistance R. (a) When switch S
is closed, how will the brightness of bulbs A and B compare with that of bulb C?
(b) What happens when switch S is opened? Use a minimum of mathematics.
RESPONSE (a) With switch S closed, the current that passes through bulb C must
split into two equal parts when it reaches the junction leading to bulbs A and B
because the resistance of bulb A equals that of B. Thus, A and B each receive half
of C’s current; A and B will be equally bright, but less bright than C
(b) When the switch S is open, no current can flow through bulb A, so it will be
dark. Now, the same current passes through bulbs B and C, so B and C will 
be equally bright. The equivalent resistance of this circuit 
is greater
than that of the circuit with t
