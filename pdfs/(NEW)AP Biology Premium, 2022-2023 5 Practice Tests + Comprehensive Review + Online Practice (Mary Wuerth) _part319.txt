 dominant trait (but an unknown genotype) is crossed with an
organism with the recessive phenotype. If the tall plant is heterozygous and is crossed with a short plant (the
recessive phenotype), half of the offspring would be tall and half would be short, as shown in this Punnett
square.

Overview
The inheritance of many traits do not follow the laws of Mendelian genetics. When the observed ratios of
phenotypes in the offspring do not follow the ratios predicted by the Punnett squares and Mendelian laws, it may be
the result of linked genes, multiple genes coding for the phenotype, nonnuclear inheritance, or even the effects of the
environment on the phenotype, all of which will be discussed in this chapter.
Linked Genes
As discussed in Chapter 12, genes that are close together on the same chromosome are s
