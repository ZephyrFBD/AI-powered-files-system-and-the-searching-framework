eeping them properly balanced to maintain homeostasis.
Plants absorb and transport water, nutrients, and ions from the surrounding soil 
via osmosis, diffusion, and active transport. Once water and dissolved nutrients have 
entered the root xylem, they are transported upward to the stems and leaves as part of 
the process of transpiration, with a subsequent loss of water due to evaporation from the 
leaf surface. Too much water loss can be detrimental to plants; they can wilt and die.
The transport of water upward from roots to shoots in the xylem is governed by 
differences in water (or osmotic) potential, with water molecules moving from an area 
of high water potential (higher free energy, more water) to an area of low water potential 
(lower free energy, less water). (You may have studied the concept of water potential in 
more detail when exploring the processes of osmosis and diffusion in Investigation 4 
in this manual.) The movement of water through a plant is facilitated by os
