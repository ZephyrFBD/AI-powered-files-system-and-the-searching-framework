iation). Both pathways isolate a population reproductively in some form.
Mechanisms of reproductive isolation act as barriers between closely related species, enabling them to diverge and exist as
genetically independent species. Prezygotic barriers block reproduction prior to formation of a zygote, whereas
postzygotic barriers block reproduction after fertilization occurs. For a new species to develop, something must cause a
breach in the reproductive barriers. Sympatric speciation can occur through errors in meiosis that form gametes with extra
chromosomes (polyploidy). Autopolyploidy occurs within a single species, whereas allopolyploidy occurs between closely
related species.
18.3 Reconnection and Rates of Speciation
Speciation is not a precise division: overlap between closely related species can occur in areas called hybrid zones.
Organisms reproduce with other similar organisms. The fitness of these hybrid offspring can affect the evolutionary path
of the two species. Scientists
