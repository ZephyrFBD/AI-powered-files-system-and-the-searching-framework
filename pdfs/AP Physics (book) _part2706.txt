ransmits only the vertical component of
a wave (electric field) incident upon it.
FIGURE 24–42 Unpolarized light
has equal intensity vertical and
horizontal components. After passing
through a polarizer, one of these
components is eliminated. The
intensity of the light is reduced to half.
You can try this with Polaroid sunglasses (Fig. 24–44). Note that Polaroid sun-
glasses eliminate 50% of unpolarized light because of their polarizing property;
they absorb even more because they are colored. Plane-polarized light in any
direction is also stopped by crossed Polaroids.
Two Polaroids at 60°. Unpolarized light passes through
two Polaroids; the axis of the first is vertical and that of the second is at 60° to
the vertical. Describe the orientation and intensity of the transmitted light.
APPROACH Half of the unpolarized light is absorbed by the first Polaroid, and the
remaining light emerges plane-polarized vertically. When that light passes through
the second Polaroid, the intensity is fu
