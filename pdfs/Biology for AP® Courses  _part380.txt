interior.
d.
Polar and charged amino acids will be found on
the surface of a membrane protein whereas non-
polar in the interior. The membrane protein will
be polar and hydrophobic.
69. You have been identifying the sequence of a segment
of a protein. The sequence to date is: leucine-methionine-
tyrosine-alanine-glutamine-lysine-glutamate. You insert
arginine between the leucine and methionine. What effect
would this have on the segment?
a.
Arginine is a negatively charged amino acid and
could attach to the glutamate at the end of the
segment
b.
Inserting arginine places a positively charged
amino acid in a portion that is non-polar,
creating the possibility of a hydrogen bond in
this area.
c.
There would be no effect other than an
additional amino acid.
d.
The arginine could attach to the lysine and bend
the protein chain at this point.
70. What would happen if even one amino acid is
substituted for another in a polypeptide? What would be
an example?
a.
The change will definitely not
