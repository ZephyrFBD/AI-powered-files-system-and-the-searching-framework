y eyes.The minute I 
 
 get home she washes them and makes me rest them for half an hour. 
 
 Mr.Hannon says he’ll wait near Leamy’s School for me on Thursdays 
 
 after his deliveries on Barrington Street.Now the boys will see me. 
 
 Now they’ll know I’m a workingman and more than a scabby-eyed 
 
 blubber gob dancing Jap. Mr.Hannon says, Up you get, and I climb up 
 
 on the float like any workingman. I look at the boys gawking at me. 
 
 Gawking. I tell Mr. Hannon if he wants to smoke his pipe in comfort 
 
 I’ll take the reins and when he hands them over I’m sure I hear the boys 
 
 gasping. I tell the horse, G’up ower that, like Mr.Hannon.We trot away 
 
 and I know dozens of Leamy’s boys are committing the deadly sin of 
 
 envy. I tell the horse again, G’up ower that, to make sure everyone 
 
 heard, to make sure they know I’m driving that float and no one else, 
 
  
  
 to make sure they’ll never forget it was me they saw on that float with

 the reins and the whip.
