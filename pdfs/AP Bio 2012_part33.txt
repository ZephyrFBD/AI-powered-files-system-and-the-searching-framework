photosynthesis. 
(C) Tubulin genes are evolutionarily derived 
from the gene that codes for the FtsZ 
protein. 
(D) The sequences of the genes encoding the FtsZ 
and tubulin proteins are identical. 
 
21. In most freshwater fish, nitrogenous waste is 
primarily excreted as ammonia, which is highly 
soluble in water and is toxic at low 
concentrations. In terrestrial mammals, ammonia 
is converted to urea before it is excreted. Urea is 
also highly soluble in water but is less toxic than 
ammonia at low concentrations. Which of the 
following best explains why freshwater fish do 
not convert ammonia to urea for excretion? 
(A) The metabolic pathways of fish do not  
normally involve nitrogen consumption. 
(B) The dilution of ammonia by direct excretion 
into freshwater conserves energy. 
(C) Ammonia is concentrated in tissues, where it 
is stored prior to excretion. 
(D) The nitrogen in ammonia is recycled for use 
in protein and nucleotide synthesis.
