Which is the correct net ionic equation for the reaction of 
aqueous ammonia with nitric acid?
(a) NH4
+1aq2 + H+1aq2 ¡ NH5
2+1aq2
(b) NH31aq2 + NO3
- 1aq2 ¡ NH2
-1aq2 + HNO31aq2
(c) NH2
- 1aq2 + H+1aq2 ¡ NH31aq2
(d) NH31aq2 + H+1aq2 ¡ NH4
+1aq2
(e) NH4
+1aq2 + NO3
-1aq2 ¡ NH4NO31aq2
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
For the reaction of phosphorous acid 1H3PO32 and potassium 
hydroxide (KOH), write (a) the balanced molecular equation 
and (b) the net ionic equation. Note that phosphorous acid is 
a diprotic acid.
2 CH3COOH1aq2 + Ba1OH221aq2
¡ 2 H2O1l2 + Ba1CH3COO221aq2
2 CH3COOH1aq2 + Ba2+1aq2 + 2OH-1aq2
¡ 2 H2O1l2 + Ba2+1aq2 + 2 CH3COO-1aq2
(c)  
Eliminating the spectator ion, Ba2+, and simplifying coefficients 
give the net ionic equation:
CH3COOH1aq2 + OH-1aq2 ¡ H2O1l2 + CH3COO-1aq2
