ial hydrides. 
 (Section 22.2) This process generally makes the metal harder. Tungsten 
carbide (WC), for example, is very hard and very heat-resistant and, thus, used to make 
cutting tools.
Covalent carbides are formed by boron and silicon. Silicon carbide (SiC), known as 
Carborundum®, is used as an abrasive and in cutting tools. Almost as hard as diamond, 
SiC has a diamond-like structure with alternating Si and C atoms.

The Other Group 4A Elements: 
Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb
The trend from nonmetallic to metallic character as we go down a family is strikingly evi-
dent in group 4A. Carbon is a nonmetal; silicon and germanium are metalloids; tin and 
lead are metals. In this section, we consider a few general characteristics of group 4A and 
then look more thoroughly at silicon.
General Characteristics of the Group 4A Elements
The group 4A elements possess the outer-shell electron configuration ns2np2. The elec-
tronegativities of the elements are generally low (Table 22.8); car
