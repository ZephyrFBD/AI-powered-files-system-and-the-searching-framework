potentials, etc.) rather than answering the question. 
While students were able to provide adequate descriptions, many students failed to provide adequate 
reasoning connecting the reflex with the ability of the organism to avoid a threat.

the exam?  
Teachers should emphasize that the central nervous system includes both the brain and spinal cord and 
have students investigate both the reflex and typical stimulus response pathways. Teachers should 
provide students with opportunities to describe models and representations and to carefully look at the 
information the model is providing. Teachers should also continue to emphasize the importance of 
carefully reading the question, as students used a great deal of time constructing unnecessarily long 
responses to this question. Teache
