ns and silicon is 
found in its most common oxidation state, +4. The orthosilicate ion, SiO4
4 -, is found in 
very few silicate minerals, but we can view it as the “building block” for many mineral 
structures. As Figure 22.32 shows, adjacent tetrahedra can be linked by a common oxygen 
atom. Two tetrahedra joined in this way, called the disilicate ion, contain two Si atoms 
and seven O atoms. Silicon and oxygen are in the +4 and -2 oxidation states, respec-
tively, in all silicates, so the overall charge of any silicate ion must be consistent with 
these oxidation states. For example, the charge on Si2O7 is 1221+42 + 1721-22 = -6; it 
is the Si2O7
6 - ion.
In most silicate minerals, silicate tetrahedra are linked together to form chains, 
sheets, or three-dimensional structures. We can connect two vertices of each tetra-
hedron to two other tetrahedra, for example, leading to an infinite chain with an 
 
g O ¬Si¬O ¬Si g  backbone as shown in Figure 22.32(b). Notice that each silicon
