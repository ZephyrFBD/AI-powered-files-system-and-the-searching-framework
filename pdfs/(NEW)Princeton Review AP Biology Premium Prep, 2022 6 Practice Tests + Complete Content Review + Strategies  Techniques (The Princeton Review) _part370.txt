us amyloliquefaciens that recognizes short palindromic
sequences in DNA. When the enzyme recognizes these sequences, it cleaves the DNA. What purpose would
restriction enzymes have in a bacterium like Bacillus?
(A) They are enzymes that no longer have a purpose because evolution has produced better enzymes.
(B) They destroy extra DNA that results from errors in binary fission.
(C) They protect Bacillus from invading DNA due to viruses.
(D) They prevent, or restrict, DNA replication when the cell isnâ€™t ready to copy its DNA.
9. Viruses and bacteria have which of the following in common?
(A) Ribosomes
(B) Nucleic acids
(C) Flagella
(D) Metabolism
10. Griffith was a researcher who coined the term transformation when he noticed that incubating nonpathogenic
bacteria with heat-killed pathogenic bacteria produced bacteria that ultimately became pathogenic, or deadly,
in mice. What caused the transformation in his experiment?
(A) DNA from the nonpathogenic bacteria revitalized the heat-killed
