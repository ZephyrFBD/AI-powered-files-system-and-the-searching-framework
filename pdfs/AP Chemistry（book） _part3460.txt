21.8  The diagram shown here illustrates a fission process. 
 
(a) What is the unidentified product of the fission? 
 
(b) Use Figure 21.2 to predict whether the nuclear prod-
ucts of this fission reaction are stable. [Section 21.7]

emission? (c) Some of the isotopes shown are used in posi-
tron emission tomography. Which ones would you expect 
to be most useful for this application? (d) Which isotope 
would decay to 12.5% of its original concentration after 1 
hour? [Sections 21.2, 21.4, and 21.5]
 21.34  It has been suggested that strontium-90 (generated by 
nuclear testing) deposited in the hot desert will undergo 
radioactive decay more rapidly because it will be exposed to 
much higher average temperatures. (a) Is this a reasonable 
suggestion? (b) Does the process of radioactive decay have 
an activation energy, like the
