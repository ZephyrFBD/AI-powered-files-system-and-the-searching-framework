e cell machinery, replicates itself, and then causes the cell to
burst, releasing a new generation of infectious phage viruses.
These new viruses infect and kill thousands of cells in the same
manner. A phage that replicates only by a lytic cycle is a
virulent phage.

In the lysogenic cycle, viruses replicate without destroying the
host cell. The phage virus becomes incorporated into a specific
site in the host’s DNA. It remains dormant within the host
genome and is called a prophage. As the host cell divides, the
phage is replicated along with it and a single infected cell gives
rise to a population of infected cells. At some point, an
environmental trigger causes the prophage to switch to the lytic
phase. Viruses capable of both modes of reproducing, lytic and
lysogenic, within a bacterium are called temperate viruses.

Viral replication can introduce genetic variation into its hosts.
RETROVIRUSES—These are viruses that contain
