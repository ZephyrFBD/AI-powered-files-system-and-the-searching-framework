1. A geneticist has discovered a yeast cell, which encodes a DNA polymerase that may add nucleotides in both
the 5聞 to 3聞 and 3聞 to 5聞 directions. Which of the following structures would this cell NOT likely generate during
DNA replication?
(A) RNA primers
(B) Okazaki fragments
(C) Replication fork
(D) Nicked DNA by topoisomerases
2. A eukaryotic gene, which does not normally undergo splicing, was exposed to benzopyrene, a known
