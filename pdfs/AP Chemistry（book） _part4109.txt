, and the sys-
tem is at equilibrium. (b) The reaction is spontaneous at tempera-
tures above 300 K. 19.10 (a) True (b) false (c) false (d) false (e) true  
19.11 Spontaneous: a, b, c, d; nonspontaneous: e 19.13 (a) True, 
assuming that the forward and reverse processes occur at the same 
conditions. (b) false (c) false (d) true (e) false 19.15 (a) Endothermic  
(b) above 100 °C (c) below 100 °C (d) at 100 °C 19.17 (a) No. Tem-
perature is a state function, so a change in temperature does not 
depend on pathway. (b) No. An isothermal process occurs at con-
stant temperature. (c) No. ∆E is a state function. 19.19 (a) An 
ice cube can melt reversibly at the conditions of temperature and 
pressure where the solid and liquid are in equilibrium. (b) No. 
We know that ∆H is a state function, and that melting is endo-
thermic.  Whether the ice cube melts reversibly or irreversibly, 
∆H for the process is not zero. 19.21 (a) True (b) false (c) true  
(d) false 19.23 (a) Entropy increases. (b)
