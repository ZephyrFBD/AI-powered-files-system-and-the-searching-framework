tes other plants and has no natural predators in
California, so it is an invasive species. Choice (A) is incorrect because if a keystone species is removed, the
entire ecosystem may collapse. Removing Scotch broom would most likely help the ecosystem, not cause it to
collapse. Scotch broom does not benefit other organisms in this ecosystem; therefore, it is not a mutualistic
species and choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because Scotch broom is not native to California.
10. (B) Ecosystems with more biodiversity are more likely to be able to recover from ecological disturbances.
Choice (A) is incorrect because a lower Simpson’s Diversity Index means less biodiversity and that ecosystem
would be less likely to recover from a disturbance. The difference in the two marshlands’ biodiversity will
result in different abilities to recover from the disturbance, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect
because while oil is toxic to all organisms, some organisms may be ab
