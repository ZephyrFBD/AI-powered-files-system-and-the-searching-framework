and the battery
emf is 12 V. Determine (a) the time constant, (b) the maximum charge the
capacitor could acquire, (c) the time it takes for the charge to reach 99% of this
value, and (d) the maximum current.
APPROACH We use Fig. 19–20 and Eqs. 19–7a, b, c, and d.
SOLUTION (a) The time constant is 
(b) The maximum charge would occur when no further current flows, so
(c) In Eq. 19–7b, we set
