 food. Also, these organisms have
bioprotective effects. How can addition of bacteria to the intestine protect the host from disease?
(A) Probiotic bacteria crowd the intestine, preventing pathogenic bacteria from growing due to density-
dependent limitation on their population.
(B) Probiotic bacteria crowd the intestine, preparing a niche for pathogenic bacteria to grow.
(C) Bacteria populations grow exponentially until the carrying capacity is reached.
(D) Pathogenic bacteria do not recognize the intestinal cells because they are coated with probiotic bacteria.
Summary
Behavior
Behavior is an organismâ€™s response to the environment. Behavior can be instinctual (inborn), learned, or social.
Types of social behaviors include agonistic behavior, dominance hierarchies, territoriality, and altruistic
behavior.
There are also plant-specific behaviors known as tropisms. The three basic tropisms are phototropism,
gravitropism, and thigmotropism.
Ecology
There are several major biomes (tundra,
