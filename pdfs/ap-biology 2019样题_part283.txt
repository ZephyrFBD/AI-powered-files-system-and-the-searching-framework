Science Practice 4: Represent and describe data.
The analysis of different types of graphs is a skill that 
will help students to succeed in the course and on the 
AP Exam. Students should appropriately label a graph 
and correctly plot data. During this course, students 
should master the skill of communicating the data they 
collect during their investigations. They should learn 
not only how to create a graph but also how to create 
the appropriate graph for a given set of data. Frequent 
practice analyzing different types of data to identify 
patterns, connect variables, and perform statistical 
analysis is important for their success.
