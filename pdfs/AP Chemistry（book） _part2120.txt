SATURATED SOLUTIONS AND SOLUBILITY (SECTION 13.2) The 
equilibrium between a saturated solution and undissolved solute 
is dynamic; the process of solution and the reverse process, crys-
tallization, occur simultaneously. In a solution in equilibrium with 
undissolved solute, the two processes occur at equal rates, giving 
a saturated solution. If there is less solute present than is needed to 
saturate the solution, the solution is unsaturated. When solute con-
centration is greater than the equilibrium concentration value, the 
solution is supersaturated. This is an unstable condition, and sepa-
ration of some solute from the solution will occur if the process is 
initiated with a solute seed crystal. The amount of solute needed 
to form a saturated solution
