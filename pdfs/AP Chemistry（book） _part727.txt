. The enthalpy change for a reaction depends on the states of the reac-
tants and products. If the product in Equation 5.17 were H2O1g2 instead of 
H2O1l2, ∆Hrxn would be -802 kJ instead of -890 kJ. Less heat would be available for 
transfer to the surroundings because the enthalpy of H2O1g2 is greater than that of 
H2O1l2. One way to see this is to imagine that the product is initially liquid water. 
The liquid water must be converted to water vapor, and the conversion of 2 mol 
H2O1l2 to 2 mol H2O1g2 is an endothermic process that absorbs 88 kJ:
 
2 H2O1l2 ¡  2 H2O1g2   ∆H = +88 kJ 
[5.19]
Thus, it is important to specify the states of the reactants and products in 
 
thermochemical equations. In addition, we will generally assume that the reactants 
and products are both at the same temperature, 25 °C, unless  
otherwise indicated.
