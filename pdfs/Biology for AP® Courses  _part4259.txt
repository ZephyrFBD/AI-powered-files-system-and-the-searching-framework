increase from its low minimum concentration to its higher maximum concentration. However, starting recently, atmospheric
carbon dioxide concentrations have increased beyond the historical maximum of 300 ppm. The current increases in
atmospheric carbon dioxide have happened very quicklyâ€”in a matter of hundreds of years rather than thousands of years.
What is the reason for this difference in the rate of change and the amount of increase in carbon dioxide? A key factor that
must be recognized when comparing the historical data and the current data is the presence of modern human society; no
other driver of climate change has yielded changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels at this rate or to this magnitude.
Human activity releases carbon dioxide and methane, two of the most important greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere in
several ways. The primary mechanism that releases carbon dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels, such as gasoline, coal, and
natural gas (Figure 35.29). De
