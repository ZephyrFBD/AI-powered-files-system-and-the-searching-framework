 to
regenerate RuBP.
c.
The Calvin cycle harnesses energy in the form of
3 ATP and 3 NADPH that are used to produce
Glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate (GA3P)
molecules. These store the energy captured from
photosynthesis. The cycle uses this energy to
regenerate the RuBP.
d.
The Calvin cycle harnesses energy in the form of
6 ATP and 3 NADPH that are used to produce
Glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate (GA3P)
molecules. These store energy captured from
photosynthesis. The cycle uses this energy to
regenerate RuBP.
40. Based on Figure 8.18, which would most likely cause
a plant to run out of NADP?
a.
missing the ATP synthase enzyme
b.
exposure to light
c.
A lack of water would prevent H+ and NADP+
from forming NADPH
d.
not enough CO2
41. As temperatures increase, gases such as CO2 diffuse
faster. As a result, plant leaves will lose CO2 at a faster
rate than normal. If the amount of light impacting on the
leaf and the amount of water available is adequate, predict
how this loss of gas will affect photosy
