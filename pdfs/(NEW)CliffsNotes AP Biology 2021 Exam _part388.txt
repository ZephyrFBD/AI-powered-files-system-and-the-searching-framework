t a promoter region on the DNA. RNA polymerase directs RNA
nucleotides to base-pair with the DNA fragment that represents the gene. If a fragment of DNA contained the
nucleotide sequence adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, the RNA nucleotides that would base-pair with it are
uracil, guanine, cytosine, and adenine, respectively. The products of transcription are three kinds of RNA—mRNA,
tRNA, and rRNA.
b. The mRNA contains the code for the polypeptide. Noncoding intervening sequences, called introns, are removed
and the mRNA is stabilized with a 5′ cap and a poly-A tail. The mRNA then moves to the cytoplasm.
c. Translation occurs in the cytoplasm and describes the actual assembly of amino into proteins. It requires all three
kinds of RNA—rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA.
First, ribosomes, consisting of rRNA and proteins, attach to the mRNA. Then a tRNA attaches to the ribosome.
There are various kinds of tRNA molecules. Each kind is specific for a particular amino acid that attaches to one end
