dependent reactions occur, and stroma, where the light-independent
reactions occur. The grana consist of layers of membranes called
thylakoids, the site of photosystems I and II. The chloroplast is enclosed
by a double membrane. Figure 7.4 is a sketch of a chloroplast.

Photosynthesis first evolved in prokaryotes. Scientific evidence supports the idea that
this early photosynthesis produced our oxygenated atmosphere.

PHOTOSYSTEMS
Photosystems are light-harvesting complexes in the thylakoid membranes
of chloroplasts. There are a few hundred photosystems in each thylakoid.
Each photosystem consists of a reaction center containing chlorophyll a
and a region containing several hundred antenna pigment molecules that
funnel energy into chlorophyll a. Two types of photosystems, PS I and PS
II, cooperate in the light reactions of photosynthesis. They are named in
the order in which they were discovered and not for the order in which
they function. PS II operate
