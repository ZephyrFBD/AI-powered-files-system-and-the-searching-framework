 it is found
that light with wavelengths shorter than 226 nm will cause
the diamond to conduct. What is the energy gap between
the valence band and the conduction band for diamond?
47. The energy gap between valence and conduction bands in
zinc sulfide is 3.6 eV. What range of wavelengths can a
photon have to excite an electron from the top of the
valence band into the conduction band?

48. Most of the Sun’s radiation has wavelengths shorter than
1100 nm. For a solar cell to absorb all this, what energy gap
ought the material have?
49. A TV remote control emits IR light. If the detector on the
TV set is not to react to visible light, could it make use of
silicon as a “window” with its energy gap 
What is the shortest-wavelength light that can strike silicon
without causing electrons to jump from the valence band to
the conduction band?
