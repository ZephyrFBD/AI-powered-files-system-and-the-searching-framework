 of grams of sulfuric acid, lead(II) acetate, lead(II) sulfate, and 
acetic acid present in the mixture after the  
reaction is complete.
 3.83 When benzene 1C6H62 reacts with bromine 1Br22, bromo-
benzene 1C6H5Br2 is obtained:
 
 
C6H6 + Br2 ยก C6H5Br + HBr
 
 (a) When 30.0 g of benzene reacts with 65.0 g of bromine, what 
is the theoretical yield of bromobenzene? (b) If the  
actual yield 
of bromobenzene is 42.3 g, what is the percentage yield?
 3.84  When ethane 1C2H62 reacts with chlorine 1Cl22, the main 
product is C2H5Cl, but other products containing Cl, such 
as C2H4Cl2, are also obtained in small quantities. The for-
mation of these other products reduces the yield of C2H5Cl.  
(a) Calculate the theoretical yield of C2H5Cl when 125 g of 
C2H6 reacts with 255 g of Cl2, assuming that C2H6 and Cl2 
react only to form C2H2Cl and HCl. (b) Calculate the percent 
yield of C2H5Cl if the reaction produces 206 g of C2H5Cl.
 3.85  Hydrogen sulfide is an impurity in natural gas that must
