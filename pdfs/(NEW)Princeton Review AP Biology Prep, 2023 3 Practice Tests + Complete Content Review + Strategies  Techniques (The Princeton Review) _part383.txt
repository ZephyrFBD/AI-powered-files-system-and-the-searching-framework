tor. Today, we find support for the theory of evolution in several areas:
Paleontology, or the study of fossils: paleontology has revealed to us both the great variety of organisms (most
of which, including trilobites, dinosaurs, and the woolly mammoth, have died off) and the major lines of
evolution. Fossils can be dated by:
i. The age of the rocks where a fossil is found
ii. The rate of decay of isotopes including carbon-14
iii. Geographical data
Biogeography, or the study of the distribution of flora (plants) and fauna (animals) in the environment:
scientists have found related species in widely separated regions of the world. For example, Darwin observed
that animals in the Galápagos have traits similar to those of animals on the mainland of South America. One
possible explanation for these similarities is a common ancestor. As we’ll see below, there are other
explanations for similar traits. However, when organisms share multiple traits, it’s pretty safe to say that they
likely al
