 mRNA. 
(B) A larger volume of blood circulates through a 
rabbit than through a frog. 
(C) The subunits of hemoglobin differ in size, 
shape, or charge. 
(D) Synthesis of b-hemoglobin occurs at a faster 
rate in muscle cells than in other body cells. 
 
31. Given that equal amounts of the different mRNAs 
were injected into fertilized frog eggs, which of 
the following conclusions is most consistent with 
the electrophoresis results? 
(A) b-hemoglobin mRNA is translated more 
efficiently than is a-hemoglobin mRNA. 
(B) a-hemoglobin is present only in cells where 
b-hemoglobin is absent. 
(C) a-hemoglobin mRNA is more stable than  
b-hemoglobin mRNA. 
(D) Tubulin inhibits translation of hemoglobin 
mRNA.
