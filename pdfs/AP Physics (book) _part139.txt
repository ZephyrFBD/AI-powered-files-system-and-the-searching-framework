2–2 Average Velocity
An important aspect of the motion of a moving object is how fast it is 
moving—its speed or velocity.
The term “speed” refers to how far an object travels in a given time interval,
regardless of direction. If a car travels 240 kilometers (km) in 3 hours (h), we say
its average speed was 
In general, the average speed of an object is
defined as the total distance traveled along its path divided by the time it takes to
travel this distance:
(2;1)
The terms “velocity” and “speed” are often used interchangeably in ordi-
nary language. But in physics we make a distinction between the two. Speed is
simply a positive number, with units. Velocity, on the other hand, is used to
signify both the magnitude (numerical value) of how fast an object is moving
and also the direction in which it is moving. Velocity is therefore a vector.
average speed = distance traveled
