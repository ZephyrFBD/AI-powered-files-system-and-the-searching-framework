l groups, the charge becomes less positive.
The DNA molecule itself can also be modified. This occurs within very specific regions called CpG islands. These are
stretches with a high frequency of cytosine and guanine dinucleotide DNA pairs (CG) found in the promoter regions of
genes. When this configuration exists, the cytosine member of the pair can be methylated (a methyl group is added). This
modification changes how the DNA interacts with proteins, including the histone proteins that control access to the region.

Highly methylated (hypermethylated) DNA regions with deacetylated histones are tightly coiled and transcriptionally
inactive.

spacing and gene expression. (credit: modification of work by NIH)
This type of gene regulation is called epigenetic regulation. Epigenetic means “around genetics.” The changes that occur
to the histone protei
