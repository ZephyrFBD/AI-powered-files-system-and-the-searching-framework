e plate.
3. Anaphase I—homologous chromosomes separate and sister chromatids stay together.
4. Telophase I—the movement of chromosomes to the poles is completed.
C. Meiosis II occurs in each of the two new cells after meiosis I is completed. No DNA replication occurs
between meiosis I and meiosis II. In meiosis II, the two cells once again go through four stages of
division:
1. Prophase II—the chromosomes are already condensed and new spindle fibers form.
2. Metaphase II—each pair of chromatids lines up in the middle of the cell, and kinetochore fibers attach
to the centromeres of each pair.
3. Anaphase II—the centromeres holding the chromatids together split, and one chromatid moves to each
side of the cell.
4. Telophase II—nuclear envelopes re-form around the chromosomes.
D. Cytokinesis follows telophase II, resulting in gametes.
1. If sperm are produced, meiosis usually produces four sperm cells.
2. If ova are produced, meiosis often produces a single egg cell, while the other three
