Figure 34.4 Sea stars can reproduce through fragmentation. The large arm, a fragment from another sea star, is
developing into a new individual.
Note that in fragmentation, there is generally a noticeable difference in the size of the individuals, whereas in fission, two
individuals of approximate size are formed.
Parthenogenesis
Parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction where an egg develops into a complete individual without being
fertilized. The resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid, depending on the process and the species.
Parthenogenesis occurs in invertebrates such as w
