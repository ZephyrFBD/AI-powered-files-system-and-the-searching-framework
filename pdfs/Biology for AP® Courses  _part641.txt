We know that the temperature of the
environment is sensed by E. coli through the
temperature-dependent confirmation of enzymes
that convert a single bond in the lipid tail to a
double bond, and vice versa. Explain how the
discovery of a mutant strain of E. coli could lead
to this insight.

Big Ideas 2, 4, and 1.
40. Aquaporins that allow for the movement of water
across a cell membrane are gated. Both low and high pH
within a plant cell can cause alterations of the membrane-
spanning protein. Describe the advantage of this feedback
mechanism. Predict how conditions of flooding or
drought could activate this mechanism.
41. Rice plants grown in high-salt environments can
actively transport sodium ions into the vacuole by the
antiporter movement of protons out of the vacuole. In a
study aimed at the development of salt-tolerant rye,
researchers produced several varieties of transgenic rye.
