Rain and surface runoff are major ways in which minerals, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, are cycled
from land to water. The environmental effects of runoff will be discussed later as these cycles are described.
Figure 37.15 Water from the land and oceans enters the atmosphere by evaporation or sublimation, where it
