 a set of closely spaced fine wires immersed in
a gas (Fig. 30–16). Many wires are grounded, and the others between are kept at
very high voltage. A charged particle passing through produces ions in the 
gas. Freed electrons drift toward the nearest high voltage wire, creating an
“avalanche” of many more ions, and producing an electric pulse or signal at that
wire. The positions of the particles are determined electronically by the position
of the wire and by the time it takes the pulses to reach “readout” electronics at
the ends of the wires. The paths of the particles are reconstructed electronically
by computers which can “draw” a picture of the tracks, as shown in Fig. 32–15,
Chapter 32. An external magnetic field curves the paths, allowing the momentum
of the particles to be measured.
Many detectors are also calorimeters which measure the energy of the
particles.
