mRNA?
Control of RNA Stability
Before the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is given two protective "caps" that prevent the end of the strand from degrading
during its journey. The 5' cap, which is placed on the 5' end of the mRNA, is usually composed of a methylated guanosine
triphosphate molecule (GTP). The poly-A tail, which is attached to the 3' end, is usually composed of a series of adenine
nucleotides. Once the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm, the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled.
Each RNA molecule has a defined lifespan and decays at a specific rate. This rate of decay can influence how much
protein is in the cell. If the decay rate is increased, the RNA will not exist in the cytoplasm as long, shortening the time for
translation to occur. Conversely, if the rate of decay is decreased, the RNA molecule will reside in the cytoplasm longer and
more protein can be translated. This rate of decay is referred to as the RNA stability. If the RNA is stable, it
