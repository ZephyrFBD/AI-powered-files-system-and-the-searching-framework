 of gills attach to a
structure called a columnar gill arch, forming a tall V. Water travels in from the outside of the V,
between each gill, then travels out of the top of the V. Veins travel into the gill from the base of the
gill arch, and arteries travel back out on the opposite side. A close-up image of a single gill shows
that water travels over the gill, passing over deoxygenated veins first, then over oxygenated
arteries.

Tracheal Systems
Insect respiration is independent of its circulatory system; therefore, the blood does not play a direct role in oxygen
transport. Insects have a highly specialized type of respiratory system called the tracheal system, which consists of a
network of small tubes that carries oxygen to the entire body. The tracheal system is the most direct and efficient respiratory
system in active animals. The tub
