 [3.13] 
Let’s calculate the mass of CO2 produced when 1.00 g of C4H10 is burned. The coefficients 
in Equation 3.13  tell us how the amount of C4H10 consumed is related to the amount 
of CO2 produced: 2 mol C4H10 ] 8 mol CO2. To use this stoichiometric relationship, we 
must convert grams of C4H10 to moles using the molar mass of C4H10, 58.0 g>mol:
 Moles C4H10 = 11.00 g C4H102a 1 mol C4H10
58.0 g C4H10
b
  = 1.72 * 10-2 mol C4H10
We then use the stoichiometric factor from the balanced equation to calculate moles of CO2:
 Moles CO2 = 11.72 * 10-2 mol C4H102a 8 mol CO2
2 mol C4H10
b
 = 6.88 * 10-2 mol CO2
Finally, we use the molar mass of CO2, 44.0 g>mol, to calculate the CO2 mass in grams:
 Grams CO2 = 16.88 * 10-2 mol CO22a
44.0 g CO2
1 mol CO2
b
 = 3.03 g CO2
