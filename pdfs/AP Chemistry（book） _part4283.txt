 model A model of reaction rates based on the idea 
that molecules must collide to react; it explains the factors 
influencing reaction rates in terms of the frequency of 
collisions, the number of collisions with energies exceeding the 
activation energy, and the probability that the collisions occur 
with suitable orientations. (Section 14.5)
colloids (colloidal dispersions) Mixtures containing particles 
larger than normal solutes but small enough to remain 
suspended in the dispersing medium. (Section 13.6)
combination reaction A chemical reaction in which two or more 
substances combine to form a single product. (Section 3.2)
combustion reaction A chemical reaction that proceeds with 
evolution of heat and usually also a flame; most combustion 
involves reaction with oxygen, as in the burning of a match.

common-ion effect A shift of an equilibrium induced by an ion 
common to the equilibrium. Whenever a weak electrolyte and 
a strong electrolyte containing a common
