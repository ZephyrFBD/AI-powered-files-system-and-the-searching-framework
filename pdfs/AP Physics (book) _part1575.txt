emains in a liquid state for a wide range of
temperatures.
(c) Water has a high bulk modulus.
(d) Water has a high specific heat.
12. Two equal-mass liquids, initially at the same temperature, are
heated for the same time over the same stove. You measure
the temperatures and find that one liquid has a higher tempera-
ture than the other. Which liquid has the higher specific heat?
(a) The cooler one.
(b) The hotter one.
(c) Both are the same.

1. (I) To what temperature will 8200 J of heat raise 3.0 kg of
water that is initially at 10.0°C?
2. (I) How much heat (in joules) is required to raise the
temperature of 34.0 kg of water from 15°C to 95°C?
3. (II) When a diver jumps into the ocean, water leaks into
the gap region between the diver’s skin and her wetsuit,
forming a water layer about 0.5 mm thick. Assuming the
total surface area of the wetsuit covering the diver is about
and that ocean water enters the suit at 10°C and is
warmed by the diver to skin te
