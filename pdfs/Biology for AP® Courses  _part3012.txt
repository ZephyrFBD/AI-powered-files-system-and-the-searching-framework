 of fumarase
needed for chemical digestion of food as well as
other involuntary responses like peristalsis.
b.
Neural responses facilitate secretion of enzymes
that are needed to digest or break down food as
well as other involuntary responses like
segmentation in stomach.
c.
Neural responses facilitate secretion of enzymes
needed to digest or break down food as well as
other involuntary responses like peristalsis.
d.
Neural responses facilitate secretion of salivary
amylase needed to digest or break down food as
well as secretion of hormones like secretin and
gastrin.
53. How do hormones regulate digestion?
a.
Hormones regulate aspects of digestion such as
increasing the peristaltic movements in the
esophagus when food is sensed.
b.
Hormones regulate digestion by signaling when
the stomach is full or empty so that an individual
will consume food or stop eating.
c.
Hormones like gastrin, secretin,
adrenocorticotropic are released from the
pituitary to regulate which digestive secretion
