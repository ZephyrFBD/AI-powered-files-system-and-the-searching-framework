nt that has low levels of glucose and high levels of lactose. Predict the
level of expression of the lac operon in this environment.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
12. A student conducts an experiment in an effort to determine whether a specific bacterial operon is inducible or
repressible. The level of transcription of the operon was measured after the addition of different molecules to
the bacteriaâ€™s environment. Data are shown in the table.

(a) Describe what, if any, effect levels of fructose have on the level of transcription of the operon.
(b) Describe what, if any, effect levels of lysine have on the level of transcription of the operon.
(c) Make a claim about whether this operon is more likely inducible or repressible.
(d) Justify your claim from part (c) using evidence from the experiment and your knowledge of inducible and
repressible operons.
