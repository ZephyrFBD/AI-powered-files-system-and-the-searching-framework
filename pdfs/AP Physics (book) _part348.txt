Force exerted
on desk by hand
FIGURE 4;8 If your hand pushes
against the edge of a desk (the force
vector is shown in red), the desk
pushes back against your hand (this
force vector is shown in a different
color, violet, to remind us that this
force acts on a different object).

FIGURE 4;9 An example of
Newton’s third law: when an ice
skater pushes against the wall, the
wall pushes back and this force
causes her to accelerate away.
The force the desk exerts on your hand has the same magnitude as the force
your hand exerts on the desk. This is true not only if the desk is at rest but is true
even if the desk is accelerating due to the force your hand exerts.
As another demonstration of Newton’s third law, consider the ice skater in
Fig. 4–9. There is very little friction between her skates and the ice, so she will
move freely if a force is exerted on her. She pushes against the wall; and then s
