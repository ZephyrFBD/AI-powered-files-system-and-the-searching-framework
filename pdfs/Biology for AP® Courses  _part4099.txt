re responsible for axis formation. Mutations in these genes
leads to the loss of symmetry required for organism development.
Animal bodies have externally visible symmetry. However, the internal organs are not symmetric. For example, the heart
is on the left side and the liver on the right. The formation of the central left-right axis is an important process during

development. This internal asymmetry is established very early during development and involves many genes. Research is
still ongoing to fully understand the developmental implications of these genes.
