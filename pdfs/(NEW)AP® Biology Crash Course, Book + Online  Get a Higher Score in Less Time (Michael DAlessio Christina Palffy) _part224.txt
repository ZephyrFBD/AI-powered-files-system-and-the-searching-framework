 most flies were attracted to the white vinegar, the ripened fruit, and
the apple cider vinegar with dish soap. The least amount of flies were attracted to the salt, and the flies
probably were just checking out the substance briefly. Both the white vinegar and the ripened fruit
were similarly attractive to the fruit flies. Although the sugar is obviously sweet, it was dry and
crystalized and did not attract as many flies as the “sweet and wet” substances did. The apple cider
vinegar with the dish soap also attracted about the same amount of fruit flies as the other vinegar and
the ripened fruit; however, this substance also trapped most of the flies in the dish soap, while the
apple cider vinegar attracted the flies to their deaths.
