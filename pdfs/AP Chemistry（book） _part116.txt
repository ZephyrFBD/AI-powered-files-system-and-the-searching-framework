.1 to be quite similar. Ethanol is the alcohol 
in beverages such as beer and wine, whereas ethylene glycol is a viscous liquid used 
as automobile antifreeze. The properties of these two substances differ in many ways, 
as do their biological activities. Ethanol is consumed throughout the world, but you 
should never consume ethylene glycol because it is highly toxic. One of the challenges 
chemists undertake is to alter the composition or structure of molecules in a controlled 
way, creating new substances with different properties. For example, the common drug 
aspirin, shown in Figure 1.1, was first synthesized in 1897 in a successful attempt to 
improve on a natural product extracted from willow bark that had long been used to 
alleviate pain.
Every change in the observable world—from boiling water to the changes that 
occur as our bodies combat invading viruses—has its basis in the world of atoms 
and molecules. Thus, as we proceed with our study of chemistry, we will find our-
