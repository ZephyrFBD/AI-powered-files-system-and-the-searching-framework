This simplified phylogeny shows the currently accepted evolutionary history of vertebrates, which are part of the phylum
Chordata. How do differences in heart anatomy among these groups support this phylogeny?
a.
The anatomy of the heart among these groups shows a gradually increasing number of heart chambers across
the phylogeny. Fish have a two-chambered heart, amphibians and reptiles have a three-chambered heart,
where latter has a partial separation of ventricles. Birds and mammals both have four-chambered hearts.
