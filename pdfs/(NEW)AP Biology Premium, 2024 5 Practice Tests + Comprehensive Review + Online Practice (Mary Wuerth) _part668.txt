ion for cell division, so choice (C) is also incorrect. Choice (D) is
incorrect because during G2, the cell is making final preparations for mitosis.
28. (C) Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are present at near-constant levels throughout the cell cycle but do not
become active until they are bound to cyclins. The levels of cyclins rise and fall during the cell cycle. Choices
(A) and (B) are incorrect because cyclins are not present at near-constant levels during the cell cycle.
Phosphatases remove phosphate groups from compounds, which usually inactivates them, so choice (D) is
incorrect.
29. (B) Replication of the genetic material occurs during the S stage. Chromosomes align along the center of the
cell during metaphase. The chromatids of chromosomes separate during anaphase. Choice (A) is incorrect
because G1 and G2 are not the stages during which chromosomes align or separate. G2 is not when replication
of the genetic material occurs, and telophase involves the formation of two new n
