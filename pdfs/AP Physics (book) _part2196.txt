 force when placed in a mag-
netic field. Since a current in a wire consists of moving electric charges, we might
expect that freely moving charged particles (not in a wire) would also experience a
force when passing through a magnetic field. Free electric charges are not as easy to
produce in the lab as a current in a wire, but it can be done, and experiments do
show that moving electric charges experience a force in a magnetic field.
From what we already know, we can predict the force on a single electric charge
moving in a magnetic field 
If N such particles of charge q pass by a given point
in time , they constitute a current
We let be the time for a charge q
to travel a distance in a magnetic field 
then
where is the magnitude
of the velocity of the particle. Thus, the force on these N particles is, by Eq. 20â€“1,
The force on one of the N parti-
cles is then
(20;3)
This equation gives the magnitude of the force exerted by a magnetic field on a
particle of charge q moving with veloc
