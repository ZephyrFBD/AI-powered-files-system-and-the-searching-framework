83. A train traveling at a constant speed rounds a curve of
radius 215 m. A lamp suspended from the ceiling swings
out to an angle of 16.5° throughout the curve. What is the
speed of the train?
84. The Sun revolves around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy
(Fig. 5–49) at a distance of about 30,000 light-years from
the center  
If it takes about 200 mil-
lion years to make one revolution, estimate the mass of our
Galaxy. Assume that the mass distribution of our Galaxy 
is concentrated mostly in a central uniform sphere. If all the
stars had about the mass of our Sun
