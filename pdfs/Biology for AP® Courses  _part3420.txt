hereas hormonal stimuli are
hormones that stimulate other hormones.
c.
Both humoral and hormonal stimuli release
hormones. Humoral stimuli are extracellular
fluid-related stimuli, whereas hormonal stimuli
are hormones that stimulate other hormones.
d.
Both humoral and hormonal stimuli release
hormones. Humoral stimuli are hormones that
stimulate other hormones, whereas hormonal
stimuli are extracellular fluid-related stimuli.
48. Explain why it would be problematic if most hormones
were regulated by a positive feedback loop.
a.
Excessive production of actions would be
stimulated by hormones such as growth and
blood glucose levels.
b.
Production of actions would be reduced by
hormones such as growth and blood glucose
levels.
c.
Inhibition of GnRH production by increase in
gonad hormone levels.
d.
Inhibition of release of insulin by decrease in
blood glucose concentrations.
49. Identify what aldosterone regulates, and explain how it
is stimulated.
a.
Aldosterone regulates the amount of w
