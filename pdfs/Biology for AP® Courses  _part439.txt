some agents such as enzymes within
plant vacuoles break down macromolecules. The membrane of a vacuole does not fuse with the membranes of other cellular
components.
Animal Cells versus Plant Cells
At this point, you know that each eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, a nucleus, ribosomes, mitochondria,
peroxisomes, and in some, vacuoles, but there are some striking differences between animal and plant cells. While both
animal and plant cells have microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), animal cells also have centrioles associated with the
MTOC: a complex called the centrosome. Animal cells each have a centrosome and lysosomes, whereas most plant cells
do not. Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts and other specialized plastids, and a large central vacuole, whereas animal
cells do not.
The Centrosome
The centrosome is a microtubule-organizing center found near the nuclei of animal cells. It contains a pair of centrioles,
two structures that lie perpendicular to each o
