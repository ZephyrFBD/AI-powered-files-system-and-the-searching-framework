mperature increases (positive ∆T). 
Rearranging Equation 5.20, we get
 
q = Cs * m * ∆T 
[5.21]
Thus, we can calculate the quantity of heat a substance gains or loses by using its specific 
heat together with its measured mass and temperature change.
Table 5.2 lists the specific heats of several substances. Notice that the specific heat of 
liquid water is higher than those of the other substances listed. The high specific heat of 
water affects Earth’s climate because it makes the temperatures of the oceans relatively 
resistant to change.
Give It Some Thought
Which substance in Table 5.2 undergoes the greatest temperature change when the 
same mass of each substance absorbs the same quantity of heat?
