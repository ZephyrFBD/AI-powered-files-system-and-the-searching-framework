enal veins to
join the inferior vena cava. Each segmental renal
artery formed by the splitting of the renal
arteries splits again into interlobar arteries and
enters the renal columns. These again split to
form arcuate arteries, from which cortical radiate
arteries radiate out and branch into many
afferent arterioles that enter the capillaries
supplying the nephrons. Veins trace the path of
arteries and have all the same names as the
arteries following the same path.
