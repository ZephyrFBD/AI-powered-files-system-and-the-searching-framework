kely see questions on the AP Biology exam about
the concepts covered in the two biotechnology investigations (the
other one, AP Biology Lab 9, is covered in chapter 16)—along with
other techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.
Be sure that you familiarize yourself with the general procedures
and purposes of using these techniques.
6.6 Investigate bacterial transformation gene transfer
This investigation deals with the transformation of bacteria using
plasmids that contain known genes. Bacteria can incorporate plasmids
aȇer being shocked by a chemical, temperature, or electrical pulses. Heat
shock followed by an ice bath allows the plasmid DNA to penetrate the
cell wall more easily. As long as the gene from the plasmid inserts aȇer a
promoter region, it will be expressed as part of the new, recombined
bacterial genome.
The common example is to take plasmids that contain an ampicillin-
resistance gene and transform b
