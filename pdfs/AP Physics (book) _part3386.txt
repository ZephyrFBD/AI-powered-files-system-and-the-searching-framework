Carbon-14 dating
Organisms cannot distinguishâ€ 
from 
and because the ratio of 
to 
in the atmosphere remains nearly constant, the ratio of the two isotopes within
the living organism remains nearly constant as well. When an organism dies,
carbon dioxide is no longer taken in and utilized. Because the 
decays
radioactively, the ratio of 
to 
in a dead organism decreases over time. The
half-life of 
is about 5730 yr, so the 
ratio decreases by half every 
5730 yr. If, for example, the 
ratio of an ancient wooden tool is half of
what it is in living trees, then the object must have been made from a tree that
was felled about 5730 years ago.
Actually, corrections must be made for the fact that the 
ratio in the
atmosphere has not remained precisely constant over time. The determination of
what this ratio has been over the centurie
