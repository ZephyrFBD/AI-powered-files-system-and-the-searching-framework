ich climber is more likely to 
be hurt?
86. A coffee cup on the horizontal dashboard of a car slides
forward when the driver decelerates from 
to rest
in 3.5 s or less, but not if she decelerates in a longer time.
What is the coefficient of static friction between the cup
and the dash? Assume the road and the dashboard are
level (horizontal).
87. A roller coaster reaches the top of the steepest hill with a
speed of 
It then descends the hill, which is at an
average angle of 45° and is 45.0 m long. What will its speed
be when it reaches the bottom? Assume
88. A motorcyclist is coasting with the engine off at a steady
speed of 
but enters a sandy stretch where the
coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.70. Will the cyclist emerge
from the sandy stretch without having to start the engine if
the sand lasts for 15 m? If so, what will be the speed upon
emerging?
89. The 70.0-kg climber in Fig. 4–72 is supported in the
“chimney” by the friction forces exerted on his shoes and
back. The static c
