FIGURE 33–29 Compressed graphical representation of the development of the universe
after the Big Bang, according to modern cosmology. [The time scale is mostly logarithmic
(each factor of 10 in time gets equal treatment), except at the start (there can be no 
on a log scale), and during inflation (to save space).] The vertical 
height is a rough indication of the size of the universe, mainly to 
suggest expansion of the universe: Early on (after inflation) 
the universe is decelerating in its expansion (note slight 
downward curve); but for the last 7 Gyr
