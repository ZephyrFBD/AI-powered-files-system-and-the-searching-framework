CHAPTER 17 Additional Aspects of Aqueous Equilibria
Selective Precipitation of Ions
Ions can be separated from each other based on the solubilities of their salts. Con-
sider a solution containing both Ag+ and Cu2 +. If HCl is added to the solution, AgCl 
1Ksp = 1.8 * 10-102 precipitates, while Cu2 +  remains in solution because CuCl2 is solu-
ble. Separation of ions in an aqueous solution by using a reagent that forms a precipitate 
with one or more (but not all) of the ions is called selective precipitation.
Sulfide ion is often used to separate metal ions because the solubilities of sul-
fide salts span a wide range and depend greatly on solution pH. For example, Cu2 +  
and Zn2 +  can be separated by bubbling H2S gas through an acidified solution con-
taining these two cations. Because CuS 1Ksp = 6 * 10-372 is less soluble than ZnS 
1Ksp = 2 * 10-252, CuS precipitates from an acidifie
