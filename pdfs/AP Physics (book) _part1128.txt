81. Suppose a person can reduce the pressure in his lungs to
gauge pressure. How high can water then be
“sucked” up a straw?
82. A bicycle pump is used to inflate a tire. The initial tire
(gauge) pressure is 210 kPa (30 psi). At the end of the
pumping process, the final pressure is 310 kPa (45 psi). If
the diameter of the plunger in the cylinder of the pump is
2.5 cm, what is the range of the force that needs to be
applied to the pump handle from beginning to end?
83. Estimate the pressure on the mountains underneath the
Antarctic ice sheet, which is typically 2 km thick.
84. A simple model (Fig. 10–56) considers a continent as a
block 
floating in the mantle rock
around it
Assuming the continent
is 35 km thick (the average thickness of the Earth’s conti-
nental crust), estimate the height of the continent above
the surrounding mantle rock.
