eceive energy from the Sun
either directly or indirectly:
Producers, or autotrophs, are organisms that can make their own food using energy captured from the Sun. They
convert this into chemical energy that is stored in high-energy molecules like glucose.
Consumers, or heterotrophs, must obtain their energy from organic molecules in their environment. They can
then take this energy to make the organic molecules they need to survive.
Biomass is a measure of the mass of living matter in an environment. It can be used to estimate the energy
present in an environment.
LAB 11: TRANSPIRATION
This lab investigates the mechanisms of transpiration, the movement of water from a plant to the atmosphere
through evaporation. What do you need to take away from this lab?
The special properties of water that allow it to move through a plant from the roots to the leaves include
polarity, hydrogen bonding, cohesion, and adhesion.
Know the vascular tissues that are involved in transport in plants. Xylem
