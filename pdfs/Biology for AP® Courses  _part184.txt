Covalent bonds form between atoms when they share electrons to fill their valence electron shells. When the sharing
of electrons between atoms is equal, such as O2 (oxygen) or CH4 (methane), the covalent bond is said to be nonpolar.
However, when electrons are shared, but not equally due to differences in electronegativity (the tendency to attract

electrons), the covalent bond is said to be polar. H2O (water) is an example of a polar molecule. Because oxygen is more
electronegative than hydrogen, the electrons are drawn toward oxygen and away from the hydrogen atoms; consequently,
the oxygen atom acquires a slight negative charge and each hydrogen atoms acquires a slightly positive charge. It is
important to remember that the electrons are still shared, just not equally.
