 charge. The core electrons 
in each case largely screen the outermost electrons from 
the nucleus, so the effective nuclear charge does not vary 
greatly as we go to higher atomic numbers. However, the 
principal quantum number, n, of the outermost electrons 
steadily increases, with a corresponding increase in orbital 
radius.
(c) The contrast between the properties of bismuth and those 
of nitrogen and phosphorus illustrates the general rule that 
there is a trend toward increased metallic character as we 
move down in a given group. Bismuth, in fact, is a metal. 
The increased metallic character occurs because the outer-
most electrons are more readily lost in bonding, a trend that 
is consistent with its lower ionization energy.
(d) Following the procedures described in Section 4.2 for writing 
molecular and net ionic equations, we have the following:
Molecular equation:
Bi2O31s2 + 6 HNO31aq2 ยก 2 Bi1NO3231aq2 + 3 H2O1l2 
Net ionic equation:
Bi2O31s2 + 6 H+1aq2 ยก 2 Bi3 +1aq2 + 3 H2
