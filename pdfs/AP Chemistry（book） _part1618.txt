ation 10.20.
Solve We must convert each quantity in our equation to SI units. 
We will also use R in units of J>mol@K (Table 10.2) to make the 
units cancel correctly.
 T = 25 + 273 = 298 K
 ℳ= 28.0 g>mol = 28.0 * 10-3 kg>mol

Comment This corresponds to a speed of 1150 mi>hr. Because the 
average molecular weight of air molecules is slightly greater than 
that of N2, the rms speed of air molecules is a little smaller than 
that for N2.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Fill in the blanks for the following statement: The rms 
speed of the molecules in a sample of H2 gas at 300 K will be 
 times larger than the rms speed of O2 molecules 
at the same temperature, and the ratio urms1H22>urms1O22 
 with increasing temperature.  
(a) four, will not change (b) four, will increase (c) sixteen, 
will not change (d) sixteen, will decrease (e) Not enough
