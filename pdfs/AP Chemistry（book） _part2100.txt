 m solution of 
KCl, for example, freezes at -0.344 °C.
The difference between expected and observed colligative prop-
erties for strong electrolytes is due to electrostatic attractions between 
ions. As the ions move about in solution, ions of opposite charge col-
lide and “stick together” for brief moments. While they are together, 
they behave as a single particle called an ion pair (Figure 13.24). 
The number of independent particles is thereby reduced, causing a 
SOLUTION
Analyze Our goal is to calculate the molar mass of a high- 
molecular-mass protein, based on the osmotic pressure and a 
knowledge of the mass of protein and solution volume. Since the 
protein will be considered as a nonelectrolyte, i = 1.
Plan The temperature 1T = 25 °C2 and osmotic pressure 
1Π = 1.54 torr2 are given, and we know the value of R so we can
