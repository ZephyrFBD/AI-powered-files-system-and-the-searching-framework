t the bodyâ€™s ability to fix mistakes in its DNA decreases as we age. How can this affect DNA
replication?
a.
Aging causes accumulation of DNA mutations and DNA damage of only the nuclear DNA and the mistakes
will be passed down to new cells causing age related diseases.
b.
Aging results in ineffective DNA repair mechanism so that the mistakes in the DNA will be passed down to
new cells. This could lead to the development of age-related diseases.
c.
Aging causes DNA polymerase to function abnormally. This is the sole reason which causes defects in DNA
replication.
d.
DNA replication of only fast growing cells is affected by aging.
Activity
Design (but do not implement) an experiment to test the three models of DNA replication. Summarize the
results you would expect if each of the three models of DNA replication were correct. Assume you have
access in a laboratory to the following: an experimental organism such as E. coli, an unlimited variety of
isotopes, test tube and centrifuge, and o
