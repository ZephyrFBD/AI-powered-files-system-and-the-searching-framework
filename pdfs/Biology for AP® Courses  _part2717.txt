 and other organs
physiological process that leads to the fall of a plant organ (such as leaf or petal drop)
aboveground root that arises from a plant part other than the radicle of the plant embryo
bud formed at the tip of the shoot
meristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots; enables a plant to extend in length
plant hormone that influences cell elongation (in phototropism), gravitropism, apical dominance and root growth
bud located in the axil: the stem area where the petiole connects to the stem
tough, waterproof, outer epidermal layer of cork cells
modified underground stem that consists of a large bud surrounded by numerous leaf scales
waxy coating that forces water to cross endodermal plasma membranes before entering the vascular
cylinder, instead of moving between endodermal cells
molecule that absorbs light
elongated plant cell with unevenly thickened walls; provides structural support to the stem and leaves
phloem cell that is connected to sieve-tube cells; has
