arges up to the battery emf.
(c) The capacitor eventually charges up to the full battery
emf at a rate determined by R and C.
(d) The capacitor charges up to a fraction of the battery
emf determined by R and C.
(e) The capacitor charges up to a fraction of the battery
emf determined by R only.

11. The capacitor in the circuit shown in Fig. 19–47 is charged
to an initial value Q. When the switch is closed, it discharges
through the resistor. It takes 2.0 seconds for the charge to
drop to
How long does it take to drop to
(a) 3.0 seconds.
(b) 4.0 seconds.
(c) Between 2.0 and 3.0 seconds.
(d) Between 3.0 and 4.0 seconds.
(e) More than 4.0 seconds.
