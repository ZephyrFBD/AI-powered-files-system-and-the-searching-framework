ral, regulatory, contractile, or protective; they may serve in transport, storage,
or membranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes. Each cell in a living system may contain thousands of proteins, each
with a unique function. Their structures, like their functions, vary greatly. They are all, however, polymers of amino acids,
arranged in a linear sequence.
Enzymes, which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually complex
or conjugated proteins. Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) it acts on. The enzyme
may help in breakdown, rearrangement, or synthesis reactions. Enzymes that break down their substrates are called catabolic
enzymes, enzymes that build more complex molecules from their substrates are called anabolic enzymes, and enzymes that
affect the rate of reaction are called catalytic enzymes. It should be noted that all enzymes increase the rate of reaction
and, therefore, are consi
