attraction. The kinetic energies, which depend on temperature, 
tend to keep the particles apart and moving. The interparticle attractions tend to draw 
the particles together. Substances that are gases at room temperature have much weaker 
interparticle attractions than those that are liquids; substances that are liquids have 
weaker interparticle attractions than those that are solids. The different states of matter 
adopted by the halogens at room temperature—iodine is a solid, bromine is a liquid, and 
chlorine is a gas—are a direct consequence of a decrease in the strength of the intermo-
lecular forces as we move from I2 to Br2 to Cl2.
We can change a substance from one state to another by heating or cooling, which 
changes the average kinetic energy of the particles. NaCl, for example, a solid at room tem-
perature, melts at 1074 K and boils at 1686 K under 1 atm pressure, and Cl2, a gas at room 
temperature, liquefies at 239 K and solidifies at 172 K under 1 atm pressure. As th
