on follows a second-order rate law with a very large rate constant:
 
Rate = k3Cl43O34 k = 7.2 * 109 M-1 s-1 at 298 K 
[18.8]
Under certain conditions, the ClO generated in Equation 18.7 can react to regener-
ate free Cl atoms. One way that this can happen is by photodissociation of ClO:
 
ClO1g2 + hn ¡  Cl1g2 + O1g2 
[18.9]
The Cl atoms generated in Equations 18.6 and 18.9 can react with more O3, 
according to Equation 18.7. The result is a sequence of reactions that accomplishes the 
Cl-catalyzed decomposition of O3 to O2:
           2 Cl1g2 + 2 O31g2 ¡ 2 ClO1g2 + 2 O21g2
               2 ClO1g2 + hn ¡ 2 Cl1g2 + 2 O1g2
                O1g2 + O1g2 ¡ O21g2
 
2 Cl1g2 + 2 O31g2 + 2 ClO1g2 + 2 O1g2 ¡ 2 Cl1g2 + 2 ClO1g2 + 3 O21g2 + 2 O1g2
The equation can be simplified by eliminating like species from each side to give
 
2 O31g2 ¡

3 O21g2

Because the rate of Equation 18.7 increases linearly with [Cl], the rate at which ozone is 
destroyed increases as the quantity of Cl atoms i
