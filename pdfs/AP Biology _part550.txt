Which of the following statements correctly identifies the line in the
graph that represents an r-strategist and provides the correct

Line A represents an r-strategist because, as a result of

None of these lines fits the characterization of an r-strategist.
Which line on the graph characterizes an animal that releases
thousands of eggs at once into the sea to be fertilized externally?
Line A characterizes this type of animal because, as a result of
