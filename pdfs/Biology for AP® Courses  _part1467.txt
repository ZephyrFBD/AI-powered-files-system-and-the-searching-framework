11.
The figure represents a Drosophila linkage map for genes
A-E. The numbers between the gene loci are the relative
map units between each gene. Based on the linkage map,
which two genes are most likely to segregate together?
a.
A and B
b.
B and C
c.
C and D
d.
D and E
12. A test cross was made between true-breeding EEWW
flies and eeww flies. The resulting F1 generation was
then crossed with eeww flies. 100 offspring in the F2
generation were examined,
