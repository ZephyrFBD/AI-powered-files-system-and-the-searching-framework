I would
gather the seeds they produce and cross-pollinate the plants that
grow from those seeds. I would repeat this procedure a few
times with each new generation of seeds produced.
Each generation will produce plants with more and more
trichomes.
The phenotype of the plant (having lots of trichomes) is
evidence that the plant carries the genes for having many
trichomes. By selectively breeding plants that have many
trichomes, this experiment is selecting for plants that carry the
genes for having many trichomes.
This graph shows the process of directional selection. This is
when a population with one array of traits changes over time.
For example, the population could have changed from having
one color that predominates to having a different color that
predominates. Another example could be that the original
population was shorter and now the evolved population is taller.
No single individual changed; it was the percent of alleles in the
population that changed. Notice that both popu
