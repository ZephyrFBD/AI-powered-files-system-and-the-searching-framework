energy to overcome their attractive interactions. The process is therefore endothermic 
1∆Hsolute 7 02. Likewise, separation of solvent molecules to accommodate the solute 
always requires energy 1∆Hsolvent 7 02. The third component, which arises from the 
attractive interactions between solute particles and solvent particles, is always exother-
mic 1∆Hmix 6 02.
The three enthalpy terms in Equation 13.1 can be added together to give either a 
negative or a positive sum, depending on the actual numbers for the system being con-
sidered (Figure 13.4). Thus, the formation of a solution can be either exothermic or endo-
thermic. For example, when magnesium sulfate 1MgSO42 is added to water, the solution 
process is exothermic: ∆Hsoln = -91.2 kJ>mol. In contrast, the dissolution of ammo-
nium nitrate 1NH4NO32 is endothermic: ∆Hsoln = 26.4 kJ>mol. These particular salts 
are the main components in the instant heat packs and ice packs used to treat athletic 
injuries (Figure 13.5). The pac
