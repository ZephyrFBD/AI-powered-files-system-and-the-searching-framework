Sex-Linked Genes
Most genes are located on autosomes, chromosomes that are not directly involved in sex determination. Males and
females are equally likely to inherit genes located on autosomes. Sex chromosomes are involved in sex
determination, and genes on sex chromosomes have different inheritance patterns than genes on autosomes.
A special case of linked genes are sex-linked genes. Sex-linked genes are genes that are located on sex
chromosomes. Sex chromosomes are nonhomologous in humans; females typically have two X chromosomes, and
males have one X and one Y chromosome. For this reason, traits that are coded for by sex-linked recessive alleles
are more likely to be expressed in males since males have only one X chromosome. Females could also express a
sex-linked recessive trait, but since females have two X chromosomes, a female woul
