CHAPTER 6 Electronic Structure of Atoms
The Uncertainty Principle
The discovery of the wave properties of matter raised some new and interesting ques-
tions. Consider, for example, a ball rolling down a ramp. Using the equations of classical 
physics, we can calculate, with great accuracy, the ballâ€™s position, direction of motion, 
and speed at any instant. Can we do the same for an electron, which exhibits wave prop-
erties? A wave extends in space, and its location is not precisely defined. We might there-
fore anticipate that it is impossible to determine exactly where an electron is located at a 
specific instant.
The German physicist Werner Heisenberg (Figure 6.15) proposed that the dual nature 
of matter places a fundamental limitation on how precisely we can know both the loca-
tion and the momentum of an object at a given instant. The limitation becomes import-
ant only when we deal with matter at the subatomic level (that is, with masses as small as 
that
