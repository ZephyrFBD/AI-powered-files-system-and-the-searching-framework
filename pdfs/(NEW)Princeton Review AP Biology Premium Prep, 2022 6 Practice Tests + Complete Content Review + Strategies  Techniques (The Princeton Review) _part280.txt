wing graph and paragraph.
An experiment is performed to evaluate the amount of DNA present during a complete cell cycle. All of the cells
were synced prior to the start of the experiment. During the experiment, a fluorescent chemical was applied to cells,
which would fluoresce only when bound to DNA. The results of the experiment are shown above. Differences in
cell appearance by microscopy or changes in detected DNA were determined to be phases of the cell cycle and are
labeled with the letters Aâ€“D.
2. Approximately how long does S phase take to occur in these cells?
(A) 15 min
(B) 20 min
(C) 30 min
(D) 40 min
3. During which of the labeled phases of the experiment would the cell undergo anaphase?
(A) Phase A
(B) Phase B
(C) Phase C
(D) Phase D
4. Trisomy 21, which results in Down syndrome, results from nondisjunction of chromosome 21 in humans.
Nondisjunction occurs when two homologous chromosomes, or two sister chromatids, do not separate. Which
of the following describes the mechan
