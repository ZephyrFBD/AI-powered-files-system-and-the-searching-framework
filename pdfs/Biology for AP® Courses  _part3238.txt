r canals. Together, they make up what’s known as the vestibular labyrinth that is shown in Figure 27.15. The
utricle and saccule respond to acceleration in a straight line, such as gravity. The roughly 30,000 hair cells in the utricle
and 16,000 hair cells in the saccule lie below a gelatinous layer, with their stereocilia projecting into the gelatin. Embedded
in this gelatin are calcium carbonate crystals—like tiny rocks. When the head is tilted, the crystals continue to be pulled
straight down by gravity, but the new angle of the head causes the gelatin to shift, thereby bending the stereocilia. The
bending of the stereocilia stimulates the neurons, and they signal to the brain that the head is tilted, allowing the maintenance
of balance. It is the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve that deals with balance.
