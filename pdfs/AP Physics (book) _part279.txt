EXERCISE F In Example 3–6, what is (a) the velocity vector at the maximum height, and
(b) the acceleration vector at maximum height?
The wrong strategy. A boy on a small hill
aims his water-balloon slingshot horizontally, straight at a second boy hanging from
a tree branch a distance d away, Fig.3–24.At the instant the water balloon is released,
the second boy lets go and falls from the tree, hoping to avoid being hit. Show that
he made the wrong move. (He hadn’t studied physics yet.) Ignore air resistance.
RESPONSE Both the water balloon and the boy in the tree start falling at the
same instant, and in a time they each fall the same vertical distance
much like Fig. 3–19. In the time it takes the water balloon to travel the horizontal
distance d, the balloon will have the same y position as the falling boy. Splat. If
the boy had stayed in the tree, he would have avoided
