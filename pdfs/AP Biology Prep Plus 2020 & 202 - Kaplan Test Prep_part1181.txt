phic level B for a desert
ecosystem
Explain why ecosystems have a maximum
of 4–5 trophic levels
Divide energy at higher trophic level by
energy at lower trophic level: 22 ÷ 212 ≈
0.10 or 10%
Approximately 90% of the energy is lost
between trophic levels via respiration and
heat (2nd Law of Thermodynamics)
(d) An invasive predator was introduced in the temperate deciduous forest
ecosystem. Predict the short-term impact on the pyramid of biomass for
the ecosystem. Justify your prediction. (2 points maximum)
Prediction (1 point each, 1 point maximum)
Justification (1 point each, 1 point maximum)
Here is one possible response that would earn full credit:
An invasive predator introduced in the temperate deciduous forests has no
native predator and readily available food. If the predator feeds on organisms
in trophic level D, the biomass of trophic level D will decrease. In turn, the
number of organisms that organisms in trophic level D prey on will increase.
Thus, the biomass of trophic lev
