r disconnect the source
voltage to the drain and to the back of the subpixel (its front is fixed at 
).
The potential difference 
across a subpixel determines if that subpixel will be
bright in color 
, black (
maximum), or something in between. See
Fig.17–35. All the subpixel TFTs along the one activated horizontal wire (the orange
one in Fig. 17–33) will have 
at the gate: the TFTs are turned “on,” like a
switch.That allows electric charge to flow, connecting the vertical wire signal volt-
age at each TFT source to its drain and to the back of the subpixel. Thus all 
subpixels along one row receive the brightness needed for that line of the frame.
