32–3 Particles and Antiparticles
The positron, as we discussed in Sections 27–6 (pair production) and 30–5
(
decay), is basically a positive electron. That is, many of its properties are the
same as for the electron, such as mass, but it has the opposite electric charge
Other quantum numbers that we will discuss shortly are also reversed. The
positron is said to be the antiparticle to the electron.
The positron was first detected as a curved path in a cloud chamber in a
magnetic field by Carl Anderson in 1932. It was predicted that other particles
also would have antiparticles. It was decades before another type was found.

Finally, in 1955 the antiparticle to the proton, the antiproton
which carries a
negative charge (Fig. 32–11), was discovered at the University of California,
Berkeley, by Emilio Segrè (1905–1989, Fig. 32–12) and Owen Chamberlain 
(1920–2006). A bar, such as over
