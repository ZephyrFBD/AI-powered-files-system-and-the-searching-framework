concentration. Support your prediction by describing how a 
noncompetitive inhibitor affects the structure and function of an enzyme. 
•
•
Prediction (1 point)  
Noncompetitive/allosteric inhibitor will decrease the (initial) rate of reaction (at any 
substrate concentration) 
•
Support (1 point) 
Inhibitor binding to site other than active site (allosteric site) changes shape of enzyme, 
which alters the interaction of substrate with active site
