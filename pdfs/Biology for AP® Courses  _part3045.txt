Neurogenesis
At one time, scientists believed that people were born with all the neurons they would ever have. Research
performed during the last few decades indicates that neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons, continues into
adulthood. Neurogenesis was first discovered in songbirds that produce new neurons while learning songs.
For mammals, new neurons also play an important role in learning: about 1000 new neurons develop in the
hippocampus (a brain structure involved in learning and memory) each day. While most of the new neurons
will die, researchers found that an increase in the number of surviving new neurons in the hippocampus
correlated with how well rats learned a new task. Interestingly, exercise also promotes neurogenesis in the
hippocampus. Stress has the opposite effect. While neurogenesis is quite limited compared to regeneration
in other tissues, research in this area may lead to new treatments for disord
