andle is placed 36 cm in front of a converging
lens of focal length 
which in turn is 56 cm in
front of another converging lens of focal length 
(see Fig. 23–60). (a) Draw a ray diagram and estimate the
location and the relative size of the final image. (b) Calcu-
late the position and relative size of the final image.

69. Sunlight is reflected off the Moon. How long does it take
that light to reach us from the Moon?
70. You hold a small flat mirror 0.50 m in front of you 
and can see your reflection
twice in that mirror because
there is a full-length mirror
1.0 m behind you (Fig. 23–61).
Determine the distance of
each image from you.
General Problems
73. A pulse of light takes 2.63 ns (see Table 1–4) to travel
0.500 m in a certain material. Determine the material’s
index of refraction, and identify this material.
74. When an object is placed 60.0 cm from a certain converging
lens, it forms a real image. When the object is mo
