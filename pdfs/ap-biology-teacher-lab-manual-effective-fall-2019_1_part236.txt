e two randomly 
selected gametes. In spreadsheet vernacular, you want to concatenate the values in the 
two cells. In cell G5 enter the function =CONCATENATE(E5,F5), and then copy this 
formula down as far down as you have gametes, as in Figure 5 on the next page.

The next columns on the sheet, H, I, and J, are used for bookkeeping — that is, 
keeping track of the numbers of each zygote’s genotype. They are rather complex 
functions that use IF functions to help us count the different genotypes of the zygotes. 
The function in cell H5 is =IF(G5=“
AA”
,1,0), which basically means that if the value 
in cell G5 is AA, then put a 1 in this cell; if not, then put a 0. 
Enter the following very similar function in cell J5: =IF(G5=“BB”
,1,0) 
• Can you interpret this formula? 
• What does it say in English? 
Your spreadsheet now should resemble Figure 6.

Now let’s tackle the nested IF function. This is
