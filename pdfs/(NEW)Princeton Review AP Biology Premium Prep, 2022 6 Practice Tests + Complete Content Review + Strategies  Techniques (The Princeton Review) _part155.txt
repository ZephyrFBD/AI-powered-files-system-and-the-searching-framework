bose are also monosaccharides.
Both glucose and fructose are six-carbon sugars with the chemical formula C6H12O6. Glucose, the most abundant
monosaccharide, is the most popular sugar around. Glucose is an important part of the food we eat, and it is the
favorite food made by plants during photosynthesis. Living organisms break down glucose in order to provide cells
with energy. Almost all living organisms can perform this ancient biochemical process (which is called cell
respiration; you’ll learn more about this process in Chapter 6). In fact, the evolution of glycolysis, photosynthesis,
and oxidative metabolism is thought to have occurred about 3 billion years ago! Fructose, the other monosaccharide
you need to know for the test, is a common sugar in fruits.
Glucose and fructose can be depicted as either “straight” or “rings.” Both of them are pretty easy to spot; just look
for the carbon molecules with a lot of OHs and Hs attached to them.
Here are the two different forms.
