Investigation 6: Cellular Respiration
This investigation provides a method for measuring the rate of cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is the
breakdown of glucose with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy, as follows:
C6H12O6 + O2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + energy
In this lab, respiratory rate is measured in seeds or other organisms by observing the changes in the volume of gas
surrounding the organisms at various times. The rate of respiration can be determined by measuring the
rate at which O2is consumed or the rate at which CO2is generated. In this investigation, O2consumption is
measured, but since the volume of gas can be affected by both the consumption of O2and the production of CO2, the
CO2is removed by using potassium hydroxide (KOH). KOH reacts with CO2 gas to produce solid K2CO3, as
follows:
2 KOH + CO2 → K2CO3 + H2O
 
Since CO2gas is removed by its reaction with KOH, volume changes can
