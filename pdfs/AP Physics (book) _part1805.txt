electric charge.
11. When a charged ruler attracts small pieces of paper,
sometimes a piece jumps quickly away after touching the
ruler. Explain.
18. Why can electric field lines never cross?
19. Show, using the three rules for field lines given in
Section 16–8, that the electric field lines starting or 
ending on a single point charge must be symmetrically
spaced around the charge.
20. Given two point charges, Q and 2Q, a distance apart, is
there a point along the straight line that passes through them
where
when their signs are (a) opposite, (b) the
same? If yes, state roughly where this point will be.
21. Consider a small positive test charge located on an electric
field line at some point, such as point P in Fig. 16–32a. Is
the direction of the velocity and/or acceleration of the 
test charge along this line? Discuss.
*22. A point charge is surrounded by a spherical gaussian 
surface of radius r. If the sphere is replaced by a cube of
side r, will 
be larger, smaller, or the same?
