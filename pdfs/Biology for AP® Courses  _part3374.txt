the hormone thyroxine, which is also known as T4 because it contains four atoms of iodine,
and triiodothyronine, also known as T3 because it contains three atoms of iodine. Follicle cells are stimulated to release
stored T3 and T4 by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the anterior pituitary. These thyroid hormones
increase the rates of mitochondrial ATP production.
A third hormone, calcitonin, is produced by parafollicular cells of the thyroid either releasing hormones or inhibiting
hormones. Calcitonin release is not controlled by TSH, but instead is released when calcium ion concentrations in the blood
rise. Calcitonin functions to help regulate calcium concentrations in body fluids. It acts in the bones to inhibit osteoclast
activity and in the kidneys to stimulate excretion of calcium. The combination of these two events lowers body fluid levels
of calcium.
Parathyroid Glands
Most people have four parathyroid glands; however, the number can vary from two to six
