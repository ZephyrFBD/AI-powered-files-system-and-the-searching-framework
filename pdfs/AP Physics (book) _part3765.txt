 have been contact and thermal equilibrium to produce the observed nearly
uniform CMB. Inflation, by making the very early universe extremely small,
assures that all parts of that region which is today’s observable universe could
have been in thermal equilibrium. And after inflation the universe could be large
enough to give us today’s observable universe.
Galaxy Seeds, Fluctuations, Magnetic Monopoles
Inflation also gives us a clue as to how the present structure of the universe
(galaxies and clusters of galaxies) came about. We saw earlier that, according to
the uncertainty principle, energy might be not conserved by an amount 
for a
time 
Forces, whether electromagnetic or other types, can undergo such
tiny quantum fluctuations according to quantum theory, but they are so tiny they
are not detectable unless magnified in some way. That is what inflation might have 
done: it could have magnified those fluctuations perhaps 
times in size, which
would give us the density irregularities
