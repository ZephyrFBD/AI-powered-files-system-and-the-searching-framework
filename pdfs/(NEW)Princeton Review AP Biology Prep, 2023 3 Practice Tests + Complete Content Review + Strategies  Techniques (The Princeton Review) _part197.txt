Make sure you learn these differences, as the AP Biology Exam almost always
has a question about cellular structures.
Transport: Traffic Across Membranes
We’ve talked about the structure of cell membranes; now let’s discuss how molecules and fluids pass through the
plasma membrane, which separates the internal environment of the cell from the external environment. What are
some of the patterns of membrane transport? The ability of molecules to move across the cell membrane depends on
two things: (1) the semipermeability of the plasma membrane and (2) the size and charge of particles that want to get
through. In plant cells, cell walls provide a structural permeability barrier made of complex carbohydrates.
Since the plasma membrane is composed primaril
