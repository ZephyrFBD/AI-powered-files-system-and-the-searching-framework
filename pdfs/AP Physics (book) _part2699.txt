24–10 Polarization
An important and useful property of light is that it can be polarized. To see what
this means, let us examine waves traveling on a rope. A rope can oscillate in a
vertical plane, Fig. 24–38a, or in a horizontal plane, Fig. 24–38b. In either case,
the wave is said to be linearly polarized or plane-polarized—the oscillations are
in a plane.
If we now place an obstacle containing a vertical slit in the path of the wave,
Fig. 24–39, a vertically polarized wave passes through the vertical slit, but a
horizontally polarized wave will not. If a horizontal slit were used, the vertically
polarized wave would be stopped. If both types of slit were used, both types of wave
would be stopped by one slit or the other. Note that polarization can exis
