ter than a critical value known as the critical density, estimated to be about
(i.e., a few 
on average throughout the universe), space-time would
have a positive curvature and gravity would prevent expansion from continuing
forever. Eventually (if 
) gravity would pull the universe back into a big
crunch. If instead the actual density was equal to the critical density,
the
universe would be flat and open, just barely expanding forever. If the actual
density was less than the critical density,
the universe would have nega-
tive curvature and would easily expand forever. See Fig. 33–31. Today we believe
the universe is very close to flat. But recent evidence suggests the universe is
expanding at an accelerating rate, as discussed below.
