22°C. Cal-
culate the rate at which entropy increases in this process.
45. (II) A 2.8-kg piece of aluminum at 28.5°C is placed in 1.0 kg
of water in a Styrofoam container at room temperature
(20.0°C). Estimate the net change in entropy of the system.
46. (II) A falling rock has kinetic energy KE just before striking
the ground and coming to rest. What is the total change in
entropy of rock plus environment as a result of this collision?
47. (II) 1.0 kg of water at 35°C is mixed with 1.0 kg of water at
45°C in a well-insulated container. Estimate the net change
in entropy of the system.
48. (III) A real heat engine working between heat reservoirs at
970 K and 650 K produces 550 J of work per cycle for a heat
input of 2500 J. (a) Compare the efficiency of this real engine
to that of an ideal (Carnot) engine. (b) Calculate the total
entropy change of the universe per cycle of the real engine,
and (c) also if the engine is ideal (Carnot).
