EXCLUSIONSTATEMENT—The role of the 
Golgi in the synthesis of specific phospholipids and 
the packaging of specific enzymes for lysosomes, 
peroxisomes, and secretory vesicles are beyond the 
scope of the course and the AP Exam.
SYI-1.D.5
Mitochondria have a double membrane. 
The outer membrane is smooth, but the 
inner membrane is highly convoluted, forming 
folds.
SYI-1.D.6
Lysosomes are membrane-enclosed sacs that 
contain hydrolytic enzymes. 
SYI-1.D.7
A vacuole is a membrane-bound sac that plays 
many and differing roles. In plants, a specialized 
large vacuole serves multiple functions.
SYI-1.D.8
Chloroplasts are specialized organe
