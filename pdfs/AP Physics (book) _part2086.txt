The loop rule for the lower loop, including the weak battery and the starter, gives

The junction rule at point B gives
(iii)
We have three equations in three unknowns. From Eq. (iii),
and we substitute this into Eq. (i):
Combining this last equation with Eq. (ii) gives

NOTE The circuit in Fig. 19–15, without the starter motor, is how a battery 
can be charged. The stronger battery pushes charge back into the weaker battery.
