o 
a lower state, it emits a photon whose energy equals the
difference in energy between the two states; (4) the angular
momentum L of atomic electrons is quantized by the rule
where n is an integer called the quantum number.
The
state is the ground state, which in hydrogen has 
an energy 
Higher values of n correspond to
excited states, and their energies are
(27;15b)
where Ze is the charge on the nucleus. Atoms are excited to
these higher states by collisions with other atoms or electrons,
or by absorption of a photon of just the right frequency.
De Broglie’s hypothesis that electrons (and other matter)
have a wavelength 
gave an explanation for Bohr’s
quantized orbits by bringing in the wave–particle duality: the
orbits correspond to circular standing waves in which the cir-
cumference of the orbit equals a whole number of wavelengths.
