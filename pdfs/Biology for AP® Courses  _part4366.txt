vels off when the carrying capacity of the environment is reached, resulting in an
S-shaped curve.
Logistic Growth
Exponential growth is possible only when infinite natural resources are available; this is not the case in the real world.
Charles Darwin recognized this fact in his description of the “struggle for existence,” which states that individuals will
compete (with members of their own or other species) for limited resources. The successful ones will survive to pass on
their own characteristics and traits (which we know now are transferred by genes) to the next generation at a greater rate
(natural selection). To model the reality of limited resources, population ecologists developed the logistic growth model.
Carrying Capacity and the Logistic Model
In the real world, with its limited resources, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. Exponential growth may occur
in environments where there are few individuals and plentiful resources, but when the number of individuals
