 the assumptions you need to make in your calculation.
 10.67 A piece of dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) with a mass of 5.50 g 
is placed in a 10.0-L vessel that already contains air at 
 
705 torr and 24 °C. After the carbon dioxide has totally 
sublimed, what is the partial pressure of the resultant CO2 
gas, and the total pressure in the container at 24 °C?
 10.68  A sample of 5.00 mL of diethylether 1C2H5OC2H5, 
density = 0.7134 g>mL2 is introduced into a 6.00-L vessel 
that already contains a mixture of N2 and O2, whose partial 
pressures are P
N2 = 0.751 atm and P
O2 = 0.208 atm. The tem-
perature is held at 35.0 °C, and the diethylether totally evap-
orates. (a) Calculate the partial pressure of the diethylether. 
(b) Calculate the total pressure in the container.
 
10.69 A rigid vessel containing a 3:1 mol ratio of carbon dioxide and 
water vapor is held at 200 °C where it has a total pressure of 
2.00 atm. If the vessel is cooled to 10 °C so that all of the water 
vapor condens
