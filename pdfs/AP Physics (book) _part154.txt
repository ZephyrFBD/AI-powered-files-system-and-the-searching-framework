sarily negative. The
velocity of an object moving to the right along the positive x axis is positive;
if the object is slowing down (as in Fig. 2–11), the acceleration is negative. But
the same car moving to the left (decreasing x), and slowing down, has positive
acceleration that points to the right, as shown in Fig. 2–12. We have a decelera-
tion whenever the magnitude of the velocity is decreasing; thus the velocity
and acceleration point in opposite directions when there is deceleration.
EXERCISE C A car moves along the x axis. What is the sign of the car’s acceleration if
it is moving in the positive x direction with (a) increasing speed or (b) decreasing
speed? What is the sign of the acceleration if the car moves in the negative x direction
with (c) increasing speed or (d) decreasing speed?
2–5 Motion at Constant Acceleration
We now examine motion in a straight line when the magnitude of the acceleration
is constant. In this case, the instantaneous and average accelerations are
