y of H2O molecules. The hydrogen and 
 
oxygen atoms are bonded to one another through covalent bonds, 
in which molecules are formed by the sharing of electrons between 
 
atoms. The spoon consists mainly of iron metal, in which Fe atoms are 
 
connected to one another by metallic bonds, which are formed by 
electrons that are relatively free to move from one atom to another. 
These different substances—NaCl, H2O, and Fe metal—behave as 
they do because of the ways in which their constituent atoms are con-
nected to one another. For example, NaCl readily dissolves in water, but 
 
Fe metal does not.
What determines the type of bonding in any substance? How do the 
characteristics of these bonds give rise to different physical and chemical 
properties? The keys to answering the first question are found in the elec-
tronic structure of the atoms involved, as discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. In 
this chapter and the next, we examine the relationship between the elec-
tronic structure of at
