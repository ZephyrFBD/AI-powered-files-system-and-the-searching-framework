olutes, we can predict 
whether they are ionic or molecular. For those that are molecular, 
we can predict whether they are polar or nonpolar. We can then 
apply the idea that the nonpolar solvent will be better for the non-
polar solutes, whereas the polar solvent will be better for the ionic 
and polar solutes.
Solve C7H16 is a hydrocarbon, so it is molecular and nonpolar. 
Na2SO4, a compound containing a metal and nonmetals, is ionic. 
HCl, a diatomic molecule containing two nonmetals that differ in 
electronegativity, is polar. I2, a diatomic molecule with atoms of 
equal electronegativity, is nonpolar. We would therefore predict 
that C7H16 and I2 (the nonpolar solutes) would be more soluble in 
the nonpolar CCl4 than in polar H2O, whereas water would be the 
better solvent for Na2SO4 and HCl (the ionic and polar covalent 
solutes).
