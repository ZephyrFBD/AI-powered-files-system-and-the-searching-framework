Proper time 
is for 2 events at
the same point in space
¢t0
C A U T I O N
Proper time is shortest:
¢t 7 ¢t0
We need to clarify how to use Eq. 26–1,
and the meaning of 
and 
The equation is true only when 
represents the time interval between
the two events in a reference frame where an observer at rest sees the two events
occur at the same point in space (as in Fig. 26–6a where the two events are the
light flash b
