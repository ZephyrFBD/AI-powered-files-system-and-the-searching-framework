ion of all solutes 
present. Therefore, it is best to deal with moles first, and then 
convert to molarities using total solution volumes (volume of acid 
plus volume of base). (b) We proceed in the same way as in part (a) 
except we are now past the equivalence point and have more OH- 
in the solution than H+.
10.0500 L soln2a 0.100 mol H+
1 L soln
b = 5.00 * 10-3 mol H+
SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 17.7 
Calculations for a Strong Acid–Strong Base Titration
Likewise, the number of moles of OH- in 
49.0 mL of 0.100 M NaOH is:
10.0490 L soln2a 0.100 mol OH-
1 L soln
b = 4.90 * 10-3 mol OH-
Because we have not reached the equiva-
lence point, there are more moles of H+ pres-
ent than OH-. Therefore, OH- is the limiting 
reactant. Each mole of OH- reacts with 1 
mol of H+. Using the convention introduced 
in Sample Exercise 17.6, we have:
H+1aq2 + OH-1aq2 ¡  H2O1l2
