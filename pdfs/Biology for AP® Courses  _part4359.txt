 Population Growth
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are the characteristics of and differences between exponential and logistic growth patterns?
•
What are examples of exponential and logistic growth in natural populations?
Connection for AP® Courses
Population ecologists use mathematical methods to model population dynamics. These models can be used to describe
changes occurring in a population and to better predict future changes. Applying mathematics to these models (and being
able to manipulate the equations) is in scope for AP®. (Remember that for the AP® Exam you will have access to a formula
sheet with these equations.)
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activit
