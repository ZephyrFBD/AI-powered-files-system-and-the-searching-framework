mber 1.98 is very close to 2, however, and so 
we can confidently conclude that the empirical formula for the compound is HgCl2. The 
empirical formula is correct because its subscripts are the smallest integers that express 
the ratio of atoms present in the compound.
The general procedure for determining empirical formulas is outlined in Figure 3.13.

Give It Some Thought 
Could the empirical formula determined from chemical analysis be used to tell the 
difference between acetylene, C2H2, and benzene, C6H6?
 
Sample Exercise 3.13 
Calculating an Empirical Formula
Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) contains 40.92% C, 4.58% H, and 54.50% O by mass. What is the  
empirical formula of ascorbic acid?
SOLUTION
Analyze We are to determine the empirical formula of a compound 
from the mass percentages of its elements.
