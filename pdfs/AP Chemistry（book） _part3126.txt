 (a) Without using thermochemical data, predict whether 
∆G° for this reaction is more negative or less negative 
than ∆H°. (b) If you had only standard enthalpy data for 
this reaction, how would you estimate the value of ∆G° at 
298 K, using data from Appendix C on other substances.

 19.47  Predict which member of each of the following pairs has 
the greater standard entropy at 25°C: (a) Sc1s2 or Sc1g2, 
(b) NH31g2 or NH31aq2, (c) O21g2 or O31g2, (d) C(graph-
ite) or C(diamond). Use Appendix C to find the standard 
entropy of each substance.
 19.48  Predict which member of each of the following pairs has the 
greater standard entropy at 25°C: (a) C6H61l2 or C6H61g2, 
(b) CO1g2 or CO21g2, (c) 1 mol N2O41g2 or 2 mol NO21g2 
(d) HCl1g2 or HCl1aq2. Use Appendix C to find the stan-
dard entropy of each substance.
