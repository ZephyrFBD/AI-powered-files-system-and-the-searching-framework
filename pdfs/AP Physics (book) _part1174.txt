Fig. 11–15. Curve A represents an underdamped situation, in which the
system makes several oscillations before coming to rest; it corresponds to a more
heavily damped version of Fig.11–14. Curve C represents the overdamped situation,
when the damping is so large that there is no oscillation and the system takes a
long time to come to rest (equilibrium). Curve B represents critical damping: in
this case the displacement reaches zero in the shortest time. These terms all
derive from the use of practical damped systems such as door-closing mechanisms
and shock absorbers in a car (Fig.11–16), which are usually designed to give critical
damping. But as they wear out, underdamping occurs: the door of a room slams
and a car bounces up and down several times when it hits a bump.
In many systems, the oscillatory motion is what counts, as in clocks and 
musical instruments, and damping may need to be minimized. In other systems,
oscillations are the problem, such as a car’s springs, so a proper
