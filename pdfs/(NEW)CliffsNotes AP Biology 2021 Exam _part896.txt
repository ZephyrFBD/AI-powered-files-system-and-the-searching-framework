ial (Ψp), but for a solution in an open beaker,
 
the pressure potential equals zero.
 
Ψ(bag) = + Ψs + Ψp(bag) = Ψs(beaker) + 0 = Ψs(beaker)
 
Now the water potential of the sucrose solution in the beaker and the bag can be calculated using Ψs = −iCRT
(obtained from the equations
and formulas pages), where
i = 1 (ionization constant is 1 because sucrose does not ionize) C = 0.7, obtained from graph where the percent
weight change is zero R = 0.0831 liter-bar/mole °K (from equations and formulas pages) T = (273 + 25)°K (25°C
