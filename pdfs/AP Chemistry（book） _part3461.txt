 Arrhenius behavior of many 
chemical reactions (Section 14.5)?
 21.35  Some watch dials are coated with a phosphor, like ZnS, 
and a polymer in which some of the 1H atoms have been 
replaced by 3H atoms, tritium. The phosphor emits light 
when struck by the beta particle from the tritium decay, 
causing the dials to glow in the dark. The half-life of tritium 
is 12.3 yr. If the light given off is assumed to be directly pro-
portional to the amount of tritium, by how much will a 
dial be dimmed in a watch that is 50 yr old?
 21.36  It takes 4 h 39 min for a 2.00-mg sample of radium-230 to 
decay to 0.25 mg. What is the half-life of radium-230?
 21.37  Cobalt-60 is a strong gamma emitter that has a half-life 
of 5.26 yr. The cobalt-60 in a radiotherapy unit must be 
replaced when its radioactivity falls to 75% of the original 
sample. If an original sample was purchased in June 2016, 
when will it be necessary to replace the cobalt-60?
 21.38  How much time is required for a 6.25-mg sam
