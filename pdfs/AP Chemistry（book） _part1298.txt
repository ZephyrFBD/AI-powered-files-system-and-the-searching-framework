8.7 ∣ Exceptions to the Octet Rule
The octet rule is so simple and useful in introducing the basic concepts of bonding that 
you might assume it is always obeyed. In Section 8.2, however, we noted its limitation 
in dealing with ionic compounds of the transition metals. The rule also fails in many 
situations involving covalent bonding. These exceptions to the octet rule are of three 
main types:
1. Molecules and polyatomic ions containing an odd number of electrons
2. Molecules and polyatomic ions in which an atom has fewer than an octet of valence 
electrons
3. Molecules and polyatomic ions in which an atom has more than an octet of valence 
electrons

Odd Number of Electrons
In the vast majority of molecules and polyatomic ions, the total number of valence elec-
trons is even, and complete pairing
