 current flows until the neon gas in the
tube is ionized by a sufficiently strong electric field. Once the
threshold voltage is exceeded, the lamp has negligible resis-
tance. The capacitor stores electrical energy, which can be
released to flash the lamp. Assume that 
and 
(a) Assum-
ing the circuit is hooked up to the emf at time
at what
time will the light first flash? (b) If the value of R is increased,
will the time you found in part (a) increase or decrease?
(c) The flashing of the lamp is very brief. Why? (d) Explain
what happens after the lamp
flashes for the first time.
