 is negatively regulated by auxin
transported to the cell, and that auxin is positively regulated and amplified.
Think About It
Chemotherapy drugs such as vincristine and colchicines disrupt mitosis by binding to tubulin (the subunit of
microtubules) and interfering with microtubule assembly and disassembly. What mitotic structure is targeted by these
drugs, and what effect would this have on cell division?
G0 Phase
Not all cells adhere to the classic cell cycle pattern in which a newly formed daughter cell immediately enters the
preparatory phases of interphase, closely followed by the mitotic phase. Cells in G0 phase are not actively preparing to
divide. The cell is in a quiescent (inactive) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle. Some cells enter G0 temporarily
until an external signal triggers the onset of G1. Other cells that never or rarely divide, such as mature cardiac muscle and
nerve cells, remain in G0 permanently.
