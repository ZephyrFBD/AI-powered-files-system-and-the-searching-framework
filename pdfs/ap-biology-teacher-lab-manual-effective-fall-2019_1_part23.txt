needs. New challenges arise as students 
ask their own questions and perform their own experiments. By their very nature, 
inquiry-based investigations take longer to conduct, and additional materials and 
classroom space may be required. No new major lab equipment purchases are needed 
to conduct any of the labs in this manual, however. Students can work in small groups 
and share resources. If students do not achieve results at first, they may troubleshoot 
their experimental design, perhaps repeating a procedure several times before obtaining 
meaningful data. If time is a concern, instead ask your students what problems/errors 
they encountered, how these problems/errors could be avoided, and how the experiment 
would be different if it were to be repeated. Meaningful data are the goal, but students 
must be able to articulate nonmeaningful data and explain their causes. This is true 
science at its best. When students have the opportunity to mimic the practices of
