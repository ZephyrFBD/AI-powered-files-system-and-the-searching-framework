ein that increases the
duration of interphase, that protein is subsequently inhibiting the
entry of that cell into mitosis, making (C) correct. All forms of signal
transduction, whether inhibitory or stimulatory, lead to the increased
production of an eﬀector protein, eliminating (B) and (D). (A) is
incorrect because it is a false statement. As stated in the stimulus, if an
a cell detects the presence of an α cell or α factor, it will halt entry into
mitosis. Therefore, the time spent in interphase will be increased, not
decreased.

Chapter 9
Enzymes
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
In this chapter, you will review how to:
9.1 Explain how enzymes and substrates interact
9.2 Explain how cofactors or coenzymes aﬀect enzyme function
9.3 Contrast competitive and noncompetitive inhibition
9.4 Explain how concentration aﬀects enzyme function
9.5 Investigate how enzyme reactivity is aﬀected by concentration
