ze, density, dispersion pattern, age structure, and sex ratio. Life tables are useful to calculate life expectancies of
individual population members. Survivorship curves show the number of individuals surviving at each age interval plotted
versus time.

36.2 Life Histories and Natural Selection
All species have evolved a pattern of living, called a life history strategy, in which they partition energy for growth,
maintenance, and reproduction. These patterns evolve through natural selection; they allow species to adapt to their
environment to obtain the resources they need to successfully reproduce. There is an inverse relationship between
fecundity and parental care. A species may reproduce early in life to ensure surviving to a reproductive age or reproduce
later in life to become larger and healthier and better able to give parental care. A species may reproduce once
(semelparity) or many times (iteroparity) in its life.
