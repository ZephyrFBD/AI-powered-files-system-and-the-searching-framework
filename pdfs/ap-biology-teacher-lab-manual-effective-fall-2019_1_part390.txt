 than 25 cents each, have adjustable 
volumes, and work quickly. In addition, their small size allows them to equilibrate their 
temperature rapidly in water baths. 
O2 
The microrespirometer is placed 
in a water bath to help maintain 
a constant temperature. 
CO2 combines with KOH to form a solid 
K2CO3. As a result, the CO2 is removed 
from the air in the microrespirometer. 
Cotton protects the organism at the bottom 
of the microrespirometer from corrosive KOH. 
CO2 
The air is a mixture 
of O2 and other gases.

The respirometers must be airtight. They are sensitive to environmental changes, 
including movement from one’s bumping the lab table. Once the respirometers have 
reached equilibrium, they should not be touched or moved, nor should anything else 
be added to or taken out of the water baths (including students’ hands!). Students 
should not try to simplify their investigations by leaving out the control respirometers 
containing
