ange many of the amino acids in the sequence (depending upon where in the sequence the frameshift begins)
and, thus, considerably affect the final sequence of the polypeptide. Answer choice D may have no effect at all
because a change in the third position of a codon will often code for the same amino acid. (This results from the
“wobble” of the third position of the tRNA anticodon.) Answer choice B will result in a missing amino acid, while
answer choice C will change one amino acid to a different amino acid. These changes may alter the effectiveness of
the polypeptide, but not as severely as changing many amino acids, as would occur in answer choice A. The
inherited disorder sickle-cell anemia is caused by the replacement of one amino acid by another in two chains of the
hemoglobin protein, severely reducing the effectiveness of hemoglobin in carrying oxygen. However, a frameshift in
the mRNA coding for hemoglobin would certainly make it entirely ineffective.
