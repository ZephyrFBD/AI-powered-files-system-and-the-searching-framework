cathode:
Analyze We have to look up E°
red for two half-reactions. We then 
use these values first to determine the cathode and the anode and 
then to calculate the standard cell potential, E°
cell.
Plan The cathode will have the reduction with the more positive 
E°
red value, and the anode will have the less positive E°
red. To write 
the half-reaction at the anode, we reverse the half-reaction writ-
ten for the reduction, so that the half-reaction is written as an 
oxidation.

Determining Half-Reactions at Electrodes and Calculating Cell Potentials
The anode reaction, therefore, is the loss of electrons by Cd:
(b) The cell potential is given by the difference in the standard re-
duction potentials at the cathode and anode (Equation 20.8):
