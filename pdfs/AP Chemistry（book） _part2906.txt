eparate oceans we learn about in geogra-
phy books.
The world ocean is huge, having a volume of 1.35 * 109 km3 and containing 97.2% 
of all the water on Earth. Of the remaining 2.8%, 2.1% is in the form of ice caps and gla-
ciers. All the freshwater—in lakes, in rivers, and in the ground—amounts to only 0.6%. 
Most of the remaining 0.1% is in brackish (salty) water, such as that in the Great Salt Lake 
in Utah.
Seawater is often referred to as saline water. The salinity of seawater is the mass in 
grams of dry salts present in 1 kg of seawater. In the world ocean, salinity averages about 
35. To put it another way, seawater contains about 3.5% dissolved salts by mass. The list 
of elements present in seawater is very long. Most, however, are present only in very low 
concentrations. Table 18.5 lists the 11 ionic species most abundant in seawater.
Seawater temperature varies as a function of depth (Figure 18.17), as does salinity and 
density. Sunlight penetrates well only 200 m into th
