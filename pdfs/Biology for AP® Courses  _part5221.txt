e great majority of people who tested
positive had no symptoms because there was nothing wrong with
them. It was just a trick made possible by a test not testing for the
‘virus’.
Months aĞer my animated video the Gates-funded Professor Neil
Ferguson at the Gates-funded Imperial College conﬁrmed that I was
right. He didn’t say it in those terms, naturally, but he did say it.
Ferguson will enter the story shortly for his outrageously crazy
‘computer models’ that led to Britain, the United States and many
other countries following the Chinese and now Italian methods of
response. Put another way, following the Cult script. Ferguson said
that SAGE, the UK government’s scientiﬁc advisory group which has
controlled ‘Covid’ policy from the start, wanted to follow the
Chinese lockdown model (while they all continued to work and be
paid), but they wondered if they could possibly, in Ferguson’s
words, ‘get away with it in Europe’. ‘Get away with it’? Who the hell
do these moronic, arrogant people
