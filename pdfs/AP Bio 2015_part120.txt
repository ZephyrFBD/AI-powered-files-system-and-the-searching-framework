(c) Cancer can result from disruptions in cell cycle control. Mutations that increase the production of 
EGFR have been associated with skin cancer of the head and neck. Describe how a mutation 
outside of the coding region of a gene that encodes EGFR could lead to the overproduction of EGFR 
protein in a skin cell. 
Description (1 point) 
Mutation in regulatory sequence (promoter or enhancer) could increase rate of transcription 
of EGFR gene 
Mutation in transcription factor could increase production of mRNA, which would lead to 
production of more polypeptide 
Gene duplication may increase production of EGFR 
Gene translocation may inactivate repressor 
Mutation in repressor gene may remove controls on cell division 
Change in mRNA sequence may increase translation efficiency or mRNA stability 
(d) In cases of skin cancer that are associated with overproduction of EGFR, treatment with antibodies 
against the extracellular por
