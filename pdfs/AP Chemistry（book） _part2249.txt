Elementary reactions involving the collision of two reactant molecules are bimolecu-
lar. The reaction between NO and O3 is bimolecular. Elementary reactions involving the 
simultaneous collision of three molecules are termolecular. Termolecular reactions 
are far less probable than unimolecular or bimolecular processes and are extremely rare. 
The chance that four or more molecules will collide simultaneously with any regularity 
is even more remote; consequently, such collisions are never proposed as part of a reac-
tion mechanism. Thus, nearly all reaction mechanisms contain only unimolecular and 
bimolecular elementary reactions.
Give It Some Thought
What is the molecularity of the elementary reaction?
NO1g2 + Cl21g2 ¡ NOCl1g2 + Cl1g2 
Multistep Mechanisms
The net change represented by a balanced chemical equation often occurs by a multistep 
mechanism consisting of a sequence of elementary reactions. For example, below 225 °C, 
the reaction
 
NO21g2 + CO1g2 ¡ NO1g2 + CO21g2
