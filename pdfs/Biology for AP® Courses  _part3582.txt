the movement of gases across the membranes of alveoli is an important application of the principles of diffusion that we
explored in the chapter on passive transport. In addition, gas exchange provides the oxygen needed for aerobic cellular
respiration and for the removal of carbon dioxide produced as a metabolic waste product.
Gas movement into or out of the lungs is dependent on the pressure of the gas. Because the air we breathe is a mixture
of several gases, including N, O2 and CO2, the amount of each gas is measured by its partial pressure. As you remember
from our earlier exploration of diffusion, molecules move from an area of higher concentration to lower concentration, or,
in the case of gases, from higher partial pressure (measured in mmHg) to lower partial pressure. In other words, O2 and
CO2 move with their concentration gradients. Because both gases are small, nonpolar molecules, they freely travel across
the phospholipid bilayer of the plasma ce
