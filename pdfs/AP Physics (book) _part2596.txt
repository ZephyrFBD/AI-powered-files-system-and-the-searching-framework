Will it still be a con-
verging lens if placed in water? Explain, using a ray diagram.
28. (a) Does the focal length of a lens depend on the fluid in
which it is immersed? (b) What about the focal length of
a spherical mirror? Explain.
29. An underwater lens consists of a carefully shaped thin-
walled plastic container filled with air. What shape should
it have in order to be (a) converging, (b) diverging? Use ray
diagrams to support your answer.
30. The thicker a double convex lens is in the center as com-
pared to its edges, the shorter its focal length for a given
lens diameter. Explain.
*31. A non-symmetrical lens (say, planoconvex) forms an image
of a nearby object. Use the lensmaker’s equation to explain
if the image point changes when the lens is turned around.
*32. Example 23–16 shows how to use a converging lens to
measure the focal length of a diverging lens. (a) Why can’t
you measure the focal length of a diverging lens directly?
(b) It is said that for this to work, the con
