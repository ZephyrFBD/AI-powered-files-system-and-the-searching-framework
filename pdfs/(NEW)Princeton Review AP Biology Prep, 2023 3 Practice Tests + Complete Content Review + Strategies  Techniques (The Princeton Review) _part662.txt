d cycle and the electron transport chain are related and how they are affected by
exercise. (2 points)
The citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) is an important part of cell respiration. The reduced electron carriers created
during the citric acid cycle bring their electrons to the electron transport chain, which is used to generate ATP. During
exercise the muscle cells will need more energy. The process of cell respiration will speed up. When muscle cells have
exhausted their stores of oxygen, then the electron transport chain will cease and fermentation will take over.
b. Construct a graph of the data indicating citric acid cycle activity. Be sure to use error bars. (4 points)
1 point—proper axes
1 point—proper labels/data organization
1 point—proper size of bars
1 point—graphing error bars
c. Identify which group did not show an increase in cardiolipin after exercise was done. Justify your choice with
data. (2 points)
The obese group did not show an increase after exercise. Although the n
