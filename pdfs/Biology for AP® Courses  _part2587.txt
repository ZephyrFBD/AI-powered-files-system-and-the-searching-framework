marine organisms account for approximately 50% of the
biotic exchanges.

A. Compare quantitatively the rates of carbon cycling as
methane between the biosphere and atmosphere.
Calculate the percentage of methane production that is
anthropocentric (due to human actions).
B. Assuming that the rates of carbon dioxide exchange
shown in the diagram are accurate, analyze these data to
identify a missing contribution to the carbon budget.
Recently, it was discovered that ruminants fed
nitrooxypropanoic acid reduced their methane release from
digestion by approximately 50% and increased the rate of
meat production by as much as 80% (E. Duin et al., Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci, 2016).
C. Since methane is a greenhouse gas, its release into the
atmosphere further increases global temperatures. It has
been claimed that a feed supplement program will reduce
the effects of climate change. Predict the consequences of
such a program and provide reasoning for your prediction.
