The Golgi apparatus will not be able to sort proteins properly.
The Plasma Membrane
Like prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells have a plasma membrane (Figure 4.9), a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins
that separates the internal contents of the cell from its surrounding environment. A phospholipid is a lipid molecule with
two fatty acid chains and a phosphate-containing group. The plasma membrane controls the passage of organic molecules,
ions, water, and oxygen into and out of the cell. Wastes (such as carbon dioxide and ammonia) also leave the cell by passing
through the plasma membrane.
Figure 4.9 The eukaryotic plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer with proteins and cholesterol embedded in it.
The plasma membranes of cells that specialize in absorption are folded into fingerlike projections called microvilli (singular
= microvillus); (Figure 4.10). Such cells are typically found lining the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients
from digested food. This is an excelle
