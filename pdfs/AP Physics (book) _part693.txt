Washing a car: momentum change and force. Water
leaves a hose at a rate of 
with a speed of 
and is aimed at the side
of a car, which stops it, Fig. 7–2. (That is, we ignore any splashing back.) What
is the force exerted by the water on the car?
APPROACH The water leaving the hose has mass and velocity, so it has a
momentum 
in the horizontal (x) direction, and we assume gravity doesn’t
pull the water down significantly. When the water hits the car, the water loses
this momentum
We use Newton’s second law in the momentum
form, Eq. 7–2, to find the force that the car exerts on the water to stop it.
By Newton’s third law, the force exerted by the water on the car is equal and
opposite. We have a continuing process: 1.5 kg of water leaves the hose in
each 1.0-s time interval. So let us write
where
