f nitric oxide 1NO2 with bromine 
1Br22:
 
2 NO1g2 + Br21g2 ยก 2 NOBr1g2 
[14.26]
The experimentally determined rate law for this reaction is second order in NO and first 
order in Br2:
 
Rate = k3NO423Br24 
[14.27]
We seek a reaction mechanism that is consistent with this rate law. One possibility is that 
the reaction occurs in a single termolecular step:
 
NO1g2 + NO1g2 + Br21g2 ยก 2 NOBr1g2 Rate = k3NO423Br24 
[14.28]
As noted in Practice Exercise 2 of Exercise 14.13, this does not seem likely because termo-
lecular processes are so rare.
SOLUTION
Analyze Given a multistep mechanism with the relative speeds of 
the steps, we are asked to write the overall reaction and the rate 
law for that overall reaction.
Plan (a) Find the overall reaction by adding the elementary steps 
and eliminating the intermediates. (b) The rate law for the overall 
reaction will be that of the slow, rate-determining step.
Solve
(a) Adding the two elementary reactions gives
2 N2O1g2 + O1g2 ยก 2 N21g2 + O21g2
