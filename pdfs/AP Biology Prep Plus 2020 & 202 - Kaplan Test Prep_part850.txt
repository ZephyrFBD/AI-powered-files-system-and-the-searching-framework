always remain at or below the reference values. This suggests that
vertebrates can colonize wetlands easily, but that it is not so easy for
plants and macroinvertebrates. (D) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect
because the macroinvertebrates actually have lower initial mean
response ratios than plants. (B) is incorrect because the animal
populations represented in Figure A do eventually reach stable levels.
(C) is incorrect because macroinvertebrate density did reach the
reference levels, even though it did drop oﬀ later.

The plots showed relatively stable or decreasing net biomass growth,
but three plots is probably not suﬀicient to make generalizations. (B) is
thus correct. (A) and (C) are incorrect because none of the locations
showed an increase in biomass growth. (D) is incorrect because there
was some change in the biomass growth rate in the three locations.
