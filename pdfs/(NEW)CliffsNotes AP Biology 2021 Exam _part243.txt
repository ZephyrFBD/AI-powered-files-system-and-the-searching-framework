condenses into chromosomes and the nuclear envelope and nucleolus disappear. As centrioles (or MTOCs, in plants)
migrate to opposite poles, microtubules develop between them to form the spindle apparatus. The microtubules
attach to the kinetochores in the centromeres of the chromosomes and pull on the chromosomes. At metaphase, the
microtubules have pulled the chromosomes so that they are all lined up on the metaphase plate. In anaphase, the
sister chromatids of each chromosome are separated and are pulled to opposite poles by the microtubules of the
spindle apparatus. In telophase, the chromatids are well segregated to opposite poles. Nuclear membranes appear
around each pole and chromosomes diffuse into chromatin. Cytokinesis, the dividing of the cytoplasm, begins
during telophase. The cell is divided by a cleavage furrow in animals or a cell plate in plants. If the mother cell
began with a diploid number of chromosomes, then the two nuclei that form at each pole will also both be
