ein would most likely be
embedded in the membrane, not on its surface, and because the
hydrophilic portion would not necessarily extend to the outside of the
cell but could also extend inside.

According to the graph, the energy of the products is higher than the
energy of the reactants, which means that energy is absorbed during
the reaction. Such a reaction is described as endergonic, making (C)
correct. (A) is incorrect because energy is absorbed, not released, in an
endergonic reaction. (B) and (D) are incorrect because the reaction is
not exergonic.

Panting works in an analogous fashion to sweating, with both
processes using the evaporation of water as a cooling mechanism.
Because water has a high heat of vaporization, a lot of energy is
absorbed (and removed from the reindeer) in the process of
converting liquid water to vapor. (B) is therefore correct. (A) is
incorrect because the surfaces of the nose and mouth are too sma
