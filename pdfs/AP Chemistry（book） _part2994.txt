In which direction is this process exothermic?
Spontaneous for T > 0 °C
Spontaneous for T < 0 °C
▲ Figure 19.2 Spontaneity can depend on temperature. At T 7 0 °C, ice melts spontaneously 
to liquid water. At T 6 0 °C, the reverse process, water freezing to ice, is spontaneous. At 
T = 0 °C the two states are in equilibrium.

We must not confuse the spontaneity of a process with speed. Just because a process is 
spontaneous does not necessarily mean that it will occur at an observable rate. A spon-
taneous process can be fast, as in the case of acid–base neutralization, or slow, as in the 
rusting of iron. Thermodynamics tells us the direction and extent of reaction but nothing 
about the rate.
It is also important to understand that nonspontaneous does not mean impossible. 
For example, although the decompositi
