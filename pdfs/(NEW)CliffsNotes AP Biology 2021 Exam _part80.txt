ospholipids are oriented,
proteins may span across the membrane with their hydrophobic regions embedded in the membrane and their
hydrophilic regions exposed to the aqueous solutions bordering the membrane. The mosaic nature of scattered
proteins within a flexible matrix of phospholipid molecules describes the fluid mosaic model of the cell membrane.
Variations in the fatty acid makeup of the phospholipids influence the fluidity of the membrane. Phospholipids with
saturated fatty acids pack more tightly, leading to a more rigid membrane. In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids, which
bend at their double-covalent bonds, limit packing, and result in a more flexible membrane. Additional features of
the plasma membrane follow:
1. The phospholipid membrane is selectively permeable. Only small,
 
uncharged, polar molecules (such as H2O) and hydrophobic molecules (nonpolar molecules like O2, CO2 and lipid-
soluble molecules such as
 
hydrocarbons) freely pass across the membrane. In contrast, l
