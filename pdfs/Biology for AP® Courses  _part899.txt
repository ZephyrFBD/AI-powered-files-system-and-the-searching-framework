iods, pond-dwelling animals can
increase the number of unsaturated fatty acids in
their cell membranes while some plants make
antifreeze proteins to prevent ice crystal
formation in their tissues.
b.
Bacteria lack introns while many eukaryotic
genes contain many of these intervening
sequences.
c.
Carnivores have more teeth that are specialized
for ripping food while herbivores have more
teeth specialized for grinding food.
d.
Plants generally use starch molecules for storage
while animals use glycogen and fats for storage.
52. Which of the following best describes how the citric
acid cycle relates to glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation,
and chemiosmosis?
a.
Glycolysis produces pyruvate, which is
converted to acetyl-CoA and enters the citric
acid cycle. This cycle produces NADH and
FADH2 , which donate electrons to the electron
transport chain to pump protons and produce
ATP through chemiosmosis. Production of
ATP using an electron transport chain and
chemiosmosis is called oxidative
