 and
making a better fitting active site for substrate binding, allowing for
product formation. (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because they
represent competitive inhibition, noncompetitive inhibition, and
uncompetitive inhibition, respectively.

According to the table, as lactose (substrate) concentration increases,
lactase (enzyme) activity (represented by molecule formation)
increases and then plateaus for each pH level. Since there is no further
increase in the number of molecules produced at lactose
concentrations greater than 0.4 g/mL, it can be concluded that lactase
becomes saturated as lactose concentration approaches 0.4 g/mL.
Thus, the correct answer is (D). (A) is incorrect because the optimum
pH occurs when lactase is most active (when the number of molecules
formed is the highest), which is pH 7. (B) is incorrect because
maximum lactase activity is reached at a higher lactose concentration
(around 0.4 g/mL). (C) is incorrect because lactase con
