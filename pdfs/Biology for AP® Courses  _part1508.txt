ile nature of the bones and heavy microbial contamination. In their study, the scientists
were able to sequence some four billion base pairs. The Neanderthal sequence was compared with that
of present-day humans from across the world. After comparing the sequences, the researchers found
that the Neanderthal genome had 2 to 3 percent greater similarity to people living outside Africa than
to people in Africa. While current theories have suggested that all present-day humans can be traced to
a small ancestral population in Africa, the data from the Neanderthal genome may contradict this view.
Green and his colleagues also discovered DNA segments among people in Europe and Asia that are
more similar to Neanderthal sequences than to other contemporary human sequences. Another interesting
observation was that Neanderthals are as closely related to people from Papua New Guinea as to those
from China or France. This is surprising because Neanderthal fossil remains have been located only
in Eu
