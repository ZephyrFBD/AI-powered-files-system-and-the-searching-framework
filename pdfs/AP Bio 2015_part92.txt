125. The effect of temperature on the respiration rate of heterotrophic bacteria in a shallow, slow-moving freshwater 
stream was investigated by performing the following experiment. The water temperature of the stream was 
monitored over a continuous 24-hour period (starting at time = 0 hours). The respiration rates of bacteria living 
in the streambed were determined at 6 hours and at 9 hours. The results are presented below. 
 (in ÂºC) in water temperature associated with the change 
in respiration rate shown in Figure 2 ? Give your answer to one decimal place.
