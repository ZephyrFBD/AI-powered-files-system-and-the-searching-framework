 and differences in electronegativity, do you expect the 
dipole moment of an individual H ¬ C bond to be larger or smaller than that of 
an H ¬ I bond?
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
What is the dipole moment for HF (bond length 0.917 Å), as-
suming that the bond is completely ionic?  
(a) 0.917 D (b) 1.91 D (c) 2.75 D (d) 4.39 D (e) 7.37 D
Because the experimental dipole moment is less 
than that calculated in part (a), the charges on the 
atoms are much less than a full electronic charge. 
We could have anticipated this because the H ¬Cl 
bond is polar covalent rather than ionic.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
The dipole moment of chlorine monofluoride, ClF(g), is 0.88 
D. The bond length of the molecule is 1.63 Å. (a) Which atom 
is expected to have the partial negative charge? (b) What is the 
charge on that atom in units of e?

Before leaving this section, let’s return to the LiF molecule in Figure 8.9. Under stan-
dard conditions, LiF exists as a
