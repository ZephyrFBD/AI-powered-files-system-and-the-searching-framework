ed by cell division in the lateral meristem. Figure 23.10 shows the areas of primary and secondary
growth in a plant. Herbaceous plants mostly undergo primary growth, with hardly any secondary growth or increase in
thickness. Secondary growth or “wood” is noticeable in woody plants; it occurs in some dicots, but occurs very rarely in
monocots.
Figure 23.10 In woody plants, primary growth is followed by secondary growth, which allows the plant stem to increase
in thickness or girth. Secondary vascular tissue is added as the plant grows, as well as a cork layer. The bark of a tree
extends from the vascular cambium to the epidermis.
Some plant parts, such as stems and roots, continue to grow throughout a plant’s life: a phenomenon called indeterminate
growth. Other plant parts, such as leaves and flowers, exhibit determinate growth, which ceases when a plant part reaches a
particular size.
Primary Growth
Most primary growth occurs at the apices, or tips, of stems and roots. Primary growth
