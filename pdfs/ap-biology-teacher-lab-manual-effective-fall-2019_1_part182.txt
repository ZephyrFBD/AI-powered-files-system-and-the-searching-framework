For instance, they could select for the amount of purple color in the plants. 
This would involve students designing a system that would “quantify” color and look into 
the possible function(s) of purple pigment. The Supplemental Resources section includes 
the descriptions of a number of very accessible investigations related to the work that 
students conduct in the first part of the lab. Encourage students to explore concepts such 
as phenotypic plasticity or herbivore responses to trichomes. Cabbage white butterfly 
(Pieris rapa) larvae make a good herbivore for such a study. 
A commonly asked question is Why do these plants produce these small hairs? It must 
take energy to produce the hairs. Is there an environment in the natural world where the 
hairs might serve as an advantage for those plants that express them? This is the start of a 
hypothesis that students can investigate. 
Students may have other questions to investigate as well. They should start with a 
question of thei
