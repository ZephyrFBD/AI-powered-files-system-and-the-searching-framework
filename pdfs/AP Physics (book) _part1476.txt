molecular mass of the molecules in gas A is twice that of the
molecules in gas B, the moleculesâ€™ root-mean-square speed is
(a) the same in both gases.
(d) twice as great in B.
(b) twice as great in A.
(e) 1.4 times greater in B.
(c) 1.4 times greater in A.

ment is valid?

oxygen molecules, on average.
(b) Both will be moving at the same speed.
(c) The oxygen molecules will, on average, be moving
more rapidly than the helium atoms.
(d) The kinetic energy of helium atoms will exceed that of
oxygen molecules.
(e) None of the above.
11. Which of the following is not true about an ideal gas?
(a) The average kinetic energy of the gas molecules
increases as the temperature increases.
(b) The volume of an ideal gas increases with temperature
if the pressure is held constant.
(c) The pressure of an ideal gas increases wit
