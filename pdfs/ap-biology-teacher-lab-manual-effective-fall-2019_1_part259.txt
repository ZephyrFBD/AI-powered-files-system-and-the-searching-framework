■ Designing and Conducting Independent Investigations 
Now that students have completed this investigation, they should feel more comfortable 
using BLAST. The next step is to have students find and BLAST their own genes of 
interest. They might investigate something they have heard the name of, or you could 
ask them to think about and explore an enzyme or protein they studied before (e.g., 
DNA polymerase). They could look online for additional information to inform their 
questions (e.g., Are there diseases where DNA polymerase does not function normally? 
Do viruses make DNA polymerase?) Another option is to ask students to identify a 
disease that they know is related to proteins, such as
