pends on the formula 
weight of the substance. The formula weights of 10BF3 and 
11BF3 are different because of the difference in the masses 
of the two isotopes (the isotope masses of 10B and 11B are 
10.01294 and 11.00931 amu, respectively). The denominators 
in Equation 3.10 would therefore be different for the two iso-
topes, whereas the numerators would remain the same.
Sample Integrative Exercise 
Putting Concepts Together
Boron, atomic number 5, occurs naturally as two isotopes, 10B and 11B, with natural abundances of 19.9% and 80.1%, respectively. 
(a) In what ways do the two isotopes differ from each other? Does the electronic configuration of 10B differ from that of 11B? (b) Draw 
the orbital diagram for an atom of 11B. Which electrons are the valence electrons? (c) Indicate three ways in which the 1s electrons in 
boron differ from its 2s electrons. (d) Elemental boron reacts with fluorine to form BF3, a gas. Write a balanced chemical equation for 
the reaction of solid boro
