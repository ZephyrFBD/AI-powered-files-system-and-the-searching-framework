dY = amount of change 
dt = change in time 
B = birth rate 
 
D = death rate 
N = population size 
K = carrying capacity
rmax = maximum per capita 
growth rate of population 
 ( Y ) 
Y = YP + YS
Y = 
P pressure potential
YS  = solute potential 
The water potential will be equal to the 
 
solute potential of a solution in an open 
container because the pressure potential 
 of 
 
the solution in an open container is zero. 
YS = -iCRT
i = ionization constant (1.0 for sucrose 
because sucrose does not ionize in 
water) 
C  = molar concentr
