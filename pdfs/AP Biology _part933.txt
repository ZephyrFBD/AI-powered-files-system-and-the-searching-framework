cancers where cells grow out of control. The molecule miR-215 is a
signaling protein that seems to be related to apoptosis in some cells.
Below are two graphs: A and B:
Graph A shows the relative expression of miR-215 in cancerous
breast tissue and adjacent noncancerous breast tissue. Graph B
shows the results of an experiment, demonstrating the relationship
between apoptotic cells and an miR-215 mimic and an miR-215
inhibitor.
Describe the data shown in Graph A, in terms of miR-215 and
the presence or absence of cancer. (1 point)
Describe the data shown in Graph B, in terms of miR-215 and
the percentage of apoptotic cells in the experiment. (1 point)
