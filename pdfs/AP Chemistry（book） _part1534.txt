cture of HF, all the other atomic 
orbitals on fluorine move over at the same energy into the 
molecular orbital energy-level diagram for HF. These are 
called “nonbonding orbitals.” Sketch the energy-level dia-
gram for HF using this information and calculate the bond 
order. (Nonbonding electrons do not contribute to bond 
order.) (e) Look at the Lewis structure for HF
. Where are the 
nonbonding electrons?

[9.111]  Carbon monoxide, CO, is isoelectronic to N2. (a) Draw a 
Lewis structure for CO that satisfies the octet rule. (b) As-
sume that the diagram in Figure 9.46 can be used to de-
scribe the MOs of CO. What is the predicted bond order for 
CO? Is this answer in accord with the Lewis structure you 
drew in part (a)? (c) Experimentally, it is found that the 
highest energy electrons in CO reside in a s@type MO. Is 
that observation consistent with Figure 9.46? If not, what 
modification needs to be made to the diagram? How
