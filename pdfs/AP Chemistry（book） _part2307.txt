(ii) [M] would increase with the same slope as t = 0 to 
 
15 min, until t = 45 min at which point the plot be-
comes horizontal again, or (iii) [M] decreases and reaches 
0 at t = 45 min. [Section 14.2]
 
14.5 The following diagrams represent mixtures of NO(g) and 
O21g2. These two substances react as follows:
2 NO1g2 + O21g2 ยก 2 NO21g2
 
 It has been determined experimentally that the rate is 
second order in NO and first order in O2. Based on this

14.6 A friend studies a first-order reaction and obtains the 
following three graphs for experiments done at two dif-
ferent temperatures. (a) Which two graphs represent 
experiments done at the same temperature? What ac-
counts for the difference in these two graphs? In what 
way are they the same? (b) Which two graphs represent 
experiments done with the same starting concentration 
but at different temperatures? Which graph probably 
represents the lower temperature? How do you know?
