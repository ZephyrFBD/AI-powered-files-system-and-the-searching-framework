hy this happens, we must 
consider the forces between the electrons and how these forces are 
 
affected by the shapes of the orbitals. We will, however, forgo this anal-
ysis until Chapter 7.
The important idea is this: In a many-electron atom, for a given value 
of n, the energy of an orbital increases with increasing value of l, as illus-
trated in Figure 6.25. For example, notice in Figure 6.25 that the n = 3 
orbitals increase in energy in the order 3s 6 3p 6 3d.  
Notice also that 
all orbitals of a given subshell (such as the five 3d orbitals) have the 
same energy, just as they do in the hydrogen atom. Orbitals with the 
same energy are said to be degenerate.
Figure 6.25 is a qualitative energy-level diagram; the exact  
energies 
of the orbitals and their spacings differ from one atom to another.
