et that will be
continuously washed with dissolved carbon dioxide and
nutrients. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) will be used to
illuminate the growth sheet. Photodiodes placed above and
below the sheet will be used to detect light transmitted
through and reflected from the algal mat. The intensity of
light can be varied, and the algae can be removed, filtered,
and dried. The amount of stored energy in the algal mats
can be determined by calorimetry.
A. Identify a useful definition of efficiency for this study
and justify your choice.
B. Frequencies of light emitted by the LEDs will not be
variables but must be specified for the construction of the
apparatus. Identify the frequencies of light that should be
used in the experiment and justify your choice.
C. Evaluate the claim that the experiment is based on the
assumption that there is an upper limit on the intensity of
light used to support growth of algae. Predict a possible
effect on algal growth if light with too great an intensity is
