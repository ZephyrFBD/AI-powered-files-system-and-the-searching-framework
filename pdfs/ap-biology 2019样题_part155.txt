w combinations of 
alleles in the zygote—
a. Rules of probability can be applied to 
analyze passage of single-gene traits from 
parent to offspring.
b. The pattern of inheritance (monohybrid, 
dihybrid, sex-linked, and genetically linked 
genes) can often be predicted from data, 
including pedigree, that give the parent 
genotype/phenotype and the offspring 
genotypes/phenotypes.
RELEVANT EQUATION
Laws of Probability—
If A and B are mutually exclusive, then:
P ( A or B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B )
If A and B are independent, then:
P (A and B) = P (A) times P (B)
