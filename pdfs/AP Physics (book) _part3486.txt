edium containing a culture of bacteria. After
1.0 h the cells are washed and a 70% efficient detector (counts 70% of emitted 
rays) records 720 counts per minute from the cells. What percentage of the
original 
was taken up by the cells?
APPROACH The half-life of 
is about 14 days (Appendix B), so we can ignore
any loss of activity over 1 hour. From the given activity, we find how many
rays
are emitted. We can compare 70% of this to the 
second detected.
SOLUTION The total number of decays per second originally was
The counter could be expected to count 70%
of this, or 410 per second. Since it counted 
per second, then
or 2.9% was incorporated into the cells.
Another type of measurement is the exposure or absorbed doseâ€”that is, the
effect the radiation has on the absorbing material. The earliest unit of dosage was
the roentgen (R), defined in terms of the amount of ionization produced by the
radiation (
ion pairs per gram of dry air at standard conditions).
Today, 1 R is defined as the
