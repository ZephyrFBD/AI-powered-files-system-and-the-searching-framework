(adenosine triphosphate) functions as the energy currency for cells. It
allows the cells to store energy and transfer it within the cells to provide energy for cellular processes such as growth,
movement and active transport. The ATP molecule consists of a ribose sugar and an adenine base with three phosphates
attached. In the hydrolysis of ATP, free energy is supplied when a phosphate group or two are detached, and either ADP
(adenosine diphosphate) or AMP (adenosine monophosphate) is produced. Energy derived from the metabolism of glucose
is used to convert ADP to ATP during cellular respiration. As we explore cellular respiration, we’ll learn that the two ways
ATP is regenerated by the cell are called substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation.
