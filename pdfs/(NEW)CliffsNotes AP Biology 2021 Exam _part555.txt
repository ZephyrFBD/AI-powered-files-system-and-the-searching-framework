and excess interstitial fluids enter the circulatory system when they diffuse into capillaries. However, not all
of the interstitial fluids enter the capillaries. Instead, some interstitial fluids and wastes are returned to the circulatory
system by way of the lymphatic system, a second network of capillaries and veins. The fluid in these lymphatic
veins, called lymph, moves slowly through lymphatic vessels by the contraction of adjacent muscles. Valves in the
lymphatic veins prevent backflow. Lymph returns to the blood circulatory system through two ducts located in the
shoulder region. In addition to returning fluids to the circulatory system, the lymphatic system functions as a filter.
Lymph nodes, enlarged bodies throughout the lymphatic system, act as cleaning filters and as immune response
centers that defend against infection.
Blood contains the following:
 
1. Red blood cells, or erythrocytes, transport oxygen (attached to
 
hemoglobin) and catalyze the conversion of CO2 and H2
