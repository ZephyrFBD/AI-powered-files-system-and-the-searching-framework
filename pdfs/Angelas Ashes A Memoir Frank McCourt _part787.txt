d Mr.McCaffrey says,Oh,Mother o’God,what’s going to become 
 
 of us all? Who did ye sell them to? 
 
 He demands the names and address of the customers who are in 
 
 danger of losing their immortal souls from reading articles on birth control. 
 
 He will go to their houses and rip out that filthy page but the shopkeepers 
 
 say, ’Tis Saturday night, McCaffrey, and getting dark and would 
 
 you ever take a good running jump for yourself. 
 
 On the way back to the office Eamon whispers to me in the back 
 
 of the van, I have twenty-one pages. How many do you have? I tell 
 
 him fourteen but I have over forty and I’m not telling him because 
 
 you never have to tell the truth to people who lie about your bad eyes. 
 
 Mr. McCaffrey tells us bring in the pages from the van.We scoop up 
 
 everything on the floor and he’s happy sitting at his desk at the other 
 
 end of the office ringing Dublin to tell them how he stormed through 
 
 shops like God’s avenger and saved Limerick fr
