■Do NOT be tempted by the “distractors.” Incorrect answer choices are called distractors. As you read each
question, cover the answer choices with a piece of paper or your hand. Before you reveal the answer choices,
think of the characteristics that a good answer to the question at hand will contain. Then, reveal the answer
choices and choose the answer that best fits the characteristics you know a good answer will have. It is often
easier to focus your brain on finding the best answer rather than trying to eliminate each of the distractors.
■DO pace yourself. You will have 90 minutes to answer 60 multiple-choice questions. If it is taking you more
than two minutes to answer a question, move on to the next question and go back to that question later. Just
make sure to skip the bubble in the answer sheet for each question you skip so that the following answers are
filled in in the correct bubbles.
■DO answer every question.
