sodium 23, and so on. It was sometimes more complicated. For example, from the various compounds
oxygen formed, its relative mass was judged to be 16; but this was inconsistent with the mass ratio in
water of oxygen to hydrogen, only 8 to 1. This was explained by assuming two H atoms combine with
one O atom to form a water molecule.

† Most materials expand when their temperature is raised, but not all. Water, for example, in the
range 0°C to 4°C contracts with an increase in temperature (see Section 13–4).
