Which of the following best explains why there are usually no more

The statement is not true; there can be unlimited trophic levels.
Energy is lost at each trophic level.
Below is a climograph that shows the mean temperature and
precipitation for the temperate forests in the United States for the
past 50 years.
Predict how the climograph would appear if carbon dioxide
levels continue to rise and the United States continues to become
warmer and dryer over the next 50 years.
