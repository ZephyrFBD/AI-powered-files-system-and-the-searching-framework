re of the Earth over the past 400,000 years (Figure 35.27a). The 0 °C
on this graph refers to the long-term average. Temperatures that are greater than 0 °C exceed Earth’s long-term average
temperature. Conversely, temperatures that are less than 0 °C are less than Earth’s average temperature. This figure shows
that there have been periodic cycles of increasing and decreasing temperature.
Before the late 1800s, the Earth has been as much as 9 °C cooler and about 3 °C warmer. Note that the graph in Figure
35.27b shows that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has also risen and fallen in periodic cycles; note the
relationship between carbon dioxide concentration and temperature. Figure 35.27b shows that carbon dioxide levels in the
atmosphere have historically cycled between 180 and 300 parts per million (ppm) by volume.
