the speed of 
the particles remains the same, would you expect the bend-
ing to increase, decrease, or stay the same? [Section 2.2]
 
2.2 The following diagram is a representation of 20 atoms of 
a fictitious element, which we will call nevadium (Nv). 
The red spheres are 293Nv, and the blue spheres are 295Nv.  
(a) Assuming that this sample is a statistically representa-
tive sample of the element, calculate the percent abundance 
of each element. (b) If the mass of 293Nv is 293.15 amu and 
that of 295Nv is 295.15 amu, what is the atomic weight of Nv?
