Sample Exercise 10.14 
Applying Graham’s Law
An unknown gas composed of homonuclear diatomic molecules effuses at a rate that is 0.355 times the rate at which O2 gas 
effuses at the same temperature. Calculate the molar mass of the unknown and identify it.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the rate of effusion of an unknown gas rela-
tive to that of O2 and asked to find the molar mass and identity of 
the unknown. Thus, we need to connect relative rates of effusion 
to relative molar masses.
Plan We use Equation 10.22 to determine the molar mass of the 
unknown gas. If we let rx and ℳx
