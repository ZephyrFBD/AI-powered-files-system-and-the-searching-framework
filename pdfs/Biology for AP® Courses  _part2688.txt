 allows plants to grow towards, or even away from, light.
The sensing of light in the environment is important to plants; it can be crucial for competition and survival. The response
of plants to light is mediated by different photoreceptors, which are comprised of a protein covalently bonded to a light-
absorbing pigment called a chromophore. Together, the two are called a chromoprotein.
The red/far-red and violet-blue regions of the visible light spectrum trigger structural development in plants. Sensory
photoreceptors absorb light in these particular regions of the visible light spectrum because of the quality of light available
in the daylight spectrum. In terrestrial habitats, light absorption by chlorophylls peaks in the blue and red regions of the
spectrum. As light filters through the canopy and the blue and red wavelengths are absorbed, the spectrum shifts to the far-
red end, shifting the plant community to those plants better adapted to respond to far-red light. Blue-light r
