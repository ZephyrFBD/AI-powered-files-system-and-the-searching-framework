• Free-electron theory of metals, Fermi gas, Fermi level. New Section 29–6.
• Semiconductor devices—new details on diodes, LEDs, OLEDs, solar cells,
compound semiconductors, diode lasers, MOSFET transistors, chips, 22-nm
technology (Sections 29–9, 10, 11).
• Cross section (Chapter 31).
• Length of an object is a script rather than normal l, which looks like 1 or
I (moment of inertia, current), as in F = I B. Capital L is for angular

6. New photographs taken by students and instructors (we asked).
7. Page layout: More than in previous editions, serious attention to how each
page is formatted. Important derivations and Examples are on facing pages:
no turning a page back in the middle of a derivation or Example. Throughout,
readers see, on two facing pages, an important sl
