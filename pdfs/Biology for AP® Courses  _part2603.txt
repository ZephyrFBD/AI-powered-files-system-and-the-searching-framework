Connection for AP® Courses
Much content described in this section is not within the scope of AP®. You are not required to memorize the different
types of tissues that comprise the plant stem. However, in the Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants module we
will explore in detail the roles vascular tissues (xylem and phloem), epidermal guard cells, stomata, and trichomes play in
transpiration, the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen and water vapor. Trichomes—hair-like structures on
the epidermal surface—also defend leaves against predation (see the Plant Sensory Systems and Reponses module).
Except for the concepts described in the AP® Connection, information presented in this module, and the examples
highlighted, does not align to the c
