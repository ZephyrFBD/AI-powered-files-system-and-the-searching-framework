 on the plasma membrane
(sarcolemma) of the muscle fiber, allowing an action potential to move to the endoplasmic reticulum where calcium ions
are stored. When Ca2+ is released in response to the change in voltage, it binds to actin, causing actin filaments to shift
position and revealing myosin binding sites for the cross-bridges. The muscle contracts until the nerve impulse stops and
Ca2+ returns to its storage sites. The enzyme acetylcholinesterase removes lingering acetylcholine from the synaptic cleft.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the AP速
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP速 exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
