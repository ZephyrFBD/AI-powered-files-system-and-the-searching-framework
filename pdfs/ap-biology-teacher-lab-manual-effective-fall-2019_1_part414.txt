tting Up Your Control 
Because a microrespirometer is sensitive to changes in gas volume, it is also sensitive 
to changes in temperature and air pressure. To compensate for any changes, you 
will use control microrespirometers. The control respirometer is set up just like the 
microrespirometer except that it contains nonliving matter (e.g., small glass beads or 
dry, baked seeds) instead of germinating seeds. 
Step 1 Add 0.5 mL of beads or baked seeds to the second microrespirometer you 
assembled. Reinsert the syringe plunger and push it to the 1.0 mL mark. This seals 
the chamber and creates a chamber that has the same volume as the experimental 
microrespirometer. 
Step 2 Place three to four washers around the barrel of the control. 
Step 3 Place the assembled control in the water bath next to the experimental 
microrespirometer. Adjust the level of the water bath so the capillary tube is sticking out 
of the water while the barrel of the control is completely submerged. In order
