 plastic (also called a thermoset) is shaped 
through irreversible chemical processes and, therefore, cannot be reshaped readily. Vul-
canized rubber and polyurethanes found in commercial products including insulating 
foams and mattresses are familiar examples of thermosetting plastics.
Another type of plastic is the elastomer, which is a material that exhibits rubbery 
or elastic behavior. When subjected to stretching or bending, an elastomer regains its 
original shape upon removal of the distorting force, if it has not been distorted beyond 
some elastic limit. Rubber is the most familiar example of an elastomer.
