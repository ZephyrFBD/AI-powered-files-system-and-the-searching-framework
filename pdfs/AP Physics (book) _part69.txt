example, may find physics useful
in understanding how prairie dogs and other animals can live underground without
suffocating. A physical therapist will be more effective if aware of the principles
of center of gravity and the action of forces within the human body. A know-
ledge of the operating principles of optical and electronic equipment is helpful in a
variety of fields. Life scientists and architects alike will be interested in the nature
of heat loss and gain in human beings and the resulting comfort or discomfort.
Architects may have to calculate the dimensions of the pipes in a heating system
or the forces involved in a given structure to determine if it will remain standing
(Fig. 1–4). They must know physics principles in order to make realistic designs
and to communicate effectively with engineering consultants and other specialists.
