any imaginary gaussian surface as a sphere of radius r
concentric with the shell, shown in Fig. 16–45 as the dashed circle 
Then, by symmetry, the electric field will have the same magnitude at all points
on this gaussian surface. Because 
is perpendicular to this surface, Gauss’s law
gives (with
in Eq. 16–9)
where 
is the surface area of our sphere (gaussian surface) of radius r. Thus
We see that the field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if
all the charge were concentrated at the center as a point charge.
