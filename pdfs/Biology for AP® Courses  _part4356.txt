 first to show that the physiological state of the male affected its
mating behavior in a way that clearly maximizes its use of limited reproductive resources.
Figure 36.8 Male fruit flies that had previously mated (sperm-depleted) picked larger, more fecund females more
often than those that had not mated (non-sperm-depleted). This change in behavior causes an increase in the
efficiency of a limited reproductive resource: sperm.
These studies demonstrate two ways in which the energy budget is a factor in reproduction. First, energy
expended on mating may reduce an animal’s lifespan, but by this time they have already reproduced, so
in the context of natural selection this early death is not of much evolutionary importance. Second, when
resources such as sperm (and the energy needed to replenish it) are low, an organism’s behavior can
change to give them the best chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. These changes in
behavior, so important to evolution, are studied i
