ored fish would have an advantage. In the current situation, the dark-colored and the light-colored have
an advantage. This would give the dark fish more advantage. Plus, the arrival of a bird that eats light-
colored fish would really make the dark fish have the advantage.

A
From 1958 to 2008, the graph shifted away from medium-orange and moved toward the extremes (light
and dark). Choice (A) would make fewer orange fish be eaten, which would promote more medium-
orange fish. Choices (B) and (C) would cause fewer light and dark fish to be eaten, respectively. This
would promote the light and dark fish. Choice (D) would cause the medium-orange fish to be eaten more
often and thus promote the light and dark extremes shown in 2008.

C
Transmembrane domains are in the hydrophobic space and must not be polar. Of the amino acids shown
above the question, glutamate is negatively charged and lysine and arginine are positively charged.
Isoleucine, (C), is the only non-charged choice.
