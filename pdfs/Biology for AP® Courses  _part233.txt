r substance
the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one
degree Celsius
when polar water molecules surround charged or polar molecules thus keeping them dissolved and
in solution
molecules that share a chemical formula but differ in the placement of their chemical bonds
hydrocarbon chain or ring containing an atom of another element in place of one of the
backbone carbons
tension at the surface of a body of liquid that prevents the molecules from separating; created by the
attractive cohesive forces between the molecules of the liquid
outermost shell of an atom
very weak interaction between molecules due to temporary charges attracting atoms that are
very close together
CHAPTER SUMMARY
2.1 Atoms, Isotopes, Ions, and Molecules: The Building Blocks
Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. It is made up of elements. All of the 98 elements that occur naturally
have unique qualities that allow them to combine in various ways to
