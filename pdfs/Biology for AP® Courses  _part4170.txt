as well as the result of cell signaling. Ecologists interested in the factors that influence the survival of an endangered species
might use mathematical models to predict how current conservation efforts affect endangered organisms. To produce a
sound set of management options, a conservation biologist needs to collect accurate data, including current population size,
factors affecting reproduction (like physiology and behavior), habitat requirements (such as plants and soils), and potential
human influences on the endangered population and its habitat (which might be derived through studies in sociology
and urban ecology). Within the discipline of ecology, researchers work at four specific levels, sometimes discretely and
sometimes with overlap: organism, population, community, and ecosystem (Figure 35.2).
