the stroma into the
 
lumen by a cytochrome in the electron transport chain (ETC) between PS II and PS I (1B).
 
2. A pH and electrical gradient across the thylakoid membrane is
created. As H+ accumulate inside the thylakoid, the pH decreases. Since some of these H+ come from outside the
thylakoids (from the stroma), the H+ concentration decreases in the stroma and its pH
increases. This creates a pH gradient consisting of differences in the
 
concentration of H+ across the thylakoid membrane from a stroma pH8to a thylakoid pH 5 (a factor of 1,000). Since
H+ ions are positively
 
charged, their accumulation on the inside of the thylakoid creates an electric gradient (or voltage) as well.
 
3. ATP synthase generates ATP. The pH and electrical gradient represent potential energy, like water behind a
dam. The channel
protein ATP synthase allows the H+ to flow through the thylakoid
 
membrane and out to the stroma. The energy generated by the passage
 
of the H+ (like the water through tur
