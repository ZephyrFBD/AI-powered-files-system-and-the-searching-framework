15. Assume there are 50,000 joules (J) of energy available in trophic level II in the figure. According to the 
conventional model of energy flow in ecosystems, which of the following statements correctly describes  
the flow of energy in the system? 
(A) Trophic level I generates a maximum of 50,000 J of energy. 
(B) Trophic level I has approximately 5,000 J of available energy. 
(C)
