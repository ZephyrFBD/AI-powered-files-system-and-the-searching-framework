ocedures. With the tools/skills and questions 
developed in Procedures, the students are expected (singly or in groups) to carry out 
their own research or to develop a mathematical model of the energetics of these model 
organisms in Designing and Conducting Your Investigation. 
Just as the students need to build their skills for this laboratory within a scaffold, 
you should consider that you may need to do the same. Thus, you may consider that 
you, too, are developing a skill set to help students to investigate their own questions. 
If you have never worked with these specific organisms, you might want to consider 
simplifying your first assignments. One suggestion is to limit the students to growing 
and maintaining these organisms through an entire life cycle while recording daily 
observations in a laboratory notebook. In this manner, you will learn valuable skills for 
managing the classroom environment for long-term work and will develop a familiarity 
with the organisms that
