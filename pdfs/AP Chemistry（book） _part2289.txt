nase. This enzyme is not present in humans 
or other animals; rather, it is found in bacteria that 
live in the root nodules of certain plants, such as 
the legumes clover and alfalfa.
Nitrogenase converts N2 into NH3, a pro-
cess that, in the absence of a catalyst, has a very 
large activation energy. This process is a reduc-
tion reaction in which the oxidation state of N is 
reduced from 0 in N2 to -3 in NH3. The mecha-
nism by which nitrogenase reduces N2 is not fully 
understood. Like many other enzymes, including 
catalase, the active site of nitrogenase contains 
transition-metal atoms; such enzymes are called 
metalloenzymes. Because transition metals can 
readily change oxidation state, metalloenzymes 
are especially useful for effecting transformations 
in which substrates are either oxidized or reduced.
It has been known for nearly 40 years that a 
portion of nitrogenase contains iron and molyb-
denum atoms. This portion, called the FeMo- 
cofactor, is thought to serve as th
