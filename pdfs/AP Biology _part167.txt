(C) Microtubules make up spindle fibers. The configuration is 9
triplets with no microtubules in the center. (Cilia and flagella consist
of a 9 + 2 configuration of microtubules.) (SYI-1)
(A) The image presented in choice A confirms the researchers’
hypothesis because, when a cell in the S phase is fused with one in
G1, the G1 nucleus immediately enters the S phase and DNA is
synthesized. This demonstrates that molecules present in the
cytoplasm during the S and M phases control the progression of
those phases of the cell cycle. Choice B shows the cell in the S
phase going backward into G1, which does not confirm the
researchers’ hypothesis. Choice C shows both cells changing into
the other’s phase, which does not make sense. Choice D shows no
change from the original sketch and thus does not confirm the
researchers’ hypothesis. (IST-1 & SP 2)
(C) The order of phases in the cell cycle are G1, S, G2, and M
(mitosis). Thus, a cell that is in G1 would move into S and then G2.
