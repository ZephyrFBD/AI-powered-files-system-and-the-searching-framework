tropy term -T∆S has the greater effect on the temperature de-
pendence of ∆G and, hence, on the spontaneity of the process. 
For example, a process for which ∆H 7 0 and ∆S 7 0, such as 
the melting of ice, can be nonspontaneous 1∆G 7 02 at low tem-
peratures and spontaneous 1∆G 7 02 at higher temperatures. Un-
der nonstandard conditions, ∆G is related to ∆G° and the value of 
the reaction quotient, Q: ∆G = ∆G° + RT ln Q. At equilibrium 
1∆G = 0, Q = K2, ∆G° = -RT ln K. Thus, the standard free-energy 
change is directly related to the equilibrium constant for the reac-
tion. This relationship expresses the temperature dependence of 
equilibrium constants.
