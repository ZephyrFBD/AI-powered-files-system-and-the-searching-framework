 years, what would
they take into consideration?
a.
Scientists can predict the change in earth’s
temperature only by analyzing previous and
current data such as dimensions and locations of
glaciers as well as the water levels in lakes,
rivers, and oceans.
b.
Scientists could predict rise in temperature by
analyzing previous and current data like
dimensions and locations of glaciers, water
levels in lakes, rivers and oceans and by
counting and examining number of annual rings
in trees.
c.
Scientists could predict rise in earth’s
temperature by measuring the greenhouse gases
present in the current atmosphere. Counting and
examining the number of annual rings in trees
would also point to the climactic changes over
the years.
d.
Scientists can predict the change in earth’s
atmosphere by counting and analyzing the
number of annual rings in trees. Also, analyzing
ice cores for over a year would predict the rise in
Earth’s temperature in the next one hundred
years.
