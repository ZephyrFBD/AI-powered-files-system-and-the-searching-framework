Equivalent capacitance. Determine the capacitance of
a single capacitor that will have the same effect as the combination shown in
Fig. 19–19a. Take
APPROACH First we find the equivalent capacitance of 
and 
in parallel,
and then consider that capacitance in series with 
SOLUTION Capacitors 
and 
are connected in parallel, so they are equiva-
lent to a single capacitor having capacitance
This 
is in series with 
Fig. 19–19b, so the equivalent capacitance of the
entire circuit,
is given by
Hence the equi
