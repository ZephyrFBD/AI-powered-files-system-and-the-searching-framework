o hydrogen atoms is not fixed or in small whole 
numbers. The composition can vary within a range, depending on reaction conditions. 
TiH2 can be produced, for example, but preparations usually yield TiH1.8. These nonstoi-
chiometric metallic hydrides are sometimes called interstitial hydrides. Because hydrogen 
atoms are small enough to fit between the sites occupied by the metal atoms, many metal 
hydrides behave like interstitial alloys. 
 (Section 12.3)
The molecular hydrides, formed by nonmetals and metalloids, are either gases 
or liquids under standard conditions. The simple molecular hydrides are listed in 
Figure 22.6, together with their standard free energies of formation, ∆G°
f .  
 (Sec-
tion 19.5) In each family, the thermal stability 1measured as ∆G°
f2 decreases as we move 
down the family. (Recall that the more stable a compound is with respect to its ele-
ments under standard conditions, the more negative ∆G°
f  is.)
