observed:
Each species produces more offspring than can survive.
These offspring compete with one another for the limited resources available to them.
Organisms in every population vary.
Evolutionary fitness is measured by reproductive success.
The fittest offspring, or those with the most favorable traits, are the most likely to survive and therefore produce
a second generation. These are the traits most likely to pass to subsequent generations.
Fitness varies based on biotic and abiotic factors; different genetic variations can be selected for in different
generations.
Lamarck and the Long Necks
Darwin was not the first to propose a theory explaining the variety of life on Earth. One of the most widely accepted
theories of evolution in Darwin’s day was that proposed by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck.
In the 18th century, Lamarck had proposed that acquired traits were inherited and passed on to offspring. For
example, in the case of Lamarck’s giraffes, Lamarck’s theory said
