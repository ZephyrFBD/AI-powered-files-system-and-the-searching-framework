(d) A student claims that the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis would stop if a plant was kept in
the dark for a long period of time. Use your knowledge about photosynthesis to support the student’s
claim.

(a) For each of the three pigments, identify the color of light that will be most absorbed by that pigment. Use
the graph to justify your answer.
(b) A mutation causes a plant to lose its ability to produce the pigments chlorophyll a and b. A student wants
to design an experiment to study the rate of photosynthesis in the plant with this mutation. Identify an
appropriate control for the experiment. Identify the
