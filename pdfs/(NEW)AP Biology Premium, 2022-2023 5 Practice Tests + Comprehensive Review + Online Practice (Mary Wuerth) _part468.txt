ive pressures that lead to evolution. Scientists Godfrey Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg
each developed equations that describe these stable populations. For a population to have stable allele frequencies,
five conditions must be met:
1. Large population size—A large population size reduces the chances of genetic drift occurring. In small
populations, a change in allele frequencies (caused by genetic drift) is much more likely.
2. Random mating—Random mating eliminates the possibility of changing allele frequencies caused by sexual
selection.
3. No gene flow—For allele frequencies to be stable, individuals must not be entering or leaving the population.
The introduction of new individuals, or the movement of individuals out of a population, could change the
allele frequencies.
4. No selection—All phenotypes in the population need to have equal reproductive success in order to keep
allele frequencies stable. If one phenotype has a survival advantage, the alleles in that phenotype will become
