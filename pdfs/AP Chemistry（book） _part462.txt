C6H12O61s2 + 6 O21g2 ยก 6 CO21g2 + 6 H2O1l2
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the mass of a reactant and must determine 
the mass of a product in the given reaction.
Plan We follow the general strategy outlined in Figure 3.16 :
(1)  
Convert grams of C6H12O6 to moles using the molar mass of 
C6H12O6.
(2)  
Convert moles of C6H12O6 to moles of H2O using the stoichio-
metric relationship 1 mol C6H12O6 ] 6 mol H2O.
(3)  
Convert moles of H2O to grams using the molar mass of H2O.
Solve
