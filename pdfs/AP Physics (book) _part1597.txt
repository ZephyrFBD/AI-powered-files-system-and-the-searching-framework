CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
Fossil-fuel electric generating plants produce “thermal pollution.” Part of the heat
produced by the burning fuel is not converted to electric energy. The reason for
this waste is
(a) the efficiency is higher if some heat is allowed to escape.
(b) engineering technology has not yet reached the point where 100% waste
heat recovery is possible.
(c) some waste heat must be produced: this is a fundamental property of nature
when converting heat to useful work.
(d) the plants rely on fossil fuels, not n
