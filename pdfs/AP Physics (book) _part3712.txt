 it can be tested. The amount a light beam would
be deflected from a straight-line path must be small even when passing a massive
object. (For example, light near the Earth’s surface after traveling 1 km is pre-
dicted to drop only about 
which is equal to the diameter of a small 
atom and not detectable.) The most massive object near us is the Sun, and it was
calculated that light from a distant star would be deflected by 
of arc (tiny
but detectable) as it passed by the edge of the Sun (Fig. 33–14). However, such
a measurement could be made only during a total eclipse of the Sun, so that the
Sun’s tremendous brightness would not obscure the starlight passing near its edge.

very near the Sun, whose gravity bends
the rays, the star will appear higher
than it actually is (follow the ray
backwards). [Not to scale.]
