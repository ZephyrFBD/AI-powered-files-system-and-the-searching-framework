 Does 
the acidity of each molecule increase or decrease as the 
electronegativity of the atom X increases? [Section 16.10]
 16.12  For each of these reactions, identify the acid and base 
among the reactants, and state if the acids and bases are 
Lewis, Arrhenius, and/or Brønsted–Lowry:
(a) PCl4
+ + Cl- ¡ PCl5 
(b) NH3 + BF3 ¡ H3NBF3
(c) [Al(H2O)6]3+ + H2O ¡ [Al(H2O)5OH]2+ + H3O+

tion? Which is the Brønsted–Lowry base?
(a) O2-1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ 
(b) CH3COOH1aq2 + HS-1aq2 ∆ 
(c) NO2
