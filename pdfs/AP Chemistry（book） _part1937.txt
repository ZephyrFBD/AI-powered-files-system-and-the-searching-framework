monomer isoprene. (b) Adding sulfur to rubber creates carbon–sulfur bonds and sulfur–atom links  
between chains.

degradation reactions. The sulfur changes rubber into a thermosetting polymer by 
cross-linking the polymer chains through reactions at some of the double bonds, as 
shown schematically in Figure 12.42(b). Cross-linking of about 5% of the double bonds 
creates a flexible, resilient rubber. When the rubber is stretched, the cross-links help pre-
vent the chains from slipping, so that the rubber retains its elasticity. Because heating 
was an important step in his process, Goodyear named it after Vulcan, the Roman god 
of fire.
Most polymers contain sp3-hybridized carbon atoms lacking delocalized p elec-
trons 
 (Section 9.6), so they are usually
