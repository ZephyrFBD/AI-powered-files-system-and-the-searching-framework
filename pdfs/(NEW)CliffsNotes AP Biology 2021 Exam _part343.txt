new viruses then infect other cells, and
the process repeats. There are variations of this theme, depending upon whether the nucleic acid of the virus is DNA
or RNA, double-stranded or singlestranded. Some important variations follow.
For most DNA viruses, the DNA is replicated to form new viral DNA and the DNA is transcribed to produce viral
proteins. The DNA and proteins are assembled into new viruses.
For some RNA viruses, the RNA serves as mRNA or as a template to make mRNA. The mRNA is translated to
make proteins, and these proteins are assembled with RNA to make new viruses.
2. In the lysogenic cycle, the viral DNA is temporarily incorporated into the DNA of the host cell. A virus in this
dormant state is called a provirus (or, if a bacteriophage, a prophage). The virus remains inactive until some
trigger, often an external environmental stimulus (such as radiation or certain chemicals), causes the virus to begin
the destructive lytic cycle.
Retroviruses are ssRNA viruses that us
