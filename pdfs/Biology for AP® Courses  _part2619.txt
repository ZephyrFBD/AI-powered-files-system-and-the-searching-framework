annual rings and their nature (such as their size and cell wall thickness) can reveal the age of the tree and the
prevailing climatic conditions during each season.
Figure 23.12 The rate of wood growth increases in summer and decreases in winter, producing a characteristic ring
for each year of growth. Seasonal changes in weather patterns can also affect the growth rateâ€”note how the rings
vary in thickness. (credit: Adrian Pingstone)
Stem Modifications
Some plant species have modified stems that are especially suited to a particular habitat and environment (Figure 23.13).
A rhizome is a modified stem that grows horizontally underground and has nodes and internodes. Vertical shoots may arise
from the buds on the rhizome of some plants, such as ginger and ferns. Corms are similar to rhizomes, except they are

more rounded and fleshy (such as in gladiolus). Corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter.
Stolons are stems
