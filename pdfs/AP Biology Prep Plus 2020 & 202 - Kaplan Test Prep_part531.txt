locked would not
decrease, but would stay at the ambient temperature.

A living cell is in a state of non-equilibrium in which its high degree of
structural organization (combining smaller components into larger
more ordered structures) is maintained by releasing energy obtained
from the environment as heat. The release of energy as heat increases
entropy, so the second law of thermodynamics is not violated. (C)
appropriately summarizes this. (A) is incorrect because part of the
external energy obtained is released as heat. (B) is incorrect because
combining smaller components into larger structures decreases
entropy and metabolic heat loss increases the entropy of the
surroundings. (D) is incorrect because a living cell is in a state of non-
equilibrium.

The energy available to the primary consumer (grasshopper) is 5,000.
The percentage of energy that is passed to the tertiary consumer (owl)
is 45/5000 Ã— 100%, which equals 0.
