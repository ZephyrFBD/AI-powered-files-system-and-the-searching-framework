le’s lungs at 0.0 °C and 1.00 atm, assuming the air 
behaves ideally.
 10.38  (a) If the pressure exerted by ozone, O3, in the stratosphere 
is 3.0 * 10-3 atm and the temperature is 250 K, how many 
ozone molecules are in a liter? (b) Carbon dioxide makes up ap-
proximately 0.04% of Earth’s atmosphere. If you collect a 2.0-L 
sample from the atmosphere at sea level (1.00 atm) on a warm 
day 127 °C2, how many CO2 molecules are in your sample?
 10.39  A scuba diver’s tank contains 0.29 kg of O2 compressed into a 
volume of 2.3 L. (a) Calculate the gas pressure inside the tank 
at 9 °C. (b) What volume would this oxygen occupy at 26 °C 
and 0.95 atm?
 10.40  An aerosol spray can with a volume of 250 mL contains 2.30 g 
of propane gas 1C3H82 as a propellant. (a) If the can is at 23 °C, 
what is the pressure in the can? (b) What volume would the 
propane occupy at STP? (c) The can’s label says that expo-
sure to temperatures above 130 °F may cause the can to burst.
