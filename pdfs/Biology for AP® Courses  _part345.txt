ifically in order to drive a specific action like
an assembly line.
b.
It consists of many biochemical machines that have the same function in order to drive a specific action like
an assembly line.
c.
It consists of many biochemical machines where each functions randomly in order to drive a specific action
like an assembly line.
d.
It consists of many biochemical machines that functions in order to drive a non-specific action like an
assembly line.
Activity
Using construction paper, markers, and scissors, construct a model of DNA with at least 8 nucleotides.
Then, use the model to distinguish between DNA and RNA and hypothesize how the DNA molecule is
replicated during cell division. (Keep your molecule to model the processes of transcription and translation
that you will explore in Chapter 15.)
Think About It
A mutation occurs, and cytosine is replaced with adenine. Explain how this affects how the changed strand
will base pair with its complimentary strand of DNA.
