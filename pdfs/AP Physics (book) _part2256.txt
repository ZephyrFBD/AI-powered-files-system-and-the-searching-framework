 Fig. 20–47, charged particles move in the vicinity of a
current-carrying wire. For each charged particle, the arrow
indicates the initial direction of motion of the particle, and
the 
or 
indicates the sign of the charge. For each of 
the particles, indicate the
direction of the magnetic
force due to the mag-
netic field produced by
the wire. Explain.

20. A horizontal current-carrying wire, free to move in Earth’s
gravitational field, is suspended directly above a parallel,
current-carrying wire. (a) In what direction is the current in
the lower wire? (b) Can the lower wire be held in stab
