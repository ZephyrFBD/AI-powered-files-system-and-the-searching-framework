at uses atmospheric oxygen. Oxygen continuously diffuses into plants; in animals, it enters the body through
the respiratory system. Electron transport is a series of redox reactions that resemble a relay race or bucket brigade in
that electrons are passed rapidly from one component to the next, to the endpoint of the chain where the electrons reduce
molecular oxygen, producing water. There are four complexes composed of proteins, labeled I through IV in Figure 7.11,
and the aggregation of these four complexes, together with associated mobile, accessory electron carriers, is called the
electron transport chain. The electron transport chain is present in multiple copies in the inner mitochondrial membrane of
eukaryotes and the plasma membrane of prokaryotes.
Figure 7.11 The electron transport chain is a series of electron transporters embedded in the inner mitochondrial
membrane that shuttles electrons from NADH and FADH2 to molecular oxygen. In the process, protons are pumped
from the
