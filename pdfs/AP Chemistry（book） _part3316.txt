b) How many coulombs of electrical charge are 
transferred from Pb to PbO2?
 20.74  During the discharge of an alkaline battery, 4.50 g of Zn 
is consumed at the anode of the battery. (a) What mass of 
MnO2 is reduced at the cathode during this discharge? (b) 
How many coulombs of electrical charge are transferred 
from Zn to MnO2?
 20.75  Heart pacemakers are often powered by lithium–silver 
chromate “button” batteries. The overall cell reaction is
2 Li1s2 + Ag2CrO41s2 ¡ Li2CrO41s2 + 2 Ag1s2
(a) Lithium metal is the reactant at one of the electrodes 
of the battery. Is it the anode or the cathode? (b) Choose 
the two half-reactions from Appendix E that most closely 
approximate the reactions that occur in the battery. What 
standard emf would be generated by a voltaic cell based on 
these half-reactions? (c) The battery generates an emf of 
+3.5 V. How close is this value to the one calculated in part 
(b)? (d) Calculate the emf that would be generated at body 
temperature, 37 °C. How
