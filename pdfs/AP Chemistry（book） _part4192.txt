lways only one reversible isothermal 
path between two states. Thus, ∆S has only one particular value 
regardless of the path taken between states. page 815 Because  
rusting is a spontaneous process, ∆Suniv must be positive. Therefore, 
the entropy of the surroundings must increase, and that increase 
must be larger than the entropy decrease of the system. page 817 
S = 0, based on Equation 19.5 and the fact that  ln  1 = 0.  
page 818 No. Argon atoms are not attached to other atoms, so 
they cannot undergo vibrational motion. page 825 ∆Ssurr always 
increases. For simplicity, assume that the process is isothermal. The 
due to the autoionization of water. The additional 3H+4 from the 
very dilute acid solution will make the solution acidic. page 688

Nitrate is the conjugate base of nitric acid, HNO3. The conjugate base 
of a strong acid does not act as a base, so NO3
  - ions will not affect the 
pH. Carbonate is the conjugate b
