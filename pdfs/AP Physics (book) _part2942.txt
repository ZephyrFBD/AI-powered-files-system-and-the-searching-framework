A basic result of the special theory of relativity is that the speed of an object
cannot equal or exceed the speed of light. That the speed of light is a natural
speed limit in the universe can be seen from any of Eqs. 26–1, 26–3, or 26–4. It is
perhaps easiest to see from Eq. 26–4. As an object is accelerated to greater and
greater speeds, its momentum becomes larger and larger. Indeed, if v were to
equal c, the denominator in this equation would be zero, and the momentum
would be infinite. To accelerate an object up to
would thus require infinite
energy, and so is not possible.

; Mass and Energy
If momentum needs to be modified to fit with relativity as we just saw in Eq. 26–4,
then we might expect that energy would also need to be rethought. Indeed, Einstein
not only developed a new formula for kinetic energy, but also found a new rela-
tion between mass and energy, and the startling idea that mass is a form of energy.
We start with the work-energy principle (Chapter 6), h
