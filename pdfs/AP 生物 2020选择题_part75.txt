ENE-1.J: Explain how cells 
capture energy from light 
and transfer it to biological 
molecules for storage and 
use.
Photosynthesis
(A) 
Incorrect. The source of protons for the proton gradient is not only 
water but also protons that were pumped, by components of the electron 
transport chain, from the stroma to the interior of the thylakoids.
(B) 
Correct. Electrons are released from water molecules and donated to 
photosystem II.
(C) 
Incorrect. Glucose is produced using carbon dioxide molecules from the 
atmosphere, not stored carbon.
(D) 
Incorrect. NADH serves at the terminal electron acceptor for the 
electron transport chain.
