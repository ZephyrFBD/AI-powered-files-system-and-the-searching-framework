When an enzyme binds its substrate, an enzyme-substrate complex is formed. This complex lowers the activation energy
of the reaction and promotes its rapid progression in one of many ways. On a basic level, enzymes promote chemical
reactions that involve more than one substrate by bringing the substrates together in an optimal orientation. The appropriate
region (atoms and bonds) of one molecule is juxtaposed to the appropriate region of the other molecule with which it must
react. Another way in which enzymes promote the reaction of their substrates is by creating an optimal environment within
the active site for the reaction to occur. Certain c
