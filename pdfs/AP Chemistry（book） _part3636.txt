 22.101  Manganese silicide has the empirical formula MnSi and 
melts at 1280 Â°C. It is insoluble in water but does dissolve 
in aqueous HF
. (a) What type of compound do you expect 
MnSi to be: metallic, molecular, covalent-network, or 
ionic? (b) Write a likely balanced chemical equation for the 
reaction of MnSi with concentrated aqueous HF
.
 22.102  Hydrazine has been employed as a reducing agent for met-
als. Using standard reduction potentials, predict whether 
the following metals can be reduced to the metallic state 
by hydrazine under standard conditions in acidic solution: 
 
(a) Fe2 +, (b) Sn2 +, (c) Cu2 +, (d) Ag+, (e) Cr3 +, (f) Co3 +.
 22.103  Both dimethylhydrazine, 1CH322NNH2, and methylhydra-
zine, CH3NHNH2, have been used as rocket fuels. When 
dinitrogen tetroxide 1N2O42 is used as the oxidizer, the 
products are H2O, CO2, and N2. If the thrust of the rocket 
depends on the volume of the products produced, which 
of the substituted hydrazines p
