†As we discussed in Section 5–9, physicists in the twentieth century came to recognize four different
fundamental forces in nature: (1) gravitational force, (2) electromagnetic force (we will see later that
electric and magnetic forces are intimately related), (3) strong nuclear force, and (4) weak nuclear
force. The last two forces operate at the level of the nucleus of an atom. Recent theory has combined
the electromagnetic and weak
