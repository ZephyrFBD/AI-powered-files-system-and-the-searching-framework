lying the volume of plasmid solution added by the mass
concentration of the plasmid: 10 μL × 0.005 μg/μL = 0.05 μg. The
question stem also states that 150 μL of a 600 μL suspension was
plated, so the total amount of plasmid that was spread on the plate is
equal to the plasmid mass multiplied by the fraction of the suspension
that was spread: 0.05 μg × (150 μL/600 μL) = 0.0125 μg of plasmid
plated.
Plugging in these values to the equation for transformation eﬀiciency
gives the following result: 35/0.0125 = 2800 colonies per microgram of
plasmid. (D) is correct.

Viral replication allows for mutations, such as those caused by
environmental factors like UV radiation from the Sun and those
resulting from mismatches between nitrogenous bases. However, the
unique method of replication used by RNA viruses does not include the
error-checking mechanisms that are present in DNA viruses, which can
undo the eﬀects of mutation. As a result, RNA viruses are observed to
