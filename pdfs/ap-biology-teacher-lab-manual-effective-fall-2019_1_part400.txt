 
investigation without much difficulty? If students had difficulty, ask them to teach 
each other how to use the equipment. 
7. Did students have an adequate understanding of the general gas law as it applies to 
the concepts in this lab? 
8. Released AP Exams have several multiple-choice and free-response (essay) questions 
based on the concepts studied in this investigation. These could be used to assess 
your students’ understanding. 
■ Where Can Students Go from Here? 
Students can explore answers to other questions that might have been raised as they 
conducted their experiment(s). For example, if they originally investigated the effect 
of temperature on metabolic rate in plant seeds, they might want to explore a different 
aspect, such as the effect of temperature on metabolic rate in small invertebrates, such as 
insects or earthworms, or the relationship between the mass of an organism and its rate 
of respiration.
