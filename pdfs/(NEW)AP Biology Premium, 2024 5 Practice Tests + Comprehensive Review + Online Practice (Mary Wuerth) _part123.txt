adient without the input of energy is also called diffusion. The diffusion of water down its concentration gradient
across a membrane gets a special name, osmosis. This will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 6.
Molecules that are polar or charged may require a membrane protein in order to diffuse across the cell
membrane. The process of passive transport that uses a membrane protein is called facilitated diffusion. One
example is the specialized membrane proteins called aquaporins that allow large quantities of water to move down
their concentration gradient. Specialized channel proteins can allow the passive transport of ions, such and Ca+2 or
Clâ€“1, down their concentration gradients. Because molecules that use facilitated diffusion require a membrane
protein in order to cross the membrane, the rate of facilitated diffusion is limited by the number of membrane
proteins available and is said to be saturable.
