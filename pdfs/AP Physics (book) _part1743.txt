vector sum of the forces due to each of the
others. This principle of superposition is based on experiment, and tells us that
electric force vectors add like any other vector. For example, if you have a system
of four charges, the net force on charge 1, say, is the sum of the forces exerted on
charge 1 by charges 2, 3, and 4. The magnitudes of these three forces are determined
from Coulomb’s law, and then are added vectorially.
16–6 Solving Problems Involving
Coulomb’s Law and Vectors
The electric force between charged particles at rest (sometimes referred to as the
electrostatic force or as the Coulomb force) is, like all forces, a vector: it has both
magnitude and direction. When several forces act on an object (call them 
etc.), the net force 
on the object is the vector sum of all the forces acting on it:
This is the principle of superposition for forces. We studied how to add vectors in
Chapter 3; then in Chapter 4 we used the rules for adding vectors to obtain the
net force on an
