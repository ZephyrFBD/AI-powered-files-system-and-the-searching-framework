Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (B) If the target cell lacks receptors for the signaling molecule, it will not be able to initiate the signal
transduction pathway that triggers cell division. Choice (A) is incorrect because the cells will not divide if they
lack the appropriate receptor for the ligand; the signaling pathway for cell division will not be triggered. Choice
(C) is incorrect because individual cells do not evolve new receptors. If the cell lacks the receptors for the
signaling molecule, the cell will not be able to respond to the signal, so choice (D) is incorrect.
2. (D) Cortisol would stimulate the breakdown of glycogen into glucose. This would provide energy, alleviating
one of the symptoms of hunger. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because the activation of the immune
response, increased storage of calcium in bones, and increased reabsorption of water by the kidneys would not
increase the energy available to cells
