Part III: Cancer and the Cell Cycle
The cell cycle is tightly controlled by checkpoints and other mechanisms that evaluate cell status to ensure that each
stage of the cell cycle is complete before advancing to the next stages. When DNA is damaged from replication
errors or from radiation, chemicals, or other environmental effects, the mechanisms that monitor cell cycle status
may fail. Cancer, characterized by uncontrolled cell division, may result.
This part of the investigation involves a discussion of two kinds of cancer: 1. HeLa cells. HeLa cells are cancer cells
taken from Henrietta Lacks, an African-American woman, who died of cervical cancer in 1951. Although normal
cells will divide only up to 50 times in culture, HeLa cells have been dividing continuously in culture in labs all over
the world since they were removed from Lacks. Even for cancer cells, the tenacity of HeLa cells is exceptional. As a
result, these “immortal” cells have been used for research and have contribute
