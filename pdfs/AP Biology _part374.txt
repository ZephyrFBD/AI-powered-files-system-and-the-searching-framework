accomplished. Here is essentially what they did. They set up two
phage cultures: one growing in radioactive sulfur (35S), and the other
growing in radioactive phosphorus (32P). The protocol is shown in
the following chart.
Using the description of this experiment and what you know about
DNA and proteins, which of the following statements correctly
describes what radioactive substance will be identified inside the
bacterial cells and provides the correct reasoning for that claim?
32P will be found in the bacteria cells because protein from the
T2 bacteriophage coat entered the bacteria.
32P will be found in the bacteria cells because DNA from the
T2 bacteriophage interior entered the bacteria.
35S will be found in the bacteria cells because protein from the
T2 bacteriophage coat entered the bacteria.
35S will be found in the bacteria cells because protein from the
