3.2 Explain why life requires free energy
The mnemonic device N’CHOPS (for nice chops!) can be used to
remember the main elements of life.
Most molecules that contain carbon (C) are known as organic molecules
or organic compounds. (There are some exceptions: for instance, carbon
dioxide and hydrogen cyanide have the chemical formulas CO2 and HCN,
respectively, but are generally not considered to be organic.) Life
wouldn’t exist without organic compounds. Carbon earned its place as a
staple in biology because it can bond to other atoms or to itself in four
diﬀerent equally spaced directions, allowing complex molecules of
almost unlimited size and shape to be formed. The structural properties
of the carbon atom have allowed for the formation of molecular
compounds—such as DNA and enzymes—that have unique chemical
identities and functions. The message to take home is that there are only
a few elements important to biology (N’CHOPS) and that carbon is the
main ele
