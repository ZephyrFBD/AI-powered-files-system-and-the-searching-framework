or step 1, and k2 
is the rate constant for step 2. A negative subscript refers to the rate constant for the reverse of an 
elementary step. For example, k - 1 is the rate constant for the reverse of the first step.
Sample Exercise 14.14
 Determining the Rate Law for a Multistep Mechanism
The decomposition of nitrous oxide, N2O, is believed to occur by a two-step mechanism:
N2O1g2 ¡ N21g2 + O1g2 1slow2
N2O1g2 + O1g2 ¡ N21g2 + O21g2 1fast2
(a) Write the equation for the overall reaction. (b) Write the rate law for the overall reaction.

Mechanisms with a Fast Initial Step
It is possible, but not particularly straightforward, to derive the rate law for a mechanism 
in which an intermediate is a reactant in the rate-determining step. This situation arises 
in multistep mechanisms when the first step is fast and therefore not the rate-determining 
step. Let’s consider one example: the gas-phase reaction o
