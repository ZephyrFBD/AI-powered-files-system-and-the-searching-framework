ately 1:2:1, respectively. We can represent the proportion of elements within
carbohydrate molecules by the formula CnH2nOn, which can be simplified as (CH2O)n.
Most carbohydrates are categorized as either monosaccharides, disaccharides, or polysaccharides. The term
saccharides is a fancy word for “sugar.” The prefixes mono-, di-, and poly- refer to the number of sugars in the
molecule. Mono- means “one,” di- means “two,” and poly- means “many.” A monosaccharide is therefore a
carbohydrate made up of a single saccharide.
Monosaccharides: The Simplest Sugars
Monosaccharides, the simplest sugars, serve as an energy source for cells. The two most common sugars are (1)
glucose and (2) fructose. Galactose, ribose, and deoxyribose are also monosaccharides.
Both glucose and fructose are six-carbon sugars with the chemical formula C6H12O6. Glucose, the most abundant
monosaccharide, is the most popular sugar around. Glucose is an important part of the food we eat, and it is the
favorite food ma
