icle’s path is revealed.
In a cloud chamber, used in the early days of nuclear physics, a gas is cooled
to a temperature slightly below its usual condensation point (“supercooled”).
Tiny droplets form around ions produced when a charged particle passes through
(Fig. 30–15). Light scattering from these droplets reveals the track of the particle.
The bubble chamber, invented in 1952 by Donald A. Glaser (1926–2013),
makes use of a superheated liquid kept close to its normal boiling point. Bubbles
characteristic of boiling form around ions produced by the passage of a charged
particle, revealing paths of particles that recently passed through. Because a
bubble chamber uses a liquid, often liquid hydrogen, many more interactions can
occur than in a cloud chamber. A magnetic field applied across the chamber
makes charged particle paths curve (Chapter 20) and allows the momentum of
charged particles to be determined from the radius of curvature of their paths.
