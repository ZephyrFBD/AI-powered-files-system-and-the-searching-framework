Avogadro’s Number and the Mole (Section 3.4)
 3.29 (a) Write “true” or “false” for each statement. (a) A mole of 
horses contain a mole of horse legs. (b) A mole of water has a 
mass of 18.0 g. (c) The mass of 1 molecule of water is 18.0 g. 
(d) A mole of NaCl(s) contains 2 moles of ions.
 3.30 (a) What is the mass, in grams, of one mole of 12C? (b) How 
many carbon atoms are present in one mole of 12C?
 3.31 Without doing any detailed calculations (but using a 
periodic table to give atomic weights), rank the follow-
ing samples in order of increasing numbers of atoms: 
0.50 mol H2O, 23 g Na, 6.0 * 1023 N2 molecules.
 3.32 Without doing any detailed calculations (but using a 
 
periodic table to give atomic weights), rank the follow-
ing samples in order of increasing numbers of atoms: 
42 g of NaHCO3, 1.5 mol CO2, 6.0 * 1024 Ne atoms.
 3.33 What is the mass, in kilograms, of an Avogadro’s number of 
people, if the average mass of a person is 160 lb? How does 
this compare with the
