t quite so
obvious as discovering gold or oil. Should the discovery of the electron be credited
to the person who first saw a glow in the tube? Or to the person who first called
them cathode rays? Perhaps neither one, for they had no conception of the electron
as we know it today. In fact, the credit for the discovery is generally given to
Thomson, but not because he was the first to see the glow in the tube. Rather it 
is because he believed that this phenomenon was due to tiny negatively charged
particles and made careful measurements on them. Furthermore he argued that
these particles were constituents of atoms, and not ions or atoms themselves as
many thought, and he developed an electron theory of matter. His view is close to
what we accept today, and this is why Thomson is credited with the “discovery.”
Note, however, that neither he nor anyone else ever actually saw an electron itself.
We discuss this briefly, for it illustrates the fact that discovery in science is not
always a
