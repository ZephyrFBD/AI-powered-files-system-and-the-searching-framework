 that they have studied previously, including the relationship between 
cell structure and function (chloroplast); enzymatic activity (especially rubisco, if 
temperature as a variable is explored); strategies for capture, storage, and use of free 
energy; diffusion of gases across cell membranes; behavior of gases in solution; evolution 
of plants and photosynthesis (including an explanation of why plants don’t absorb green 
light); and the physical laws pertaining to the properties of buoyancy. 
Note 
 About Light Sources: A strong light source is necessary for success in this 
procedure. Some of the best results have been obtained when placing the cups of leaf 
disks on the bed of an overhead projector. Another inexpensive light source is the “work 
spotlights” that you can purchase from various retail stores, coupled with 100-watt 
equivalent compact fluorescent bulbs.
