pe is an example of an animal that goes into a seasonal
estrus cycle (“heat”): a hormonally induced physiological condition preparing the body for successful mating (Figure
36.7b). Females of these species mate only during the estrus phase of the cycle. A different pattern is observed in primates,
including humans and chimpanzees, which may attempt reproduction at any time during their reproductive years, even
though their menstrual cycles make pregnancy likely only a few days per month during ovulation (Figure 36.7c).
