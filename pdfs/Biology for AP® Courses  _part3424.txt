sed from the pituitary gland
in response to a stimulus, travels through the
body, and then binds to a receptor of a target cell
to illicit response.
c.
A hormone is released in response to a stimulus,
travels through the body, and then binds to
receptors to stimulate the signaling pathway.
d.
A hormone is released in response to a stimulus,
travels through the body and then binds to the
intracellular receptors of target cells to illicit a
response.
54. Steroid hormones are known to circulate in the blood
longer than peptide hormones. Describe why this occurs.
a.
Peptide hormones cannot pass through cell
membranes.
b.
Steroid hormones are water insoluble.
c.
Peptide hormones are water insoluble.
d.
Steroid hormones cannot pass through cell
membranes.
55. Lipid-derived hormones, such as steroid hormones,
utilize intracellular receptors, whereas peptide and amino
acid-derived hormones utilize cell surface receptors.
Discuss why these hormones utilize different types of
receptors.
