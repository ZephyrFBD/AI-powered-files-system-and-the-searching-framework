4. Coat color in cats is controlled by multiple genes. For example,
cats can have a dominant autosomal allele called “agouti” for a
particular coat pattern or can have a recessive allele for a solid
coat color. Additionally, they can have a standard, full-color coat
or a dilute, pale coat depending on whether they have the
recessive dilute allele. A test cross was performed between an
agouti, full-color male and a female that was homozygous
recessive for both traits. Which of the following would be true
regarding the results of the cross?
If all of the oﬀspring had agouti, full-color coats, then the
male is probably homozygous dominant for both traits.
(A)
If all of the oﬀspring had agouti, full-color coats, then the
male is probably heterozygous for both traits.
(B)
If all of the oﬀspring had solid, dilute coats, then the male is
probably homozygous dominant for both traits.
(C)
If half of the oﬀspring had agouti, full-color coats and the
other half had solid, dilute coats, then th
