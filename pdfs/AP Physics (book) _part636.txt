eaches a vertical height of only 
on the
second hill, where it slows to a momentary stop, Fig. 6–27. It traveled a total
distance of 400 m. Determine the thermal energy produced and estimate the
average friction force (assume it is roughly constant) on the car, whose mass is
1000 kg.
APPROACH We explicitly follow the Problem Solving Strategy above.
SOLUTION
1. Draw a picture. See Fig. 6–27.
2. The system. The system is the roller-coaster car and the Earth (which exerts
the gravitational force). The forces acting on the car are gravity and friction.
(The normal force also acts on the car, but does no work, so it does not affect
the energy.) Gravity is accounted for as potential energy, and friction as 
a term 
3. Choose initial and final positions.We take point 1 to be the instant when the
car started coasting (at the top of the first hill), and point 2 to be the instant 
it stopped at a height of 
up the second hill.
4. Choose a reference frame. We choose the lowest point in the motion
