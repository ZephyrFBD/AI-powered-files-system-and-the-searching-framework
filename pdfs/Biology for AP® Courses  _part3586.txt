Lung Volumes and Capacities
Different animals have different lung capacities based on their activities. Cheetahs have evolved a much higher lung
capacity than humans; it helps provide oxygen to all the muscles in the body and allows them to run very fast. Elephants
also have a high lung capacity. In this case, it is not because they run fast but because they have a large body and must be
able to take up oxygen in accordance with their body size.
Human lung size is determined by genetics, sex, and height. At maximal capacity, an average lung can hold almost six liters
of air, but lungs do not usually operate at maximal capacity. Air in the lungs is measured in terms of lung volumes and
lung capacities (Figure 30.12 and Table 30.1). Volume measures the amount of air for one function (such as inhalation
or exhalation). Capacity is any two or more volumes (for example, how much can be inhaled from the end of a maximal
exhalation).
