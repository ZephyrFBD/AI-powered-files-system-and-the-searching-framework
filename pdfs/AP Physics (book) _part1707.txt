70. Suppose a power plant delivers energy at 880 MW using
steam turbines. The steam goes into the turbines superheated
at 625 K and deposits its unused heat in river water at 285 K.
Assume that the turbine operates as an ideal Carnot engine.
(a) If the river flow rate is 
estimate the average tem-
perature increase of the river water immediately downstream
from the power plant. (b) What is the entropy increase per
kilogram of the downstream river water in 
71. A car engine whose output power is 135 hp operates at
about 15% efficiency. Assume the engine’s water tempera-
ture of 85°C is its cold-temperature (exhaust) reservoir and
495°C is its thermal “intake” temperature (the temperature
of the exploding gas–air mixture). (a) What is the ratio 
of its efficiency relative to its maximum possible (Carnot)
efficiency? (b) Estimate how much power (in watts) goes
into moving the car, and how much heat, in joules and in
kcal, is exhausted to the air in 1.0 h.
