overcomes the limitation of genetic mapping and is not affected by increased or decreased recombination frequency.
Sequence mapping resulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps
with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs. The creation of genomic libraries and complementary
DNA (cDNA) libraries (collections of cloned sequences or all DNA from a genome) has sped up the process of physical
mapping. A genetic site used to generate a physical map with sequencing technology (a sequence-tagged site, or STS) is a
unique sequence in the genome with a known exact chromosomal location. An expressed sequence tag (EST) and a single
sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) are common STSs. An EST is a short STS that is identified with cDNA libraries,
while SSLPs are obtained from known genetic markers and provide a link between genetic maps and physical maps.
