ind the mirror, the corresponding distance is
negative. [An example of 
can be seen in Fig. 23–17, Example 23–6.]†
Thus the magnification (Eq. 23–3) is positive for an upright image and negative
for an inverted image (upside down). We summarize sign conventions more fully
in the Problem Solving Strategy following our discussion of convex mirrors later
in this Section.
Concave Mirror Examples
Image in a concave mirror. A 1.50-cm-high object is 
placed 20.0 cm from a concave mirror with radius of curvature 30.0 cm. Deter-
mine (a) the position of the image, and (b) its size.
APPROACH We determine the focal length from the radius of curvature
(Eq. 23–1),
The ray diagram is basically the same as
Fig. 23–16, since the object is between F and C. The position and size of the
image are found from Eqs. 23–2 and 23–3.
SOLUTION Referring to Fig. 23–16, we have
and
(a) We start with the mirror equation, Eq. 23–2, rearranging it (subtracting 
from both sides):
So
Because 
is positive, the image is
