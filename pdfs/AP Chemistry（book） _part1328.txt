. (c) CaO has a higher molar mass than either Ca or 
O. (d) The enthalpy of formation of CaO is small. (e) CaO is 
stable to atmospheric conditions.
 8.28 List the individual steps used in constructing a Bornâ€“Haber 
cycle for the formation of BaI2 from the elements. Which of 
the steps would you expect to be exothermic?
 8.29 Use data from Appendix C, Figure 7.10, and Figure 7.12 to cal-
culate the lattice energy of RbCl.
 8.30 (a) Based on the lattice energies of MgCl2 and SrCl2 given in 
Table 8.1, what is the range of values that you would expect 
for the lattice energy of CaCl2? (b) Using data from Appen-
dix C, Figure 7.11, Figure 7.13, and the value of the second 
ionization energy for Ca, 1145 kJ>mol, calculate the lattice 
energy of CaCl2.
