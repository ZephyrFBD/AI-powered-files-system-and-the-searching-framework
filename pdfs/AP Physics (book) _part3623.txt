cording to the theory, all massless and all have color

You might ask what would happen if we try to see a single quark with color
by reaching deep inside a hadron and extracting a single quark. Quarks are so
tightly bound to other quarks that extracting one would require a tremendous
amount of energy, so much that it would be sufficient to create more quarks
Indeed, such experiments are done at modern particle colliders and
all we get is more hadrons (quark–antiquark pairs, or triplets, which we observe
as mesons or baryons), never an isolated quark. This property of quarks, that
they are always bound in groups that are colorless, is called confinement.
The color force has the interesting property that, as two quarks approach
each other very closely (equivalently, have high energy), the force between them
becomes small. This aspect is referred to as asymptotic freedom.
The weak force, as we have seen, is thought to be mediated by the 
and 
particles. It acts between the “weak
