 allele
is required for expression of the trait in females.
You can also use the Punnett square to figure out the results of sex-linked traits. Here’s a classic example: a male
who has normal color vision and a woman who is a carrier for color blindness have children. How many of the
children will be color blind? To figure out the answer, let’s set up a Punnett square.
Notice that we placed a bar above any color blind-X to indicate the presence of a color blindness allele. And now for
the results. The couple could have a son who is color-blind, a son who sees color normally, a daughter who is a
carrier, or a daughter who sees color normally.
You will not need to know other X-linked conditions (like Rett Syndrome or
hemophilia) on test day, but if you are curious, you can find a short addendum
about such diseases in your online student tools.
Barr Bodies
A look at the cell nucleus of normal females will reveal a dark-staining body known as a Barr body. A Barr body is
an X chromosome tha
