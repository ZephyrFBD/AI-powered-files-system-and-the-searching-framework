2.2 Data Process 
Due to the various types of collected data as well as the inconsistent unit of the 
data, we need a consistent data to determine our indexes. Therefore, we process the 
datum by enabling them to be consistent. 
For the data that is quantitative, we transfer it into an index that belongs to [0, 1]. 
Different data has different ideal index, so we choose different functions that best fit 
the character of the data to process the data. For the data that is qualitative, we 
establish a fuzzy membership function to transfer the data into an index that belongs 
to [0, 1].
