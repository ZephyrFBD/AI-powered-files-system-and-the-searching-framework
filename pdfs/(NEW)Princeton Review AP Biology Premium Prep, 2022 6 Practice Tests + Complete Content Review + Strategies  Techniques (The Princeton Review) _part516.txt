ions. Enzyme concentration and
substrate concentration can also influence the rates of reaction.
If you’re asked to design an experiment to measure the effect of these four variables on enzyme activity, keep
all the conditions constant except for the variable of interest. For example, to measure the effects of pH in an
experiment, maintain the temperature, enzyme concentration, and substrate concentration constant as you
change pH.
