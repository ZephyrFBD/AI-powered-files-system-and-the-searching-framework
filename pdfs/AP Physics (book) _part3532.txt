rom each other. Assume that the
fragments are spherical (see Eq. 30–1) and compare your
calculation to the nuclear fission energy released, about
200 MeV.
26. (III) Suppose that the neutron multiplication factor is
1.0004. If the average time between successive fissions in a
chain of reactions is 1.0 ms, by what factor will the reaction
rate increase in 1.0 s?

27. (I) What is the average kinetic energy of protons at the
center of a star where the temperature is 
[Hint: See Eq. 13–8.]
28. (II) Show that the energy released in the fusion reaction
is 17.59 MeV.
29. (II) Show that the energy released when two deuterium
nuclei fuse to form 
with the release of a neutron is
3.27 MeV (Eq. 31–8b).
