Temperature and Kinetic Theory
1. Which has more atoms: 1 kg of lead or 1 kg of copper?
(See the Periodic Table or Appendix B.) Explain why.
2. Name several properties of materials that could be used 
to make a thermometer.
3. Which is larger, 1 C° or 1 F°? Explain why.
4. In the relation
should 
be the initial length,
the final length, or does it matter?
5. A flat bimetallic strip consists of a strip of aluminum riv-
eted to a strip of iron. When heated, the strip will bend.
Which metal will be on the outside of the curve? Why?
[Hint: See Table 13–1.]
