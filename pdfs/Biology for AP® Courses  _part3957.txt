these segments out of the gene, and splices one V segment to one J
segment. During RNA processing, all but one V and J segment are spliced out. Recombination and splicing may result in
over 106 possible VJ combinations. As a result, each differentiated B cell in the human body typically has a unique variable
chain. The constant domain, which does not bind antibody, is the same for all antibodies.

Figure 33.22 (a) As a germ-line B cell matures, an enzyme called DNA recombinase randomly excises V and J
segments from the light chain gene. Splicing at the mRNA level results in further gene rearrangement. As a result, (b)
each antibody has a unique variable region capable of binding a different antigen.
Similar to TCRs and BCRs, antibody diversity is produced by the mutation and recombination of approximately 300
different gene segments encoding the light and heavy chain varia
