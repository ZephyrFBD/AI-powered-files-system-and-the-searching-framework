Bohr model would have one electron ring, and a Bohr model would not give information about number of
electron in each ring
Activity
Create diagrams to show the placement of protons, neutrons, and electrons in an atom of carbon-12 and
carbon-14, respectably. Based on their subatomic difference(s), determine which element is an organism
more likely to use to synthesize glucose (C6H12O6) and give a reason for your choice.
Chemical Reactions and Molecules
All elements are most stable when their outermost shell is filled with electrons according to the octet rule. This is because
it is energetically favorable for atoms to be in that configuration and it makes them stable. However, since not all elements
have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells, atoms form chemical bonds with other atoms thereby obtaining the
electrons they need to attain a stable electron configuration. When two or more atoms chemically bond with each other,
the resultant chemical structure is a molecule. The fa
