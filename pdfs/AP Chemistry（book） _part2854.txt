0 km to 50 km is the stratosphere, 
and above it are the mesosphere and thermosphere. Notice in Figure 18.1 that the tempera-
ture extremes that form the boundaries between adjacent regions are denoted by the 
 
suffix -pause. The boundaries are important because gases mix across them relatively 
slowly. For example, pollutant gases generated in the troposphere pass through the tro-
popause and find their way into the stratosphere only very slowly.

Atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation (Figure 18.1), declining 
much more rapidly at lower elevations than at higher ones because of the atmosphere’s 
compressibility. Thus, the pressure decreases from an average value of 760 torr at sea level 
to 2.3 * 10-3 torr at 100 km, to only 1.0 * 10-6 torr at 200 km.
The troposphere and stratosphere together account for 99.9% of the mass of the 
atmosphere, 75% of which is the mass in the troposphere. Nevertheless, the thin upper
