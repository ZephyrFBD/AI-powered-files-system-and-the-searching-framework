le colliders (the LHC,
Section 32–1).
Dark matter makes up roughly 25% of the mass–energy of the universe,
according to the latest observations and models. Thus the total mass–energy is
25% dark matter plus 5% baryons for a total of about 30%, which does not bring 
up to 
What is the other 70%? We are not sure about that either, but we have
given it a name: “dark energy.”
Dark Energy—Cosmic Acceleration
In 1998, just before the turn of the millennium, two groups, one led by Saul
Perlmutter and the other by Brian Schmidt and Adam Riess (Fig. 33–32), reported
a huge surprise. Gravity was assumed to be the predominant force on a large scale
in the universe, and it was thought that the expansion of the universe ought to 
be slowing down in time because gravity acts as an attractive force between
objects. But measurements of Type Ia supernovae (our best standard candles—
see Section 33–3) unexpectedly showed that very distant (high z) supernovae
were dimmer than expected. That is, given the
