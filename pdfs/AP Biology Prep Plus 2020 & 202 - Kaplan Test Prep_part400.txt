osynthesis. Starting about 1.5 billion years ago,
photosynthesis helped to create the oxygen-rich atmosphere found on
Earth today, which allowed the evolution of animals requiring the
eﬀicient energy metabolism provided by aerobic respiration. The oxygen
produced through photosynthesis today maintains Earth’s oxygen and is
a key to the continued functioning of the biosphere.
Noncyclic Photophosphorylation
CALVIN CYCLE
In the second phase of photosynthesis, the energy captured in the light
reactions as ATP and NADPH is used to drive carbohydrate synthesis. This
cycle, oȇen called the Calvin cycle but also known as the Calvin-Benson
cycle, fixes CO2 into carbohydrates, reducing the fixed carbon to
carbohydrates through the addition of electrons. The NADPH provides
the reducing power for the reduction of CO2 to carbohydrates, and air
provides the carbon dioxide. CO2 first combines with, or is fixed to,
ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), a five-carbon sugar with two phosphate
groups. The enzyme
