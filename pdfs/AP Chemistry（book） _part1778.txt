 10- 2 atm?
(a) It sublimes at about -200 °C. (b) It melts at about -200 °C. 
(c) It boils at about -200 °C. (d) It condenses at about -200 °C. 
(e) It reaches the triple point at about -200 °C.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Use the phase diagram of methane to answer the following 
questions. (a) What is the normal boiling point of methane? 
(b) Over what pressure range does solid methane sublime?  
(c) Above what temperature does liquid methane not exist?
Check The pressure and temperature at the critical point are 
higher than those at the triple point, which is expected. Meth-
ane is the principal component of natural gas. So it seems reason-
able that it exists as a gas at 1 atm and 0 °C.
