higher GC
content would have a higher Tm.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) The two strands of a DNA double helix are held together by hydrogen bonds between the base pairs. AT
pairs form two hydrogen bonds, and the GC pairs form three hydrogen bonds. Since GC pairs form more
hydrogen bonds, that may make DNA with a higher GC content more stable across a wider range of
temperatures than DNA with a lower GC content.
(b)
(c) Yes, the claim that plants in colder climates have a higher GC content in their genomes is supported by the
data. B. pinnatum and D. caucasica are native to colder climates. Both also have statistically significantly
higher GC content in their genomes as compared to the species found in warmer winter locations (J. inflexus
and C. acutiformis), as shown in the graph for part (b).
(d) The plant with a GC content of 43.4% is more likely be native to an area with cold winters since its GC
content is closer to the GC contents found in B. pinnatum and D. caucasica.
