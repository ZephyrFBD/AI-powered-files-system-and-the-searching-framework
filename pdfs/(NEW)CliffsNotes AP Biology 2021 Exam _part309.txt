henotypic ratio Mendel found when using unlinked
genes. The 1:2:1 and 3:1 genotypic and phenotypic ratios are those expected from a typical monohybrid cross.
c. Crossing over occurs between linked genes. Instead of producing only two kinds of gametes—say AB and ab —
exchanges occur between homologous chromosomes, producing some Ab and aB gametes, quantities of which
depend on the frequency of crossing over. The frequency of crossing over increases as the distance between the gene
loci increases.
d. Sex-linkage occurs when a gene is located on one of the sex chromosomes, usually the X chromosome. For
example, in humans, hemophilia is inherited as a recessive allele on the X chromosome. Females receive two copies
of the gene, one on each of their X chromosomes. If they receive two recessive alleles, they are hemophiliacs. If they
receive two normal alleles, they are normal, but if they inherit one normal and one hemophilia allele, they will have
normal clotting abilities (because the nor
