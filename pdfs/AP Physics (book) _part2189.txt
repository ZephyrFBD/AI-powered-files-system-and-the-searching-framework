magnetic field direction, downward in Fig. 20–11a. If the current is reversed
in direction, the force is in the opposite direction, upward as shown in Fig. 20–11b.
Experiments show that the direction of the force is always perpendicular to the
direction of the current and also perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field,
The direction of the force is given by another right-hand rule, as illustrated in
Fig. 20–11c. Orient your right hand until your outstretched fingers can point in
the direction of the conventional current I, and when you bend your fingers they
point in the direction of the magnetic field lines,
Then your outstretched thumb
will point in the direction of the force 
on the wire.
This right-hand rule describes the direction of the force. What about the mag-
nitude of the force on the wire? It is found experimentally that the magnitude of
the force is directly proportional to the current I in the wire, to the magnetic 
field B (assumed uniform), and to the length
