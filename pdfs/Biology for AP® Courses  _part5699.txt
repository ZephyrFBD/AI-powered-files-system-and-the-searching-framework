e the simulation and this is
symbolically known as ‘Adam and Eve’ who leĞ the ‘garden’ (prime
reality) and ‘fell’ into Matrix reality. The simulation is not a
‘physical’ construct (there is no ‘physical’); it is a source of
information. Think Wi-Fi again. The simulation is an energetic ﬁeld
encoded with information and body-brain systems are designed to
decode that information encoded in wave or frequency form which
is transmiĴed to the brain as electrical signals. These are decoded by
the brain to construct our sense of reality – an illusory ‘physical’
world that only exists in the brain or the mind. Virtual reality games
mimic this process using the same sensory decoding system.
Information is fed to the senses to decode a virtual reality that can
appear so real, but isn’t (Figs 18 and 19). Some scientists believe –
and I agree with them – that what we perceive as ‘physical’ reality
only exists when we are looking or observing. The act of perception
or focus triggers the decoding sys
