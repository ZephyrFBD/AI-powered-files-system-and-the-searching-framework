The movement of a plant subjected to constant directional pressure is called thigmotropism, from the Greek words thigma
meaning “touch,” and tropism implying “direction.” Tendrils are one example of this. The meristematic region of tendrils
is very touch sensitive; light touch will evoke a quick coiling response. Cells in contact with a support surface contract,
whereas cells on the opposite side of the support expand (Figure 23.14). Application of jasmonic acid is sufficient to trigger
tendril coiling without a mechanical stimulus.
A thigmonastic response is a touch response independent of the direction of stimulus Figure 23.24. In the Venus flytrap,
two modified leaves are joined at a hinge and lined with thin fork-like tines along the outer edges. Tiny hairs are located
inside the trap. When an insect brushes against these trigger hairs, touching two or more of them in succession, the leaves
close quickly, trapping the prey. Glands on the leaf surface secrete enzymes that slowly d
