work as laboratory chemists, 
developing new products (research and development); analyzing mate-
rials (quality control); or assisting customers in  
using products (sales and 
service). Those with more experience or training may work as managers 
or company directors. Chemists are important members of the scien-
tific workforce in government (the National Institutes of Health, De-
partment of Energy, and Environmental Protection Agency all employ 
chemists) and at universities. A chemistry degree is also good prepara-
tion for careers in teaching, medicine, biomedical research, information 
science, environmental work, technical sales, government regulatory 
agencies, and patent law.
Fundamentally, chemists do three things: They (1) make 
new types of matter: materials, substances, or combinations of 
substances with desired proerties; (2) measure the properties of 
matter; and (3) develop models that explain and/or predict the 
properties of matter. One chemist, for example, may wor
