larities of the
solutions on the x-axis and the percent change in mass on the y-axis. The
point of the line of best fit that crosses the x-axis is the molarity where
there was no change in the mass of the potato and represents the molarity
inside the potato cell; see Figures 19.9 and 19.10.

Part 3: Observe osmosis in living cells.
OBJECTIVE
Observe plasmolysis in a living plant (elodea) cell.
Tear a thin piece of healthy elodea tissue, and prepare a wet mount. Locate
a single layer of cells under the light microscope at 40Ã— with clearly
visible chloroplasts. While observing the slide, expose the tissue to 5%
(hypertonic) sodium chloride solution. Observe changes in the cytoplasm
of the cell as water suddenly diffuses out of the cell from high water
potential to low water potential. The cytoplasm will shrink (plasmolysis),
a
