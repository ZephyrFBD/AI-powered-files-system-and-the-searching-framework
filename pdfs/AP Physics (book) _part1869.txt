cause they can be recharged
more than 
times with no degradation.] Such high-capacitance capacitors can
be made of activated carbon which has very high porosity, so that the surface area
is very large; one-tenth of a gram of activated carbon can have a surface area of
Furthermore, the equal and opposite charges exist in an electric “double
layer” about 
thick. Thus, the capacitance of 0.1 g of activated carbon,
whose internal area can be 
is equivalent to a parallel-plate capacitor with
The proportionality,
in Eq. 17–8, is valid also for a parallel-plate
capacitor that is rolled up into a spiral cylinder, as in Fig. 17–13b. However, the
constant factor,
must be replaced if an insulator such as paper separates the
plates, as is usual, as discussed in the next Section.
One type of microphone is a condenser, or capacitor, microphone, diagrammed
in Fig. 17–16. The changing air pressure in a sound wave causes one plate of the
capacitor C to move back and forth. The voltage across the capaci
