 spectrum has a peak, like those in Fig. 29–34a, but is wider,
100–200 nm at half maximum. The organic molecules are chosen so that the
photons have frequencies in the color range desired, say for a display subpixel:
bluish (B), greenish (G), or red (R).
The conductive layer is also called the hole transport layer (HTL), which
name expresses its purpose. The emissive layer, on the other hand (Fig. 29–38),
serves two purposes: (1) it serves to transport electrons toward the junction, and
(2) it is in this layer (near the junction) that holes meet electrons to form excitons
and then combine and emit light. These two functions can be divided in a more
sophisticated OLED that has three layers: Adjacent to the cathode is the 
electron transport layer (ETL), plus there is an emissive layer (EML) sandwiched
between the ETL and the HTL. The emissive layer can be complex, containing a
host material plus a guest compound in small concentration—a kind of doping—
to fine-tune energy levels and eff
