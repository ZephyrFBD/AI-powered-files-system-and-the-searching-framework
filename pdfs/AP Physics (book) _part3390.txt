me when the rock solidified can be determined.
Radioactive dating methods using 
and other isotopes have shown the
age of the oldest Earth rocks to be about 
The age of rocks in which
the oldest fossilized organisms are embedded indicates that life appeared more
than 
billion years ago. The earliest fossilized remains of mammals are found in
rocks 200 million years old, and humanlike creatures seem to have appeared
more than 2 million years ago. Radioactive dating has been indispensable for the
reconstruction of Earth’s history.
30–12 Stability and Tunneling
Radioactive decay occurs only if the mass of the parent nucleus is greater than
the sum of the masses of the daughter nucleus and all particles emitted. For
example,
can decay to 
because the mass of 
is greater than the
mass of the 
plus the mass of the 
particle. Because systems tend to go in
the direction that reduces their internal or potential energy (a ball rolls downhill,
a positive charge moves toward a negative charge), yo
