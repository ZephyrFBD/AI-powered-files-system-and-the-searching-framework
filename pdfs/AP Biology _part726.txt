they change their location and move to a warmer or cooler spot.
Choice A is incorrect because a dolphin could not maintain a body
temperature that low. Choices B and C are incorrect because they do
not depict both the dolphin having a constant body temperature and
the fish having a body temperature that varies with the
environmental temperature.
(C) The mouse is a mammal, and as such, it maintains a constant
body temperature. In this case, the temperature in the environment
