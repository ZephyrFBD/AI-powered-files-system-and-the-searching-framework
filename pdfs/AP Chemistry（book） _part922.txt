Because the diameter of a hydrogen atom is about 1 * 10 - 10 m, the uncertainty in 
the position of the electron in the atom is an order of magnitude greater than the size 
of the atom. Thus, we have essentially no idea where the electron is located in the atom. 
On the other hand, if we were to repeat the calculation with an object of ordinary mass, 
such as a tennis ball, the uncertainty would be so small that it would be inconsequential. 
In that case, m is large and ∆x is out of the realm of measurement and therefore of no 
practical consequence.
De Broglie’s hypothesis and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle set the stage for 
a new and more broadly applicable theory of atomic structure. In this approach, any 
attempt to define precisely the instantaneous location and momentum of the elec-
tron is abandoned. The wave nature of the electron is recognized, and its behavior is 
described in terms  
appropriate to waves. The res
