) Which of the following explanations accounts for the 
fact that the ion–solvent interaction is greater for Li+ 
than for K+?
   a. Li+ is of lower mass than K+.
   b. The ionization energy of Li is higher than that for K.
   c. Li+ has a smaller ionic radius than K+.
   d. Li has a lower density than K.
   e. Li reacts with water more slowly than K. [Section 13.1]
 13.3  Consider two ionic solids, both composed of singly charged 
ions, that have different lattice energies. (a) Will the solids 
have the same solubility in water? (b) If not, which solid 
will be more soluble in water, the one with the larger lattice 
energy or the one with the smaller lattice energy? Assume 
that solute–solvent interactions are the same for both sol-
ids. [Section 13.1]
 13.4  Which two statements about gas mixtures are true? 
 
[Section 13.1]
(a) Gases always mix with other gases because the gas par-
ticles are too far apart to feel significant intermolecular 
attractions or repulsions.
(b) Just like
