 (a) Refine the student’s model by placing “Lys” at the correct position on the phylogenetic tree to 
indicate where the Arg-to-Lys mutation most likely occurred. Provide ONE piece of reasoning  
to support your placement of “Lys” on the phylogenetic tree. (2 points maximum; LO 1.10)

• 
Correctly places “lys” on branch leading to Gorilla 
 
 
LYS 
 
Reasoning (1 point) 
• 
Gorillas are the only species in the clade with “lys.”  
• 
The mutation could only have occurred in the branch that uniquely leads to the gorillas.  
• 
If the mutation occurred on the main branch before the gorilla line, then the chimp and 
human lines would also be affected. 
 
(b) Predict the most likely single mutation affecting amino acid 104 in the species and justify how  
β-hemoglobin can function normally in all four species despite the mutation.
