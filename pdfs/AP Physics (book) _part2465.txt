22–6 Momentum Transfer and
Radiation Pressure
If electromagnetic waves carry energy, then we would expect them to also carry
linear momentum. When an electromagnetic wave encounters the surface of an
object, a force will be exerted on the surface as a result of the momentum trans-
fer 
just as when a moving object strikes a surface. The force per
unit area exerted by the waves is called radiation pressure, and its existence was
predicted by Maxwell. He showed that if a beam of EM radiation (light, for
example) is completely absorbed by an object, then the momentum transferred is
