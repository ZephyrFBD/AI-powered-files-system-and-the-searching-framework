sk at the Individual Level
Predicting the risk of disease involves screening currently healthy individuals by genome analysis at the individual level.
Intervention with lifestyle changes and drugs can be recommended before disease onset. However, this approach is most
applicable when the problem resides within a single gene defect. Such defects only account for approximately 5 percent
of diseases in developed countries. Most of the common diseases, such as heart disease, are multi-factored or polygenic,
which is a phenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes, and also involve environmental factors such as diet.
In April 2010, scientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual (Stephen Quake, a
scientist at Stanford University, who had his genome sequenced); the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various
diseases. A risk assessment was performed to analyze Quakeâ€™s percentage of risk for 55 different medical conditions. A rare
