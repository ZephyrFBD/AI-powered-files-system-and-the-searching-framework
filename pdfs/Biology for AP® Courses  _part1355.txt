To prepare a forked-line diagram for a cross between F1 heterozygotes resulting from a cross between AABBCC and aabbcc
parents, we first create rows equal to the number of genes being considered, and then segregate the alleles in each row
on forked lines according to the probabilities for individual monohybrid crosses (Figure 12.17). We then multiply the
values along each forked path to obtain the F2 offspring probabilities. Note that this process is a diagrammatic version of
the product rule. The values along each forked pathway can be multiplied because each gene assorts independently. For a
trihybrid cross, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 27:9:9:9:3:3:3:1.
Figure 12.17 The forked-line method can be used to analyze a trihybrid cross. Here, the probability for color in
the F2 generation occupies the top row (3 yellow:1 green). The probability for shape occupies the second row (3
round:1 wrinked), and the probability for height occupies the third row (3 tall:1 dwarf). The probability fo
