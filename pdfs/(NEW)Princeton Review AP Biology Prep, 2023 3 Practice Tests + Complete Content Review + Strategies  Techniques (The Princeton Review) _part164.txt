ino acids can react with each other to form a covalent disulfide bond that
stabilizes the tertiary structure. Tertiary structure often minimizes the free energy of the molecule and locks it into a
stable 3D shape.
Lastly, several different polypeptide chains sometimes interact with each other to form a quaternary structure. The
different polypeptide chains that come together are often called subunits of the final whole protein.
A classic example of a protein with quaternary structure is hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a molecule in the blood that
helps distribute oxygen to the tissues in the body. It is formed when four separate polypeptide chains interact with
each other. Each of the four polypeptide chains create a subunit of the final hemoglobin protein.
Only proteins that have folded correctly into their specific three-dimensional structure can perform their function
properly. Mistakes in the amino acid chain can create oddly shaped proteins that are nonfunctional.
