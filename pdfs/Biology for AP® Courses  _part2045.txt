beneficial to their survival. For living
organisms to adapt and change to environmental pressures, genetic variation must be present. With genetic variation,
individuals have differences in form and function that allow some to survive certain conditions better than others. These
organisms pass their favorable traits to their offspring. Eventually, environments change, and what was once a desirable,
advantageous trait may become an undesirable trait and organisms may further evolve. Evolution may be convergent with
similar traits evolving in multiple species or divergent with diverse traits evolving in multiple species that came from a
common ancestor. Evidence of evolution can be observed by means of DNA code and the fossil record, and also by the
existence of homologous and vestigial structures.
18.2 Formation of New Species
Speciation occurs along two main pathways: geographic separation (allopatric speciation) and through mechanisms that
occur within a shared habitat (sympatric spec
