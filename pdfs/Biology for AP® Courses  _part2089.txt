Scientists could look in the fossil record to find
the plantsâ€™ most recent common ancestor. They
could also check the surrounding mountains to
determine if the most recent common ancestor is
still living.
c.
Scientists could breed the two groups in the
same environment and observe whether, over
several generations, they begin to look more
similar. They could also switch the groups,
growing the high-altitude plants at low altitude
and the low-altitude plants at high altitude, and
observe whether the former begin to look like
low-altitude plants and the latter begin to look
like high-altitude plants.
d.
Scientists could collect seeds and test whether
they might be cross-pollinated to produce fertile
offspring. They could also investigate the area
between 2,500 meters and 2,300 meters to see if
fertile hybrid populations might be found living
between the two other populations of plants.
64. Populations of a plant species have been found
growing in the mountains at altitudes above 2,500 m
