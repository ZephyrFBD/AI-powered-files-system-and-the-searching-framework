response. B
cells produce and release antibodies to neutralize antigens in
humoral response. Clonal selection is a fundamental mechanism
of the immune system whereby one particular lymphocyte that
matches a specific antigen is identified and activated.
There are two types of immunity: passive and active. Passive
immunity arises when antibodies are passed from one individual to
another, such as in motherâ€™s milk or an injection of gamma
globulin. Active immunity results when a person makes his or her
own antibodies after exposure to a particular antigen, such as after
receiving an immunization or after being infected with a virus.
Specificity of the immune response is of extreme importance. A
primary exposure to an antigen evokes an immune response
specific to that antigen only. A second exposure to the same antigen
is more rapid and stronger than the first.
Another important topic is regulation by feedback mechanisms. In
this chapter, we reviewed an example of positive feedback. Helper
