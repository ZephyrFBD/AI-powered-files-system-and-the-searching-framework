the Hawaiian islands.
a.
Population size can be determined by life tables.
The area of the island in square kilometers is
divided by the population size to determine the
density of the bird population.
b.
Population size can be determined by the mark
and recapture method. The population size is
divided by the area of the island in square
kilometers to determine the density of the bird
population.
c.
Population size can be determined by life tables.
The population size is divided by the area of the
island in square kilometers to determine the
density of the bird population.
d.
Population size can be determined by the mark
and recapture method. The area of the island in
square kilometers is divided by the population
size to determine the density of the bird
population.
54. Give examples of how two different populations of
organisms might have the same population density, but
different dispersal patterns.
a.
Two populations could occupy the same range
with the same number of individuals,
