arpentry is geometry and 
 
 geometry is carpentry.Without Euclid this very school could never 
 
 have been built. 
 
 Paddy Clohessy mutters behind me, Feckin’ Euclid. 
 
 Dotty barks at him.You, boy, what is your name? 
 
 Clohessy, sir. 
 
 Ah, the boy flies on one wing.What is your Christian name? 
 
 Paddy. 
 
 Paddy what? 
 
 Paddy, sir. 
 
 And what, Paddy,were you saying to McCourt? 
 
 I said we should get down on our two knees and thank God for 
 
 Euclid. 
 
  
  
 I’m sure you did, Clohessy. I see the lie festering in your teeth.What 
 
 do I see, boys? 
 
 The lie, sir. 
 
 And what is the lie doing, boys? 
 
 Festering, sir. 
 
 Where, boys, where? 
 
 In his teeth, sir. 
 
 Euclid, boys,was a Greek.What, Clohessy, is a Greek? 
 
 Some class of a foreigner, sir. 
 
 Clohessy, you are a half-wit. Now, Brendan, surely you know what 
 
 a Greek is? 
 
 Yes, sir. Euclid was a Greek. 
 
 Dotty gives him the little smile.He tells Clohessy he should model 
 
 himself on Quigley
