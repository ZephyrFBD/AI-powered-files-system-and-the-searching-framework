Allows bacteria to form a layer on host tissue, protecting
bacteria not directly exposed to extracellular fluid
(ECF)
Provides a reservoir for nutrients that bind to glycocalyx;
these nutrients then are made available to bacterial
cell
Accumulates and stores waste products, preventing them
from interfering with bacterial cell metabolism
