elk. (credit: USGS Northern Prairie Wildlife Research
Center)
a.
Through natural selection, female elk that did
not have the energy reserves to carry a
pregnancy to term and did not become pregnant
died whereas those which became pregnant
anyway were favored.
b.
Natural selection favored the selection of traits
preventing pregnancies in female elk with low
fat reserves, so this trait has become
predominant in natural elk herds observed today.
c.
Natural selection randomly changes the
frequency of genes allowing traits preventing
pregnancies in female elk with low fat reserves
to be favored.
d.
Natural selection leads to a sudden inheritable
change in the genome of the female elk,
ensuring female elk with very high fat reserves
to effectively carry out pregnancy.
89. Research on elk in Yellowstone National Park was
conducted to determine how body condition affects
survival of the elk over the winter months. It was found
that the probability o
