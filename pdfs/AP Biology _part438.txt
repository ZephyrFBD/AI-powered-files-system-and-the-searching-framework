the land, often over great distances, looking for another pride to join. If

5. Diploidy
Diploidy, the 2n condition, maintains and hides a huge pool of alleles that
may be harmful in the present environment but that could be advantageous
when conditions change in the future.
6. Heterozygote Advantage
Heterozygote advantage preserves multiple alleles in a population. It is a
phenomenon in which the hybrid individual is selected for because it has
greater reproductive success. The hybrids are sometimes better adapted
than the homozygotes. Notice that heterozygote advantage is defined in
terms of genotyp
