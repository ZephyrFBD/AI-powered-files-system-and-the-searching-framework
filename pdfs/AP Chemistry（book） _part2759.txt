that acid–base equilibria 
take place simultaneously with solubility equilibria. In particular, 
both basic anions and cations with high charge-to-size ratios undergo 
hydrolysis reactions that can measurably increase the solubilities of 
their salts. For example, CaCO3 contains the basic carbonate ion 
1Kb = 1.8 * 10-42, which reacts with water:
CO3
2 -1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ HCO3
-1aq2 + OH-1aq2
If we consider the effect of ion–ion interactions as well as simul-
taneous solubility and Kb equilibria, we calculate a solubility of 
1.4 * 10-4 mol>L, in agreement with the measured value for calcite.
Finally, we generally assume that ionic compounds dissociate 
completely when they dissolve, but this assumption is not always 
valid. When MgF2 dissolves, for example, it yields not only Mg2 +  and 
F- ions but also MgF+ ions.
