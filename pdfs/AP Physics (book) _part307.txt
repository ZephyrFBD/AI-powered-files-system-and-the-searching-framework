hute (Fig. 3–37).
(a) How long is the jumper in free fall? Ignore air resis-
tance. (b) It is important to be as far away from the cliff
as possible before opening the parachute. How far from
the cliff is this jumper when she opens her chute?

27. (II) A projectile is fired with an initial speed of 
at an angle of 42.2° above the horizontal on a long flat
firing range. Determine (a) the maximum height reached
by the projectile, (b) the total time in the air, (c) the total
horizontal distance covered (that is, the range), and (d) the
speed of the projectile 1.50 s after firing.

22. (II) A football is kicked at ground level with a speed of
at an angle of 31.0° to the horizontal. How much
later does it hit the ground?
23. (II) A fire hose held near the ground shoots water at a
speed of 
At what angle(s) should the nozzle point
in order that the water land 2.5 m away (Fig. 3–36)? Why
are there two different angles?
