e protein, whereas amino acids with polar R groups were 
primarily on the surface of the protein. Which of the following best explains the 
location of the amino acids in the folded protein?
(A)	Polar R groups on the surface of the protein can form ionic bonds with the 
charged ends of the water molecules.
(B)	 Polar R groups are too bulky to fit in the middle of the protein and are 
pushed toward the protein’s surface.
(C)	 Nonpolar R groups that cannot form hydrogen bonds with water are 
pushed into the middle of the protein.
(D)	Nonpolar R groups from different parts of the protein form covalent bonds 
with each other to maintain the protein’s structure.
13. The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, is native to North America and 
originally fed on fruit of the wild hawthorn. Since the mid-1800s, a population
