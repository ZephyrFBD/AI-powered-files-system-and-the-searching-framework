for transcription, the regulation is pre-transcriptional.
44. C
Trypsin is an enzyme. Enzymes are proteins and organic catalysts that speed up reactions without altering
them. They are not consumed in the process. Therefore, you can eliminate (A) and (B). The rate of reaction can
be affected by the concentration of the substrate up to a point, so (D) can be eliminated.
45. B
DNA helicase unwinds the double helix, so (A) is incorrect. Choice (B), which states that DNA ligase seals the
discontinuous Okazaki fragments, is true. DNA polymerase, not RNA polymerase, is the enzyme that causes
the DNA strands to elongate, so (C) is incorrect. In the presence of DNA polymerase, DNA strands always
grow in the 5′ to 3′ direction as complementary bases attach. Therefore, (D) is also incorrect.
46. A
Ecosystems high in variation are more resilient than those with low biodiversity, so eliminate (B). Meiosis
provides genetic variation but mitosis should provide almost none, so eliminate (C). Since cr
