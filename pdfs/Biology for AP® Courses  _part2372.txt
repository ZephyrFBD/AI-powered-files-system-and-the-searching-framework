killed viruses, or molecular subunits of the virus. The
killed viral vaccines and subunit viruses are both incapable of causing disease.
Live viral vaccines are designed in the laboratory to cause few symptoms in recipients while giving them protective
immunity against future infections. Polio was one disease that represented a milestone in the use of vaccines. Mass
immunization campaigns in the 1950s (killed vaccine) and 1960s (live vaccine) significantly reduced the incidence of the
disease, which caused muscle paralysis in children and generated a great amount of fear in the general population when
regional epidemics occurred. The success of the polio vaccine paved the way for the routine dispensation of childhood
vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and other diseases.
The danger of using live vaccines, which are usually more effective than killed vaccines, is the low but significant
danger that these viruses will revert to their disease-causing form by back mutati
