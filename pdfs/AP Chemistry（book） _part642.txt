4.4 The concept of chemical equilibrium is very important. 
Which one of the following statements is the most correct 
way to think about equilibrium?
 
 (a) If a system is at equilibrium, nothing is happening.
 
 (b)  
If a system is at equilibrium, the rate of the forward reac-
tion is equal to the rate of the back reaction.
 
 (c)  
If a system is at equilibrium, the product concentration is 
changing over time. [Section 4.1]
 
4.5 You are presented with a white solid and told that due to 
careless labeling it is not clear if the substance is barium 
chloride, lead chloride, or zinc chloride. When you transfer 
the solid to a beaker and add water, the solid dissolves to give 
a clear solution. Next a Na2SO41aq2 solution is added and 
a white precipitate forms. What is the identity of the un-
known white solid? [Section 4.2]
