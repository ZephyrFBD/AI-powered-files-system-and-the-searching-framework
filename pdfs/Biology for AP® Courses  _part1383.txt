ng meiosis, Mendelâ€™s law of independent assortment refers to
genes, not chromosomes, and a single chromosome may carry more than 1,000 genes. When genes are located in close
proximity on the same chromosome, their alleles tend to be inherited together. This results in offspring ratios that violate
Mendel's law of independent assortment. However, recombination serves to exchange genetic material on homologous
chromosomes such that maternal and paternal alleles may be recombined on the same chromosome. This is why alleles on
a given chromosome are not always inherited together. Recombination is a random event occurring anywhere on a
chromosome. Therefore, genes that are far apart on the same chromosome are likely to still assort independently because
of recombination events that occurred in the intervening chromosomal space.
Whether or not they are sorting independently, genes may interact at the level of gene products such that the expression of
an allele for one gene masks or modifies
