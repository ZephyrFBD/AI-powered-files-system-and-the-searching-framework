A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule, meaning it has a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part. The fatty acid chains are
hydrophobic and cannot interact with water, whereas the phosphate-containing group is hydrophilic and interacts with water
(Figure 3.21).

Figure 3.21 The phospholipid bilayer is the major component of all cellular membranes. The hydrophilic head groups
of the phospholipids face the aqueous solution. The hydrophobic tails are sequestered in the middle of the bilayer.
The head is the hydrophilic part, and the tail contains the hydrophobic fatty acids. In a membrane, a bilayer of phospholipids
forms the matrix of the structure, the fatty acid tails of phospholipids face inside, away from water, whereas the phosphate
group faces the outside, aqueous side (Figure 3.21).
Phospholipids are responsible for the dynamic nature of the plasma membrane. If a drop of phospholipids is placed in water,
it spontaneously forms a structure
