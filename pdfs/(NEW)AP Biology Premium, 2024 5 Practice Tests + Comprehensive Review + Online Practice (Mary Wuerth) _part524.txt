bility to perform photosynthesis will be reduced,
and some producers will die. If the population size of producers in an ecosystem decreases, the entire ecosystem will
be disrupted. An example of this is the rise in ocean temperatures, which has led to the death of producers in coral
reefs (coral bleaching). This, in turn, has led to massive decreases in the number of species and in population sizes
of these species in coral reef ecosystems.
Trophic levels represent steps in the food and energy transfers between organisms in an ecosystem. Organisms
are classified into trophic levels based on their food and energy sources. Energy is captured by and then moves from
producers to herbivores (primary consumers) to carnivores and omnivores (secondary, tertiary, and quaternary
consumers).
Food chains show the transfer of energy between these trophic levels. It is important to note that in a food chain,
the arrows show the direction of the transfer of energy. Figure 22.1 provides an example of
