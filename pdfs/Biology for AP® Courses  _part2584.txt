D. Heterocysts form along the filament separated by a
fixed number of vegetative cells. Based on your model of
the regulation of heterocyst development, make and
support a claim that accounts for this pattern.
81. Escherichia coli Strain A is able to grow in a minimal
medium only when supplemented with methionine and
biotin. Strain B is able to grow in a minimal medium only
when supplemented with threonine, leucine, and thiamine.
The two strains are incubated together in a medium
containing each supplement. They are then transferred to a
minimal medium with no supplements, and each strain is
able to grow under these conditions.
A. Describe the evidence that supports information
exchange between Strain A and Strain B, and the
mechanisms that can account for this behavior
demonstrated by Lederberg and Tatum (Nature, 1946).
Colistin is regarded as a last-resort antibiotic in the
treatment of multi-drug-resistant, gram-negative bacteria.
