complete form, consider a
system that is moving so it has kinetic energy KE, and suppose there is also potential
energy PE. Then the first law of thermodynamics would have to include these terms
and would be written as
(15;2)
¢ke + ¢pe + ¢U = Q - W.

Kinetic energy transformed to thermal energy. A 3.0-g
bullet traveling at a speed of 
enters a tree and exits the other side with a speed
of 
Where did the bullet’s lost KE go, and how much energy was transferred?
APPROACH Take the bullet and tree as our system. No potential energy is
involved. No work is done on (or by) the system by outside forces, nor is any
heat added because no energy was transferred to or from the system due to a
temperature difference. Thus the kinetic energy gets transformed into internal
energy of the bullet and tree. This answers the first question.
SOLUTION In the first law of thermodynamics as written in Eq. 15–2, we are
given
so we have
or, using subscripts i and f for initial and final velocities,
NOTE The i
