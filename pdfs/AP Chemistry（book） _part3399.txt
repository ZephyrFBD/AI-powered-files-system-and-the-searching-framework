28Ni atom is 59.930788 amu.
Solve 
A 60
27Co atom has 27 electrons. The mass of an 
electron is 5.4858 * 10-4 amu. (See the list 
of fundamental constants in the back inside 
cover.) We subtract the mass of the 27 elec-
trons from the mass of the 60
27Co atom to find 
the mass of the 60
27Co nucleus:
Analyze We are asked to calculate the energy change in a nuclear 
reaction.
Plan We must first calculate the mass change in the process. We 
are given atomic masses, but we need the masses of the nuclei in 
the reaction. We calculate these by taking account of the masses 
of the electrons that contribute to the atomic masses.
