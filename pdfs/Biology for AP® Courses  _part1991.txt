so observed evolution occurring in both the laboratory and in the wild. A common example of this is the
spread of antibiotic resistant genes in a population of bacteria. When bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, alleles that help the
organism survive increase in frequency Figure 18.9. This is because individuals that cannot resist the antibacterial die off,
leaving only individuals with the resistance gene to reproduce.

Adaptations for homeostasis
One major reason that organisms adapt is to maintain homeostasis, one of the main characteristics of life. All organisms
have likely descended from a single common ancestor, which is why so many organisms share anatomical, morphological,
and molecular features. However, each organism has adapted these similar features to suit their environment and adapt to
