sn’t want to be 
 
 looking at Africa. 
 
 We have to keep dragging the bag or we’ll never have our Christmas 
 
 dinner. It will take ages to get a fire going and ages more to get our 
 
 dinner because the water has to be boiling when Mam puts in the head 
 
 of cabbage and the potatoes to keep the pig company in the pot.We 
 
 drag the bag up O’Connell Avenue and we see people in their houses 
 
 sitting around tables with all kinds of decorations and bright lights. At 
 
 one house they push up the window and the children point and laugh 
 
 and call to us, Look at the Zulus.Where are yeer spears? 
 
 Malachy makes faces at them and wants to throw coal at them but 
 
 I tell him if he throws coal there’s less for the pig and we’ll never get 
 
 our dinner. 
 
  
  
 The downstairs in our house is a lake again from the rain pouring 
 
 under the door but it doesn’t matter because we’re drenched anyway 
 
 and we can wade through the water. Dad comes down and drags the 
 
 bag upstai
