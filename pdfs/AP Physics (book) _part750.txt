Summary
EXERCISE H A woman stands up in a rowboat and walks from one end of the boat to
the other. How does the boat move, as seen from the shore?
An interesting application is the discovery of nearby stars (see Section 5–8)
that seem to “wobble.”What could cause such a wobble? It could be that a planet
orbits the star, and each exerts a gravitational force on the other. The planets are
too small and too far away to be observed directly by telescopes. But the slight
wobble in the motion of the star suggests that both the planet and the star (its sun)
orbit about their mutual center of mass, and hence
