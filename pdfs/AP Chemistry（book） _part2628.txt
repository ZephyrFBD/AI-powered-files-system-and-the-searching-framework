jugate acid) are called a conjugate acid–base pair.
The acid–base strengths of conjugate acid–base pairs are re-
lated: The stronger an acid, the weaker is its conjugate base; the 
weaker an acid, the stronger is its conjugate base. In every acid–base 
reaction, the position of the equilibrium favors the transfer of the 
proton from the stronger acid to the stronger base.
AUTOIONIZATION OF WATER (SECTION 16.3) Water ionizes to 
a slight degree, forming H+1aq2 and OH-1aq2. The extent of this 
autoionization is expressed by the ion-product constant for water: 
Kw = 3H+43OH-4 = 1.0 * 10-14 125 °C2. This relationship holds for 
both pure water and aqueous solutions. The Kw expression indi-
cates that the product of 3H+4 and 3OH-4 is a constant. Thus, as 3H+4 
increases, 3OH-4 decreases. Acidic solutions are those that contain 
more H+1aq2 than OH-1aq2, whereas basic solutions contain more 
OH-1aq2 than H+1aq2. When 3H+4 = 3OH-4, the solution is neutral.
