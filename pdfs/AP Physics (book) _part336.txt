it moving from rest, or to stop it when it is moving, or to change its velocity sideways
out of a straight-line path. A truck has much more inertia than a baseball moving
at the same speed, and a much greater force is needed to change the truck’s
velocity at the same rate as the ball’s. The truck therefore has much more mass.
To quantify the concept of mass, we must define a standard. In SI units, the
unit of mass is the kilogram (kg) as we discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1–5.
The terms mass and weight are often confused with one another, but it is
important to distinguish between them. Mass is a property of an object itself
(a measure of an object’s inertia, or its “quantity of matter”). Weight, on the other
hand, is a force, the pull of gravity acting on an object. To see the difference,
suppose we take an object to the Moon. The object will weigh only about one-sixth
as much as it did on Earth, since the force of gravity is weaker. But its mass will
be the same. It will have the sa
