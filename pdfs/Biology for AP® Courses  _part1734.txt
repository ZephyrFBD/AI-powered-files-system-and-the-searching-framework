Introduction
Most people know that regular exercise is important to maintain good health. It promotes cardiovascular health and helps
to prevent obesity. Scientists have now discovered that long-term endurance training also changes how genes are expressed
in muscle tissue. In a recent study, 23 healthy people each exercised one leg for 45 minutes four days a week while resting
the other leg. After three months, muscles from participantsâ€™ legs were biopsied, and scientists analyzed the activity level
of over 20,
