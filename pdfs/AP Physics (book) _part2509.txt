LAW OF REFLECTION
†In a uniform transparent medium such as air or glass: But not always, such as for nonuniform air 
that allows optical illusions and mirages which we discuss in Section 24–2 (Fig. 24–4).
When light is incident upon a rough surface, even microscopically rough such
as this page, it is reflected in many directions, as shown in Fig. 23–3. This is called
diffuse reflection. The law of reflection still holds, however, at each small section
of the surface. Because of diffuse reflection in all directions, an ordinary object
can be seen at many different angles by the light reflected from it. When you move
your head to the side, different reflected rays reach your eye from each point 
on the object (such as this page), Fig. 23–4a. Let us compare diffuse reflection to
reflection from a mirror, which is known as specular reflection. (“Speculum” is
