ause of its polarity
and hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding means the attraction between the positive side (hydrogen) of
one water molecule and the negative side (oxygen) of another water molecule.
B. Water is a very good solvent of ionic compounds; therefore, many biochemical reactions can take place
within a cell and in its immediate environment (the space between cells in a multicellular organism). This
is why it is important that cells and their environment are water based.
C. The pH of the aqueous environment inside a cell and its organelles influence many biological activities
such as the shape of proteins, the creation of proton gradients across membranes, and the speed at which
enzymes catalyze reactions.
1. Acidic solution—contains more H+ than OH– and has a pH below 7.
2. Basic solution—contains more OH– than H+ and has a pH above 7.
D. The following are the properties of water that make it an important molecule, and are due to the hydrogen
bonding between water molecules.
