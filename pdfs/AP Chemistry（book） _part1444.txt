he bonding MO and the 
antibonding MO of H2 is centered about the internuclear axis. MOs of this type are called 
sigma 1S2 molecular orbitals (by analogy to s bonds). The bonding sigma MO of H2 
is labeled s
1s; the subscript indicates that the MO is formed from two 1s orbitals. The anti-
bonding sigma MO of H2 is labeled s
1s
*  (read “sigma-star-one-s”); the asterisk denotes that 
the MO is antibonding.
The relative energies of two 1s atomic orbitals and the molecular orbitals formed from 
them are represented by an energy-level diagram (also called a molecular orbital 
diagram). Such diagrams show the interacting atomic orbitals on the left and right and 
the MOs in the middle, as shown in Figure 9.32. Like atomic orbitals, each MO can accom-
modate two electrons with their spins paired (Pauli exclusion principle). 
 (Section 6.7)
As the MO diagram for H2 in Figure 9.32 shows, each H atom has one electron, so 
there are two electrons in H2. These two electrons occupy the lower-ener
