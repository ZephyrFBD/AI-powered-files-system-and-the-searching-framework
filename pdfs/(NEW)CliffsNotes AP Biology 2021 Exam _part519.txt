of
traveling continuously down the axon, the action potential jumps from node to node (saltatory conduction), thereby
speeding up the propagation of the impulse.
A synapse, or synaptic cleft, is the gap that separates adjacent neurons. Transmission of an impulse across a
synapse, from presynaptic cell to postsynaptic cell, may be electrical or chemical. In electrical synapses, the action
potential travels through gap junctions, small tubes of cytoplasm that connect adjacent cells. In most animals,
however, most synaptic clefts are traversed by chemicals, as follows:
1. Calcium (Ca2+) gates open. When an action potential reaches the end of an axon, the depolarization of the
membrane causes voltage-gated
 
channels to open and allows Ca2+ to enter the cell.
2. Synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitter. The influx of Ca2+ into the terminal end of the axon causes
synaptic vesicles to merge with the presynaptic membrane, releasing molecules of a chemical called a
neurotransmitter into the
