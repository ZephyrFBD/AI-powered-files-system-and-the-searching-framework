ometric isomers of 2,4-hexadiene.
 24.35  (a) True or false: Alkenes undergo addition reactions and 
aromatic hydrocarbons undergo substitution reactions. 
 
(b) Using condensed structural formulas, write the bal-
anced equation for the reaction of 2-pentene with Br2 
and name the resulting compound. Is this an addition or 
a substitution reaction? (c) Write a balanced chemical 
equation for the reaction of Cl2 with benzene to make para- 
dichlorobenzene in the presence of FeCl3 as a catalyst. Is 
this an addition or a substitution reaction?
 24.36  Using condensed structural formulas, write a balanced 
chemical equation for each of the following reactions: 
(a) hydrogenation of cyclohexene, (b) addition of H2O to 
trans-2-pentene using H2SO4 as a catalyst (two products), 
(c) reaction of 2-chloropropane with benzene in the pres-
ence of AlCl3.
 24.37  (a) When cyclopropane is treated with HI, 1-iodopropane 
is formed. A similar type of reaction does not occur with 
cyclopentane or cyc
