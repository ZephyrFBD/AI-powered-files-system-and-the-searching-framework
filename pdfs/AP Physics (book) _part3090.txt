If a 62.0-kg person stands with both feet on the same step,
what is the gravitational potential energy of this person,
relative to the ground, on (a) the first step, (b) the second
step, (c) the third step, (d) the nth step? (e)What is the change
in energy as the person descends from step 6 to step 2?
