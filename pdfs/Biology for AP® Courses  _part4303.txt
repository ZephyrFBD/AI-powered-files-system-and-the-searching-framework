dioxide by algae would cause organisms that
require carbon dioxide to die out as well.
c.
Salinity and sunlight are both abiotic factors that
influence life in freshwater biomes. As
organisms living in freshwater biomes cannot
tolerate high salt levels, these organisms would
not survive if it were to increase significantly.
Many organisms that serve as food for others are
photosynthetic and would die if algal blooms
obscure light. Their decomposition and depletion
of oxygen by algae would cause organisms that
require oxygen to die out as well.
