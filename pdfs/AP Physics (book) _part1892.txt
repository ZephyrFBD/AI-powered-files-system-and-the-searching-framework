e ray tube (CRT), and as recently as
2008 they accounted for half of all new TV sales. Two years later it was tough to
find a new CRT set to buy. Even though new TV sets are flat screen plasma or
liquid crystal displays (LCD), an understanding of how a CRT works is useful.
CRT
The operation of a CRT depends on thermionic emission, discovered by Thomas
Edison (1847–1931). Consider a voltage applied to two small electrodes inside an
evacuated glass “tube” as shown in Fig. 17–28: the cathode is negative, and the
anode is positive. If the cathode is heated (usually by an electric current) so that
it becomes hot and glowing, it is found that negative charges leave the cathode
and flow to the positive anode. These negative charges are now called electrons,
but originally they were called cathode rays because they seemed to come from
the cathode (more detail in Section 27–1 on the discovery of the electron).
Figure 17–29 is a simplified sketch of a CRT which is contained in an evacuated
