(a) Do the C ¬OH bond of the acid and the O¬H bond 
of the alcohol break in the reaction, or do the O¬ H bond 
of the acid and the C ¬OH bond of the alcohol break? 
 
(b) Imagine a similar experiment using the radioisotope 3H, 
which is called tritium and is usually denoted T. Would the 
reaction between CH3COOH and TOCH3 provide the same 
information about which bond is broken as does the above 
experiment with H18OCH3?
 21.81  Each of the following transmutations produces a radionu-
clide used in positron emission tomography (PET). (a) In 
equations (i) and (ii), identify the species signified as “X.” 
(b) In equation (iii), one of the species is indicated as “d.” 
What do you think it represents?
  (i) 14N1p, a2X
  (ii) 18O1p, X218F
(iii) 14N1d, n215O
