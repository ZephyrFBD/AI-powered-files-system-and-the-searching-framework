on is in the blood, mostly in the form of hemoglobin. Most of the 
remainder is carried by transferrin.
A bacterium that infects the blood requires a source of iron if it is 
to grow and reproduce. The bacterium excretes a siderophore into the 
blood to compete with transferrin for iron. The equilibrium constants

Nomenclature and Isomerism  
in Coordination Chemistry
When complexes were first discovered, they were named after the chemist who origi-
nally prepared them. A few of these names persist, as, for example, with the dark red sub-
stance NH43Cr(NH3)2(NCS)44, which is still known as Reinecke’s salt. Once the structure
