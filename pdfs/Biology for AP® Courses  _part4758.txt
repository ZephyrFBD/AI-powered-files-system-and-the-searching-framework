ly breed new varieties to keep up with
evolving pest organisms. These same seed companies, however, have participated in the decline of the number of varieties
available as they focus on selling fewer varieties in more areas of the world.
The ability to create new crop varieties relies on the diversity of varieties available and the accessibility of wild forms related
to the crop plant. These wild forms are often the source of new gene variants that can be bred with existing varieties to create
varieties with new attributes. Loss of wild species related to a crop will mean the loss of potential in crop improvement.
Maintaining the genetic diversity of wild species related to domesticated species ensures our continued food supply.
Since the 1920s, government agriculture departments have maintained seed banks of crop varieties as a way to maintain crop
diversity. This system has flaws because, over time, seed banks are lost through accidents, and there is no way to replace
them. In 2008,
