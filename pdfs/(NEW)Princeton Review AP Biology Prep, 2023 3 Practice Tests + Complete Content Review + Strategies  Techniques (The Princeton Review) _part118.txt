he words in the Key Terms lists throughout this book. Know them backward
and forward. As you learn them, make sure you group them by association, since the College Board is bound to ask
about them on the AP Biology Exam. What do we mean by “word associations”? Let’s take the example of mitosis
and meiosis.
You’ll soon see from our review that there are several terms associated with mitosis and meiosis. Synapsis, crossing-
over, and tetrads, for example, are words associated with meiosis but not mitosis. We’ll explain what these words
mean later in this book. For now, just take a look.
8. In mitosis, plant cytokinesis differs from animal cytokinesis. Scientists studying the process have hypothesized
that the Golgi apparatus sends cellulose in vesicles to form a cell plate between plant daughter cells. Which of
the following questions will help guide the scientists toward a direct test of their hypothesis?
(A) In what types of cells do homologous chromosomes exchange DNA through crossing
