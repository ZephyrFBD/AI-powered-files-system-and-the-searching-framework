■ ARE STUDENTS READY TO COMPLETE A SUCCESSFUL 
INQUIRY-BASED, STUDENT-DIRECTED INVESTIGATION? 
This investigation reinforces the following skills: 
• Using pipettes (plastic bulb-type or other volumetric measuring devices) 
• Measuring temperature (°C) 
• Applying metric system 
• Applying quantitative skills 
■ Skills Development 
Students will develop the following skills: 
• Using sterile technique 
• Disposing properly of materials and solutions that come in contact with bacteria 
• Transferring bacterial colonies from agar plates to microtubes 
• Transforming bacterial cells with plasmid DNA 
• Delivering transformed cultures to agar plates 
• Applying mathematics to quantify transformation efficiency 
■ Potential Challenges 
With any type of microbiology technique, including working with and culturing 
bacteria, it is imp
