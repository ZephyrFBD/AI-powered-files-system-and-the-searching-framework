ction? (c) Would you classify NO 
as a catalyst or as an intermediate? (d) Is this an example 
of homogeneous catalysis or heterogeneous catalysis?
 14.80 The addition of NO accelerates the decomposition of 
N2O, possibly by the following mechanism:
NO1g2 + N2O1g2 ยก N21g2 + NO21g2
 
      2 NO21g2 ยก 2 NO1g2 + O21g2
 
 (a) What is the chemical equation for the overall reac-
tion? Show how the two steps can be added to give the 
overall equation. (b) Is NO serving as a catalyst or an in-
termediate in this reaction? (c) If experiments show that 
during the decomposition of N2O, NO2 does not accumu-
late in measurable quantities, does this rule out the pro-
posed mechanism?
 14.81 Many metallic catalysts, particularly the precious-metal 
ones, are often deposited as very thin films on a sub-
stance of high surface area per unit mass, such as alumina 
1Al2O32 or silica 1SiO22. (a) Why is this an effective way of 
utilizing the catalyst material compared to having pow-
dered metals? (b) How
