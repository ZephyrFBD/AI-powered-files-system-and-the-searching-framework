(a) Six AOs require six MOs (b) zero nodes in the lowest energy 
orbital (c) Ô¨Åve nodes in highest energy orbital (d) two nodes in the 
HOMO (e) three nodes in the LUMO (f) The HOMO-LUMO energy 
gap for the six-atom diagram is smaller than the one for the four-
atom diagram. In general, the more atoms in the chain, the smaller 
the  HOMO-LUMO energy gap. 12.53 (a) Ag is more ductile. Mo 
has stronger metallic bonding, a stiffer lattice, and is less susceptible 
to distortion. (b) Zn is more ductile. Si is a covalent-network solid 
with a stiffer lattice than metallic Zn. 12.55 The order of increasing 
melting points is Y 6 Zr 6 Nb 6 Mo. Moving from Y to Mo, the 
number of valence electrons, occupancy of the bonding band, and 
strength of metallic bonding increase. Stronger metallic bonding 
requires more energy to break bonds and mobilize atoms, resulting 
some or all of the molecules do not rotate when the voltage is applied,
