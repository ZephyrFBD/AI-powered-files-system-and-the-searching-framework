rd Summaries/Questions
Students use diagrams (found online) of water drops, glucose, amino acids, nucleotides, 
glycerol, and fatty acids to learn how dehydration synthesis builds molecules. The 
templates can be printed on colored paper so that students can easily differentiate water 
from the various monomers in order to visualize the formation of the covalent bonds.

Think-Pair-Share
Students use cards containing pictures of biological molecules to find patterns in the 
molecules. Functional groups are identified and marked on each card, and then the cards are 
organized based on similarities in their structure. Students then learn about the properties of 
the molecules, and the students identify each of the molecules on the cards.
