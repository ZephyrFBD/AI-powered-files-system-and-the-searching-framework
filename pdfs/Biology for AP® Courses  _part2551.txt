a.
These three prokaryote groups have similar basic
structural features. They typically have cell
walls enclosing nuclear membranes, cytoplasm,
ribosomes, mitochondria and nucleoid region
with genetic material. They may have a
protective capsule, flagellum, pili and plasmids.
b.
Cocci and spirilli have similar basic structural
features. They typically have cell walls
enclosing cell membranes, a flagellum for
locomotion and pili for attachment. Bacilli are
rod shaped which contain ribosomes and a
nucleoid region with genetic material.

These three prokaryote groups have similar basic
structural features. They typically have cell
walls enclosing cell membranes, cytoplasm,
ribosomes and a nucleoid region with
chromosomes. They may have a protective
capsule, flagellum, pili and plasmids.

features. They typically have cell walls
