hormone (GHIH), also called somatostatin.
Figure 28.13 Growth hormone directly accelerates the rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and bones. Insulin-
like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is activated by growth hormone and also allows formation of new proteins in muscle cells
and bone. (credit: modification of work by Mikael Häggström)
A balanced production of growth hormone is critical for proper development. Underproduction of GH in adults does
not appear to cause any abnormalities, but in children it can result in pituitary dwarfism, in which growth is reduced.
Pituitary dwarfism is characterized by symmetric body formation. In some cases, individuals are under 30 inches in height.
Oversecretion of growth hormone can lead to gigantism in children, causing excessive growth. In some documented cases,
individuals can reach heights of over eight feet. In adults, excessive GH can lead to acromegaly, a condition in which there
is enlargement of bones in the face, hands,
