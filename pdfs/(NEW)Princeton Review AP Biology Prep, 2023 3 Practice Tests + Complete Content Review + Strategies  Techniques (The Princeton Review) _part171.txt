1. Water is a critical component of life due to its unique structural and chemical properties. Which of the
following does NOT describe a way that the exceptional characteristics of water are used in nature to sustain
life?
(A) The high heat capacity of water prevents lakes and streams from rapidly changing temperature and freezing
completely solid in the winter.
(B) The high surface tension and cohesiveness of water facilitates capillary action in plants.
(C) The low polarity of water prevents dissolution of cells and compounds.
(D) The high intermolecular forces of water, such as hydrogen bonding, result in a boiling point which exceeds
the tole
