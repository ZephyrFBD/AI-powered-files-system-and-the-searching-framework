What is the relationship between a genome and chromosomes?
10.2 | The Cell Cycle
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What processes occur during the three stages of interphase?
•
How do the chromosomes behave during the mitotic phase?
Connection for AP® Courses
The cell cycle describes an orderly sequence of events that are highly regulated. In eukaryotes, the cell cycle consists of
a long preparatory period (interphase) followed by mitosis and cytokinesis. Interphase is divided into three phases: Gap
1 (G1), DNA synthesis (S), and Gap 2 (G2). Interphase represents the portion of the cell cycle between nuclear divisions.
During this phase, preparations are made for division that include growth, duplication of most cellular contents, and
replication of DNA. The cell’s DNA is replicated during the S stage. (We will study the details of DNA replication in the
