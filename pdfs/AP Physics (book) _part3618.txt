32–10 The Standard Model: QCD
and Electroweak Theory
Not long after the quark theory was proposed, it was suggested that quarks have
another property (or quality) called color, or “color charge” (analogous to elec-
tric charge). The distinction between the six types of quark (u, d, s, c, b, t) was
referred to as flavor. According to theory, each flavor of quark can have one of
three colors, usually designated red, green, and blue. (These are the three primary
colors which, when added together in appropriate amounts, as on a TV screen,
produce white.) Note that the names “color” and “flavor” have nothing to do with
our senses, but are purely whimsical—as are other names, such as charm, in this
new field. (We did, however, “color” the quarks in Fig. 32–16.) The antiquarks are
colored antired, antigreen, and antiblue. Baryons are made up of t
