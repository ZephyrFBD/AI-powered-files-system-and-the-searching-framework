■ Where Can You Go from Here? 
An essential component of this investigation is to take it beyond the simple selection 
experiment. With the skills and knowledge gained in the selection experiment, you 
should be able to design new experiments to investigate the adaptive characteristics of 
the trait you studied. 
Start with a question of your own regarding hairs or some other variable quantitative 
trait, such as plant height, stem color, or flower number. For instance, in a closely 
related plant, one investigation demonstrated that herbivore damage early in the plant’s 
development led to increased trichome numbers in la
