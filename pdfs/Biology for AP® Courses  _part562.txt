iffusing: Heavier molecules move more slowly; therefore, they diffuse more slowly. The
reverse is true for lighter molecules.
•
Temperature: Higher temperatures increase the energy and therefore the movement of the molecules, increasing the
rate of diffusion. Lower temperatures decrease the energy of the molecules, thus decreasing the rate of diffusion.
•
Solvent density: As the density of a solvent increases, the rate of diffusion decreases. The molecules slow down
because they have a more difficult time getting through the denser medium. If the medium is less dense, diffusion
increases. Because cells primarily use diffusion to move materials within the cytoplasm, any increase in the
cytoplasm’s density will inhibit the movement of the materials. An example of this is a person experiencing
dehydration. As the body’s cells lose water, the rate of diffusion decreases in the cytoplasm, and the cells’ functions
deteriorate. Neurons tend to be very sensitive to this effect. Dehydration fre
