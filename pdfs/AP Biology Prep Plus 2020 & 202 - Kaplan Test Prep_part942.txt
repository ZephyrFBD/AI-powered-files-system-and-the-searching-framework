, with X emerging before Y. (C) is incorrect
because it is consistent with the tree as drawn; the emergence of
protein Z could simply be what caused 3 and 4 to occupy separate
branches. (D) is incorrect because, even though it would require
adding a new branch to the existing diagram, it would not require the
fundamental rearrangement necessary with (A).
17. D
Nondisjunction can occur when (1) sister chromatids fail to separate in
mitosis during anaphase, (2) homologous chromosomes fail to
separate in meiosis I, and (3) sister chromatids fail to separate during
meiosis II. The formation of one (N+1) gamete, one (N–1) gamete, and
two normal (N) gametes occurs when sister chromatids fail to separate
in meiosis II during anaphase II. One daughter cell divides normally
and produces two gametes with the normal number of chromosomes
(N). In the other daughter cell, the sister chromatids fail to separate,
resulting in two cells with an irregular number of chromosomes: one
(N+1) and one (N–1).
