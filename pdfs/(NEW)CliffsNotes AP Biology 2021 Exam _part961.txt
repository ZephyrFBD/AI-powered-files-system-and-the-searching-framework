 following:
 
58. C. The degrees of freedom (df) are the
number of observed phenotypic categories minus 1, or 4 − 1 = 3.
 
59. A. For a df of 3, the critical value for χ2 is 7.81 (p = 0.05, the
 
generally accepted probability for accepting the null hypothesis).
 
Because the value for χ2 for the data obtained in this question (χ2 = 4) is less that the critical value (χ2 = 7.81), the
null hypothesis is accepted.
The interpretation of these results is that there is more than a 5% chance that the difference between expected and
observed values can be explained by chance alone. To help understand what this means, consider the possible
extremes: If there were a 100% chance that the difference between expected and observed data could be explained
by chance, then the results are very accurate. That is, the expected and observed results don’t differ at all. In
contrast, if there were a 0% chance that the difference between expected and observed data could be explained by
chance, then the data
