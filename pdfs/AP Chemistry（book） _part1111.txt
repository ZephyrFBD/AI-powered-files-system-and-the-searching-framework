bshell is energetically unfa-
vorable, the electron affinity is highly positive. The electron affinities of Be and Mg are 
positive for the same reason; the added electron would reside in a previously empty p 
subshell that is higher in energy. 
The electron affinities of the group 5A elements are 
also interesting. Because these elements have half-filled 
p subshells, the added electron must be put in an orbital 
that is already occupied, resulting in larger electronâ€“elec-
tron repulsions. Consequently, these elements have elec-
tron affinities that are either positive (N) or less negative 
than those of their neighbors to the left (P
, As, Sb). Recall 
that in Section 7.4 we saw a discontinuity in the trends in 
first ionization energy for the same reason.
Electron affinities do not change greatly as we move 
down a group (Figure 7.12). With F, for instance, the added 
electron goes into a 2p orbital, for Cl a 3p orbital, for Br a 4p 
orbital, and so forth. As we proceed from F to I,
