hat changes in gravitational potential energy depend only
on the change in vertical height and not on the path taken.
Potential energy belongs to a system, and not to a single object alone. Poten-
tial energy is associated with a force, and a force on one object is always exerted
by some other object. Thus potential energy is a property of the system as a
whole. For an object raised to a height y above the Earthâ€™s surface, the change in
gravitational potential energy is mgy. The system here is the object plus the
Earth, and properties of both are involved: object (m) and Earth (g).
Potential Energy Defined in General
There are other kinds of potential energy besides gravitational. Each form of
potential energy is associated with a particular force, and can be defined analo-
gously to gravitational potential energy. In general, the change in potential energy
associated with a particular force is equal to the negative of the work done by 
that force when the object is moved from one poin
