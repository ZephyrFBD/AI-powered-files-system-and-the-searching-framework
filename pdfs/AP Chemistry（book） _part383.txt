° . We will consider 
two different ways of placing the atoms on a surface. In ar-
rangement A, all the atoms are lined up with one another 
to form a square grid. Arrangement B is called a close-packed 
arrangement because the atoms sit in the “depressions” 
formed by the previous row of atoms:
 2.91  (a) Assuming the dimensions of the nucleus and atom 
shown in Figure 2.10, what fraction of the volume of the atom 
is taken up by the nucleus? (b) Using the mass of the proton 
from Table 2.1 and assuming its diameter is 1.0 * 10-15 m, 
calculate the density of a proton in g>cm3.
 2.92  Identify the element represented by each of the following 
symbols and give the number of protons and neutrons in 
each: (a) 74
33X, (b) 127
53 X, (c) 152
63 X, (d) 209
83 X.
 2.93  The nucleus of 6Li is a powerful absorber of neutrons. It 
exists in the naturally occurring metal to the extent of 
7.5%. In the era of nuclear deterrence, large quantities 
of lithium were processed to remove 6Li fo
