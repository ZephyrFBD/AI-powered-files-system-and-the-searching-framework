l. In early August, a fission bomb using uranium was dropped on
Hiroshima and a second, using plutonium, was dropped on Nagasaki (Fig. 31â€“11),
both in Japan. World War II ended shortly thereafter.
Besides its destructive power, a fission bomb produces many highly radio-
active fission fragments, as does a nuclear reactor. When a fission bomb explodes,
these radioactive isotopes are released into the atmosphere as radioactive fallout.
Testing of nuclear bombs in the atmosphere after World War II was a cause
of concern, because the movement of air masses spread the fallout all over the globe.
Radioactive fallout eventually settles to the Earth, particularly in rainfall, and is
absorbed by plants and grasses and enters the food chain. This is a far more serious
problem than the same radioactivity on the exterior of our bodies, because 
and
particles are largely absorbed by clothing and the outer (dead) layer of skin. But
inside our bodies as food, the isotopes are in contact with living c
