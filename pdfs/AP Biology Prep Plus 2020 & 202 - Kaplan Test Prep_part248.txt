aves form thorns in cacti, tendrils in pea plants, and petals in flowers.
The leaves produce all of the energy of the plant and are specialized to
gather sunlight. The broad shape helps to gather sunlight for themselves
and in some cases to block sunlight from getting to competing plants.
The shape and arrangement of leaves are key features used to distinguish
plant species.
Terrestrial plants have broad leaves that maximize the absorption of
sunlight but also tend to increase water loss by evaporation. Leaves of
terrestrial plants have a waxy cuticle on top to conserve water. The lower
epidermis of the leaf is punctuated by stomata: openings that allow
diï¬€usion of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and oxygen between the leaf
interior and the atmosphere. A loosely packed spongy layer of cells inside
the leaf contains chloroplasts with air spaces around cells. Another
photosynthetic layer in the leaf, the palisade layer, consists of more
densely packed elongated cells spread over a large sur
