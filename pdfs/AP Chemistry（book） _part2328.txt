 14.56 For the elementary process N2O51g2 ¡ NO21g2 +  
NO31g2 
the activation energy 1Ea2 and overall ∆E are 154 kJ>mol 
and 136 kJ>mol, respectively. (a) Sketch the energy pro-
file for this reaction, and label Ea and ∆E. (b) What is the 
activation energy for the reverse reaction?
 14.57 Indicate whether each statement is true or false.
(a) If you compare two reactions with similar collision 
factors, the one with the larger activation energy will 
be faster.
(b) A reaction that has a small rate constant must have a 
small frequency factor.
(c) Increasing the reaction temperature increases the 
fraction of successful collisions between reactants.
 14.58 Indicate whether each statement is true or false.
(a) If you measure the rate constant for a reaction at dif-
ferent temperatures, you can calculate
