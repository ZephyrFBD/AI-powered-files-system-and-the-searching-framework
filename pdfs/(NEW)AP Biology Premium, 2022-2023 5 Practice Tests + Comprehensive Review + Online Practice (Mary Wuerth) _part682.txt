 Without
limiting factors, organisms will exhibit exponential growth. Density-dependent limits will cause populations to
grow in a logistic manner. The resources available determine an environmentâ€™s carrying capacity.
56. (C) In repressible operons, the repressor protein needs to bind to a corepressor to be capable of binding to the
operator. The corepressor is often the product produced by the operon. In the trp operon, the amino acid
tryptophan serves as the corepressor. When excess amounts of tryptophan are available, tryptophan binds to the
repressor, which then binds to the operator. This prevents transcription of the operon by RNA polymerase and
prevents the production of more tryptophan. Choice (A) is incorrect because while it does show tryptophan
bound to the repressor, the repressor is not bound to the operator. In choice (B), the repressor is bound to the
operator but without its corepressor, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because it shows
tryptophan bou
