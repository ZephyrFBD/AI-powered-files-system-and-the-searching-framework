r the AP Exam 
On the exam, students frequently can 
correctly identify an organelle but fail to 
accurately describe its function. Students 
should be able to explain the relationships 
between structure and function on both 
the subcellular and cellular level. Avoid 
using catchy analogies (e.g., cell city) and 
food-based models because on the exam 
students tend to write about the analogy 
without demonstrating an understanding 
of its underlying concept using appropriate 
terminology. 
The graphing skills learned in this unit are 
important. Students should be able to label 
the independent and dependent variables 
with units, correctly plot data points with 
appropriate scaling, and correctly represent 
the data in question. For instance, a line 
graph should be used for continuous 
data and a bar graph for categorical data. 
Students often fail to earn points because 
they draw error bars incorrectly and fail to 
use them to draw conclusions about the 
significance of the data.
