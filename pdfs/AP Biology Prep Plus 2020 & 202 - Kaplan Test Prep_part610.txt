r. (D) is incorrect because the gene is controlled by an
activator, not a repressor; in addition, operons are not always
controlled by repressors.
3. C
Learning Objective: 14.3
According to the table, workers express more genes relating to
responding to stimuli than do queens. This suggests that they may
need greater use of their sense organs, perhaps for activities such as
foraging. (C) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because queens express
more genes relating to biological regulation. (B) is incorrect because
queens express considerably more genes relating to developmental
processes. (D) is incorrect because workers express more genes
relating to metabolic processes.
4. B
Learning Objective: 14.4
In order for phenotypic changes to be similar, the genes aﬀected in
both fruit flies and honeybees should also be similar. (B) is thus
correct. (A) is incorrect because the regulation of diﬀerent genes is
unlikely to produce similar phenotypic changes in the two species. (C)
and (D) are in
