ses, and spreads out after passing
through narrow slits. This bending gives rise to a diffraction
pattern due to interference between rays of light that travel
different distances.
Light passing through a very narrow slit of width D (on
the order of the wavelength ) will produce a pattern with a
bright central maximum of half-width given by
(24;3a)
flanked by fainter lines to either side.
Light reflected from the front and rear surfaces of a thin
film of transparent material can interfere constructively or
destructively, depending on the path difference. A phase change
of 180° or
occurs when the light reflects at a surface where
the index of refraction increases. Such thin-film interference
has many practical applications, such as lens coatings and using
Newton’s rings to check uniformity of glass surfaces.
In unpolarized light, the electric field vectors oscillate in all
transverse directions. If the electric vector oscillates only in one
plane, the light is said to be plane-polarized
