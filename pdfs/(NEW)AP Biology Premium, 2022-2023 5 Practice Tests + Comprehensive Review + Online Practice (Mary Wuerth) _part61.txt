 the same standard deviation, the data set
with the smaller sample size (Data Set X, which has n = 10) will have a larger standard error of the mean than
Data Set Y, which has a larger sample size (n = 50).
8. (C) The standard error of the mean is a way to measure the variability or spread of a data set. The larger the
standard error of the mean, the greater the variability in the data set. Since data collected in San Rafael has the
highest standard error of the mean, San Rafael has the greatest variability in the data.
9. (B) The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for data from Oakville (25.1) is less than the lower limit of
the 95% confidence interval for data from Oak Valley (30.1). So their 95% confidence intervals do not overlap
and there is likely a significant difference between the oak tree heights in those two locations. Choice (A) is
incorrect because the 95% confidence interval for the data from Sacramento overlaps with the 95% confidence
interval for the data from O
