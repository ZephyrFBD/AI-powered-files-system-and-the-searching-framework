Show that this is consistent with the two definitions of the
roentgen given in the text.
46. (II) A 1.6-mCi source of 
(in 
), a 
emitter, is
implanted in a tumor where it is to administer 32 Gy. The
half-life of 
is 14.3 days, and 1.0 mCi delivers about
Approximately how long should the source
remain implanted?
47. (II) What is the mass of a 2.50-
source?
48. (II) 
emits 122-keV 
rays. If a 65-kg person swallowed
of 
what would be the dose rate 
averaged over the whole body? Assume that 50% of the 
-ray energy is deposited in the body. [Hint: Determine
the rate of energy deposited in the body and use the defi-
nition of the gray.]
49. (II) Ionizing radiation can be used on meat products to
reduce the levels of microbial pathogens. Refrigerated
meat is limited to 4.5 kGy. If 1.6-MeV electrons irradiate
5 kg of beef, how many electrons would it take to reach the
allowable limit?
50. (III) Huge amounts of radioactive 
were released in the
accident at Chernobyl in 1986. Chemically, io
