tion; C in R¬ N “C “O is linear with sp hybrid-
ization; C in the urethane monomer is trigonal planar with sp2 
hybridization. Reaction (ii): C in COCl2 is trigonal planar with sp2 
hybridization; C in R¬ N “ C “O is linear with sp hybridization; C 
in the urethane monomer is trigonal planar with sp2 hybridization. 
(c) The greenest way to promote formation of the isocyanate is to 
remove by-product, either water or HCl, from the reaction mixture.

(b) ∆H = 0 for mixing ideal gases. ∆S is positive because the dis-
order of the system increases. (c) The process is spontaneous and 
therefore irreversible. (d) Since ∆H = 0, the process does not affect 
the entropy of the surroundings. 19.4 Both ∆H and ∆S are posi-
tive. The net change in the chemical reaction is the breaking of ﬁve 
blue-blue bonds. Enthalpies for bond breaking are always positive. 
There are twice as many molecules of gas in the products, so ∆S is 
positive for this reaction. 19.7 (a) At 300 K, ∆G = 0
