35. How can external stimuli alter post-transcriptional
control of gene expression?
a.
UV rays can alter methylation and acetylation of
proteins.
b.
RNA binding proteins are modified through
phosphorylation.
c.
External stimuli can cause deacetylation and
demethylation of the transcript.
d.
UV rays can cause dimerization of the RNA
binding proteins.
36. Protein modifications can alter gene expression in
many ways. Describe how phosphorylation of proteins can
alter gene expression.
a.
Phosphorylation of proteins can alter translation,
RNA shuttling, RNA stability or post
transcriptional modification.
b.
Phosphorylation of proteins can alter DNA
replication, cell division, pathogen recognition
and RNA stability.
c.
Phosphorylated proteins affect only translation
and can cause cancer by altering the p53
function.
d.
Phosphorylated proteins affect only RNA
shuttling, RNA stability, and post-translational
modifications.
37. Changes in epigenetic modifications alter the
accessibility and tr
