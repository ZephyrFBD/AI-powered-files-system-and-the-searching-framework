us system are quite pervasive. This is
both because one preganglionic neuron synapses on multiple postganglionic neurons, amplifying the effect of the original
synapse, and because the adrenal gland also releases norepinephrine (and the closely related hormone epinephrine) into the
blood stream. The physiological effects of this norepinephrine release include dilating the trachea and bronchi (making it
easier for the animal to breathe), increasing heart rate, and moving blood from the skin to the heart, muscles, and brain (so

the animal can think and run). The strength and speed of the sympathetic response helps an organism avoid danger, and
scientists have found evidence that it may also increase LTP—allowing the animal to remember the dangerous situation and
avoid it in the future.
Parasympathetic Nervous System
While the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations, the parasympathetic nervous system allows
an animal to “rest a
