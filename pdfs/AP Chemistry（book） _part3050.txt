CHAPTER 19 Chemical Thermodynamics
Calculating the Standard Entropy Change for a Reaction
The entropy change in a chemical reaction equals the sum of the entropies of the prod-
ucts minus the sum of the entropies of the reactants:
 
∆S° = a nS°1products2 - a mS°1reactants2 
[19.8]
As in Equation 5.31, the coefficients n and m are the coefficients in the balanced chemical 
equation for the reaction.
Entropy Changes in the Surroundings
We can use tabulated absolute entropy values to calculate the standard entropy change 
in a system, such as a chemical reaction, as just described. But what about the entropy 
change in the surroundings? We encountered this situation in Section 19.2, but it is good 
to revisit it now that we are examining chemical reactions.
We should recognize that the surroundings for any system serve essentially as a 
large, constant-temperature heat source (or heat sink if the heat
