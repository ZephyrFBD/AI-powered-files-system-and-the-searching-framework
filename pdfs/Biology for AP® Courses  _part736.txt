as catabolism, and such reactions are
associated with a release of energy. On the other end of the spectrum, anabolism refers to metabolic processes that build
complex molecules out of simpler ones, such as the synthesis of macromolecules. Anabolic processes require energy.
Glucose synthesis and glucose breakdown are examples of anabolic and catabolic pathways, respectively.
6.2 Potential, Kinetic, Free, and Activation Energy
Energy comes in many different forms. Objects in motion do physical work, and kinetic energy is the energy of objects in
motion. Objects that are not in motion may have the potential to do work, and thus, have potential energy. Molecules also
have potential energy because the breaking of molecular bonds has the potential to release energy. Living cells depend on
the harvesting of potential energy from molecular bonds to perform work. Free energy is a measure of energy that is
available to do work. The free energy of a system changes during energy transfers such as
