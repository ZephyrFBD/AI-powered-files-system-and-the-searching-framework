om, the more bonds it makes to 
other atoms.
 8.73 We can define average bond enthalpies and bond lengths 
for ionic bonds, just like we have for covalent bonds. Which 
ionic bond is predicted to be stronger, Na—Cl or Ca—O?
 8.74 We can define average bond enthalpies and bond lengths 
for ionic bonds, just like we have for covalent bonds. Which 
ionic bond is predicted to have the smaller bond enthalpy, 
Li—F or Cs—F?
 8.75 A carbene is a compound that has a carbon bonded to two 
atoms and a lone pair remaining on the carbon. Many 
carbenes are very reactive. (a) Draw the Lewis structure 
for the simplest carbene, H2C. (b) Predict the length of the 
carbon–carbon bond you would expect if two H2C mole-
cules reacted with each other by a combination reaction.
 8.76 Draw the Lewis structure for NO +. Is the nitrogen– 
oxygen bond in NO+ longer, shorter, or the same length as the 
 
nitrogen–oxygen bond in NO? Explain.
 
 8.70 Using Table 8.3, estimate ∆H for the following gas-phase
