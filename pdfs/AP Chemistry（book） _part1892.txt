cell. 
This difference leads to different coordination numbers. In sodium chloride, each 
cation and each anion are surrounded by six ions of the opposite type, leading to an 
octahedral coordination environment. In zinc blende, each cation and each anion 
are surrounded by four ions of the opposite type, leading to a tetrahedral coordina-
tion geometry. The cation coordination environments can be seen in Figure 12.26.

Do the anions touch each other in any of these three structures? If not, 
which ions do touch each other?
