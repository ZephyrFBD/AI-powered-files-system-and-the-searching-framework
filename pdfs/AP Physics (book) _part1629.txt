ained—but only if there is this 
difference of temperature. Similarly, in the gas turbine if the gas isn’t cooled,
the pressure on each side of the blades would be the same. By cooling the gas on
the exhaust side, the pressure on the back side of the blade is less and hence the
turbine turns.

Efficiency
The efficiency, e, of any heat engine can be defined as the ratio of the work it
does, W, to the heat input at the high temperature,
(Fig. 15–11):
(15;4a)
This is a sensible definition since W is the output (what you get from the engine),
whereas 
is what you put in and pay for in burned fuel. Since energy is con-
served, the heat input 
must equal the work done plus the heat that flows out
at the low temperature 
Thus
and the efficiency of an engine is
or
(15;4b)
To give the efficiency as a percent, we multiply Eq. 15–4 by 100. Note that e could
be 1.0 (or 100%) only if 
were zero—that is, only if no heat were exhausted 
to the environment (which we will see shortly never happens)
