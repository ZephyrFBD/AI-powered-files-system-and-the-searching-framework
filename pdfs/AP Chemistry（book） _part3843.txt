Give It Some Thought
When the aromatic hydrocarbon naphthalene, shown in Figure 24.10, reacts with 
nitric and sulfuric acids, two compounds containing one nitro group are formed. 
Draw the structures of these two compounds.

24.4 ∣ Organic Functional Groups
The C “C double bonds of alkenes and C ‚C triple bonds of alkynes are just two of 
many functional groups in organic molecules. As noted earlier, these functional groups 
each undergo characteristic reactions, and the same is true of all other functional groups. 
Each kind of functional group often undergoes the same kinds of reactions in every mol-
ecule, regardless of the size and complexity of the molecule. Thus, the chemistry of an 
organic molecule is largely determined by the functional groups it contains. Table 24.6 
lists the most common functiona
