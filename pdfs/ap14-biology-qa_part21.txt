lation as endothermic rather than ectothermic. Students 
incorrectly claimed that, as an endotherm, panting or sweating increases oxygen consumption or that the 
animal was hibernating. Students incorrectly claimed that the increased rate of oxygen consumption was a 
mechanism used by the animal to cool itself down i.e., oxygen consumption was the thermoregulatory 
behavior. Some students claimed that increased oxygen consumption causes increased metabolic rate. 
Based on your experience of student responses at the AP Â® Reading, what message would you 
like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of their students on 
the exam?  
Most students successfully analyzed the data and described that increased temperatures led to increased 
rates of oxygen consumption. However, students were not able to extend their thinking to the strategies 
organisms use to maintain homeostasis. Students were also challenged to connect the effect of 
environmental temperature on
