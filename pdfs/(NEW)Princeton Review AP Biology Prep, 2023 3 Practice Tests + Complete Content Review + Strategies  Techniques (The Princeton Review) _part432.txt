 This tendency to grow toward or away from the earth is
called gravitropism. All of these tropisms are examples of behavior in plants.
A tropism is a turning in response to a stimulus.
There are three basic tropisms in plants. You can remember them because their prefixes represent the stimuli to
which plants react:
Phototropism refers to the way plants respond to sunlightâ€”for example, bending toward light.
Gravitropism refers to the way plants respond to gravity. Stems exhibit negative gravitropism (they grow up,
away from the pull of gravity), whereas roots exhibit positive gravitropism (they grow downward into the
earth).
Thigmotropism refers to the way plants respond to touch. For example, ivy grows around a post or trellis.
These responses are initiated by hormones. The major plant hormones you need to know belong to a class called
auxins. Auxins serve many functions in plants. They can promote growth on one side of the plant. For example, in
phototropism, the side of the plant tha
