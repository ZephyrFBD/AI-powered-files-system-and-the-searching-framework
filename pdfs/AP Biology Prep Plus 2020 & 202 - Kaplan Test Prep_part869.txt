Table 1
 Changes in the mass of eggs immersed in varying percent corn syrup solutions
Describe whether the 0% and 100% solutions are hypertonic or hypotonic
relative to the eggs. Provide reasoning for your response.
(a)
The reaction of egg shells (calcium carbonate) with vinegar (4% acetic
acid) produces a water-soluble compound (calcium acetate) and carbon
dioxide gas. Explain why, prior to the experiment, students placed eggs in
vinegar overnight.
(b)
According to the data, determine the approximate percentage of corn
syrup at which the solution would be isotonic to the egg. Justify your
res
