bital (HOMO) is the MO of highest energy that has electrons 
in it. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is the MO 
 
of lowest energy that does not have electrons in it. In N2, for ex-
ample, the HOMO is the s
2p MO and the LUMO is the p

SOLUTION
(a) Sulfur is a group 6A element with an 3Ne43s23p4 electron con-
figuration. It is expected to be most similar electronically to 
oxygen (electron configuration, 3He42s22p4), which is imme-
diately above it in the periodic table.
(b) The Lewis structure of S8 is

There is a single bond between each pair of S atoms and two 
nonbonding electron pairs on each S atom. Thus, we see four 
electron domains around each S atom and expect a tetrahedral 
electron-domain geometry corresponding to sp3 hybridiza-
tion. Because of the nonbonding pairs, we expect the S ¬ S ¬S 
angles to be somewhat less than 109.5°, the tetrahedral angle.
